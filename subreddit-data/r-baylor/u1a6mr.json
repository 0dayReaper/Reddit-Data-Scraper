            "comment": "Finally something I feel qualified to talk about despite my time spent removed from Baylor as a student.  I\u2019m a graduate of the aviation program and current airline pilot, I loved the program and friends I made at Baylor.  Unfortunately, I can\u2019t speak to how hard it is to get in, it is different now than how it was when I went through.  What I can say is that it\u2019s a great program; I learned a lot and it definitely helped prepare me for the world of professional aviation.  Aviation is expensive, as is Baylor so be prepared for a higher cost than just Baylor tuition. However, it was definitely worth it in my mind.  I love what I do and make a great living traveling the world. Every year the Baylor aviation department has a banquet and I bid my schedule to go to it, so I try my best to stay involved with the program.  One of my favorite things about aviation is how small it\u2019s world really is.  One year at one of these banquets I met a Baylor aviation grad who was serving as the guest speaker, I was just a flight instructor at the time. Fast forward a few years and he\u2019s my captain across the ocean, I\u2019ve flown with him a few times now and actually texted him earlier today.\n\nFlight school takes its own time and studying to obtain all your certificates and ratings.  You\u2019ll end up having to do cross country flights, both solo and dual, on the weekends and at night.  It\u2019s not a typical 8-5 type of class schedule. \n\nI\u2019m happy to help answer any other questions you may have.",

FAA course material that could be done via self study that they expanded through the semester in two hour classes, they were boring.  The Baylor stuff was a lot more academically challenging, but interesting.  We did one class that was an airliner systems type class and at the end of the semester went its simulator and flew it for a bit.  As luck would have it my first airline rented the same sim I flew at Baylor, and I ended up taking my ATP checkride in that sim.",

He had to tune into class remotely or watch a recorded lecture a couple times because his plane had suffered some kind equipment failure/damage during an exam flight or the weather tuned bad and he had to stay at his turnaround location. Dude was super chill, I believe he is a commercial pilot now.",

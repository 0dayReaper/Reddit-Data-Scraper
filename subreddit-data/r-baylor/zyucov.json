    "postText": "I'm currently sitting at around a 3.2- 3.3 GPA and an ACT score of 26. I'm the secretary of my debate team plus I'm involved in the student newspaper. I believe I have an interesting story to tell in my essay in terms of my journey through the public education system. I didn't talk until I was an adolescent, plus my where parents where told when I was born I probably was going to be cared for, for the rest of my life. I progressed but for a year proceeding kindergarten I was placed in a special education program. I had a really bad speech problem which was corrected through frequent speech therapy classes throughout elementary school.\nEthnically I'm Caucasian and Indigenous Mexican (you wouldn't tell upon meeting me that I'm anything other than just a white guy)",

As much as I love Baylor, if you were going into 50-150k of debt to attend, I\u2019f you aren\u2019t going to have significant scholarships/parents help,  I\u2019d say don\u2019t do it.",

Also I heard from a student there but was unable to verify that they could invest in buissnesses that alumni want to start. But I looked up the tuition and geez I've given it a second thought.",

It is the largest Baptist university in the world, and a good medium sized.\n\n\nBut the tuition per semester hour has went from $355 in 2000 to  $1,477 a semester hour in 2022.  \n\nThat is per semester hour IF you are taking the most hours. Which is why I brought up tuition.   Again still apply! That is free, just don\u2019t attend if you aren\u2019t okay with the price tag when all things are considered.",

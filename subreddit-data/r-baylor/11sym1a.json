For T/TR, I think it\u2019s more like 7? \n\nWithout knowing the classes, it\u2019s impossible to say if you\u2019re screwed due to missing material, but you won\u2019t fail solely based on CASA\u2019s attendance policy (yet). That said, please make every effort to attend every class! This is your life and your education, and Baylor is much too expensive to fritter either of those things away.",

As another commenter mentioned, Baylor is way too expensive, and you don\u2019t want to run afoul of the attendance policy.\n\nTransfer and save adult you some headache if this will be a problem. I\u2019m not saying it is, and I don\u2019t know you at all. This is just a PSA for whoever needs to hear it.",

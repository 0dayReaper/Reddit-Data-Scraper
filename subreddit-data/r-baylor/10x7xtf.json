Most pay $7.25/hr and none will let you work more than 20hrs/week, which comes out to a raw $580/month maximum. \n\nThis is worth taking with a grain of salt, as it\u2019s very hard to get good grades at Baylor as well as working 20/hr per week. I would bank on, maximum, taking home $400 each month.",

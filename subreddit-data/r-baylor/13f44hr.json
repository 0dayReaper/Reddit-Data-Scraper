    "postText": "I graduated in 2004 but transferred into Baylor 2001. I was the last year of the old tuition grandfathered in before the rate hike starting in 2002. For the dorm, a generous meal plan and 17 hours of coursework, my tuition was roughly 16k a year. Back then that was expensive but overall good bang for the buck private school. The administration started the rate hike in 2002 as part of their Baylor 2012 vision of becoming a tier 1 institution.  They built a ton new buildings during this time but actually FELL in their rankings. Tier 1 isn\u2019t based on fancy buildings. It\u2019s based on professors and research publications/ quality. Baylor is very strict on hiring Christian professors so it limits their pool. They wanted to loosen this rule but the Southern Baptist convention threatened to pull their funding. \n\nIf I could choose today, Baylor wouldn\u2019t be in my top choice. It\u2019s ranked overall well but for the price tag, I would aim for a public university in similar rankings. I did like the Christian atmosphere for the most part, but a lot of public universities in the South have great student ministries too.",

Aim for good public schools, apply for as many scholarships as you can if you really want a Baylor, SMU, or Rice. If it doesn't work out, you'll be more than okay",

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same at rice, but profs here are super intentional/involved, which is great, but not so great if you like to slack off. So be aware of that. If you\u2019re needing to take physics or cs classes for requirements, take them at MCC. You\u2019re gpa will thank you big time. If you need to take calc courses, MCC is also great, but there\u2019s definitely a couple of gems in the math department. Also some really horrible options too, so tread lightly. Finding friends: your best bet is to plug into a church since Baylor is a very religious campus. But if you\u2019re not a Christian, I\u2019d say try getting into the intramural sports or greek life. Drop date for classes is earlier than most schools too I believe. There\u2019s also a foreign language requiring which requires you to take three or four semester hours of the same language. I feel like the culture here is very cliquey or \u201cboxy.\u201d So like people will stereotype you as a nerd or a sorority girl and it\u2019s not often that you see intermixing in these groups. But as long as you know love you are and put yourself out there you\u2019ll definitely find excellent friendships, even coming in as a transfer student. Also, party culture here is pretty different since it\u2019s a Christian campus. It\u2019s available, but there\u2019s way less available than at other campuses and it\u2019s not too difficult to develop a \u201ctrashy\u201d reputation here if you aren\u2019t careful. Also, Baylor is a dry campus and I know several people who\u2019ve gotten in trouble with the school after being caught with alcohol or drunk while on campus. Avoid the chick fil a on campus\u2026the lines are always WAY too long and you\u2019re better off driving to the one off campus. Watch out being alone in Waco at night, it\u2019s pretty sketchy. Even just going to grab take out. Be prepared for a million random road closures around campus because there\u2019s been a lot of construction and it\u2019s been a super chaotic and disorganized process, and the construction workers loooove just randomly shutting down roads on any given random day. Also, lots of businesses are closed on sundays. That\u2019s all I can think of right now",

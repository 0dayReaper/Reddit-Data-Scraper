We had a great time while we were there. I know he had some struggles just like we all do but noting particularly related to Baylor as an institution / experience that I recall.",

Faculty (and maybe all Baylor employees?) have to fill out a religion questionnaire during their interview process, and if they don\u2019t indicate that they follow a Christian faith (Baptist, Catholic, Lutheran, etc.), their entire application gets thrown out\u2026\n\nOr at least that\u2019s what my boss told me. Jewish is a gray area and there about 8-10 Jewish faculty total, so maybe there are a few Muslim faculty members too, but I haven\u2019t met any. I\u2019m not sure if any of this matters to you, just letting you know.",

Still it was nice to have her for 20+ years as part of the Baylor family.\n\nGlad Lady looks to be going into retirement after having the benign tumor last year\n\n&gt; The University will honor Joy in an on-campus memorial dedicated to the legacy of the past, present and future members of the Baylor Bear Habitat. Her sister, Lady, who is 20, will continue to receive the world-class supervision and protection of her caregivers in the Bill and Eva Williams Bear Habitat. In addition, for Lady\u2019s continued care as she ages into retirement, the University is moving forward on the construction of a **permanent retirement facility**, similar to their on-campus housing, at the Bears\u2019 off-campus enrichment area.",

I'm guessing that the campus is preparing to move younger bears whom are used to living in captivity to the campus as there has always been at least one available for students to see. It's very sad. I remember visiting the bears on slow school days and watch them lay around or play, depending on the time and day.",

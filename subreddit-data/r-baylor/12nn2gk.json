            "comment": "my understanding is it\u2019s a sub program under the honors college (like u schol or great texts) that you can participate in to provide extra opportunities like dinners and seminars (like the regular honors program) focused mainly on religion and philosophy rather than the broader or more random ones the regular honors program does. not certain if crane does but a lot of programs like these also open you up to apply for special scholarships that students outside of the program aren\u2019t allowed to. i haven\u2019t seen or heard anything relating to special crane scholarships but i wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this one does like other selective programs. \n\nbecause it\u2019s under the honors program you would have to apply and be accepted into the honors program first (highly recommend it based on my experience, also gives you an extra option for housing that isn\u2019t super difficult to get a room in because it\u2019s only honors students and you aren\u2019t fighting for a room with the other thousands of freshman who don\u2019t have the honors dorm option) so this is the same process as with u schol as it requires you to get into the honors college first then you can be selected for the u schol program. \n\n\nhonors in general has requirements you have to meet every year to stay in the program (so any sub program will require them so you remain eligible since they\u2019re part of the honors program):\n\nfreshman year- fall semester honors seminar class (i did trends in healthcare with dr. neilson and it was and still is my favorite out of all the classes i\u2019ve taken but it should be related to your major but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be it would just get you the most bang for your buck since it would count towards your major) then in the spring you start a two semester series of great texts classes. \n\nthroughout your four years- you have to take a colloquium normally spring sophomore or sometime junior year. you also have to keep a minimum 3.5 gpa and take at least one honors designated course every semester. (the seminar, great texts, and colloquium all count as your required honors course for those semesters.) there is an option for an exception for a semester if you either don\u2019t have an honors option that falls within your major or you have to take a hell semester that\u2019s super heavy and difficult but it isn\u2019t super common for most people to have to request an exception. \n\nsenior year- you do an honors senior thesis with a faculty mentor which is usually a fat research paper but some people do lab research or a business plan depending on their major. after it\u2019s finished you have to defend it to a panel but it\u2019s chill for a most people because your mentor will make sure your project is complete before they let you defend it. (i did lab research because i was an environmental health major and my sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was u schol doing computer science and philosophy so he did a fat research paper)\n\nthe sub programs may have certain extra requirements on top of the general honors ones but i only did the regular honors so i\u2019m not familiar with them. you should talk to your advisor (if you already have your advisor assignment or you can talk to your admissions counselor that you\u2019ve had through your baylor application process) to get more information on everything. \n\ni\u2019m not sure when the deadline is/ was to apply for honors if you\u2019re starting in august but if it\u2019s too late you can still apply sometime before the start of your junior year or if you have about 4 semesters left when you would start the program so you have time to complete the requirements. \n\nif you\u2019re interested in the honors dorm keep in mind that it\u2019s a two year contract rather than just one like most other dorms so you\u2019d have to stay there for freshman and sophomore year. after sophomore year you can of course stay in the honors dorm however many semesters after that or you can live off campus.",

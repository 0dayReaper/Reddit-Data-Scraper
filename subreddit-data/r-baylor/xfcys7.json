I was from another state, and I didn't find out until later that AP classes are worth 6 points in Texas.\n\nYour declared major might matter also. I didn't get into many places because I declared Computer Science, and it's very competitive. Don't pick your major based on this, but if you already picked a less competitive major, then you can relax a little bit.\n\nI didn't get the impression that your religion had any major affect on the admissions process. It seemed like they just used that information to give you relevant information once they were trying to convince you to choose Baylor.",

Ask some people who know you personally what they think is notable about your accomplishments. Sometimes what other people were impressed by is something you thought was really easy and forgot about. You can also mention anything that is unique to Baylor that you are excited about.\n\nEarly action/early decision might help you get in. Baylor is your first choice, so you should do it. Them receiving your application sooner rather than later probably helps more.\n\nI don't remember which designation I applied under, since I wasn't 100% sure Baylor was my choice until much later, so I'm sure whatever I picked didn't imply commitment. I can see from my emails that I finalized my application on November 24 and the acceptance came through December 3. This was in 2015, I'm sure they have more applicants these days, and it takes longer.\n\nAs an additional piece of advice, lookup the scholarships you can get from Baylor based on your SAT/ACT score. If you're right on the edge somehow, it might be worth taking the test one more time to get more scholarship money.",

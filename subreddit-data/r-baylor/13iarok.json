Jose lives in room 10 with the weird home school kid and the guys in room 12 like to wake up to Beasty Boys \u201cintergalactic planetary\u201d so screw those guys, but room 11 are cool dudes every year.  Land that room and you will basically be the coolest kids east of I35 but west of the fountain mall.",

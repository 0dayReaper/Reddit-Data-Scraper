    "postText": "Has anyone received any grants or federal aid for Baylor? I have received my scholarship information, but I didn't receive any aid such as grants so I was really confused. Have they released it? I believed I was supposed to get some sort of grants because both my brothers receive grants to go to their schools (Trinity University and Stephen F. Austin) If anyone recommends doing anything about this please let me know!!!",

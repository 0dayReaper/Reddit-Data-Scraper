    "postText": "Hello all, I recently got into Baylor and it was a shock. I\u2019ve seen they give a merit scholarship to 86% of those who get accepted. I got 0 merit and Baylor seems out of my price range for obvious reasons. Baylor was definitely my top school I\u2019ve been wanting to attend, but I guess I will have to keep looking. I\u2019ve also applied to about 30 external scholarships but who even knows if I\u2019ll get any. :( maybe I\u2019ll try to apply to Baylor for grad school with a higher gpa. Also, my parents won\u2019t help me out with paying for college at all so.. anyone know any help in this type of circumstance",

It\u2019s an incredible amount that will burden you well into adulthood and will affect every milestone in your life (getting married, having children, buying a home, retiring, etc.). Your future self may be thankful that you took a more affordable route to getting a degree.\n\nTo my friends and family, I don\u2019t recommend anyone going to a private uni unless they get a great scholarship offer or their family can pay for it. A review of the personal finance subreddit and seeing how people struggle daily with student loan may help in your decision. \n\nI wish you the best.",

If you're making $36k in your first job, if you could find an apartment that rents for around $1k (good luck), then you pay $1k in student loans. When you consider that taxes will be around $600, health insurance on $300, you're left with about $100 a month for car payments, car insurance, food, groceries, and anything fun you might eke out on the remaining $100. \n\nThere isn't a cute saying like \"three months wages,\" or \"a third of your monthly income,\" to figure out how much you can afford to take out in loans. I think a good rule of thumb is that you should make more in your first year of working than your student loans will be. I say that as someone who only earned more than my debt was after 5 years. Learn from my mistakes, I beg of you.",

When Baylor gives people an acceptance letter at sticker, what they're saying is, \"We don't want you to come here that badly, but if you really want to come anyway and subsidize the people we do want here, we won't stand in your way.\"\n\nI know people who went there under those circumstances. The ones whose parents were paying for everything and could afford it did fine. The ones who were on the hook for it themselves had a really bad time of it when those bills came due.\n\nIf you're really set on attending, go to a different school for your first year, knock it out of the park academically and apply as a transfer and see if some merit aid will come your way then. Retake the GRE/SAT for a higher score if possible.",

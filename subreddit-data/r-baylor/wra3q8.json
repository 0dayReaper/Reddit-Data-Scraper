    "postText": "So as I got to know more about my classes the more I freaked out. Here\u2019s what I have:\n\nGenetics Lab/Lecture (which apparently has a prelab and postlab quiz)\nMolecular cell with Abel (Homework before every class) T/TH\nUS History with Benham (Quiz before every class) M/W/F\nOchem with Zinke (obviously I need to practice a lotttt)\nChristian Heritage with Wells (I took scriptures over the summer and it was not a piece of cake, but maybe that\u2019s just because it was a summer course)\n\nLemme just say, for my past semesters, yes it was not easy but I never felt so burdened before. I truly have no idea how to even manage this without timing my day to the minute which I really hate doing.\n\nLike I have a quiz due every single day for this entire semester, I can\u2019t even imagine exam season.\n\nI move in on the 20th (yes I know it\u2019s late) so I\u2019m putting off everything till I get to campus.",

My best advice is as much as possible work from 8-5 if you can do that I guarantee the semester will be easier.",

Most of these assignments are so intensive because the profs want you to actively learn and have lots of feedback, rather than spending hours and hours rereading your notes.\n You don\u2019t need to plan to the minute, but block a few hours (give or take) each day to sit down and focus. Your planner will be your best friend for keeping track of assignments, as well as the calendar in Canvas.\n\nAnd it really will be okay. I\u2019m not super smart, but my sophomore fall I had ochem, achem, intro to neuro, peer leadership, and a great texts capstone and I made it through. You can too.",

Christian Heritage is not as reading intensive as scriptures and, at least when I took it, was more historical and philosophical. If you can learn a bit about the historical background during certain time periods it\u2019ll give a good indication on how a lot of beliefs and narratives are formed and why they\u2019re significant within the context of that period\u2019s theological discourse.",

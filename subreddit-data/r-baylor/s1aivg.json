Get together with your favorite professor or someone whose research you\u2019re interested in, ask if they\u2019re working on any current project and see if you can join in. \nYou would meet on a regular basis with that professor and maybe a few graduate students on the project. \n\nIf the project/research is promising, you can co-publish a paper or present a poster on it, add it to your resume. And you\u2019ll most likely get a good grade on the course. 2 birds 1 stone.",

It\u2019s a great way to study a particular area that interests you with a faculty member who\u2019s an expert in that field. The professor will suggest a few topics to explore and maybe some sources/books you can look into. At a time that\u2019s convenient for both of you, on a regular basis, you can meet and discuss, develop a paper.",

I also took the lab, BIO 3103, with it. It was not only interesting but also boosted my science GPA. It helped me get into med school a year later.",

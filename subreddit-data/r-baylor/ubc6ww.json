I wouldn't recommend buying all your books yet, cuz some professors don't use them even though they are listed as required. But for your core classes, its a safe bet you'll use those books quite a bit. So I would recommend getting a book for whatever bio class you have registered and probably chem as well.",

This will make studying for the MCAT a lot easier down the road. I graduated from Baylor as a psych pre-med last year; I'm at CUSM in California now but if I could go back, I would've done this. Good luck with the pre-med council; in my opinion, getting the Committee Recommendation should be one of your top priorities ([https://www.baylor.edu/prehealth/index.php?id=955383](https://www.baylor.edu/prehealth/index.php?id=955383)).",

I ended up picking baylor because it was a lot smaller, and (from what I\u2019ve heard) class sizes are also a lot smaller. I personally learn better that way. From the premed students I\u2019ve spoken to from both schools, UT students say the premed experience is more \u201cindividual\u201d and the baylor pre med experience is more \u201ctogether\u201d u just have to figure out what environment will work best for you regardless of stats and ranks (at least that\u2019s what I did) i have a sibling at UT majoring in comp sci and he also agrees that his experience is very independent aside from office hours. \n\ntuition difference:\nfor me personally, the tuition for both UT and Baylor is around the same bc of scholarships and aid. I\u2019d say go where you will pay the least. both schools are amazing for pre med! if money is not an issue, I\u2019d say really look into what environment u find yourself growing in. small community or large community? again, both schools have wonderful communities. your college experience really depends on what you make of it in my opinion:)\n\ngetting into Baylor pre med: \nI\u2019m not sure if you took the SAT, but the website (link below) says if you have a 1180 with greater than a 570 on the math section (or ACT 24 with 24 on math) you qualify. if you did not take the SAT, you were holistically reviewed. the website also says \u201cIf a student is admitted to Baylor, but does not qualify for the Pre Med/Pre Dent designation, they may retest and submit new scores to Undergraduate Admissions. Updated scores must be received and processed by August 1.\u201d Other than test scores, there is also a course requirement to be officially designated. \u201cCurrent students may receive the premedical or predental designation once they have received credit for PHP 1105 (Foundations of Medicine) OR PHP 1206 (Introduction to Health Professions) and meet one of the following requirements:\n\nEarn a 3.0 cumulative GPA or better after 30 credit hours at Baylor University\nEarn a 3.0 cumulative GPA or better in 12 or more credit hours of biology, chemistry, physics, and math/statistics classes at Baylor University\u201d\n\nnot sure if this was any help, definitely talk to your admissions counselor though! good luck :) \n\nwebsite: https://www.baylor.edu/prehealth/index.php?id=930453",

            "comment": "Freshman bio is actually quite hard. These numbers may be a little wrong. But I believe in 2020 75% of he freshman class came in premed and by the end of the first year it was trimmed down to 25%. A lot of that is because of Bio 1 and 2. \n\nIt\u2019s not just about study material, if you don\u2019t spend the time during the semester you will do poorly. Each chapter takes at least 3 hours of reading/notes and to have an A you might need to do even more than that.\n\nOne suggestion would be to get the Campbell bio book and start early. Then you will just be relearning later. Bio I promise will be your hardest class first semester.\n\nAlso if you\u2019re taking psychology be warned that it\u2019s not as easy as other colleges. For me it was as hard as Bio if not harder.",

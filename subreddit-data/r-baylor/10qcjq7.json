Baylor costs too damn much to feel like an outsider all the time.\n\nIf you want to contribute to your community at Baylor, you should seek out the Bobo Spiritual Life Center. They're the best underutilized resource at Baylor and a great and welcoming place for outsiders.",

You definitely should not feel like it's Baylor, SFA, or bust just because you missed this year's deadlines, and deadlines being missed are not a good enough reason to take on a ton of debt. Take a year, apply early to everywhere you're interested in being, and take that time as a moment of rest before starting the rest of your life.",

(More than a lot of people would expect tbh) I thought I would be pretty much alone when I was accepted to my program but I found a lot of other people like me. So if you know how to look for your type of people i'm sure you can find them.",

At Baylor I think it would just be a lot more work.",

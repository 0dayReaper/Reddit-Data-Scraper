            "comment": "Baylor, like many private schools that aren't at Ivy League levels of prestige, basically uses financial aid (or lack thereof) as their informal admissions process.\n\nIf Baylor gives you an offer of admission but no scholarships, they're basically saying, \"We don't think you should come here. But if you want to, we're not going to stand in your way, and the full price tuition you're paying will subsidize the kids we actually do want to come here.\"\n\nIf you have rich parents, they probably won't care. I knew people for whom that was the case. But going to Baylor at full price and paying for it with loans would be a *very bad* idea and I would strongly advise against it.",

But I don't think what we're saying is incongruent, I think we're both saying that they really ramped up acceptances this year and that's likely why the acceptance rate jumped so high. But I think the reason it jumped so high is probably a combo of pandemic uncertainty and reduced enrollment last year, and them trying to grow as a school (they were bragging about this during grad school orientation). The reason they were then trying to deter students after that likely had to do with more students enrolling than predicted.",

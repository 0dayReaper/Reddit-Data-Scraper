            "comment": "Recruiting/development is impossible to answer with great accuracy IMO, their sample size is too small and the obstacles they've faced are unique. \n\nRhule was only here 3 years. Aranda is about to finish his 3rd.\n\nHow do you judge a guy's recruiting for his system and development of those players for that system when they haven't seen any of their own guys graduate under them, esp when it comes to Lines?\n\nRhule took over after Baylor was rocked by the scandal. There was a SINGLE recruit left in his class and Rhule had like 2 months to fill out the class. So a lot of the guys he worked with and developed weren't the type of guys that necessarily even fit his system as much as were players he could get. Rhule never had a win against a ranked opponent while at Baylor. \n\nAranda took RIGHT before COVID which def made recruiting and installing the system a much rougher journey under normal circumstances. 2020 only being 9 games def didn't help. One could argue a single mistake around QB or OC staffing decisions has cost Baylor 2-3 games this year. \n\nBoth coaches were awarded B12 coach of the year. Both took a team to the Sugar Bowl. Both went to a conference title game.\n\nSomeone more knowledgeable could to maybe speak towards the XO's",

People post unsubstantiated shit all the time; 95% of the time it's backed up with Qanon lvl coincidence/reasoning.  \n\n\n\nIf Rhule is a front runner for y'all I'd be optimistic. One thing he did at Baylor that I really liked was he made sure to staff as many positions as he could with people from Central Texas who had established recruiting pipelines and connections. That helped a ton when it came to recruiting in his 2nd and 3rd year, many of those people were retained by Aranda (for me that proves how valuable those guys are). \n\n\nAre Nebraska fans convinced they could pull Rhule or Aranda?",

            "comment": "&gt;1) Better X's and O's guy?\n\nProbably Aranda. This isn't a slight against Rhule though. Aranda has been called by some people the smartest defensive mind in football. Not just college football but football in general. Rhule's background has involved him being a position coach at pretty much every position. He strikes me as a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" type. Which can actually be really beneficial for a head coach.\n\n&gt;2) Better at player development? \n\nUntil proven otherwise, this has to go to Rhule. He put together the bulk of the 2019 and 2021 teams that made the Big 12 title games and Sugar Bowls.\n\n&gt;3) Better at recruitment? \n\nThere's really no way to compare them here. The 2023 class Aranda is putting together might be the best Baylor class of the modern recruiting era. But he's also in a much more favorable position than Rhule ever was because Baylor is further away from scandal. It's possible that Aranda's resume (a national championship as a coordinator and a Big 12 title as a head coach) draws the attention of a caliber of recruit that Rhule never really had a chance at. But Rhule was also excellent at identifying underrated recruits with raw talent.\n\n&gt;4) Better overall?\n\nAgain, I don't think you can make an apples-to-apples comparison here. I'd say that Rhule was maybe the best possible coach to take over after the scandal of the previous regime. But he also made no secret of his desire to eventually coach in the NFL. Aranda, on the other hand, is probably the better long-term fit. He's probably better at adapting to the changing landscape of college sports and he seems much more interested in leading young men, both on and off the football field.",

College football as a whole has evolved in a way that isn't favorable to the Cornhuskers in that way.\n\nThat said, there's no reason why Nebraska can't be at the same level as what Wisconsin has been for most of the past 20 years, especially since Nebraska as a university is probably much more committed to football than Wisconsin is. Honestly, Nebraska's ceiling should be something along the lines of Penn State (especially once the Big Ten does away with divisions) as a tier just below Ohio State and Michigan but better than the rest of the conference.\n\nAnd Rhule's history at Temple and Baylor suggests that he can in fact be the coach who builds up a program to its potential. The question is whether or not he would choose to stay there if he did find success.",

Yeah, guys left for the draft but this is college football. Part of the deal for being a successful college coach is being able to develop talent so you always have people coming in ready to excel. Aranda failed at that this year. I think Rhule is a good college coach, but obviously not a good NFL coach. They\u2019re different skill sets. I hope Aranda learns from this year.

To me, the biggest difference is that overall I see growth in Aranda and feel as though he learns from mistakes. However, I think Rhule is fairly set in his style and is likely at his ceiling. I think this season was a bit of a weird one with a lot of fairly inexperienced guys. Can't send as many players to the draft as we did and not expect a step back (unless you're Bama or Georgia).",

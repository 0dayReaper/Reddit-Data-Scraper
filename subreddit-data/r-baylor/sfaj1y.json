They had me draw a slip of paper from a hat which told me when I would go to bedtime. I think the two options were either 10pm or 1am. Then I got into the bed (which was in a room that resembled an actual bedroom) and they hooked me up to some wires plugged into a machine. I went to sleep, was waken up, retook the same tests as earlier, got my gift card, and left. It was all very straightforward and kind of cool!",

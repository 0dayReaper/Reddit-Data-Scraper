I def failed some but I studied super hard for them and aced a bunch and consistently went to office hour to meet with him about them. I think it came down to the fact that I showed a lot of effort throughout the semester, so my final reflected that I guess? The numbers may have worked out to bump me up enough but I never even tried to calculate it. Genetics is tough, esp w miles so a B is still fantastic in that course!!!\n\nI studied by going thru my old notes and reviewing what I assumed to be high yield material. I can't remember if we had our old tests and quizzes, but if u do I would def study that. When studying come up with questions to ask yourself and ask how Miles would ask. make them super hard on yourself so you are prepared for any question!",

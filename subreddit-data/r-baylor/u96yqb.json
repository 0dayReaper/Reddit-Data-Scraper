            "comment": "My husband (sorry not a girls perspective) was a mechanical engineering major there and enjoyed it. Baylor engineering is more quality over quantity. There are not as many major options as some schools more well known for engineering but he got a good education, good internships, good extracurriculars and a great job after graduating. There were not a ton of women in his classes but there is the society of women engineers (SWE) and women in leadership roles of ASME (association of mechanical engineers?). It might even be better now, we graduated in 2018",

In my time working since then I've met people from other schools who had classes on useful, industry related topics that I had never even heard of due to Baylor's focus on future research.",

There are a slew of different ways to get involved with other engineers outside of class, and the professors here are awesome! I would echo what others here have said - get in touch with Baylor SWE, they're a great resource for female engineers.",

    "postText": "I got accepted from Baylor a week ago. Checked my financial aid section and saw that CSS Profile was showing the status Satisfied. In the Award Offer section of my BearWeb account, it shows Cost of Attendance, Housing Status amd Expected Enrollment Status, Net Cost. There is no aid written anywhere. Beneath it is the Submit button. What is the purpose of it and what am I submitting there?",

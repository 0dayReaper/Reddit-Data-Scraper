    "postText": "Hey I was just wondering how reasonable it is to do Pre-Med as an Engineer. I was thinking of doing ECE and trying to concentrate in Biomedical on the Pre-Med track. Does anybody know if this is totally unreasonable? I know it\u2019ll be harder to keep a high gpa for Med School, but I don\u2019t mind studying a ton since I love the subject.",

I have 11 AP credits that I\u2019m hoping will get me out of a lot of required Gen Eds. However, my advisor didn\u2019t make it seem like I was getting many.",

I\u2019d certainly recommend pursuing credit for your AP classes wherever possible to reduce the number of gen ed classes at Baylor\u2019s tuition rate. I unfortunately didn\u2019t have this option because I was also in BIC. \n\nThe standard engineering degree is set for (9) 15-16 credit semesters. It\u2019s my recollection that there are at least 4-6 science classes which pre-med requires that are not a part of the standard engineering degree. At least that was the case for me when I graduated with an ECE degree in \u201816.\n\nAsk your counselor for a list of the pre-med classes and compare it to the engineering degree roadmap. I\u2019ve always heard that medical schools will highly value an engineering undergrad degree with matching MCAT scores.",

I\u2019m going to try to talk to my advisor though about specifically doing a concentration in Biomedical so it can tie in better. I\u2019m hoping that I can shove some of my Pre-Med classes in the electives spot. I\u2019m really trying graduate in &lt;= 4 years lol. All of my scholarships only cover 4 years of undergrad so any longer than that and I\u2019ll end up paying full tuition which is FARRR from ideal.",

I saw some posts here from a couple months ago saying it was down, so idk if this is a periodic thing (especially with all the traffic it must be getting cause of registration opening up) or if it's just been down for months now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the meantime, anyone know of any alternative sites with a lot of BU profs? I checked Rate My Professors &amp; Uloop and barely any of the profs I'm looking up are even listed on em.",

I did it to reserve spots for comms classes and had a really tough time finding reviews for professors. Best luck I had was going to Rate My Professor and just word of mouth. Good luck with registration though!",

            "comment": "little known life hack: if bubooks is down and you need to access it urgently, google search the name of the prof you're looking for + bubooks and when the search results come up, click the three dots next to the link instead of the search result itself. A little box that says \"more options\" should pop up. Click the little drop down arrow and select \"cached\". It'll bring up a cached version of the page from the last time you visited the website (even if you've never visited that specific professor's page before). It's great in a pinch, but keep in mind that a review uploaded after the date you last accessed bubooks would not show up. Hope this helps :))",

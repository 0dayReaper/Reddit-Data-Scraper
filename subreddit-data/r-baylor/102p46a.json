            "comment": "submit on the earlier deadline! more chances at getting accepted due to the amount filled already and the more merit you could receive. also helps with admission to special programs like bic or honors which is also a filled slot basis. bic can only be added your first semester so in this case it is better to apply earlier as you have more advantages at your hand. it also may help you look more into each acceptance vs spending that time on a school you are unsure if you got into. for me, i chose baylor out of ten acceptances based on merit, bic and honors programs, academics, and social life that other schools didn\u2019t reciprocate. i also recommend making a spreadsheet and ranking schools based on this and your own criteria. there were other r1 schools on my list but due to the merit offered, i ended up choosing baylor instead!",

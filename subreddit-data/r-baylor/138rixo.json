If you\u2019re interested, get plugged in with Panhellenic right away and start trying to make friends in your classes with sorority girls. Most of them are happy to have a study date, tell you about their experience, etc. I chose mine because I made a good group of friends right away that were all in it, and I clicked well with a lot of the other members. \n\nEvery sorority has a different vibe and it\u2019s better to find a good fit rather than trying to just pick the most popular one.",

Don't join a group because it's popular. These women are meant to be your sisters for life. My sorority sisters were part of my wedding. One is godmother to my daughter. I chose my sorority because I genuinely loved the women I met.\n\nMy best advice is to figure out what's important to you. Do you value philanthropy work? Sisterhood events? Is performing at Pigskin your goal? While each sorority participates in these things, some are more important to them than others. Attend as many \"get to know you\" events as you can in the fall and make connections.\n\nIf you really like a particular group, reach out to an alumna for a letter of recommendation. It can help your chances if an alumna vouches for you.\n\nI'm happy to tell you more about Greek life (the good and the bad) and my personal experience at Baylor and now as part of an alumnae association.",

When I was a freshman I had no idea what I wanted to major in, I emailed him and he invited me to his office where we just talked about life and college and finance for 3 hours. For job opportunities, you\u2019re set in a lot of companies and if you get involved in different groups you can easily land a job in IB, consulting etc.",

However, I did learn a lot and used that knowledge to get good internships and eventually a very nice job. \n\nAny business majors/ prospective business majors feel free to DM to learn more about my experience as Id be happy to help out fellow bears.",

    "postText": "This post is for all applicants who are hearing back from Baylor about their decision:\n\nBoth Baylor\u2019s Class of 2024 and 2025 were incredibly high with the \u201825s being the highest of all. I think there were about 600-700 extra enrolled students in this year\u2019s freshman class. They are renovating Collins hall and Baylor is trying to get back to it\u2019s 30-40% acceptance rate or even lower to maintain/increase prestige. As a university, Baylor has reached R1 so it is expected that the number of applications would increase and so does the interest to attend. The admission office is very much trying to lower the rate of acceptance and unfortunately, they are going to reject applicants who or a perfect fit for Baylor. \n\nIf you really think you belong at Baylor and it is your calling, APPEAL. Baylor loves students who are showing consistent and heavy interest towards joining. If you appeal and still get rejected, don\u2019t take it too personally. You are all amazing people, however, given the limited number of spots rejections have to be given. You can always transfer to Baylor since the university is very generous with its transfer students. Just wanted to put this out there. Wishing the best of luck with your decisions and applications.",

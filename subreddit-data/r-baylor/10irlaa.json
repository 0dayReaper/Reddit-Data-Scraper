Id pick those if you want to be surrounded by others doing similar things as you. It\u2019s also helpful for classes, it\u2019ll be mostly freshman dw. Also consider whether you\u2019re looking to stay on campus sophomore year or not as there are 2 year commitment dorms.",

I also had friends stay in the cove style dorms in Teal, they were nice too. If possible, try to tour the dorms!

Obviously there were some who didn't find someone or isn't dating the same person from the dorms but compared to all other dorms over the years you gotta start assuming there's something magical about the place...even though it's kinda built like a prison.",

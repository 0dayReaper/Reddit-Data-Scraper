The offense was impressive, but I think the defense was more impressive. Georgia held TCU to under 200 yards of offense. I think TCU gave everything they had &amp; played very, very well to hang on against Michigan last week &amp; that showed tonight.",

I wanted a Texas team to win it.  I wanted a small private university to win it.  I wanted a Big 12 team to win it.   I wanted people to think that the Big 12 can compete with anybody.  I'm not sure why any of you didn't.\n\nWhat you all maybe don't realize is how terribly this bodes for Baylor, and how far Baylor is from the promised land.  If TCU and K-State failed that miserably against the SEC powerhouses, Baylor is nowhere even remotely close, even after last year's incredible season.\n\nI know TCU is our \"hated\" rival.  But we can put that aside and cheer for them when they're going up against these big college football \"brands\", these hundred-million-dollar machines that have every advantage known to man.  I don't want to see the rich get richer, see the gargantuan machine steamroll everything in its path.  I want to see the Alabamas, the Georgias, the Ohio States knocked off their pedestals.",

TCUs success has a negative and direct impact on the ability of Baylor to succeed for several reasons. \n\n1) we are both regionally oriented teams who compete for the same in state or regional 3 and 4 star recruits. Almost everyone we have offered has also been offered by TCU.  Having a Natty and stringing together great draft classes would hurt our ability to compete for the same recruits. The damage inflicted thus far this year was bad enough, we don\u2019t need them dangling the CFP trophy out there as a carrot. \n\n2) Realignment is coming\u2026a TCU team with a natty would have the option to split off and do it\u2019s own thing on the next shuffle. As it stands now, baylor and TCU would likely be a strong package deal. Baylor offers almost nothing from a TV viewership POV, so we may need that Fort Worth market to help us down the road. \n\n3) TCU managed to keep Baylor out of the CFP in 2021 when Bohanon threw that boneheaded INT at the end of the game. We failed to return the favor this year when TCU managed to knock down a walk-off on our home turf. For that alone I am glad they lost.",

You think UT rooted for OU when OU was in the playoffs? Auburn fans were livid seeing Georgia and Bama both in the CFP last year. I'm glad that a non-OUT team made it. Glad that A&amp;M had a dumpster fire of a season. If it was anyone in the Big XII (non-OUT) but TCU, I'd have cheered for them. But screw TCU! I'm glad Georgia took their souls. \n\nThanks for beating Michigan, though!",

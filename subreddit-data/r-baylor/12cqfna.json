Once you earn a certain number of hours, the rest all have to be taken at Baylor. At least that was the policy a few years ago. Your mileage may vary.",

He's fantastic and teaches some cool electives, like a course on Harry Potter (at least he did a decade ago). Looks like he's still teaching! Not too difficult, and despite my being a science-minded person I loved the Brit Lit class I took from him.",

He\u2019s the dude?\n\nMuch like European soccer supporters have a song for their favorite players, I\u2019ve got a suggestion for y\u2019all. \n\nStudent section, hear me out. Sing this to the tune of Shake It by Metro Station after a Shapen TD.\n\n\nNow if he does it like this, he will do you like that\nNow if he touches like this, he will touchdown like that\nNow if he moves like this, he will score like that. \nCome on, Shape shape shape, a-Shapen\nBlake Blake, Blake Blake, a-Shapen\nBlake Blake, Blake Blake, a-Shapen\nBlake Blake, Blake Blake, a-Shapen\n\nGive it a try. I\u2019d love to hear it on national TV this year.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am considering returning to Baylor to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (general with biomedical concentration) with music minor in 2025, two years from now. I was last enrolled at Baylor from August 2002-December 2004. I possess a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from the University of Texas at San Antonio (awarded in 2009); therefore, by law I am not eligible for a federal Pell Grant since that is only available to those seeking a first baccalaureate degree, nor am I eligible for a Texas Tuition Equalization Grant (TEG) under similar rules. However, I understand Baylor University offers its own institutional grants to those who need it, besides merit-based scholarships. \n\nFor those of you who have received an institutional grant, how much roughly did you receive per year? Was it enough to cover your cost of attendance?",

            "comment": "I had everything paid for but room and board, and I only paid for that for two and a half years. I ended up with fifty grand in student loans. I imagine that without a lot of the grants, the fact that more people are being denied funding, and that the cost has gone up 50% since I graduated, it might be financially worthwhile.",

Either way, it would be helpful to email either the admissions department or financial aid to better understand what funding is available to you. (It will be different than if you were a freshman or transfer student)",

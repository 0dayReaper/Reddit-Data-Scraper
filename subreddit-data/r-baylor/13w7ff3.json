When I come in town now though, I find parking downtown and take one of the free shuttles to the stadium. The lines get LONG for them, but they actually move at a decent pace. The shuttle ride itself is like 5 mins tops.\n\nEdit:I just realized you said WATER taxi, so my info probably doesn\u2019t help lol. You could try contacting [Outdoor Waco](https://outdoorwaco.wordpress.com/contact/) , they rent boats, so they might know who to contact about a \u201cwater taxi\u201d to the game.",

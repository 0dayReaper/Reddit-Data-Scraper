I\u2019ve heard plenty of good things and i\u2019m visiting soon but being from the northeast I\u2019m sure i\u2019m in for a different experience than what I\u2019ve grown up around. Anybody have tips/advice of what to expect and how campus is? Pretty excited to check it out!",

            "comment": "I don't know where you are coming from, so its hard to say what you might expect.\n\nThat said, Baylor is a small-ish community, in parts, with some overlap.  \n\nSocially, you've got the church / religious crowd, you've got the frat / sorority crowd (and the students participate at a higher rate than most other texas schools), you've got the serious student crowd, you've got VERY wealthy, you've got barely scrapping by; and mixes of all.\n\nThe class sizes are small, so you'll have a good bit of social diversity.  Overall, Baylor is very friendly, very small town-ish.  You will run into the same people often.\n\nClasses are demanding, but if you keep up with the work, you shouldn't have any issue.  You will NOT be a number.  \n\nYou don't have to be religious, but you will be asked OFTEN, especially freshman year to attend churches or bible studies.  Go if you want, politely decline if you don't want to.  Baylor is mostly conservative, white school, but there is a liberal crowd too.\n\nI loved my experience, I'd love to tell you yours will be great too, but who knows.  It is what you make of it.  My advice if you attend...get involved.  In whatever you are interested in.  There are so many organizations and groups, you shouldn't have any trouble finding some people with similar interests.",

            "comment": "I'm from Maryland, so slightly Northeast. Baylor is a wonderful University and I think the transition can be a bit difficult at times but overall is not too big of an issue and I am so glad to have come down to Waco anyways. As the other guys have mentioned, Waco/Baylor is probably a bit more open about matters of faith than what we probably grew up around. Being Christian I actually really appreciate this, but I have heard this can be difficult for non-Christians. Though many non-Christians do come to Baylor and love the eperience.\n\nI think the best part of coming from up north, however, is that people are just much friendlier in Waco. People are intentional about forming friendships and genuinely want to care for you. Southern hospitality is no lie. Also, country dancing is a thing and I'm so glad I \"learned\" how to do that; I'm still not great. \n\nIf you have any other more specific questions, feel free to let me know! I love talking about Baylor and how much I love it",

Parties, people fucking the shit out of each other, getting drunk as hell, and getting so high they discover a new color. Religion is only hinted at unless you are taking a religion class or seeking it out. There is a pretty good Christian population- some that actually practice the way and others that may \u201cidentify\u201d with it.\nThere are some more rules here than at other universities but it really doesn\u2019t change anything unless you are publicly representing the university like an athlete in a game, or whatever \n\nBasically- baylor is a school where if you are religious, there are more religious opportunities to take advantage of than a non religious school \nOther than that, it\u2019s like any place else\nPolitically, if you even care about that stuff, it\u2019s pretty liberal with a decent republican population but it really doesn\u2019t mean anything. Education, depends on professor but from my experience most are neutral but my education has made me lean more left I suppose but I personally stay out of all politics. Other people may read in this too much and think when I mean liberal it\u2019s like super far left or republican super far right. It not either. It\u2019s like a broad dose from each and doesn\u2019t effect daily life at all. Idk \nAnyways, baylor is like any other school socially so don\u2019t worry about it being religious or worrying it could potentially be super political because it\u2019s in texas",

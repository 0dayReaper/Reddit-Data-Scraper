    "postText": "Hello! ( sorry for format I\u2019m on mobile) \n\nSo like prob many of the people looking at this post, I unfortunately didn\u2019t get accepted into Baylor for the fall semester, but they offered me an opportunity to do Verto Bears. \n\nIt\u2019s supposedly partnering with Verto education that makes me able to finish my Gen Ed and then transfer in the spring. I\u2019m very wary about this, although wanting to travel and study abroad has always been a dream of mine. \n\nHas anyone been in this program before or has heard of it that has any reviews of the experience?? \n\nI don\u2019t wanna waste my money and I have a feeling Baylor is just pushing me aside to go do something else and then maybe I have a chance of attending in spring but it\u2019s not guaranteed. \n\nIf anyone has any advice I\u2019d appreciated it, be as brutal as you need.",

            "comment": "It's essentially delayed admission. You do the program, do well, and the 'transfer' is guaranteed.\n\nBut you need to ask yourself two questions.\n\nHow much do you want to go to Baylor? How do you plan on paying for Baylor?\n\nIf Baylor is your absolute dream school and you'd do anything to attend, the program is a way in. You won't have a traditional first semester experience, but you'll likely find friends within the Verto Bears program. Plus, there's always student organizations and plenty of other ways to make friends once you're on campus.\n\nAs a 'transfer' student, you'll have very little financial aid or scholarships from Baylor, so you'll need to figure out where the money is going to come from.",

That\u2019s what confused me because I felt like the verto bears was just a way to pull more money out of you.",

            "comment": "Super interesting idea - I did study abroad my junior year at Baylor at John Cabot in Rome and it was a huge highlight of my time in college. I don\u2019t know anything about this program BUT it sounds really cool and might actually be a huge opportunity especially if Baylor is where you want to go and this sets you up for second semester of your first year at Baylor after!\n\nThe only downside of doing abroad so soon would be missing your first semester on campus BUT I personally don\u2019t think that\u2019s a deal breaker - many of my best friends I met my second semester of Freshman year and years later\u2026 so I wouldn\u2019t shut the door on this idea.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m an elder millennial bear so graduated in Spring of 2009 so take my thoughts with a grain of late 30s salt.",

I think it really comes down to the person and the exact details, but I would recommend going somewhere else and doing college on your terms.\n\nEdit: Also the specific wording of \"transfer into Baylor\" doesn't sit right with me. It sounds like you might be about to shell out money for this with no guarantee of admission to Baylor since it's probably dependent on how many people drop out after the fall.",

I\u2019m thinking maybe I should just take a semester off and finish my undergrad and then transfer to a big college in spring straight away, that sounds best.

    "postText": "Freshman year: Most of you will be taking intro to Bio and Chem classes with the lab portion so here are some tips: \n\n1. Bio lab 1105-1106 are one of the most irrelevant labs although 1106 is cool due to C. Elegans, but 1105 (BU TREES is hell). Don\u2019t punch yourself to much if you don\u2019t do well in these 1 credit hour labs. They will be very insignificant when you are taking an 18 credit hour course load. \n\n2. Don\u2019t get too cocky if you ace these intro to Bio and Chem classes. The main weeder courses are the Organic Chemistry and physics sequences along with Biochemistry and genetics. Maintain good work ethic and you will be fine. \n\n3. Don\u2019t get too bogged down if you don\u2019t do well in these intro classes. College is difficult so you will live and learn. I\u2019ve had many friends get Cs in intro to Chem classes and ace orgo/biochem. Don\u2019t let one class take you down. \n\n4. Chem lab is literally the easiest lab ever so make sure you ace that. Dr. McGrath is one of the best lecturers so if you have a chance to take him, please do highly recommend. Prepared me well for upper level classes. \n\n5. Life ain\u2019t just about classes so step out of your comfort zone and explore both the Baylor experience and interests (join clubs, sports and etc). Know your limitations and values (don\u2019t let anyone else decide that). \n\nLooking forward to having the class of 2027 on campus this fall. Have a great summer (don\u2019t prepare ahead, just chill, explore interests or spend time with your loved ones, you won\u2019t get a break like this once you start).

Even been in their weddings. Doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t have friends in Penland, Martin, and all across campus. \n\nWhere you live and what you study while on campus doesn\u2019t make you any better or worse than any other Bear. Talking down to people and insulting what they do, where they live, or what they\u2019ve chosen to pursue as a life goal or career? That absolutely does make you worse.",

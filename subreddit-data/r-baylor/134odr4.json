    "postText": "Hello, all. It's nearing finals season, and I've been hit with an especially hard case of senioritis. I'm graduating in two weeks, and I've already been accepted into grad school. There is one class this semester where I've been struggling, and currently, I'm trying to see what the lowest possible grade in that class can be. I have had a rough semester in general, and I can explain my low grades in relation to that. If I get a C-, am I still able to graduate?",

My counselor literally said \"D is for degree\" and I thought it was the craziest thing to say to a student. Im not an expert though, and I did do college during covid, so the reqs might have been relaxed. Probably best to talk to a real counselor or whatever they are called. Easy email.",

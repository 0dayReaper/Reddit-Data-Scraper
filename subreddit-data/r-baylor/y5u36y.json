Jeff Grimes is one of those names.\n\nDo you like him? Do you like his offense/scheme? What does he do well?\n\nJust wondering!",

            "comment": "He's pretty good, yeah. He helped fix our offense last year after it was *terrible* in Aranda's first season.\n\nHis big thing is wide zone run schemes, which basically means that instead of blocking outwards from a specific hole, the o-line blocks sideways and the running back runs horizontally until a hole appears, then does a plant-and-go. The pass game seems to be pretty standard modern pass concepts with a lot of play action.\n\nHe's a stellar o-line coach; we've gone from one of the worst in the conference to one of the best under him, and I think that was his position coaching role before becoming our OC.\n\nWhat I've also liked about him is how he's adapted his playcalling to who is on the field instead of forcing next-man-up to a system too tightly.\n\nJumping all the way to head coach would be a pretty meteoric rise, but he has the tactical acumen to do so. I would prefer to keep him and would lie to you if it helps do so, but somehow I don't think the Auburn OC is reading my reddit comments so... enjoy lol.\n\nThat said, beware that Baylor has a metric fuckton of money dedicated to coaching salaries now, and it's not as easy to pry a coach away from here as it used to be. Auburn easily has the funds to do it if they decide that's the best option, but it would likely require substantial investment--and therefore substantial *confidence* from the money-givers.",

Grimes has never hidden that last year\u2019s offense was a stepping stone to a more pass-oriented offense like he ran at BYU, and he and his offensive assistants were very open in the offseason about their excitement about opening up the passing game this year. They made the decision relatively early in spring camp to switch to Shapen this year over staying with Bohanon, which was a very decisive shift toward the passing QB over the rushing QB, which locked us into that schematic pivot, but this season has made it very clear that our WR corps isn\u2019t where it needs to be to support this heavy of a shift to the passing game. All but one of our starting WRs are underclassmen, and Gavin Holmes singlehandedly lost the OKST game with all of his drops, not to mention his genuinely swinging a catch into an interception at the goal line. Tyquan Thornton *was* our downfield passing game last year, and now he\u2019s with the Patriots.\n\nOur WR corps could\u2019ve benefitted immensely from another year of gradual progression toward the passing game, and our entirely returned OL could\u2019ve made that happen, but instead Grimes and co. wanted to get over to a passing offense that would theoretically be more explosive, and didn\u2019t take into consideration that our WR personnel couldn\u2019t currently support that. Now we\u2019ve spent the last four games backtracking and trying to do more of what we did last year, but Shapen\u2019s not the terrifically physical rusher that Bohanon was, and our RBs are all young as well.\n\nThe OL can keep Shapen in a clean pocket all day long, but the WRs aren\u2019t getting separation like they\u2019d need to for Grimes\u2019 ideal offense to work like it did at BYU, and then when they do get separation, they\u2019re dropping balls relatively often. They\u2019re young, so that\u2019ll change over time as they develop, but they\u2019re not there yet. Our only very strong offensive performances so far have been against a bad G5 team, a bad FCS team, and WVU, who has a really bad defensive secondary. OKST shut us the hell down for three quarters, and BYU clamped down so hard in the passing game that we basically gave up passing in the second half and tried to run last year\u2019s scheme with a RS FR at RB, trying to do what Abram Smith did as a senior.\n\nThis is explicitly a case of pushing toward a scheme that our personnel can\u2019t currently support, rather than making a gradual shift based on strengths of the players that we actually have.",

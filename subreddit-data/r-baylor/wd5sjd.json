A lot of times you\u2019ll get sick of sugary junk food/dining hall food and need something plain and healthier. \n\nSomeone else suggested a rice cooker, which I think is super smart if you like rice. Easy zero-effort meals. I had a tiny single serving one that served me well. \n\nI survived off of trail mix one year. It\u2019s fairly high sugar though. \n\nProtein powder can be a good move as well. I like completely unflavored stuff because a lot of the sweeteners make me sick. \n\nI also always kept a big tub of Greek yoghurt in my fridge and some jam/honey. You can mix it together to get a flavor/level of sweetness you like. Plus it wastes less plastic than single-serve. \n\nEggs, bread, cheddar cheese, and oil plus a frying pan. Fried egg sandwiches were a staple for me. \n\nAnd a little reusable grocery bag to tote things back and forth from the kitchen. \n\nIt partially depends on how much you want to/are willing to cook. I like to cook so I always kept more ingredients around than complete meals. If you don\u2019t like to cook, look into TV dinners, prepared snacks, frozen burritos, hot pockets, things like that. You can also meal prep. I still make huge batches of beef and beans, and make a bunch of burritos out of them. Wrap in plastic wrap and freeze. Microwave in plastic when you need. They keep for maybe 4-6 months and are super handy. \n\nBest of luck to you!\n\nEdit: also some high fiber cereal. It\u2019s important to stay regular haha. I like oatmeal squares.",

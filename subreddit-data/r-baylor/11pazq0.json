Is their program as well-known or maybe competitive as, say, Texas A&amp;M, UT Austin, or Texas Tech? Probably not, but you\u2019ll be fine. The alum network will keep most all graduates hired right out of the program as long as their grades reflect their abilities.",

            "comment": "It was still growing when I was there, but the education was fine. Dr. Jack, while an enthusiastic professor, made tests harder than they needed to be on purpose, and I had a professor in a pretty dumb entrepreneur class who didn't give out A's because there was \"always room for improvement.\" The professor I hated retired the year I graduated, and a professor I really liked left to go teach at Texas A&amp;M if I recall correctly.\n\nIt felt like most of the professors had never actually had a real job and thought academia ruled the world.\n\n10+ years out, here's what I've learned: Harder classes do not translate to more money in the professional world. There are easier ways to become an engineer, and they may even actually lead to more money in the professional world. Pursue those avenues if they are available.",

I have had a 4.0 uw all through hs, and I\u2019ve taken 6 out of 8 APs offered. I have a 33 superscore on my act, 32 composite. How much merit do you think I would get? Thanks.",

            "comment": "I had comparable stats, but there are additional considerations for scholarships, like writing skill, program, and extracurriculars. Overall, I got 75% of my Baylor costs (including room and board) paid for.\n\nBut that still ended up being about $50k. I took out the maximum public loan and additional private loans, which are currently on freeze. The private loans cost me just under $500 a month, and I still owe them about $17k. Unless my degree suddenly becomes worth a lot more money, I am probably going to be paying this off for at least another decade.\n\nAll that to say: See what offer Baylor gives you. Then you need to decide for yourself if potentially paying that off for the next two decades is worth it. It might be for you! But that's not something I'm qualified to help with here.",

My parents couldn't pay for anything, but that doesn't stop the university from claiming they can pay half of their salary to help you.\n\nAlso keep in mind that I got more scholarships as I went along. The first year my package was probably only covering 60%, but the longer I kept up my GPA, participated in my honors and major's programs, and added value to campus life by leading and forming clubs, the more I got. I also graduated early which certainly helped. I think my last year was 80% scholarships and I took out a tiny loan my senior semester to just cover the costs of flying back from Europe and then moving my stuff back home after I graduated.",

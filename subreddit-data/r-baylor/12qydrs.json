            "comment": "Hiya,\n\n\\- Some background: I am a Ph.D. student in a stem (physiology) field at Baylor (have my M.S. in Physiology and B.S. in Exercise Physiology/Biology.\n\nThis is a throwaway account, however, I can provide some insight into what it is like to be a science student at many universities and what I have found over the years.\n\nFirst, I think it is a common misconception that they intentionally make the courses hard in the first-year courses (weed-out courses). Instead, I think it is best to think of them as an introduction to the rigor that science requires. The reason why STEM is so different than other majors is the mobility of conceptualization it requires, rather than the amount that you can memorize (this is still important, just not the foundation). Anyone is welcome to disagree with me on my synopsis of STEM, however, I have found that while I work with my students, or instruct those who are not familiar with the studying habits, ways to move through content, or overall \\*intensity, e.g. requirements\\* of certain courses -their hardships are mostly due to their studying habits. You won't love every class, I know I didn't, but the ability to overcome those things that you perceive as difficult and build your knowledge base as you move through STEM is something that only ever help you in life.\n\nStudying science can definitely be challenging in many ways, but with the right approach, you can learn and understand any complex concept and have it be extremely rewarding.\n\nHere are the tips that I share with all of my undergraduate and master's students:\n\n**Understand the basics**: Science builds on fundamental principles, so it's important to have a solid foundation. Make sure you understand basic concepts and terminology before moving on to more advanced topics.\n\n**Read actively**: Don't just passively read your textbook or notes. Highlight or underline important information, ask questions, and take notes as you go. This will help you stay engaged and retain more information.\n\n**Practice problem-solving: Science often involves solving problems and applying concepts to real-world situations. While working through your notes, make sure you ask yourself, \"What kind of question can come from this work/slide, what about this is important, and why did they put it on the slide?\"**\n\n**Use visual aids:** Science often involves complex diagrams, charts, and graphs. However, these are to your advantage as a graph/picture can say 1000 words.\n\n**Collaborate with others**: Studying with others can be helpful, as you can bounce ideas off each other and learn from different perspectives and make sure you review regularly to reinforce what you are learning. Also, try to teach others. This will highlight what you do and do not have a grasp of. If you feel like you are avoiding a certain topic, that is where you should start!\n\nRemember, studying science takes time and effort, but all professors and students want you to succeed!",

All of undergrad I was a very passive studier and it was a slog, during my master's I started pausing after every textbook page and would try to explain what I had read out loud without looking at the book. I would pace around and try to explain as much of each chapter from memory as if I was giving a lecture, and I immediately started retaining so much more information and studying became much more effective and by extension biology as a whole suddenly became far more interesting and new ideas became much easier to learn.",

Not sure if it\u2019s still this way, but one of the freshman labs was not really a lab but more like a separate class that required substantial study. O chem is also something that many people have trouble with.\n\nMany Freshman have a hard time adjusting to college. The class material is harder and there is much more independent study required. \nCollege is hard work. Many majors are hard. You have to be dedicated. If you aren\u2019t interested in meeting the challenge, Biology isn\u2019t for you.",

            "comment": "Biology is not an easy or a fun major. The typical weed out course is O-Chem. Professors do not want you to fail. It is that students do not put in the effort because it requires a huge effort. \n\nOne thing you should appreciate is that once you get to campus, you are no longer the smartest kid. Your peers are as smart or smarter. The classes aren\u2019t necessarily \u201charder.\u201d You are now just on a level playing field. \n\nI somehow graduated with my biology degree. And I\u2019m now a lawyer that focuses on toxic torts (so I actually deal with science). If anything, the greatest benefit from science degrees is the ability to objectively analyze most problems. \n\nAnd finally, this is college. You can start as a biology major- or go in undecided and take the typical pre reqs - and then decide if it is the correct choice for you.",

            "comment": "   There are many narrow gates in college. Many people don't graduate. Some classes have low pass rates.  A big part of being successful is college is knowing that failure is possible but working hard enough that you don't fail. It is absolutely possible to graduate with an degree in Biology, Baylor graduates a ton of them every year. You just have to be dedicated enough to do it.  \n\n\n  One of the biggest things that improved my grades in college was a mindset shift. If 50% of the class failed, I did not care. I was going to work harder than anyone else and take care of business. I would encourage you to change your thinking. Don't think about how many fail freshman bio, it isn't important. There are plenty of As and Bs available. You have the opportunity to study and secure one of those for yourself.",

It's not easy but if you're willing to put in the work you'll be okay, make sure you start studying for exams a week out for your science classes, and try to get easy professors. I didn't think there were any weed out classes, though a lot of freshmen come into bio not realizing it takes effort to succeed and so they drop.",

Baylor went into Jones AT&amp;T Stadium and took on a pumped up Texas Tech team that had not lost on their home turf all season long, during a blackout game, after several weak performances. And damn if they didn't have their best game of the season so far. This team still has some fight in them, and it was lots of fun to watch! I'm sure it was a bit spooky for the Red Raiders with Halloween coming up, but it was all treats for the Bears!\n\n* **Biggest Disappointment:** The Bears didn't leave too much to complain about tonight, but they did give me a bit of a fright as the 3rd quarter drew to a close. A couple of mental mistakes and some blown defensive coverages led to Tech closing the gap to a mere 7 points, and it felt a heck of a lot like some of our previous games this season. I was mentally preparing myself for another disappointment, but tonight the Bears adjusted and came through.\t\n\n* **Player of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* You know, I really try to spread this award out among different players. But Richard Reese keeps having games that far outshine anyone else on the field. Tonight his stat line was incredible, with 36 carries for 148 yards, 3 TDs, and responsible for several cases of PBTS (Post-Baylor Trauma Syndrome). The man is a rushing machine.\n * *Defense:* Devin Lemear was on the Tech Offense like a Bear on honey. With 4 solo tackles, an INT, a break-up and another *barely* missed INT, he was an absolute menace to all three quarterbacks Tech threw at him. Have a game, Devin!\n\n* **Play of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* Hard choice on this one today, but I have to give it to Hal Presley's 9 yd TD reception early in the 3rd quarter. It put Baylor up by 17, and really took the wind out of the sails of the Red Raider crowd, which is always important on the road. But more than that, it looked like it gave Shapen a little more confidence in his ability to deliver a TD with his arm, which he struggled with at times tonight. \n * *Defense:* If it was a struggle to choose the offensive play, this one was so easy it makes up for it. Hard to ignore a pick six! Late in the 4th, with Tech trying everything in the book to get back in the game, they sent out Tyler Shough for the first time since being injured in the opening game of the season. Unfortunately for Shough, his first play would be an INT to AJ McCarty who returned it 18 yards for a TD, sealing the game for the Bears.\n\n\n* **What We Learned:** You never know what version of this team will show up. They could be the team that shoots themselves in the foot so hard they lose to WVU, or they could be the team that intercepts the Red Raiders 5 times and recovers an additional fumble on the way to a 28-point shellacking. When the Bears come to play, they play. Now we just need to find a way to show up reliably. The rest of the season is a real gauntlet, and we're going to need to play our absolute best game every week if we want to make something out of the season at this point.\n\n* **Next Week:** Baylor continues their road trip north. They'll pay a visit to a stumbling Oklahoma Sooners team in Norman as they look to become bowl eligible.\n\n* **Weekly Pickem Winner:** This week\u2019s pickem winner is /u/poolplyr27, with a prediction of [Baylor, 49-21](https://www.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/yf51oh/102922_football_pickem_spooky_torilla_edition_32/iu5emm1/) Enjoy your gold and spiffy flair!\n\n---\n\n*Have anything to add?

Imagine how ridiculous it was for Shapen to slide down in front of the first down marker on the first offensive drive. Those kinds of mistakes shouldn't be happening at this point.",

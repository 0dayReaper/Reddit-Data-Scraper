It's how I got the job, and how I got a few other folks a job after I left.\n\nSo, it's not helpful advice, but yeah, knowing someone helps!",

This is because a lot of work study jobs hire in the spring/summer and thus don\u2019t have many openings by the time you arrive in the fall. I disagree with the comment saying you need to know someone. I\u2019m an out of state first generation student and didn\u2019t have any friends until after I started my job lol. Keep trying, but don\u2019t expect to get much until after winter break.",

I ended up with the degree in my flair but took a bunch of journo classes and ended up getting a great career-starting job at an international newspaper in DC. Best of luck to you, if you have any questions I'd be happy to assist.",

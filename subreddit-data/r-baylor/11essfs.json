    "postText": "I was recently offered admission to Baylor's biology PhD program, and am interested in hearing from  current or past graduate students in the biology department. I would like to know more about both workload and general graduate school culture. My questions are basically as follows:\n\n1. How heavy is the schedule for a PhD student with a graduate assistantship over the full course of the degree? I expect to work hard, but might have a difficult time doing 60 hours per week or more. Is it reasonable to expect the total workload to be akin to a full time job, or is that not standard? (I realize a lot of this boils down to your individual lab and professor, but is there a norm, or maybe a set of steps you can take to make sure things will be manageable?)\n\n2. How supportive is the faculty and the department in general? From my interviews it appears they truly want students to succeed, and are invested in this. Is this the case?\n\n3. Is there anything else I should be aware of about Baylor? It might be important to note that I will be bringing family with me.\n\nI would really appreciate any information you might be able to provide. Thank you!",

            "comment": "If you have a wireless problem somewhere on campus with Airbear, then please call the Help Desk (254-710-HELP) and put in a ticket so I can get my eyes on it. Most problems on the network are generally resolved within 15 minutes of me seeing them, as they typically just involve some routine maintenance on the system or a more localized solution. Unfortunately, I need more precise information about your trouble and what you're seeing in order to do anything meaningful about it (information such as what location, what error, username, and a wireless MAC address if possible). \n\nWireless operations are, however, subject to environmental interference and client maintenance. If you're sitting in the middle of a crowd of people all trying to use wireless at the same time, you won't get as much bandwidth on the network as you would if you were alone. You also won't get very much bandwidth if you're in a strange location, at the edge of coverage, or your wireless drivers are out of date (generally if you have problems all over campus, it's because the wireless drivers are out of date or the adapter is on death's door). In any case, I'm happy to help folks get connected and address problems as they pop up. \n\nFor a little behind-the-scenes, Airbear as a network has over 2500 access points and a large fiber optic and routing distribution that serves as the backhaul to the internet. I am on Airbear myself at all hours of the day, so if something goes sideways, I'm generally on it before it even gets to the Help Desk. That said, I can't be everywhere at once, so I do rely on users to report issues they see in order to resolve them. I have tried to set up some automated maintenance, but it doesn't work as well as I'd hope. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",

I appreciate Airbear a lot more now that I have my own crappy Internet to deal with. Wish I\u2019d gotten to meet you when I was still a student!",

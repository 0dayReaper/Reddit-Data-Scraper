If you have a specific interest in hardware (and plan on going to grad school), ECE can lead to some killer jobs at places like Intel, Qualcomm, Samsung, Apple, but you\u2019ll mostly be a hardware engineer.",

I love doing the same, but I don\u2019t have a strong interest in the engineering aspect of computer hardware. CE is more about the design of chips and other low-level \u201cparts\u201d and their manufacture. More physics and engineering heavy. Not saying you can\u2019t do that, as plenty students graduate every year across the planet with Computer Engineering degrees; just be sure that\u2019s the level you want to work at the rest of your life!",

The School of Engineering and Computer Science is a great place to be! Know that switching majors is also an option, so the decision you make is not absolutely permanent.",

I\u2019ve worked with plenty of EE\u2019s writing high level software and doing nothing with hardware, while I (a CS major) spent most of my career writing embedded firmware. If you\u2019re smart and work hard you can learn whatever you need to get the job you want with either major. Your compensation also depends more on your negotiating skills than it does on your major. You can even switch to the other field for your graduate degree if needed. Just talk to graduate admissions early if your thinking about that. You have a lot more flexibility than you might realize.\r  \n\r  \nThat said, it is important for you to discover what you enjoy doing and let that dictate which one you choose. You could spend some time researching the courses required for each program or even try both. Pick one as your major and the other as your minor. If you look at the degree plan flow charts, there\u2019s quite a bit of overlap the first 3 semesters so you should be able to switch majors easily and you can always drop the minor if you discover it\u2019s not for you.  \r  \n\r  \nYou\u2019ll be assigned an advisor to help you schedule your courses and they might be able to offer better advice on how to try both and make sure you still graduate on time. One thing that helped me was to take a lot of electives at a community college during the summer and transfer the credits over. This let me pack my schedule with the \u201cgood\u201d stuff. I was able to take quite a few more math and CS courses this way.\r  \n\r  \nHope this helps. They\u2019re tough majors, but well worth it and a lot of fun!",

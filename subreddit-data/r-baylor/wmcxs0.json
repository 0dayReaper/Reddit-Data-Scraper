Then tons of relationships end when they can\u2019t reconcile beliefs about abstinence.

But you asked, so here goes.\n\nI was the first non-conservative person a lot of people had met. In their minds, liberals (which is not a term I would use for myself now) were crazy people. I was constantly accidentally converting people away from their beliefs because I would point out some way that their very shallow worldview fell apart, and that resulted in a lot of people disliking me. It's fine to dislike me; there are a lot of good reasons to dislike me. But the fact that my existence challenges your worldview probably shouldn't be one of them.\n\nI was also the first even vaguely Jewish person most people had met. I was at that time praying about converting and considered myself to be an interfaith Christian and Jew (something I now recognize is not really possible from a properly Jewish perspective). I would wear my kippah around campus on holy days, and I received a lot of antisemitic hate in my direction. \n\nWhen I dated a Black woman, we got a ton of odd looks. The assumption at Baylor is that Black students are all student-athletes, and student-athletes' apartments are literally separated (segregated) from the rest of the campus. The fact that I was dating a Black woman led to all sorts of comments, assumptions, and some really vile racism.\n\nNone of that gets into the way Baylor essentially blamed student-athletes (a nice Baylor code for Black students) for the huge rape issue on campus, when the vast majority of rapes were and are committed by people involved in the majority white Greek life on campus.\n\nThat epidemic is made worse by the fact that Baylor's policy that \"you are a container\" of alcohol means you don't have a safe place to retire if you live on campus and chose to drink. It's not as if drinking is not happening on campus or just off of campus, and those rules only make the situation something administration doesn't have to deal with rather than taking proactive steps to protect Baylor students.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on realizing you're queer there.\n\nThere are a lot of things I love about Baylor. I could write similar paragraphs about the religion department, Boho, the honors college, and everything Baylor had to teach me. But unfortunately, a lot of those lessons were in how *not* to build community. Only when Baylor deals seriously with the racism, sexism, homophobia, and fear of engaging with people who are different would I ever consider sending my kid there.",

That distinction is important to realizing that you'll find a lot of solidarity even with Christians who don't share that background or priorities. But you can also build relationships with people who do represent that kind of Christianity when you realize that you do actually share some values with them and emphasize those values in those relationships.\n\nMore importantly though, clubs helped me a lot. I ended up becoming the president of the Baylor Dems, and that connected me with pretty much everyone who didn't fit into that very particular Baylor bubble. Find the people who keep you same and stick with them.",

Up in Fort Worth, just off TCU\u2019s campus feels like a college is meant to be there. \n\nWaco doesn\u2019t have any of that. We are bound by a triangle of borders (I35, the river, and La Salle, which runs into 35 to complete the triangle.) Inside this triangle is 2 things: campus and housing. Essentially no commercial life that is fun for students. It has no life. It feels dead. Outside of this triangle is more or less strictly locals. College towns, especially in the immediate vaccinate of campus, should be energetic and exciting. \n\nSure you can call Waco a college town because it is a town that is based around a college, but by no means does it have the feel of a college town.",

Secondly, if I was to use your \u201cbubble\u201d, you are stating Scruffs, Dancing Bear Pub, Shortys, Freight Icehouse &amp; Yardbar, Viteks, Health Camp, Common Grounds, etc are not \u201cfun things to do\u201d for college students.\n\n I included downtown Waco that has an entire assortment of college centered bars/shops that would not have stayed in business for years without the Baylor Students.  So all of the bars and restaurants on Austin Ave and Franklin that are all easy walking distance for a crawl.\n\nOr Amelia\u2019s, Cafe Cappuccino, Lolita's, or 1424 are all places where Baylor students are 50% of the people dining in the restaurant and they are all on the \u201cother side\u201d of 35.\n\nHaha, I\u2019m not trying to be a Homer about this, I spent many a weekend in College Station, Baton Rouge, and Clemson. Baylor is a Smaller university, but still had the same feel and activities.",

If you're going to become a professor at Baylor apparently you need to provide church references and not attending is a deal breaker. \n\nKnowing the school actively chose to potentially provide me with a less than optimal education just to ensure my calculus teacher doesn't believe in Allah seems...not ideal. \n\nI'm not a fan of that sort of staffing, imo a diverse group usually produces high quality knowledge bases with a wider variety of specialties.",

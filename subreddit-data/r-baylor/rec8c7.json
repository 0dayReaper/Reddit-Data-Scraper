Can anyone give any insight on the program and/or how they feel about it compared to the other majors within the business school?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnything helps. Thank you!",

            "comment": "Hi! I graduated from Business Fellows. It\u2019s a program designed to allow more flexibility, particularly outside the business school. There\u2019s a requirement about reaching fourth semester level of a science, math of language. \n\nI\u2019ve heard there\u2019s also a newer business honors program that is similar- so that might be worth looking into if you\u2019re mostly interested in business and less into arts &amp; sciences!",

            "comment": "If you want to do business + explore something outside of the business school fellows is the best way to do it. A lot of flexibility and provides the ability to major/minor in a lot of different things. IMO only worth it if you want to do a bunch of majors / do stuff outside the business school. \n\nAs a sophomore I don\u2019t know that it would be worth it / don\u2019t even know if fellows accepts sophomores. One of the main benefits of fellows is not having to do a decent amount of the entry level course requirements and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already taken all of those as a sophomore. Along with this, I think you need 60 hours outside of the b school so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s attainable at this point. \n\nLike the other commenter said Baylor just started another business program - Hankamer Scholars. This one is geared more towards students who are just interested in business. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll accept sophomores though because the program was just started this year. \n\nFeel free to pm me if you have any questions",

It's been several years since I was at Baylor, so they may have changed how it works.\n\nI'd add accounting and MIS are going to be a very hard double. I was an MIS grad and everyone I knew that attempted this ended up picking one or the other by the end. MIS is one of the most project intensive majors, so it becomes very time consuming (not difficult just a time sink). For the most part the most common double major with MIS was SCM or marketing.",

            "comment": "First 70% or so is Algebra II(or prereqs) and last 30% is pre-calc/trig. I'd go to Khan Academy and try sample questions of Algebra II and prioritize learning any concepts of questions I missed. Then, do the same for pre-calc if you have time. Should take a solid weekend of studying or around 20 hours, but could likely save you lots of money in avoiding all those credit hours of early math.\n\nRelated note, sample math ALEKS tests can be found through Google. You'll find the test tends to ask questions that aren't too difficult, but encompass a lot of different topics.",

    "postText": "The Bears have had two weeks to review the tape, make the adjustments, and develop the game plan needed to rebound after a disappointing showing against Oklahoma State. This week, they'll travel to Morgantown, Virginia (of the West Variety) to take on the Mountaineers. The 'Eers also haven't had the best start to their season, but they'll be looking to make a statement with a win over Baylor. So I ask you:\n\n# Who wins?\n\n## Game Odds\n\n| Opening | Current | Over/Under |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| Baylor -3.5 | Baylor -3.5 | 55 |\n\n*Odds are current as of the submission of this post.* [*^(sourced from OddsShark)*](https://www.oddsshark.com/ncaaf/baylor-west-virginia-odds-october-13-2022-1635516)\n\n## Game Info\n\n| Location | Opponent | Game Start |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| Milan Puskar Stadium - Morgantown, WV | West Virginia Mountaineers (2-3, 0-2 Big 12) | 10.13.2022, 6:00 PM CDT |\n\n## Previous Matchup\n\n| 10.09.2021 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Final | \n|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| **WVU** | 7 | 3 | 3 | 7 | **20** |\n| **BAY** | 21 | 7 | 14 | 3 | **45** |\n\n##Injuries \n\n## Baylor\n\n| Player | Position | Injury | Status |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| Taye McWilliams | RB | Undisclosed | Questionable |\n\n## West Virginia\n\n| Player | Position | Injury | Status |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| CJ Donaldson | TE | Concussion | Out Thurs |\n| Charles Woods | CB | Ankle | Out Indefinitely |\n\n## 2022 WINNERS\n\n| Game | Username | Prediction | Result |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| vs. Albany | /u/gir6543 | [Baylor, 70-9](https://old.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/x1q999/football_pickem_2022_season_opener_edition_4/img1m4s/) | Baylor, 69-10 |\n| @ BYU | N/A | N/A | BYU, 26-20 |\n| vs. Texas State | /u/FriskyHippoSlayer | [Baylor, 42-10](https://www.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/xf0l1x/football_pickem_cupcake_round2_edition_17_baylor/iojr510/) | Baylor, 42-7 |\n| vs. Texas State | /u/chowsey1 | [Baylor, 45-10](https://www.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/xf0l1x/football_pickem_cupcake_round2_edition_17_baylor/iojz1sj/) | Baylor, 42-7 |\n| @ Iowa State | /u/NawtAGoodNinja | [Baylor, 31-24](https://www.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/xlbe7g/football_pickem_clones_or_clowns_edition_%C2%B9%E2%81%B7/ipim5te/) | Baylor, 31-24 |\n| vs. OK State | /u/FriskyHippoSlayer | [Oklahoma State, 31-28](https://www.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/xqln5a/football_pickem_home_opener_edition_%E2%81%B9_oklahoma/iqa0h1l/) | Oklahoma State, 36-25 |\n\n\n# RULES\n\n1. **Predictions must be submitted by 2 hours before kickoff (4:00 PM CDT) on game day!** After this time, the thread will be locked.\n2. **Predictions must clearly state the predicted winner and specific score.** If no one predicts the correct winner, no one will win, and we will choose two winners next week.\n3. **All top-tier comments should be predictions.** Discussion can take place as replies to other predictions.\n4. **Edited posts will be disqualified and removed.** If you need to clarify your prediction, you can reply to your original comment. Otherwise, please delete and resubmit your prediction.\n5. **Flair up!** To be eligible to win the pickem, you need flair! You can request flair [in the official flair thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/pgnffl/user_flair_request_thread_fall_2021/?) located in the sidebar. If you didn't graduate from Baylor, but you're a Baylor fan, just request \"Baylor Fan\" or \"Sic 'em Bears\"! If you're a fan of another team, you can request the mascot of your team, such as \"Longhorns\" or \"Sooners\".\n\nThe prediction that correctly chooses the winner, comes closest to guessing the actual score and was submitted earliest will win. The prize for winning is a free month of Reddit Premium (and spiffy flair)! Good luck! Pick 'em, Bears!",

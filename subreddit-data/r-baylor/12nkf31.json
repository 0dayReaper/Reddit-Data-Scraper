    "postText": "Everyone I've spoken with said to take Lahousse, but I'm going to be incredibly busy in the fall and wanted to complete something difficult over summer since I wouldn't be doing anything else. I've heard that Jonklaas is extremely difficult and getting an A is nearly impossible so I was wondering if anyone had any experiences that suggest otherwise. I've also heard that all his exams are online yet students are collectively doing poorly (not that I would, but you're telling me people can't even pass by cheating\ud83d\ude2d??) which makes me even more anxious to take his class. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you.",

First of all, if you take biochem over the summer, I doubt you will learn or retain anything due to the pacing of summer classes and the complexity of the content. This will make it even more difficult to pass and you may wish to maintain a high GPA for grad school admissions. It's already a difficult class and now you will add insult to injury by rushing through it...\n\nI once attempted to take o chem, which is possibly easier than biochem, over the summer. I changed my mind.",

Don\u2019t kid yourself though: how diligent are you really? Do you have the academic curiosity and tenacity to learn the material at 2x speed? Do you hate summer that much?",

I, too, was in the position of essentially cramming many upper-level courses into a short period of time and so I know the stress that it can add. I had many sleepless nights and often wrote two or three full lab reports each week on top of other coursework, etc... What a crazy time that was!\n\n If you can avoid that, have your summer needs met, and have the luxury of focusing your time and energy on that class alone - it may be worth your while to try it out. Go for it - especially since you will have further opportunities to develop your understanding in the fall.",

As for the incredible Jonk, I'm hoping that biochem is just biochem and if you're disciplined enough to learn/memorize every molecule and mechanism under the sun, a notoriously difficult professor shouldn't stop you from getting an A.",

This is not to discourage and especially after reading your other comments on this thread, you can definitely do well with a lot of dedication, but what\u2019s important is how well you can retain the information. Biochem is a huge component on the MCAT and it\u2019s really important to take your time understanding the material. If you are planning to apply next cycle, it would be best to spend your summer doing other things because 1) Med school admission isn\u2019t exclusive to MCAT or the GPA, 2) for the 5K you spend on taking biochem over the summer can be used to take a prep class for the MCAT. That\u2019s just my two cents. Good luck with whatever you decide to do.",

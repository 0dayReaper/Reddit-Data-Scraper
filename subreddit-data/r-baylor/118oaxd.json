I don't really wanna go into that much student debt.\n\nAre there any options for me? I would consider an ROTC scholarship, but I believe those are closed by now. I don't really know if I'd get a merit-based scholarship (UW GPA of 3.8, SAT 1280).",

You have decent scores but it\u2019s too late to apply for the 2023-2024 school year (at least for Navy and Air Force). You can always walk on, and get a scholarship later. A&amp;M has a corps so you have to join the corps to do rotc. Almost everyone at baylor receives merit scholarships however it\u2019s not enough to pay for the entire year. Baylor is a great school, but if you see yourself elsewhere, I\u2019d definitely would go there and not baylor. I wish you the best of luck and that you are accepted into TAMU!",

Doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t get one anymore, but just for now, he\u2019d have to pay outta pocket.",

The money (unfortunately) should make the decision. Don't take on more debt than you're willing to, being realistic about paying it back and looking at the possibility of entering the workforce at a downturn in the economy. \n\nIn my case, CU provided a good education but larger class sizes. Be prepared to be a little fish in a big ocean if you can't/don't go to Baylor. If I had to do it over I probably would've just started on the cheap end! I do value the education Baylor provided, though. I went from Southern Baptist to hard Left. Some interesting perspectives, for sure. \n\nHigher education is a racket these days, indeed.",

Proud of those guys, they've worked so hard &amp; had success &amp; its nice to see them get rewarded with this, even if it is in a COVID year.   \n\n\nThey looked better against WVU, I hope the continue to round back into form as we approach the Big XII Tourney &amp; more importantly March Madness.",

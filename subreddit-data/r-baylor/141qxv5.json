    "postText": "Daniel Savala was arrested on June 2, 2023, and charged with continuous sexual abuse of a young child. His arrest comes two weeks after a former chapter leader at Baylor University\u2014Chris Hundl\u2014was charged for bringing two boys to Savala\u2019s sauna to masturbate in 2021 and 2022. And at least 13 men reported that Savala molested or raped them while they sought his spiritual advice as college students.\n\nOn April 17, 2023, Scheef &amp; Stone, LLP law firm sent a demand to the Texas A&amp;M University System, Texas State University System, the University of Houston System, Rice University and the University of Texas System alleging further abuses by Savala and demanding that action be taken to limit Chi Alpha Ministries organizations on campuses. In the demand letter, Scheef &amp; Stone allege Savala is closely tied to various Chi Alpha chapters, using his position to reach and take advantage of students.\u00a0\n\nOne of Gideon\u2019s attorneys, Mitchell Little, was present in the interview and was able to expand on the letter itself.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very pleased that Texas A&amp;M University, the Office of the General Counsel responded to us very quickly and seems to be giving the issue the attention that it's due, so I\u2019ve been very pleased with their attentiveness to the problem,\u201d Little said. \u201cI wish I could say the same to the other recipients of the letter, but they haven\u2019t responded yet.\u201d",

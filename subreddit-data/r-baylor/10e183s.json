They\u2019re both very rundown and management takes forever to answer maintenance requests, if they ever even get to them. Browning square is also across the street from many of the unofficial frat/sorority houses so it can get quite noisy on the weekends",

If you can, you should definitely check them out in person so you can see the area and what parts of campus are close. Management can also tell you if it\u2019s a primarily undergrad complex too!",

Could help narrow things down.\n\nEdit: a quick Google turned up 'Rat Faced Bear' and the years 1960-1970, but no concrete proof of year.\n\nEdit 2: family members that were there in the 50s to early 60s don't recognize it, and the only thing Google is turning up is an eBay listing for the same cup.",

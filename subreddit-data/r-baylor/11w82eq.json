Played worse than last years team who at least had a large comeback and went overtime with UNC. They also got the big 12 title too. \n\nNot sure how next season going to go with a couple of major people like Flagler and George going to the draft or graduating\u2026",

            "comment": "This team was deeply flawed as nobody in the rotation was really a true two-way player, especially our guards.  We made the call to sacrifice defense for offense in that case, which works against inferior teams or when you play at home.  However, you saw time and time again that when the offensive faucet ran dry, we were incapable of stopping te game from getting away from us.  Virginia/Marquette games in the fall &amp; KU/KSU/ISU games in the spring were massive red flags.  Luckily, the team has a strong chance to be better next year with JTT fully healthy, Love developing, Cryer/Bridges back, and two athletic/lengthy freshman in Walker &amp; Little coming in.  Just add some solid transfers at wing and we should contend in the big 12.",

I'm sad it's over and a little disappointed we didn't do better in the tournament but I'm happy they kept things interesting all year long. Hopefully next year's team is a little stronger defensively so that the wheels don't fall off when our shooting gets cold.",

Our offense is predicated on our guards winning their 1s with no lob threat to roll to the hoop when they draw help, and our guards aren\u2019t good enough to consistently win their 1s anyways.",

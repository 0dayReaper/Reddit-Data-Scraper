Drag them to a random sporting event with the promise of free T-shirts or something, all the minor sports are constantly giving away free stuff, and it's a safe environment that a wide spectrum of friends would feel comfortable attending. \n\nRandom sports are always playing games, you could easily catch a volleyball/basketball/tennis/soccer game. 20 days in September there is at least one sporting event.\n\nIf you end up going, you find that the minor sports also have die hard fan communities that are very fun and love to explain The finer points of the game if asked .",

            "comment": "The traditions!!! Baylor has some of the most special traditions of any college. A couple of my favorites were: the summer before freshman year you get to go to line camp where you learn all about the school and meet friends and learn the campus, etc. At the end of line camp you all go out to the original Baylor campus in independence Texas where you learn about the history of the school. There is a big ceremony and each person gets to walk through the pillars and you are presented with your Baylor Line Jersey\u2026 this is the moment you forever become part of the Baylor family. The way they do it is sooooo special. My other favorite is running the Baylor line at the home football games. You get to wear your line jersey and run out on to the field before the game and then you get a special section of the seats saved just for you. And they are the best seats in the house\u2026 then as a senior, for your very last home game you get to join the freshman and you all run together for the last time. It is so special and memorable. And then homecoming\u2026. Oh my goodness. Sooooooo much special traditions and fun. Too much to even explain. But my goodness, the thing about Baylor is they always go above and beyond to make you feel included and like you have a place in their family. No matter who you are. It\u2019s amazing. Anyways, just a few of my favorite things\u2026 I honestly don\u2019t have enough room or time to tell you about all of it. I could go on for days.",

The entire campus is set up with fun outdoor activities (my favorite being the beach day and kayaking at the Baylor Marina). \n\nAlso, you may know of this as a non-Baylor person but the marching band is a one-of-a-kind experience not only to watch, but especially to PLAY in!! I am going into my 4th year being in the marching band (AKA the Golden Wave Band) and to me, it's the main thing that has made attending Baylor worth it for me. All of my friends are in band and all of my memories are from band / with band people. All of my roommates for the past 3 years have been people I met in band. I may be attending grad school in Colorado with 2 people I met in band. Every rehearsal, every hype gameday, every pop-up performance/pep rally, every basketball/volleyball/soccer game, every volunteer opportunity...all have changed my life for the better. All you have to do is know how to play an instrument and/or be willing to learn one.",

Per the UN report from April on the matter, it has **nothing to do with a US shutdown.** It's based on **global** economic issues, the falling price of oil, lack of tourism, natural disasters and pre-existing conditions like [locust swarms in East Africa](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/new-larger-wave-locusts-threatens-millions-africa-n1181216) and the wars in Syria and Yemen.\n\nTrying to pin all of that on a hypothetical US shutdown is disingenuous at best and dishonest at worst.",

While this group of adults will have a very small death rate it doesn't take into account the fact that they will increase in infection rate which will cause more death within the high risk groups. Not only that, but if they help with the spread of the virus hospitals, which on a minor lvl decreases quality of care, and On an extreme lvl results in death panels (yes this happened at Starr County Memorial hospital in Texas). The more a hospital gets overwhelmed the more they decrease in quality care, increasing death rate.\n\nMortality rates also dont take into effect long term health issues caused by surviving the virus, which are still things that are actively being researched.",

I don't believe they publish mortality rate directly by age](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#AgeAndSex).\n\nMy from own research, I think it is fair to say that mortality rates are for college age students would be .1-.2%, or roughly 1-2 out of 1000 will die.  \n\n[Baylor currently has a cum rate of 200+ since August 1st](https://www.baylor.edu/coronavirus/index.php?id=972342), so we might expect that we need to see around 1000 people infected to see 1 or 2 people die.  Obviously, the older teaching / facility staff is at greater risk.\n\nThe more problematic issue is potential damage to both the heart or the lungs because you got sick.  COVID-19 gains entry through the ACE2 receptor, which is heavy in the hearts and the lungs. \n\nInflammation may do months or years worth of damage even though you don't die.  [See here to give a rough overview of potential issues](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-020-0360-5?fbclid=IwAR3TjvxiEtYQqNkpsPuEuuef94Gp2m4a89YFxubY2pw2FtOxsSpxGZ18TmI). They studied SARS-COV (the SARS infection, if you remember that, also a Corona Virus) and they found a disturbing impact 12 years after initial infection.  \n\nThe researchers note:\n\n&gt; Given that SARS-CoV-2 has a similar structure to SARS-CoV, this novel virus might also cause chronic damage to the cardiovascular system, and attention should be given to cardiovascular protection during treatment for COVID-19.\n\nPersonally, mitral valve prolapses and asthma would be of concerns to any student.  However, this is just speculation because we really don't have good research on this because the disease is just too new, and the focus is more on stopping deaths, not understanding non-fatal, but long term damage. \n\nWe simply don't have a good idea of the non-fatal aspects of this disease, but some concerns are clear.  Net-net:  Try not to get COVID-19 even as a college student because even if you don't die, you really don't want to have your heart or lungs impacted even if you don't die.",

If you are completely healthy, college age risk of dying in this analysis is effectively zero.  (Author words.)\n\n2. If you have comorbidity (other health issues) using college age range of late teens to 30ish for grad students, you could argue rough IFR (fatality rate) is .05 to .02% or even less.  \n\nAs I wrote above, I believe that SARS and anecdotal narratives would cause even a younger person with no commodities to strive to not get infected as there may be chronic and acute health issues.  My guess is that this will become much more clear over the next 4-5 months.",

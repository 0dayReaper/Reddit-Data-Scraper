    "postText": "I have poor credit and my parents do, too. Last year, we were able to get a no-credit student loan, but this year, the company decided not to renew our loan. I cannot find any loans that do not check for credit and we have been denied from Sallie Mae, Credible, Discover, pretty much anything that anyone has recommended. Our EFC is only $600 but Baylor expects us to pay $25,000 for the year. I have already called the school and there's nothing they can do. Does anyone have any suggestions? I am an out of state student so I am pretty much on my own in the middle of Texas. :(",

Upwards of $100,000 based on the limited info you've provided us with?\n\nI have tons of friends who have come out with debt but nowhere near that amount.\n\nBaylor did me so well and I was able to graduate debt free... I do NOT think I'd spend more than $10,000 a year at any college institution. I wouldn't recommend anyone do that.",

Don't believe anyone when they say it is \"good debt.\" It still will impact creditors when they decide if you can afford a car, house or even an apartment. So if you want those things, you will have to be very disciplined in order to build good credit so that they are willing to overlook your student loan debt amount.\n\nSo...\n\nI sincerely hope you can find a solution - like a smaller loan in combination with a payment plan, but if not, please know that it is likely a blessing in disguise.",

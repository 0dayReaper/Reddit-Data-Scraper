The apartments in park place are not super sound proof but nothing crazy happens usually during the week but we also are social and love to hang in the living room/kitchen area. \n\nThe room you would have has two windows and it\u2019s SO convenient. Comment if you need a place and I\u2019ll message you more details and questions!",

I would contact Parking Services directly for more info: [https://www.baylor.edu/dps/index.php?id=970814](https://www.baylor.edu/dps/index.php?id=970814).\n\nThey do have this info posted on their web page currently:\n\n2023-2024 Parking permits will go online for On Campus Residents June 5th.\r  \n\r  \nStudents living Off Campus will see permits online starting July 31.",

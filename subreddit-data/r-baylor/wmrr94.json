    "postText": "I didn\u2019t attend my first semester in the fall, so I\u2019m not sure what kind of clothes to bring for this semester. As someone who lives by the border in Texas, how cold does it get? Enough for at least one heavy winter jacket or could I breeze by with mostly long sleeves until Thanksgiving break? Also would it still be warm enough to need to bring tshirts? Thank you! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

I\u2019d recommend a couple of sweaters and a bigger jacket to wear over it and act as a windbreaker. \n\nThough if you\u2019ve been here in Jan/February, it doesn\u2019t get worse than that.",

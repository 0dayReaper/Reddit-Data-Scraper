First, remember that Baylor kicked the field goal the first time with 1 min + left and then the penalty got them the first down. I say that because it\u2019s not like it was a last minute slam on OU. It\u2019s all about the Big 12 championship game. If there\u2019s a tie, the Big 12 considers head to head matchups and then the point spread. Baylor lost to OSU by 10. We needed to beat OU by more than 10 to play the Big 12 championship game in case of a 3 way tie. Coach Aranda knew that going in. So now if OSU beats OU we\u2019re in because we have the head to head win. If OU beats OSU and OU loses to Iowa State we\u2019re in because of the point spread. The worst scenario for Baylor right now is OU and OSU both win next week and then OSU beats OU.",

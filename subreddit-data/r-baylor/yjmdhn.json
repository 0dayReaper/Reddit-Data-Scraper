Our network is small, but very loyal to each other and our university. I love meeting Bears around the state and country. It\u2019s like a built-in support system. I personally like that it\u2019s a smaller network because I really feel part of something unique.",

It gave us something to talk about and made the interview process easier.\n\nI've also had past interviews with A&amp;M alumni that black listed me from jobs so there's that.",

(Grads Of Last Decade)!\n\n&gt; It\u2019s time to sign up for the BU Professionals of Denver breakfast on 10/13 and we have a discounted GOLD price for our recent grads. You won\u2019t want to miss this one! Details and registration link is below. Can\u2019t wait to see you there! This is our last event for the year. \n\n&gt; Join Denver-area Baylor alumni, parents, and friends for a networking breakfast at Syrup Cherry Creek! Featured guest speaker, Brad Hill (BBA '96), Chief Solutions Officer at Gloo will join us to share his experience solving technology challenges for the church for over 20 years and how faith informs his business practices.\n\nMaybe I misread a bit of the prosperity gospel, I'm just wary of it anytime someone throws \"faith\" and \"business practice\" in at the same time.",

    "postText": "Hi, me (F) got accepted into baylor in october, I got invited - and participated - in the Invitation to Excellence. I have a 4.0 unweighted GPA, 4.5 weighted, 33 ACT, and number 26 out of 487 on a weighted scale. A couple days ago Baylor\u2019s financial packages came out. I got 16k per year (64k in total). This would roughly make my cost of attending this school between 40k and 50k. I might receive a couple thousand dollars from the I2E event and Honors College, but not much. I do not qualify for need based aid. My parents make too much for me to get need based, but they (and I as well who works) also do not make enough to afford 4 years of a school that costs that much. \nI am reluctant about taking out loans because I want to go to med school, and I do not want to be in debd for that long. My second school choice is Oklahoma University. I am and OK resident and get a tuition waiver as merit scholarship. Room and Board and expenses for a year would be around 20k a year.\n\nIS BAYLOR WORTH ALL THIS MONEY? Please give me some advice, just so I can think better on my decision!\n\nThanks guys!",

            "comment": "Baylor probably has a more renowned pre-med program than Oklahoma. But it's not six figures worth of debt better. Once upon a time, school reputation may have been the most important factor in choosing where to attend college. But there's no way I could in good conscience advise someone to go somewhere that would cause them to rack up that much debt. If you can get most or all of your expenses covered by going to OU, choose that route.",

But between what he got in financial aid and what we had saved for college we covered it because I said there would be no student loans. I don\u2019t believe any school is worth going into debt for and wanted him to graduate debt free, which he did. As much as I dislike OU (B12 rivalry) I would not go into debt for Baylor, especially if you want to go to med school. Now Baylor would certainly prepare you very well for med school but do you want all the debt? Just one person\u2019s opinion.",

    "postText": " Hi, I got accepted to both UTD and Baylor for premed. For context, I am not a Christian and though I respect people's choices, I am not really interested in too much Christian stuff. I would love to choose Baylor but I am a little worried about a lot of the posts suggesting that one might not have much of a social life given they don't want to join frats and are not Christian. I want to enjoy my undergrad while also being able to maintain a good GPA. (I heard about a lot of the classes being hard at Baylor and that Baylor has a bad grading system that makes it harder to get and maintain a good GPA). I also know how important extracurriculars and class size are so I would appreciate any views on that too. \n\nI really like the Premed program at UTD and Baylor. I would appreciate any views on how either university will help me become a more well rounded person and get into medical school. Also UTD didn't tell me anything about scholarships yet while I got a 70K $ scholarship at BU.",

We\u2019re also going to have stronger extracurriculars and good sporting events (you can make friends by going to the games). \n\nDon\u2019t worry about not being Christian; 90% of people won\u2019t really care. Even as a Christian I steer clear of the other 10% because they\u2019re just annoying af. Best of luck in your decision!",

Baylor has a lot more clubs and activities, and as long as you are social you can make a lot of friends between your classes and your residence. It sounds like you take your academics seriously, so maybe consider joining the Honors College or BIC and you'll be around like minded people for the vast majority of each day.",

            "comment": "I had this same concern coming into Baylor... I'm a senior pre-med starting med school in August now. I will admit living on campus and with spring rush, first semester was rough, and I was not sure baylor was the fit for me because I was not in a church group etc. I rushed in the spring freshmen year and found my people, and immediately was relieved from that pressure. I think if you want to pursue a religious or faith based education Baylor is the place to do it, but its also completely avoidable, and I do not feel pressured to be a part of it at all anymore. I do not know anything about UTD pre-med, but I will say baylor pre-health grinds to get us into medical school and I do not think I would have any clue how to do it without the pre-health committee. There's a whole process you can do where you like \"fake apply\" to medical school but it really prepares you. Feel free to reach out with questions.",

UTD is good academically but you will absolutely have a better experience doing 4 years at Baylor. 70k is good scholarship, you should apply for outside scholarships too, don\u2019t only take what Baylor offers.",

I don't know anything about UTD but I can confirm that Baylor basically has a medical school admissions formula that works really well. From my closest undergrad friend group alone, 5 of us are in medical school, all accepted on the first try. I also found a lot of social and community   \n building opportunities. I am not super extroverted and was not interested in Greek life so I was very active during optional activities like Line Camp and Welcome Week. There are also a lot of pre-med clubs (when I was there you were actually required to join one for at least 1 semester) where you will also be able to make friends. Overall, I think Baylor's pre-med and social opportunities are better than what I've seen or heard from other friends, relatives, or med school classmates' undergraduate experiences.",

            "comment": "Baylor premed is probably one of the best in the country. The pre-health committee guides you through the whole process, starting with a list of which classes to take and when, advisors, and by the time you reach junior year, a premed mock interview leading to a strong composite letter of recommendation (made of impressions from your professors, your CV, your grades and good things from that mock interview) being sent along with your transcript to all the med schools you apply to.\n\nThe premed classes, including lectures and labs, are rigorous, I\u2019m not gonna lie about it. You will need to put some serious effort in order to maintain your GPA. You will have help from your professors (class sizes are small so you can get 1-on-1 help from professors after class or at office hours), from tutors who have gone through those classes before and from your fellow classmates.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Baylor for anyone who is serious about becoming a physician and is willing to dedicate the next 4 years to spending a lot of time studying. Everyone I know who\u2019s met the requirements set by the pre-health committee and wanted to be doctors are now full-fledged attending physicians (MD or DO) in a variety of specialties.\n\nYou will have plenty of opportunities to socialize- intramurals, clubs, volunteering opportunities, concerts, games.\n\nIf you can, try to study abroad too. Another great thing about Baylor.\n\nI hope that answers your questions. PM me if you have more.",

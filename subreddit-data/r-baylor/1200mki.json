There are better electives once you get into your last year. Try to take classes outside the school of business - I took computer science and poli sci / history",

Since covid, a lot of classes have adopted the at-home exam schedule, but don't count on it to be that way for every course. I'm two semesters away from graduating in Finance and I'd agree with what the other person on here said. You get out what you put in.",

We\u2019ve all watched the men heartbreakingly lose in the tournament to Georgia State or Yale but even then, the men have been consistently ranked/seeded pretty high.

But one of the marks of a good team is being able to win even when you're playing poorly and they're playing well. I'd say we checked off that box today.\n\nThe concern from this game going forward is that other teams with far more talent might adopt some of OSU's schemes against us. In particular, they neutralized a lot of our shooting in the first half by playing a 3-2 zone and coming really far out on the perimeter. The counter to this was to kick the ball inside to Vital (and later Butler) at the high post, who would kick it back out or further down. But the chemistry just wasn't there at a high level like it usually is. It was the first time I'd ever seen our players get a little annoyed at each other on the court; they're usually perfectly in sync. Vital in particular was visibly frustrated with some of his teammates not dumping it into him as much as he wanted. I suspect that, should we play that scheme again, we'd be a little more ready for it.",

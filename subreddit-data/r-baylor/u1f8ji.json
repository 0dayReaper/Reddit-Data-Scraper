I\u2019m pretty sure it might have been stolen, nothing from the police department after I filed a police report. I\u2019ll post a pic if anyone needs it. It has a diary in it, and I don\u2019t want anyone reading personal info about my life. Plus, it has headphones in there too.",

Turns out, someone picked them up and brought them to the building's lost and found. For all the negative stuff I have to say about Baylor, those glasses would've been long gone anywhere else in the world. It's possible someone turned the bag into an admin or secretary or someone.",

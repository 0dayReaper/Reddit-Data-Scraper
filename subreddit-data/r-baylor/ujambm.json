Is parking always available/accessible and are cars safe? \n\nWhen you attended Baylor, did you feel like it was a good idea to bring a car?\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone that responded. My younger cousin was wondering about this and will be attending Baylor this fall. Your responses have been very helpful!",

I keep my car at my apartment and walk to class, and there's a ton of people who just park on the street who don't want to pay for a spot in the garages.\n\nI'd recommend a car. Waco *could* be walkable, but with all the construction and traffic right now it isn't.",

That being said, you will know people with cars, and can often get rides wherever you need so long as you don't need to do it too often.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParking around campus is safe, though often competitive for decent spots. I didn't bring a car until my Junior year, which worked well for me. Depending on how often you're likely to do things outside of campus, it may be better to have a car earlier.",

Even the little things like going to grab some groceries, going to the movies, going for some junk along the grease pit. Having to bum a ride off of friends isn't the worst thing in the world, but it'll get old quick",

There are also quite a few areas to park off campus that don't require a parking permit.",

But nearing the 1st semester of my sophomore year, I knew walking to Penland for food or waiting on my roommates to go to HEB was not worth my time when I could just bring my car for free. \n\nBottom line: bring your car if you\u2019re an off-campus student",

If you want to head to Walmart, HEB, or other places, you'll either have to have your car or mooch off a friend. If you don't want to park in the garages or lots, a ton of people (including myself) park on the street. If you park on the street, make sure you can parallel park!",

After all, paying for a car, car insurance and gas isn\u2019t cheap.",

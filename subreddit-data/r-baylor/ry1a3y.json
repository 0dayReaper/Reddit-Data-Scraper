            "comment": "Baylor has an excellent pre-med program. One of the best in my opinion. Be forewarned that it is an extremely difficult program with a number of drop out each year. However, undergraduate studies for medicine can be done in a number of places. Your actual medical learning and training would be done in medical school and during your residency. You attend medical school after you complete your undergraduate. Medical school has its own tests and application process.",

Like the first guy said, they do NOT fuck around with weeding out, haha.",

If you do what you\u2019re supposed to do, maintain an overall and science GPA up (at least 3.5 but ideally, above 3.7), then during your junior year, the premed committee will arrange a mock interview, give you feedback for your upcoming medical school interviews, compile all your letters of recommendation, write a nice glowing letter of recommendation in the name of the entire Baylor premed committee with good quotes from your professors- all of which will be sent to the medical schools you apply to. Combine all that with a great MCAT score, good social skills during your interviews and you\u2019ll be good to go.\nAlmost all my friends who applied with me during junior year of college are doctors (MD or DO) today. A few became dentists.",

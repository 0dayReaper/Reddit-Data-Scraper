            "comment": "No one will fault you for not wanting to participate. I used to be a CL (which is baylor language for an RA). Some of the activities will be fun, some will be stupid. I will say, if your CL puts on an event, it\u2019s worth going. They\u2019ll likely have free food and they put a lot of hard work into events. Just showing up means a lot to the CL\u2014even if you only go for like 5 minutes. Participating in LLC events is not mandatory. It\u2019s the residence hall\u2019s attempt to try and connect with everyone. They do take the time and effort to put on those events. So I suggest you go to at least one. It\u2019s worth giving it a shot.\n\nEdit: your CLs will likely also host small events as well. I brought a water boiler to my desk duty and brought a bunch of hot cocoa. Wasn\u2019t an official event but ended up being the best event of my time as a CL. Residents came and went and a lot even came downstairs solely to get some hot chocolate. No obligation to talk to me. I just wanted to make the best of my painfully long desk shift.",

I know they had a class you could sign up for but I didn\u2019t. It might be different where you\u2019re looking though. I\u2019d check the website or call the office of living and learning!",

I thought all LLC's had specific application processes to join.\n\nI would recommend calling Campus Living &amp; Learning as soon as you can to get some answers. Depending on the LLC, this is way different than just 'not going to events put on by the CL' like in a standard dorm situation. You could be in a cohort and taking the same classes as the people living around you, which would vastly change your college experience if you're then the only person not participating and don't want to be there.",

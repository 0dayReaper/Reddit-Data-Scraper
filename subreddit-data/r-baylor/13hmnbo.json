The Baylor bus has a drop off and pick up station so students who have class can use that to get across campus without having to walk. The only cons is that the walls are so thin that you can hear other people screaming and the wifi does sometimes go off.",

Management was attentive and work orders were always completed or attended to the day of or within like 48 hours. I will agree with the other comment about walls being thin, but other than that it was super close to campus so you didn\u2019t have to worry about a parking pass and they have amenities as well. Wish their gym was bigger though.",

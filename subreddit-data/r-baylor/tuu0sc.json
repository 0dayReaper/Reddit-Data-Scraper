To the right is an asexual pride flag, and to the left is...I have no idea. Above the Iowa State logo looks pretty chaotic, so that might be the best place to put it. Alternatively, if they open up even more space tomorrow, could also place it there.",

I also don't necessarily have time to coordinate the effort...I can just do some pixel art (/u/gidagwadajed, want to lead the effort?). \n\nBest bet is to call upon the Iowa State people to help out since it's sort of their idea (/u/alienatedframe, want to help out?). Could also call upon Baylor social media spaces since Baylor tends to have a strong social media game (or at least they did at one point).",

He's solidly a better overall athlete than shapen, but i'm not sure where his decision making and arm talent is really at.\n\nEnd of the day I don't think this team's problems lie at QB, not exclusively anyway. The defense and special teams are a much bigger concern.",

                    "comment": "Agree all around. \n\nI will say I think Shapen and Drones decision making is weaker in different areas from our limited experience with Drones. \n\nShapen seems not great on 4th down decision making having thrown balls away and sliding short. \n\nDrones seems to not have the experience for strong decision making in a hurry-up offense like a 2-minute drill. \n\nI think Drones will be fine against Kansas if we keep a comfortable lead but I\u2019ll be worried if its a shootout like WVU\n\nEdit: It\u2019s essentially going to come down to the defense executing a half competent pass coverage",

            "comment": "Drones seems to have a higher ceiling than Shapen and looked absolutely fearless coming into the game. Once the game slows down for him, he'll definitely be the guy. Shapen just seems to keep on making clumsy and costly errors that he shouldn't be making at this point.\n\nWith that, neither one of them were responsible for the defensive meltdown last week. If that doesn't get fixed, it won't matter who is at QB.",

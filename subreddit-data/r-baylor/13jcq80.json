For reference my daughter is majoring in Neuroscience (pre-med.)\n\nAny advice would be helpful! \u2764\ufe0f",

We did this through a dorm tour and my kid applied for Teal Residential (I believe it\u2019s the newest building on campus). We got to talk to some of the current residents and they said it was always quite because the residents respected others time and sleep. She was notified this morning she got a room.",

Of course, what you can get away with is highly dependent on how lenient your CL is and how well you get along with others on your floor. \n\nKickbacks sure, but parties no. The ambitious few that do attempt to throw get stamped out by Baylor PD. Lots of students value their sleep and won't hesitate to call in a noise complaint.",

Still, it was an experience that I wouldn't trade for anything else. \n\nWe found out that we could take the doors off their hinges. Windows could be uninstalled with a Phillips head screwdriver. You could hide stuff in the ceiling. Some Penland guys put a tarp down to make a slip-and-slide in the hallway. \n\nCollege!",

Lots of girls in Greek Life. Formerly known as \"Crusty Collins\" but has recently undergone renovations. May not be the best choice if you don't fit into the typical \"Baylor Girl\" archetype. Has a pool which is used primarily for sunbathing. \n\nKOKERNOT: All-girls as well. Smaller, more inclusive. Has a quieter vibe. I went on a date with a girl who lived there. It didn't go anywhere. \n\nPENLAND: Large co-ed dorm, although sexes are separated by floor. Typical college living experience, for better or worse. Great place to meet people, but it may be harder to build genuine friendships. Located centrally on campus. Most likely the most fun dorm. \n\nS. RUSSELL: Co-ed, inclusive. Great faculty-in-residence. It's where to live to grow as a student. A bit secluded, but that's not bad for a premed student. \n\ngood luck and make sure to audit your potential roomates haha!",

It\u2019s not specific to one major so there will be lots of different people. Someone mentioned a pool/sun deck; that will be gone with the renovation. Collins is close to memorial and brooks dining halls as well as the SUB. \nI wouldn\u2019t choose a dorm based on how close it is to certain buildings because schedules will change and it\u2019s better to be happier in your \u201chome\u201d space than close to your classes.",

Brooks is a 2-year contract and the vast majority (maybe 90%) of students live off campus sophomore year (which is also much cheaper), so just be aware of that commitment. Brooks is a bit further away than Penland from the science building but does have better floor plans (apartment style vs. double or triple room).",

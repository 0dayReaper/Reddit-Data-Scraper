Any reccomend actions for how I can pull this off? If I pay the housing fee and buy an apartment on the side (aside from being pricy) will my CL next year care I don't live there at all?",

Most people don\u2019t have the financial resources to pull that off and if you do, it\u2019s maybe worth asking yourself why you can\u2019t figure out how to make a semester in a dorm work out?  There will be some challenges in life you can\u2019t buy your way out of.\nI don\u2019t mean to sound critical but maybe this is a growth opportunity is all I\u2019m thinking.",

As of right now, contracts are still for 1 year except in specific dormitories (the LLCs) that are a 2 year commitment.  And honestly, if money isn't a concern, I'd say go for it.  If it is though, I'd probably start looking for loopholes in the contract or find an open apartment.  Good luck doing that at this stage though.",

You can get married (knowing Baylor, probably has to be heterosexual)\n4. You can withdraw/transfer and reenroll\n\nWhat I did was just keep my clothes in a basket in my car\u2019s trunk and slept on a buddy\u2019s couch all semester. Still had to pay for a dorm but they can\u2019t enforce you actually staying in it. Then I studied abroad the next semester and got out of the dorm contract.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! \n\nGerry Bohanon &amp; SicEm365 are excited to announce an on-going partnership! Support it by trying premium content a FULL year for just $15.00 by using [SicEm365.com/gerry](http://sicem365.com/gerry?fbclid=IwAR19ibtwEv_AAZHoK8kIihnFgPr_jHYyvq4tpW6PxRaA5MEM_cMcXh39MeI) \n\nThis site is FANTASTIC for those who are interested in hearing about Baylor sports, connecting with other students, donors, alumni, and fans. They also put on a daily podcast from 3-6pm where they bring on guests like Scott Drew, Dave Aranda, past football and basketball players, and they even talk about all other sports like Women's Basketball, Tennis etc. They also talk about NFL and other major pro sports if you are into those topics as well. \n\nI do want to emphasize that this is a great way to get involved in Name, Image, and Likeness for our student athletes. Subscription process in part go to our student athletes, hence why this 15 dollar subscription is going towards NIL money for Gerry Bohannon. There are also other deals you can hop onto as well, such as signing up for exclusive showings of the Baylor documentary \"Ode to Joy,\" getting signed pictures of student athletes from this past year (e.g., Al Walcott's interception in the Sugar Bowl) amongst other things. This site has something for everyone! \n\nNOTE: I do not work for site nor have anything to gain for this post. Just wanted to get this information out there for those who are interested in Baylor media and sports as well as supporting our student athletes! Happy to answer any questions you have too (to the best of my knowledge).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSic'Em Bears!",

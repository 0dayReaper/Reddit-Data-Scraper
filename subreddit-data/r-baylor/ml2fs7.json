From there it's been history. Without these 6  guys we would not have made it. Dugat was actually ranked higher than Jerrels coming out of high school. Lot of people don't remember that.",

If UCLA had squeaked by, everyone would be questioning whether Baylor could have beaten Gonzaga.  If we had beaten Gonzaga in a close game, it would have been called a fluke.  Thankfully, no one questions that our team is the rightful champion.\n\nI'm going to remember this for a long time. Culture of JOY!",

That was a new gear that Baylor found in those 2 games, this team was special &amp; scary good. I am still basking in the glory of this win. I have my championship swag to prove it (picked it up today from the Baylor Bookstore - bought it online on Monday night after they won).",

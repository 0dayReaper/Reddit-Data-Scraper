    "postText": "Hi! \n\nI am heavily considering applying to be a CL. I am currently a sophomore. I was very close to my CL last year, and I really love what the job entails. I read over the list of requirements today and one requirement concerned me, however. It states that I need to be an active member of a local church as well as actively growing my faith. Though everything in me wants to grow my faith, it just has not worked out. I am on my second year of being an office assistant (OA) for a dorm, and with school, I have not had time to sit down and focus solely on my faith. I hold leadership positions in multiple clubs and I am actively involved on campus, but I do not really identify as a practicing Christian. I have Christian values, but I have not been involved in any church. \n\nHas anyone had luck getting hired as a CL with lacking church involvement? I feel as if a CL who doesn't identify with any one religion may be beneficial to residents questioning their faith or wondering how they can grow in their faith. More importantly, I think I would be able to grow my own faith as well as interact with peers in a new light. Who knows, maybe it would push me to become more involved in church.\n\nAny suggestions?? Thank you :)",

I was leading a bunch of clubs, took too many classes, and grew a lot at Seventh &amp; James. It's also a great place to explore your faith. They gave me room to doubt and debate and argue while I was considering converting to Judaism, but ultimately their love and support is why I felt a call to ministry.",

Though, I got hired as a mid year hire so it was kind of different. My lack of religion didn\u2019t really affect my job at all (barring that I got in some trouble for refusing to hang up homophobic posters given to us by the YCT in my hall). It was overall a really good experience even if it was short lived for me!",

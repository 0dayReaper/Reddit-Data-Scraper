I\u2019m also wondering if y\u2019all have any tips on how to keep GPA high / how much y\u2019all studied. I\u2019m planning to do ECE and Pre-Med/Honors and was just looking for tips and such. Thanks!",

Engineering just doesn't prepare you for med school. I worked my butt off for 4 years and was less prepared than if I'd done a more traditional major. If you want to be an engineer be an engineer. If you want to be a doctor be a doctor. Don't do engineering pre med.",

I couldn\u2019t imagine trying to balance all of the pre-med stuff my son has to do (he\u2019s at Baylor) on top of that. Try to make your college journey some-what enjoyable. Good luck to you!",

            "comment": "Bro, you are going to be faced with one of the most strenuous, toughest 4 years at Baylor. Premed, ECE and honors classes have weeder courses across the board. As a premed, GPA is important and at the same time, you also should be involved in other things outside of academics. Unless you know programming and CS well, the classes at Baylor are different and tough especially the intro to CS. I don\u2019t know of any one doing ECE or ME premed, although some did bioinformatics premed (like me) and switched into biology because it was heavy overall. \n\nI would suggest you take into account the fact that not only you need to maintain a good GPA for premed, but also involved in extracurriculars of your passion and other things as well. Finding the right balance is my #1 tip to you and maintaining a good mental health is #2. #3 Stay on top of your work, study consistently and don\u2019t procrastinate. It\u2019s going to be a grind so be prepared for it. That\u2019s just my two cents.",

I could do Engineering with a Concentration in Biomedical but that kinda sucks as a degree according to engineers I\u2019ve spoken with. My brother tells me based off how I did in high school they think I should be fine. I think the thing I\u2019m most scared about is being introduced to far harder subject material. I took a lot of APs though all of which were kinda intensive so I\u2019m hoping they prepared me at least a little. I just wanted to know if there was anybody taking those tracks or if people even had 3.7+ GPA\u2019s in ECE or MechE",

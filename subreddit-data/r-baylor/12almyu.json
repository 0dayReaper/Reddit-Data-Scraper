    "postText": "Like the title suggests im an intl student who received a decision back in February and also received a merit scholarship of 18k a year which is just not enough for me since my efc is about 5k a year. I submitted the CSS profile back in January. I was so close to committing but just got an email from the fin aid counselor saying i wont receive any aid since I'm an intl :( what do i do? The merit scholarship just isn't enough and from what I've heard the intl student scholarship (app form that i recently submitted) is hardly a few thousand dollars. I might need at least 55k more in scholarships to attend   \ndo i contact the financial aid office or sumn else?? Because i really want to attend Baylor. I don't really have any other backups esp not in my home country",

            "comment": "Baylor is stingy with aid. Especially for international students. They depend on international students paying nearly full fee for income. You might be able to get a little more merit aid but no way you are going to close a 55k gap. Also the merit aid is contingent upon maintaining very high grades. I have heard 3.7-3.8. You can drop below that by getting a B or two the first year and then you are left with no aid at all. Nearly all the need based aid that US students are Pell Grants and guaranteed student loans for the government and you are not eligible for that. A lot of US students can\u2019t come up with the money either because they fall short even maxing out loans. Baylor is very expensive and does not give out much aid. You need to look at schools that are less competitive and try to get 100 percent merit aid",

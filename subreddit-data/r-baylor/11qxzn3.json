There are also a couple of drivers that many Baylor students use for this (UBear Airport Shuttle). The OCM foundation (Baylor Support/ Service Group) partners with Waco Streak and charters busses for Baylor Students to Airports during breaks (Christmas Spring Break Thanksgiving) you could check that out as well. Hope this helps.",

My only request was money for gas and treat me to lunch lol. Unfortunately there really aren\u2019t many other ways other than Uber/Lyft and bus like kirobaito88 mentioned. The only other option would be to rent a car for those three times or take the greyhound they day before you need to be there since it doesn\u2019t drop off as early as you need, but I\u2019m assuming that might cut into school time for you.",

Seems like you\u2019re looking for budget friendly options so that\u2019s probably not the way to go. I would just reiterate mine and a few others sentiment of just finding someone nice enough to get you there and back. That\u2019s gonna be the most cost efficient. Unfortunately, Waco is a tough place to be if you are without your own car and ever need to go anywhere that isn\u2019t within Waco. Trust me, I was the person with the vehicle that everyone who didn\u2019t went to for a ride.",

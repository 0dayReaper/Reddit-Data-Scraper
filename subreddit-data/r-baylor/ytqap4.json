Let\u2019s just get this out of the way: I\u2019ve spent the better part of this last week with a severe stomach bug, and that experience was preferable to watching this absolute train wreck of a football game. I\u2019m a middle-aged American male college football fan. It doesn\u2019t take that much to make a game enjoyable for me. This missed every mark. Sorry everyone, this is gonna be a real salty take.\n\n* **Biggest Disappointment:** Hoo boy. This was an absolute embarrassment of a performance on every level. Athlete performance, play calling, coaching decisions, crowd interaction, lack of home field advantage in any meaningful way during a damn blackout game\u2026 Look man, I\u2019ve been on the toilet for approximately 50% of my time this week, and this was still the biggest pile of shit I\u2019ve seen.\t\n\n* **Player of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* No.\n * *Defense:* Nuh-uh.\n\n* **Play of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* Nope. \n * *Defense:* Negative, Ghost Rider.\n\n\n* **What We Learned:** Hell if I know man. A few weeks ago I said this team had an identity crisis, that sometimes they play like no one can stop them and sometimes it looks like they just didn\u2019t get the memo. Tonight it looked like they let Midway Middle suit up in their places.\n\n* **Next Week:** We\u2019re not quite done with purple nightmares yet. TCU is coming to town for a good ol\u2019 Revivalry. Let\u2019s hope both Baylor and I get all the shit out of our systems before then. It\u2019ll be a more enjoyable experience for everyone involved.\n\n* **Weekly Pickem Winner:** Well y\u2019all apparently didn\u2019t learn the lesson about going full homer the last two times this happened *this season*, and no one predicted a K-State win. We\u2019ll pick two winners next week.\n\n---\n\n*Have anything to add? Comments? Concerns? Corrections? Shove \u2018em up your butt! NAGN is going to go attempt to return to his baseline existence and forget this game ever happened.*",

If they could have beaten K-State, they could go and lose to TCU, and if they then beat UT to close out the season, that would have put them into the Big 12 Championship game, regardless of what K-State did the rest of the way, because they'd have the tie-breaker over K-State.  Had a potential Big 12 title game berth to play for, and they play the worst they've played all year, scoring 3 points on their home field!  Just completely unacceptable for a team that was seemingly on the rise, having won 3 straight.  I have to say I'm done watching them for the year after that, at least the regular season.  Might catch a bowl game if they play in one.  I'll try to catch some of the remaining marquee games, like the SEC championship (Georgia v LSU), Ohio State v Michigan (2 times possibly, not sure how the Big 10 works and their schedules), and I'll probably watch the Big 12 championship (looking like TCU v K-State).  But that's it.  Not interested in watching Baylor anymore this season, after that kind of result when they had everything to play for, on their home field, and they showed up and did that.\r  \n\r  \nYeah, the tipped pass interception on the first drive was a harbinger of things to come.  When I saw that, I had the feeling it was going to be a bad evening for them.  And then #34 drops the pass at the 4 yard line with the 1st half winding down, and they could have taken a shot for a TD after that and cut it to 17-7 going into the half, but instead had to settle for a field goal.\"\n\n(Baylor alum, '01, Engineering)",

With so much on the line, on your home field, and you go out and do.....whatever that was. \n\nCrowd was flat.  I noticed that.  I always liked that the Baylor crowd seems to always be very respectful (probably the Christian influence) and not over-the-top obnoxious and gaudy.  But they could make some more noise.  Contrast it with the Georgia crowd at the start of the Georgia v Tennessee game.  That was a crowd!",

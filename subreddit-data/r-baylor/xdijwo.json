Like I said, when you get your information from social media, you don\u2019t necessarily know the facts.\n\nWhat happened at Baylor under Briles was sickening. However, unless you can submit evidence that Starr knowingly covered up rapes, you shouldn\u2019t make such allegations. You wouldn\u2019t want people doing that to you. \n\nAs President of BU when the sexual assaults happened, it was appropriate for Starr to go because that happened under his watch. However, it\u2019s a big jump to assert that he willingly covered up these awful crimes.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to make statements like yours under the anonymous protection of social media. What you\u2019ve stated could set you up for a libel lawsuit if you posted your real name. \n\nI\u2019m done with this. Sic em.",

There is of course a sense in which the person at the top is responsible for a vaguely defined \u201ccampus culture\u201d, but the PH report presumably didn\u2019t find that Starr had any substantive involvement, and the BoR accordingly didn\u2019t call for resignation. It was only after a public outcry that Starr was pushed to resign, and some more outcry for him to resign from the Law school.\n\nThat public outcry was largely motivated by Ken Starr\u2019s polarizing career in politics, particularly the juicy irony of his involvement with the sexual harassment accusations against Bill Clinton. I think that is borne out by the vitriol in this thread.",

And then told her she wouldn\u2019t make it long in the law school if she was \u201cacting this way\u201d. You don\u2019t need to defend him. He has a decades long record of defending and enabling sex criminals.",

At the time, it made my blood boil. How dare he wear the logo of something he impugned and maligned so greatly. I have no feelings of remorse over his death, but I don\u2019t rejoice it either. All I can say is the baylor community at large should little mourn his passing.",

I'm a disabled combat veteran, I'm curious if there any student that are throwing away any computers, laptop or desktop doesn't matter.  I'm mainly looking for something to play games on.  My laptop broke about a year ago and the VA disability pay is crap so I can't buy one, I've also looked into non profit organizations to get one but have had no luck with those. \n\nAny help is greatly appreciated, can provide VA disability proof if required.",

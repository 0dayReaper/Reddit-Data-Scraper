    "postText": "Hi. I am an international applicant from Brazil who will be pursuing a business related major and wants to make the best college decision possible. Right now I find myself having a lot of trouble deciding between Baylor and SMU. I have been accepted in both schools and their cost will be pretty much the same with the scholarships I received. I think that SMU is better academically wise (in business/finance) according to rankings and has a better overall score on niche and rate my professor. However, I think I will fit better in terms of social life studying at Baylor. I have read a lot of criticisms of SMU\u2019s snobby and rich students, and I feel that the Baylor community is more open and friendly, besides having more students so more opportunities to find some great friends. Can you guys help me presenting arguments in favor of your university?",

We won the national championship for basketball and won the Big 12 championship football game.\n\nBaylor just hit the R1 research level, giving it international recognition as an institution where scientific advancements and knowledge are sought - and even more unique is that it does this without sacrificing any of its Christian roots.\n\nBut you aren't here for research! As a business-ish student you'll be spending a lot of time in the Foster Building, which is our new building exclusively for business students. It's beautiful, incredibly useful, and has a ton of great places and ways to study, and it was paid for by a former business student at Baylor who wanted to give back. As a former business student I promise this thing is amazing.\n\nI'm a junior who wouldn't even think about transferring! If you have any more questions please ask!",

            "comment": "I'll preface by saying that both schools rankings are similar enough that I think you'll find more success where you feel more at home. Plenty of studies have shown the individual matters more than the school name.\n\nIf you want to weigh difference between the two schools I think where you're planning to work after graduation could matter. If you think you won't stay in the U.S then Baylor will carry more of a name brand internationally going forward, now that they've achieved R1 status. For better or worse peoples undergrads on an international scale get their 'prestige' from the grad schools research. That is why UT-Austin is more widely known than Rice internationally. \n\nIf you think you'd want to stay in Dallas than I think SMU would give you the better network without a doubt. In other parts of Texas it would be fairly equal. In other parts of the country Baylor might be more known but that really only matters at top 20 schools.\n\nI'm sure you could find your crowd at both schools and while I cant directly speak on SMU if you're a fairly social person you'd have no trouble making friends at Baylor. If I were you I would look more at things such as city preferences, if sports matter, and campus environment.",

I don\u2019t have concrete plans after graduating but I know I will be able to stay in the US for a few years after I get my degree. If I could get a really good job in this mean time I could extend my stay in the us and maybe as my career advances, get a green card.  For this reason, I have the impression that Dallas, being a bigger city, could facilitate this process. However, I am willing to go anywhere in the US that offers me good employment opportunities after graduation",

I got accepted into both SMU and Baylor but liked Baylor's vibe better. The difference in rankings are very minimal especially if you actually look at how they formulate those rankings. That's why the US News gold standard gets under a lot of scrutiny. You are choosing between Baylor and SMU, not Baylor and Harvard. If anything Baylor is trending to pass up SMU in those rankings more than anything. \n\nHowever, if you're dead set on working in Dallas, SMU would make it easier getting initial interviews since the city is familiar with SMU grads. Long term though, your work is what'll matter more than where you got your degree. With that said, plenty of companies recruit out of Baylor, and truthfully, those companies seem to be growing at the career fair every yr. To give you an idea, I was able to get an internship with JP Morgan last summer and now got one lined up with Goldman Sachs NY office this summer. Plenty of other students here find such opportunities. In the end your resume matter more than whether you went to school at Baylor or SMU, the Dallas preference is more for when an SMU Alumni stumbles upon your resume and gives you a more detailed look just because of your connection to them. \n\nIn the end choose what feel right to you tho.",

Before that semester, it was only the guys... so I guess I was a freshman two years before instead of one.\n\nIn 2017.. they had a Ceremonial Running for all alumni women who were not allowed to run when they were freshmen.  Unfortunately, I'm disabled now and wasn't able to participate.  But I did order a Line Jersey.\n\nhttps://www.baylor.edu/mediacommunications/news.php?action=story&amp;story=188016#:\\~:text=The%20Baylor%20Line%20became%20a,Baylor%20Bears%20to%20the%20field.",

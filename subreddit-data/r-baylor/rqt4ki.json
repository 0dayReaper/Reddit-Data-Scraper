As a thoughtful gift, a family member took me to Waco for Christmas so I could see the campus. I was able to see the social work building and was wondering why it\u2019s not on the main campus and doesn\u2019t seem to be as nice as the other facilities. Any idea why?",

Being downtown makes it more accessible to the people that need the services than putting it somewhere on campus where it's harder to find and there's no where to park.",

Forcing them to step out of their bubble to develop more empathy for other people's lived experiences is part of preparing them for the job.",

It helps people that need it if it's easily found and isn't entangled inside the school's campus which could put people off. I think it's important to see that the building isn't just an extension of Baylor, but a part of the community.",

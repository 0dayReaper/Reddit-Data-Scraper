You will not get late fees or kicked out of class for missing payments however you will not be able to register for next semester. \n\n You can work your ass off this summer to pay for tuition and register super late for class. I usually had to register 3 days before class started for this exact reason.\n\nChin up, it sucks but you can make it happen.",

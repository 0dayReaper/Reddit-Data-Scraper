            "comment": "Alum here - class of 2016. My honest answer in hindsight is no, it\u2019s not worth it. I had a great time at Baylor and actually graduated debt free due to financial aid and scholarships, but I have friends still paying off tens (if not hundreds) of thousands in loans. I also make good money and am in a good place in my career, but I attribute none of that to Baylor or my undergrad degree. I\u2019m also saying this as someone who came from lower middle class and really couldn\u2019t afford Baylor. For those with \u201cdaddy\u2019s money,\u201d I suppose it doesn\u2019t matter the cost. But assuming you\u2019re financially responsible for your education, then no. \n\nThe Baylor name, especially outside of Texas, does little to boost you compared to many other cheaper and better schools. If you can get in, UT has an exceptional global reputation and equal or better quality of academics in almost any department. If you\u2019re from out of state, you may have top academic institutions in your state as well that will have a stronger and better network. The network is why the name of a school matters, and Baylor\u2019s just isn\u2019t THAT big. \n\nIf you just want the Baylor experience (small community, nice people, Christian school, etc) then sure, it\u2019s worth it. But you can find that niche anywhere.",

Of course, you\u2019re other options should be considered as well, as some other schools may offer a competitive education for a better overall price.",

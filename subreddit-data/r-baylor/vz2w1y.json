It was hard navigating my sexual identity at Baylor. Luckily, I found friends that were supportive. Like other students, I struggled as my family had cut some ties with me due to disagreements related to my sexuality. I had to find family at Baylor who would accept me. I want that opportunity to be there for others like me as well. Im happy to see that there are movements now to help make the campus more inclusive. We are still a ways away, but it\u2019s possible. Im now a doctoral student at the University of Houston and it\u2019s amazing seeing how much diversity and inclusion is here. LGBTQ campus groups really highlight the different types of people here and there are so many scholarships and opportunities for LGBTQ folks coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. Looking forward to seeing Baylor work towards being more inclusive because all students matter.",

So there's still a long way to go within the administration itself. It'll be interesting to see what happens if there are a lot of out and proud students but still a lack of openness for faculty and staff.",

This was a great read and it just reminds me of how much good I've seen in promoting queer rights on other Christian campuses. I am beyond proud of the work I've done with Gamma and the work other groups across the country have been doing, just makes me so happy. As someone who was deeply in the closet when I came here, I never thought I would make any sort of difference in anybody's lives, much less my own for hiding who I was. I can't wait to see what the future holds here at Baylor and beyond. \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08",

I, too, am excited to see what better futures incoming students will have at Baylor thanks to efforts of Gamma, alumni, current LGBT+ students and allies. Hopefully other universities, including those mentioned in this article, see progress as well.",

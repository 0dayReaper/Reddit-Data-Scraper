            "comment": "Current member here!\n\nIt is by far one of the best experiences you can possibly ask for from a marching band. We prioritize minimal rehearsal time with maximum results. We rehearse less than about 75% of bands out there, but still look and sound just as good, and any college band director would tell you that. We still do challenging shows, despite the limited rehearsal time, and our directors aren't afraid to try new things with us (see our Men's basketball national championship show from this year!)\n\nBeyond the music, the ensemble has an excellent atmosphere of excellence, support, energy, and family love. There's not a single section in the band that won't welcome you and treat you like family. The band directors really care about each member and care about us as people and not just musicians. \n\nBUGWB has been the most important part of my college career thus far. Marching band was my life in high school. I loved every moment of it, so I knew I wanted to go to a college that had a marching band, but I also wanted to go to a Christian school (I'm planning to go into ministry), so Baylor was really my only option in that regard. It has turned out to be the perfect fit for me though! It has fostered all of my favorite moments as a Bear, and has created a wonderful social group for me to be a part of. I honestly can't speak highly enough of it!\n\nBeing in BUGWB also opens to door to be apart of our other ensembles: Fall Ball Band (volleyball and soccer) as well as Courtside (basketball band), which are both tons of fun, and you can have the opportunity to travel with the volleyball and basketball teams in their respective NCAA tournaments!\n\nPlease ask any and all questions you might have. If I don't have an answer, I'll know where to direct you to find one!",

I participated in Bear Bands before I went to Baylor, and it was great to see what it was going to be like. You'll also get some of the stand tunes so you can play along with the band.",

            "comment": "I can't agree with this at all. I'll always appreciate Gerry and wish him the best, but he was a terribly tentative QB. You could literally see him second guessing himself on reads, he wasn't particularly accurate, rarely dropped dimes, and he had a tendency to limp-wrist throws. And he had a better overall receiving core than Shapen this year. \n\nRedshirt Freshman Shapen showed he was a better passer than 4th year developed Bohanon last year, and it was little surprise Shapen won the QB battle in the Spring.\n\nDoes that mean I'm happy with the QB play this year? Definitely not. Shapen has a tendency to Hero Ball, and has made some very notable mistakes. But he's also working with much less than Bohanon was last year. \n\nThis post reeks of \"our record was much better last year than this year, so clearly Bohanon was the better QB.\"",

You\u2019ll wait when everyone starts and you sprint! You get the full experience in your full uniform and you get directed by band staff to go to your spot. I think it\u2019s a unique and special experience both being in the band and running the line, getting some of the best seats in the house and playing super awesome music with your best friends during the game. PM me if you have anymore Baylor Golden Wave Band questions!",

Outside of that, though, I\u2019m not really sure what to look for \u2013 my room selection time slot is super early, but I don\u2019t have a roommate yet, so I\u2019m really wide open.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all for your suggestions! I somehow found a roommate about half an hour before my room selection slot, and he felt strongly about Martin, so I\u2019ll be going there.",

I suggest you look up what your actual freshman itinerary would probably look like regarding classes you are taking, and maybe reevaluate the  notion You should live close to that building freshman year. I suspect you find that almost every single course you are expected to take your freshman year will not be in Castellaw",

Anyone who intends to double major at Baylor should at least apply to the University Scholars program. I spent all my time at Baylor living in the HRC, something that didn't happen when I was there at almost any other dorm. It was a unique experience and the main reason I didn't transfer somewhere that wouldn't treat me the way Baylor is still treating me today.",

Went back for an MBA and now make well over six figures. I am also more valuable to a church if I ever get back into ministry.

(Several separate walled showers, toilets, etc) You have a mirror and sink in your room for basic hygiene stuff. \n\nThe environment is really communal and it helped me find friends when I arrived at Baylor. Like a 2 minute walk to Castellaw, which you will be at constantly (Check out the Lariat too if you need some extra cash when on campus), and a 3 minute walk to Penland Dining Hall, where you\u2019ll eat almost every meal freshman year. \n\nPM me if you have any other questions, just graduated in the Fall.",

            "comment": "closest to Castellaw is University House, Heritage House (that's fine arts btw), and Penland. All the dorms have been renovated except HRC, Allen, and Dawson. I think this summer Collins is getting renovated, but that doesn't matter for you. Honestly, most of your first two semesters will be gut courses and like maybe a few major-specific entry courses. Your possible religion courses may be anywhere around the campus, and the later courses for that will be in Tidwell. Also, Baylor is a small campus. You'll be surprised by how fast it takes to get from one place to the next. I lived in Allen, so I was far away from almost all of my classes. As of now, I'd pick your dorm based on the community it offers and if it's nice. University and Heritage are nice, Penland's aight but they have the strongest community on campus. Other nice halls include Brooks Flats, and Brooks Residential College.  You could also pick based on when you get to see which buildings your classes are in but I think that is much later. NORO, SORO, Martin, and Penland were all renovated so they are okay but their selling point is their community- it's really strong. All dorms mentioned have a good community so you can't go wrong with that, just others have different or stronger communities.",

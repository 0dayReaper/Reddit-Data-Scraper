    "postText": "Hello, I'm a Incoming Freshman to Baylor University and we have to select meal plans. I checked old reddit posts and they suggest only taking the 5 day meal plan. However, I was thinking if it would even be possible to cook/take out every saturday &amp; sunday of the entire semester and if I should just take the 7 day meal plan itself. (Especially since I don't think I'll have a car in my first semester on campus like many other freshmans). \n\nAlso, I was would appreciate it if you could suggest if I should buy a microwave and mini fridge for my room. (The Housing suggests there are microwave in each community for common use)",

I went to the dining halls as often as possible, but the dining dollars, and the inevitable meals off campus or ordering food mean its almost impossible to fully use the 7-day plan.\n\nAbout the microwave and mini-fridge, they are certainly very convenient and helpful but not necessary. If you need the extra cash don't get them, but I found both to be worth it",

It\u2019s definitely a manageable thing, but it *is* nice to have.\n\n If it\u2019s something where the money saved by taking a 5 day really counts though, it\u2019s not hard to supplement. You can always live the broke college-student life on the weekends &amp; keep a small stock of ramen, Mac n cheese bowls, or (if you\u2019re feeling *particularly* fancy) instant oatmeal. With the 5 day, you also get more dining dollars, so you can ration them a bit and strategically hit the SUB for CFA or panda or whatever else on the weekends. I haven\u2019t done the math, but I *thiiiiink* it should be somewhat viable. \n\nAlso protip: buy those mf [great value brand nutrigrain bars](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Fruit-Grain-Bars-Variety-Pack-41-6-oz-32-Count/764659276?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=0&amp;wl13=259&amp;adid=22222222278764659276_117755028669_12420145346&amp;wmlspartner=wmtlabs&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=m&amp;wl3=501107745824&amp;wl4=pla-293946777986&amp;wl5=1026741&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=8175035&amp;wl11=local&amp;wl12=764659276&amp;wl13=259&amp;veh=sem_LIA&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw5NqVBhAjEiwAeCa97YShe-DSCZuWPecGEsg3-uxkeekApyptM8drm6lpoDKcZoePGcKt2BoC8UwQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) if you ever hit up Walmart. You can get like, 32 or something stupid for 5$ which is pretty solid for a kid needing snacks on a budget. \n\n\nAnd a last casual tip: regardless of Mealplan, swipe that shit like it\u2019s candy. Midday break between classes, and need to do some work? Hit Memo for free coffee/drinks/cookies, snag a table &amp; plug in ur laptop. Memo\u2019s music is always pretty solid too, so not bad vibes.",

I hated the cafeteria food and thankfully after spring break was able to confiscate a car from my parents.   \n\nConsidering door dash, etc wasn't an option {heck we didn't even have email until I was a sophomore}, I cooked a LOT of hamburger helper and tuna helper in the little kitchenette down the hall on the floor and made enough for leftovers to last a few days. I could have cooked a lot more since I loved to cook even back then, but the little refrigerator in my room only had room for the butter and milk once I stuffed it full of the leftovers for the week.\n\nIf I had the options available now, with delivery services and microwaves in-rooms allowed... I don't think I'd get a meal plan at all.",

Realistically you\u2019d probably find more lesbians or gays in the Waco community, the two gay friends I made in Waco I both met through working together at Chuys. Wish I had a more helpful/optimistic answer, and it may vary by degree, but the only openly gay student I knew at Baylor was a guy with a design major (can\u2019t remember what focus exactly) who I was grouped up with in a business school marketing class.",

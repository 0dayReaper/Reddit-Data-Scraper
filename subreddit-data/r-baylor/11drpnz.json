            "comment": "The track program is pretty intense. Baylor offers club sports too though, and those are a little less intense. You can find a list here:\n\nhttps://www.baylor.edu/campusrec/index.php?id=927441\n\nI don\u2019t see track and field, but they do have a triathlon. I believe there\u2019s also an intramural track meet at some point (maybe even twice a year if I remember right). That\u2019s even less intense than club sports.\n\nFrom most to least intense it\u2019s: official sports programs &gt;&gt; club sports &gt;&gt; intramural sports. The official teams have scholarship players, mandatory practice, all of that. Club is still an organized team, but it\u2019s more for fun. There are no scholarships and I think most teams practice once or twice a week. They still compete against other schools though. Intramurals are for everyone, and you just compete against other students. Teams are pretty loosely organized, and most student orgs (frats and sororities) put together teams for every sport. Intramurals are pretty much just \u201cfor fun.\u201d",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm an incoming freshman this fall and i recently finished talking to my academic adviser and registered for my classes (I'm a bio major). I didn't thoroughly research all the profs and times for my classes in time for my meeting (i wasn't sure if the meeting was for registering or just discussing), so I'm not very happy with my schedule so far. I was wondering is there a way I can rearrange or change my schedule rn or am i required to go through my adviser to make any changes?\n\nAny advice or comments would be really appreciated. Thank you!",

However the community college is taking its sweet time to process my HS transcript since they want the GPA before seeing if I can enroll in intro to Chem. I had my meeting with my advisor yesterday and rn she has intro to Chem stuck on my schedule. I\u2019m guessing I don\u2019t have much time to swap out if I do manage to get enrolled later since I think my advisor told me I had to tell her today/tomorrow.",

I just wanted to not have to deal with labs and tbh I\u2019m not a big fan of chemistry myself so I\u2019d rather get it over with and done now. Plus with the more free time I\u2019d have for switching out Chem into psychological science or something I can use more of that time to study on other classes/perhaps try getting into reading for A&amp;P before second semester.",

To be candid, general chemistry is much harder to self-study for than psych or even A+P, especially if you haven't enjoyed it in the past. By skipping it, you're giving up the chance to develop a strong foundation of some of the most high-yield topics needed for nursing school/NCLEX.",

Write down all your options on paper and piece together a schedule sand backups (you can usually tell which ones have the potential to fill up based on how many seats are remaining). You don\u2019t have to notify your advisor to any changes. Use the codes (called CRNs I believe?) to sign up for a class, it\u2019s fastest to do it that way. Best of luck!",

By using this method, you can get good professors, and good class times ( never need to wake up early for an 8 am class)\n\nHere is a website where you can search for the classes professor: Bubook [http://www.bubooks.com/profrate.php](http://www.bubooks.com/profrate.php)\n\nI sincerely hope you can avoid horrible professors' classes because they are really ridiculous. Even if you work hard and spend a long time, these professors will still give you a pretty low grade.",

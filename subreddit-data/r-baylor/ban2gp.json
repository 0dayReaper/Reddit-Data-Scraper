Cox going down and the team getting back up after losing the lead took guts, especially with the pressure right back on late.\n\nI just happen to get double enjoyment out of this because I follow the DA Show. They had a women's bracket challenge bet, and the host's \"research\" led him to not take Baylor to Tampa as he had them pegged with a \"choker\" vibe on account of the past seasons since the last title.\n\nAs the creator of the worst bracket in that office pool, he must now go to the studio wearing a pink bunny costume, give treats to the sales department, wear the costume on the show (which has a TV simulcast) and eat a scoop of the spiciest salsa allowed on the open market, Death by Salsa, from the Pepper Palace at the Mall of America in Minneapolis. He doesn't get a tortilla chip this time. He has to eat that lump of hell using a marshmallow Peep. He lost last year and also had to eat the salsa. They stepped it up this year.\n\nSo not only did our women's team win it all, a national radio host gets to eat his words, a fat L, a Peep and burn his mouth all over again.",

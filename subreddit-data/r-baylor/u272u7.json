And\u2026if you don\u2019t attend the orientation you can\u2019t attend the camp. Housing for line camp starts the first day of the actual camp and since a 17 year old can\u2019t stay themselves in a hotel room and we live on the East Coast we are left with two choices\u2026kid doesn\u2019t go at all or I fly across the country with kid solely to stay in a hotel the first night. If the school wants to tout its R1 rating and attract out of state students having some sort of accommodations available for situations like this would be helpful. I\u2019m pissed and my kid is disappointed. I left a message with some office today. Hoping the information I received on the phone is incorrect and there is an option to dorm at the outset.",

Things have changed since then and I don't know by how much.\n\nIt's a good experience for what it is - a chance to meet some new people who are also going into a new life experience. It'll give you a short preview of what's to come. Unless you go to a residential college Line Camp, it's unlikely you'll interact with your Line Camp groupmates long-term. \n\nThey'll teach you the basics about the school's history and culture, including the school's songs, beginnings at Independence (with a trip there to see the original campus sites), important moments in history, key sites on-campus, Dr Pepper Hour, All University Sing, etc. If it feels a bit like indoctrination...it is. You don't have to buy in all the way, though you'll at least have your feet wet by the time you move in.",

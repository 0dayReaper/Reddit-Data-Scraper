    "postText": "Hey y'all, I desperately need to relet this 4x4 lease I have at the View on 10th Street. All the roommates are girls, and I'm offering rent for $850, which is $80 cheaper per month (I'll be absorbing the cost). Please message me if you're interested, and let your friends know! \n\nAlso if any of y'all have any suggestions on how I can find somebody to relet to asap I'd really appreciate it!",

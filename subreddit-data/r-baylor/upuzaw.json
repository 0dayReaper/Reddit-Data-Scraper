    "postText": "I'm a double major, and one of my majors is professional writing. I'm taking undergrad research and writing next semester, and based on my experiences in other professional writing courses, I'm assuming there's a couple of big projects in that class. For those who have taken it, or know someone who has, is it a group-project kind of class? Is it an individual project class? And do you have to research writing specifically, or would I be allowed to conduct research and writing in my other major?",

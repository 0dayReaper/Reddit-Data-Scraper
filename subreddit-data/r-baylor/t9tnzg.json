    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently got accepted into Baylor last week ED2.\n\nI also got awarded a 32k scholarship split over 4 years. I did not do that good in high school.\n\nWhile this is fine and dandy, I still realize the price tag for Baylor is still too big. Even if I were to get a 64k scholarship (split over 8 semesters), I would still be paying 54 k per year without help from FASFA or the CSS profile I completed.\n\nMy parents are poor (food stamps) and while I do believe that the FASFA and the CSS profile would help out substantially, I am willing to do whatever it takes to afford this school, with loans being the final resort.\n\nTo afford this school, should I apply for more scholarships and apply for a work-study program?\n\nThank you and sic'em.",

The school scholarships are highly dependent on you competing academically and if you cant keep that up you will lose the scholarship. IT IS NOT WORTH IT to get out of college with a bachelors and have 100k-150k+ in student loan debts. Especially because as you describe your family is in no way going to be able to help. \n\nIf you are dead set on baylor I would recommend you hit a community college and knock out the basic classes before transferring in. Save yourself tens of thousands of dollars doing that. It feels like Baylor has gotten even more crazy expensive since I graduated in \"12.",

            "comment": "I meant to reply to this a couple days ago. I was In a similar boat (Baylor '21). \nCame in broke with no family $ to help. \n\nA few big things, and if I think of more I will add to this. \n\n1. Do either of your parents have a bachelor's degree? If not, look into the First in Line Success Academy (FILSA). This is a generous scholarship for first gen college students (and also a great program in general). \n*they also have extra money put away for students in need. I have even gotten extra scholarship money in semesters where I really needed it. \n\n2. FAFSA. You mentioned this in your comment, have you already gotten your reward? This was a huge help for me, as I got thousands every semester from this. \n\n3. Apply for an LLC. I know the LEAD LLC has a scholarship of a few thousand every semester that was a big help for me. It's also a scholarship you can maintain all 4 years even after moving to your own apartment. You just have to take leadership classes which honestly are pretty helpful. And Dr. Wood rocks!\n\n4. Consider being an RA (CL at Baylor). Of course this is not a guarantee but it's also not that hard to become one based off my experiences with friends. \n\nBaylor wants you to graduate. They know it's expensive and have money put away to help people in need so you don't transfer or drop out. \n\nI did not have an academic scholarship at all (bad student in hs) and I left with a very reasonable amount of debt comparable to what I would've had at a state school. Look into your options. And explore the scholarships Baylor has that are either need based, or given through working for it (like the LLC and CL position). \n\nHope this helps. Here to answer any questions you have. Sic em bears!",

            "comment": "Congratulations on your acceptance to Baylor. I would suggest you to apply to more scholarships. You can also apply to the honors college and get scholarship through that. After you get here, if you do well relative to GPA, ECs and etc, you can win departmental scholarships. For example the medical humanities debakey scholars receive 10K in addition to their pre existing scholarship for the remainder of their semesters at Baylor. Also there are multiple other National scholars like Goldwater, Truman, Rhodes and etc that offer a good amount 10-15K. These ones are very competitive (about 200 scholars across the national/world receive this) and you can apply to them sophomore year and up.",

You can actually hold more than one work study at a time as long as you don\u2019t work more than like 20 hours a week.\n\nAdditionally, look into local scholarships in your high school, local community organizations, etc because you may have better luck than national ones or ones specifically for Baylor only.",

            "comment": "Take it from an engineer who has a relatively well paying job... The only reason I was able to pay off my student loan debt early was from interest pausing due to Covid and over a year paying straight to principal. I was expecting to keep paying them for another 3 or so years. More than a *decade* after graduating! And that was WITH scholarship assistance! \n\nDo NOT go into a mountain of debt for education. Unless you're choosing Baylor to be around ultra-religious people or some specific aspect of education you can't get anywhere else... The cost is not worth it.\n\nIn hindsight, I should've just gone to A&amp;M or Oklahoma or any other cheap fuckin school with a good reputation. Shit, A&amp;M is like 1/3 the price, likely has scholarships as well, and their engineering schools are great too. Plus, their alumni base, as cultish as it is, will hire you simply for being an Aggie. Stupid easy to find a job after school, especially in Texas.",

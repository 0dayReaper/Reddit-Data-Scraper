They take pest control very seriously and will fix the issue if there is one. But again I doubt you\u2019ll see another one.",

On top of that, this summer has been unseasonably hot, even for Texas. Giant heatwaves like that rile of the bugs because they're searching for food and water. I had problems with small roaches here and there in my apartment at the Domain. Called in the exterminator, also sprayed some RAID where I could. Problem seems to have fixed itself, especially with temperatures a tad lower than they were in July, which was like 100+ degrees constantly.",

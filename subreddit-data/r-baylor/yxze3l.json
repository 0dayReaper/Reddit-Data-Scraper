But unfortunately, here is my prediction:\n\nTCU 35\n\nBaylor 14\n\nThe line is -3?  If I were a betting man, I'd be all over that.\n\nThe K-State game did a number on me.  I thought the Bears were back after 3 straight solid wins, and primed to close out the season with 3 big wins, or at minimum, 2 wins (K-State and UT) and a good loss to TCU.  But the K-State game was awful.  Had everything to play for (Big 12 Championship berth), on their home field, and came out and did what they did.\n\nIf TCU were going to lose in the regular season, they'd have done it by now.  The Playoff Committee, in their obvious bias against the Big 12, would love nothing more than to rank TCU lower than #4, even lower than a 1-loss team such as their Golden Boy Alabama.  The fact that they haven't, means they think TCU is pretty legit.\n\nI just don't see TCU losing, unless Baylor somehow manages to play the best game of their season, and TCU is a little flat.\n\nEDIT:  I would have been wrong had I bet.  Was a much more competitive game from Baylor than I expected.  Did not expect Baylor to be in a position to win this game.  Kudos to the team for almost beating a top team.",

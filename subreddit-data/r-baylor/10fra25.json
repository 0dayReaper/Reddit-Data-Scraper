    "postText": "Hi, I'm a high school senior and was invited to the Invitation to Excellence. They provided me with some articles to read and the scenario of the event (disease outbreak), but I am a little confused on what the actual event is. Do I need to prepare a speech or presentation for my solution to the issue ahead of time? Is it a debate/conference? Thank you in advance!",

            "comment": "The invitation to excellence is listening to a lecture and engaging with the other students there on the topic. It's a useful way to learn what the Honors program is like and, tbh, is a great selling point on living in the Honors Residential College. The HRC is probably the best thing about my specifically Baylor experience (ask me about Waco more generally and I have a better answer) and I would highly recommend it if you're the kind of person who is potentially looking forward to preparing a presentation for a conference.",

Basically they\u2019ll put you in a small(ish) group of 7 or 8\u2019people and you\u2019ll just talk about the situation. I can\u2019t exactly remember but I believe they give you a sheet with some main points to talk through. Someone will be in there with you listening and taking into account your participation in the conversation and your preparedness. Then they\u2019ll take you to combine with another group and you\u2019ll put together some sort of presentation (it was a very short PSA video for me). It\u2019s not too serious and it\u2019s pretty fun.",

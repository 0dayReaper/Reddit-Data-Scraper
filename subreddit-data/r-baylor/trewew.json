    "postText": "Hi all,\nRecently got admitted to Baylor and SMU. Baylor seems to have a more quiet culture compared to SMU which I like. I am planning on taking computer science at both schools, but was wondering specifically about the cyber security concentration at baylor. How is it? My main goal is to be job ready at the end, and if regular cs is the way to go, then I\u2019d follow that path. If the cybersecurity concentration is the same and more, Then I\u2019d go with that. Sorry if this seems confusing, any help appreciated!",

            "comment": "They're both almost identical. The cybersecurity concentration basically has you use the CS electives towards cybersecurity classes and they add like two 1-credit labs and swap a computer architect course with a cryptology course. Both would get you job ready but the cybersecurity would tailor your experience towards cybersecurity as your elective courses are in that field. If you're interested in cybersecurity there is a team on campus and they have competed so that can be added experience to make you more desirable to employers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess the question is if you'd rather get a job in cybersecurity or some other field such as software engineering?",

Since, the courses are identical your first year and your second yr the only difference would be you taking those 1-credit labs. More than likely I'm after the first lab you'd know if its for you. If it is you can stay on the program but if not then just simply switch back into the regular CS degree. \n\nYou can also join the cybersecurity teams to get exposure your freshmen year to help you decide sooner if you're worried about it or just wanna hit the ground running. You can also meet more people to get a better idea if the industry is for you or not.",

Congrats on your acceptance!\n\n[Here](https://www.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?id=962953) are the degree flowcharts for the different concentrations offered in ECS. You\u2019ll notice that CyberSec and regular CompSci start with pretty much the same courses, so if you wanted to switch into or out of the concentration, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.\n\nThe function of the CyberSec is that it locks in the elective computer science classes that you would be taking. You\u2019ll still end up with the exact same BSCS degree, but you get to tell employers that you concentrated in Cybersecurity, which they LOVE.\n\nI will add that Baylor has a very active and nationally recognized Cybersecurity team that anyone is welcome to participate in. If you were unsure of whether or not you wanted to concentrate in cybersecurity, this would be a great place to start. Then you can make the decision after your first year of if you want to be in the concentration or not.\n\nOverall, you\u2019re still getting a degree in computer science, so you\u2019ll have a job lined up at the end if you make it out. I am certainly not some sort of cyber-genius and I\u2019m easily making 6 figures right out of college.\n\nLet me know if you have anymore questions!",

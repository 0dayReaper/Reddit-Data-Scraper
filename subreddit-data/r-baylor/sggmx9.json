    "postText": "Hey everyone. I'm a rising senior and Baylor right now is one of my top choices for college. It's got everything I'm looking for, good size, good sports, seems to have a great culture, and great faculty. The one problem is, it doesn't seem to have my desired major, civil engineering. I was wondering if anyone who goes/went here knows what people who want to major in civil engineering do or if I'm better off just looking at other colleges.\n\nThanks everyone.",

            "comment": "I studied Mechanical at Baylor.  They are pretty similar at their core and you could probably choose electives that are more related to Civil if you want to make that your focus.  I felt Mechanical was a good foundation that provided a lot of work options.  I did two summer internships in a more Civil Engineering role and felt I could have gone that route after graduation easy enough.",

ME and Civil are pretty common together in that job requirement.\n\nI had at least one offer for a Civil Engineering role. I believe that's pretty common for Civil and Mech engineers to be hired interchangeably at many places.  Most job applications say they require an engineering degree in x, y, or z engineering discipline. \n\nMy internship was doing engineering drawings for water treatment plants and they offered me a job.  My first job was aircraft structural design working closely with the Stress Engineers which was a mix of Civil and Mechanical.  I made my way into production engineering, then sustainment/MRB engineering for the same company.  Followed that up with Field Service Engineering Support and Failure Analysis in the Wind Industry, and now Systems Engineering back in Aerospace.  That was all in just under 10 years.  \n\nYour career can take you all over the place.  My opinion is that what matters in picking a school is to have a plan for where you want to start and make sure the school is a good fit for what you need to succeed as well as your personal beliefs, which for me, Baylor excelled in.  As long as they offer accredited engineering programs you'll be alright and there is always the option to tailor your skills with a Master's Degree or certification of some sort.",

            "comment": "I went through the MechE program at Baylor and am now working in mechanical/electrical role. Here are my thoughts:\n\n* The most objective way to think about this is to look at course catalogs for both [Baylor's MechE program](https://www.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?id=961316) (course catalog [here](https://www.baylor.edu/registrar/index.php?id=84879), flowchart [here](https://www.ecs.baylor.edu/doc.php/356675.pdf)) and [another school's CivE program (using TAMU as an example)](https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/civil-environmental/bs-structural-engineering-track/#programrequirementstext). Most of the differences appear in the junior and senior level elective courses. See what available elective courses excite you and which don't.\n \n* Another way to approach it is to look up entry level jobs you ideally would like to have and see what the degree requirements are. \n\n* I agree with /u/FrequentLandscape392 in that there's a lot of overlap between mechanical engineering and civil engineering. Both need to take some form of statics, dynamics, material mechanics, fluids, etc. I think the biggest thing you'd be missing out on by doing mechanical over civil is some of the geotechnical engineering/surveying, discussions on code and policy, traffic, concrete, etc (with more math classes and thermodynamics/heat transfer in their stead). In the worst case, you could probably easily transfer the first 2-3 years of mechanical engineering studies to a civil engineering program.\n\n* I do know of some MechE's I graduated with that ended up working for CivE firms. The biggest thing for CivE's is passing the FE exam en route to becoming a professional engineer. The [FE exam](https://ncees.org/engineering/fe/) can be taken in different disciplines, civil and mechanical being two distinct options. Review what is covered in both exams to help distinguish between the two.\n\n* I will say, personally, I do believe MechE gives you more options than CivE in case you change your mind about working in construction (don't discount that happening...I walked into college absolutely sure I wanted to go into automotive, walked out absolutely sure I wanted to work in aerospace, and now I'm happily doing neither of those things). CivE is a very broad field with plenty of variety (structural, hydrology, earth sciences, etc.), but it does sort of push you into construction/geotechnical work. MechE gives you more opportunity to jump to something even further outside of that, like automotive or aerospace. If you *know* you want to be in construction, then CivE is the way to go.\n\n* I've been in the workforce about 5 years now. Almost everything that I use in my job daily were things I learned while working at the job...that is to say, most of the specific knowledge you will need to be successful you will pick up in the workforce. As long as you're within the right physics area with your degree (mechanical physics, not electrical or chemical), I believe that a civil engineering firm will happily take you at graduation and start training you in the specifics of that field. Engineering school, on top of teaching you things that are specific to your field of engineering, teaches you a way of thinking and how to approach problems, which is transferable across engineering disciplines.\n\nI hope that helps some. Ultimately, as long as you go to an ABET accredited school (which any established university will be) and you go somewhere where you think you can be successful, I think you'll do just fine. I know all of this sounds scary now, but I promise you that when you're a few years into your career, you will look back and wonder why you ever worried.",

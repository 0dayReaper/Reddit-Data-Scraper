    "postText": "I have a group I met at the roommate mixer, but there\u2019s people that are applying to get into the HRC for the first time as sophomores and I might need another group. I\u2019m transferring to Texana as part of the Memo Reno and because I\u2019m still interested in living on campus. Worst case scenario is that I get matched randomly, but it would be nice to have something planned. \nIf anyone is in the same boat as me, feel free to request a chat and we\u2019ll go from there. In the meantime I\u2019ll wait for the first group to get back to me or my CL.\nThanks :)",

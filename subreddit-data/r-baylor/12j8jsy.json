Let\u2019s just say that the people who got me to go back to church and become very religious ended up being some of the most spiteful, judgmental, hypocritical, and just plane fake people I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. It has kind of permanently turned me off from dealing with people who are very religious and made me very jaded from getting involved with church ever again. I\u2019m not agnostic or anything but I doubt I will ever be able to return to a church ever again. \n\nIt\u2019s sad. I wanted Baylor to help me grow spiritually and instead it has left me permanently scarred. I hope that doesn\u2019t happen often because it really does suck.",

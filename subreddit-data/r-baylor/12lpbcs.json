I\u2019ve always wanted to go to this school but life happened and I wasn\u2019t able to go straight out of high school. I\u2019m 23 now and I got the Distinction Award for about 12k and I\u2019m assuming after the need based scholarship and fasfa grant I\u2019ll have to accept anywhere from 20k-30k in loans per year. I\u2019m currently wanting to go for Nursing to become an RN and eventually become a CRNA. If you were in my position would deem the school worth it considering the education, name value, medical track, etc?",

That makes my app stand out. I was told by the boss at my current job that he wanted to interview me based on the \u201cBaylor\u201d on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \n\nAs a crna and even if you stay as an rn you\u2019ll not be in debt for long so long as you\u2019re responsible. I had no trouble paying back my loans quickly. \n\nYour mileage may vary of course but it was worth every penny for me.",

Job prospects will only continue to trend upwards. Hospitals and clinics are facing staffing shortages across the country, especially in the Midwest. Even outside of Texas, Baylor has a positive reputation for graduating great nurses/healthcare providers.",

Professors do not like giving out As, and Bs aren\u2019t easy either. To make things tougher, we use the +/- system, which means for some classes you need a mid 90s to get an A. Just so you realize how tough that is, imagine a very difficult exam with 20 questions, way tougher than any exam you had in high school. You can only miss one question. Miss four and your grade is toast. Class averages are around 65% for freshman STEM classes. We are near the end of the semester and in some classes half the students have dropped. Tough pill to swallow considering the cost of tuition.",

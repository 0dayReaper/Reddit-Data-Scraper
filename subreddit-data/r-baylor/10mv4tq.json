It\u2019s also 1/4 the size of Baylor so your classes will be smaller, besides the introductory lecture hall ones. \n\nThe degree path is much more liberal arts focused and you get a lot of different options to meet each requirement whereas at Baylor there are many requirements that only have a single course that can satisfy that requirement. \n\nDallas is a lot more fun than Waco but Waco is getting better each year. \n\nSMU is also $15-20k more than baylor on a yearly basis so you might end up spending more going there even if you have a larger scholarship. \n\nIf you want to be an investment banker - SMU is better than Baylor, but if you are not attempting to go into a very competitive field like IB I do not think there is much difference between Baylor and SMU.",

If you\u2019re coming in as a freshman and have a full ride I 100 percent believe that Baylor is a great choice. It was my dream college going up and tbh I only applied because I thought it would be funny if I got accepted\u2026 and then I got accepted. \n\nIt was weird for me there as I definitely do not fit the bill as a Baylor student. I am Hispanic, eye brow slit, bald faded, and tattoos. Therefore, I do believe I am not viewed the same as say a white male Christian student. However, I did not come to this school to be make lots of friends go on study abroad and or even experience the college life. I am here to learn and go home. So it does not bother me the way I am viewed because I see a lot of copy and paste of the same looking people all over campus. I\u2019m in loads of debt that the school did claim that would help with and if I\u2019m being honest, that shit is not true. The Rec center is bad and so is the dining hall food. Again I say\u2026 if you are only here to get a great education then YES Baylor is a great option. If you want the full experience I strongly suggest looking in to other schools. I read that you\u2019re a CS major I\u2019d look into UTSA personally.",

            "comment": "You should always apply to a bunch of schools. If you want to go to Baylor, you should. But you shouldn't go anywhere because it is your only option.\n\nROTC claims to pay for your education, but you really have to dive into what the asterisk on that payment will be. Will they cover all your tuition, book costs, room and board, and spending money? Generally not. My tuition was fully covered by scholarships, but just paying for room and board is why I graduated with $50k in student loans. Many of the \"benefits\" of ROTC programs are actually just in the form of the paycheck you get after college by working in the military, just like a normal job. In my mind, the program paying for things is not necessarily worth what you miss out on by not being able to be a normal college student doing normal college things (not to mention the profound moral implications). If you could afford a cheaper school without joining ROTC, I would go there myself.\n\nI have a lot of mixed feelings about Baylor. I made many dear friends there, I got to explore Europe and meet my wife because of my relationships with Baylor professors who worked magic to make it free for me, and I got my first job based on the fact that I graduated from the honors program. But I would have made dear friends anywhere I went, probably would have still gotten to do a semester abroad with great professors, and had connections that got me a different first job. I am happy for the particularities of my life, but it wasn't fate that those particularities happened at Baylor and couldn't have happened elsewhere.\n\nI'll say that the particular negatives I experienced were unique to Baylor. I was harassed for being different. I couldn't be everything God made me to be. I was left on the outside of many things because I didn't fit in. \n\nBut, on the other hand, those particular difficulties very much so made me who I am today. I wish I had been freer to explore the ideas I am only now exploring, but I wouldn't have had the same foundation without it. My ability to speak with people very different from me comes from surviving at Baylor.\n\nBut, on my third invisible hand, perhaps the person I would be having gone somewhere else would have been just as cool as I am but without so much debt. Rethinking these things is really hard. There was a lot of good at Baylor, but I think there was too much bad for me to say unequivocally that other people should go there. \n\nTL;DR: If you're a male white Christian middle-class conservative, you'll be fine at Baylor, but probably in debt. If you're not, I think there are places that will challenge you to grow without quite so much trauma. And above all, don't let the military manipulate you into anything.\n\nEdit: the autocorrect was wild.",

I'm a history major myself, and I changed my major four times \u2014 added and dropped even after I added history, but once I added that, it hasn't changed for nearly three years now. A truly wonderful department that genuinely cares about their students, their fields of research, and their colleagues. While Baylor isn't known for history in the ways that Ivy Leagues are, most of the professors are actual leading experts in their fields who have worked with, been advised by, or befriended major historians in their fields.\n\nObviously, I can't speak to STEM, but I was a lit major for a bit and a professional writing major, as well as (briefly) a journalism major. Baylor's a lot stronger in the humanities than they're given credit for.",

It took me a while to find my niche in college, and I started the semester before covid hit the world, so I genuinely was thinking about transferring. Decided to wait it out a semester, during which time I was finishing up the pre-reqs in my major, and I swear, that is the only reason I stayed. Ended up making most of the best friends I have now in the spring semester of my sophomore year (still very, very dear friends with three of those people), and the following two years, I was able to take history classes I loved with great professors. You'll probably need to take some history, especially if you're going through ROTC, and I truly believe that department is the hidden gem of the university.\n\nI'm also a secondary major in the English department, and honestly, I hate it there, but I have too many credits to drop that major now. Any university will be great as long as you find your people, and I happened to find mine through the history department. I can't speak to the STEM fields, though, only the humanities.\n\nEdit: to be clear, the English department also has wonderful people. I simply much prefer my history studies to my English studies",

I\u2019m in my senior year right now, and over the last 3 and a half years I\u2019ve seen a lot of the ways that the school treats itself like a business rather than an educational institution. \nFor a few example, in what seems like an attempt to maximize income from tuition, Baylor accepted way too many students the last two years and have had to rent out the entirety of a hotel across the highway to house freshman. Baylor keep closing more just-off-campus free parking every year, forcing students to buy on campus parking passes, which they still sometimes oversell. They often change the course requirements of each class which forces them to pay more. It just doesn\u2019t feel like a place where the administration is committed to caring about the students. It did when I was a freshman. But it doesn\u2019t any more.\n\nThis IS just my experience and perspective though, and it might not be other people\u2019s.",

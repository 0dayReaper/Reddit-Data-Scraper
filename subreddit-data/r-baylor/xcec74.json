            "comment": "Depends on if you want to commute or not. You won't find perfection at any of the complexes. But I live in Park Place and have visited most of the apartment complexes prior to signing at Park Place. The commute at Park Place and the luxury apartments are really nice, but some of the rooms really need some help and the management is horrible. If you are alright with taking a shuttle, most of the living in the URSA area is fairly nice... but once again, its hard to beat the luxury and amenities of Park Place",

Bandera Ranch and Aspen Heights are also places I know that rent homes/townhomes, but I don\u2019t know what the living experience there is. My biggest recommendation is to read the reviews.",

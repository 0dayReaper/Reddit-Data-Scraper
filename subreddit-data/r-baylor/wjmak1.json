    "postText": "Hi! For this fall semester I\u2019m going to be a sophomore but I was a little nervous with my upcoming classes and stuff.\n\nI\u2019m taking molecular cell biology with Professor Abel and Ochem with Zinke. Also taking Christian Heritage with Professor Wells who I know nothing about. \n\nI\u2019m thinking about getting a job this semester or a work study or something and I\u2019m really worried about if I\u2019ll be able to manage my time. Last semester kicked my butt so I\u2019m super nervous about this semester.\n\nDo you guys have any tips on how to handle these profs? Or how to manage your time with work?",

Don\u2019t slack off on the pre class homework, do it well and you\u2019ll have a strong foundation during the lecture. For tests, go through the learning objectives for each lecture and make sure you can write at least a 3-4 sentence paragraph for each one.",

I've had one of their people come talk to my classes for several years now, and they do good work. They're happy to sit down one-on-one and help you figure out your day. \n\n[https://www.baylor.edu/case/](https://www.baylor.edu/case/)",

            "comment": "Cell bio and organic chemistry are definitely harder than your typical freshman classes. If you struggle with time management, I would avoid working/choose a position that allows you to study on shift, i.e working the SUB, Moody, etc. I wrote some advice a while back in response to some DMs about Ochem:\n\n\nOchem/Zinke FAQ:\n\n**How are Gen Chem and Orgo different?**\n\nJames Amherst covers this better than anybody on his [site](https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2010/06/28/gen-chem-and-organic-chem-how-are-they-different/). \n\n**I'm lowkey terrified of this class, should I study ahead?**\n\nNo. Enjoy your break. The first module of Ochem is Chem 1 review: Formal Charges, Bond Theory, Atomic Orbitals, Physical Properties, etc. Yes it gets harder but you will be eased into things.\n\n**I'm signed up to take Zinke--do you have any experience with him?**\n\nPlenty of people love Zinke, plenty others struggled in the class. I'm in the camp that thinks he's great! Check out what others think on [BUBooks](http://www.bubooks.com/profdisplay.php?profid=2382).\n\n**What materials do I need to buy?**\n\nBuy the Baylor editions of the Klein textbooks in the Bookstore--it's a softcover packaged with the answer book which has room to work through the problem sets &amp; additional questions and is newly updated. You have to do these problem sets if you want to do on this class. The 4th edition differs from the 3rd, not by a lot, but enough. Molecular model kits are optional, but if you need one there are cheaper molecular model kits online. If you're cheap like me, just ask the SI's if you're really having trouble, or look up structures on PubChem.\n\n**What does doing well mean in Orgo?**\n\nThink about what your goals should be for the class. If you're pre-professional student chances are your priorities are: 1) Get an A. 2) Get a recommendation letter. 3) Learn the material. Of the 3, the 3rd is the hardest and requires the most time and effort. \n\n**What's the best way to study for Orgo?**\n\nPractice problems. Do them as you read through the textbook and do the recommended ones at the end of each chapter. Your enjoyment and understanding of Orgo is proportionate to the number of practice problems you are doing. Orgo is qualitative/conceptual, and learning these concepts is a discrete process. Make an effort to understand everything in Zinke's notes: anything in them is testable material. At first, they will look like gibberish. It is up to you to use supplemental texts and practice problems to master the concepts. If you can learn the material, you will get an A. Zinke's tests are very fair.\n\nAdditional Resources: I found Klein's supplemental texts to be invaluable: [*Organic Chemistry as a Second Language*](https://libgen.is/search.php?req=organic+chemistry+as+a+second+language&amp;lg_topic=libgen&amp;open=0&amp;view=simple&amp;res=25&amp;phrase=1&amp;column=def). [masteringorganicchemistry] (https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/) is a great resource for comprehensive explanations. \n\n**What do you think is that main reason that people do badly?**\n\nThe most common mistake is to convincing yourself that you don't need to study as much as you know you should. Even worse is not admitting that you're struggling. Reach out for help  The plethora of free resources available at Baylor is an incredible privilege:  SI, Sid Rich tutoring, prof office hours. Use them! \n\n**How much time should I expect to spend on Orgo?**\n\n2-5 hours of out-of-class work for every hour in class. Personally, I stopped going to lectures a few weeks into Orgo 1 and used that time for practice problems. Keep yourself accountable but allocate time for other classes/free time. When you aren't spending time on OChem, don't be worrying about Ochem.",

IMO a physical textbook to mark up in is a necessity: you have to be drawing out the structures and mechanisms as you read about the concepts. Everything else you can find for free online. \n\nHere's the study plan that worked for me: Read Zinke's notes up to current lecture-&gt;**Understand** corresponding concepts with \"Organic Chemistry as a Second Language\"-&gt;Use Klein main textbook to master **applying** concepts to problems. 70% of ochem studying should be this last step. \n\nLast tip: Ochem SI is many times more valuable than actual lecture, and is where you actually get taught organic chemistry. Really try to go to all the sessions. Zinke is very close to his SIs and tells them what topics show up on upcoming exams. \n\nGood luck! It may seem like a lot but you got this!",

Comparable to scriptures, which I assume you\u2019ve been through. \n\nFor difficult classes, the most important thing is to write out everything you need to do. Just make a detailed to-do list. I also found getting up daily to start at 8:00 am greatly reduced the pressure on me. \n\nFor work, that\u2019ll be a personal decision. You may start the semester, see how it goes, and get a job in a few weeks. Or you can get an easy job like OA with CLL and get paid to sit there and study.",

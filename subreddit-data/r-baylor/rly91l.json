            "comment": "Short answer: Pretty unlikely. Baylor only went online for the end of the Spring 2020 semester, but has been in-person since then. Sometimes with adjustments -- testing, masks, changes to the semester schedule -- but steadily working back toward \"normal.\" We'll see what spring looks like, exactly, but I'd be surprised to see Baylor go completely back online at any point. (I assume that's what you meant by \"close.\")",

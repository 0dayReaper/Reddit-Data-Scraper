            "comment": "There is an audition required. It\u2019s two contrasting monologues, or a monologue and a song if you sing. \n\nThe department is really tight-knit and has a communal feeling to it, with its own events and student society. Everyone is on a first-name basis, including professors, and they do a good job of creating a sense that everyone in the department are colleagues. It is also one of the most literary and academically intensive BFA\u2019s in the country. The curriculum is heavy on history, literature, analysis, and skills that are auxiliary to acting.",

Acting and design gigs almost certainly won\u2019t pay the bills right out of the gate when you graduate, so having the competence in a scenic/lighting/costume shop necessary to get overhire work is terrific.\n\nI met a lot of brilliant actors with terrific training out of SMU when I was active in the Dallas theatre scene, but they were competing with the best graduates from Baylor and UNT as well, and there are only so many parts going around for youthful-looking performers. The big perk for us is that SMU and UNT put almost no focus on the technical production aspects of their curricula, which means that we\u2019re the ones getting our faces seen in the company. That\u2019s why there are a relatively large supply of Baylor grads on staff at the major theaters in DFW, namely DTC, Watertower, and T3. \n\nBut also, as someone who graduated with a math major, I\u2019d take Complex Variable Theory or Advanced Calc again any day over doing Theatre History 3 again with Jortner. It absolutely improves what we bring to the table, and Jortner\u2019s great, but that class was brutal.",

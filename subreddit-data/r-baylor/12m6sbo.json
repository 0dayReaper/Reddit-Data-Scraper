I would let the answers to those guide you.\n\nIt's also sometimes worth picking your end point and working backwards. \"This is what I want. How do I get there?\"\n\nIt's your life, and it's your future. It's ok to sit in a quiet place and think about it for as long as you need to. Since money doesn't seem like it'll be an issue, the path you think will be best for you, is probably the right choice. Plus, not that I think anyone in this sub will purposely point you in a direction with malicious intent, I would also like to say that, twenty years from now, you're going to be very greatful you didn't let Reddit decide your fate.",

I have a buddy who's a literal computer genius and they've told me it's the mother of wash-out degrees (incoming class of \\~400, graduating class of \\~25 in CS). If Drexel has a similar program, I'd recommend it over Baylor.",

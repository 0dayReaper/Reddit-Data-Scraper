Each week we\u2019re making a popular regional item for the \u201cgame of the week.\u201d This week the selected game of the week is Baylor vs BYU. What\u2019s a unique tailgate food y\u2019all like to have? Doesn\u2019t have to be a smoked entree, last week we did boiled peanuts (but we smoked them) for Georgia!\n\nThanks in advance!",

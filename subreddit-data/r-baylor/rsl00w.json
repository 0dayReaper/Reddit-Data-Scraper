Ole Miss' defense has improved throughout the year, but I think we have a strength vs weakness in the run game on that side of the ball. \n\nThe strength on strength of this game is Matt Corral vs our defense. He will be the best QB we faced all year and he can gain yards with his legs. Luckily we have speed at the LB position to keep a spy on him. I think we will see that we can bottle up their run game but we are going to see corral get his yards through the air and he will have some demoralizing first down gains with his legs. \n\nUltimately I think our offense's ability to sustain long drives will win this for us.

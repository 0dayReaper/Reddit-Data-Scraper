It is unknown when the Grease Pit was born or named, but it existed before I came, and it will exist long after I leave. It beckons us, providing momentary abatements to our cravings and soothing our hunger on long nights out \u201cstudying\u201d after the dining halls have closed. Despite [criticism](https://baylorlariat.com/2022/04/12/student-living-should-be-easier-healthier-in-waco/) and [attempts](https://baylorlariat.com/2021/03/30/destruction-of-4th-5th-street-bridge-causes-problems-for-students-faculty/) to dissuade Baylor students from attending Grease Pit establishments, every self-respecting Baylor student comes around to love the Grease Pit. The Grease Pit needs the Baylor student, and the Baylor student needs the Grease Pit. \n\nSo, I have created an objective and totally-not-biased tier list of every grease pit establishment you may ever encounter as a Baylor student. Any location that could be described as a \u201clocal restaurant\u201d is not a part of the Grease Pit conglomerate and thus is ineligible for evaluation. What makes me qualified you may ask? Well in my three and a half years at Baylor I approximate that I\u2019ve consumed more than 100,000 calories from the Grease Pit which I would be more than willing to wager is more than any of you. Disagree? Well, go ahead and try to prove me wrong with your own tier list. [Here is the template I used.](https://tiermaker.com/create/baylor-grease-pit-tier-list--15160665)",

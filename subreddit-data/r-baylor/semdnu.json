    "postText": "Hi!!!, I was admitted and I have a few questions. Primarily is the Environmental Health Major courses similar to the premed and MCAT requirements\n\n[Environmental Health Science | College of Arts &amp; Sciences | Baylor University](https://www.baylor.edu/artsandsciences/index.php?id=72442)\n\nBaylor was one of my top choices, I want to do premed and then go to a T20, and am seriously considering Baylor. I have a few questions that I couldn't find in the previous premed posts.\n\n1. How is the Environmental Health major specifically at Baylor University, do the courses coincide with MCAT\n2. How are the teachers are they supportive (Internships/Research/Shadowing) and How is the grading\n3. Is the overall Waco area good(safety) and how is the food\n4. Should I pick Baylor over TAMU, UTD, Rice, Trinity and other good premed schools in Texas",

            "comment": "I can't speak for the environmental science department specifically, (I'm a current HNR neuro/pre-med major) so I'll leave question 1 for someone else.\n\nBut trust me, you won't have any trouble finding professors who run research labs in the college of arts and sciences, in and out of your major's department. Most professors are willing to take in students who make contact with them and express interest in their research. Keep an eye out for advertisements for open labs posted around the BSB, if you choose to attend, or pay attention in class because most professors who run a lab love to mention their research at least once and if it's something you may also be interested in, they're probably someone to approach after class or during office hours. \nIf you're doing pre-med though, I'd say research probably isn't where you're going to want to focus most of your efforts. In terms of shadowing/internships, most of those can be achieved through involvement in pre-health organizations on campus or carefully checking the weekly pre-health letter which will be sent through your email and contain links to apply to internships the university thinks will be a good match for the majority of students. Baylor will also set up a handshake account for you where you can attach a resume and receive more specific offers from interested employers or internship programs. You can also apply to additional internships through Handshake. (I recently applied to a summer internship at BCOM through there for example). In terms of the pre-health organizations, most require a certain number of hours of involvement to be an active member and each usually have pre-existing agreements with clinics or programs within Waco that allow their members to volunteer. (I've been in or heard of organizations that have opportunities for hospice work, clinical work, mission work, triage work, memory care homes volunteering, etc.) \nBaylor also offers a mandatory pre-health class called foundations of medicine that requires you to volunteer, join organizations, and go to events around campus to start you off right in your pre-health journey in your first semester. It's a great networking opportunity as well, as it's led by pre-medical upperclassmen who usually can help with advice and guidance. Baylor also offers a non-mandatory class that literally creates shadowing/volunteering opportunities for you in Waco and blocks off time for you every week to go and participate in them as your grade. That class is probably better taken as an upperclassmen however, or at least when you have a car. \nGrading depends on the prof. When you register, use BUbooks.com to check out ratings and see how other students did in the past. (The website looks shady on the browser, but I promise it's a Baylor lifeline).\n\nI won't lie, Waco sucks. Roads aren't great, city isn't great, and you can probably see and do everything to do in Waco within your first week on campus. Lots of people drive up to Dallas or down to Austin for weekend fun. If you stay in Waco on your weekends, there's a few good places to hear live music, and the restaurant scene isn't that bad. There's also restaurants on campus that you can use dining dollars to pay for, or use your meal plan. \n\n I picked Baylor over all of those schools. If you have a decent application, you'll probably get a good sized scholarship from Baylor anyways. I applied and got into Rice, UT Austin, A&amp;M, etc and Baylor's scholarship offer outdid every other offer I received by far. In saying that, choose the school that is right for you and your ambitions. Don't just let someone on the internet tell you what to do. Tour all of your options, do some research, and you'll end up exactly where you're meant to be. \n\nAnyways, Good luck in your college journey and if you have any other questions about Baylor or the college process, feel free to shoot me a DM! I tried to keep it brief here, and I can definitely share more to answer questions 2-4 if needed. Hope this helps!",

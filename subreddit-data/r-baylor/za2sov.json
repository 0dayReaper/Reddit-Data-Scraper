Shapen is going to be running for his life behind a relatively inexperienced OL, and frankly, that's better than throwing a promising recruit like Novosad to the wolves.\n\nRBs are good, just need to keep Reece healthy.\n\nWRs will need to grow hands between now and the '24 season when Novosad will presumably take over. OL will have development time between now and then as well.\n\nI hope Randolph gets moved to EDGE because he's an absolute physical freak and I feel like he has so much more potential there than as a 6'7\" LB.",

My 10yo daughter could have caught it.\n\nHe wasnt starter material yet and didnt want to wait his turn through development.\n\nTransfer portal gonna be goofin up cfb hereon letting these kids switch on a dime.\n\nBrewer fliped multiple times, GB didnt want to sit either. \n\nNow maybe aranda gets a solid defensive coordinator with a stellar resume and we return our defense to prior year level. I think brewer will get better on the other side of the ball with a year of good live education on the grid iron.",

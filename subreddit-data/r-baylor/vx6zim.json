            "comment": "I have mixed feelings on this.\n\nOn the one hand, if I was trying to cook my own meals all three years at Baylor, I would not have been able to devote nearly the same amount of time to extracurriculars, studying, dating, socializing, church, and therapy necessary to survive. The semester I lowered my meal plan was my hardest, not because I had hard classes, but because I was just literally not getting enough calories in the day.\n\nOn the other hand, thanks to generous scholarships, I only paid for room and board for two years at Baylor. I just made a huge payment that, without interest, would have paid off all of my student loans. But due to interest, I still owe as much as I took out. \n\nIt ends up being a personal decision, but I would probably err on the side of being fed.",

Then when I moved to an apartment I was able to cook all my food and it was much better. \n\nAlso do some math on the per-meal price. When I was looking at it it was actually cheaper to buy individual swipes than a meal plan (and it was like $11/swipe).",

            "comment": "I lived off campus. To save commute or meal preparation time and maximize your time around other students or with friends, you should get at least a small meal plan in which you can eat breakfast at home and then plan on having every weekday lunch and possibly every weekday dinner on campus.\n\nIt will be more convenient to stop in to Penland (or wherever) to eat than it will be to go home, eat, and then drive or walk back to Baylor.\n\nYou might also eat healthier this way because you will be less inclined to eat fast food in a pinch.",

While I love to cook, there were many times (during finals and big test weeks) where my food intake was drastically lower because I had no time/willingness to cook or meal prep. Cooking for yourself will always be cheaper but you honestly can\u2019t beat the convenience of being able to swipe into penland and not have to think twice about what you\u2019re gonna eat for lunch. Swipes also open up the possibility of having lunch with friends/others on campus for lunch and was something I frequently had to say no to because I didn\u2019t have swipes.",

Also, why is it so different from my last university? (I know it\u2019s a Christian uni)\nAre the 12 art experiences things I can do on campus? \nDo they have regular art experience events that are entertaining?",

            "comment": "I'm not exactly sure if degree requirements are fully compulsory for transfer students. It would be a tough sell to require 12 Creative Arts Experiences in a truncated timespan. Baylor requires participation in various classes/events because interdisciplinary education/exposure develops well-rounded undergrads. \n\nChapel is a longtime Baylor tradition, and functions to allow for students to explore (mainly Christian) spirituality and develop interpersonal bonds with peers. Sometimes there are guest speakers, and the hardest part about the class is showing up and staying awake. I believe Baylor now offers online sections, and two semesters are required. \n\nLifetime fitness is a one semester requirement. Baylor offers a wide expanse of classes from beginner bowling to advanced rock climbing with a focus on self-improvement as well as how exercise is beneficial to mind and body. Take the infamous \"rest and relaxation\" if you want to cheese the class, or challenge yourself with the bowling courses which I have always heard great things about. \n\nCreative Arts Experiences are exactly as they sound. Everybody has to attend two events from each of the following categories: Art, Film, Music, Theatre, and Literature/World Cultures. In-person/online offerings are offered year round, but people put these off and get in trouble with Baylor registry because the requirement is a stringent one. The events themselves are hit-or-miss, but some of them are actually really cool. Off the top of my head: watching *Parasite* inside a packed classroom, learning a traditional Native American war dance, getting a guided tour in an art museum about the psychology of advertising. \n\nChristian Scriptures and Heritage are also 3 hour, semester-long courses that may be a requirement. These are cool classes if you are open to participation and contemplation, regardless of your religious affiliation. A constant theme of Baylor's curriculum is that although the fundamental mission is Christian-led, the real aim is to give students exposure to other cultures, religions, attitudes, social demographics, etc. It is up to you to decide if these experiences re-affirm your spirituality, or the opposite.",

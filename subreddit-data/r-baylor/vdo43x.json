Entering the year, most ost of us thought the upcoming 2022 draft was top-heavy. Some even thought it could be the worst draft in recent memory. As usual. Things change, players develop and the next crop of NBAers enthralls us all of a sudden. Frankly, the 2022 class is deep and loaded with high-floor guys who offer positional flexibility. Exhibit A: Sochan, a 6-foot-9 defensive chess piece with a 7-foot wingspan and motor/flare comparable to a young Dennis Rodman.

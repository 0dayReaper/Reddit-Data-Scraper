    "postText": "Both Baylor\u2019s Class of 2024 and 2025 were incredibly high with the \u201825s being the highest of all. I think there were about 600-700 extra enrolled students in this year\u2019s freshman class. \n\nWith that being said, if you are getting deferred or rejected, don\u2019t take it too personally. I am sure you were all a great fit for Baylor, but I think Baylor is accepting a bit less amount of people this year to reduce their enrollment since it was a hassle this year to provide housing and etc for freshmen. \n\nThat\u2019s just my two cents. What do y\u2019all think about this (the other Baylor students)?",

            "comment": "I got rejected when I first applied as a freshman because I wasn't a stellar student in high school. I then decided to transfer in a year later. It's certainly not a big deal to get rejected. Everyone seems to panic at the thought of transferring or not going to the same school for four years. It's an expectation that's growing increasingly detached from reality as more students realize that there are other options out there.\n\nBaylor has always been an exclusive school with a pretty low acceptance rate. It certainly doesn't surprise me that, in the wake of the COVID hysteria, they're beginning to revert to pre-pandemic rates of acceptance. \n\nThank God I came in as a sophomore living at an apartment. The freshman housing situation would've been hell.",

That said I do think they are trimming this year because 2025 broke the enrollment models. In person classes coupled with a Basketball championship and now with R1 status, Baylor is a pretty unique school so I'm sure applications are up and that acceptance rate is going down.",

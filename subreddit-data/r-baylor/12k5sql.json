I wonder if I can compare the tuition to another college I got accepted to that is way cheaper and maybe have Baylor match it or get close to it. Wild thought but would be awesome if possible",

But the cost has to be there for me to consider. I can\u2019t pay 50K or whatever the amount they expect. 20Kish would be possible and I would really have to consider it but I doubt I get it that low. Hoping for the best \ud83e\udd23",

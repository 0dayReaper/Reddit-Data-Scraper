Worth a try!",

When I was there they specifically said student on them and you had to show your student ID at the gate. \n\nAs for \u201calumni tickets\u201d I had season tickets through the school. Everyone else I knew who didn\u2019t bought theirs through https://baylorbears.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetGroupList?groupCode=FB&amp;linkID=baylor&amp;shopperContext=&amp;caller=&amp;appCode=. I believe this is just through Baylor\u2019s ticket office and they will start releasing single game tickets closer to the season starting.",

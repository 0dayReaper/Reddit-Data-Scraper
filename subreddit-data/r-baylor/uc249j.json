    "postText": "Hey\n\nI've applied to Baylor 2 weeks ago (since they're doing the rolling admission stuff) and I want to know whether I can get admission or not. I didn't do well in high school (GPA-3.1) and I'm doing my first year, first semester BSc degree at Monash University in Down Under. I applied for studying public health and didn't apply for financial aid. Also is it really competitive to study public health at baylor? Open to any advice.",

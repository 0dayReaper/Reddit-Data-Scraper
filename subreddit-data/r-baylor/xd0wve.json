There are so many factors that go into those rankings, and not all of them are actually about the quality of a school.",

Basically, if admissions thinks that an applicant isn't 'good enough' (low stats, maybe indicated they weren't super interested in Baylor, only applying as a safety school, had indicators they wouldn't graduate on time, etc.) to enroll normally, they offer deferred admission in the spring and usually some sort of carrot for the fall (studying abroad or stuff like that).\n\nThe spring-admitted students are in their own little unique metric bubble and impact rankings completely differently than traditional fall-admitted students, even though they're essentially all first-year students.\n\nThis is a little hyperbolic now because I don't know the exact formula, but those spring students? Something like half of them could drop-out, fail classes, etc. and it doesn't even make a dent in metrics compared to a handful of the fall-admitted students doing the same thing.",

That's why (at least when Frisky and I were there) Baylor owned that giant field next to the Ihop with no intention of doing anything with it. It made our campus *technically* more beautiful even if adding no value, aesthetic or otherwise, to our lives.",

It\u2019s basically like the cfb coaches top 25 poll, where presidents/deans rank each other\u2019s schools. It\u2019s a weighted sum model. Most of them have no idea about the others curriculum, how it compares to any others, nor have never set foot on nearly all of the campuses. One president was sending out his hot sauce to try to move up in ranks. Another dean (under disguise) at a highly ranked school admitted to not knowing anything about the schools he was ranking. It\u2019s a terrible ranking system born out of an unassuming article in the 80\u2019s US News published. Hate to see us drop tho, start sending out the sauce Livingston.",

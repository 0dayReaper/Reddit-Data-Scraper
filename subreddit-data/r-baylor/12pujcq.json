University Parks, Heritage House, and Brook Flats seem like the best places to live but I want to make sure I have at least 4 places I would want to live as I fill out my housing app.",

It\u2019s a great community and it makes it easy to meet other transfer students and other new people and make friends, I live there for almost 2 years when I was in undergrad and made some life long friends there!",

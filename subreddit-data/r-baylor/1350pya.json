If you have, please let me know if there's anything alarming or any concerns I should have before signing the lease. Your feedback would be much appreciated! Thanks in advance.",

Parking and noise was frequently an issue. \n\nIf you are ok with units that old, have you checked out university rentals? They're old too, but furnished and all utilities paid. \n\nThey own 2 bedroom places adjacent to campus, right next to Armstrong for $1100. They have cute communal courtyards where you could grill/lock up a bike if you want.",

If you haven't lived near students before, \n\n- expect more small fender bender type wrecks\n\n- they generally set off smoke alarms more, usually because they are learning how to cook. Aka started baking cookies then got distracted watching Shrek\n\n- more foot traffic than normal apartments. They may come and go from their apartment 5+ times day. \n\n- public spaces like pools and grills are used way more. \n\nI haven't known anyone with security issues. It's on a very high traffic road and lots of people are around, so you'll more likely see bad drunk decisions crime than scary gang crime. \n\nI answered your other two questions in my first comment.",

            "comment": "I personally wouldn't live there. I signed a sublease with them this semester and it went pretty...terribly. Some units are being furnished so it just depends on your luck of the draw. Overall, the apartment is ok itself. The biggest issue I had was management. We've had lots of issues with filing for maintenance and them showing up late and not fixing the problem. We've also had a bunch of random utility bills being billed to us. Most recently, Asset Living (management) took over around January. They didn't bill us utilities until April, where they backbilled everybody including electricity, water, sewage, and trash. I would also look at the lease very carefully. In the most current lease, it says that they are allowed in your apartment without warning or notice if needed. We recently had them come into our apartment without us knowing so they can size the floors. That just depends on if you're okay with it but I personally feel like an invasion of privacy. They're also increasing their rent prices too, and I just dont think the prices fit the quality of the apartment. Just a few things to keep in mind!",

I am trying to contact them via phone let's see what they say regarding it. I opted for a renovated apartment. In terms of billing at first, I was told about electricity but upon going through the lease I saw a bunch of other charges like  'Ancillary Billing', trash, and renters' insurance which I think I can transfer from my current provider.     \n\n\nI do have some questions if you don't mind me asking;   \n1) How are the neighbors/crowd?   \n2) Is the security okay around the apartment as I will be living with my wife?   \n3) Are Aircon units running fine?   \n4) Is parking an issue?",

The neighbors tend to keep to themselves and it's relatively quiet, save for some nights where people are walking back to their apartments after a night out. The walls and windows are pretty thin so you can hear them occasionally but it's not a problem. \n2. I've never experienced anything that's worrying while I was there since it's within the Baylor Bubble. Management told me that they don't have security cameras set up, and it's not gated but each unit has its own alarm system. I felt pretty safe overall though. \n3. I think it depends on the unit? I had the non-renovated unit but I lived on the second floor where it had two floors. The downstairs AirCon worked really well and it was able to spread throughout the bottom floor of the living room and kitchen. However, upstairs people had to buy their own window AC units to be installed through the window. \n4. Parking is not an issue at all. Some people had parking stickers but I never got one (I did register my car with the lease though). I never got towed either. You can get reserved parking spaces with some units but the rest is first come first serve. It can get a bit tricky to find a spot by your unit during peak semester time but it's not difficult to find another spot near it.",

Everything else is fine but the 'coming into our apartment without us knowing\" is something I wouldn't be comfortable with as well. Ms. D is in contact with us via email, but I think speaking to Ms. L in the management office might be favorable.   \n\n\nAny recommendations on if not The Centre then which apartment would be better? Thanks",

The outpost, LLSams (if they still have availabilities), and the Grove were decent places when i lived there. One of my friends lived at the domain and really liked it. \nI would avoid Eastgate at all cost, they have regular cockroach infestation and most of the apartments are old and not in good conditions.",

What are you majoring in? $100k of debt is too high for 90% of degrees but miiiiight be doable if you are in engineering or computer science. Still would not recommend unless you're at a truly elite school and can be confident you'll be competitive for the best of the best jobs after graduation.\n\nThe rule of thumb I often tell people is: don't take out more total debt than you will earn in annual salary with 2-3 years of graduation. Note that you also have to take into account potential grad school required for your chosen career path. Most importantly, *if you do not know these numbers pretty confidently, do not take out any hefty debt at all*.\n\n$50k of total debt is cheap and easy for an engineering major who will start at $60-70k immediately after undergrad with likely no grad school in their future. That same $50k will be difficult for a social work major who needs a Master's in order to do much and even then will struggle to make $50k until mid-career.\n\nNote that the numbers I cite are for loans/debt. If your parents can help with, say, $10k/year, that puts you at around $70k of loans which is doable if you're in a high-earning field and are confident you're really good at it.",

I have a 15k/ year scholarship from UOR but the total cost of attendance is somewhere around 70k I believe. No financial aid or scholarship offers from UCSD. For the University of Houston, my cost of attendance is around 18k a year, but my parents said the difference is manageable and they want me to go to Baylor",

As long as the 27k isn't causing financial stress it'll be worth it as I'm sure it maximizes your chances at med school. There could've been cheaper alternatives with lower chances of getting in and you could've weighed your option but truthfully the answer lies in how the 27k affects your finances.

The math of pre-med debt is a lot tougher to estimate because, well, the vast majority of pre-meds don't make it. But it sounds like it's your cheapest option anyway.\n\nI don't know what UOR is, and Baylor is straight up better than the other two, so yeah worth it without question. I generally think people stress way too much about small differences in academic prestige (which often doesn't correlate with undergrad learning experience anyway), but the difference between Houston and Baylor is pretty substantial, both academically and in terms of campus life/general \"college experience.\" Doubly so as a pre-med, which is Baylor's top academic sector.\n\nVery few schools out there offer better pre-med programs than Baylor, and Texas has the best concentration of med schools in the country so you're nearby to all of that. (California has a bunch, but they're even harder to get into as an out-of-stater than the Texas schools, which is a high bar. Not sure what your home state is, though.)",

It is COLD and snowy up there. Very brutal weather; one of the worst locations in the entire continental US in that regard. Don't even consider paying to go to school there unless you have visited *during the winter* and experienced it. It is a very common phenomenon for southerners to develop horrible seasonal depression at popular northern schools like Michigan and Cornell (which have *beautiful* summers) because of the climate.",

At 58k a year, that figure does not seem right to me\u2026it leads me to think that either Baylor barely accepted you and they don\u2019t expect you to enroll, or they don\u2019t think you need aid because of what your parents make? That is a lot a money, and while Baylor was some of the best four years of my life, I would strongly argue that it is not worth the price. It\u2019s a wonderful school but you can get an equal or better education for much less. Being a foreign resident though does limit those options, so private uni might be the best fit for you. Check out other scholarship opportunities from outside sources. For certain religious scholarships (if you are religious) for example, Baylor matched a scholarship I got through my state\u2019s Baptist association. That saved me 4K.\n\nAt 27k that is better for sure. It also depends on what field you go into, future salary, what living arrangements you are comfortable with post graduation, will you be helping a future spouse pay off their debt, etc.",

The one good thing about my student loans is that it kept my credit score way up. My credit is fuckin immaculate. But, it has prevented being able to travel and buy a house for a decade, so it's not really worth it imo.\n\n@OP, unless you really need to go to Baylor, I suggest you shop around. The same education is likely available elsewhere for cheaper. Some majors have an advantage at Baylor, but there is a larger than good chance you can get what you need at another school.",

Advice I wish I knew way back then.\n\n\u201811 Baylor grad and still paying student loans today (and foreseeable future). I wouldn\u2019t change my undergrad experience for anything but I will say to take time to consider alternative options, i.e., other schools. Or apply for every scholarship under the sun to help offset what you would take on in student loans. \n\nWhat\u2019s your major and can you go to other Texas schools (if you\u2019re a Texas resident) that offer a competitive degree in that field? I didn\u2019t fully know it then but I struggled with morale &amp; mental issues knowing how much I was making vs. how much was coming out of each of my paychecks to pay for life in general. It\u2019s still a sensitive subject to this day but I\u2019m in a much better spot financially than I was coming out of college.\n\nAnother thing I learned is that most real world jobs don\u2019t require specific degrees. I have known colleagues who went to lesser known schools and were in my industry at the same level, if not higher up the corporate ladder. And they had random degrees. It\u2019s the age old adage: it\u2019s not what you know but who you know. \n\nYour college experience will be whatever YOU make it. If you\u2019re really keen on going to Baylor, call the financial office and ask for scholarship opportunities and work with guidance counselor in finding more as well. Seriously you have no idea how big of a financial commitment you\u2019re making when you\u2019re young and it can have huge ramifications downstream. Be smart about this, OP. You got this.",

Here's the thing, your education is what you make of it. Paying for higher ranked schools only helps with initial interviews/networking but once you get past this stage its nothing more than the memories you made. It can be convenient going to higher ranked schools but that convenience isn't worth 58k a year.\n\nI'm sure you can lower this number but I still question if it'll be low enough to make it worth it. Explore your options but don't fall into the 'dream school' trap, your future self will thank you.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ll be enrolling as a journalism major this fall, and a family member has graciously offered to buy me a new laptop. But I\u2019m not a big tech guy, so I\u2019m not really sure what I should be looking for. Is RAM more important than storage? Do I need an SD card slot? Should I get a smaller laptop so I can carry it around more easily? Any advice or recommendations y\u2019all have will be much appreciated :)",

Apple silicon/M-series chips are ridiculously efficient. Apple has an education discount for college students. 8gb is fine for Macs, 16gb minimum for Windows. Storage is up to you.",

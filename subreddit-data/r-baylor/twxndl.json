Once on campus most athletic media swag is pretty easy to find and the athletic department buildings itself is where you can readily find posters for the more obscure sports. \n\nIf you're still having trouble finding what you were looking for, or easily need to get a couple dozen or more for distribution at a social event (official or not), the fan engagement department is a great resource.",

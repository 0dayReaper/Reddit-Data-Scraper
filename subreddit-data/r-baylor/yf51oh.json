After this time, the thread will be locked.\n\n 2. Predictions must clearly state the predicted winner and specific score. If no one predicts the correct winner, no one will win, and we will choose two winners next week.\n\n 3. All top-tier comments should be predictions. Discussion can take place as replies to other predictions.\n\n 4. Edited posts will be disqualified and removed. If you need to clarify your prediction, you can reply to your original comment. Otherwise, please delete and resubmit your prediction.\n\n 5. Flair up! To be eligible to win the pickem, you need flair! You can request flair in the official flair thread located in the sidebar. If you didn't graduate from Baylor, but you're a Baylor fan, just request \"Baylor Fan\" or \"Sic 'em Bears\"! If you're a fan of another team, you can request the mascot of your team, such as \"Longhorns\" or \"Sooners\".\n\nThe prediction that correctly chooses the winner, comes closest to guessing the actual score and was submitted earliest will win. The prize for winning is a free month of Reddit Premium (and spiffy flair)! Good luck! Pick 'em, Bears!",

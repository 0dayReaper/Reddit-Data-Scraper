    "postText": "I was just doing a little looking around are past championships headed into the Final Four tomorrow and realized that after Baylor's win in the Championship last year Sports Illustrated didn't do a Commemorative issue for the Championship. This seems like a huge oversight and I can't imagine that you all were very happy about it. Also, they didn't release a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack of the game either which is normally par for the course for the NCAA champion. What gives?\n\nWas the NCAA just so expecting Gonzaga to win that when they didn't they just didn't do the normal pomp and circumstance for the actual champion lol. Hope they do both of these things for this years champion (especially if its Kansas, Rock Chalk Jayhawk!)",

So there wasn't any expectation by the media that unbeatable* Gonzaga would lose. \n\nKind of a tail between the legs scurry by them when Gonzaga got demolished.\n\nThere's online articles but nothing in print other than the one Baylor published that I'm aware of.",

My major classes usually had probably 20-30 people in it? So that was definitely nice. I\u2019m not sure how much it\u2019s changed since though. \n\nI felt pretty prepared (and you will too if you continue working on stuff for fun in high school and through college), and there\u2019s plenty of demand for software devs.",

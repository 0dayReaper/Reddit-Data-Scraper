Barely said a word, only thing he said was \u201cVenmo\u201d when we told him we didn\u2019t have cash. Made a post on r/aggies today and many people have experienced the same thing. I also found some older Reddit posts with identical encounters under r/ufl and r/unt. Most people that commented on my post just dismissed it as just another scam, but this is extremely suspicious to me. The fact that multiple different universities are experiencing these identical encounters simultaneously suggests some level of organization. I just don\u2019t see individual hustlers replicating the exact same scam, especially on this scale.",

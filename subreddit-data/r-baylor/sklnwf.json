I'm willing to take about 30k in student loans but after aid my COA is still 39k a year and my parents can't cover anywhere near all of that. Are most people's parents actually paying for most of that considering the average debt is around 26k?",

Maybe you envision yourself being a freelance writer or a filmmaker, or teaching elementary school in an underprivileged area; if that's the case, having a lot of student loan debt could make it hard for you to pursue those career paths. You may end up having to work at a different job you dislike simply because it pays well.",

The large majority are on varying amounts of academic scholarships which can take huge chunks out of what you owe, even ranging up to full tuition, room, and board if you get multiple of the very top tier scholarships such as those that (at least used to be) offered through the Invitation to Excellence program.",

For example, taking 70-80k in loans is okay for an engineering or CS major, but if you were an education major you wouldn't want to take much more than 40-50k.\n\nEducation loans are an investment, like buying stocks or a house; if you're getting a positive ROI in the long run, it's worth it! And vice versa The trick is to do your research heavily on what amount is worth it for you *BEFORE* starting college. What gets people into trouble is going all-in on their dream school, taking all the loans necessary to go there, and then figuring out their career later.",

I have a similar concern about the COA which is even higher than yours. The only other scholarships remaining are honors and band, but even if he gets the maximum I still not see it as being affordable.\n\nI do have a good job and yes I could pull from retirement savings or get loans, but it is not worth it. I would rather put this in a savings account for my son so he could have a large down payment on a house after he enters the workforce.\n\nI think Baylor is a great school, but once you're in the workforce no hiring manager is going to care unless it is somewhere prestigious like Harvard or MIT. In my work I am responsible for hiring engineers and architects and I honestly don't even look at the university they graduated from. The college on your resume is mainly a checkbox for the recruiter in the HR department. \n\nThere could be instances were you get a job placement due to another Baylor alumn, but would that be worth $120k+ in student loans? \n\nWhatever you decide I wish you luck, maybe my son gets lucky and finds other scholarship opportunities and is able to join you all.",

Get as many credits from community college as you can before finishing your degree at Baylor.\n\n2. Attend another (preferably public) university.\n\nThere are plenty of students who leave Baylor with insurmountable debt. I know multiple people firsthand who had six figures after they graduated.

            "comment": "Here\u2019s the recipe:\n\n- take or retake the SAT until you get the highest score possible. The admissions people may say it is optional but they\u2019re certainly not blind to a really good score, especially compared to someone who does poorly on it or doesn\u2019t have a score at all.\n\n- study as hard as you can and do as well as you can on AP exams. A passing score of 3 on some of these exams will get you a semester to a whole year of college credits at Baylor.\n\n- this upcoming summer, take as many required general classes at your community college. You will enjoy small group discussions, find out what interests you and you will probably come out with a 4.0 GPA with little effort.\n\nHere\u2019s a link for you to see which classes will be accepted for transfer:\n\nhttps://www8.baylor.edu/ect/search-by-outside-institution\n\n- if you still have general classes that you haven\u2019t taken with the above, stay in community college until you\u2019re done with them. Unlike high school, you can start college at any semester (Fall, Summer, Spring)\n\n- once you\u2019re done with all the basic freshman/early sophomore classes, transfer to Baylor. With your excellent GPA, you should get a decent scholarship. Also look for other scholarships offered by Baylor\u2019s alumni/donors and of course, outside scholarships.\n\n- if you\u2019re a dependent to your parents and you\u2019re close to the limit between poor and middle class or middle class and rich, make sure none of you makes too much money. After a certain threshold, you wouldn\u2019t qualify for some grant money.\n\n- once you get to Baylor, study hard, don\u2019t waste any time, keep your eyes on your goal, graduate in 3 years max.\n\n- stay on your parents\u2019 health insurance \n\n- don\u2019t buy a car and therefore, don\u2019t bother with car insurance. A bicycle is all you need. \n\n- live off-campus but not too far from campus, share rent and utilities with a roommate\n\nMy other suggestion, if you\u2019re a Texas resident, would be to apply to all the universities in Texas that you wouldn\u2019t mind attending and to go to the one that will offer you the most amount of money (tuition plus room and board).\nAfter all, who knows, you might want to save money to go to Baylor for graduate school.",

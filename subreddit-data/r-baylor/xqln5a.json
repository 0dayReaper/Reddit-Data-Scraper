They haven't demonstrated the ability to force turnovers like last year's unit. That said, OSU also doesn't have the same caliber of RB they've had the last several years, which will be great for our defense.",

Taking away the run is crucial and allows the Baylor offense to to take control of games from a time of possession stand point. \n\nBaylor's defense has held four-consecutive opponents under 100 yards rushing to open the season.\n\nAlbany - 87\nBYU - 83\nTexas State - 82\nIowa State - 66\n\nDating back to at least 2009, that has never happened. In fact, it's never happened more than two consecutive games in that stretch. \n\nThe 2021 defense did it 6 times total. The 2019 defense did it three times.\n\nVery promising. Our secondary has young guys but they are more than a serviceable. Our front 7 is going to force sanders to get the ball out early and hopefully mitigate some of those big passing plays. Even then, this offense has shown elite \u201cbend don\u2019t break\u201d capability. They\u2019re very good all around.",

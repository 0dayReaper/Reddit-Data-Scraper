The Baylor counseling center causes about as much harm as good.  \n\n\nWhen I was a junior, one of my friends was seeing a councilor there. The councilor asked him if he was having thoughts of self-harm and he answered yes. The councilor called the campus police, who took him into custody, then drove him to an inpatient facility where he was kept for days. As a result, he was forced to drop out of Baylor.  \n\n\nI have heard others say that some of the councilors there are judgmental bible-beaters they didn't feel safe discussing their issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you need mental healthcare, it is an excellent idea to go off campus. If you don't know where to go, ask your insurance company for a list of covered psychiatrists in the area, make an appointment and ask in the appointment for a counseling referral.",

            "comment": "Just to say summer courses will be highly advanced and you can only take 8 hours per session but a total of 20 hours for the entire semester. (wintermester, summer1, summer2) I recommend taking no more than 2 classes per session for a total of 12 hours, excluding wintermester. This will allow you to study effectively and complete all the coursework. In summer courses you are looking about what is assigned every week will now be assigned everyday, so expect more like 50-100 pages of reading. This goes for most summer classes at Baylor.",

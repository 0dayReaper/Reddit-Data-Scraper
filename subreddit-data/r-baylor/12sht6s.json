He has you watch online pre recorded lectures and come in for one day to ask questions and thats it. He's also a little hard to understand if im honest.  In regards to Steven Rich I read on BuBooks (before it went down) that he has like a participation grade and deducts points for not answering questions and directs everything to his website which is wonky.",

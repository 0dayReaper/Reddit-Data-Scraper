            "comment": "Graduated from the theatre program about six years ago as a designer, and my partner also graduated from the program as a costume designer. I can talk more about the design side, but a bunch of this also applies for performers:\n\nPros:\n\n- Strong technical training for both actors and designers. I was the ATD at a resident theatre in Dallas for a while after I got out, and I was incredibly disappointed by the quality of the technicians coming out of the TCU, UNT, DBU, and sometimes even SMU programs.\n\n- The network. Baylor folks in the Dallas theatre scene are pretty tightly-knit, so you usually always know someone, or can ask around to find a Baylor alum, at any of the companies in DFW. Getting that warm handoff to a person you want to interface with can be invaluable. I\u2019ve been a lecturer at UNT and SMU in the last few years, and their programs aren\u2019t even *remotely* as tightly-knit as the Baylor program, and I credit that to Friday workshop. Getting everyone in the same space to watch some theatre and support friends is an invaluable camaraderie-building mechanism.\n\n- Lack of a masters program for design or performance. This is one that you don\u2019t find out is a blessing until you see how rough it is at schools that *do* have those: their undergrads are eternally going to stay second priority behind their MFA students for any and all mainstage design and performance roles. It\u2019s not uncommon at all to see UT and SMU grads who had exactly zero mainstage work (and the accompanying mentorship) in their undergraduate four years. That\u2019s a whole period of development that they didn\u2019t get at all, and comparatively a huge advantage for Baylor. Most designers at BU graduate with 2~4 mainstage designs (more for scenic and aound designers) and one or two assistantships, and performers almost always graduate with a handful of mainstage roles under their belts.\n\nNow, for the cons:\n\n- Cost. May or may not be an issue, but Baylor is undeniably expensive.\n\n- Lack of an affiliated professional theatre. Waco\u2019s growing like crazy, and may eventually have a professional theatre company for Baylor to partner with, but for now it lacks one. SMU is partnered with DTC, and that\u2019s absolutely invaluable for the few very promising SMU students who get to work with DTC, because they to get access to the Dallas theatre scene and start building their networks early. To make up for this on Baylor\u2019s end, Steven Pounders, John-Michael Marrs, and Jordan Rousseau all *extremely* active and well-connected in Dallas, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever told anyone in the Dallas scene that I went to Baylor without them asking if I knew some combination of those three. If you\u2019re heading down to Austin, Jojo, JMM, and Ryan Joyner are much more active down thataway.\n\n\nOverall, I had a great time with the department and don\u2019t regret it at all, and I think my partner feels the same way. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions!",

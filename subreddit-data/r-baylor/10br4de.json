So they may defer to somewhat gauge if you\u2019re truly interested, idk.",

I think I\u2019m reading the \u201ccan I still be considered\u201d paragraph to mean that you have to fill out the form below, and they will look at your application again as part of the non-early admission pool. \n\nI\u2019d recommend reaching out to your admissions counselor for clarity, and you potentially can ask them if there is anything you can do to improve your application? I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re allowed to tell you, but I would definitely recommend trying to get to know your counselor in general",

I also only did one essay and none of the other optional stuff. Keep in mind that all universities are looking for a certain type of student, and Baylor is one of those universities that wants it\u2019s students to REALLY be in the school spirit, and if you don\u2019t show that they rather admit someone who is, even if you might have better stats.",

I had a terrible GPA and SAT, 52 percentile of my class, and no idea what I was gonna do with my life. I just spent three semesters at a community College, got a 3.66, and applied. All they asked for was my transcript, got accepted 3 days later to the engineering program with a large scholarship. I didn't even pay for the application.",

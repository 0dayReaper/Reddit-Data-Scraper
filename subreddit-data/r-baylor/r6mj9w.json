    "postText": "I am a transfer student for the Spring semester and am in the process of registering for classes. Religious Scriptures is one of the classes I was advised to take but it was full when it came time for me to register. \n\nI believe I am currently 13th on the waitlist for that class. Does anyone know if this class would potentially get more seats opened? I've gotten off the waitlist for a couple other classes but I was like 1st position on those so I'm a little worried that I won't get this class for the semester. Does anyone have any insight?\n\nThanks!",

It was unqualifiedly the best part of my rocky Baylor experience, so I highly recommend it.\n\nI don't know if I got the maximum, but I do remember that I2E both took Baylor from an expense I could never afford to suddenly being (from my high school senior perspective) economically feasible. The people who did better seem to be the people who genuinely engaged with the text rather than trying to show off as the smartest person in the room. Don't take yourself so seriously that you fail to enjoy the experience, which will basically be a lecture and then a conversation about that. If you find you don't enjoy I2E, the HRC community isn't the best fit for you culturally, which isn't a reflection on you so much as the fact that the HRC is nerdy as hell and that's why I loved it.",

It's like a trial run of a college class and the kinds of conversations you'll have around the HRC. It is **not** a competition and seeing it as one will only hurt you. \n\nThe maximum award is given based on how much the people in charge of making that decision think you will make a good addition to the community. This scholarship is, in my mind, basically about how much fun you are to have in a discussion. Be aware of how much you're talking, make room to help others talk, and as long as you have something intelligent to add, you'll do great.",

It was a lot less stressful than I anticipated honestly.\n\npersonally my case study topic had nothing to do with my major and most of the people in my group didn\u2019t know much about the actual topic at hand except for me. the most important part imo was being able to use your OWN perspective and your perspective from your life and your major and being able to translate it into your case study.",

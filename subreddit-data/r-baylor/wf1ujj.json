            "comment": "This doesn\u2019t help with course/lab fees, but hopefully it can help you find cheaper textbooks. First, check with the university library. Oftentimes they\u2019ll have a copy or two of the textbook and you can check it out for the semester or create scans of the pages you\u2019ll need. You can also buy international versions of most textbooks (in English) for a small fraction of the cost at the bookstore. Abebooks.com is a website I used a lot, and I\u2019m sure there are more like it out there.",

And when you do buy them, order used from chegg, ask upperclassmen if they have any, or download them from a site like Z Library (use a vpn). Truly though, like half of my classes freshman year didn\u2019t even use the book that was \u201crequired.\u201d It\u2019s a racket the bookstore runs to squeeze some money out of the students. \n\nBeyond that, contact financial aid like the other poster said. Best of luck to you!",

But for what it\u2019s worth, HTeaO pays decently and will take you with minimal hours (like 6). The manager is a little odd but cool. I interviewed with them when COVID started but never took the spot because I was wanting 20+ hours. Good luck!",

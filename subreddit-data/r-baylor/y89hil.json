The Orionids meteor shower will actually peak early Friday morning (around 2:00 AM). 25-30 meteors per hour, so nothing incredible but still. There are also occasional fireballs from this shower.\n\nEdit: if you\u2019re interested in astronomy, the Central Texas Astronomy Society is located in Clifton around 45 minutes away. It\u2019s $35 to join, but they have monthly open houses. You can go look through their big telescope and learn about some of the research they do there. It was super cool and one of the best things I\u2019ve done in the Waco area.",

My train of thought is it being a class like how in high school or whatever art class was kinda just a period where you didn\u2019t have to use your brain",

Bowling, yoga, tennis, and racquetball are fun and relaxing. If you need interesting 3 hour classes, I\u2019d recommend stress management or human sexuality. For that matter, most public health electives are fairly easy and very interesting - go take a peek at the non-major classes and see what interests you. \n\nOther than that try looking at some of the intro art/drawing classes, those may give you chance to be creative in a low stakes environment. Hope that\u2019s helpful. Cheers.",

At the end of the day they\u2019re college students that want to have a good time, they\u2019re just slightly more religious than the average college student. The funny thing is that you might see something at a party on Saturday night and then hungover in church the next day.",

It comes pretty naturally at any college, BU included. \n\nPlus you will likely meet friends from other Texas cities and we have a bunch of colleges within driving distance from Waco. So if you wanna see what the big time stuff is like, UT isn\u2019t too far, and guaranteed someone in your circle will be from Austin and have buddies there. \n\nBaylor gave me the perfect balance of being stupid and young, but also gave me the space to grow and learn in an awesome environment. \n\n(I wasn\u2019t in a frat either)",

Also, I know very little people at my dorm, and mostly hang out with upperclassmen.\n\nETA: I would say that everyone\u2019s experience is different and Baylor isn\u2019t for everyone.

A lot of ethnic orgs are not race exclusive so if you were willing to join and understand another culture (and we also have a lot of great food to offer), they\u2019d welcome you with open arms - at least my org would. \n\nAlso, I get the background thing, and yes, a lot of people at Baylor are wealthy. However there\u2019s a lot of us who really need that scholarship (I do), otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be going to Baylor lol. I\u2019m gonna be in debt after the next four years.\n\nI think the most important thing that really helped with my time at Baylor was pursuing my hobbies through orgs like Baylor Videogame club, Tabletop, Marching Band, etc.\n\nBut ultimately, if you do not feel that Baylor is a home to you, then you can make a decision moving forward so that you can find a place that is home.",

I had a phenomenal time in college and every time I talk to grads from other schools about my time in college they always say that I had a dream college experience. College is what you make of it. \n\nYou\u2019re talking about sports? There\u2019s no guarantee of course, but Baylor is as good of a bet as any school that sports are going to be a big deal. \n\nNetworking and potential employment opportunities down the line? Again, this is a little bit of your own responsibility but I\u2019ve always felt that Baylor alumni are very open network and help each other, kind of like Aggies or Texas Exes, it\u2019s just a smaller network.\n\nMy advice would be to make sure that it is financially feasible for you to go to college (don\u2019t take too much debt to go) first and then go to the place where you feel like home.",

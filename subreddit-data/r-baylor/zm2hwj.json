    "postText": "Did anyone hear back for the I2E? It says you should know if you got it on December 12th and I was wondering if I just didn\u2019t get it or if they\u2019re waiting until I get accepted (I applied EA, still haven\u2019t heard back). My stats and ECs should be good enough to have qualified but I\u2019m just curious. Thanks.\n\nUpdate: I got in! Still don\u2019t know about I2E but I\u2019m assuming I didn\u2019t get invited.",

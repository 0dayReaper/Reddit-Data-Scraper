Well done by the coaches and we should all be thankful and supportive of what big bo does next!",

            "comment": "I started the season as a Gerry-truther and was pleasantly surprised at how much he had improved. He had a great season, but his passing ability was always his weakest ability. So many times we would have extended drives and/or scored with even slightly more accurate throws, but that was okay, we were winning.\n\nThen Shapen came in.\n\nThe offense was just electric with him at the helm. Defenses *really* had to respect the passing game, which made the excellent OLine and RB play even better. The one downside was that the playbook (at the time) was fairly heavy on options that defenses knew would be handoffs since Shapen is much smaller than Gerry and we were already on the back-up QB.\n\nWith a playbook designed around Shapen's strengths? I'm practically drooling at the thought. Just look what Grimes did with Zach Wilson.",

Mostly want to know if you think he would fit in a more traditional under the center offense, and if you think he is accurate. I know some people love arm strength and all that jazz, but honestly I just want my QB to be accurate and then anything on top of that is just gravy.",

                    "comment": "I would say that he had some flashes of absolutely elite passing ability where people would be blown away by a pass here and there, but also regularly underthrowing passes or being just inaccurate enough to put the ball outside of a WRs catch window. He can actually go through progressions during the play and make quick decisions, which is great, and means that INTs are rare (7 INTs out of 310+ career passing attempts).\n\nHe's a big dude, so he can also take off running and bruise his way to more yards if a play collapses.",

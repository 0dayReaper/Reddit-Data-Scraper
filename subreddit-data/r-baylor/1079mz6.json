If you study your ass off for the final, even if you get a perfect score you'll still end up with a C or C+ and can't retake the class for a better grade. But if you just give up and end up with a D or an F, you can retake it and (presumably now better versed) get a much higher grade.",

If you retake the class and get a higher game, you qualify for academic forgiveness. Use it and the old bad grade will be replaced by the new good grade; the bad grade will no longer count towards your GPA!!! It saved me :)",

There\u2019s prob room in ur degree plan unless ur a non-science major on pre med track) so def retake , and UPWARD TREND is huge. I didn\u2019t have the best GPA first year, but as the classes got harder my grades got better and med school admissions loved this! You need to take advantage of the resources baylor provides, SI is an enormous grade booster, office hours as well. It is a lot of effort to do well in pre med classes but if you want to, baylor is the right place to help you!! Def talk to your professors or dept chairs.",

I was fortunate that I came with lots of credits from high school so I didn't have to load myself much after, taking 12-14 hours every semester until graduation. Doing so allowed me to make a 3.9+ every semester after. I'm now a doctor in fellowship training, it can be overcome with good grades the rest of the time, extracurriculars, and an above avg MCAT, granted this was back in 2013.",

It\u2019s competitive enough.\n\nAlso this is a marathon in a medical career not a sprint so don\u2019t feel the need to rush it there.  \n\nYour ability to be successful long term and your sanity/happiness is most important. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nAlso know you\u2019re still capable and lots of people in my med school class took longer to get in who struggled academically in undergrad but after grad school got in.  They were even more successful than I was tbh and had more maturity to succeed in my opinion. Good luck. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf40",

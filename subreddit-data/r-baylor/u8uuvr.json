    "postText": "As an international student, all this different housing buildings with different \u201cvibes\u201d seem very odd to me. My mind struggles to get used to the idea that people are going to have a distinct lifestyle and behave differently just by living in another building. Therefore, I am having a hard time choosing a housing location. I will be a business major so maybe the business building is a good option. At the same time, I thought that the first year building might also be a good choice since it seems to me more \u201cneuter\u201d. Anyways, could you guys help me with your experience ?",

That being said, every dorm definitely does have groups of people that stick to their building. I made all of my friends outside of my dorm and they are also all in different forms. It just depends on what you want to do. I lived in a first year dorm and I think it\u2019s much better than specific community dorms. This way you branch out more and have friends outside of your own major.",

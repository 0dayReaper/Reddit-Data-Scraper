But in Flower Mound there should be a sister location. \n\nI think this address is it:\n3472 Long Prairie Rd, Flower Mound, TX 75022\n\nBasically, there were three siblings at one point and they each opened a location. One in Dallas area, one in Waco, and one in Austin. The Waco and Austin locations have the same items and menus, even the lettering on the window is the same. The Dallas location, assuming the address is it, seems to have to a different style but their bread rolls look the same so I\u2019m assuming this is it.",

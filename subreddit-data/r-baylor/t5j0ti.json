I\u2019ll fully admit that it\u2019s much less useful in industry, since most of our observed distributions lack closed-form functions that can be integrated or derived analytically, but you\u2019ll need to understand probability and the analytic methods necessary for the ideal distributions before you can understand *why* we do the things we do when our data set is far from ideal.\n\nThe large majority of academic probability (at the undergrad level) regards distributions that we integrate and derive to move from PDFs to CDFs, and then further up and down the order of moments.\n\nIt\u2019ll also be necessary if you get into regression theory, which is kind of the big gateway into statistical inference. There\u2019s not much integration required to understand that, but it\u2019s absolutely critical in a few places.",

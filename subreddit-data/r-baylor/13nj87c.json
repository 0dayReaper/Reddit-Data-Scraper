    "postText": "I am writing this post for prospective/ current freshmen as an opinion like this may have swayed my decision making 3 years ago.\n\nIn my freshman year, I considered applying to the Honors College as I was excited about the senior thesis. I decided not to as I didn't want to take great texts classes on my dime. Now, going into my senior year, I regret that as it wasn't that many classes and it has barred me from opportunities many times. From honors exclusive class sections, to classes only for honors/earle residents, to less of an opportunity to connect with professors in a mentorship context. There have even been prestigious summer programs only for honors students. \n\nI also regret not having the opportunity to pursue original research via the senior thesis as I currently am struggling to find a lab before my senior year and PI's are not impressed by my experience in statistical analysis/coding (only 'perk' I can offer as my personal interests are not something any labs here specialize in) as it is something they can teach a sophomore who can stay in their lab for years, plus if they wanted something high-level they'd reach out to an actual comp sci major. \n\nI believe I am as smart as my peers in this program but without the mentorship I lost out on I have misguided attempts instead of impressive accomplishments. \n\nI'm curious to know the experience of those in the Honors College, and if y'all believe it benefited you in the ways I assume it did. Also welcoming any advice for myself!",

            "comment": "As a student, I also regretted not doing honors. I also had trouble getting into a lab, and ended up graduating without any extra curricular lab experience. That was two years ago and I now have industry experience working in a GMP pharmaceutical lab. I can say with confidence that no one cares about my college experience any more. If you're good at what you do, thats all anyone will look at or ask about. And tbh, working in a pharmaceutical lab is so much easier than completing a biochemistry degree at baylor. OP - you're gonna be just fine as long as you put effort into whatever comes next. Looking back i still wish I would have done honors just for the personal challenge/achievement. So I would still recommend it to incoming freshmen. But don't panic if your resume isn't perfect. If you can graduate from Baylor, then you are smart enough and a hard enough worker to make it in your job field.",

We don't do any research i think, but its good gmp experience. I can troubleshoot many instruments. They don't pay a lot (40-50k starting with no experience), but its enough to get by with the relatively low cost of living out here. One or two years experience and you could transfer elsewhere and easily be in the 60-70k range.",

            "comment": "Did USchol and honors program, and to be perfectly honest, I don't think you're missing much. Writing a thesis is valuable but almost nobody in my class published their work or used it at all to get jobs or get into graduate school, and mine never came up in interviews. It's most useful for forming a mentorship with a faculty member, doing original work, and personal growth/skills. The registration and options benefits are good however. I loved the great texts courses. I met some of my best friends and wife in the HRC.\n\nBut that's all just the honors program. USchol, I'm conflicted about. It's a unique degree that lets you study lots of different things with wiggle room, has you \"master\" an independent reading list, has GPA and semester hours requirements, and some other perks. But it is absolutely *useless* if you are not planning on going into graduate school. I can't stress that enough, and there's the big issue: you need to be confident you want to continue education after Baylor and not go professional, because if you change your mind and switch majors late, you're fucked having to catch up on degree requirements you got to skip as a USchol. However, many USchols including myself knew we wanted to go to medical school (for example) and it was great. But the program was not good at communicating the stakes. \n\nHere's an example: A Junior in the USchol program decides he should change to an engineering major to get engineering internships and job offers. Suddenly they have to spend extra summers and semesters catching up on that degree's requirements, adding a huge time and financial burden with not much help in course correction.\n\nNotice how I just list my degree as a BA in chem and econ, and that's how I talk about my education to most programs, because they don't know what university scholars is unless you have time to explain it. \n\nTLDR, the honors program is great but not necessary for your post-college success, and Uschol has major issues with degree swapping or falling below the GPA requirement.",

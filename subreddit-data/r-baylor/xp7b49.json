    "postText": "I recently came across posters that showed the upcoming interest meetings for CL's positions. This semester I'm considered a second semester sophomore and I would like to continue to live on campus next year without paying the full amount. I have heard from my CL's that the position is like a part time job but it's not that bad. On the other hand, I have heard horror stories on the kind of problems CL's have to face. \n\nIm not a Christian that attends church so I believe I wouldn't make the criteria for being a CL. So do y'all have any insight on how the \"Christian active in the church\" would affect my chances of being a CL?\n\nBut Most of All:\n\nShould I apply for the position to reduce housing costs? Would it be better to get a part-time or work-study job?",

But yes we had plenty of responsibilities that probably safe to say were not always completely to the best of our ability.",

Yes, the free housing and food is great, but I most look forward to building true relationships with people I would not otherwise meet. I came into Baylor shy and awkward, and now I\u2019m in a community group through church and applying to be a CL. Both things I wouldn\u2019t fathom doing last year. I say apply to be a CL if you truly feel called to do so, even if you\u2019re not religious. I started applying last year &amp; just didn\u2019t think it was the right time, but this year I feel completely different. Otherwise I say to grab a part time job and rent off campus :)",

Cost of living is stupid now so saving that much more with R&amp;B is a big deal.\n\nI wish you well and think you are making a good call.",

            "comment": "Exactly 20 years ago baylor rebranded RAs to CLs and that was my sophomore year. Dorm directors were great and it didnt hurt their spouses were kinda dreamy too, at least in Penland (shout out to Jason Lewkowicks originally from Appalachian State).  Being a CL was worth it, at least for one year. Definitely felt the most connected that year of all my stay at baylor. Downside was probably the emergencies like moron freshman wrestling in the halls and giving concussions or the occasional drinking that we were supposed to write up.  Hands down though it was my favorite year at baylor. Only reason I stopped was to lessen my responsibilities into upperclasses and focus on top grades. Also moved into beargrounds with two room mates where my now wife also lived.\n\nCL isnt for everyone, and they may ask you to do stuff you dont want to, but free room and board and a stipend was great for me and made a lot of memories.\n\nSic em",

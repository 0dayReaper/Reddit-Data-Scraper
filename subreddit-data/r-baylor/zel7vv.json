    "postText": "Hey! I'm posting this here today because this is something I care about deeply and it won't happen without the support of people like you. Starting a petition isn't something I would normally do, but I was moved to do so because this rule will result in the murder of 60 innocent animals and it represents a problem in the way my university conducts research and student consent. I know I'm not alone and together we can make this change happen. Please sign and share! https://chng.it/9VwYxvmSLH",

            "comment": "Props for sticking to your morals, though contacting the NIH is a step too far. You've potentially dragged in the primary funding source for 20+ labs, many of which that aren't even in the BSB. You have most certainly raised more than a few eyebrows in the science department by now. Guidelines for raising lab animals are strict, but do not account for personal relationships formed between researchers and model. \n\nThe most I see happening is a revision of the lab manual to make it explicitly clear that lab rats will be killed. It's an unfortunate truth that the use of vivo animal models are necessary in research, and yes, behavioral studies are research.  \n\nPlease take a step back and realize the risk you're exposing yourself to.",

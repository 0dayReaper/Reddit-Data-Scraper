    "postText": "Schedule Tips: \n1. Keep a balanced schedule: Seriously, don\u2019t stack all your classes in one day (I did this and got fucked mentally).\n\n2. Spread out your classes (depends on whether you are a morning, afternoon or evening person). Have some breaks between because back to back classes are a pain especially if they are 75 minutes each \n\n3. Don\u2019t have classes in the night lol. I had Bio 2 at 8 PM lmao and it was ass. \n\nLife advice: \n1. Don\u2019t lock yourself in a room just so you can get that 4.0 seriously... First semester is the most fun. Get some good friends, network and interact with professors. \n\n2. Explore organizations and clubs and KEEP AN OPEN MIND. The more people you meet the less you feel stressed because they are all on the same boat as you. \n\n3. Have fun and chillax. Struggling during the first semester is common because college is harder than high school. Learn from your mistakes, get a feel of the workload and keep going. As a junior, I learned something new every semester to fix my work habits. \n\n4. Don\u2019t procrastinate. It hurts you way more in college than in high school. \n\nOther bears can add on to these tips. Feel free to ask any questions on here as well. Hope this helps.",

It makes their classes more fun, helps solidify letters of recommendation for post-grad/internships/jobs, and helps you learn your own learning style and which profs fit that style best\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso take classes that you want to take. I get that pre-med has a lot more basic requirements than my major is (so I'm putting out general advice here) so there's not as much room for electives, but if you want to take a creative writing class, go for it! If you want to take a film/digital media class, let no one stop you! Have some fun with your classes, too, and don't only take classes that are required.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, don't pursue a particular degree plan just because it's expected of you. If you want to be pre-med/pre-law/pre-dent/pre-whatever, all the better to you, but if you're doing it because of familial expectations, don't. College is hard enough without you studying something you have negative interest in",

Also want to add that in college, at least at Baylor, you will see your peers doing big things and some might even be high achievers, just know that they are on their own path and you will also have moments where things will work out. Your path is unique and different and that\u2019s normal. Don\u2019t feel intimidated by others\u2019 accomplishment and never feel unworthy. You are worthy!!!!!",

Put it on the due date and set at least a one week reminder. It's gonna take a little bit of time at the beginning of the semester, but you'll save yourself a ton of hassle and stress later.",

Additionally, this goes for every class, if you're struggling to submit something please email before the deadline, preferably with your file attached. You'll be way more likely to get credit.\n\nAlso, please read the rubrics and read the syllabus. The entire class I taught is out of 700 points, don't freak out because you missed a 10 point assignment and it currently says you have a C, that's only because it's week 2 and there's only been 4 assignments so far, just try not to miss too many and you'll probably be fine.",

I know it\u2019s hard when you expected that of yourself in high school, but the best thing to do is expect some Bs. It\u2019s not the end of the world, just do your best and don\u2019t stress too too much about the grade you get at the end. Besides, it\u2019s a game of diminishing returns. 3.4 is quite a bit better than 3.2, but 4.0 isn\u2019t loads better than 3.8.",

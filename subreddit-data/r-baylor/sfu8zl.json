I am currently in the process of deciding which university I am going to choose, so do y'all have any reasons why you love(d) Baylor or why I should choose Baylor over TCU? Any input would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "Biggest difference between the two is that Baylor is a lot more religious (and nerdy), despite the name of TCU. TCU also parties a lot harder; snow isn't just for winter up there. But it's not hard to find a party scene at Baylor if you are so inclined.\n\nBaylor is a little bigger, but not drastically so; I imagine both would feel pretty similarly sized on the ground. Both are similarly academically ranked, but Baylor has been climbing a lot lately thanks to increased investment in graduate research, whereas I think TCU has stayed pretty much the same. But again, it's close enough that it won't feel much different, especially to an undergrad. Unless you're talking about schools multiple tiers apart, your own personal performance matters way more than the name on the degree.\n\nReally, your decision should just come down to 3 things:\n\n1. Do you want a religious culture, or would you prefer a secular one?\n\n2. Do you want to live in a smaller \"college town\" where everything is dirt cheap and the whole town revolves around the school? Or would you rather live in the middle of a larger city that has more going on but is going to be more expensive and mostly indifferent to the school?\n\n3. *Most importantly*: which school offers you more money in scholarships?",

Each school has its own culture and vibe and you just have to see which one feels more of a fit for you.  Personally, I grew up in a Baylor family so I was always destined to attend Baylor; however, I always felt that Baylor has a great family atmosphere that was very inclusive.  I felt welcomed at all stages of my time in Waco.  When on the TCU campus, the vibe was just different.  Not necessarily good or bad.  Just much different.  Ultimately, both schools will offer you a great college education and likely a wonderful college experience.  \n\nFor illustration of the major culture difference - Baylor people will tell you both schools are great and offer tremendous opportunity for personal and academic growth.  Whereas TCU people will tell you that Waco is garbage and Baylor is full of rapists.  That's probably the best summation of the culture differences that I can offer.",

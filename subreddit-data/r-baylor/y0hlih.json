I think his coaching style &amp; message works better for college kids than pros. Plus, never having a reliable QB was not a plan to succeed in the NFL. At least he gave it a try, he is not the first college coach to go to the NFL &amp; not have success &amp; he won't be the last.",

He has a track record of quickly turning around struggling NCAA programs, so I have no doubt he'll get another major gig there if he doesn't land somewhere else in the NFL.",

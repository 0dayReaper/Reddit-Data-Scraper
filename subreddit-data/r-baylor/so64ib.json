    "postText": "If Baylor is able to pick it up and play with the same energy they had with the first 15 or so games at the start of the season, I think we may have a chance in advancing to the final 4. \n\nI say this primarily because unranked teams and teams ranked lower at least in the AP poll have been creating a quite a few upsets. Also the T10 in the AP poll most of the teams in there are really good and prolly better than Baylor if we don\u2019t get our stuff going. \n\nThat\u2019s just my two cents. March madness is gonna be pretty mad and exciting this year. What do you all think?",

Even when we were undefeated you could tell we just didn\u2019t have the players we had last year. No disrespect to our new guys, but there are very few starting guard lineups in NCAA history that I\u2019d take over Mitchell, Butler, and Teague.",

We have as inconsistent of guard play as a team could possibly have - akinjo, flagler, cryer can go 10/14 or 0/14 to start a game. not to mention injuries across the board. does not bode well for a deep run. which i hope im wrong - because sic'em.\n\nlast year if butler was down mitchell and teague stepped up. mitchell down, butler and teague put up 40. all of them down bad - mayer and vital had big games. we just dont have that for the most part this year.\n\nhuge regression for mayer. flagler isn't the guy. akinjo appears to be lost as a point guard. flo and jtt can't catch or hold onto a ball let alone not be in foul trouble.\n\nlot of talent but the pieces aren't fitting together just yet and talent isn't enough. just ask Texas about talent.",

What\u2019s crazy is that the team which had about 15-16 streak win games ends becoming close to bad at post season which is the key time to show that one is ready to play at the NCAA. \n\nIn Baylor\u2019s defense, all those games they\u2019ve lost were very close except for Kansas. That was just a blow out. Games like OKstate and tech, Baylor had a huge chance to win, but then blew it. Alabama didn\u2019t go well, but it was a great margin of loss relative to points like Kansas was. \n\nAs you said the talent is there, but it\u2019s slowly disappearing and the players seemed wearier by the end of each game. Hopefully, the bears can play a good game against k state. Sic K-state",

Last year\u2019s team was up there with the best college teams I\u2019ve ever seen (granted I\u2019m not a cbb junkie) so that skews our vision of what Baylor could/should be but that\u2019s just not realistic for anyone to expect to have THAT kind of team. \n\nI like to think we avoid an upset in the first two rounds, and everything after the Sweet 16 is just gravy for this team. Could this team win the national championship? We\u2019ve seen them play at that level a while ago so it\u2019s not crazy to say. I believe if we have the three main guards available (James, Adam, and LJ) we can make some noise for sure, they just need to be healthy and in the rotation.",

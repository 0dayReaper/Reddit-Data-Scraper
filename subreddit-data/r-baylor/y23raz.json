    "postText": "Hello, all. Although I am only a freshman, I am preparing to be ready for grad school now, and my first step is selecting a school. I would really love to go to baylor to get a master's in taxation. I think its a good fit for me. That said, can anyone tell me the things I will need to know to be ready -- necessary prerequisites (double majoring in finance and accounting right now at UTC), gpa required, gmat + gre scores required, other things I need to actually be accepted..... etc. Any information would be helpful, and I thank anyone who takes the time to help me out here!",

Try to do internships related to the masters because it demonstrates interest in the subject.\n\nSounds like you're a business student, so check out your professors' office hours and actually get to know them. Talk about the course, your future plans, etc. If you're a first semester freshmen, you probably haven't had multiple classes with the same professor yet, but if you do, they can be great resources for information and potential recommendation letters down the line.\n\nOther than that, tutoring isn't just for people about to fail, it's for everyone. It could be the difference between a B+ and an A, so don't be afraid to make use of that service.",

It could shift around what classes you take when and if summer courses would be necessary to have all the prerequisites completed in time.\n\nNot sure exactly if this would be included in the integrated masters program that they do for accountants, but like I said your advisor would be the best resource for this kind of info. \n\nGood luck!",

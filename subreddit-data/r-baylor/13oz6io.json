Baylor did an awful job of maintaining it. They would even hold rallies in the area that would scare the poor cubs half to death . Nationwide  attention was brought to it and that's a huge reason Baylor not only corrected itself but also really tried hard to scrub the internet of any documentation of how shit the facilities were. Not to mention stuff like having them on the sidelines of football games and quite literally drinking Dr pepper\n\nNow I'm super impressed by their facilities and it's really cool that they're class C zoo.",

Bears are pretty lazy animals. If they\u2019re fed, they\u2019re pretty content to just lay around. Ever make it to Cameron Park Zoo? They nap pretty much all day since they don\u2019t have to scavenge/hunt. It\u2019s about as good of a life as a bear can have.",

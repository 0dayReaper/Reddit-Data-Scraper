This was more than just because of the cost but the cost just did not make sense in my opinion/situation. I came in and they offered me a 3,000 dollar scholarship because I was a transfer but that was all I was given. The other 22K was left up to me to pay for. It does not help that the way Baylor is set up you\u2019re more than likely going to have to spend an extra semester because of all the other classes that are required for the degree. I am not even talking just chapel either. There are a lot of classes that I did not understand why I was required to take as a Pre-Business Major. However, I knew I was on pace to be well over 100K in debt had I stayed\u2026. Which is not worth it at all.\ud83e\udd71\ud83e\udd71\ud83e\udd71",

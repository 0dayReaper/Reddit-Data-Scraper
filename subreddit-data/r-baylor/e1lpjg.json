I have a shirt that says \"The sunset may be burnt orange, but heaven is green &amp; gold) &amp; there is a picture of the students toppling the goal post on it too. That is one of the few fond Baylor Football memories from my undergraduate years, since I was also witness to the UNLV debacle &amp; many blowouts at the hands of top 10 ranked teams.  \n\n\nI enjoy seeing Lovett run \"angry\". He was on a mission all game &amp; that run late in the game was a culmination of his effort all game. It was glorious.",

We have the best OL we've had in a long-ass time, so that should really help him look good, but Heisman good...?\n\nWould love to be proven wrong, of course. Zach Wilson was excellent under Grimes, and even he barely ended up in the top 10 finalists.",

Best O-Line since at least 2015, he\u2019s the most talented QB since Seth Russell (pain), and has plenty of talent at the TE, WR, and RB positions. Grimes has developed QBs very well in the past too.\n\nNot going to start a campaign but wouldn\u2019t be the most shocking thing to happen.",

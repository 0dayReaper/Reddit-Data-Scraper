    "postText": "Personally, I feel like there is a lack of maturity from some of the people I know since they continue to pester me about sending a zoom link to a church in Waco or inviting me over to some study session related to Bible or prayer. As much as I respect your religion and faith, please do return the favor. \n\nJust wanted to put this out. I am getting quite annoyed since all last year I was continuously disturbed with people pestering me and thought it had stopped, but it still continues. I even said I am not interested and yet these specific people are continuously putting efforts to invite me.",

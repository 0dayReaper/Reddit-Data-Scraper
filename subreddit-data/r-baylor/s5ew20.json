    "postText": "I recently gotten an email from University of Mary Hardin-Baylor. Baylor offered me the following: \nNo application fee \nNo essay \nNo letters of recommendation \nPriority scholarship consideration\nQuick admissions decision \n\nThose sound like good offers to me but I\u2019m not sure whether I should apply or not. My career pathway is engineering. Not sure if this is a good school for engineering. Also is Baylor expensive, I\u2019m planning to go in a dorm and I\u2019m not sure if it will be pricy in Baylor. I know the school is a private Christian school but I\u2019m atheist so does that matter??\n\nEdit: Yeah someone just told me that this Reddit doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the school I mentioned. My apologies, the schools have similar names. Ignore my post",

            "comment": "Mary-Hardin Baylor is a different school than Baylor University. It\u2019s been a while since I applied to Baylor, but as far as I can remember, there was no application fee, no essay, and no required letters of recommendation. That was several years ago, though, so things might be different.\n\nAs for Baylor itself, it is a very expensive school. Even with the scholarships I have, it costs an arm and a leg. It\u2019s a Christian school and there are a lot of Christians, but from what I\u2019ve heard, there are plenty of ways for non-Christians to get plugged into organizations and make friends and whatnot. Re: engineering, Baylor\u2019s not the best engineering school, but I have two really good friends who are engineering majors and seem to be enjoying it and learning from it. One scored a really good internship for the summer. Engineering may not be what Baylor is known for, but it\u2019s not terrible here",

Though I go to Baylor so I can only speak for BU, I know little about UMHB. \nYes Baylor is expensive, but they give good scholarships. Even so you still have to prepare to pay a lot unless you apply for outside scholarships as well or take a loan. They have a great financial aid office that\u2019s willing to help you out!\nEngineering at Baylor University is rigorous but an engineering degree from here is highly respected. Baylor has an amazing STEM field so any science, math, etc. degree is top tier.",

Not only is the engineering program known to be better than Baylor\u2019s, the network of engineers that you\u2019ll join at A&amp;M is going to be unmatched. A&amp;M\u2019s alumni network, particularly for engineers, would likely provide more employment opportunities for you.",

My brother just graduated from the engineering school and my dad has been involved as an alum in that department over the last decade and it\u2019s improved drastically. The previous dean was an A&amp;M alum and has helped move the program in the right direction, there is a new dean taking over this summer that would be worth you looking into if on the fence. You will have plenty of prospects either way.\n\nEdit: the dean I thought was there just left and replacement was recently announced",

Baylor is really awesome in most other ways, but the engineering department is a dud imo.\n\nEdit: I was in the program in 2017 for context.",

Engineering at Blinn (TEAB) was made as more of a spillover program for admitting students who would have gotten a full-time admission to the main campus, but by the time they came to their app, they just ran out of space. You get all the benefits a full-time TAMU student does; you live on campus, join orgs, can join honors, attend the same engineering courses, etc. You just take your core courses (math and science) at Blinn. But this really isn't even bad, as you save 2K per semester on average. TAMU does this thing called ETAM, where you need a certain GPA to get guaranteed admission to your first-choice major, and all engineering students, regardless if they are full-time TAMU or not, must go through this. So it is a level playing field for everybody, Blinn or not. Hope this helps (ik it's a lot).",

TAMU engineering is ranked #13 for undergrad and #10 for grad in the country, so it already puts it with the company of schools like UT Austin, Georgia Tech, and UCSD regarding the program and recognition. Not to mention that getting job offers and building a better network can be much easier at TAMU. Over the long term, it would be a better move to go to A&amp;M, but if Baylor is a lot cheaper (like 10K less or so) and you really can only afford to pay 28K a year over at A&amp;M, Baylor would be a good option. Not trying to diss Baylor, but A&amp;M has an excellent reputation with engineering for a reason.",

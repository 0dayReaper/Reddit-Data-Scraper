The AAI staff's names are not on the website either. Hum.\n\nFor those of you who don't know...the AAI organized many field studies to art museums in DFW area, NYC, LA and I believe Boston? Everything was covered so it was a great opportunity to students. They also held art lectures and offered scholarships to art history students. I'll be sad if it's gone-gone \ud83e\udd72\n\n(The new fibers professor's works look fantastic though)",

Another example of people being too rigid and not willing to compromise so you both end up missing out. Maybe something new will take its place someday but for now it looks like you\u2019re one of the proud keepers of the memory of the Before Times with the Allbritton folks.",

I loved going on the museum trips and attending the lectures they had.",

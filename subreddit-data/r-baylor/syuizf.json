They send out tens of thousands of invites, or more, to college students around the country based on a (fairly mediocre) GPA threshold to collect dues.\n\nPhi Kappa Phi (and *maybe* certain major-specific ones, but that depends entirely on the major/industry) is the only honor society that means anything. Any sort of grad school will care a lot about it and it would be a massive application boost, but if you're going straight into a job after graduation, no HR drone is going to know or care about it.",

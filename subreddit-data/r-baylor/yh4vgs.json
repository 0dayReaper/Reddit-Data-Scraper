I\u2019m not athletic in the slightest, so \ud83d\ude05 but I do find them interesting so I\u2019m just wondering how they\u2019d work out. \n\nThanks y\u2019all \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

Be ready to drive to the golf course though! \n\nI can also attest to Dardens Mass Comm class being a super interesting lecture, as well as an easy A if you show up and take it halfway seriously.",

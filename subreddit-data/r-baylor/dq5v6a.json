The Case (rest in peace) could seat 50k.\n\nWhile I agree it\u2019s hard to compete against a tv subscription and watching it from home, you are the first person I\u2019ve ever seen say we built too large. But I understand,  Nick Saban went on a rant a few years ago about students leaving at halftime to tailgate.  OU during their remodel even removed seats and lowered capacity to make more room for suites.",

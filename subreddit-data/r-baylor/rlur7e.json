    "postText": "Do you think Baylor may modify its policies about spring semester? I just really hope we don\u2019t go virtual or online. Most public schools like the UC system along with the IVIES have transition their winter and the 1st week of their classes next semester/quarter online. \n\nBaylor gotta do something because omicron is rapidly growing relative to cases and now all those that are vaccinated must take the booster cuz antibody levels drastically decrease without it.",

            "comment": "&gt;Baylor gotta do something because omicron is rapidly growing relative to cases\n\nWhy do they 'gotta do something'? The data out of South Africa is showing that Omicron has an *80% lower risk* of hospitalizations (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-22/omicron-has-80-lower-risk-of-hospitalization-new-study-shows?srnd=premium-europe). It has always been true that college aged people are at very low risks of adverse effects of covid.  Remote learning has broadly been a disaster both academically as well as for mental health (suicides are up dramatically among teens and 20s). Why isn't that science important? \n\nTo be clear I've taken the vaccine and gotten a booster and I think others should do so as well but, so far, the data is showing that omicron is a blessing and may even take us to treating covid-19 as endemic just like other covids (common cold) and flus.  Just because Ivies and UCs are over-reacting doesn't mean Baylor shouldn't follow the science.",

It probably is ramping up because of the holidays and it might calm down a little after New Year\u2019s. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll go online, though, they got way too much backlash in spring 2021 and they didn\u2019t go virtual in the fall when delta was raging.\n\nSide note, where did you find the spring semester policies? I didn\u2019t see anything in the presidential updates",

Bruh Baylor, I thought as a junior I\u2019d get an increased chance of getting the classes I want, but looks like most of planned classes are about to be full and seniors haven\u2019t even finished registering... are they gonna open up spots or what? Some classes only got like 25 max spots which is BS",

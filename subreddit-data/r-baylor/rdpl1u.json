    "postText": "Hey, so I recently found out that I got into Baylor and found out today that I was accepted into University Scholars. I just have a couple of questions.\n\n1. How competitive is University Scholars?\n2. As someone whose trying to go to Med school (or any grad school in general), but still wants to take a healthy bit of business classes \\[management oriented most likely\\], is University Scholars going to be worth it.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m business (accounting and finance) and got into university scholars and when I got in the people running the program literally told me do not do university scholars if you\u2019re planning in doing business as well - they might have had a different take if I was also doing pre-med. \n\nFull disclosure for this next part, I\u2019m in Business Fellows. \n\nI would say that almost everyone doing pre-med with business is a business fellow. Happy to talk more about fellows, but just to sum it up, it\u2019s kind of like a create your own courseload with an emphasis on business classes. Students graduate with a B.B.A in business fellows (essentially a general business degree) and have to take 60 hours outside of the business school (in your case that would be pre-med classes). Along with the B.B.A in business fellows, you graduate with degrees in every other major you\u2019d like. For example, I\u2019m majoring in accounting, finance, business fellows, and minoring in math. My pre-med friend is majoring in biochemistry, finance, business fellows, and minoring in math and is going to med school. \n\nTo my knowledge, in University Scholars you graduate with some type of bachelors in University Scholars with no other major (instead of other majors you have areas of emphasis). I could be wrong here, but that\u2019s what I remember about the program. The downside of this is that I don\u2019t know if other schools really know what university scholars is. \n\nAlong with this, I believe the honors program in general, university scholars included, is more grad school focused, although a thesis/practicum is required in business fellows as well. I think you should get more information about the ability to do business classes with USchol. If you\u2019re just looking to take a few classes, it should be no problem, but if you want to major/do an area of emphasis in business, I\u2019d make sure that\u2019s possible. \n\nAs far of the competitiveness, I\u2019d say USchol and Business Fellows are pretty similar with avg ACT around 33 (and whatever SAT correlates to that) and top high school performance.",

If you want to do business you should definitely do Fellows. USchol was a fine degree but it's better suited for the liberal arts. You can do premed for both",

            "comment": "First of all. Congratulations on your acceptance to Baylor and double Kudos to you for getting into the University Scholars program. It\u2019s very competitive to get into and while I am not an University Scholar, although former BIC Honors student, the program is very rigorous in both reading and writing. University scholars gives you the freedom to choose whatever concentration you want so of course you can add business as a concentration. It takes most of your Gen Eds away which is awesome and gives a lot of flexibility to the courses that you can take at Baylor. University Scholars program guarantees a medical acceptance is what I\u2019ve heard since you are getting the opportunity to write a thesis (looks great on a resume and research is important for med school) along with being a holistic student taking diverse classes and pursuing various activities. \n\nI would say that the only con to this program is it\u2019s a lot of work and classes are very rigorous so you will have double the work/ difficulty compared to your other peers outside of the honors college. And this program is essentially for people who are driven and want to explore the breadth and depth of what Baylor has to offer while also enhancing individual growth and pursuing what it really interests you. I would say it will be definitely worth it if you are willing to put in the effort and optimize what Uschol has to offer for you. \n\nAdditionally, the people you meet are just absolutely amazing along with the community honors college bestows upon its students. Welcome to Baylor. Looking forward to having you on campus next year.",

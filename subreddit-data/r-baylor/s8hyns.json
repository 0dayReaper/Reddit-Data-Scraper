    "postText": "I have spoken with multiple Baylor professors and they see me as a good candidate for their labs (even the ones that are really difficult to get in), but my grades specifically GPA from last semester since that had a slight drop compared to the others is making them hesitant about me joining their lab. I have been seeking for a position the past 2 years and it\u2019s really frustrating. Any suggestions or advice?",

PIs (especially Baylor PIs) cannot risk valuable time and resources onboarding an undergrad that doesn't end up contributing for a signifiant amount of time, or may end up inconveniencing ongoing projects. Forget joining a lab until you show that you can handle the rigors of upper-level classes--med prereqs only get harder after Genetics and Orgo.",

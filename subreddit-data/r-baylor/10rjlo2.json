If it\u2019s not, there are tons of other organizations to join. We also have rush in spring not the fall and Baylor doesn\u2019t have on-campus sorority and fraternity houses. Overall, it\u2019s a good place to get involved in Greek Life but it\u2019s not an overwhelming part of Baylor",

            "comment": "Unlike smaller schools, it's big enough to be significant for those in it. But unlike bigger schools or TCU or SMU, it's not totally overwhelming/pervasive for those outside of it, especially if you're not in the business school.\n\nI will say, however, that sorority life is significantly bigger at Baylor than frat life. I think close to half (if not an outright majority) of women I knew at Baylor were Greek, whereas I would probably go weeks at a time without speaking with a frat boy outside of intramural sports opponents. From what I can gather, trying to socialize as a non-Greek girl at Baylor seems much more difficult than as a non-Greek guy.\n\nNote that my experience is heavily colored by the fact that, as a BINF major, I spent half my time in biology/pre-med circles (which are like 80% female) and the other half in computer science circles (in which virtually nobody of either gender is Greek). Sororities seem much friendlier to difficult academic majors than fraternities do, no small part of which is probably the extensive hazing freshman year that frats do which will almost certainly sink your grades if you're in hard classes. I've heard they've cracked down on that sort of thing quite a bit since my time, but most of what I heard of wasn't exactly legal in the first place so who knows what the landscape is like now.\n\nBut once again, experiences may vary if you run in different circles, which is honestly kind of the beauty of college. You can shape your social life however you want it to be by choosing where you hang out and what activities you get involved in.",

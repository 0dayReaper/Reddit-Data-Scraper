    "postText": "My daughter got in through early action a couple weeks ago and she finalized her decision after attending the engineering and Teal tours recently. As a parent who is active duty military, I was able to pass my GI Bill along to her. I\u2019m understanding that the Yellow ribbon program became unlimited and covers what the GI won\u2019t. Can anyone clarify that and other than meal plans, is there anything I should be expecting to pay on a reoccurring basis? Thanks!",

So yes, it covers board, but you'll have to budget that with the money that goes directly to you/her.",

Veteran's Center might be a good resource to in getting that deferred. \n\nI'm using the GI bill right now at my undergrad, and it pretty much covers everything. Parking passes will be something you have to pay for, if she needs it. But that's really just odds and ends stuff. \n\nMy advice, not that you asked, is to make her get a job after freshman year. Housing is so cheap down there, she'd be able to live with roommates and use the rest of the BAH for food and car and gas. That job will give her a huge nest egg when she graduates. She could be 22 and own a house. Talk about setting her up for life. Good on you for saving that GI Bill. Lucky gal to go to Baylor for free (well, free to her).",

            "comment": "Hi! As a freshman at Baylor currently under the post 9/11 GI bill and yellow ribbon program, everything is fully covered by Baylor. They even give you a 500 dollar stipend for buying textbooks. They cover your dorm and your meal plan, the only reason why I have to pay a little out of pocket is because I\u2019m in a suite style room. I know that there are a few majors that are excluded from the GI bill at Baylor (computer science, elementary Ed, aviation), but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any restrictions on engineering!! If you have any questions at all, or if she needs another military kid friend here at baylor, let me know!!",

Though it looks like they switched up the majors and comp sci should be good now! Also, the VA will just send the living stipend to whatever bank account is linked to the gi bill, and if you live in a regular dorm the living stipend should cover pretty close to both. There may be a little extra, but it should be pretty similar",

    "postText": "Given what we saw the university of Oregon football program do yesterday, with the brazen financial backing of Nike and Phil knight to attract previously committed recruits from other schools, the rest of the college athletic world must break ties with Nike as an official apparel sponsor. \n\nNike is not a neutral player in the world of college athletics. They have a vested, and quite open interest in promoting one program over others and are willing to put the money they earn from other college programs into supporting that one in particular. \n\nUnder Armour has strong ties to the university of Maryland, but heretofore has not engaged in the shenanigan that Nike and Oregon have. \n\nAdidas has no historical ties to any US universities and  could benefit from a rebranding following their college basketball payments scandal. \n\nMuch like we saw with retailers moving their cloud infrastructure investments away from AWS as Amazon became more and more predatory in that world, colleges and universities will eventually recognize that Nike is not acting as a disinterested party and will seek to realign with another partner in this space. \n\nUltimately the decision to break ties will be on a university by university basis, but it is clear that continuing to support Nike as a college that isn\u2019t in Eugene is effectively helping to pay for the rope that will be used to hang you.",

He was committed to Baylor until recently but flipped to Oregon. Due to the loss of the \"next big Baylor quarterback\" many of more NIL-conservative fans are incensed, this post case in point.",

And they can certainly pay more than Baylor. Yet Austin choose Baylor over them. He's from a rich family already. So yeah, I don't think it was his primary consideration. \n\nLots of reports on the point to be Oregon's new coordinator Will Stein, the former UTSA offensive coordinator whom had a solid pre existing relationship with Austin Novosad. Not to mention Oregon has a much stronger history of placing QBs in the NFL, a more talented overall roster, and are showing much better QB development than we are. All this on top of just being a more prestigious program with more eyeballs on it in the first place. Its not crazy to think those things play a role in a decision.\n\nRegardless Baylor still needs to step up their NIL game if we want to stay competitive from a recruiting standpoint. Its the way the game is played now, adapt or die.",

Nike, UA, et al exist to make money &amp; asking/telling them to divest from college athletics will never happen. Also, Baylor is a Nike contracted school, as are several others in the Big 12. This was Phil Knight's doing in providing the money, not Nike. Phil Knight is a huge donor to Oregon, he gave Novosad the huge check (rumors are close to $5M), not Nike. I can see how that gets confusing as he co-founded Nike &amp; is chairman emeritus. If one of Baylor's huge donors had matched or exceeded Knight, would you still be as upset? NIL is currently the Wild West &amp; until it's reformed, it will continue to be that way. I'm pissed about it too, but AN had been showing his lack of integrity for a while. Once I get over the sting of it, I'll be glad he won't be a Bear.",

If all schools outside of Eugene send a message that this kind of fuckery has consequences, perhaps it will begin to chip away. While I am fully aware that Nike and Knight have separate checking accounts, he made his fortune and continues to amass wealth off of Nikes success. Punishing Nike, sends a message to knight that he needs to pick a lane. \n\nRegarding Novoturd, i will be surprised if he lasts for more than 2 years there.",

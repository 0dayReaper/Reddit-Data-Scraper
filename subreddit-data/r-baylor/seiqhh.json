I\u2019m currently in the reserves,   long run studying to be a PA, does anyone know if the offer PA shadowing? Or if the medical part of it is decent? \nThanks in advance!",

He is super chill former recon Marine who runs the vets program.\n\nhttps://www.baylor.edu/vets/index.php?id=961948\n\nThere should be plenty of shadow opportunities for PA or whatever else you need around waco. You'll probably be getting more emails than you want on different opportunities once you start school there.",

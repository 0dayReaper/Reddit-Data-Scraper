Also how exactly does it work, are there dorms, hosts families? If anyone has any experience with it, how was it for you? Do you regret it or was it a good decision?",

I would encourage you to search the subreddit at history for verto. \n\nIt seems to be a fairly new program and there were several discussions when it initially hit, there's a good chance some of those could provide you with some of the answers/ context you are looking for",

I am NOT a writer and I have always sucked at English classes\u2026 but that class was awesome. Interesting and relatively easy and the professor was so sweet. I graduated in 2014 though so she might not be there anymore\u2026 she was young and really nice. If you told me her name I would probably remember it. I also LOVED tai chi\u2026. It was so fun. But I think it\u2019s only 1hr\u2026 Hope this helps!",

Both are super laid back classes but you learn so much in them. Fun with great professors (at least when I took em). Best of luck and have a great year \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

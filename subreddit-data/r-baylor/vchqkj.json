There\u2019s also the Mix Cafe and some other stores in the Campus Corner near Earle that you can walk to. Other than that, I never really went off campus. I definitely didn\u2019t cross the highway because I was too scared to lol. And I never went to the Exon gas station after 6:00 because it got a bit sketchy. \n\nI managed to survive a year without a car but it was pretty hard. Would 100% recommend to get a car but if you can\u2019t, I still had tons of fun with my friends who did have cars. It\u2019s tolerable to live without a car, but I would say it\u2019s tolerable for a year max. After that, you will be wishing you have a car. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve heard Ubers are dangerous when alone, but if you\u2019re with people, I think it\u2019s fine. I took an Uber before, but only with a friend and we went to the Farmers Market and some coffee shops/lunch places. If you\u2019re alone, don\u2019t even consider taking an Uber. But if you and another friend without a car want to explore Waco a bit, that\u2019s not the worst option. I was always fine in an Uber if my friend was with me and we had fun exploring Waco.",

There's gonna be a bit of wait. You may need to ride one to the bus station in downtown first, and then change to other routes to get to other places. Get a ticket and you can use it all day long.",

You can cross the highway at the pedestrian bridge for access to downtown or follow the river for the long stretch of parks down that way. \n\nWaco is also a poor city, in part because most of its wealth subsidizes the university and university amenities.  The \"Baylor Bubble\" exists because a lot of students came from similarly sheltered middle-class communities. Waco is only scary in contrast. If you grew up taking the bus places, you'll be fine.",

To be frank- the safest part of Waco is Baylor campus, period. If you\u2019re heading more than, say, 2 blocks from campus streets, the standard of what your typical suburban mom would consider safe, but if you grew up outside of the suburbs anyways it\u2019s probably just a Tuesday afternoon.\n\nTo frame this: there was aggravated criminal activity &lt;5 blocks from campus during this past school year. I don\u2019t mean to scare you though, genuinely, because that was an isolated event that I cherry-picked to highlight the extent of the bad. That happened once, and I don\u2019t think I received another baylor-alert notice for the rest of the year. Waco *can* be sketchy, but not if you use your head.\n\nIf you\u2019re going somewhere in the daylight, walking isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world- it\u2019s just not great; You just need to be 100%, **conciously** aware of the fact that drivers *will* make mistakes, and *will already be distracted* by the fact that the construction is unpredictable. No one but Waco locals will know what\u2019s going on with construction at any given moment, so while people *normally* are pretty okay at stopping at stop signs and paying attention, it\u2019s entirely possible something will change overnight and make things hazardous- and that happens *often*.\n\nIdeally though, you would Uber into downtown and walk around from there. Central downtown is pretty okay, though the fringes tend to percolate up homeless folk and\u2026 other *interesting* characters.\n\nTL;DR if you make an effort to keep your head on your shoulders and stick to daylight hours, you\u2019ll probably be okay traipsing around the Baylor Bubble. Uber to a central area if you\u2019re really concerned though.",

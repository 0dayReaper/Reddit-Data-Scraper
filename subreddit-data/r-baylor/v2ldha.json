    "postText": "Hello there!\n\nI am an incoming male Masters' students who got his acceptance letter a bit late and I am currently looking for apartments. Ideally, I would like a one-bedroom apartment but I don't mind having roommates and living in a 3/4 BR apartment. But, as y'all can imagine, all the places I called are currently sold out.\n\nSo, if any of y'all have any advice or know people looking for roommates, please send them my way or let me know so I can reach out to them!\n\nMy only requirement is that it has to be within walking distance of campus. Don't really care about anything else.",

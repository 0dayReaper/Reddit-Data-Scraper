    "postText": "I missed the priority CSS profile Financial Aid thing and submitted it today. It says since I missed it I qualify for whatever is left. Is this going to screw me? I filed the FASFA a few months ago but Baylor took to long to say I was accepted and I did not even know what the css was until I got accepted a few days ago. Is most of the aid/scholarships from the CSS or is it merit based?? Also I qualified for zero aid from the FASFA so I'm not sure what I am gonna get from this. Anything would help",

They will more than likely tell you as they told me \u201c we just hope for the best for you \u201c no Financial Aid submitted my CSS profile months ago. Didn\u2019t even get a Merit base scholarship (transfers get screwed) I would say your best bet is parent plus loan and outside scholarships",

Now if you\u2019re the best thing since peanut butter and jelly and you become a STEM major and get a 4.0 GPA. You gonna be alright with that debt. Hell, even if you\u2019re a nurse major you will be okay for one semester or even a year to go into debt. Like I tell everyone unless you\u2019re Uber rich or as broke as a joke you will go into debt for most schools. Definitely weight out all your options and see what other schools give you. I would not hit the panic button yet but I would not give up yet!",

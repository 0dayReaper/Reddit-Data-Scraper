    "postText": "What level of foreign language courses are required to satisfy the foreign language requirements at Baylor for the mechanical engineering major? For the computer science major? I'm taking a Spanish course at my community college which counts as SPA 1302 at Baylor. Do you have to go beyond 1302 for mechanical engineering or computer science? Any clear responses would be greatly appreciated.",

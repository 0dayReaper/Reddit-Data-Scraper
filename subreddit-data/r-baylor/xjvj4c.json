    "postText": "To be fair, I did not do the homework as I aced the first quiz and assumed it was going to be easy from there on. Boy was I wrong. I did horrible on the quiz and am 4 topics behind in ALEKS. \n\nI also spend the least amount of time studying outside of the classroom, as biology and calc is taking the majority of my time. \n\nI know I have to do practice problems but the ALEKS problems are sometimes helpful, textbook problems in the end of the textbook are (Maybe) helpful haven\u2019t really peaked at it yet. SI sessions are definitely useful tho.",

There\u2019s still tons of time to salvage your grade though. Maybe ask the professor or TA how best to use your time. If you explain the situation, they will probably help guide you to success. Best of luck to you!",

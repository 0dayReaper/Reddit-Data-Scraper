    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI'm currently taking honors colloquium and am wondering if anyone can tell me how strict the grading requirements for the essays are. I've written one and am currently writing a second. I have yet to receive any feedback on the first and I'm worried I may be taking these essays too lightly lol! If anyone who's taken this course has any advice it would be much appreciated, thank you!",

Another one I put some work into got tremendous feedback that I then used to turn into part of my grad school app. I got in, so like most things in the honors program, you get out what you put in.",

    "postText": "TLDR: University Edge, 4x4 gated apartment, with 2 kitchens and laundry, 8 minute walk to Baylor, 3 leases to be taken over.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nLooking for people to take over mine and my roommates leases starting July 30 to July 27, 2024.\n\nBase rent is $644/month. Rent is negotiable. Furniture is an additional cost, but is optional.\n\nUtilities do not exceed $30. Internet and waste facilities are included.\n\nEach bedroom is furnished with a queen bed (frame + mattress) and a desk/chair.\n\nThe living area has a sectional and tv console. \nThere is also a rectangular dining table that can sit 6.\n\nAn interesting quirk about this apartment is that it is actually two 2x2s put together, which means there are two kitchens and two laundry rooms! \n\nAlso, It comes with an alarm system and the complex is gated. \n\nOne of the biggest pluses about this apartment complex is the management and maintenance crew who respond very fast.",

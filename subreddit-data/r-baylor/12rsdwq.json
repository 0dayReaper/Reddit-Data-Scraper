Thanks! \n\nSAT Score: 1200\n\nClass Rank out of 99: 23\n\n4.0 GPA: 3.769\n\n5.0 GPA: 4.659",

            "comment": "Your GPA looks fine. SAT is within the average that Baylor accepts, but I would recommend retaking it to be safe and shoot for a score in the 1300 range. I did early acceptance, which says if you get accepted to Baylor, you will go there before any other school. You can do other things, such as applying early and putting a lot of time into your essay. All in all you should be fine.",

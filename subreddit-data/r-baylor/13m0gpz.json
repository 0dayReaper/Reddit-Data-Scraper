I'm one hour away from the second summer discount, so if you guys have any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!",

You\u2019d be better off doing a class at a community college, just make sure the credits will transfer. Only reason you should do a Baylor online summer class is if you are running short on time for your degree plan and you can\u2019t do the class elsewhere.",

If you\u2019re worried about practicing and whatnot, I promise that A. The music is really easy to pick up, B. We practice it a ton during preseason week, and C. Your future section leader will get it to you early in the summer. I could rattle off the list if you\u2019d really like, but me saying saying \u2018Line Strong\u2019 or \u2018Let\u2019s Go Bears\u2019 really doesn\u2019t give you any useful info (if you really want a list I can go find it though lol)",

Mostly it\u2019s just percussion stuff and Line Strong (like 5 notes) if you want to listen there is a guy on youtube called \u201cZoren Too\u201d who posts a couple things in the stands, mostly show stuff.",

Otherwise, please delete and resubmit your prediction.\n5. **Flair up!** To be eligible to win the pickem, you need flair! You can request flair [in the official flair thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/pgnffl/user_flair_request_thread_fall_2021/?) located in the sidebar. If you didn't graduate from Baylor, but you're a Baylor fan, just request \"Baylor Fan\" or \"Sic 'em Bears\"! If you're a fan of another team, you can request the mascot of your team, such as \"Longhorns\" or \"Sooners\".\n\nThe prediction that correctly chooses the winner, comes closest to guessing the actual score and was submitted earliest will win. The prize for winning is a free month of Reddit Premium (and spiffy flair)! Good luck! Pick 'em, Bears!",

I just don't see how you can function at any kind of physical level for an extended period of time in weather like that.  Will there be more than a handful of people in the stands with a -15-degree wind chill?  I'm uncomfortably cold just sitting there when it's under 60 degrees.  I can't walk around in 10-degree weather (with zero or very little wind) for more than like 30 minutes before it starts to feel like something dangerous is starting to happen physically to my body -- I tried during the 2021 Texas Freeze.\n\nThis is a terrible game situation.  They should move the game to a different day.",

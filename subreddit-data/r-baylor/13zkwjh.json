    "postText": "Ok, so I\u2019m currently doing the ALEKS modules for Chem and I have a few questions. Is the chemistry ALEKS different from the math, in a sense that there is no actually exam to do? I ask this because when I\u2019m inside of the module, there isn\u2019t an option for an exam, so I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s just the mastery percentage that must be achieved. Also, for some reason when I go to goBaylor, it says that I have successfully completed the online ALEKS course, which I haven\u2019t yet. I was wondering if someone knew if that means that im done with it or not? Thanks.",

I think it\u2019ll make a great essay. \n\nLORs: My physics teacher - I was clearly her favorite student, My physical therapist that I also shadow with, and my assistant principal that selected me on an exclusive committee. \n\nSchools: \n\nReach: UT Austin RD\n\nTargets: Baylor ED, TCU EA, UHouston RD\n\nSafeties: UOregon RD, LSU ED\n\nWhat are my chances of getting into Baylor specifically? Also should I rethink going test-optional and submit my SAT score? I moved from Kansas this January, and my prior school didn\u2019t offer a lot of courses that my new school has. My class rank would\u2019ve been much higher at my old school. I\u2019ll probably explain this in my application also.",

            "comment": "Random guesses inside-test scores will make a lot of differences. How was PSAT? Score progressions? No NHS?\n\nBaylor(and other privates) I'd think you're chances are high. It's a private school, so if you'll pay the full price tuition and have decent grades they'll take you. Merit based scholarship awards- maybe...high test(sat/act) scores could help push you into receiving some aid. I guess you know you're SOL on FAFSA due to income. \n\nUT -if not accepted, may consider entering under a liberal arts degree and transfer a year in to physical therapy with excellent grades(unsure if this is accepted-so ask- but people change majors all the time). Beef up the essay and work on some additional LORs in medical field. Have a interview and work on great answers for any weak spots in your application.",

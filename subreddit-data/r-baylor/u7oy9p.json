That said, Baylor as the ASA (Asian Student Association) that's been around since the 90's to promote Asian culture and events on campus. I've seen there banners and signs around campus and I believe that their events are well-attended. We also have the Indian Subcontinent Student Association who even have their spring formal coming up!\n\nAs for people from another faith: there are plenty of threads that I've seen on this sub that encourage and reassure students of another faith about going to a Baptist school. There is absolutely zero pressure to convert or change. Other than the other threads I can't really prove that through first hand experience though, so I hope someone else chimes in with more information!",

I think they took the opportunity to get much less rigorous with baptist-specific traits and that jazz. Hitting R1 and sports success I think made them slow down a little with all that, so it's a much smoother ride for other faiths/denominations.\n\nThe videos they had us watch were like not very baptist at all, it felt very nondenominational which was interesting",

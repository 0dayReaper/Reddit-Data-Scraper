            "comment": "Honestly I tried to max out at like 2 big sciences classes per semester if I could when I was at Baylor, so it just depends what your needs are for your academic plan. Ochem II is just a bunch of BS memorizing reactions, microbio you need to just read the textbook probably, and HPhys would probably be your most intensive class. So yeah, talk to your advisor about this, I have no idea why your parents would want you to take all these at the same time if you don\u2019t need to. \n\nMy verdict: don\u2019t do it unless absolutely necessary",

Don't take them unless you feel really confident about it. Your GPA will regret it. \n\nIf you're planning on going to a 'professional' school after graduation, then spend time preparing for that instead. There's always something else to do apart from academics for people on (pre-) tracks",

If you\u2019re willing to put in lots of work, then yeah I\u2019m sure your fine. If not, I would explain to your folks on how difficult doing two of the three sciences is. \nI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re in ochem 1 right now \u2014 ochem II is leagues harder than ochem 1 based off of many opinions. Can you handle that along with two intense bios? \nI\u2019m also guessing you\u2019re on a prehealth track? You might need to take psych or sociology or some math class as well. Maybe you can replace microbio or Hphys with one of the other required courses on your track, hopefully, a bit easier course.",

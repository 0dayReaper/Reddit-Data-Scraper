He's a fantastic professor and person who insists on fun and a deep intellectual engagement. I never took him, unfortunately, but he still taught me enough Latin in our conversations to understand Monty Python jokes.",

We spent a lot of that summer debating various topics, including whether or not Latin is a necessary language, but in the end he did make me wish I had taken it with him.\n\nI think I remember people saying good things about Hanchey.",

He would never stop talking about him. \nI took Dr. Hunt for Great Texts, not Latin, and he\u2019s chill, easy-going, yet also smart and intellectual. But he always cracks dry jokes and it\u2019s so funny lol. And he is pretty relatable and understanding, especially during office hours. \nI don\u2019t know who Smith is but judging by the other comments, he\u2019s amazing too. \nReally, you can\u2019t go wrong here. I personally recommend Hunt, but I\u2019m biased since I\u2019ve only taken his class. Honestly you could just choose a random one and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have a great time.",

His assignments are pretty fast-paced and he sounds like he shoots up his coffee directly instead of drinking it before some lectures, but that\u2019s part of the charm. His jokes, analogies, etc. are all hilarious, too. \n\nI will be real tho, his class might be a bit tough if you\u2019re on the weaker end with Latin, but he\u2019s very understanding and wants all his students to do well.",

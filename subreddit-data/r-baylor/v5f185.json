Idk how this is a conversation. \n\n\nIn all seriousness, I've been really bummed by how few people seem to care about this issue at all. Al Jazeera gives it more coverage than our own outlets. The first news of her even being arrested casually mentioned it happened several weeks before the article was written.\n\nI hope they make the trade as soon as possible and this story doesn't become tragic",

With Brittney, if I remember the timeline correctly, Russia detained her before the big Ukraine invasion but didn't make it public until after the invasion started.",

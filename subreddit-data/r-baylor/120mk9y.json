I still have bond memories of it and I started college a decade ago. I didn\u2019t stay friends with my line camp group past the first semester, but it made it much easier to start college. During orientation and move in, it was very nice to have people to text and hang out with until I made other friends in my major/ in my sorority.",

If you are not an extrovert, I\u2019d highly recommend it as showing up day one knowing a few familiar faces that have a shared experience to you is helpful to not feel isolated.\n\nIf you choose not to go, Baylor still has other optional activities for incoming classes to attend upon arrival to the dorms, where you are doing the same summer camp activities led by faculty and CL\u2019s that encourage meeting new people. Such as sitting in a circle learning people\u2019s names and Baylor facts\u2026",

A lot of the people my first semester tended to stick to those they already knew or the people they met in line camp because they were familiar. They have welcome week where they encourage people to attend the events to meet new people but I saw that a lot of the people either didn\u2019t attend or seemed uninterested if they did go. I did the one day orientation and was able to meet some people but it didn\u2019t seem to last since we were only able to talk and hang out for about an hour and even then a lot of the people that went to orientation went with people from their hometown or something like that. Obviously cannot say if it\u2019s worth it since I didn\u2019t have the chance to go but I think it would\u2019ve been a nice experience and probably made my transition easier.",

I didn't have any friends from high school going to Baylor; for some reason I ended up in a Welcome Week group with people who lived in different dorms than I did so I basically never saw much of them; basically I felt like I started college completely without a social network and I am *not* one of those extroverted people who thrives in situations like that. I ate lunch all by myself my first day - it was like one of those bad \"new kid in high school\" tropes.\n\nBasically, just ask yourself how social/outgoing of a person you are. If you're not one, it might be better for you to go even though that may seem counterintuitive (it certainly did to me).",

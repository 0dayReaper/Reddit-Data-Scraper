Insert first technical, then second. Announcers were off their rockers. They described OSU coach's manner of leaving the court as classy or sportman like bc he congratulated Baylor coach and bench. \n\nI completely disagree. \n\nOSU still had a chance had he not got a double T. Baylor could have missed foul shots and with OSU only 4 points behind - a comeback was still possible. That loser coach failed his team. I agree officiating was too tight, but he didn't give his team chance to play it out.",

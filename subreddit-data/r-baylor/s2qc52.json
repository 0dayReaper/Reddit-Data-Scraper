    "postText": "They are gonna make it like this: \u201cAfter watching the omicron variant closely and seeing the surge of cases on campus, we have decided to push classes to a hybrid (prolly online). This decision was made with our sincere dedication towards our student and faculty + staff in mind (mostly profit) along with guidance from our health department. While this news may cause many students to feel pissed, it is the best decision possible (even tho we should have made it a long time ago)\u201d \n\nI swear if this actually happens, it\u2019s time we request Baylor to reduce tuition or other costs.",

They\u2019ve gotten a lot of backlash for making decisions 10 days before the start of the semester, and students are already making plans to go back and move back in. There\u2019s no way they make this decision with less than a week until the start of the semester",

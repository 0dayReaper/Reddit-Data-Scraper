    "postText": "I run a retreat center called Greene Family Camp in Bruceville, just south of Waco. I am looking for a few last-minute ropes facilitators for  Monday 2/27. Hours are 8am to Noon or 8 am to 6pm if you are available. Pay is $75/hr - you must be ropes course certified. You don't have to work both days, but it is preferred. If you have additional questions shoot me a PM and I will be happy to speak more about it.  \n\nEven if you can't make it on Monday, if you are certified hit me up - we are always looking for facilitators.",

    "postText": "Fuck yea we are. TBH, OKstate didn\u2019t even play OK and don\u2019t deserve the champ title. Love how we smothered them even till the very end. Had my doubts towards the 2nd half of the game, but Baylor defense came back and held their ground till the last inch. THATS WHAT\u2019S CALLED A T10 FOOTBALL TEAM IN THE NATION BABY. If we don\u2019t make it to the playoffs, fuck that we bounced back from last year\u2019s consecutive losses to winning a championship title this year. If we make it to the play offs, those teams better be ready. SIC\u2019EM FOREVER!!!!",

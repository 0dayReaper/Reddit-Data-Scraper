If you like languages (like myself) and is fairly proficient at picking up the basics of other languages really fast, I'd sign up for this course.\n\nIf not, consider taking that easy intro to art history something class? Or maybe you might've taken it bc I don't remember if it's one of those gen ed reqs haha. That class was relatively easy.\n\nFinal recommendation (if permissible because I don't know if it counts as elective hours tbh but it's a big introductory class so maybe it is) is that speech communication class (CSS 1302?). I'm taking that class and have 98% point something lol. A relatively easy class. :)",

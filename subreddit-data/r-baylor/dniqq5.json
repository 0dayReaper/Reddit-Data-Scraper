At that point, we will be undefeated and sitting around #6-8. OU should be around #8 or 9. Two top 10 teams, one of which is undefeated, squaring off will definitely draw attention. Plus, the only other contender for Gameday on November 16 is UGA vs. Auburn, neither of which is undefeated (but it's an SEC game, so go figure). We are still definitely in the one or two slot for Gameday currently. But let's just take care of business Thursday and in Fort Worth first. I really don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, especially after the cannibalization the conference suffered last Saturday. Sic 'em!",

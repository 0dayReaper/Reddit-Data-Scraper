After a rollercoaster of a game, Baylor just couldn't make the plays they needed to make, when they needed to make them. This was a very winnable game, the Bears just looked flat. \n\n* **Biggest Disappointment:** Penalties. Penalties. Penalties. Penalties. Penalties. Penalties. Oh, and also the penalties. Sweet shiny bald head of Dave Aranda, we shot ourselves in the foot a *lot* with penalties tonight.\n * *Honorable Mention:* RGIII was the color commentator in the booth tonight, calling the game for his alma mater. And he wore a *burnt orange* tie. Do better, man.\n\n* **Player of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* Easy pick for this one: Qualan Jones absolutely carried the offense tonight. With the possible exception of Ben Sims and Sqwirl Williams, he was one of the only players on the field who looked like he gave a damn every down. Stat line is 3 receptions for 17 yards, adding *16* rushes for 67 yards and two TDs. Baller.\n * *Defense:* Devin Neal gets my nod for the defense tonight. He was flying all over the field, and his stat line shows it: 6 total tackles, 4 solo, and he adds a sack and two TFLs.\n\n* **Play of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* Baylor tied the game up at 20 with a beautifully executed shot pass from Shapen to Ben Sims. It wasn't the flashiest play, but it went off without a hitch and it gave a surge of momentum to the Bears.\n * *Defense:* Al Walcott nearly intercepted Jaren Hall to end the game late in the 4th, even though the man's hand is wrapped in a hard cast that turns his fist into a melee weapon. That's pretty impressive. \n\n* **What We Learned:** I'm not exactly sure of all the root causes, but we had a lot of issue tonight. Penalties, poor play calling, a bunch of injuries, and an overall sense that Baylor just didn't know how to get on their game. And even still, it was a *very* winnable game. Baylor doesn't have anything to be ashamed of, but we definitely have some leaks to patch before we start conference play.\n\n* **Next Week:** The Bears return home to McLane, where they're going to take out some frustration on the Texas State Bobcats.\n\n* **Weekly Pickem Winner:** Uhhh.... So this is awkward. It's no one. No one picked BYU to win. So we will award two winners next week! \n\n---\n\n*Have anything to add? Comments? Concerns? Let me know in the comments below! Thanks, and sic' em Bears!*",

Either that or he's straight-up injured and they didn't want to put Drones in.\n\nDefense played great but weren't able to force any game-changing turnovers. Discipline was also a big issue on both sides of the ball.\n\nAnyways, lots to learn from this game but we might need to tamper our expectations for the season and count our blessings for taking the conference championship last year.\n\nSic em!\n\n^^^tfw ^^^Kansas ^^^has ^^^a ^^^better ^^^record ^^^than ^^^you",

Why run half these passing routes with check downs not even at the first down at the line to gain. His play calling is suspect and you can defend it if you\u2019d like but it\u2019s not a one game overreaction.\n\nAnd even if Grimes knew Shapen was hurt it\u2019s even more ridiculous that on the last 4th down he makes him throw a pass that he doesn\u2019t even give our players a chance to get or P.I.

Sure, it's a bit formulaic, but there's nothing wrong with that as long as our team does not hamstring themselves by committing as many penalties as we did.\n\nWe also ran the same Playbook last week and I didn't hear any complaining then either. Because it worked. The fact is that a lot of people are overreacting to his play calling after this game specifically that were not in the past. I take your point that you have been disappointed with this play calling for longer though.\n\nI think especially after the Briles era and the Rhule era this fan base has gotten accustomed to trick plays and misdirection, because both of those coaches tended to be more comfortable taking risks. Aranda is a lot more methodical, and he has chosen a lot more methodical assistants as well. Methodical is good as long as we don't ruin our own method.",

If it wasn't for the one play WR sweep with Baldwin (something actually clever) we would have lost against Ole Miss. \n\nNo one complained about the playbook last week because it actually included passing, this one did not. Also, even the announcers last week mentioned our playbook was quite conservative as to not show our cards for bigger games. At the time, I agreed but hindsight we were even more restrictive than the week prior for some unknown reason. You don't have to run a statue of liberty as a trick play, but you have to show some sort of understanding that you need a big play to keep the defense honest. While the design of the Sims TE pass at the end was clever, that was essentially one time we used the 50 running attempts to lure the defense into guessing. BYU was just stacking the box and shooting gaps. Our conservative play calling and risk adverse play calling is good when we're the more talented team but that's not going to fly in games against Texas, OkSt, and OU.",

I said our offensive play calling was sufficient that it did not cost us 12 wins.\n\nWe still have a defense that supports that type of play. I mentioned that in my PGR above, that we had many chances to win this game and that's due in large part to our defense. With the exception of 2 or 3 drives, our defense really stepped up against BYU. Our offense just didn't step up when we needed them to. And I will again point out that Shapen appeared to be injured, and Monaray Baldwin and Taye McWilliams did as well. Add the absolute mountain of flags thrown to that, and you have a recipe for disaster. All of which indicates that Grimes was at least hamstrung on the plays he was willing to call.",

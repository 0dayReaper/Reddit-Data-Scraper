We\u2019d have a good drive going and then once we got into their territory we\u2019d do some trick play that didn\u2019t work, fall behind in the sticks, and then the drive would fizzle.\n\nShapen has had his issues, but I think they\u2019re solvable (or at least improvable) in an offseason. I have less confidence in Grimes curbing his obsession with trick plays.",

His decision making is just awful; it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. He also had way too many completely blown throws today. IMO our qb position needs to be an open contest for next season.",

But I am not convinced that he's actually a better quarterback. There are multiple games that Baylor lost this season that I don't think they would have if Bohanon was still the QB.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see who starts for Baylor in 2023.",

He was averaging about a 70% completion rate prior to that injury, and hasn\u2019t had a single game past 64% since then. He\u2019s also throwing more interceptions, missing open receiver options, and not as accurate with the long ball.\n\nHe may not be clinically concussed, but I\u2019m pretty confident that he\u2019s not at 100% cognition.\n\nI\u2019m more concerned with where Drones is, development-wise, since the coaching staff didn\u2019t even give him a shot in a few of these games when Shapen was playing poorly. Drones basically only went in as a red zone RB, where he could take the direct snap and plow it in.",

I would not say he lost the TCU game, but he had a chance to win the game on his last play if he only threw it to the wide open receiver 8 yards in front of him. But he chose to go solo and force Baylor to punt.",

I think that our weaknesses at QB were covered up well by Abraham smith and our wr room. It also helps to have an elite defense. The wrs this year can't make plays unless they get perfectly thrown passes and shapen is late/underthrowing his passes when he isn't missing wide-open receivers. I think his decision-making is a step too slow and his deep ball isn't good enough to take the top off. Shapen was good last year despite his inexperience because he had a great supporting cast. \n\nThe reality is we aren't a blue blood and we aren't going to have elite athletes every year. It's going to take time to develop our young guys and get back to conference title contention. I think Baylor fans need to manage their expectations better. We have been extremely lucky to see so much winning and relevance in the past 10 years considering where the program came from the 10 years previous to that. \n\nMy prediction is Baylor is going to have a few down years before they have a roster capable of doing something like they did in 2019/2021 and something like tcu is doing now.",

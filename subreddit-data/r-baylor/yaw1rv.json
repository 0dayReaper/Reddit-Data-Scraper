At least 0.5 of that is just because it's Homecoming, and I'm a sucker for pageantry. But the Bears did play a good game! Would've liked it to be a bit more lopsided for Baylor, but we knew going into it that the Bears aren't as good as expected and the Jayhawks are better than expected. All in all, a fun, entertaining game (that turned out the right way)!\n\n* **Biggest Disappointment:** Turnovers. Taking care of the ball has been a game-defining issue for the Bears in the last several weeks. Today we turned the ball over three times and gave it over once more on downs, giving the Jayhawks unnecessary points and momentum. While there were many improvements this week over the games against WVU and OKST, I'd still love to see improvement in this area.\n\n* **Player of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* Richard. Absolute. Reese. The freshman's stat line speaks for itself: 31 rushes for 186 yds, 2 TDs, and even 26 yds receiving. That outdoes the entirety of the Jayhawk offense. Have a *DAY*, Richard! \n * *Defense:* On the defensive side, Devin Neal took it personally that he had a doppelganger on the Jayhawks and decided to show who deserves the name more. He was flying all over the field today, credited with 3 solo tackles and a crucial forced fumble.\n\n* **Play of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* Easily the most impressive offensive play on the day, Monaray Baldwin's 17 yard touchdown catch tossed by Blake Shapen. Couldn't have drawn up the play better and it saved Baylor from yet another slow start!\n * *Defense:* Early in the 1st quarter, on Kansas's 2nd drive of the day, Devin Lemear recovered a fumble forced by Devin Neal and returned it 18 yards, giving Baylor the ball at the Kansas 14 yard line. It was all but a chip-in for the touchdown with this play to set it up, and it established momentum for the majority of the first half!\n\n* **What We Learned:** The Bears still don't look like they've played a complete game, but there was noticeable improvement. More discipline, less stagnation, and more drive. Even when Kansas pushed for the comeback, it didn't seem Baylor was as listless as in previous weeks. I'll definitely take improvement. Let's hope we see more next week!\n\n* **Next Week:** The BUTT bowl goes to Lubbock!\n\n* **Weekly Pickem Winner:** This week\u2019s pickem winners are /u/MeatboxOne, with a prediction of [Baylor, 35-34](https://www.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/y86ioe/football_pickem_homecoming_edition_kansas/isyvn1n/) and /u/Trappist1, with a prediction of [Baylor, 42-14.](https://www.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/y86ioe/football_pickem_homecoming_edition_kansas/iszx4e4/) Congratulations on your wins, and enjoy your gold and spiffy flair!\n\n---\n\n*Have anything to add?

            "comment": "Three immediate observations:\n\nSome great plays by a number of young guys, including some true freshmen. I love that Aranda gave them a lot of playing time today. You're 3-3. Why not? Non-starters at S and CB had great breakups, even if Bean was able to throw with some consistency overall, especially in the second half.\n\nWhy did Baldwin leave the game? Hard to overstate how huge losing him would be.\n\nStill disappointed in the defense, Walcott in particular. Really think we need to move him back to CB and stop trying to reinvent Pitre (his best play of the day was a pass breakup). He's just not able to leverage any pressure on the QB at all.\n\nEdit: one more observation - Reese is our most exciting true freshman on offense since KD Cannon. Legitimate future all-american, maybe even Heisman candidate.",

We may have been a bit overrated going into this year in retrospect, but we are two plays away from being 6-1. Given how young the team is at most positions, I think this is an acceptable rebuilding year with lots of promise to be a conference championship contender again next season.",

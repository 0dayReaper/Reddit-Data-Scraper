If I remember correctly as a former biology major with a concentration in cell and molecular biology (and like you said), BIO 3342 must be completed before or at the same time as CHE 4341. I do not know your reason for needing this class but if my previous major choice is your current major choice, you should really talk to your advisor. BIO 3342 is a required course for said major and concentration.",

But if you really need this class, you should really contact your advisor or someone at CASA. Hopefully they'll be able to help you bypass the system or something. I wish you the best of luck!",

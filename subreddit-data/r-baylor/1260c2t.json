            "comment": "Wrong, professor Davidson is the best professor there is. From a student in the Small Cap practicum, professor Davidson is the best professor there is in all of the Business school. He genuinely cares to teach and doesn\u2019t find a need to make the course unnecessarily difficult on his students. He has a different approach to teaching than other finance teachers as he\u2019s a very practical application teacher. He was the CIO for Wells Fargo for 25 years and is along with being a great teacher, a great person to know and just an all around great person.",

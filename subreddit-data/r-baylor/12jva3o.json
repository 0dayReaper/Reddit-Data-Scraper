I had a great experience, and I still keep in touch with many of my closest friends from my college years. That said, the cost has become so high that crippling debt isn\u2019t worth it. If you have scholarships and/or family-funded tuition, go for it. Baylor is not so much greater than UTD to put yourself in six figures of debt before you even start your first adult job.\n\nMarketing as a major, though\u2026UTD isn\u2019t exactly known for its business school. STEM is where their reputation comes from. Ask yourself if you want to be paying off hundreds or even thousands of dollars a month right out of college. What happens when your generic Marketing degree gets you nothing but low-paying job offers (this happens every semester to students who don\u2019t plot their career choices ahead of time)?",

            "comment": "I went to Baylor but had tons of mates go to UTD.  Paying college loans suck, I had like $40k, so that $400-500 a month out of your paycheck off the top. \n\nBaylors business school is new and has lots of undergrad research opportunities in marketing - every business student is required to be test subjects and marketing majors run those studies. Dallas is a more lively city than Waco. \n\nI think baylor might be a more popular name than UTD, but you have to make the personal decision to determine whether or not that is worth paying loans. My degree would\u2019ve probably been better at UTD than it was at Baylor but I would\u2019ve never graduated if I was in dallas and could go out drinking all the time. So the extra money I took out in loans was worth it to me because I wouldn\u2019t have graduated had I not!",

Another concern could also be which university provides better networking and career placement opportunities.",

They are annoying while you are in them, but the career department is actually super helpful. They will help you build a resume, do mock interviews, etc. I\u2019m sure other universities use handshake but it is a godsend.",

They'll do it for STEM because it is tough to find enough people but marketing, especially right out of college? Not so much.  My honest recommendation is to not go into any debt and stay where you're at.  Do a one or two semester study abroad to get your US college experience.",

UTD doesn\u2019t have major sports and isn\u2019t even in Dallas, it\u2019s in Richardson and is a commuter school.",

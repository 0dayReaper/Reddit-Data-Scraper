It is also a bit of reach for desirable jobs through the alumni network outside of Texas. My best friend and I stuck with a company in Houston for a couple years before finding something we really wanted to do outside of Texas. Baylor\u2019s becoming more recognized, but nowhere on the same level as UT, A&amp;M, or Texas Tech.",

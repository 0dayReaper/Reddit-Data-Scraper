    "postText": "Okay long post.\n\nI(18F) am attending a private Christian university in Texas. I was sexually assaulted in February by my then-bf (21M.) I reported to the Title IX office after several months and decided to move forward with Adaptible Resolution, which essentially means \"not disciplinary.\" I wasn't trying to get the guy kicked out of school, just give him a reality check and keep him away from me. We ended up signing an agreement, limiting our contact to that within a classroom. Directly after that, we decided to get a No Contact directive, eliminating all communication.\n\nLast week, I was contacted by the Title IX office. They told me I was in three courses with my ex. One of these classes has only 4 students. I immediately contacted both my professor and the title IX office, asking if there was any way to fix this.\n\n**Here's the issue. The office can't do anything that restricts a student's access to academic resources and education.**\n\nOkay, fine. I'll sit in the class anyway, as long as he doesn't talk to me.\n\nThe title IX office responds and says\"Oh, actually the professor says that group discussion is essential, so we have to amend your no contact directive.\"\n\n**So now, not only do I have to sit in class with the person who raped me, but I also have to talk to him and have him talk to me.** I hesitantly agreed because the Title IX employee on the phone didn't really indicate that I had any other option.\n\nthen, I receive another phone call. They say, \"Well, since your initial Adaptable Resolution had this provision in it, we might as well just strike down the No Contact Order.\" Again, I felt like I had to agree.\n\nI considered just dropping the class, but it's not offered again until Fall 2024. The semester after I'm supposed to graduate. So essentially, my university is preventing me from graduating on time, and forcing me to choose between finishing my degree in 4 years, and preserving my mental healthy by not having contact with my abuser.\n\nSo here's my question. Is it worth contacting a lawyer? I really don't know what to do. I can't stand the thought of continuing the class, but I have to if I want to graduate. Plus I'm on scholarships, so I can't afford an extra semester.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\n**0 CommentsShare**",

I would get an attorney involved and make sure your attorney understands you're not trying to take this to the Supreme Court, you just want a resolution that ought to be provided under Title IX. A good attorney who understands what your goals are should be able to resolve this.",

I just need some context, is it Baylor or another, unnamed school and you just want advice from a like school? \n\nOn an entirely different note, when did you start college? If you're 18 and graduating before 2024, how are you doing that in 4 years?",

You don\u2019t even have to go through with actual litigation or anything. Just the mere presence of the attorney should make things more favorable for you.",

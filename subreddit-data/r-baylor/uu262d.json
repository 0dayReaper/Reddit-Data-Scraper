Some people have their socials in their matching profile, some you may just have to lookup, and/ or email them.\nAlso if you are a male it may be a little harder to find a roommate. Baylor has a lot more women than men, especially in the fine arts lcc. I know a few men who are looking for roommates in Heritage, they are definitely out there.\nHopefully this help! :)",

Also, you could always email them directly. If you know their Bear\\_ID, then just add @ baylor.edu.",

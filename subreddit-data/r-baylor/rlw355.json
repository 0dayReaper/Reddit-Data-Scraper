Can I still submit my essay or email it to the admissions office so my essays are included with my common app? Or is there a way to unsubmit it? HELP I'm struggling right now",

I would also try and call them and ask what the best course of action is if you want a quick response. I remember they took ages to respond to email when I applied. Most importantly, don't sweat it because it will all work out and the people in our admissions office have always been very friendly and understanding in my experience, especially over the phone!",

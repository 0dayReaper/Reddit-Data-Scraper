    "postText": "I currently pay full tuition to attend school since I had rather poor grades in highschool. As of now my only options are to transfer or to get scholarships to make cost of attending cheaper. I just finished my first semester with a 3.6 GPA, and am wondering how easy/difficult it is to get scholarships as a current student?",

They may not be able to give you money on the spot, but if you have decent grades at Baylor and financial need, they can often help. I know I was struggling financially at one point sophomore year and did that and suddenly the following semester until graduation, I had around 4k of extra scholarships I never applied for added to my account.\n\nJust remember they have limited funds and they won't be able to just promise them out without seeing who else needs help. If you can be polite and plead a convincing case though, they can help.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an upperclassman living in UParks. I was in a dorm last year so obviously this is an adjustment. I\u2019ve been paranoid since I moved in, feeling pretty unsafe. Waco scares me (even during the day) so the feeling of being \u201coff campus\u201d  is making me nervous. I was wide awake until 2:30am listening to every noise possible. Obviously this is insane, but is UParks actually safe or am I right to be on edge?\nThanks in advance :)",

Obviously a certain level of caution is always advisable (lock your doors, check the back of your car when you get in, be aware of your surroundings, etc.). But in general uparks is safe. The police come around often and it\u2019s a pretty long ways from most other things. It\u2019s also gated off which helps. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much!",

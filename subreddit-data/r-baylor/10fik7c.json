Worked throughout undergrad all four years in various roles, both inside and outside of Baylor. I\u2019m currently a supervisor in an on-campus job. Also interned in administration at a fairly large clinic system here in central Texas. \n\nNot a superb profile outside of my GPA at 3.97 but pretty well-rounded. Had a lot of experience to speak to in my interview which helped out. I\u2019d like to believe they cared more about that than just my GPA but it certainly helped out.\n\nHad a buddy with a lower GPA (3.4 ish) but similar experience and GRE get 50% scholarship. I don\u2019t know what it would take to get 100%, haven\u2019t heard from anybody who\u2019s gotten in say they got a full ride yet.",

They also told me I could make my own finance concentration since they don\u2019t offer an official finance concentration.",

The history department is criminally underrated at Baylor, and studying both at the same time would help you in both fields of study (also the added bonus of all the classes being in the same building). I can\u2019t speak to the business school, but I\u2019d at least recommend taking one or two history classes, and I\u2019d be more than willing to talk to you about the classes and professors for the history department",

I know a lot of the history professors work with their students to help put them on a good career path (my favorite prof found out I wanted to go into publishing and started finding opportunities for me). One of my best friends decided to major in journalism and minor in business, and a few history majors also did the same thing. The Career Center is also really helpful with this\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m always here to try and recruit more history majors lol",

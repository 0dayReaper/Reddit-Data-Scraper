            "comment": "To start off, it is difficult! It's a smaller program with a lot of 'weed-out' classes. Classes get a lot more intimate as you move through the curriculum. Tons and tons of valid experience to be gained in all the classes. Research is also relatively easy to launch yourself into if you are trying to break into academia, unlike, say, Biology or Chemistry where only the tip-top students at Baylor get into those labs.\n\nProjects are really cool, and you get some neat opportunities to work with industry professionals once you get into your higher-level classes like Software Engineering and Capstone. Expect plenty of group work, and plenty of hands-on coursework. \n\nEmployment opportunities are thrown at you from every angle, assuming you're an all right student (3.0+ GPA). Tons and tons of ECS-specific resources to find an internship and job before you graduate.\n\nMath isn't as big a part of the program as others. Calc 2 was the highest requirement for CS-General Track when I was there. I think this changes if you want to specialize in a specific track.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.",

Current freshman in CS but planning on transferring to MIS.\n\nTbh the math is what killed me, found my programming classes super interesting but ultimately found the Discrete Math and calculus too much to balance (never was a math expert)\n\nI don\u2019t struggle with math much but it takes extra work for me to really grasp it to perform well on tests. Ultimately decided that MIS would be better and have talked to a few industry professionals about it.\n\nI only went through CSI 1430, 1440, And Discrete Structures 2350 I think?\n\nDO NOT TAKE CINDY FRY FOR DISCRETE UNLESS YOURE SUPER CONFIDENT, I heard compared to profs she is super hard.\n\nOverall I\u2019d super recommend it, I just needed to go another path for my GPA and mental health LOL. Baylor\u2019s an awesome place and you really couldn\u2019t go wrong with any of the majors.\n\nI\u2019m more than happy to give recommendations on freshman teachers if you need them as well!",

            "comment": "Currently a sophomore CS Major and I think Baylor is a great place to learn CS. Yes it\u2019s incredibly difficult (but CS is gonna be difficult at any school), but basically all of of the CS professors are the best of the best(I\u2019ve only had 1 bad experience so far). I had literally 0 programming experience before coming to Baylor and was able to get an internship at a FAANG company this summer and 100% owe it all to the professors. From my experience they have all been very kind, responsive, and helpful. I personally think the main reason people drop or switch majors is because they didn\u2019t go to office hours as much as they should have and/or didn\u2019t want to study as hard as they needed too(not trying to be negative, some classes I would study 12hrs a day 7days a week for so, sometimes it\u2019s just a grind). \n\nIf you want to make life easier while your here: \n- Math: I would either take courses at MCC over the summer or use bubooks and just try to get a really good professor during fall/spring. Also, I personally HATED linear algebra and regret taking it over calc 3, but that also could just be me (plus I\u2019m terrible at math). \n\n- Science: rocks for jocks and then chemistry is supposed to be pretty easy. \n\n- CS: Your basically not going to have any options for specific professors teaching a class as it\u2019s usually the same professors teaching the same classes every semester. This may sound \u201cbad\u201d but IMO it\u2019s better because they have more experience teaching that subject and as a result teach it better than anyone else. \n\n- Intro 1 &amp; 2 are crucially important as they will make all future classes so much easier if you really focus on them. \n\n- Data structures and Algorithms are the most important classes when it comes to interviews specifically Data Structures (be a sponge in Dr. Hamerlys class as the man is a genius). \n\n- The career center is awesome! I think the last time I spoke with them they told me there was like a 99% job placement before graduation and 100% after. Plus the career fair kind of blew my mind and they usually have some really cool companies that visit throughout the semesters (just this semester I recall Tesla and SpaceX). \n\n- I wouldn\u2019t take data structures and intro to comp systems at the same time as they are both super difficult and basically impossible to manage. \n\n- For any other suggestions I would honestly just talk with upperclassman.\n\nLastly, and probably the most important part of the college experience is being able to network. Find successful people and try to mimic their success or at least learn what they did to become successful. \n\nCongrats by the way, I hope you found what you were looking for and wish you luck on your journey and future studies.",

            "comment": "I honestly found it to be kind of meh, and when I got out I felt behind many of my CS peers from other well-regarded Texas schools. When I was there (which, to be fair, was 4 years ago by now), the curriculum felt a bit behind the times (we had to do full classes on Java and using Java to make GUIs, but never learned anything about modern web apps until being thrown into one poorly-instructed Software Engineering II project) and the majority of the professors were... underwhelming (I think I had more classes that I would consider horribly taught than I did that I would consider well taught). It was definitely not on the level of Baylor's hard sciences or business school, both of which are extremely cutting edge and competitive programs with more amazing professors than you'd be able to take in two college lifetimes.\n\nBut I believe they've invested a lot in the College of Engineering and Computer Science since then in efforts to bring it up to speed, so things may be better now.\n\nIn any case, CS is the kind of thing where if you're a smart kid with a talent for the field you'll figure it out just fine. How good your professors and classes are isn't actually that important for your post-college outcomes. You can find good lectures and resources on YouTube and Google, and you'll always have to do that anyway no matter how good your classes themselves are. What matters is having good networking/recruiting opportunities for jobs, talented peers to work with and hang out with, and a social/living environment where you can be happy and enjoy life enough to actually be productive. Baylor has all of those in spades, so you can and will be extremely successful out of Baylor CS despite the drawbacks I mentioned.\n\nMy personal experience of feeling behind is also largely attributable to splitting my time (as a bioinformatics major) 50/50 between CS and hard sciences and not being able to focus fully on CS until my senior year, so don't let me scare you off from that alone. Those who don't do that are able to spend a lot more time and energy on outside-of-class CS learning and practical experience/side projects, which are where you really make your gains as a CS student. I got into an elite grad school and now good jobs just fine even despite all that.\n\nIf you do commit to Baylor for CS, I'd 100% recommend living in the Teal Residential College. Getting to be fully immersed in a social environment with dozens of students in the same classes/tracks as you is incredible for both networking and studying. You also get a quieter environment with lots of study spaces instead of the absolute chaos (and more cramped quarters) of a standard dorm building.",

That is honestly a lot of courses and I would suspect that had more to do with his readiness than anything else. That is kinda the trade off when you want to incorporate a lot of Bio/Chem courses in. \n\nFrom my experience, the curriculum is basically what you would find at any other school ranked within the top 100. A few larger departments seem to offer a bit more electives but the core part is identical. Only so many ways you can teach something is what it comes down to. I've listed a linked to the degree plans if you wanted to dive deeper into them yourself. \n\nhttps://www.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?id=962953",

His mission as an OChem professor is to get you ready for biochem and the MCAT.\n\nJust practice, practice, practice. Do problems over and over and over again all day.",

So if you know for a fact he's using ACS questions, study that book at all costs.\n\nTrying to get your hands on (a legal copy of) one was like trying to get a GPU. However, unlike GPUs, you can make PDFs of the ACS book and email them around so if you don't have one then talk to an upperclassman.",

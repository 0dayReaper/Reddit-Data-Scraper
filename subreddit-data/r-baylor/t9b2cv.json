    "postText": "Hi r/baylor\n\nThis is probably a question for u/darklordofairbear FYI\n\nFor those who do not know anything about wireless speakers, Sonos is a very common speaker setup within a lot of families. I currently have one in my bedroom that would be nice if I was able to take it to college with me next year; however since they are network speakers I was wondering if they were allowed on the network.",

            "comment": "First time I've heard of this kind of device trying to get on the network. You might want to look at using Airbear-DEVICE for this one, as it's intended for applications like this. It probably won't work with Airbear WPA2 since it doesn't support the needed 802.1x authentication.",

I can\u2019t tell you exactly how largely because I just sat and jacked with it until it finally worked. I do recall using the device network and having to re-register it 2-3 times due to trial and error.",

            "comment": "I tried EVERYTHING to connect my Sonos system. I tried registering the devices with Baylor, creating hotspots, connecting them to different networks, and yet nothing seemed to work.\n\nFWIW I was able to make a workaround but I know that ITS frowns upon it. I purchased a cheap (~$50) router from BestBuy, plugged it into the Ethernet port provided in my room, created a subnetwork and then was able to airplay and connect the speakers to my devices off of that. The network speeds were decent and it allowed me to connect to my speakers. The only downside was that I had to connect to the network every time I came home and wanted to play music, because my phone preferred the AirBear network over my little router.",

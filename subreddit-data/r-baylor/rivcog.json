            "comment": "Yes. Whatever field you're interested in, do some hw and look into the research profiles of the published faculty at Baylor. Find one or two professors you'd really like to work with, read some of their work, send a sincere email asking to meet and learn more about what they do. It helps to have had a class (and done well) with them but not necessary, I cold-emailed the first organic chem prof I really liked and ended up working in their lab for 2 years and doing my thesis on that research. \n\nIf you like chem, Drs. Wood, Pinney (my PI), Shaw, Farmer and Romo are especially prolific but two of those are pretty demanding. Be respectful, be humble, but also don't make yourself get super involved with a project if you decide you're gonna hate it. My experience was a huge influence on my grad school and now med school endeavors\n\nUpper level chem is hard depending on what. Easier ones: medicinal chemistry, inorganic chem. Harder ones: ochem 2, biochem 2 (the chemistry version obviously), physical chem, organic spectroscopy. There are others though I'm not as familiar!",

Now it certainly is easier with some professors than others, but I know plenty of undergrads working in all sorts of labs. I think the key is to show that you know what you're doing and actually want to help them, not use them to help you.\n\nAs for upper level chemistry courses, they definitely do get harder but I find that they build off of each other well. So as long as you stay focused and learn your fundamentals, you should be okay!\n\nI'm a junior studying chemistry and I do work in a lab so if you have any other questions, let me know!",

            "comment": "This really depends on what type of research you are interested in and the field you want to pursue. If you are interested in doing bench research that focuses on cancer for example, you would need more than simply asking a professor like credentials, possible research experience, resume/CV. \n\nOne of the labs that I inquired asked me to send in 3 faculty letter of recs, attend 3 interviews (two grad, one post doc) and then a trial semester to test dedication. Some labs have a GPA cap like 3.6-3.7+ or higher. Others may have specific upper level courses you would have to take in order to even be considered for the research position. There are some exceptions, but you would have to be really interested and eager about the PI\u2019s research. \n\nBe prepared to cast a wide net because professors take a very long time to reply to your email. If you want any tips/templates in writing an email to the PI of your interest, feel free to dm me. To get started, I would suggest to narrow down your interests and then find professors that align with what you want to do. Read their publications, reach out to other undergraduate research assistants or grad students in that lab and some labs have virtual tours so check that to get a feel of what it is like to be a research assistant. If you do get a meeting with the PI, make sure to ask a lot of questions and be excited about their research. \n\nThe PIs at Baylor are looking for people who are truly passionate about research and how this experience ties with your future pursuits/goals. Dedication and persistence as well as doing the assigned role well is important. If you are doing research for resume or for the sake of getting into med school and if that comes of in your email or while meeting with a PI, the chances of you getting a position is very slim.\n\nTo address your second question, upper level chem classes are difficult, but doable. It really depends on how much effort you put in and understanding of the material.",

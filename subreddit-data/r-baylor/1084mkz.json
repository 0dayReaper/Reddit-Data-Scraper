    "postText": "For transfers, how long did it take to get your decision? I applied in Dec. 14 and my admissions file was completed today, January 9th. (My transcript wasn't ready to send until January 3rd). I have a 3.87 college GPA and was admitted when I applied as a high school senior. I want to sign a lease for an apartment next year with friends but I don't want to do it until I have been admitted and the leases are going fast.",

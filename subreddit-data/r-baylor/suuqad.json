Technically yes you could fail if you quarantine, but most of my profs are (informally) barely taking attendence or allowing viewing a recording of class to count as attendence. We've used zoom for so long, better safe than sorry--make it official that we can zoom in on sick days without affecting attendence.",

I think the decision for masking wasn\u2019t as much for students as it was the faculty and staff who work hard to teach and support you. Many of us are older, immune compromised or otherwise high-risk, and masking helped plenty of faculty I know personally feel safe teaching in person. I agree it\u2019s probably time for them to go but hope you\u2019ll consider it was done for more than just a fun experiment in telling students what to do, because believe me, we hated enforcing it as much as you hated doing it.",

Your ability to spread microbes and germs to others - particularly those with compromised immune systems - makes it a matter of public health and regard for your fellow students to not take unnecessary risks with spreading a virus among a group of people. On your own, or outside of a classroom setting, I agree it\u2019s up to you. But we have an obligation as a university to maintain the health and safety of all our students.",

Germs are gonna be everywhere wheither we like it or not, and with the data released showing the covid vaxxed can spread it too, you dont know where you can get it from. Plus we still have yet to see data showing mandating masks has any impact on prevention of the disease being spread. Meaning either way, its inevitable that everyone will be exposed eventually.\n\nIm not against people being masked or vaxxed or saying they have to do class online for a time because they think they are vulerable. \n\nAnd if you mean being held legally liable for catching a disease in a private setting, I doubt a court would rule for such a shakey case to being with.\n\nBut I am against mandates. We all have our own bodily liberty and responsibility for our own health only. Even Docters and Nurses must wait for consent before giving treatement. I cannot help or always know another person's health. They must determine what to do about it themselves. Because wheither people as a whole are stupid or smart about their own health, at some point we'll have to live with it and accept the risk. Its the same way we accept the risk that every time we leave our rooms, we might get injured or die. We can try to minimize that risk as much as we can, but can never truly eliminate it. For the very few that are compromised, they can have exceptions to do things at home. But for the vast majority, we need to truly live with personal liberty, which entails pain suffering and risk. \n\nI know that this can seem a bit much, but mandating masks set a precedent for Authorities to determine health decisions. This can lead to lockdowns in our rooms like other universities did for weeks at a time, to 100% online classes (which severely degrade education quality for me and many other people), or for mandates for an endless series of vaccines to take with every variant as the goal posts get pushed for what is considered vaccinated (Single shot, doubel shot + 2 weeks, booster shot, quad vax, etc.) Though, I dont doubt your good intentions, I dont think this can lead to any good results from that.",

I\u2019ve read some pretty bad reviews of Baylor\u2019s photo provider Lauren Studios. Has anyone had any experiences with them good or bad? \n\nI plan to schedule a \u2018photos around campus\u2019 session with a student photographer I know so they won\u2019t be getting no photos if I don\u2019t use Lauren Studios.",

I do have friends who got some great shots.\n\nI ended up getting my girlfriend to take some pictures of me around campus in my cap and gown",

I think it took me like 10 minutes to take the photos and they turned out extremely okay. \n\nI would definitely recommend finding a photographer or a friend to take pictures around campus- those will likely be better and more meaningful than a generic yearbook photo. \n\nI would also recommend having a headshot taken during that session without any graduation robes/cap/stole on that you can use professionally for the first year or so after you graduate.",

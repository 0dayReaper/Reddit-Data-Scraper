My concern is that now many classes won't be taught by our best facu!ty, but by graduate students because those star faculty members will be required to research and publish. What made Baylor so unique when I was a student was how accessible faculty were to undergrads. Time will tell, but this is typically the implications of R1 status. #SicEm",

[an advocacy group found almost 25% D1 athletes experienced food insecurity in the last 30 days and 14% homelessness in the last year](https://www.wpr.org/survey-nearly-quarter-division-i-athletes-face-food-insecurity)\n\nAdopting and normalizing programs like this that treat these young people as adults and offer them a direct form of compensation is a good thing.",

Schools can set up a fund for academic awards up to $5980 per the Supreme Court in the Alston ruling. In this case, athletes are not being awarded for doing the bare minimum. They are being awarded for reaching certain academic milestones and metrics. We don\u2019t know yet what they are, but based on other systems at other schools, it seems like it will require something more than the minimum.\n\nAs for student subsidy of athletics, it is incorrect to say that \u201cnone of your tuition\u201d goes to athletics. If you pay an athletics fee, which almost every student does, that goes towards athletics. There may even be other hidden fees that goes towards that purpose. All but a select few athletic departments receives student subsidies for athletics, so Baylor is not unique in this circumstance. The exceptions are schools like Ohio State, Texas, Oklahoma, and others. This amount of subsidy tends to be higher and more prominent amongst public universities in lower tier conferences, but this is not the rule necessarily. Baylor\u2019s levels as a private school in the Big 12 are likely comparable or better than average when compared to other peers in the P5. However, this is an important topic as it gets to the growing question of the place of athletics in institutions intended for learning and research. NIL, realignment, growing tuition costs, reduced sports interests, are all driving a change and a gap that could someday break and we could find ourselves in a world without college athletics or some drastically different structure.",

    "postText": "I am soon to be a sophomore with a 2.81 cumulative GPA. My first year of college I did poorly due to health reasons and had to withdraw for medical reasons. I ended up having a 1.31. Since reenrolling in a different college, I have maintained a local GPA of 3.47 so far. I am planning on taking 12 credits this summer and if I do well, I should have a 3.0 by the end of it.\n\nHowever, I am interested in either the business or Biology / Biochemistry program. From my understanding once I have a 3.0 I will be eligible for business but I need a 3.5 to do the biology or biochemistry program. I have a professor who earned their master's and PhD from Baylor is willing to recommend me to the school.\n\nDoes anyone know if Baylor is willing to make exceptions?\n\nMeant to say I am wanting to transfer to Baylor",

You're not the first person who has dropped out of college due to unforeseen hardships who later on returned. That being said, I think the business school would be more willing to bend the rules than the biochemistry department. At least when I was there, biochem actively sought to get kids to drop it as a major, while only two of the folks I knew in the business school had above a 3.0.",

    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m an incoming freshman here at Baylor, I\u2019ve just moved in and I\u2019m looking for ways to meet people. I\u2019m a pre-med student but I really love drawing and creating art. I hope to keep this passion through my life, and I think joining a club would help me keep it up. Are there any art clubs or organizations on campus? I\u2019m looking through the organizations on Baylor Connect and I can\u2019t seem to find what I\u2019m looking for. If you could help me out that would be great! Thanks!",

You're always welcome to take the drawing/photo/ceramics/painting classes for non-majors there. No prerequisites needed. The Martin Museum inside the art building often has interesting shows. They display students works in the hallway, too, if you're curious about what projects they have in the classes. Let me know if you have any questions!",

I went to an early college high school so I\u2019m coming in with 71 credits. I\u2019m here for less time but the downside is I don\u2019t get to experience all those different fun classes. I will for sure check out the Martin Museum though, I love looking at other\u2019s art! Thanks for your help!",

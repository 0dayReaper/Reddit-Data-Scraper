    "postText": "Hey, guys! I\u2019m in a professional workplace class this semester, and the main project is to encourage more students to engage with the Career Center and Handshake! Part of that involves us knowing why there\u2019s less involvement than preferred, so I\u2019d be really appreciative if current students could fill out the Google form real quick. Alumni can participate if y\u2019all remember going to the Career Center or frustrations you had with it or the Handshake app, but ideally looking for current students! In return, I\u2019ll give you all the names of the best professors in my majors and minor and advice for how to get through those courses. Again, it\u2019d really mean a lot!\n\nEdit: guys, I\u2019m not kidding when I say this is for a class. Reddit is the best option I have for reaching out to a large student population. I know some alumni are on this sub and some have graduated recently enough to help on this project. But the person who just kept saying \u201cno\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not a student\u201d is hurting this project and my group\u2019s ability to do our work. Please, if you don\u2019t have something to contribute, then just exit the form or don\u2019t click on it. So the person who was trying to be funny, you just made it harder on my group and me.\n\nCurrent students are still welcome to participate! Alumni, I hope that funny guy was just a random high schooler, but please don\u2019t contribute unless you remember the Career Center or unless you graduated relatively recently. My grade kinda does depend on this, and I need a larger sample size than the friends I have\n\n[Google Form \u2013 Handshake / Career Center](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfeS0A7wfeYyLXeNsJdN8-4dUY2J3Ox1yjniNddEk9tDC5kAA/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

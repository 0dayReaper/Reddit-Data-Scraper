    "postText": "Who  is the best bio 1306 professor. I had Harvill for 1305 ,but his 1306 class is filled up .I currently have Dr. Mullins for 1306.As of right  now Harvill waitlist only has 3 people and Doyle has 5.Dr Gil has open spots ,but her low bubooks reviews are keeping me away from taking her. Dr.Dean was my original pick ,but my upperclassmen friends who took her told me to switch out to another professor if  I could. Should I stick with Dr.Mullins or hop on the waitlist.",

He\u2019s a great lecturer and the group discussions he holds are very helpful and let you think about the concepts in many different ways. If he\u2019s available this spring I highly recommend him but he rarely teaches undergrad sections\u2026",

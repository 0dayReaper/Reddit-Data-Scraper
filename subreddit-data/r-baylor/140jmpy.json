    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m an incoming Grad student coming to Baylor in the fall, and looking to rent an apartment for the duration of my program. I\u2019m not from the area so I\u2019m looking for some advice. Anyone have experience renting off campus? There are a ton of complexes I\u2019m finding online, but it\u2019s hard to trust their reviews. In your opinion, what\u2019s the best apartment complex near Baylor?",

It\u2019s also not affiliated with Baylor, so you don\u2019t have to deal with some of the rules and searches Baylor owned housing has, like no alcohol allowed ect. I would check out their website for sure. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the rent cost has gone way up since I\u2019d been there, but it\u2019s hard to beat it location wise, you can pretty much walk anywhere.",

Yeah they're definitely older, however the units are furnished and all utilities are paid and generally the sound proofing was good.\n\nBe warned, this may give you the expensive addiction of keeping your place at  60-65.",

I lived across the river in Brazos Park Apartments on MLK when I was in law school and it was perfect. Almost no undergrads. Law school is on the quarter system, so a different academic calendar and having a quiet complex meant everything.",

I'm currently working on one online through WGU.",

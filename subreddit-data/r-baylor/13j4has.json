North Village is really nice in general, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll regret choosing Heritage. \n\nHowever, it can be a little rough getting to certain places on campus because Heritage is tucked away in a corner. Chapel, for instance, is located quite literally on the opposite side of campus. So give yourself some extra time to hike to certain classes/buildings.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re bringing a car, you\u2019ll park in the North Village garage which is super convenient MOST of the time. When there\u2019s a football game, you\u2019ll likely have to move your car since they sell access to the garage for game days.",

Another commenter correctly mentioned that it is really tucked away so getting to chapel is quite the hike in the mornings. It\u2019s not nearly as bad as the Collins -&gt; BSB walk that some kids were doing everyday, but it\u2019s something to take into account. You might have more classes on the north side of campus, so it may be less of an issue for you.",

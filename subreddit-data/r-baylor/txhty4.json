Tho among other offers i have received, i can't decide on which university would be good for me. Can anyone share their experience in the campus, or maybe share their views on the cs program that Baylor offers.\nIt would be a great help, thanks.",

I the computer science buildings are nice and most of the cs teachers are really unique and fun to listen to.",

            "comment": "Here to say if you do CS, live in Teal. I do not think I could have survived the weed out if I didn\u2019t have other teal kids struggling next to me. CS is hard. The professors are tough but you look back and laugh. The community is really small but that means we\u2019re pretty close. Only thing is there is very few cs jobs hiring out of Baylor you have to go and get them they won\u2019t come and get you. It sounds as if money will be coming soon to try and give us some better stuff but they\u2019ve been saying that for a while. Cybersecurity is getting a revamp though so that might be worth looking into (still cs degree). Im just a freshman but I\u2019ve gotten to meet a lot of upperclassmen cs majors and they share the same basic sentiment. I\u2019ve enjoyed my time even though it is difficult. I bet you would too.",

            "comment": "The Baptist General Convention of Texas is seeking to review and consider changes to the \"special agreement\" that defines their relationship with the University. \n\nCurious that this is coming as the FBI announced their investigation of the Southern Baptist Convention. Some have speculated that Baylor leadership has wanted to make some gradual breaks with the SBC and BGCT. I know that granting the charter to the LGBT group on campus ruffled some feathers. I wonder if this is the start of that break. \n\nWill be interesting to see this develop.",

At this point, it would probably be an acceleration of the schedule, but it would make sense due to how the BGCT already broached that topic in 2020 by clarifying that they don\u2019t consider us to be an \u201caffiliated institution\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t think Baylor pulls the trigger on this now, unless the DOJ investigation into the SBC starts getting getting some nasty press, but I bet they start ramping up that timeline in the anticipation of some results from that investigation around late 2023 through 2024.",

Yeah, I definitely think the administration sees this being the first step towards becoming more like TCU and SMU. Which is a bit of a shame, because the Christian Mission is a big part of Baylor's identity. Even if we must break from the BGCT, I hope we don't abandon that mission completely.",

[For decades now, Baylor has been the training place of Baptist leadership both nationwide and globally](https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-war-for-thee-university/amp/), and the BGCT is the Baptist conference that maintains an exclusive governance relationship with Baylor. This quote, from the 1991 article linked above, is gonna sound awfully familiar to anyone familiar with the modern Baptist polity:\n\n&gt;For the past twelve years, two antagonistic, irreconcilable groups of Baptists\u2014popularly known as fundamentalists and moderates\u2014have been at war over theology, politics, and culture. The fundamentalists believe that the Bible contains no errors and want to return to the old-time religion of past generations, while the moderates believe each individual is his own priest and can interpret the Bible for himself. It\u2019s a lot more complicated than that, of course, as is everything about the Baptists, but one thing is clear. Fundamentalists are in power, and they want control of Baylor, the only Baptist treasure that has eluded them. Throughout the Southern Baptist domain, fundamentalists elect the important officials, control the seminaries, write the Sunday school books, and occupy the major pulpits. Baylor is all the moderates have left, and they are determined to keep it.\n\nAnd on Baylor\u2019s importance to the Baptist world:\n\n&gt;Baylor is to Baptists what Notre Dame is to Catholics. Groups of Baptists make regular trips to Baylor\u2019s 428-acre campus, built along the Brazos River, and proudly point to the Pat Neff Hall, Old Main, and Armstrong-Browning Library as sacred shrines. Moderates and fundamentalists can\u2019t agree about what to call each other\u2014they fight over who are the real conservatives\u2014but they all refer to Baylor by the same nicknames: Thee University, Jerusalem on the Brazos, the Baylor Bubble, the Crown Jewel.\n\nThis was immediately in the aftermath of Baylor split with the more fundamentalist SBC, in favor the more moderate BGCT, after the SBC made repeated moves toward increasing their power over Baylor\u2019s on-campus operations. In the decades since, the BGCT has followed a similar path toward fundamentalism and a pattern of encroaching attempts at influencing Baylor\u2019s operations. For all of his many, many faults, Ken Starr did successfully pull Baylor farther from the BGCT\u2019s clutches, and Dr. Linda has continued that trend while walking a narrow line between offending the increasingly fundamentalist Baptist world and the mainstream, largely secular, academic society that Baylor needs to earn respect from.\n\nBaylor gains functionally nothing by a formal relationship with the BGCT, while the BGCT\u2019s gain is immense. As a former academic administrator (at another major institution here in Texas, not at Baylor), I would be very surprised if Baylor\u2019s administration didn\u2019t have their eye on an arrangement more like what Duke and SMU have with the Methodist church, where they\u2019re still related, but the church has no influence or explicit hand in the schools\u2019 governance structures.",

Baylor was historically *very* focused on undergraduate pedagogical excellence, and passed on the opportunity to build a major research wing in the post-WWII university research funding boom. Nowadays, universities cover a substantial portion of their costs with the standard administrative cut from grants earned by faculty, and schools without major research wings are left to attempt to make up the difference on their increasing operational costs by increasing tuition and soliciting donations. As a former higher ed administrator myself, that donor pool isn\u2019t bottomless, and the relationship between tuition cost and enrollment is an inverted parabola. There\u2019s a maximum tuition ar any point in time that can be charged before you start losing students and your net revenue decreases.\n\nBaylor *needs* to be viable in the modern research space. Having worked very closely with TCU\u2019s IR people during my time with UNT, I can promise you that their lack of a research wing is *tremendously* concerning to the institutional leadership. That\u2019s why they just bought UNTHSC out of the UNT-TCU joint medical school, they want to fire up a clinical research wing and all of the boku research grant bucks that come with clinical research activity. If TCU can\u2019t get that research activity wing up to a point that it\u2019s helping to mitigate their operational costs within the decade, it\u2019s hardly excessive to say that the university\u2019s going to be at least approaching insolvent by 2040. Baylor, on the other hand, has made considerably more headway than TCU in developing a research wing that generates adequate revenues and helps build the institutional reputation, which itself attracts more students.\n\nWe\u2019re at the point now where Baylor\u2019s close ties to a socially regressive organization are making Baylor\u2019s forward progress as a research institution increasingly difficult, and they\u2019re a turnoff to the vast majority of researchers of the caliber that Baylor both wants and needs to attract to continue this progress.\n\nI\u2019s be surprised if Baylor\u2019s administration weren\u2019t eying a relationship like what the Methodist Church has with Duke and SMU: an association that doesn\u2019t include any hand in university operations or governance beyond the church\u2019s approval in the school\u2019s seminary.\n\nEdit: Got the long end of the autocorrect stick.

I don\u2019t think Baylor wants to be investigated by the FBI for discrimination against LGBTQ+ people like it is rn. This is a case where if Baylor was affiliated with a more \u201cprogressive\u201d church like the Disciples of Christ they wouldn\u2019t have to do this. \n\nI understand it is part of the history of the university and at times it has been beneficial for the university but I fail to see how they reach a common ground when both parties would benefit from splitting.

My bad. \n\nSecond: You're likely getting downvoted because you support an extreme position: Baylor chucking its Christian identity out the window altogether. There is another heavily downvoted comment in this thread who supports the opposite approach you do: no compromises with the \"leftists\". \n\nI think most want to keep Baylor's Christian identity (which is what defined it - \"Pro Ecclesia, Pro Texana\"), but to become more tolerant - more moderate. It's why most want a break from the increasingly fundamentalist BGCT.",

There\u2019s plenty like me at Baylor, they\u2019ve graduated from there, they educate there, they attend there. \n\nIndeed I got to those positions through the same religion that fundamentalists want to take to a very dark place. Christianity has a long history, and there has always been incredible diversity in the church. It will continue to be so, regardless of how leaders want to define what a \u201cChristian\u201d is. \n\nBaylor was the first community of Christians I found where there was that incredible diversity. I spoke with Baptists, Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Orthodox, and Eastern Rite Catholics during my time at Baylor. \n\nIt is not that Baylor ought to lose its Christian identity, which I think is harder to lose than you think, but in what ways WILL Baylor be Christian? \n\nAfter Baylor\u2019s scandals, a reckoning with our past will only empower our university to take serious its obligation as a Christian institution.",

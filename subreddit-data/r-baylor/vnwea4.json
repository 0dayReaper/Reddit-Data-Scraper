    "postText": "If you didn\u2019t hear, Baylor is representing as Team USA at an international basketball tournament in Canada July 5th-10th. It is sponsored by (and I assume streaming on) SportsNet, which I believe is only available in Canada. Anyone know any other ways to access it?\n\nShould be fun, and hopefully the tournament continues to grow!\n\n[Team USA](https://www.si.com/college/baylor/basketball/bears-globl-jam-scott-drew-basketball-united-states)",

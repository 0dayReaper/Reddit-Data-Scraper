It helps a lot if you\u2019re a guy, unfortunately the standards for women to get in are a lot higher. Either way, good luck!!",

Do you do any HS clubs? Are you in sports? Do you volunteer? If yes, Be sure to add to your application as it can give insight to how you could perform as a student.",

Pretty sure they don\u2019t consider displayed interest but in my optional essay i did a lot of research about the classes and activities i could participate and impact at baylor. I was really excited to go to baylor and i made it clear in my essay. Not sure if that helps, but overall if you were passionate in your application then they do see that!",

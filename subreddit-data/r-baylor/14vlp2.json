I was poking fun at the event that could have been prevented instead of taking the lives away, only if the people responsible had behaved selflessly in order to ensure the integrity of the structure. That did not happen. Rather, the school was busy to blame on one another after the incident such as blaming on deceased students' high BAC.\n\nI mean obviously by your username, I conceive your affiliation is deep within you and  your school, but that does not grant you any justification of your paralogism and tendency to seek attention here.\n\nI apologize if my words and your perception have caused you some distress.\nHowever, Christian values are integrated in all Baylor students, they're called morality which your administration did not have a decade ago.\n\n",

    "postText": "I am gonna make this message very short. With finals coming along and everything else that\u2019s going, I understand how stressful and overwhelmed you are. But you can do this. Remember there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. Just trust the process and don\u2019t be afraid to fail. Failure is the best medicine to reflect and grow in character. Keep persisting and never let one semester determine your future. I wish you all the best of luck on the upcoming exams and finals.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nMyself and a friend are heading down to Waco for the first time to go to the OSU-Baylor game this weekend. We would like to get a game day experience for Baylor and Waco. Where are the best places to visit for a drink or eatery pre/post game? Best parking spots? On the athletics website, it says there is construction on I-35, if so, are there alternative routes to get around town? \n\nThanks in advance Big 12 brothers and sisters",

If you're real friendly you may even be offered a beer, but you didn't hear it from me.",

I will warn you this is more \u201cChip and Jo\u201d Waco and less \u201cAuthentic\u201d Waco.",

Best bet for parking if you do not want to pay is park downtown then shuttle to the stadium, or you can pick up a ferrel center parking pass for pretty cheap and ride the short shuttle to the stadium. I would reccomend slow rise for after the game.",

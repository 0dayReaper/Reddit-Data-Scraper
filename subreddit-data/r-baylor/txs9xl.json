            "comment": "This is my completely honest opinion, I graduated from Baylor with a BBA degree, had an awesome and wholesome experience that I wouldn\u2019t change for anything, and my job prospects after school have been objectively really good. \n\nI would go wherever it makes financial sense, I wouldn\u2019t go into six figures of debt to go to Baylor. Not because Baylor is not worth it but because Baylor is not worth that much more over an A&amp;M degree (they\u2019re actually very comparable). At the end of the day I\u2019ve seen people struggle during and after Baylor because they took on so much debt, going to Baylor probably wasn\u2019t the best option for them. Meanwhile others have quickly paid off their student debt and have been doing awesome afterwards as well. I was fortunate enough that the my scholarship and my situation were so good that I didn\u2019t get any student debt but that\u2019s rarely the case. \n\nIn terms of choosing A&amp;M or UH, I\u2019d pick Texas A&amp;M unless you feel like you don\u2019t fit or Houston feels like home to you where staying in Houston after school sounds very appealing.",

I took out loans to pay for my last 3 semesters, all paid off now and no regrets but.... Bang for your buck Aggie is hard to beat.  I didnt like the vibe of Aggie, fake military, farmer, wannabe cowboy shit. U of H is an ok school, headed in the right trajectory but you will not have the same types of offers out of school as you would if you went to Baylor or Texas A&amp;M.",

It is super fun if you get into going to football games and participating in the traditions. The people are nice, and it\u2019s easier to find friends imo because of the amount of people and clubs on campus. \n\nBaylor is great too, but i\u2019ve found it hard to make friends here although that might be because I transferred during covid. The traditions aren\u2019t as good as TAMU because there aren\u2019t many people to participate, and most are more interested in greek life events than campus events. It\u2019s definitely not the same community as TAMU. The college experience from my personal pov is that of a very nice community college. BU has the benefit of smaller classes which gives you a better opportunity to make connections with classmates and professors. Within the business school, you are rigorously trained on professional skills and tactics to be chosen out of a sea of applicants for internships and jobs. I can\u2019t speak to the TAMU side of this since obviously i ended up at baylor lmao. \n\nLocation wise: waco sucks. There isn\u2019t much to do here. College station is a really cool city for college students considering northgate and just fun activities around town. Waco has a few things, and a lot more coffee shops if that\u2019s your thing. Waco can also be dangerous if you end up in the wrong spot at the wrong time, but i haven\u2019t had much experience with that since i\u2019m in a gated community. \n\nThat being said, if any of what i said doesn\u2019t matter to you, then it definitely boils down to cost. Baylor is EXPENSIVE. but the curriculum and training that you get from the business school is amazing. TAMU is also well respected and they have the added benefit of the aggie network. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me.",

Either way you should base it off ROI and I've linked below one useful calculator. After looking at it, it appears Baylor would give you a better ROI for your major even with the higher cost, especially after a decade of working. If you are willing to choose a different major the ROI could be more beneficial else where tho.

    "postText": "Hello current Bears,\n\nI committed a few days ago to Baylor, and was wondering if you guys know of any scholarships that Baylor offers that aren't already on their website. I know I might sound naive by posting this, however in my experience during this entire college application process a lot of private universities have had secret scholarships that weren't displayed on their scholarships page.",

First in Line Success Academy is a big help. \nLEAD LLC is a scholarship dorm and you actually walk out with some valuable leadership skills. \n\nAlso, asking does wonders. The First in Line supervisor helped me a semester I needed it. They have money put away to help students with extra scholarships. I think the student success center is the people to ask.",

Sometimes donors make extra gifts that aren't automatic additions, and I got one of those that helped out a bit. Call them up, plead your case, and it's worth a shot for sure.",

    "postText": "Hey all, BuBooks seems to be down again like it was last year. In the meantime, I have started making an archive. Sorry if its not as clean-cut I had to alter some of the original sites to get it to work and I'm not terribly great at CSS/HTML/js but I've gotten several professors on there and will slowly add more as time goes on (Hopefully finishing before next time people need to register). If you all have any suggestions let me know! Its currently very basic I will make it prettier and more user friendly as time goes on as well.\n\nP.S. if you are the creator of BuBooks I am just creating this as an alternative since the original is down and if you'd like me to take it down I will gladly do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: forgot to link [http://baylorprofs.com/](http://baylorprofs.com/)",

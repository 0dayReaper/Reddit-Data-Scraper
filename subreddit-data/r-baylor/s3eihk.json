Part of what makes it so great is that you get preferential registration times; basically you get first pick at professors and class times. It\u2019s a huge help to always have the best professor available for each class. As a resume item it isn\u2019t super strong, but it\u2019s a good way to make friends and get closer with professors. It also opens you up to some unique opportunities which is always good.",

Go to them enough and they will remember you. \n\nIt's not finance but my last 2 jobs were impacted by me having gone to Baylor. The VP I report to has children who went to Baylor. The network itself is strong for life.\n\nEdit: class of '13 MBA",

This is because of Collins being renovated, so Texana and University House are strictly freshmen girls next year.\n\nanyways lol, I recommend any dorm on campus really. U-Parks is across a busy intersection, so you\u2019d be taking a bus or walking if you don\u2019t have a car. What is your major? Some of the LLCs might be appealing to you",

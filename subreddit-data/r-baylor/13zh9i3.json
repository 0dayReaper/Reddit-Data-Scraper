Microsoft office is easier to use on a laptop and you'll likely be using a laptop once you leave school.\n\nAs for windows vs apple I would go windows, again because it's a more useful to be comfortable with once you are out of school. Additionally most programs are made for windows and it's dicey whether they've been ported to apple yet.",

Some of my classmates swore by iPads, but TBH  there a necessary, unless you\u2019re really into art or something. IMO pen and printer paper is goated, and you can really get it all over campus.\n\nUnless you\u2019re going into business, there really isn\u2019t any reason to get a windows laptop anymore.",

IMO the only people that have a compelling reason to go Windows (other than just personal preference) are engineering students that require specific CAD/modeling tools that just work better on Windows (or don\u2019t even exist on macOS)",

    "postText": "Let me explain. I had applied with the ED II to Baylor when my family had a stable financial status and I could partially afford it and decided to take a loan for whatever wasn't covered by the Financial aid and my parent's (little) money. However, going forward due to some personal (family) health issues my parents would not be able to pay for my tuition and I would have to take loans for each year I attend Baylor.\n\nAdditionally, since I had applied for and got into the Pre-Medicine program, I would have to take loans for 4 years straight. I'm an American Citizen but have only lived there during my childhood and am currently residing in Asia.\n\nIs it worth the money? Is there anything I can do about the \"binding\" nature of ED II? I do not want to live out my life repaying the loans I took. I would love to attend Baylor, but the price just scares me.",

This process will probably take about a year since you would be completing many of the basic courses for your program. You could then transfer to Baylor and apply for scholarships. \n\nIt's a pretty expensive school so if you don't have family provided funds nor scholarships,  you will be in a lot of debt from loans.",

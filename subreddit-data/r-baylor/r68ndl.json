You may think it\u2019s only two hours, but trust me you better be mentally strong and fit to take these exams. I remember taking my chemistry exam last year as a freshman feeling completed exhausted after finishing it. It was a 9 AM so I guess that played a role. Remember to take keep your sleep constant, maintain good mental/physical health and eat. Maintaining your health is crucial when preparing for finals. Try to avoid all nighters before a final because even though they help you study the material with more time, you are gonna feel very exhausted and this may make you do a lot worse than expected. So stay fit and I wish you all the best of luck on finals and ending the semester strong.",

In high school, I viewed finals season as the easiest, most relaxed, part of the school year. Not so much in college.\n\n(That said, they're definitely super hard, too, so don't ignore that part)",

    "postText": "Recently moved into a Brothers Management apartment and had to source my own internet service provider. I went with Astound/Grande as it was half the cost of Spectrum but I am already having internet service issues after less than a week of use. The Astound/Grande yelp has many negative reviews, but I know most people who take the time to review are often dissatisfied customers.\n\nHave people had better experiences/reliability with Spectrum in Waco? Thanks.",

Right now I am in a period of consistent reliable service so I would say Spectrum is fine...but there have been months in a row where it goes down 3+ times a day &amp; is frustrating as all get out. That is my 2 cents.",

When Spectrum works it is fine &amp; I just have the standard connection. I am sure you can find people who love Spectrum &amp; hate Grande. \n\nFor the most recent issue I had with my Spectrum internet, it was a hardware failure that seemed to take weeks for them to resolve so you could always call Grande &amp; see if they will give you any information.",

But my parents live in Waco.\n\nSpectrum and Grande both leave a LOT to be desired.\n\nI'm in the process of trying to find new internet for my parents (they are in their 70s.. And I'm well... \"tech support\" from 3 hours away).\n\nSo far the only option I'm thinking is going to be better is getting home internet from T-Mobile 5G wireless hot spot.",

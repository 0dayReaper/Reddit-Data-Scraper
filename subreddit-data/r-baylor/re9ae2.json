We still tailgate together and sit together at games with our families and get together regularly.  Don't worry about which one is \"better.\"  Find one with people you mesh well with.",

Asking \"which fraternity is the best\" is like asking \"what music is the best.\"  It really depends on each person and which culture fits you the best.  Go to the rush events, meet people, and enjoy the process. You will eventually find a fraternity where you feel you belong.",

Baylor does have 2 local fraternities - Phi Kappa Chi (no alcohol at all &amp; Christian) &amp; Kappa Omega Tau (like a national fraternity just only at Baylor). At least that is my understanding of them anyway.\n\nI was in a national fraternity at Baylor that is no longer on campus because membership decreased to the point where it wasn't feasible to remain. I enjoyed my time, played intramurals, ran a committee, made some great friends. It isn't a necessity to be in a fraternity, but if you want to do it as a part of the college experience I am sure you will find one that you enjoy being a part of.\n\nThere are no official houses, but each fraternity usually has a least one unofficial house off campus where members live &amp; parties are thrown.",

            "comment": "I'm a girl but I think fraternities are a great way to make connections at Baylor. There are definitely different people with different lifestyles in chapters. If you go through recruitment in spring, you'll find a house for you. Not everyone in fraternities use drugs/alcohol, but it's a great way to find brotherhood. \n\nFor chapters with involvement: KOT, Phi Chi ATO, KSig Sigma Chi are good. They're the largest chapters, do well and participate in sing and float. They're also consistently good at intramurals and are involved a lot on campus. \n\nOther chapters: delt, pi kapp, SAE: these chapters are a bit smaller and more on the party side. I would say that SAE however is actually involved on campus with float and sing, and that they're more wellrounded. \n\nSmaller chapter: sig ep, beta, teke- these chapters are pretty small. You'll still have your typical brother hood but they are smaller and less well known especially when participating in things like sing, float, and campus involvement.",

Don't worry about one being better than another but its a really good way to make a lot of friends!! There will be members in each that focus heavily on school, members that party, members that do sports etc. so don't worry about that ish",

It\u2019s a great way to meet new people and see familiar faces on campus!! During the time I went to line camp, a good amount (like 10ish people) of the people there were transfers. I will say that most of the people that go to line camp will be students right out of high school but it\u2019s still a great experience to just meet fellow undergraduates! However, line camp is definitely not the only way to make friends so don\u2019t stress to much about it!!",

But last summer I went to the gold group very last week (July 22-July 25) and that had a good amount of transfer! So I would recommend coming to the later sessions because I think a lot of freshman go to the earlier sessions! Let me know if you have any more questions!!",

Most of what they do is annoying and they try to keep everything a secret til you do it and it didn't do anything for me. Don't even know anyone from my group anymore. You'll find friends naturally through classes and campus life.",

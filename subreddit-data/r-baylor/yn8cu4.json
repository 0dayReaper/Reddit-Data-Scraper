For the second week in a row, Baylor has gone into hostile territory as the underdog and come out with a very impressive win. And this is the Bears\u2019 sixth win, making them eligible for bowl placement! \n\n* **Biggest Disappointment:** Third quarter performance was, yet again, a bit of an issue. Baylor\u2019s major sticking point this season has been counter-adjustments as opposing teams make changes over halftime. Several times it has caused such a disruption to Baylor\u2019s game plan that they haven\u2019t been able to recover. Both last week and this week Baylor seemed to suffer the same issues, but was able to pull out the win anyway.\t\n\n* **Player of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* Can\u2019t convince me this should go to anyone other than Sqwirl Williams. On 25 carries he went for 192 yards, with 2 TDs and an average of ***7.7 gal-danged yards per carry***. What a return to the field for Sqwirl!\n * *Defense:* Dillon Doyle takes home the defensive award today. He made big plays when he needed to and led the Baylor defensive squad in tackles. He even pulled off an interception. Even more than that, he kept Baylor\u2019s hype up even when the Sooners were gaining momentum, a critical role to play in a victory like this one. \n\n* **Play of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* I usually give this one to an explosive play or scoring play, but I\u2019m going to have to note Sqwirl Williams\u2019 final rush on the day. After a clear directive from Baylor\u2019s coaching staff, Williams intentionally slid about 10 yards short of the endzone on a breakaway run to ice the game. Two reasons this gets my nod today: First, it was the better move from a sportsmanship standpoint. Second, it was the most ice-cold disrespectful thing I\u2019ve ever seen from Dave Aranda and I\u2019m *here for it*. The move said \u201cI could take more from you, but I won\u2019t.\u201d My whole watch party was in awe.\n * *Defense:* The most important defensive play on the day was easily Dillon Doyle\u2019s interception of Dillon Gabriel on OU\u2019s 3rd drive of the day. It broke serve after two successful touchdown drives, one for either team, and it broke momentum for the home team. This was easily the most impactful moment of the early game, and made Oklahoma respect Baylor\u2019s defensive presence.\n\n\n* **What We Learned:** Well, I just don\u2019t know *who* this Bears team is. We have losses to Oklahoma State and West Virginia, and wins over Oklahoma and Texas Tech in hostile territory. It seems that some of the midseason woes have been corrected, and Shapen definitely seems to be settling in and making wiser decisions. I just hope this trend continues. Let\u2019s make sure the Bears finish the season strong!\n\n* **Next Week:** The Bears make a home stand against the surging Kansas State Wildcats, who at the time of this writing are ranked #13 and are just about to take the field against the Longhorns. \n\n* **Weekly Pickem Winner:** This week\u2019s pickem winner is /u/TheNakedRedditor, with a prediction of [Baylor, 38-34](https://old.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/ykfg2p/football_pickem_boomer_sooner_or_later_edition/iuue7y9/) Congratulations and enjoy your Reddit Premium (and spiffy flair)!\n\n---\n\n*Have anything to add?

I don't think it was a sportsmanship thing, I think it was too crater OUs win possibility from 2% to 0%. OU already showed they could bomb long, why even give them a hint of chance. 1 million IQ play by Sqwirl. \n\nAlso that broadcast though. Hypotenuse yellow line had me dying.",

It's a comedy podcast.\n\nhttps://www.howgaythouart.com/episodes/episode-0-in-the-beginning\n\nClint: Because American Evangelicalism really is an entire culture unto itself. And it\u2019s purposefully closed off from outsiders in a lot of ways. So in the same way that Jey and I missed out on a lot of mainstream pop culture growing up, people outside of Evangelicalism really have no idea what\u2019s going on in this world. Spoiler - it gets a lot weirder than Veggie Tales.\n\nJey: Yeah, let's learn about Jesus with a bunch of vegetables! Oh, my God. Could you imagine a Veggie Tales butt plug?\n\nClint: Well now it\u2019s all I can imagine.\n\nJey: I feel like you could have a Larry the Cucumber with two Bob the Tomatoes.\n\u200d\n\nClint: Or Bob could be a pair of ben wa balls\n\nJey: Oh, yeah, little Bobs.\n\n\u200d\nClint: Veggie Tales really does make some of the darker stories in the Bible a lot more palatable.\n\n\u200d\nJey: They taught us about, like, the genocide of a city via slushies marching around a wall and destroying a city with slushies. And we were just sitting there, like, enjoying these vegetables. Just \u201cYou won't be knocking down our wall, keep walking.\u201d",

No one really expected a different outcome, but it was nice to see our boys in action for the first time this season. Got a few kinks to work out before we take on the Cougars next week, but nothing we can't handle. More importantly, Baylor Football is BACK!\n\n* **Biggest Disappointment:** It's almost a meme at this point, but what is the point of paying for ESPN+ if the production is going to feel like you're watching a broadcast run by the local middle school? Artifacts on the screen, leaving the audio on through a couple of commercial breaks, cameras getting blown out because of their color balance... I mean, at least try a little harder.\n\n* **Player of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* If you want a master class in offense, look no farther than sophomore WR Monaray Baldwin. Stat line gives you 46 rushing yards, 1 rushing TD, and 4 receptions for 84 yds and another TD, but that doesn't tell the whole story. Baldwin was a presence on the field, demanding respect from the Albany defense. Have a game, Monaray.\n * *Defense:* Senior Al Walcott takes the DPotG today, contributing 4 tackles (1 solo) and a beautiful pass break-up in the 2nd quarter. \n\n* **Play of the Game:**\n * *Offense:* It doesn't get much more exciting than a footrace for a touchdown, and that's exactly what we saw from Monaray Baldwin to start off the 3rd quarter: 50 yards, all the way to the house! \n * *Defense:* Bryson Jackson's 1st quarter forced-fumble and subsequent recovery. Great way to set the tone for the game and a nice little boost of momentum for the Bears.\n * *Special Teams:* Can't really write a section called \"Play of the Game\" and not mention Gavin Holmes coming off *two* ACL tears and a torn tendon in his foot just to run a punt back for 72 yards and a touchdown! Welcome back, Gavin!\n\n* **What We Learned:** Wouldn't necessarily call it \"learned\", but we certainly confirmed that Baylor can still whip the daylights out of cupcake teams. \n\n* **Next Week:** Baylor will travel to Provo, Utah to have a friendly debate with BYU over whether Baptists or Mormons are better (at football).\n\n* **Weekly Pickem Winner:** This week's pickem winner is our Presi-King himself, u/gir6543, with a prediction of [Baylor 70-9.](https://old.reddit.com/r/baylor/comments/x1q999/football_pickem_2022_season_opener_edition_4/img1m4s/). Congratulations, you win gold!",

If you want to share your story and possibly be interviewed over it, please email [hauntedbaylor@gmail.com](mailto:hauntedbaylor@gmail.com) My boss and I are trying to find more stories and collect interviews over these stories.",

I was the only person in the building, and there\u2019s no way anyone else could/would have been there. I went into the restroom to pee, and I was in one of the stalls when I heard the main door open and close. I said \u201chello\u201d and heard nothing. I got out and never saw anyone. I guess it could have been someone, but it wouldn\u2019t make sense that anyone else would have even been in the building.",

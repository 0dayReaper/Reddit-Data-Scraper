I want the apartments to look and feel up-to-date because LL Sam's sucks in my opinion. Do y'all have any suggestions based on your own experience or reviews from friends on what the best apartments might be?",

It was a good experience, the repair crew were responsive and it\u2019s fine as long as you and your roommates were clean (which we definitely were not). I heard it\u2019s getting quite pricey though. My sophomore year rent was like 520/mo but i heard it\u2019s much more now.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m doing Hphys next semester. Koutakis has better BUbook rating and I\u2019ve heard scary things about Tandy. But I\u2019ve also heard Tandy is fair, has been at Baylor for a long time, and prepares you super well for the MCAT and Koutakis is easier and new. \nHas anyone taken Koutakis? Does he prep well for MCAT?",

He doesn't curve because you get out what you put in and he's not going to bump your grade since most taking his class are looking at med school he's not going to give you a grade you didn't earn. Maybe I'm just biased since I didn't find his class hard and it's not hard whatsoever compared to med school.",

He had a set of notes that everyone had access to so me and some friends printed it and got it bound at a local printing place and just annotated it during lecture. His test comes straight from his notes and lecture so I found that the best way to have the info needed for studying and all.",

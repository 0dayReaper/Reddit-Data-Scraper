You must have a certain GPA to get in and maintain the GPA and a certain number of hours of community service to stay in. \nOther clubs are more like interest groups, open to anybody. \n\nI can tell you that almost everyone in AED in the years I was at Baylor became a physician and remain my friends to this day.",

    "postText": "I need an extra 3 hours to fill up my schedule and was thinking of taking an art class to fill in that time. I have hand-built ceramics in my plan right now, but was wondering what other people thought would be a good class.\n\nI already have an intro to art credit from my APs and I'm not taking this class for my degree-- it's purely for getting the hours and as something to destress since my other 12 hours are notoriously difficult pre-med classes. I also work, so I don't have a lot of free time and wanted to make sure that this extra class wasn't a huge load outside of the studio. \n\nI generally just want something low-stress and minimal work, and preferably not ridiculously early like the 8AM wheel-thrown class. Any advice?",

You might try calling the Theatre Department or checking in with an Academic Advisor to find out if there is something similar to Theatre Appreciation that is currently being offered.\n\nI also took Theatre Appreciation back in my day &amp; it was a fun, relatively easy class. It does require that you attend a certain number of Baylor Theatre productions, not sure how that would fit your schedule.",

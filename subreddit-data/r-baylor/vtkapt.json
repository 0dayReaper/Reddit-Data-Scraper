I didn't want to break the law,\" Griner told the judge in English, which was then translated into Russian for the court.\n&gt;\n&gt;. . .\n&gt;\n&gt;Sources said the guilty plea to charges of drug possession and smuggling was a strategy to help facilitate a prisoner swap that could bring Griner home, and it also was a recognition that there was no way she was going to be acquitted.",

Or doesn't have the propaganda ability to explain away trading her preconviction. The approval ratings within the nation for the war are 58%, pretty sure they could swing it internally on a political lvl\n\n\n https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-athletes-guilty-plea-will-not-impact-release-talks-with-russia-white-house-2022-07-07/",

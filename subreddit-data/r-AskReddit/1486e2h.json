Someone I know worked at one and they said they generally look for clothing, food, shelter etc and not emotional abuse. They didn't do the home visits though, just stuff at the office. \n\nI guess mothers mental health must have had to be reported as a reason for them to visit? Was there any signs she was unstable before that? \n\nHope your kids are OK now",

That went on for a while before she ultimately broke up with me for \u201cnot being mature enough\u201d though I was the one trying to help resolve the arguments and not get slammed against a wall. \n\nI dated a girl later once I felt less closed off from the last one, and she came across real nice up front. Unfortunately she was consistently manipulated by her best friend, who was IN LOVE WITH HER of all things, so I always got in trouble for no reason, and she got incredibly nasty behind closed doors. She was shy when I met her, but as soon as I gave her confidence she felt powerful enough that she became an egotistical powerhouse. She went from comforting me with my old relationship trauma to using the exact same abusive techniques I told her about, and she knew full well she was doing it. \n\nThat time I didn\u2019t take it though. I took her to a coffee shop, broke up with her, and I left. I didn\u2019t look back and never tried to talk to her again. The entire place looked at me like I was a villain, but I didn\u2019t care. I knew what it all did to me the time before, and this was 2 years of being together. If it wasn\u2019t then it wasn\u2019t ever, do I did it and I\u2019m still glad I did.",

            "comment": "I dated a particular woman for five years. She came out of a very abusive marriage, had not sought therapy, and had no healthy coping mechanisms. She became an alcoholic and often, while under the influence, was extremely verbally and emotionally abusive. She had rather adversarial communication habits as well, sober or drunk.\n\nA lot of this developed over time (she was still finalizing the divorce when we met and began dating). There was an element of \"frog in a slowly boiling pot of water\" to it, for me. And when she was at her best, she was fucking wonderful. It was hard for me to admit to myself how bad things were getting.\n\nIn the end, I didn't leave; she did. I became deeply depressed, borderline suicidal, and very emotionally withdrawn. I was practically catatonic as a partner; I'd come home from work, collapse into a chair in my office, and try to read a book, unable to focus on the words, until it was bedtime. Day after day. I couldn't manage anything else. She chose to interpret this as me being emotionally cold and punishing and withholding, and left in an explosive huff. It saved me.\n\nAll I have to offer in the way of advice is: don't ignore that voice in the back of your head that recognizes red flags early on. Trust that part of your gut. But if you're already in deep, reach out to your loved ones. Also, and this might be controversial - cover all your bases in terms of \"good faith efforts\" with your partner. They might pay off. I didn't do a good job of trying to find ways to supportively encourage her to seek therapy and get mentally healthy, and I wonder if things would've turned out differently. She has since come around and realized how terrible she was to me, but it was too late for us to salvage anything. If I had been bolder and a little more intentional during the relationship, maybe we could've worked through the shit together and ended up with a super strong relationship that has weathered the worst. Instead, I have a laundry list of topics for my own therapist, a lot of bittersweet memories, and an apartment that's too quiet.",

                    "comment": "There's not a whole lot worse than getting into a relationship with someone who has undiagnosed and/or untreated mental health issues. If you do you almost always feel compelled to stay with them because of guilt. And the people around you usually add to that guilt because \"How can you leave a sick person like that? You wouldn't leave someone because they had cancer would you\"? And occasionally that persons family is front and center with the guilt because now that person is *your* problem and if you break up then they're going to have to deal with them. \n\nBut there's no more legitimate reason to GTFO of a relationship than if the partner is suffering from untreated mental health problems. Especially if that person recognizes they're sick but refuses to get help. Because mental and emotional illness is actually quite contagious as you yourself have proven; dealing with a depressed person who does nothing to treat that depression almost always causes the people around them to become depressed. Society needs to stop guilting people into staying with mentally sick partners.",

My ex's former husband was a combat vet. Classic story of \"person goes to Iraq/Afghanistan, completely different person comes home\". Our government sends people to war, war breaks them, and the government does fuck-all to fix them when they get home. Then you end up with people like me, with no relation to the military but suffering the tertiary effects.\n\nI think that people with mental illness, or people who have suffered trauma, can recover with proper support and are just as deserving of love and happiness as anyone else. I absolutely agree that advocating for oneself is very important, but I also don't want to frame it in such a way that it further stigmatizes the mentally ill.",

He also put off some \"I can fix her\" or \"I'm the only person helping her\" or as you state he had a \"Hero Complex\". \n\nAs I said in another response on this post people should never feel guilty about leaving a relationship for any reason; even if the person has serious mental health issues. While society tends to frown on people who leave someone who is sick at the end of the day only you know what's going on behind closed doors and if a crazy person is making *you* crazy too then it's time to leave.",

Looking back, she was probably bipolar, but after a while the kindness went away and she would call me names or put me down on some stuff. My mom was abusive towards my dad and I didn\u2019t want to be like that so I ended it and just told her that it wasn\u2019t working for me. She said it was fine and that was pretty much about it. We only dated for a few months so it wasn\u2019t like it was too serious anyways",

            "comment": "My ex was a narcissist, however for years I just assumed she would grow up, and grow out of her ways. She was selfish, always wanted her own way, had different \"rules\" for us both, changed the goalposts often, was hypocritical, rejected all my suggestions no matter what they were. She was very jealous, especially of my family and was horrible where my kid was concerned.\n\nShe's very charming though and (most) people liked her on the surface, but in common with narcissists, she was purely interested in impressing strangers. There is far too much to list here, but lets just say I was treated like I simply didn't matter. She was a textbook narcissist - she did literally everything you see and hear about narcissists in that exact order and style, seriously.\n\nShe got worse and worse after a new job and subsequent promotion. She was obsessed with her immediate male superiors and clearly wanted two of them before she finally settled on the third (that I know about) who finally caved into her. I knew they were carrying on, but had no proof until one morning when I was contacted by someone who told me what was going on. It wasn't even an upsetting moment - it was the excuse I needed to end the relationship\n\nYet still I convinced myself we'd get over it and tried for the next couple of months to get things back on track. After insisting it was over, there were several \"work trips\" where she would go missing, lie about her whereabouts, be late back and so forth. After one such occasion, we were on our way somewhere, and she started to goad me about something and nothing, to deflect my questioning of her lateness home. I turned the car round, took us home and didn't speak to her for the rest of the night. \n\nThe next morning whilst she was in the shower, I packed a bag and left. This was actually the third time I'd left her, but this time I realised that once I'd told my family, there was no going back. So I told her I had left and where I was going, and I headed to my family to tell them everything. That was it. Over. \n\nSince then, I have had, literally, two types of response. Those who were surprised and upset because, in their eyes, she was gregarious and fun, and those who absolutely weren't, because they could see she was fake as fuck and witnessed her appalling behaviour. \n\nYou only realise how bad things were after the event, and many things only become clear after the event. It's hard to leave - after all you don't just switch your feelings off - but it does get better over time.",

            "comment": "She was fresh out of a 3 month treatment program after being heavily addicted to meth and heroin for 10 years (since her mid teens). Still, I found her attractive and she had the most magnetic and alluring personality from the day I met her. I'll admit I had a bit of a rescuer thing going on and that I'm usually attracted to girls with BPD. She had it, and I knew that, but I didn't know how bad it would become. She seemed sweet, funny, sensible, and had a bit of an edge to her that was alternative or rebellious and I found that refreshing. \n\nShe moved in with me pretty much immediately after finishing treatment. After our first fight over something petty, she became more and more emotionally and psychologically abusive. She promised to stop but never did. \n\n9 months later I abruptly said one day \"we should break up then\" during a fight and she definitely didn't expect it. She had me so controlled, always bending over backwards for her - even I didn't think I'd ever get the courage to leave. But that morning I had enough and just blurted it out.\n\nShe tried everything: begging, crying, blaming, taking blame, manipulating, more crying, gaslighting, the usual but magnified to 100. She even asked if we could keep living together as roommates.   \n\nI tried to get her on the first flight home, even showed her how using a discount airline would be way cheaper than driving. She insisted I drive her. She wouldn't accept any other option. So I cancelled work for 3 days (at her insisting) and almost lost my job because of it, drove her the whole 8 hours to her hometown, saw a couple good buddies and then took the dog she left me with back home another 8 hours. \n\nI'd never felt so relieved.",

I found nobody gave a shit, very few people seem to actually care about male victims of ... well, anything. Nobody's gonna come save the guy, nobody's gonna reach out and talk about things, nobody will take you seriously, so you gotta go through it on your own and she basically has no consequences from doing what she did, because nobody believes you anyway.

Every problem in our relationship was my fault and every bad thing that happened that she couldn't somehow pin on me or someone else would \"work itself out\". She had zero self-awareness and it seemed like she was completely incapable of taking responsibility for her own actions.\n\n And because of this when she got mad she'd throw tantrums that included actually throwing stuff. At me. She would fly off the handle, start hitting me and then tell me to hit her back. Considering the fact that my own mother was sort of an abusive loon I had no idea on how to handle this at the time. Eventually she ended up leaving me after a few years together and when she did I realized how awful she was but I still wanted to be with her lol. Eventually I moved on but she tried coming back a couple of times.",

I had to constantly be ready for her to throw something at me simply because she was upset. She would pick borderline violent fights in the middle of the night when we would try to go to bed, only for the fights to continue well into the early morning. I had the cops called on us multiple times because neighbors thought I was the one abusing her when it was very much the other way around. I thought I was being a good guy because I could take it, but after about 4 years and waking up multiple times to her threatening me with a knife over a dream she had, I was done. I told her parents I was leaving her. I gave her everything in the divorce just to get out of the marriage as quickly as possible. From that point on I only communicated to her through my lawyer because she wouldn't act that way if others could see her behavior. It took me years to get over that treatment. I was three years into my relationship with my now wife, and 6 years following my divorce, still flinching from any sudden movements my now wife would make. 12 years into our relationship I think I have finally calmed down. But it took me quite a while to completely get over that knee-jerk reaction to have to defend myself from who I assumed loved and cared for me.",

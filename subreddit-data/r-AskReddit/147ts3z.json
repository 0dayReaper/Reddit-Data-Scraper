I was working as a mechanic at a ford dealership miserable af with a gf and 2 year old and one day decided this isn\u2019t the kind of life i wanted forever, so I went to the local Air Force recruiter and enlisted with ATC guaranteed in my contract.

Everything else in my training seemed abstract from lectures or I was just shadowing the doctor without feeling like I was really part of the team. But holding a newborn baby and handing him over to his mother is something I'll never forget and reminded me of all the hard work it took to get to that point.",

The truth is if you do what you love you make yourself a target for mistreatment. People know they can use and abuse you because this is your dream. They know that if you leave there will be kids lined up at the door to take your place. In the end you will be burnt out and not even know if you love the thing anymore. \n\nBetter to go the route of seperating work from personal life. I don't need to be happy at work. I go there to make money so I can live my fullest life when I'm home. I can do the things I love as hobbies on my own time and at my own pace. It's a much better balance and much less stressful overall.",

Yeah I mean it's gone up too but it's well below market value.  \n\nMy parents got a McMansion on the outskirts of Phoenix in a very affluent suburb in 2010 right after the housing crash for $330, 000.\n\nThe little three bedroom two bath starter home that was built in 1994 that I had to move move out of during COVID because the landlord jacked the rent up from $1,300 to 1800 over 24 months. And I was still just an apprentice at the time not a journeyman electrician yet. I looked the other day and it's up for sale on Zillow for $390,000 it's $1,300 ft\u00b2 and almost 30 years old.  \n\nThe house mom talking about them my parents got for $330,000 in 2010 has marble flooring two stories four-car garage with three garage doors.  Cherry wood cabinets you know just a nice little McMansion and it's a nice home $3,800 ft\u00b2.  Nice and ground pool outdoor kitchen they put $50,000 into landscaping the backyard so I had that to the 330k. but still.\n\nUs elder millennials and especially you younger millennials we were just born at the wrong time.

Bought a house in 2020 with only 5% down and the mortgage was around $1,750. $400 more for my own house with 3 bedrooms and a yard vs one little apartment. Not to mention I'm earning equity on an appreciating asset instead of renting where you might as well just burn that money and throw it in the garbage.",

The people who can afford to live in these places want to keep their communities \"better\" then surrounding areas, which only continues to maintain the price or drive it up even further.\n\nWhen you start putting low income housing and business all over the place, then you don't have a separation between \"the ghetto\", where you can actually work, and the upper class. Now those high cost of living areas won't be perceived as automatically better and thus more expensive by extension.\n\nTowns need to be planned with an intentional mix of classes to keep the perceived value from running away from the cost of living. Businesses will naturally follow places that are middle class or upper class because businesses bring in money by design. So that means that everybody who wants to partake also be a high earner but we know that Americans are not paid a fair working wage so they are really just a trap. You can either get the job and then pay a lot or waste your time commuting. It was only allowed to get to this stage because of poor city planning, think too much capital coalesce in one area then creating a barrier to entry. They only get to the stage because of the perceived value of their location being better than others around them. Things that are always perceived as better cost more.\n\nImagine if businesses that raked in a lot of money were spread out. Silicon valley doesn't all need to be in one spot. The fact that it is makes it more expensive to live there just based off that.\n\nEvery time somebody has a NIMBY moment, they're actually making their life harder in the long run.",

Tax implications are handled at retirement, either take a lump sum payment and be taxes X% on it, or be paid out over the course of a few years for X% tax on it. \n\nThere's like 3 or 4 different accounts that my retirement goes into, including profit sharing plans and other stuff, so it's hard for me to track down. But when we had 3 people retire one year they had to set aside just over 3 million bucks to buyback all their stock, and that kinda payout sounds good to me. \n\nSeriously, ESOP is where it's at, I do not bemoan my company Presidents status, he's getting the same deal I am and that dude has to do just as much engineering as I do.",

            "comment": "I've worked with dogs my entire life. There's two moments that stand out to me. Once was working at an animal shelter. There was a dog that I didn't really care for, not for any reason, she just didn't stand out to me. It was freezing and we were outside, I was just closing her kennel door and she darted out. She fence fought with her neighbors and then ran around the corner. I yelled her name and \"come\" and she stopped dead in her tracks and slowly walked over to me. I picked her up (dropped my leash to follow her) and carried her back, no issues. My coworker told me that she was close to being euthanized because she wasn't responding to training and was too dangerous to other dogs to be adopted out. Her listening to my recall command saved her life. From there, I took on most of her training. She was the last dog I walked before I got fired from there and I miss her so much. She was able to get adopted out, but she was such a sweetheart.\n\nAnother time, was at my next job at a doggie daycare. We had an older dog, either 11 or 12, come to us once a week. He was the sweetest dog and the first dog I met there. His name was Whitey and I remember one day, I had a terrible coworker who would yell at you if you didn't follow her schedule exactly. She yelled at me, calling me names like \"useless\" and such. I was in the yard and just started crying. Whitey jumped on the playscape and stood there, as I cried into his shoulder. I pulled my face away and he gave me a kiss. He passed away a few months later and I miss him too.\n\nI'm currently jobless but I do plan on working with dogs again. I don't think I could do a normal job after everything I've seen.",

The \u201cmoment\u201d of sorts was when I was able to calm down a tantruming 2 year old with nothing more than a couple things I read from books and knew from experience. But it was like a magic equation. I needed to solve for X (calm the child) and knew how to combine XYZ to get there. And it worked immediately. And I thought, \u201cdamn, I really am good at this, aren\u2019t I?\u201d \n\nIt was an awakening of just realizing that I\u2019m naturally good with kids. Naturally have the patience and compassion, and find the joy so easily throughout the day. There are of course bad days where I end up on the couch 4 shots deep watching Friends, but for the most part, I really do love my job and see myself doing it for the rest of my career.",

Moving around means you make more money since they have to offer you something when you take another job.   It also makes you more valuable to your employer\n\nI never stop trying to learn something new.  I'm currently taking college programming courses to get into a job writing code.   I'll probably stay at this employer since I make decent money and have vacation built up \n\nWhen people say you need to work hard to get ahead they do not mean bust your ass, work a ton of hours, or and get more work done than others.  It means work on yourself to make you more valuable to your employer.  People who stay in one job forever will make less than those who move around and learn new things.",

I then package everything in an easy to understand packet for the the installer.   \n\n\nI currently work for a giant globo cabinet manufacturer as one of their product / design experts. I have about 400 kitchen design shops, contractors, ect that I act as a source of information for. I generally help these clients when they run into weird situations or need layout / design help. I make a nice hourly salary + a nice flat % of anything my accounts sell (Home depot is one to give a taste)  \n\n\nI'm currently opening my own design company so I can double dip as a side hustle. When I do that I would generally charge a design fee, then markup a nice double digit profit on the cabinets themselves. I also want to have a show on HGTV one day so I can play a total tool on televisions (it would be funny to me)  \n\n\nThere are so many different ways to make money in this industry, you can open a design shop, do layouts all day for contractors, work for a major home development company as their cabinet designer / purchaser.   \n\n\nStarting in the industry you will generally work for about minimum wage for 6 months while you learn, eventually you will get something that will pay like 12 an hr + a few % of the profit on the sale. However when you start making commission you will learn that ANY mistake you make will come out of your pocket and paycheck. Incorrectly measure a wall by 3\" and you can kiss a months pay goodbye. However you eventually get incredibly good at your job and will develop a network of people who absolutely rely on you to do their jobs and make their income and you on them. Eventually you will float through a bunch of showrooms, counter top shops, ect until you A) Open your own business B) work for a major manufacturer because if they hire you that means you wont sell other peoples products.\n\nI'm an expert in RTA cabinets, Semi RTA, and fully custom cabinets but less so as custom cabinet makers tend to work for themselves and are like gnomes",

Then later I started to get more studio work by word of mouth. \n\n5 years down the line the studio scene started to die off slowly and I switched to touring. Fast forward 17 years later I almost completely quit touring job and moved to production, working in my own little studio. That\u2019s where I am right now career wise.",

I loved VFX, I loved all of it - but it had never seemed like a real career that actually existed.  I floundered when I got to college, I bounced around to a few different majors. Math, Compsci. IDK.\n\nOne day I went to the art building, to see about becoming an art major, cause I was just DONE with compsci and didnt know what to do - and I got lost, and ended up in the small corner where the animation classes were. I started talking with the woman who ran the program and everything just sort of clicked. Like 'This is where I'm meant to be'. \n\nIts sort of a jack-of-all-trades degree. You need the art to be able to animate well, but for the computer animation side of it, it helps to be able to program, to write scripts to procedurally animate things. You need to know math so you can write create equations for curves into your scripts. Or like - If you want a wheel to rotate and move across the screen at a certain rate, write a script and need math for that. Or cogs interlocking and rotating. Lots of things that are better with scripts and equations.  I needed to know physics to understand how the world worked to animate it right. I needed to know film and composition to make an animation well. I needed to study EVERYTHING and I enjoyed it. I love to learn.\n\nAnd when I met the other students in the animation program, and I clicked with them in a way I'd never CLICKED with people before. We were the SAME TYPE OF WEIRD. It was like a revelation when Id always been a bit of an outcast. I'd fit in okay with some of the other major groups I was in, but something was always a bit off - but here I found MY people and I knew it was where I belonged. \n\nI knew I found my calling - I was doing something I loved. I knew I found my people, these people were the same kind of weird as me. I fell in love pretty quickly. The first year I was in the program and realized it was everything I wanted.",

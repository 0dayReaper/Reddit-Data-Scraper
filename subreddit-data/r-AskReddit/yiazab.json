That decline is more about having accidents (I've broken my hip and my ankle in the last 5 years) which have taken more out of me with the healing process.\n\nI keep saying I'm going to get back into it (I've been exceptionally excited to return Wrath of the Lich King), but working retail on top of those things...my battery simply does not recharge the way it used to. So even though I'm home at 6pm most nights, I spend the rest of night trying to control the pain of exhaustion.\n\nHowever, as I write the above I feel I'm simply making an excuse for myself to sit in my rump bemoaning my sore feet.

Even Washington, who was offered a Kingship of America, said that 8 years was enough for any one man to be in charge.  The founding fathers chose prosperity of their states and the country over personal prosperity.  Five signers of the Declaration were captured by the British as traitors, and tortured before they died. Twelve had their homes ransacked and burned. Two lost their sons in the revolutionary army, another had two sons captured. Nine of the 56 fought and died from wounds or hardships of the revolutionary war.  What kind of men were they? Twenty-four were lawyers and jurists. Eleven were merchants, nine were farmers and large plantation owners, men of means, well educated. But they signed the Declaration of Independence knowing full well that the penalty would be death if they were captured.   These were not wild eyed, rabble-rousing ruffians. They were soft-spoken men of means and education. They had security, but they valued liberty more. Standing tall, straight, and unwavering, they pledged: \u201cFor the support of this declaration, with firm reliance on the protection of the divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.\u201d",

Its not Free.\n\nI get looks from others my age, when I say, fuck this,...I'm not waiting till 67 as I've been employed since my working papers at 15. I know I might lose money taking SS earlier at 65 but I have seen friends/colleagues that worked till 65 and die, missing their pensions and SS.  I'd rather lose a few hundred a month than not be around to enjoy it. (SS is really an insurance and I hope you all have either a pension or retirement account)\n\nFuck the decision who said we Americans can't retire at 62 but instead 67. And I bet they push to 70 next , as medical advances (see drugs, etc) will not make you just live longer to enjoy life, but to work.",

He'd explained that he did industrial for a long time but didn't really like it.  Said the pay is good but the work sucks, but he actually gets paid better doing custom homes.  He said he's getting paid about $150 an hour and his company is billing him out at about $350 an hour.\n\nWhen he told me that I told my son maybe he should rethink the whole college thing. lol",

He\u2019s got a union position at an industrial plant as an electrical maintenance engineer. He\u2019s been there since 1995 and can\u2019t afford to retire. He had to have his hip replaced last year, mom has health issues, and the health insurance is too good to give up just yet. My parents are working middle class and didn't get enough education in financial literacy to know how to save for retirement. \n\nDad half jokes he\u2019ll have to work until he dies, but at least now he\u2019s starting to talk about retiring and moving closer to my family to see his grandkids.",

When I first moved to WA I had to sell cars to make ends meet until I got my IT gig.  We had so many longshoremen come in and they'd pay cash for really nice cars.  Definitely the envy of all of us folks on the lot who would never afford a ZL1 Camaro on that salary.\n\nOne of the guys there had a dad who was a longshoreman and he was telling me that he was working on getting in the union and he was grandfathered in because his dad was there, but that he had to put in so many hours before he could join the union.  So if he wasn't selling cars he was at the port of Seattle putting in time loading boxes.",

Lots of new Catch-22 policies that the company put into place and seemed to like using against drivers that were only a few years away from retirement. For example, they've always had a \"no speeding\" policy, but later added a performance metric for average delivery times that was practically impossible to achieve without speeding. So they would either get you for being too slow, or wait for you to catch a speeding ticket. We had similar conflicting policies in one of the manufacturing jobs I worked where maintenance workers had to abide by lockout-tagout (LOTO) before entering any of these machines to troubleshoot a problem, and yet, doing that would cut all power and air to the machine. They were also judged on average downtime metrics for their performance reviews. So let's say that my machine has an air leak in one of the hoses (happened almost every other day in the summer due to extra heat, no climate control, and old/patchwork air lines). Usually it's an external line or one accessed by removing an outer panel, no big deal. But sometimes, it's an internal line, and you can't feel around to find the exact section of busted hose without climbing inside to feel around for it. You follow proper LOTO procedure and you can no longer track the leak. You're in a position where you can either play by the rules and completely fuck the downtime metrics that directly effect your next raise by visually inspecting every line in the vicinity inch by inch with your fingers and a flashlight to find an almost invisible slit, OR gamble your safety by entering the machine with the power on and air blasting through a leak that you can pinpoint in 30 seconds or less just by putting your hand in the vicinity of where all of that noise is coming from. Guess which procedure became the standard. At that point, if you ever really want to get rid of someone, all you really have to do is spy on them for a day.",

Even if only to $200,000, so that it matches the cap for Medicare payroll tax. Or, to not piss off upper middle class voters, do a donut hole thing where it kicks in again at 500k or something. Sad that such a simple fix seems like a pipe dream.",

From a money perspective, my in-laws are financially better off than my parents.  My mother-in-law is also a spender herself.  \n\nI find it hard to imagine my father-in-law not working though.  If everyone retired at 65, that would be a wonderful society, but the reality is far from it.  So many people cannot survive on social security and need to seek additional work to survive.  Some folks want to keep working just to keep working.\n\nAll of that createsa  job market that can be sometimes difficult for new and younger workers to get in, but here in the US what are we doing to support our older population.",

If you can only be in Congress for 12 years, maybe 20 if you jump from House to Senate at just the right time, then knowledge of previous decisions has to come from somewhere else. Luckily, there's already a niche for former members of Congress looking to stay in the DC area: lobbyists. Hard term limits would make lobbyists an even more important facet of the system and grant them implicit power.\n\nI would argue that the House of Representatives and *only* the House of Representatives needs term limits. That means every Rep would wants to stay in Congress has only one avenue--stealing a seat from one of their Senators. That means that every Senate primary and every Senate election would be an all-in competition as ambitious people all fight over a set that any only one of them can have.\n\nInstitutional knowledge is preserved in the Senate, and every Senator had a real fight ahead of them every year, so complacency will get them shit canned.",

It recognizes the value of institutional knowledge, gives successful reps a place to go, and forces reps in safe districts to actually do something.  \n\nHere in Colorado we have Doug Lamborn (R) and Diana Degette (D) as examples. They are in very safe districts and do little other than reliably vote for their party. It's rare for them to even use their safe seats to push for something that's harder for tossup reps to get behind.  \n\nThis plan could solve quite a bit on the front end. I think age limits would still be a useful cap on the back end.",

There are some members who don't try and create a national profile to run for higher office, but instead they learn the ins and outs of the legislative process. Doing that can take a few terms in the House and probably one term in the Senate. You'd lose too much of the institutional memory that's important to actually keep things running as they should.\n\nI'm all for retirement ages and shortening the campaign seasons. I'd also call for independent commissions in every state to draw districts rather than leaving it to partisan state legislatures. Too many people are sitting in safe seats so all they have to do is become more fringe to survive their primary and are more or less guaranteed the general election after that.",

They couldn't stay on long enough to gain the experience needed to govern effectively, and they couldn't learn enough to have a complete understanding of the issues in front of them. \n\nIn addition, it's ripe for political positions to become a corrupt pipeline for people to move from office into an executive role in industry. For the lawmakers, if they're term limited to a short window, they have little incentive to serve their constituents (because they won't be in another election) and a perverse incentive to kowtow to industry interests in order to set themselves for a cushy job post leaving office. And on top of that, they keep their connections in the statehouse and become the next round of lobbyists to a new generation of inexperienced lawmakers.\n\nI wish term limits were a simple, effective solution towards repairing our political institutions, but the issue is significantly more complicated.\n\nAlso experience and being beholden to your constituents are good for governance, actually.",

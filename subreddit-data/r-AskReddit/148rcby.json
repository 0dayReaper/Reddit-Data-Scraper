I still think if he hadn't been so greedy, deceitful, and arrogant the people working for him could have seriously used his companies resources and connections to invent even greater things and do even bigger projects. Those contributions could have helped further humanity under his name and he would have even reaped more as a business man. I think there is some intelligence involved in appreciating what you have and deciding not to let your hubris get in the way of things but I suppose intelligence can be measured in a lot of different ways. If I remember correctly Nikolas Tesla went from Edison Co to work for Westinghouse which at the time eventually ran out of money to pay him for all his work but Nikolas Tesla continued to work for them based on his own principles and the fact that Edison had screwed him out of so much money and credit for his work. (I'm just going off the top of my head based on what I remember reading as a kid. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong)",

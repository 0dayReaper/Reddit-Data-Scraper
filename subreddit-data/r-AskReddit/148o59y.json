Because of that I'm surpressing any thoughts and feelings on cheating myself on my girlfriend (unofficial finance) automatically. The only thing coming close to \"cheating\" under my circumstances are, looking at another woman's boobs. Not really what you wanted I guess, but a true and serious answer",

We met a lot at his apartment with one of our friends to study and some days I slept there on the sofa. More than once we nearly kissed but I alway turned back until I finally ended my relationship with my bf. The next day we kissed.\nHe wasn\u2019t interested in a relationship with me and at first that really hurts but at the end I\u2019m thankful cause he gave me the last bit I needed to leave my than-bf (who as aggressive and manipulative).",

            "comment": "Married 10 years, never cheated. Had a situation in which my wife thought I was cheating though, and the other woman involved eventually wanted to have an affair with me (she was also married.) But I didn't want that, and didn't ever pursue that..\n\nThere was a point several years back, about 2-3 years into my marriage. I was working about 48 hours a week, and the woman who got my the job there was a mutual friend of my wife and I. I'd started working their just before I got married, and it was a point that my wife and I started having a lot of issues with our own marriage. Our friend that I worked with was also having issues in her marriage and she and I would talk over lunch from time to time. Probably not the greatest idea, but this woman had become one of my closest friends over the years.\n\nMy wife started getting suspicious over \"how much time I was spending at work.\" But in reality there was nothing going on. We needed the money, so I put in the hours. My wife and the friend would also talk about mutual marriage problems because, again, we'd all mutually been friends for years at this point. One time while those two were talking, my wife made a complaint about something her and I had fought about recently, and our friend let slip a comment to the effect of \"Yeah I heard about that.\" And thus my wife got pissed about me venting about our relationship to the friend, which I countered back with something to the effect of \"you found that out while doing the same time.\" It was a mess, and my wife only got more and more suspicious while a whole lot of nothing was happening in reality.\n\nEventually the friend did decide to leave her husband and made a pass at me at work one night wondering if I'd consider leaving my wife to be with her instead. Which I said in no uncertain terms \"no\", because I wanted to try and repair things with my wife before giving up on it.\n\nThen the friendship deteriorated quickly and I got really upset about the whole situation because I hadn't cheated, I hadn't done anything but talk to my friend from time to time and put in extra work hours to pay the bills, but it hurt my marriage anyways, I ended up losing/cutting contact with the friend over it and changing jobs, and it took a whole lot of relationship counseling to put things back together again.\n\nOne of the things I think about from time to time is that it was our spouse's (My wife and the friend's husband.) constant suspicion while nothing was going on that actually lead to something almost going on. Because I was getting sick of the accusations to the point of considering leaving if my trustworthiness was going to continue being constantly questioned with no evidence or reason, and our friend developed an attitude of \"well if they're going to keep accusing us all the time when we're actually just providing incomes and having a friend to talk to then we mine as well be guilty.\"\n\nRemember that jealousy and suspicion can be a poison to your relationships people.\n\nEDIT: Thought I should point out if it was clear from my marriage lasting another 7 years at this point, My wife and I did manage to put things back together and rebuild trust in each other, It just took time and effort and marriage counselling. But things are really great now. I hear that a LOT of couples have trouble around the 3 year mark, so if youre there and the honeymoon-feeling is wearing off don't lose hope, you've just reached a point where you both need to restart putting the effort and care in to keep the flame alive.",

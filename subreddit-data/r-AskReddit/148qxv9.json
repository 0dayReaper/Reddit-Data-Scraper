And some sort of mechanical battery that spins to store energy would lose most if not all of it to friction and other energy losses. To answer your question, can you push a sail boat by leaning over the back and blowing real hard?",

Talking micro-Newtons into, while we need Mega-Newtons out to move 4ppl+~1600 lb. vehicle. \nThe limitations would be crippling to the idea and prevent it from even being made, much less at a profit.\n \nNo, it could not compete in ANY market, like, at all.",

            "comment": "Putting aside the ability of the car to even move, you would need a massive amount of energy to wind up the spring. You\u2019d need an electric motor, ideally, to do the work. The amount of energy put into winding the spring would be more than the energy eventually going to the wheels, so it\u2019s more efficient to stick the electric motor in the car. If you wound it by hand, you\u2019d need a shedload of cogs in a gearbox to be able to transfer the feeble strength of your arm into the spring. Imagine turning a crank 100 times to store enough energy to turn the wheels one rotation.\n\nThe other problem is the size of the spring. Tiny little toy cars don\u2019t have space for tiny people and tiny bags of shopping, which is why they work. They also do not travel very far.\n\nCould it compete in the market? Yes, very badly. You\u2019d be better attaching a sail.",

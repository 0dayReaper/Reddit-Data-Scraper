If they just ignore them without good reason, they get kicked out.\n\nOnce we have enough morally-just members, we'll spread our influence through messengers, using the same methods of guilt-tripping and questioning morality to grow without much resistance. And the head leader being charismatic and seemingly only led by positive motives only adds to the credibility of the cult.\n\nYou won't question it, you'd be a madman for questioning what's right.

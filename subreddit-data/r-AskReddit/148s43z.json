For example let's meet up at 20:00 for some soccer at the playground. Fast forward and you had no idea who would show up and how many before you actually arrived. But always good times!\n\nIn 1997 and the years after we started to get internet and ICQ. It helped a lot that you could communicate with instant messaging (or SMS on phones)",

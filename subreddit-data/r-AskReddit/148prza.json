I had been drinking since I was 14 and so had most people I knew. For Americans- the legal drinking age is 5 in England as long as you are at home in company of adult. You can drink at 16 accompanied with drink so long as it is ordered by an adult I think. The drinking law is more to do with purchasing and ordering it yourself. \n\nAmerica was just weird anyway everyone was too friendly especially as this was during Trump time, I thought people would be angry like us british.",

            "comment": "1aauto.com\n\nIt is a car parts supplier, but their videos show exactly what tools you need, what parts you need, and how to do a repair yourself. Great money saver if you don\u2019t know much about mechanics. Someone I knew was going to get screwed by their mechanic (700 bucks for a water pump replacement). Showed them that, they did it themselves for 30 bucks. It makes it quicker too, knowing what tools you need ahead of time for your particular car.\n\nEdit: I agree they\u2019re not the best for parts, this was just about their videos. For parts, rockauto.com is great. If you need an item quicker and have an Advanced Auto nearby, order online and pick up in store. They almost ALWAYS have a coupon online for at least 20% off, which you can apply and pick up in store, around 30 minutes later, yet save quite a bit versus just going in and buying.\n\nLast edit: For those that are not mechanically inclined and do not want to mess with it, use Repairpal.com when you receive a quote and make sure the price is reasonable. It will give you a pretty general idea of what you should be paying in your area. It\u2019s not 100%, but will help keep you from getting ripped off. Unfortunately, there are a lot of shops that will take advantage of a situation. Not saying all, of course, but that way you will know for sure. Thanks for the silver, as well!",

We're not trying to sell our science, and most of us don't give a flying fuck if the journal makes money off of our articles. Our currency is mostly citations, so we care that more people see our work.

Generally pays 50-90 cents per minute captioned, depending on the video. There is also just plain audio transcription, but I don't do that work.\n\nEdit: WHOA! I got a TON of PMs from this!! I'm sending everyone that PM'd me details on this. So if you want the details, be sure to PM me. I might not get to everyone today but I'm trying to. I'm pretty much just copy and pasting the same message to most of them. A little detail: yes, it is work from home and yes, you set your own hours. This job really, really helped me when I was in hard times. There have been two times in my life where I've found myself suddenly and unexpectedly unemployed and, since I live in a rural area and there's not much need for I.T. personnel around me, it took a long time to find a job. I worked for this place full time while looking for a new job, and it was FANTASTIC for me. I LOVED it. I even talk about it in job interviews now :D Anyway, if you are interested and you PM me,  you will get the details. I hope you are accepted, and I wish you best of luck. I really hope it helps you as much as it's helped me :D",

My first two semesters of college I went through Amazon/on campus bookstore and then discovered LibGen because of Reddit, meaning I bought maybe $150 worth of textbooks for the rest of my undergrad totalling only about $500ish for all four years. \n\nUnfortunately it doesn\u2019t work for everyone since more classes are having online access codes nowadays. My roommate was spending ~$1000 on textbooks a semester solely for the access codes because his business classes all used them.\n\nEdit: Mods removed the original comment because it linked directly to the website which is probably against Reddit TOS. It\u2019s called Library Genesis so hopefully isn\u2019t hard to find. Alternatively, PM me and I can PM you.\n\nEdit 2: Just to clarify, this is piracy and not just cheap textbooks or anything and there is the chance that they won\u2019t have your book/the link for the download doesn\u2019t work.

We were told the only way to get the syllabus, and therefore all of our assignments, rubrics and book lists, was to purchase an $800 packet that contained the books we would need, the syllabus and about 30 printouts for assignments. We even had a two hour in-service from Elsevier and they mentioned that $800 packet about fifty times in that time, just to make sure we knew about it. Well, turns out the students from the semester prior to ours were the beta testers for that packet and they organized a FB group to let as many people know that we could:\n\n1. Have the book lists from them, for free, and therefore could buy each textbook at heavily discounted prices. \n\n2. They told us which books were utter shit, and which ones they found to replace the crap ones. \n\n3. And finally they told us that a week into the semester all of the syllabus and assignments became available online for free, but needed to be printed out from time to time. \n\n**what a crock of fucking bullshit**",

There's a cap on how much total money will be given and that amount will be divided between all the people who signed up.\n\nThe settlement set aside a total of $31 million to give to affected people who signed up to receive the $125. That means that you'd only get the full $125 if 248,000 people or less signed up. There were 147 million people who qualified and could have signed up. If even just 1 million people signed up then you're only getting $31. If 5 million people signed up (only about 3.4% of those affected) then you're only getting $6. They stated that signups were \"overwhelming\" so I'd bet the number was even higher than that.\n\nTL;DR You'd be lucky to get $5 from it. I'd be on somewhere around $1. In other words, the Equifax settlement that exposed you to identity theft will likely give you less value than the Red Bull settlement that gave you a case of Red Bull for free, which is a giant fucking middle finger to all of us poor people.",

All you need is a library card and a PIN, which you'll probably need to get in-branch -- but really, is there ever a *bad* excuse to go to a library?\n\nThe selection might be limited, but if you want to splash out a little, you can get a year's out-of-state access to Brooklyn Public Library for $50. That's not as good as free, but it can be a lot cheaper than using Audible, especially if you get through audiobooks at a real rate.",

A search on YouTube would also lead you to find tons of free tutorials to try and maybe build a hobby on. There are also loads of free add ons and lots of other content from other Blender users. The Blender stack exchange is REALLY active too, so if you get stuck on trying to make something, feel free to ask and you would usually receive an answer in very little time.",

They all have free apps as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[privacy.com](https://privacy.com) is AWESOME, I absolutely love their service. It allows you to credit credit cards on the fly that are site specific, set a spending limit on them, make them one time only, etc. So you can literally create a separate credit card for every single site you shop on, and be very comfortable in knowing that if they get hacked, your card isn't compromised. Its also super handy for \"free trial but must enter CC\" type things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Mint.com](https://Mint.com) \\- Great budgeting site from turbotax (So if you have problems with them, don't use it) - it allows you to create a budget, then automatically categorizes transactions from linked accounts to show you how you are doing with regards to your budget. Its easy to setup and adjust, and really helps to monitor where your spending is going\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Lastpass.com](https://Lastpass.com) \\- Everyone should be using unique passwords for everything, which means you need to remember them, which is impossible. [lastpass.com](https://lastpass.com) is a great tool that manages them for you.",

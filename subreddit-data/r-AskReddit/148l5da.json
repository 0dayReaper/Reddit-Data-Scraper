I've been holding a special interest in a certain book series lately, and I've constantly been thinking about it, and its brought me lots of anxiety that I couldn't just talk about it and also being in that world, since I don't really like talking to others about my interests, as well as my ADHD making my thoughts one jumbled mess. It was to where late last week I was very despondent.\n\nSo I just opened a Notepad and began reading and writing, just infodumping everything. 2 days ago I spent like 3 hours on it, yesterday I spent 9 hours (including distractions and short breaks) and I will do more today. It has alleviated a lot of my anxiety and I feel happy doing it\n\nSo my biggest regret of past 72 hours is not doing that sooner when my anxiety levels were maxed out.",

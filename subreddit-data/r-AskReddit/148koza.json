The bride puts the grooms wedding ring on the groom's finger. \n\nAlso, often the womans engagement ring and wedding band are created as a set and they nest perfectly together. After the wedding you take the set to the jeweler and have them attached together into one ring.",

I figured some of it had to be extensions or something, but I honestly had no idea how realistic wigs can be (my only experience prior with wigs was those shiny neon ones for Halloween).  \n\nI remember always complimenting them on their hair and commenting how I loved how they changed it so frequently; like to match an outfit or something. I asked how long it would take them (I was picturing hours in a salon after work) and they rightfully laughed at my stupid ass and showed me that many of them were wearing wigs. I was just floored. Couldn\u2019t believe the realistic hair-parts in the wig hair that looked like it was down to their scalp. We had a good laugh about it!",

I was always so impressed with how she managed to tame her hair to that slick shiny mane and one day I told her if she could give me tips because I can never get my unruly hair to stay down (didn't say it like that, it was just the reason for me to ask). At first she was angry because she thought I was shaming her but when she saw my blank dumb sheep stare, she said: you know that's not my actual hair right?' I swear, you could hear the crickets in my brain at that moment and then the cogs starting to turn slowly. To be fair, before that I had never had any contact with black people (growing up in rural Germany in the 90s) and then moved to London. Suffice it to say, there were many things I didn't know but this one was by far the most embarrassing.",

He had a whole plate of shrimp and I jokingly said \"Ugh, I don't know how you eat that shit, knowing it's whale sperm and all\" after that, he acted disgusted and shoveled the shrimp to all of us, which we gladly ate. \n\nFast forward 7 years, this guy called me and said he hadn't been eating shrimp for 7 years because he thought it was whale sperm and just looked like an idiot for mentioning it in a business meeting.",

Late in the game I was born, my parents only natural child.  I was told from an early age that being adopted is exactly the same as being a biological child and that it's perfectly normal and a lot of families have adopted kids. I was told that there is absolutely no difference between us we're all the same. But along the way I guess I got my wires crossed and thought that every family was a mix of some biological and some adopted. I was probably 13 years old when I realized that our family was a bit of an anomaly.  I was in literature class and we were reading a story about a troubled child who had difficulty dealing with being adopted and I remember asking the kid next to me \"how many of yours are adopted?\"... Talking about her siblings and she looked at me like I had horns growing out of my head.  This led to me asking the teacher and I stayed after class that day and we talked about it.  That's also when I realized exactly how hard my parents worked to make sure that my sisters and brother felt absolutely loved.",

I came to the realization that they can in fact fly when I was delivering furniture, and seen some ducks on a roof. My dumb ass asked the driver how the ducks got up there, and after he got past the shock of my question he explained they can fly.",

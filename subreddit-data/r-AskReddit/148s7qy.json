            "comment": "For me, the phrase \"once a cheater always a cheater\" doesn't mean if someone cheats once they will always cleat or become a serial cheater. \n\nIt means that once the cheating is done, it can't be undone. They will have always cheated. \n \nGetting cheated on is one of the ugliest feelings in the world. The betrayal is visceral. But it isn't always so black and white\n\n. I'm not so quick to judge someone for cheating. I had a friend whose ex-husband was extremely abusive and neglectful. She couldn't escape right away due to money but she did meet a woman online who was in a similar position as her. They developed a long-term casual romantic relationship. And because her ex couldn't do the bare minimum for her, she would invite this woman to work events, social events with our friend group etc. No one ever judged her. The woman was lovely, and they supported each other through their shared trauma.\n\nMy friend was able to finally divorce her husband. She now lives in DC with a new husband and is happy (and faithful) with him. She's still close friends with the woman she cheated with and her current husband understands and supports the friendship.",

Yeah it would suck, but what about throwing everything away over a one time fuck up?\n\nOf course, I wouldn't want to let somebody do it to me again, but if it means I tried to mend things, and they'd I'd it again? I'd drop them quick.",

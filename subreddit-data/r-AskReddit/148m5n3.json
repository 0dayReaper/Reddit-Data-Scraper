            "comment": "Reflecting on the past, I've come to realize a significant regret: I dedicated an excessive amount of time to work and neglected the opportunity to witness my children's growth during their formative years. My ex-wife, being a stay-at-home mom, allowed me to focus on working long hours, including taking on a second job, just to make ends meet.\n\nHowever, this relentless pursuit of financial stability came at a cost. I missed out on invaluable moments of seeing my children blossom before my eyes. It pains me to acknowledge that I wasn't there to witness their milestones, to be present as they took their first steps, or to experience the joy of their infectious laughter.\n\nNow that my kids have grown into adults, our relationship is strong, and for that, I am grateful. We have a solid bond, and we spend quality time together. But deep down, I can't help but feel a sense of longing for the time lost during their early years. I yearn to have been an active participant in their lives, to have been present in the everyday moments that shape a child's world.\n\nDon't let the demands of work consume your life to the extent that you overlook the importance of cherishing moments with your children. Be present, engage with them, and relish in their growth. Those fleeting moments, those memories, are truly invaluable. Once they slip away, there is no way to recapture them.",

I become the leader of the company at a very young age and I spent too much time thinking only on money and living out my family and my friends. To make you realize what monster i was: i asked to install a bed in my office to not lose time. There was a period( 6 months) where I was working 20 hours a day and sleeping 2 hours. The CEO gave me 1 month of paid vacation to take care of ny mental health. In 8 years i became the CEO of the company and I realized that my desperate run to make money was wasting my life. I learned a very precious lesson: time is money,and is true, but no amount of money will gave me back time. Now on my office door there is a photo of me in that terrible period to make know everyone what money can do to people.",

I called her not nice names and he put me in the hospital for 3 days. She sat and watched. Denied it happened for years!",

Then when the devs add a bunch of features and people stop using it, they can't articulately explain why, but they say say other apps feel better to use. \n\nWhat users actually want are tightly designed products that are designed to be used the way they want to use them. They don't want to sit at a giant control panel of options. \n\nAnd the devil of the thing is, they don't know that's what they want. But they do.",

Tenderize, fry them up make gravy out of the drippings and serve with mashed potatoes. The whole meal probably cost less than 5 bucks in 70s dollars, and I'm telling you nothing tasted better. I made it for my kids when they were growing up and they still ask me for it sometimes.\nShe would be 94 today.\n\nLove you miss you mom.",

We call those little flat desserts cookies. They\u2019re also good, but biscuits are DELICIOUS.\n\nEDIT 2: since you guys are so fascinated by biscuits, my grandmother also made the other type of biscuits (cookies). They were called teacakes and they were amazing. I haven\u2019t seen them outside the southern US, so I think they\u2019re a regional thing.",

It's different from the ramyun as it has no broth but its easily one of my families top 3 foods. If I can find the Amazon link to the instant brown noodle packages I'll make an edit but it's a serious recommendation if you're a fan of Asian noodles.",

Any canned soup becomes a heartier meal with some rice in it.. pasta is really good if you cook it up with a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of tuna.  Basically anything with rice, egg, bread, canned veggies, and even canned soups is cheap and filling as fuck.  For less than 5 bucks you can have like a 4 day container of stew with rice, some kind of soup flavoring, a veggie added, and egg.  Its somewhat nutritious and can taste decent.  If you want to splurge an extra dollar buy a soup like Amy's.  They have a lot of veggie and lentil soups that at least feel less processed than some of the other brands, and you can stretch that out for a while.  Also canned potatoes are less than 2 dollars and they go a long way to make a meal heartier.  If you want to go super cheap and put in the effort, a sack of potatoes is super versatile and can be the foundation for several meals.",

Costs just a couple bucks to make and feeds an entire family of four\n\nEditing to add the full recipe \n\n\nI use Goya season all, and I generally put it over farfalle noodles but fettuccini works really well tho\n\nSo the general recipe I follow is as follows Brown ground meat with salt and pepper with a dash of Worcestershire sauce Once that\u2019s browned add in a can of cream of mushroom and a duck huge dollop of sour cream, fill the fan with milk and add that too. Then some more Worcestershire sauce, some a1, and like a tablespoon of your favorite mustard. Season to taste with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder and whatever else you think sounds good. Serve over noodles. I also suggest putting some Parmesan cheese over it when you eat it cause it\u2019s good.",

The pasta sauce is the most expensive part, and if you make it, and the English muffins at home, each mini pizza is like 30 cents.\n\nEdit: So, I need to call out my privilege here. I grew up broke, but I grew up adjacent to an affluent white neighborhood. Produce isn't dirt cheap (or even available) everywhere, but it should be.",

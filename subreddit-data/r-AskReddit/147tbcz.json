When found out, he was immediately incarcerated. When he was tried, the truth came out that his condition resulted in this behavior. But because he did it, they still had to send him to prison - even though they got a plea deal down to 1 document, it was still 13 years on the charts and guidelines they use for sentencing.\n\nThere has never been a former President or Vice President who has willfully retained such documents (see Biden and Pence having said \"please come get these things\" and opening up their places to searches and investigation - seriously and openly). obstructed an investigation, obstructed justice, bought a federal judge, committed espionage or concealed and tampered with such documents.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether or not the documents were classified. Under the Espionage Act, they simply have to pertain to matters of the National Defense, which all of these were. Every document he hid and kept (all 30 boxes full) should be considered as a separate count of each and every one of these charges because he endangered separate groups of lives with the exposure of each document.\n\nI also agree that the seriousness of these charges against someone in whom the public has placed the highest degree of trust in the most powerful position in the world should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. I say this due to the abuse of power and willfully ignoring the laws that govern their conduct and handling of said documents - simply because the culprit has been rich all their life and is accustomed to breaking the law without consequence is no reason to be lenient. In fact, the exact opposite is true - if ignorance of the law is no excuse, then ignoring the law you not only know know to be fact, but are repeatedly advised of its application &amp; severity - that's cause for increased sentencing. Particularly after being personally involved in increasing the severity of such a charge (in the case of 18 U.S. Code \u00a71924) from a misdemeanor to a Class E felony and then continually lying to the public and the press about it - that person needs to be locked away without any means of communicating publicly, IMO.",

Milley had gone on record talking about how he had to convince Trump not to attack Iran while he was president.\n\nIt seems that Trump was pissed at that which is what led to the transcript.  Trump was showing them plans to attack Iran and claiming that they were made by Milley and that it was actually him who wanted to attack Iran.\n\nHowever, anyone who knows anything about national defense is aware that the US has plans to attack many nations drawn up and regularly reviewed and updated, but especially hostile states which would be more likely to attack us or our allies.  So of course there are plans for an attack and invasion in Iran.",

(He has also apparently \u201cdiscussed group executions.\u201d) According to a person familiar with the matter, late last year, Trump \u201cprivately mused\u201d about \u201ccreating a flashy, government-backed video-ad campaign that would accompany a federal revival of these execution methods.\u201d The videos would reportedly include \u201cfootage from these new executions, if not from the exact moments of death.\u201d  \nAll of this is, of course, entirely believable: At a rally in October, he told supporters the government should execute drug dealers by shooting them, and then \u201csend the bullet to the family\u201d and make them \u201cpay for the cost of the bullet.\u201d To that end, a former White House official told Rolling Stone that Trump \u201chad a particular affinity for the firing squad, because it seemed more dramatic, rather than how we do it, putting a syringe in people and putting them to sleep.\u201d This person added: \u201cPresident Trump would explicitly say that he\u2019d love a country that was totally an \u2018eye for an eye\u2019\u2014that\u2019s a direct quote\u2014criminal-justice system, and he\u2019d talk about how the \u2018right\u2019 way to do it is to line up criminals and drug dealers before a firing squad.\u201c  \n**During his time in office, Trump oversaw\u2014and demanded\u2014the execution of more people than any other administration in more than 120 years, and his administration executed more Americans in a one-year period than every state combined.** His was also the first administration since the 1880s to put people to death during a lame-duck period, and in January 2021, when it was clear Joe Biden was going to become president, executed three people in four days. In an interview, former attorney general Bill Barr told Rolling Stone that had Trump won a second term, more people would have been put to death. Presumably, should he win in 2024, that will happen to at least some of the 44 people currently on federal death row.\"\n\n[https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/02/donald-trump-guillotines-firing-squads-executions](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/02/donald-trump-guillotines-firing-squads-executions)",

                            "comment": "My toxic girlfriend is coming over tonight to have a talk after an ugly week long fight. I am so unhappy in this relationship. She has hair traumas that she\u2019s never dealt with (jumps from relationship to relationship). I have invested a year and one month into this relationship I am drained. Tonight is the night.\n\nUpdate: she came to talk. We went on a walk outside because I didn\u2019t want to create a scene in front of my house. She kept insisting that I talk first because she was anxious and wanted to know what I had decided but I made her go first because I already knew what I wanted so I wanted her to talk first to see what she would say. Long story short she FINALLY acknowledged all her toxic traits and the reasons why she had done some of the things during our relationship. She said that she knew exactly what to do to fix all those things so that she can be a good partner. After she was done I asked her how is it possible that you all of a sudden have figured out everything that\u2019s wrong and solutions. She said she deeply reflected and realized she has severe anxiety issues. She feels the need to control every situation and if anything is out of order it triggers her. She\u2019s been cheated on and she\u2019s also cheated in her last relationship. Her dad also cheated on her mom when she was young so because of all that she thinks men are all pigs. Throughout our relationship, I\u2019ve invested countless sleepless nights trying to console and reassure her about anything that would trigger her. Some examples. She accused me of having feelings for a mutual friend after having dinner with them and while I was driving she hit me across the chest really hard. We\u2019ll be working out in the gym and if I look in a general direction she would accuse me of checking out girls, she said it\u2019s weird to look at people and that I should just look down at the floor while working out because there\u2019s girls walking around in leggings. She has forbid me from going to music festivals with my friends because she claims girls are half naked and that would be basically cheating visually. A new show named the idol came out recently and I was really excited to watch it but she went off on me for watching it because it had nudity. There are more examples that I can\u2019t recall right now but the show having nudity in it was the final straw for me. That night she lost her shit on FaceTime and literally was screaming at the top of her lungs so I decided to hang up the phone and block her number for the night. The following morning I unblocked her, told her I need some space for a week to process everything. After us not talking for a week I realized how happy I am and how peaceful my life is without her. So yeah that\u2019s the story. It took 3 hours to break up with her last night. She was crying and begging me not to. She has been texting me all day today begging for one last chance. Omg wow as I am typing this she has showed up at my house. She\u2019s currently outside begging me to come talk to her. God this is so hard because I do care about her and I hate to see her in so much pain. But I know I have to stay strong for myself. Also thank you to everyone for your words of encouragement and advice. I read every single reply &lt;3",

I was doing inventory in the supply closet when I heard my crush and several of his friends talking about me and wondering who I was dating. Because apparently I had to already be dating someone.  One of the guys asked my crush if he'd ask me out, the guy *laughed* and said he didn't have a snowball's chance in hell, so he'd skip the humiliation. The other dudes agreed with him.\n\nAnd... I was just sitting there on the other side of the wall with my clipboard and a box of junk going... WTF?!?  I started paying a little more attention and realized I got talked about a *lot.* It was *infuriating.*  How could my dating life be utterly non-existent while guys were having those sorts of conversation about me?\n\nSo... A couple months later, I walked up to my crush on new year's eve at midnight, kissed him, and told him we should go out.  I know I went a bit too far in the other direction from passive behavior, but it worked.  He wasn't really coherent for the next half hour, just smiling and staring at me, but we were officially dating the next week.\n\nBeing proactive was generally a very positive thing for me.  Men were almost always absolutely thrilled to be asked out, picked up, and taken on a date.  Yeah, I met a few nutters who responded by calling me a whore, because women aren't allowed to make the first move, but the benefits were worth it.",

Women, they LOVE it do not be afraid.  My boyfriend raves about how I flirted with him so obviously and kind of teased him and then asked him out lol.  And I have done exactly that in probably 75% of the relationship I have had.  Men like when you pick them and have a lot of confidence and just make it really fun for them to be hit on, and you don't have to be self conscious about it bc believe me they love it.  They hardly ever have this happen to them, usually they have to do the work.  And it also just sets a really good tone for the relationship because you're going to ask for the things you want, overall.",

She was exactly my type, friendly, funny, intelligent, cute as a button, and when she smiled my heart skipped. My friends agreed that as far as we knew she was single and she seemed a good fit for me, and they got sick of me talking about her. One day four different people said \"just ask her out!\" to me on the same day (including one of _her_ friends). That was enough to tip me over. So I plucked up all my courage, pretended I had confidence, approached her in the library where she was waiting for her next class, nervously initiated some small talk, told her I wanted to ask her a question. I said I know it's probably really obvious, but I like her a lot and asked her if she would go on a date with me.\n\nShe took it amazingly well. I applaud her to this day for how she handled it. She told me I wasn't super obvious, but she did have a feeling I would ask. She explained that she has a boyfriend, but she's still glad I asked. She said she admired the confidence it took to come and talk to her and ask her out, nobody had done that for her before, and if she wasn't already in a relationship she would have said yes. She gave me a nice big hug, then we went separately off to class. I was so happy and proud of myself for doing it. I came to class smiling so much my friends all thought she'd said yes.\n\nOf course you might be thinking \"was there _really_ a boyfriend?\" Was that just an excuse to let me down gently? When I explained the events to my friends they said \"what boyfriend?\", and even one of her friends said \"she has a boyfriend?\". Turns out she is just really private about that stuff. The next week I saw her in the computer lab sitting on the lap of a guy I'd never seen before. She introduced me to him, he goes to a different uni and came there to help her study. She was in a relationship with him the whole year, then she didn't attend the following year, I think she moved to a different town.",

I remember the first time I told her my feelings and she didn't really give me an answer for a long time, but we continued on like normal for months until we finally went on a (really good) date.\n\nSometimes the timing isn't right, sometimes people don't want to risk losing a great friend by dating, and sometimes it's a combination of the two. Of course, it could just be a lack of interest, but there are many reasons someone might take awhile to respond.",

If you're always the one fighting before the relationship even starts, then it's not a good sign. It's not the others persons fault, but they will always see you as a back up because despite what they do, you're always crawling back and giving them attention. You're worth more than that. Have some pride in yourself and find someone that actually wants to be with you. No one I've seen in a successful relationship is constantly chasing the other person for affection.",

That really hurt. Felt like I gave up so much for them and it turns out they wouldn't do the same for me. I'll never move for love again. \n\nAnother thing about this relationship, and a warning to others, is that if a person says they hadn't spent enough time being single before y'all got together just break it off so they can do their thing. While it might be hard to give up on something good, the feeling of regret for not getting to experience more opportunities and meet more people will constantly be in the back of their head.\n\nI could go on but the tl;dr is to have clear communication: That also means that if someone tells you something actually *listen* to what they're saying and don't just hear what you wanna hear (a lesson for myself right there).",

Staying in a dying relationship doesnt make breaking up later any better, doesnt make you happy now. Also (not my personal fuck up) but marriage and or kids wont fix a weak relationship. If its dying and nobody really cares, get it over with and move on.\n\n3- not mine but ive seen it firsthand enough\u2026 some people have issues, and while these arent dealbreakers themselves, you shouldnt enter into a dating relationship for the purpose to be free therapy or to fix them/date people that will fix you. People need to be in a place where they are able to date others, not go looking for someone to fix them or prey on broken people. And if you are with someone that becomes too much baggage, you can stay to help, you can leave if it gets \u201cabove your pay grade\u201d. You have to make sure you are taken care of too.",

At first I thought the problem was everyone was more experienced but later, I realized they were mostly jaded because they'd been dating 10+ years and not had great luck. You get written off for the most innocuous shit but usually that's them doing you a favor. \n\nI did find someone who wasn't what I'd call jaded but it took months of focus, hard work, and a month or three of premium on hinge, okc, bumble, and cmb just to keep the process and my interest from stagnating. There is hope but it isn't easy these days. My gf and her family are opening up my world-it's worth it!!!\n\nAlso bumble is a scam too easy to never speak. We met on OKC but hinge has the best app.",

We figured it would be easier for her if she stayed at mine when she was working, and when she wasn\u2019t she could be back at home.

            "comment": "I matched with this girl on Tinder a few years back. In our conversation she told me she was on a temporary visit in the country and that she's staying at a hotel. We agreed we'd meet outside the hotel and go for a drink of coffee at a nearby Starbucks. When I reached the front of the hotel, she didn't exactly walk out of the hotel, but in fact, someone had dropped her at the hotel (that was the first red flag). As I greet her and introduce myself, I suggest we walk for a bit and make our way to Starbucks, but she was adamant of a nearby cafe that she's pointed out across the street and I was like \"ok, sure why not\". The rest of the date was comprised of just getting to know her and what she's doing here on a visit and while this was happening, she proceeded to order wine numerous times and kept walking back and forth to the restroom (second red flag). And by the end of our 2 hour long date, the bill came and I presume it was going to be atleast a $100+ billing, but to my shock, it ended up costing me $560+, and I reluctantly paid for it as it is customary where I'm from that guys pay the bill if you're the one who invited the person to the date. And when the bill was paid, she wanted to go clubbing and I told her \"sure, let's meet tomorrow night and go\", but I just ended blocking her and deleting her contact info. I found out later that this is a common scam that happens in my country and apparently the cafe and her are both in kahoots, she drags in the victims and the cafe artificially inflates the price of their menu to overcharge me... The worst part, this was the first ever date I went on and it took alot of courage for me to put myself out there, and after that date, it fucking broke me and I felt so violated that I haven't went on a date since.",

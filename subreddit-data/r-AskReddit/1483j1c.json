Bring a bottle of rubbing alcohol and some paper towels and wipe down every door handle, the toilet seat, the toilet lid, and common surface. I don't care if it sounds extreme or paranoid -- I have gotten so fucking sick from staying in even the most deluxe/elite hotels and I refuse to put myself at risk anymore.\n\nThen I try to figure out the shower knobs because those vary like mad from place to place and nothing's worse than not being able to get the water to work when you need it to. I resist the urge to take a bath because it usually isn't clean enough to do so.\n\nI also check the base of the mattress for bedbugs, too, just in case, and inspect the blankets and bedsheets. The blankets usually get tossed to the side in favor of my own comforter because I know the blankets aren't washed as often as the sheets regardless of how nice the hotel is.\n\nAs much as I enjoy the idea of staying at a hotel in theory, in practice it's so stressful. Ugh, and I have to do it Friday for medical procedure. Thank god it's just one night.\n\nCan you tell I hate traveling?",

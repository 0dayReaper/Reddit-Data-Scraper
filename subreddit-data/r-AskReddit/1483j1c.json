We get paid minimum wage and guests are often either making a mess on purpose because they know they don't have to clean it up, or they live in filth and think their mess is a normal amount of mess. Probably at least 25% of guests leave shit and/or blood stains on the sheets, and this is a nice new fancy hotel. Yesterday I had to throw away a pair of underwear someone decided to let me deal with that was full of poop stains. I can't even count how many used untied condoms I've found in the bed or on the floor. Every single one of the housekeepers are refugees or immigrants like me, so we have low job prospects and this is about the only job we can get. I am constantly physically and emotionally exhausted at the end of the day and I'm so burnt out. We regularly get 25 rooms a day. Yet we're still required to finish all the rooms. Corporate can't seem to find more workers for some reason. Can't figure out why.",

Bring a bottle of rubbing alcohol and some paper towels and wipe down every door handle, the toilet seat, the toilet lid, and common surface. I don't care if it sounds extreme or paranoid -- I have gotten so fucking sick from staying in even the most deluxe/elite hotels and I refuse to put myself at risk anymore.\n\nThen I try to figure out the shower knobs because those vary like mad from place to place and nothing's worse than not being able to get the water to work when you need it to. I resist the urge to take a bath because it usually isn't clean enough to do so.\n\nI also check the base of the mattress for bedbugs, too, just in case, and inspect the blankets and bedsheets. The blankets usually get tossed to the side in favor of my own comforter because I know the blankets aren't washed as often as the sheets regardless of how nice the hotel is.\n\nAs much as I enjoy the idea of staying at a hotel in theory, in practice it's so stressful. Ugh, and I have to do it Friday for medical procedure. Thank god it's just one night.\n\nCan you tell I hate traveling?",

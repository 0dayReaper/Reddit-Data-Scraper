If you know can you tell me if it also protects you from having your data secured if you log into a website? Let's say you have an account on something like youtube or twitch or amazon or whatever website. Does it still protect you from the websites getting your data and selling it? If yes, then that is impressive and I don't know how they do that. Might switch if that is the case. Or is there another way to not have those sites get your data?",

I can tell you I've done security audits that show none of my online profiles have been associated with data breaches.\n\nI run a clean ship. I'm sure stuff slips through the cracks (because I'm not maniacal about it). Part of my procedure is buying into the Apple ecosystem, where there is at least an attempt at limiting access, compared to other vendors.",

Thankfully my accounts have not been affected by data breaches yet. But I am lucky on that front because I don't really even try. But privacy is always a good thing. Everyone has different things they find important. Some find privacy important and me personally I find freedom important. Being able to pretty much tell my phone what it should do and being able to download anything even if it's not on the app store is what I can't give up anymore. But of course some just don't need that and for those I think Apple is actually a better experience. It's just easier and more refined than android. Everything has Pros and also Cons depending on what you need or want a device to do",

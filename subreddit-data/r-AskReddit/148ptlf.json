I have a daughter who's 14, we've had some issues with schoolwork not getting done and a couple times she was lashing out verbally, but nothing with substance abuse or physical violence.\n\nA lot of what we do is trying to be accessible and approachable.  We don't demand respect in the old-fashioned \"yes sir, no ma'am\" sort of way.  And when she does act inappropriately (she recently made a cruel comment about a physical feature one of us is sensitive about) we went and talked to her.  \"Hey, that wasn't alright.  That was really hurtful and uncalled-for.\"\n\nSo... I mean, being a teenager is hard.  Our approach does involve cutting her some slack and a degree of \"I get it, being a teenager can suck.\"\n\nOurs is generally in a better mood overall if we go out of our way to find time to share interests - specifically, *her* interests.  Without judgement.  Sit down and watch one of her favorite TV shows, and keep raised eyebrows to ourselves when the off-color humor comes up.  And, in fairness, a lot of it is pretty funny.  I sat down and read through one of her horror themed webtoons (Stagtown, if anyone's interested), it was pretty good and I think she appreciated being seen and engaged with in that way.\n\nBut yeah, I guess creating some noncombative space, some non-judgemental room for her to explore a little - it's a very explorative time - might help give her room to feel more comfortable with things.  I'm not saying you'll be able to become one of her school friends - that's simply not a role a parent can take - but you can still make yourself someone she can be flawed with.\n\nOur approach probably isn't for everyone and wouldn't work with every teen.  Maybe it's completely wrong for your situation - I don't know.  I can't know.  But it's something we've had very good luck with.",

I sincerely hope that's not what happened with your kid, but either way, neither you nor your family members deserve to be treated like this, and if nothing else, therapy is a good way to at least diagnose the problem and figure out a way forward.\n\nAlso, if you have any other children, check in with them. My sister in middle school started like what you're describing, and I ended up spending six years in a house with the screaming, cursing, fighting, slamming doors, police visits and arrests, runaway attempts, eventually physical violence, all from my sister directed at my parents. I made myself as small as possible so my parents would never have any trouble from me, but I did not come out the other end of it OK. Ended up stunting my social and emotional development because of it, and came out with depression and anxiety for my troubles.",

And in some situations, there's nothing you're going to do that makes a difference. \n\nEvery person is sort of a unique case. You can't treat people all the same. They're not. Some kids respond well to boundaries and punishment. Others resent it and lash out. You could set expectations and boundaries for her and not bail her out when she's in trouble, but depending on her mindset she might see that as more reason to feel resentful and angry at them. Or she might straighten up. \n\nThe best option is family therapy for everyone. Group and individual. A neutral third party can work out what is really happening and try to help worth through it. \n\nBut sadly, in my experience, there's no sorting some people out.",

I'd always have a big one from like 1-2 in the afternoon and the rest of the day was a drag. \n\nNo headaches! I thought I had really bad migranes, turns out just caffiene and almost never have headaches anymore. \n\nI have no scientific evidence behind this, but on top of having less digestion/stomach problems my period cramps are significantly less painful and it's the only change I've made in the last few months that correlates.",

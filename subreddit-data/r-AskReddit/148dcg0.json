Any way, they managed to get the largest of the dildos stuck to the 3rd floor outside window, of one of the classrooms. So the male assistant principal gets a ladder but its not quite long enough so he's teetering on the top of this ladder trying knock a 2 foot long purple dick of the side of the school with a broom handle. She said he was beating that thing like it owed him money and it was just bouncing around, flopping and banging against the window. While everyone watched through tears of laughter.",

In my class there was a class clown we called \u201cBig Zac\u201d who sat at the back and always got in trouble for talking, laughing too loud, being an all around nuisance for her. He got sent to detention a few too many times for his liking and so he brought a bottle of Liquid Ass to her class.\n\nIf you have not had the pleasure of experiencing the overwhelming foulness of Liquid Ass, allow me to fill you in: one spray is enough to stink up a room. Two is enough to clear it.\n\nBig Zac proceeded to unscrew the cap and EMPTY THE BOTTLE ONTO THE CARPET.\n\nThe stench was so bad, one girl threw up, another fainted, and we had to clear the school. Literally an entire section of the school had to EVACUATE because the smell was too much. They ended up having to cut out the carpet in her room, her room was basically almost unusable for the rest of the year so we moved to a different room. Big Zac got In School Suspension (ISS) for I want to say almost a month.\n\nI still almost bust a gut laughing about it to this day.",

He insisted on having me be his VP, to the point where he got all the necessary signatures for me to run without my knowledge and just went ahead and signed me up.\n\nWe had to write speeches to get other kids to vote for us, and those speeches had to be approved beforehand by some faculty member. So I wrote a very disparaging speech about the validity and purpose of student counsel, laden with curse words and personal attacks towards our administration, thinking it would get screened ahead of time and they would disqualify me.\n\nI guess no one actually read my speech and just rubber stamped it, so on that morning they pulled me aside and handed me a printed out copy of my speech. I went ahead and gave my speech and I guess none of the faculty knew what to do because no one stopped me but they were clearly panicked and furious.\n\nI got a lot of laughs and applause. I assume it was too late to print all new ballots because when we went to vote my name was crossed out with a sharpie. I also got suspended for 5 days despite my explanation that I did not want to run and submitted my speech for approval, on time, fully intending to be disqualified. I was also told by some older student counsel members involved in the ballot counting process that I won by a landslide due to write ins and people just circling the black line of my name, but I have no idea if that's true.",

If I remember correctly, the explanation at the time was that the voltage fluctuations had overloaded the power distribution box in front of the building and the streets that were supplied by it were then without power.\n\nFrom today's perspective I am rather surprised that there were no redundant replacement distributors for the streets served by the power distributor.",

They had to go into each yearbook and cover that page with purple duct tape (to match the color scheme).\n\nPrior to him being arrested, I was getting bullied horribly. None of the teachers or other staff could get the kids to stop, but once the staff who was arrested said \"leave Spencer alone,\" the kids would immediately stop. I later realized he was threatening to take their weed away if they bullied me, and that's why he was the only one who could get them to stop.",

You haven't had hilarious until you've heard the principal blurt out from outside the door \"Corner him! No the OTHER way, the OTHER way! DAMN IT where's a lasso when you need one?! C'mere you little son of a b\\*tch!\"\n\nBilly the Goat was eventually cornered and caught, and the kid who did it got a decent scolding and a detention and a whole lot of laughter from his classmates and several teachers, who were just happy nothing got vandalized that year.",

There was a hallway running the width of the school, probably 50ft long and 12 ft wide, with lockers on either side and exit doors at either end. Hard flooring (polished concrete? Linoleum? Idk something like that) \n\nGuy in the grade below us brought in a massive tarp and put it in his locker, knowing the school had to keep these exit doors accessible and the graduating class could get in. So they came in at class break, rolled out the tarp, slip and slide across the hallway and out the other door. Whole thing took under 5 minutes. \n\nThe police were called, they drove to a guy's house to find him and some friends inside and arrested them. These guys did not participate in the prank. Was gonna charge every last one of them with vandalism and criminal trespassing until some people came forward to \"take the blame\" . No charges were ultimately filed because it was soap and water on a floor with a drain, not graffiti. And trespassing? School was technically still in session and the seniors hadn't graduated so they were students.",

            "comment": "2 Senior pranks at my high school that caused the cancellation and warning letters for future senior classes that pranks were no longer allowed. \n\nFirst one involved the Seniors dumping nails in the Senior parking lot so no underclass students would park there. Had several flat tires, including mine since some of the nails crossed over into the underclassman parking. The principal called an emergency meeting, had the staff call all senior students threatening that they couldn't walk or graduate if they didn't come out to help clean it all up. \n\nSecond prank, which was much funnier, involved several Seniors breaking into the school during the night and dumping gallons of Crisco oil all over the hallways. This one was funnier because when I got to school that day, people were all standing out side and the doors were locked and students were trying to figure out what was going on. Looked inside just in time to see a Janitor and a coach slipping around on the floor and then both of them falling down! They actually cancelled school that day and the only way they could continue school was to bring in tons of cat litter and put it in the hallways to soak up all the oil. We had to walk on that mess for a week before they finally got it all cleaned up, but even then there was still some residual oil and the floors were still slippery, so they covered the halls with temporary carpets. \n\nBoth of these pranks were in back to back years and my school the next year sent out letters to all parents and students with a dire warning that any senior pranks attempted or otherwise would result in having to repeat Senior year, criminal charges, potentially loss of scholarships, any threat they could think of was in that letter. My senior class discussed it despite the warnings, but in the end we decided not to do it.",

They started having armed nypd police in the building not one or two im talking like closer to 8 with a mobile precinct infront of the school. They were kicking kids out everyday and they wanted to take our fitteds and phones, not just for the day but permanently. \nThis led to the student body president calling for a protest and faculty agreeing to announce it over the PA system and say everyone who wants to attend can\u2026lol big mistake. School capacity was about 2000 kids I think? There was about 5000 kids enrolled in that school, 90% of the kids decided to go to the auditorium which obviously couldn\u2019t fit everyone, for the protest. It was so packed when the crowd jumped and chanted \u201chell no we won\u2019t go\u201d I think? If you was in the crowd your body moved with the crowd.\nKids started jumping on stage,destroying shit,pushing the faculty off the stage and they ran to hide, they started to throw all the debris around, a mic stand I think hit the lady who was from board of ed and shit went crazy after that\u2026everyone started to push their way out the building and into the very busy New York streets where atleast 1000 students started to run on the parked cars causing damage to many. The news channels were there, the reporters and camera crew had to run cause they started to grab the cameras and push them around. \n\nThat school as it was, no longer exists, I was the last graduating class. They turned into like a bunch of smaller schools I think today. \n\nNot funny at all. But caused major chaos not only in the school but the whole neighborhood. \n\nMe and my little group had our hookie party and got drunk the rest of the days. \n\nKids these days get a lot of criticism, but it\u2019ll never come from me. We were fucking stupid back then compared to these kids today.",

I used an entire large gym bag full. For a weekend that shit got churned up every time the pumps kicked in. Eventually the safety system kicked in and started topping off the pool since so much water was being removed by the bubbles. The school smelled like cheap bubble bath for weeks, and this was an outdoor pool in a west coast city, so all very open not a indoor high school. Pool was closed for months as they had to keep purging the system with anti foam agents. Wash and rinse. Whole schools PE schedule had to be rewritten to adjust for having the pool closed.

All the 4th graders were lined up on stage to rehearse our act for the annual musical performance, which was a show tune called \"white gloves\" or something. They gave us all white cotton gloves to wear, wave, and clap with. At the end of rehearsal, the music teacher stood in front of us with a box and said \"OK, throw your gloves into the box\".\n\nWe complied. Enthusiastically. Six dozen white gloves were flung in her general direction. The situation devolved into chaos in mere seconds, as we started picking up gloves and throwing them at each other like snowballs. The teacher was standing there with the ultimate look of \"I should not have said that\" on her face. \n\nIt took two other teachers five minutes to restore order, and no one got in trouble as our music teacher did in fact admit that she should not have given that instruction.",

For those that don't know, cows naturally have their front legs being about 15%-20% shorter then their hind legs. This means physically they can walk upstairs but not down. We knew it would be kind of a pain but nothing major.\n\nWhat we, shithead teenagers failed to realize, is there really was no practical way to get Penny back DOWN stairs. What ended up happening was they had to call in the county Animal Control Officer and she got euthanized WHILE THEY HAD CLASS IN SESSION. Naturally due to the sound of something having their subscription to life cancelled, all the little teenaged girls freaked.\n\nI'm sure admin had a lovely time with those parents calling in after they got an automated message of what went down that day",

The food services at the school were privately run and since it was a grammar school - all the food was quite expensive. \n\nPanini Dave would understand this and often add extra chicken, make custom food like adding loads of chicken to pasta etc. for a whole year and a half I got a free panini. I would eat 2 Paninis a day, and they were quite expensive. (I liked to eat more at school due to home stuff). Anyway, panini Dave decided to charge me for one only one day and that was that for a year. \n\nAnyway, as you can imagine to students loved him. They literally added him on socials, joked with him, he commented on one of my ig posts once. He had a family, and was an all around great guy.\n\nWell, one day he was caught taking an extra whole bag of southern fried chicken from the main kitchen to the upper school kitchen. He disappeared and was spotted washing up everyday in the main kitchen. There was a small window that overlooked the eating area and he was literally placed there to wash up during lunch hour. \n\nAnyway, people were mad. It started with discussion. People I know would mention it and start asking teachers about it. Eventually the head of sixth form commented that he was moved. \n\nWell someone started a petition. \u201cBring Panini Dave back to Cafe 6\u201d, it was well written and had a photo of him. A week later it was at 2000 signatures. People were joining in for the bants - other schools were signing it. \n\nPeople actually kinda boycott the cafe too. Like I just remember not buying from it for a while bc the new lady didn\u2019t make them as nice (and charged me over \u00a310 for 2). \n\nEventually the headmaster commented in assembly. Saying to drop it. I think Dave also wanted it to stop. He was protected by a union and didn\u2019t mind what the students were doing at first (probably found it funny), but at this point realised he did kinda steal chicken and wasn\u2019t bothered.\n\nSo it kinda faded out. It\u2019s been a couple years but I still remember panini Dave. I saw he posted on Facebook about how he unlocked an achievement on a mobile game called \u201cThug City\u201d.\n\nAnyway that\u2019s the story. Long live panini Dave.",

When a new high school whose colors were red and black opened up that was closer, the faculty decided to let the students vote on what the new school colors were going to be. \n\nOverwhelmingly, red and black was the forefront until it came out that it wouldn't be put into effect until the next year, so we 8th graders were stuck in the green and yellow till we left.\n\nEveryone decided the new school colors should be pink and white, which won the vote.\n\nThe staff struck down the results and went with red and black.",

The window did not break but I\u2019m sure the impact was thunderous. So much so that when we were waking back into the building dude was there waiting to tell on me.",

Someone mistakenly bumps the gas line shut off and fills the classroom with gas causing the school to be completely evacuated.  Junior and senior year I took auto shop off campus and I kid you not over the course of 2 years school was called off 10 or so times due to bomb threats. Mind you this was 16 ish years ago.",

Nobody knew if it was one person or a group of people, but I think after day five everyone got pretty tired of having to stand out in the football field while the fire department inspected the area. \n\nIt stopped after that week with no explanation and no word from the culprit.\n\nSecond best was definitely the senior prank performed by the class two years ahead of mine. They bought crickets from our local PetSmart and set them free on our school\u2019s main staircase. It took forever to get rid of them and I can remember sitting in class and hearing faint chirping coming from seemingly every direction.",

One day during one of the labs I wanted to flex that I was naturally good in computers and told the kid next to me this neat little trick of making the Mac say whatever I typed. Kid was blown away and then within a week you would constantly hear \u201csuck my d**k\u201d spoken  among other inappropriate profanity during class and that was when I realized that I released a plague upon the school. This was mid 90\u2019s so the admin tools I believe were very limited or our staff members were not very knowledgeable.\n\nThis continued for years even after I graduated.",

            "comment": "Oh my gosh finally, I have so much to add to a thread! Looking back obviously this stuff is horrific but it was chaotically very funny to us as kids. \n\nMy secondary/high school was notorious for being a bit of a rough school and it was chaos but in the best way when I was there. Various incidents that happened were:\n\n\u2022 We had wooden work benches in our science class. Someone poured ethanol over the benches and set fire to it. Everything went up in flames (even the window blinds) and we got evacuated. Not so funny at the time but looking back it was so chaotic it was funny. We all had to write a letter to the lad saying how disappointed we were in him. \ud83d\ude02\n\n\u2022 Speaking of science, it was chaos in general. People smashed test tubes. Poured lemon in plug sockets. Forks in blenders. Tried to burn each other with Bunsen burners. There was some sort of chamber where the teachers did experiments with various dangerous gasses\u2026 some lad ran over and lifted up the small door so the gasses escaped. Evacuated again. The same lad pulled all the spider plants in the room out their pots and chucked them across the tables. Soil everywhere. We were banned from experiments and had to use examples from textbooks for our exams/coursework. \n\n\u2022 Maths was another chaotic lesson. The same lad with the plants above brought a bottle of vodka into the lesson and proceeded to get pissed at the back of the classroom. Heavy maths books would be collected at the end of the lesson and then thrown around the room/at each other. Me and my friends spent a whole lesson making cat shaped confetti out of paper and threw it in the air during the book incident like some sort of macabre celebration. \n\n\u2022 Misc: Deputy head teacher got a lad in a head lock for kicking a football at the wall. Someone pulled a moonie to the playground from a second floor classroom to the whole of the playground and got expelled. A girl was chasing people around with a drawing pin and stabbing them on their bums. The canteen would sell \u201cbeanie nests\u201d (mash, beans and cheese in a container) people would buy these to throw them up the wall outside. Hundreds of mash splatters. In Art we made these giant paper sculptures - a lad took to throwing them out of the third floor window (the image of a giant paper dragon just gracefully smashing into the floor). In a GCSE exam everyone decided to go mad for no reason and with no prior planning - one person ran out and set the fire alarm off, everyone then descended into chaos jumping on tables, making their exam papers into paper airplanes etc. \n\nBonus chaos: we weren\u2019t allowed out at lunch, but some people would bring in wrenches to take some of the fences down and escape to the shop/chippy. They would hide behind cars whilst running away. I put an order in for some chips but my mate was late back. I was in History and she comes knocking on the door - the teacher answers and she\u2019s there like \u201cgot a bag of chips for YahDrem\u201d. We were then checked periodically for various tools to escape lmao. \n\nLike I said, diabolical behaviour and chaos. But god it was funny as a kid.\n\nEdit: now I\u2019m on a trip down memory lane and I\u2019m crying-laughing thinking about the fact a common chaotic occurrence was that each year, year seven students would have to make chocolate truffles as part of their food tech lesson. It became known the truffles were kept in this massive fridge in the back of the class to set. The kids in older years would break into said fridge and eat the truffles. Year 7 students/teacher would go back and find the truffles gone and be very upset. Very mean (quite funny \ud83d\ude02). \n\nThere was also a teacher who was chaotic and ended up disappearing for a few months. He came back and everyone was going mad in the playground chasing him upon his return. He was sticking his fingers up at the kids and in the chaos didn\u2019t look where he was going, walked into a really heavy double swinging door and got knocked out. \ud83e\udd72\n\nLAST ONE: in Art we had these giant tubs of paste. One lesson all of these tubs were thrown on the vinyl floor and it was like an ice rink. Everyone was falling over trying to walk around. Teacher got a broom to try and sweep it up and also fell over. Paste was then banned.",

It's most likely the best sci-fi this decade. S1 has a very detective/noir feel to it, but later in S2 and onwards, it gets more focused on space sci-fi.",

Hopes were that privatizing in \u201898 would get more people using tap water instead of groundwater. Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t do shit to improve things so the government took back control of piping in 2017. Since taking over though, the government has yet to develop any long term policies to improve the network so groundwater wells continues to be used by about 65% of the population.\n\nFor anyone curious, too much groundwater extraction causes \u201cland subsidence.\u201d The groundwater is removed and the land collapses on itself to fill in that leftover empty space, reducing the altitude surface land sits.\n\nJakarta is now recorded to be sinking nearly 7\u201d a year... By 2025 (FIVE YEARS), one-third of the city will be uninhabitable and several million displaced...\n\nBlows my mind the government would prefer to ditch Jakarta and spend $30 billion to move the capital 100 miles instead of fixing the piping issues present.\n\nEdit: Adding sources below for you\n\nEdit 2: Stupid paywall on first link, screen grabbed and linked to imgur\n\n- [Infrastructure specialist Hongjoo Hahm on what\u2019s directly causing sinking of city](https://m.imgur.com/a/tQSqlDO)\n\n- [Jakarta has sank more than 4 meters already](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/why-parts-of-jakarta-have-dropped-by-four-meters/) \n\n- [From private water pipes to government regaining control.

Especially if the sinking will be so disastrous that 1/3 of the city will be lost in 5 years.\n\nI wonder if they'll get away with it, or that it will cause major backlash since it is essentially abandoning a sinking city.",

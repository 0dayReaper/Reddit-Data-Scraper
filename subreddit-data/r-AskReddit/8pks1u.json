I was able to find someone in network for him, who he didn't feel like was a good fit, but due to insurance issues, couldn't do anything about it and eventually stopped going when he no longer felt in imminent danger. For myself, I couldn't find an in network provider accepting new patients at all, so my primary care doctor prescribed me medication and had me get a therapist unaffiliated with her clinic. Then 6 months later I get a call from one of the providers I previously reached out to saying I got off their waiting list. I am very happy with the psych NP and therapist I'm working with, but they are located an hour away from the major city where I live. As horrible as my experience finding providers has been, I'm also fortunate enough to have insurance, so I can't imagine how much more challenging fining a provider is for the uninsured who can't afford it.

I personally understand that it's ment with good intent, but on someone who is suicidal and not quite in their right mind it often has the opposite effect of where it feels like you're being shoved into a corner or dumped as someone elses problem. More often than not someone suicidal wants to talk to a normal person, someone who will care or listen to them, of course I am not telling strangers that you have to be that person - I know it shouldn't be anyone elses responsibility, all I am trying to say is that if you really want to help someone or make them feel better, linking them to something else is not a great way to go about it, it's much better worked into a conversation as a suggestion on the side.\n\nAgain, I don't want to come off as a dick here - I think it's great that so many people care enough to want to encourage others to seek help, but try to keep this in mind. That feeling of being pushed away or getting a predictable and generic answer often makes you feel more isolated and more depressed.",

I answered honestly since I just needed to talk to someone. Next thing I know I had no less than 6 officers at my door. I was in full blown panic attack mode by then, and one officer told the rest he had it under control with his partner and the others left. They talked with me for awhile, then handed me my shoes and said you can come willingly or we can take you. I chose to go willingly and was transported to the hospital. They were understaffed, gave me an iv with Ativan and sent me home. I still never got to talk to anyone, and still feel the same. All it did was make me not want to ever call again. ",

All I can recommend is FlashVPN for Android, and maybe Betternet cracked from onhax.me (search the site) for windows.

It was *scary* to think that I was potentially killing myself whereas a death I couldn't control or had less control over would just...happen. Then there's everyone and everything else to consider. I also have caught myself wishing many times that the whole world would end so that I could stop existing but then neither myself nor my loved ones would have to deal with the pain or miss out on a good life. \n\nI found those things really hard to articulate at 19.

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire\u2019s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It\u2019s not desiring the fall; it\u2019s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 and \u2018Hang on!\u2019, can understand the jump. Not really. You\u2019d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.\"\n\n- David Foster Wallace\n\nDepression is a scary thing.

I constantly feel guilty for all the times my friends have seen me cry, or have seen the aftermath of my self-harm, or have had to \"deal with\" the fact that I sleep ALL THE TIME and don't smile and spend entire days curled up in a ball bingeing Netflix in an attempt to find something louder than the shit going on in my head. I don't really know if this will make any sense but, like, good friends are there to help you and won't see you as a burden or a problem. Like, anybody remember that song. \"Lean on Me\"? The friends/family you have are there for you to lean on. We always feel like we have to hide how fucked up we feel. I always think stuff like, \"oh if so-and-so finds my body that'll be awful for them. I'd feel terrible for putting them through that.\" But on the other hand, it would be so much worse for them to spend the rest of their life feeling like they should've done something or that they could have stopped me. \n\nI had someone tell me the other day basically that relationships have to be a two-way street: YOU have to be there for THEM, but you also have to let THEM be there for YOU. I'm sorry if this is too rambly to make sense. Just, don't let the fear of having others know what's going on with you keep you from telling them that you need help.",

For obvious reasons (at least, for anyone who has had to listen to me bitch about how much I hate winter), it really resonated with me...\n\n*****\nWhen you have depression it\u2019s like it snows every day.\n\nSome days it\u2019s only a couple of inches. It\u2019s a pain in the ass, but you still make it to work, the grocery store. Sure, maybe you skip the gym or your friend\u2019s birthday party, but it IS still snowing and who knows how bad it might get tonight. Probably better to just head home.  Your friend notices, but probably just thinks you are flaky now, or kind of an asshole.\n\nSome days it snows a foot. You spend an hour shoveling out your driveway and are late to work. Your back and hands hurt from shoveling. You leave early because it\u2019s really coming down out there. Your boss notices.\n\nSome days it snows four feet. You shovel all morning but your street never gets plowed. You are not making it to work, or anywhere else for that matter. You are so sore and tired you just get back in bed. By the time you wake up, all your shoveling has filled back in with snow. Looks like your phone rang; people are wondering where you are. You don\u2019t feel like calling them back, too tired from all the shoveling. Plus they don\u2019t get this much snow at their house so they don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re still stuck at home. They just think you\u2019re lazy or weak, although they rarely come out and say it.\n\nSome weeks it\u2019s a full-blown blizzard. When you open your door, it\u2019s to a wall of snow. The power flickers, then goes out. It\u2019s too cold to sit in the living room anymore, so you get back into bed with all your clothes on. The stove and microwave won\u2019t work so you eat a cold Pop Tart and call that dinner. You haven\u2019t taken a shower in three days, but how could you at this point? You\u2019re too cold to do anything except sleep.\n\nSometimes people get snowed in for the winter. The cold seeps in. No communication in or out. The food runs out. What can you even do, tunnel out of a forty foot snow bank with your hands? How far away is help? Can you even get there in a blizzard? If you do, can they even help you at this point? Maybe it\u2019s death to stay here, but it\u2019s death to go out there too.\n\nThe thing is, when it snows all the time, you get worn all the way down. You get tired of being cold. You get tired of hurting all the time from shoveling, but if you don\u2019t shovel on the light days, it builds up to something unmanageable on the heavy days. You resent the hell out of the snow, but it doesn\u2019t care, it\u2019s just a blind chemistry, an act of nature. It carries on regardless, unconcerned and unaware if it buries you or the whole world.\n\nAlso, the snow builds up in other areas, places you can\u2019t shovel, sometimes places you can\u2019t even see. Maybe it\u2019s on the roof. Maybe it\u2019s on the mountain behind the house. Sometimes, there\u2019s an avalanche that blows the house right off its foundation and takes you with it. A veritable Act of God, nothing can be done. The neighbors say it\u2019s a shame and they can\u2019t understand it; he was doing so well with his shoveling.\n\n-\n\nI don\u2019t know how it went down for Anthony Bourdain or Kate Spade. It seems like they got hit by the avalanche, but it could\u2019ve been the long, slow winter. Maybe they were keeping up with their shoveling. Maybe they weren\u2019t. Sometimes, shoveling isn\u2019t enough anyway. It\u2019s hard to tell from the outside, but it\u2019s important to understand what it\u2019s like from the inside.\n\nI firmly believe that understanding and compassion have to be the base of effective action. It\u2019s important to understand what depression is, how it feels, what it\u2019s like to live with it, so you can help people both on an individual basis and a policy basis. I\u2019m not putting heavy shit out here to make your Friday morning suck. I know it feels gross to read it, and realistically it can be unpleasant to be around it, that\u2019s why people pull away.\n\nI don\u2019t have a message for people with depression like \u201ckeep shoveling.\" It\u2019s asinine.  Of course you\u2019re going to keep shoveling the best you can, until you physically can\u2019t, because who wants to freeze to death inside their own house? We know what the stakes are. My message is to everyone else. Grab a fucking shovel and help your neighbor. Slap a mini snow plow on the front of your truck and plow your neighborhood. Petition the city council to buy more salt trucks, so to speak.  \n\nDepression is blind chemistry and physics, like snow. And like the weather, it is a mindless process, powerful and unpredictable with great potential for harm. But like climate change, that doesn\u2019t mean we are helpless. If we want to stop losing so many people to this disease, it will require action at every level.\n\nEdit: Feel free to share this with anyone or anywhere you think it might help. We aren't alone. Even when there's warm bodies around when we are cold we still shiver. Offer a blanket.\n\nEdit 2: I just want to say thank you and you're welcome to everyone who is commenting and can relate. You're not alone. Not just me, but many of us truly understand how you feel. But I won't tell you what to do. We who suffer have been told time and again what to do. But if someone offers you a blanket sometimes the warmth can help.  \n\nEdit 3: I'm trying to comment on everyone that is posting and thanking me for sharing. I think it's important that everyone is acknowledged that took the time to share their thoughts. Everyone matters. \n\n***Thank you to whomever (whoever?) gave me my first gold.

My depression and anxiety make it hard for me to function like a normal person. When it's really bad, I start falling behind in school, my house is a mess, I'm late for work, etc. My family likes to joke that I'm lazy, which I might be, but some days I just don't have the willpower or energy to function and it's hard to explain that to people. My anxiety often results in insomnia, and the lack of sleep makes my depression worse, and it becomes a vicious cycle. Luckily I'm on decent meds now which help, but I'm still trying to be better. Thank you for putting this into words.",

            "comment": "I bought a dog. \n\nI have a very busy life, so people ask me if I regret having her, since dogs are all high maintenance. I need to walk her a few times a day, feed her, keep her entertained, clean up after her, remove dog hair from everything including myself with an unending supply of lint rollers. \n\nI don't regret it. I got her for one purpose that I won't tell them. Because I'm lonely. Because when I'm at my loneliest, I don't have anyone to turn to, no-one to go see, to talk to, despite my best efforts. I have her because I know if I died, something would miss me, so I can't leave her. \n\nI left her at the dog boarding for an extra day after getting back from a work trip, earlier this week. I found myself calling for her, and she wouldn't come. For the first time in years, I just cried. I missed her. I wanted to sit on the couch and just pet her like she always loves. Fortunately, I could just grab her the next day. But it reminded me how important she is to my mental health. \n\nI recently turned down a job that would have required me to move to a place where I would have even less familial and friend support. I would have been traveling most of the year, so I would have to give up my dog. I'm glad I did. I had one friend tell me to \"absolutely not take the job\"; he said if I took it, he gave me 6 months before I jumped off a bridge. I can't say he would be wrong. \n\nI used work to redirect my loneliness over the past several years, which ended up making it worse as it alienated me from those that I was close to. And then the company abandoned me; hired someone above me that openly tells people inside and outside of the company that he's trying to fire me. I have the CEO and President behind me, so he can't touch me; they know what I did for the company, my sacrifice, my skill, my dedication and loyalty. I now have much less responsibilities, so I can relax. \n\nNow, I'm here, with my dog, trying to decompress from my job, make more friends, actually date girls for the first time in many years of unsuccessfully trying. Things are starting to look better. \n\nHere's to better days. ",

The few months after his passing and before I got my current dog were some of the hardest time of my life.  I couldn't eat, couldn't get out of bed, couldn't concentrate on anything and lost like 20lb in a month.  I would sit on the sofa for hours and just stare into space or look at pictures/video of him and crying non-stop. It didn't get better with time and my family/friends/coworkers all got super worried and basically demanded that I get another dog asap.

He would be turning ten this July 2nd. My \"only show I can watch\" was the awful dating show \"Next\" on Mtv. The night he died my husband (boyfriend at the time) and I sat in a hotel room (because we couldn't possibly go home and face his stuff) and played a cooperative board game all night long. We took breaks to cry and scream, and then kept playing. That stupid game kept me alive, I'm sure of it. I also had to always have a plan for tomorrow. Even if it was just what I was going to have for breakfast. There were days that I would cry so hard I thought the crying alone would kill me. I had to force myself to stop, certain I was about to literally die of a broken heart. \n\nI'm so so sorry for your loss. Four months is still so fresh. I'm nearly a decade out, and some days I still can't believe I'm a member of this shitty club. Understand that the grief may come in waves. Close together and fierce at first, and then slowing down, giving some time and space before the next one pummels you. Make sure your support people are still around in case you need to call out \"potato\" again, six months from now. I can be one of those support people. There is nothing that makes it easier, but time and support can help it be more manageable. Also, talking about him can help. I hated that once he was gone people wanted to pretend he never existed. Fuck that. Your son was here, and he was amazing. Talk about him. Much love to you and your Miles. &lt;3",

I looked up to him and wanted to be like him. He\u2019d take the fall for me when I did something that would cause my dad to punish me. I remember that morning vividly. I got back from school the previous day and went to go hang out with him in his room but his door was locked. I kept coming back but he wouldn\u2019t answer the door. My parents weren\u2019t worried because my brother usually kept to himself like that. When it was time for bed I told my dad to see if he could get the door open and he told me not to bother my brother again. After my brother didn\u2019t come down for breakfast my father broke his door and we found him hanging from the ceiling. I wish I didn\u2019t see that. I screamed the entire time and wouldn\u2019t left go of his hand. It felt cold and my mother had to peel me away. He left a suicide note and a hand written will. He left me his favourite book. I miss you Jeff. \n\nEdit: Thank you so much everyone for the love. \n\nEdit 2: My dad kept repeating \u201cwhy Jeffery? Why? and tried to get him down from the fan. I was screaming PLEASE JEFF! and pulling his hand and when my mom couldn\u2019t separate our hands she pulled me away. She was crying so hard. I remember kicking my legs in the air and screaming \u201cyou should have opened his door for me\u201d\n\nEdit 3: The book is Animal farm by George Orwell. I always carry it with me now. Whenever he\u2019d read it to me I\u2019d make fun of how the big words sounded funny and we\u2019d laugh. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t much in his will. He left me the book and his game boy. He left my mom his wrist watch. My dad didn\u2019t get anything in the will. \n\nEdit 4: Wow I woke up to a ton of supportive messages and so much love. Thank you for all your kind words. I\u2019ve never spoken about the details before and I pray this helps someone who is struggling. To all the Jeff\u2019s, I know it\u2019s hard but please be strong. You don\u2019t want to have your family calling your name and you not answering. It\u2019s the most painful thing ever. For years I had nightmares of trying to save him but each time I\u2019d get there too late. \n\nIn his note he said he was really sorry and didn\u2019t mean to hurt any of us but he just couldn\u2019t bear the pain anymore. He said he hoped it would make my dad stop being disappointed in him and called me his best bud in the world. He told my mom he loved her and hoped she\u2019d find the courage he didn\u2019t have. \n\nThanks to all the gold x 4!",

Then when I went to check in at the clinic I had sent him to - they were just about to send him back. So there he is, getting one last set of vitals and he stiffens up, clutches his chest and starts gushing foamy blood from his mouth. \n\nIt couldn't have gone better, because we had an AED, and *immediately* started CPR.

One of my biggest fears for years and years has been that I would also develop schizophrenia, because as I'm sure you also know there is a genetic predisposition for it. I agree. My mom's life has been and continues to be hell, a nightmare. She is miserable and has made so many of her loved ones miserable as well. I don't know if she'll ever be anywhere close to even functional. I'm in the process of coming to terms with the fact that even if she gets there, she will never, ever be the person she used to be. The woman who was my mom is dead.\n\nI don't think suicide is the better option than the gamble. You're not *guaranteed* to develop schizophrenia, a moderate risk is just that. In fact, the fact that it's a concern means you and your family/chosen family are more likely to be aware of concerning signs before too much damage can be done. The last time I read up it seemed like it's theorized that a schizophrenic break can be triggered by unmanaged emotions after a traumatic event. If you know you have to keep on top of your mental health and enlist your loved ones to help you do that, you'll be more resilient.\n\nAlso, schizophrenia usually has an onset in your late teens to early thirties. It's a long-ass time to have to worry about and be vigilant. But it's not forever.\n\nIf you don't commit suicide today and your life descends into a truly unliveable hell of unmanageable psychosis tomorrow, you can always change your mind. But if you commit suicide today on the chance that you might be overtaken by illness tomorrow, changing your mind isn't an option. So I'd say every day, you should consider giving it one more day.",

There were many times I imagined killing myself and one night I was set on doing it. Came home drunk and sad and started cutting myself, which was one of my methods for dealing with my emotions. I sat in my bed crying, trying to find the courage to cut deeper and end it. Then my dog Snoopy hopped up on the bed and put his head on my lap. Thanks to him I realized that I just couldn't do that to him or to my parents and friends. He saved my life that night. The next day I decided to open up to my parents and ask them to help me find some help, which was a huge step forward.

            "comment": "I don't talk about suicide much, because it is a very painful subject for me... perhaps, in part, because the shadow of it stalks me sometimes, waiting to catch me when I'm down.\n\nBut 11 years ago, I was desperate enough to believe that everyone who knew me would be better off without me. I believed that the scales weighed heavily against me - that I caused more harm than good - and that if I simply didn't exist, it would make things better for everyone.\n\nSo I started counting my pills. I'd been seeking treatment for depression for five months, but nothing was working. The meds made me worse, or they made me so apathetic that I found no joy in life, or they gave me such bad side effects that I could barely stay lucid. I thought there was no way out. So I was counting my pills, trying to figure out how many would cause an overdose so I could take them, lie down in bed, and die.\n\nI'd arranged them all nicely, counted out every single one. I'd positioned my glass of water next to them all, and I stood staring at the scene, feeling *so* overwhelmed because the intensity and duration of my suffering had been so drawn out, and it just wasn't getting better. It had been years. *Years*. A slow decline until a breakdown, and then I was in so deep I couldn't see a way out.\n\nThen the phone rang. It was a friend of mine, a Catholic priest, who said he felt moved to call me and see how I was doing in case things were bad. I lied to him; I told him that I was fine, that I was receiving treatment and that I was hopeful that things would start looking up. But I didn't think I had any fight left in me. He told me that he believed I did, and that he hoped I could hang on awhile longer.\n\nI hung up the phone and burst into tears - ugly, inconsolable crying, snot dripping out my nose, curled up in a ball. But my friend had planted a seed of hope. *Someone* believed in me, even if I couldn't. And I guess I felt that I owed it to him - and to my family - to try.\n\nI managed to get an appointment at the emergency psychiatry clinic awhile later, and there I met the psychiatrist who prescribed the drug that saved my life. I got into a daily outpatient program at the hospital. I met other people who were like me, and I found myself believing in them - believing that they could fight, that they could get better, even though I didn't believe I could. Somehow, they said they believed in me, too. And so for a second time, I saw that other people believed in me, even if I didn't. And I felt again that I should try.\n\nSo I tried. I got into weekly therapy with a psychiatrist, and I was in her care for seven years. She adjusted my meds as needed and we began the long, arduous process of untangling the mess that was my mind. She never gave up on me. (I'm in a country where she doesn't make money off me. She gets a flat salary.) \n\nNow, it's 11 years later, and things *have* gotten better. I am better now than I ever have been. It took awhile after my rock bottom moment to find that spark of hope within myself, but I did find it, and that is what kept me going. It made me look for anything I could to keep me hanging on, and even now, it's the small things in life that keep me here. When the moon shines through my window at night and pools on my pillow. When the white blossoms on that weird bush in the backyard finally bloom for one week every year, and I can smell them on the wind. When my dog wakes up in the morning and comes to get me because he is happy I am awake. When the sun shines just right, or the wind sends petals filtering down through the trees, or the world is silent and glittery after a fresh snowfall.\n\nI find those moments, and I \"keep\" them. I commit them to memory so that when things get bad again, I can remember what I love about this life, and remind myself to keep hanging on. \n\nI still get low.Two years ago, I had been fired from my job and was certain I would never become a fully functional adult and I would always have to fight tooth and nail just to exist in society. I stood on a subway platform and listened to the rattle of the trains and tried to convince myself not to jump. The tracks were hypnotising, almost. I looked up and found myself staring at a poster for suicide prevention, and the irony was not lost on me. It broke the trance. I stepped back from the yellow line and went home. I stayed.\n\nLast month, I got slapped in the face with a bout of severe depression out of nowhere, and then my dog passed away, which made it worse. (Dogs immensely improve my mental health.) But I stayed.\n\nYou can stay, too. \n\nTake it day by day. For those of us with severe mental health issues, that's all we can do - take it day by day, see how we feel, see if there are any little joys we can find and savour them. You have to cultivate the ability to find them, and it might not be easy at first. (I'm a stubborn ass and was originally so intent on believing that there was nothing good in the world that it took me a couple years to learn how to look closer.) But eventually, you'll have a breakthrough. Maybe you'll see a toddler get pegged by a ball and you'll fall over laughing. Maybe you'll hear the cicadas buzz in the heat of August and remember how awesome summers felt as a kid. Maybe you'll find an indie game on Steam that has a really compelling story and you'll find that you can't WAIT to get back to it and find out what happens next. You never know.\n\nBut you can stay. Just take it day by day. And you can see what happens.\n\n\n",

I've traveled much, tried to change my mood with drugs, sought intense relationships. In the end, I was left with me - alone.  I had to be okay with that being enough, even when I felt like I was broken open to the bone\n\nI think we collectively have been sold a false bill of goods. To strive for happiness.  What does that even mean? A new car, a great career, family?  I'm upper middle class now yet, even when I was a gas station attendant, I was able to make a difference for people- I remember the guy who dropped his wallet with $900 and I only made $450 a month. When I handed him back his wallet full of cash he looked like he believed in miracles.\n\nPerhaps the things to strive for in life are being of service? Practicing kindness? Connecting with others? Seeking balance?\n\nI no longer try to be happy. Happiness is a mood.  Mood is like ocean waves that can be unpredictable, uplifting at one moment and crushing at the next. I no longer seek happiness from others or try and change my mood with alcohol or external forces. The daily grind of doing right (years), for me, alone and over time, has created a life that I can be content with.\n\nWhat works for me is to serve others, strive for balance, and live in the now. Despite my history or maybe because of it, I am content. That doesn't change my past or my history of abuse or my history of questionable choices.  But here in the now, still alone, I feel like it is enough.\n\nI have hope. For all of us.\n\n\n\nEdit:  thank you for the gold kind stranger.  I'm humbled and grateful my life lessons resonated.

The police, my family, everyone in my life seemed to take their side. The judge ruled that I couldn't stay at my house during the investigation because my little sisters where there and they seemed me a danger to them. I ended up being put up in a shitty hotel for a month while my attorney fought to have any kind of medical exam done to try to prove my innocence. Being shunned by everyone I've cared for got to be too much and I decided I'd had enough. I managed to get ahold of a bunch of pain pills and a fifth of Jack and took them all and went to bed. I woke up the next morning in a pool of vomit. In the end though, I'm glad I survived my attempt, things got better. My accuser couldn't keep their story straight and ended up confessing to making it up in court. My life has started to stabilize and I met the woman of my dreams who has helped me work through my issues. I still deal with depression but I've got a pretty good treatment regimen right now. Sorry if this seems rambling, this is the first time I've ever mentioned this in any kind of public setting. ",

I\u2019m not comfortable saying how I did it, but when I regained consciousness I called a friend who helped me. I\u2019m so glad that I wasn\u2019t successful. When I was a young child, my mom and I walked in on my brother unconscious after a hanging and it\u2019s an image that is seared into my brain.

The thought of her having to go through that again, ensures that I will never attempt it anymore. Instead of wishing to die in my sleep, I\u2019m so thankful for every day that I wake up. Because every day, is a fresh start.\n\nAnd to the kind stranger on here who has talked to me and helped me, if you ever read this, thank you so much. You have helped more than you\u2019ll ever know.

But this is not uniformly true. Many many people who are suicidal are genuinely not \"mentally ill.\" \n\nSpeaking of myself a long time ago now and others I have known - there are people out there whose suicidal ideation is a \"logical\" analytic response to essentially impossible life pressures and situations and - right or wrong - it can feel very hurtful, even offensive, and unhelpful to tell them their thinking is clouded. \n\nI and others I have known used the same basically functional working (but very very stressed) analytic mind to **choose* not to commit suicide.  \n\nAs I moved through that place and eventually out of it, I had to hold onto the \"option\" in my mind and make the choice -- albeit increasingly more easily -- many times before it was gone. \n\nAll that and this too - please don't turn people into messages or PSAs. Suicide is absolutely horrible - I have been affected by its aftermath more times than I care to share, very directly and less intimately as well. It is probably almost never the right thing to do (save terminal illness, etc) but its important to honor lives as more than their ending. ",

I started working on my letters to family. My husband had some friends over already, everyone was drinking and hanging out. \n\nI left the notebook unattended and my 17 year old stepson saw it, and asked to talk - for the first time in my 8 years of being his stepmom. Him, his girlfriend, and my other stepson had me sit and talk for hours. They told me all the things in my head weren't real.

I knew I had deep issues but didn\u2019t want to deal with them. I always masked them and found ways to distract myself.\n\nI went to my family doctor and got referred to a psychiatrist and I\u2019ve been seeing a few for the last couple months.\n\nI feel very proud to say that this week has been my first week in years that I can say I\u2019ve been genuinely happy and proud of myself.\n\nIt gets better. It genuinely does. Even when you\u2019re in the deepest hole. But you can\u2019t do it alone. You can\u2019t just cover over your issues. You need to destroy them.\n\nIn Canada, you can get referred to therapists for free by your family doctor. It takes a long time, but the wait is worth it. In the meantime, tell your friends. If they\u2019re your true friends, they\u2019ll understand. And, if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll find out that they\u2019re going through the same thing.\n\nEdit: wow, didn\u2019t expect such a huge response. I didn\u2019t even expect anybody to see this. Thank you everybody for the kind words! Unfortunately, not everything works for everybody. I also have no idea how things work in the US. If somebody has gotten help in the States, please respond to a few comments below!\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the Gold! Also, it appears that some places in Canada you do not get free therapists. Hopefully it\u2019ll be easier for everybody one day \ud83d\ude0c",

            "comment": "In 2015 I was fresh off a wonderful honeymoon with my amazing wife when I hit a little low. I'm manic depressive and am used to the ups and downs, but this low didn't go away. I thought I was stronger than my depression but it just kept going. After about 6 months my spouse was just barely able to hang in there and was spending a lot of time at her mother's in another town because I was just such a fucking asshole and was losing myself. Christmas night that year, wife was at her family's celebration, I sat in our guest bedroom alone and had my 9mm in my hand. I struggled and was crying and angry and a fucking nightmare was unfolding in my head. I couldn't do it though. I let my dog in and be jumped on me and was licking me and wagging his tail, so I hung out with him for a while and put the gun away. I promised my wife I would try to make the changes necessary to recover and fast forward to today, we're halfway through her pregnancy with our first! It's a boy! I'm very physically active and I have things to work towards, and now a son coming that deserves a great set of parents. My wife is incredible and she stuck with me through times where I would have left myself... She did what she could when she could, considering how much I was pushing everyone away during that time. I can never repay her for being loyal to me when I don't think I deserved loyalty, I just hope I can give her and my son the best husband and dad possible for the rest of our lives. \n\nEdit: at the time, I was planning to make everyone hate me so no one would miss me when I finally killed myself. It was a dark pattern that made me lose who I was. I am a different person today and I have learned to recognize the signs and not ignore my \"small lows\". I never miss a chance to tell my wife how wonderful she is. I also added the physically active part because getting back into shape and being physically tired is incredibly therapeutic for me, personally. ",

            "comment": "I got a dog here. If I didn't come home one day, he'd never stop sitting by the door waiting for me. He'd never stop missing my smell and my voice. He'd never stop wishing for one more walk, one more game of chasing the laser with me, one more high-five for a treat. He'd never stop jumping to peek out the window when he heard somebody coming up the sidewalk, and letting his heart be filled with a moment's joyful hope. No matter how many times that hope was dashed, he'd never let go of it. He's kind of a doofus that way.\n\nAnybody else in my life might eventually get over it. You can explain to them what happened and they'd at least be able to understand if not accept it. But my little brown dog would sit forever wondering why I didn't come home. And he's had a hard enough life so far. I was his only friend when he had nobody, and he was mine.\n\nNo matter what I'm going through in life, putting him through that sort of suffering is not something my soul would ever let me do. Otherwise, I probably would have done it already. \n\nLife is random. There's no fate. There's no karma. \"The Secret\" doesn't actually work, except for making the people who wrote those books rich. There's no magic Santa Claus in the sky making sure all the good people are blessed and the bad people are punished. Maybe God exists, but he sure doesn't interfere. I've been praying for decades for some sort of help, or at least guidance so I can help myself. No response. No answers either. For example, why did a loving God let such an abusive monster come into my mom's life when I was a kid, turning me into an emotional cripple who can't deal with any sort of stress without crumbling? Why does child abuse happen every single day in this world? No response.\n\nSo a sane person can only conclude that it's all just random. \n\nThat can be scary. But it can also be liberating. It means that the sheer law of averages will save your ass at some point. It can't all be bad forever. That breaks the laws of the universe. At some point something randomly good will happen. The scales will eventually balance. There's no intelligence behind it. It's just chaos that's part good and part bad. Accept it. Fighting it won't change anything.\n\nOne thing's for sure, though. Those who are prepared for the random things that come their way will have a better time dealing with them. Sit exactly on the middle line between optimism and pessimism. Prepare for emergencies so that they don't destroy you, and enjoy the good things to the fullest when they do come. But overall, just wait and watch, knowing and accepting that nothing can be good forever, but neither can anything be bad forever. ",

If you had a massive issue that you couldn't even pinpoint what it was, how would you go about telling someone about it, and asking for help? Or even when you do tell them you are having issues, and they shrug it off because they aren't in your place and they can't understand. What do you do? Nothing, you're alone.\n\nI was depressed for a little over a year, and that year felt like an eternity. I felt like a prisoner in my own mind. Depression feels like.. being stuck in a dark, cramped, windowless room. You can't see anything, you can't move, you're suffocating. You're panicking. There are people on the outside telling you that they will figure out a way to get you out. That they are with you. But in truth they have no idea what to do and you're not even sure if they are trying, or if they even care.  \n\nPeople who care will actually do something about it. They will drag you out of bed, kicking and screaming to get you to a hospital, or a mental institute, or a appointment with a therapist, or psychologist. And the only reason I ever got better was because someone physically forced me to leave my house and see a doctor. And even after being denied and confused about where to find help, he spent the entire day with me, driving around town to different hospital locations to find me a psychologist. Because that's what good friends fucking do. So stop telling people that you are there just to talk, and instead actually take action to help them. People who have depression are so enclosed within their room that they can't reach out to people, and that is why people are dying from suicide. \n\nMy two friends who both died at such an early age to depression, they were two of the most beautiful, kind, popular, and loving people I have ever met, and I always feels so FUCKING heart broken that I didn't know what to do until it was too late.

(I didn't understand at the time). It took me a long time to realise that - actually, its not normal for a parent to drink themselves into oblivion and take a handful of drugs or slit their wrists! He was later diagnosed with bipolar. \n\nFast forward when I was a teenager my parents had split up, dad was steeply declining in his mental health, still drinking heavily. Still attempting/threatening suicide almost weekly.\nHe would attempt to run into walls with knives against his stomach until I'd grab him, constantly overdose. Cut himself.\n\nMy mum then remarried. I always felt a responsibility to keep my dad happy and safe so left my mums wedding early to meet my dad to make sure he was holding up OK. Of course we met in the pub, still in my bridesmaid dress, my dad walked over to me very wobbly - I assumed he was drunk. He flopped his arm around me and told me he was going to get another drink as he walked away my dress was completely covered in blood  across my waist. He had slit his wrist in a zig zag from inner elbow to his hand.\nI told the barman what had happened, walked out the door, burst into tears and ran 2 miles home.\nAt this stage I had completely had enough, I remember vividly thinking \"I just wish he would get it over and done with so I don't have to deal with it!\"\n But still I went up every day to make sure he was eating, taking his meds and generally keeping him company. \nAt 15 I hadn't been up in around a week, my best friend and I had planned a girls night around our mutual friends house and popped in to see my dad on the way over. \nAs soon as I walked into the communal corridor I smelt it. I knew. \nFound him led on his living room floor, flat on his back with his eyes open. Flies crawling on his arms. \nCalled for an ambulance (silly - I know, I was 15 and thought they could save him) \nI don't think anyone realises the physical pain of being told \"I'm sorry he's been gone for some time, there's nothing we can do) until they go through it, it feels like a knife to the chest. \nThe aftermath of so many 'I didn't think he would ever actually do it's' was astounding. \n\nPlease, if ever somebody tells you somebody self harms for attention, take them damn seriously.

But I can now see a light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nTo everyone that suffers from mental illness: I see you, I\u2019m here for you, and you are not alone. The world may seem empty. Everything may lose its luster. Just know that there are those who genuinely care for &amp; support you. Even if you can\u2019t always see or feel it.",

            "comment": "My brother killed himself in 2010. No one saw it coming. This is someone who had a very bright future ahead of him. He was all set to take over the family business. He was a quarter back in high school and also rode dirt bikes, and he was really good at both. He loved to fish and hunt, he was passionate about a lot of things in life, especially his 2 year old daughter. He had a beautiful and infectious smile. Anyway, he caught his girlfriend cheating on him one night, and apparently she was sending him pictures of her with the guy. He was heartbroken. They had a baby together, and lived together. I remember him telling me all he wanted was his family back. She moved out and shortly after he saw her at a bar with her new boyfriend, the bar where both my step sister and step brother worked and one that she knew my brother frequented. Why she chose to go to that bar with him is beyond me. My brother got shitfaced and showed up at her new apartment. He pointed the gun at her new boyfriend and when his ex got on the phone with the police, he turned it on himself. I remember vividly going over there two day after to pick up my niece, and the blood stain was still there in the breezeway. \n\nMy dad got a knock on his door at 3am, it was two state troopers telling him his only son was gone. I remember the phone call, my sister telling me he shot himself, and it didn\u2019t even fully register. All I could do was mutter \u201cis he alive?\u201d. I remember sitting around my kitchen table with my family, all of us just quietly crying. My dad almost sold his boat because they would fish together, and it was too painful to take it out anymore. I\u2019m happy to say that 8 years later my dad just went to Lake Erie, by himself, and he said he felt like my brother was on the lake with him. It almost gets harder as time goes on because you start to remember less and less about them, and the memories are all you have. My niece is the spitting image of him, having her around is like having a piece of him with us, she\u2019s very special to us! \n\nWhat his suicide did to me personally is a whole different story. He was my best friend, and after he died I went down a very dark path. I self medicated and became addicted. At one point the only thing that was keeping me from hanging myself from a pipe in my basement was that I couldn\u2019t imagine putting my dad through the pain of losing another child. The following 5 years after his death I put my family through hell all over again, i was still alive but actively trying to kill myself with drugs. I have been sober for 4 years, have a beautiful son now, and I am set to graduate college this December. Life is pretty good! We miss him every day and the pain of losing him will never go away, but where there is life, there is hope. There is never someone who is too far gone or that can\u2019t turn things around, I am proof. The only reason I\u2019m still here is because I finally surrendered, and got the help I needed. I wish my brother had done the same. None of us had any idea what he was going through mentally. \n\nIf you suspect someone is struggling reach out to them! I\u2019m sorry to everyone who lost someone to suicide, I know your pain, and to those fighting the good fight, keep pushing \ud83d\udc4a ",

            "comment": "Please don't use the saying \"It's a permanent solution to a temerapy problem.\n\nThis might be true for someone who suffers from situational depression. The depression that goes away.\n\nFor someone with chronic depression it never truly goes away. It is not a temporary problem. It can be managed. You can be better. You can learn to live almost normally. \n\nBut when a person has been suffering for years, barely living, barely able to get out of bed most morning, it's not a temporary problem.\n\nWhen I was in my worst depressed state and I heard that saying for the first time, what I heard was: \"It's a permanent solution to a permanent problem\" And you know what? That was comforting. It was encouraging in the wrong way. I wanted to just cease to exist. Not have to worry about waking up the next morning. \n\nWhat got me through was knowing that I would destroy my children's lives. I knew they would blame themselves. Even if I thought they were better off without me there and that I was damaging them. If I took my life it would be much worse for them.\n\nI started therapy. And that was the hardest thing I have ever done. Just finding a therapist was way harder than it should have been. I decided to show my kids that even though I was damaged and broken I could be strong.\n\nI started being selfish in a good way. I started taking care of myself. If I couldn't get out of bed one day I didn't. I only did the bare minimum of what needed to be done. I dropped the kids off at school and came home and slept or just watched tv. I picked up the kids from school and ordered pizza.\n\nBut I only gave myself one day. My therapist called it my isolation day. The next morning I got up. I set goals for my self. One a week. Something simple. When I accomplished that goal I celebrated. Then set a new one for the next week.\n\nMy first goal was just going to the hardware store and picking out the paint for a furniture refab I wanted to do. When I say my therapist next I showed her a picture of my finished project. She was so proud of me she hugged me.\n\nIt's been a long hard journey and it will never end but I have learned to find joy in my life. I will never be cured and I will always have bad episodes but that's ok. I know they will end and I can get back to living.\n\nThere's an organization called \"Always keep fighting\" I've chosen to live by those words. When things are bad I take a sharpie and under my watch band write the letters AKF. I can just look at it remember that I am strong and I can get through this.",

            "comment": "Man. This is not a good thread to read through if you're struggling with suicidal ideation. \n\nThe...temptation of suicide is ever present once it's blossomed, I think. The idea abates but lingers, biding its time. You can still have so many things to be happy for, so many things to be Pollyanna-GLAD about, and still, the sticky sweet singsong of, \"but you could be done. You could be over it and not struggling any more. You could REST.\" chirps persistently in your ear. \n\nMany times friends say, \"come, talk to me when you feel this way.\" Therapists ask you to be open with them - \"are you feeling suicidal right now?\" At first, you want to trust them. But - almost always - with friends, you end up having to reassure THEM that you aren't going to ACTUALLY go through with it. The emotional toll of reassuring someone else when you are already feeling drained and fragile is a lodestone around the neck, cement shoes on a river during the first freeze. And therapists, bless their hearts (and I do mean that in the very Southernist way I can manage), tend to react and report you rather than listening. \n\nSay you end up in the hospital because you chose to check yourself in instead of follow through with your plan. You may also - as low income - end up in a facility with heavy drug users and addicts and other lost little puppies such as yourself, and you'll get so heavily medicated you walk around in an apathetic fog, still struggling to breath in enough air to not die in a way that feels more like murder. Group therapy will become the bane of your existence. \"Here, rip open your wounds in the company of strangers. You're safe here!\" a perky fresh-out-of-college or drained dead-around-the-eyes doctor will say. Nurses chat cherrily with patients. \"Oh, you'll be back! They always are.\" \n\nSo you withdraw more. You tuck away the horror you feel at the prospect of trudging through more struggles, bill roulette and day after day, week after week, of trudging through the motions at work. You hide your loneliness,  which at times threatens to overwhelm you with a black tidal wave of nothingness, under a veneer of cheerfulness and compassion and empathy. You learn to make your smile reach your eyes and body language when you want to weep for how much you long to be able to hold out your arms to someone - anyone - and say, \"help me! I just want to belong, to fit in, to have a place that feels like the Home I've read of in the stories.\" But you can't, and so you go about your days smiling but still hearing the quiet weeping of a small child tucked into a corner in the back room of your mind. \n\nAnd sometimes the weeping abates, and sometimes the beauty and joy around you slip in, like glorious little snapshots in a world full of dark gray. And you feel content. Warm, even. Happiness. And then, not right away, but eventually the crying of the small child is audible again. And you have to play the game of, \"reasons - what reasons do I have to stay. What reasons do I have that prevent me from leaving.\" \n\nYeah. Suicide can be seen as selfish. You like to think you own a piece of those who you love just as you give pieces of yourself to them to cherish as well. But sometimes - sometimes - on the days and nights when the weeping is the loudest, an inky black ocean of sorrow lapping at your feet as the tide threatens to come up and fully overwhelm you at last, as the storm clouds in your mind darken, and the apathy threatens to steal your very last sliver of breath from your very lips, then yes. I can understand - much better than I ever wished to - why the siren song of suicide could overcome a person, no matter how hard they tried to fight it. \n\nAnd hopefully, HOPEFULLY, if you didn't before, you can now too.

I took in the whole 100 count bottle of acetaminophen and I said some \u201coff\u201d things (my goodbyes) to my friends and they noticed and rushed over at midnight to tell my parents something was very wrong and called the ambulance.  I wouldn\u2019t fess up to what I did but they knew from my eyes that I wasn\u2019t okay either so they took me to the hospital and made me ingest the absolutely horrifying liquid charcoal.  I threw it up all over myself in the middle of the night but when I woke up at one point i saw my mom turned over praying and crying and I\u2019ll never forget it.  The other sight that stops me from it all now is my dad crying when they checked me into the ward.  In all of my life I had never seen him cry except for that one day.  \n\nPeople out there love you.  Even if you don\u2019t have family that supports you, friends are there.  Around two years after that I got pet bunnies and I love them to death.  I can\u2019t imagine leaving my pets behind and when I get emotionally distressed I go over and pet them in silence and it helps me calm down a little more and straighten myself out.  It\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s something.      Therapy helped me and my family open up to each other about things that I kept in that caused me to go over the edge.  Now, especially being someone who knows first hand what that dark void feels like I push to help my friends around me if I feel like they\u2019re going through the same thing.  \n\n",

My parents were having troubles in their marriage and my Dad would head over to the factory and work twelve hour shifts.\n\nI remember her crying a lot and feeling alone. I remember her striking a matchstick and pouring kerosene over her body. I remember crying and asking her to stop and then trying to fill a bucket of water in vain hoping to douse the flames that would soon engulf the apartment. \n\nI managed to get out of the house and I took my little sister with me.

Even as we moved countries and my life improved materially, I would frequently break into fights with my Dad and I barely interacted with my stepmom.\n\nI don't blame my mother.

I have learned to forgive my Dad but I still can't be in the same place as him.\n\nI have grappled with depression for many years and I struggle to form friendships and I hate it when I lose people. Breakups are especially hard.

So the depression is there. But the suicidal thoughts aren't. Any time it even crosses my mind randomly, I remind myself why I'm still here. But my life is important to me. I want to live to enjoy the good times and fight through the bad. I will survive. \n\nPlease, anyone that reads this. If you need help, get help. Your life is worth it. There's a lot of love and support out there if you need it. ",

I woke up violently vomiting and extremely upset because I shouldn\u2019t be here. I still think about suicide every day, but not in a really depressed way. I feel more like I\u2019m a background character just going with the flow not doing anything to differentiate myself from others. ",

            "comment": "My godfather killed himself November 4th 2013. Saying he was my godfather just doesn't do it justice. He was more like an older brother to me while he was my parent age he watched me grow and acted like a kid, he loved to just come over to my house and sit down in my room for hours keeping me company and playing games with me. He marveled at the new technology that came out and how video games were evolving. And whenever he would come over when I was with friends we would all run I say hi to him and jump to give him hugs.\n\nI have a very vivid memory of showing him super MARIO galaxy when it came out and playing on the world with the water bowl and swinging in circles on a vine. He thought it was the coolest thing in the world replying \"Wow. This is wild.\" He seemed to be the only adult in my life that still wanted to keep up on what I was interested in.\n\nFlash forward to 2013 where I'm a junior in high school. I'm having my issues with my mom and he's been around the house a lot as he's been feeling down. I enjoyed having him here. Made the house feel more alive and he was someone I could talk to when frustrated. I wish I had known how much pain he was in, I wish I asked him how he was doing. I was not ignorant to his depression but I did not know it's extent.\n\nOne day I am in my room on my bed and my mother walks to the door. I already knew what she was going to say. She was crying, I knew what had happened. My mother and he were very close and during this time I became a support for my mother as well as my other family members. I was so worried about them that I feel I barely processed his death even to this day.\n\nAt his funeral I knew that I had to speak, he was the closest thing to an older brother I had and I wanted to say that I loved him. When I spoke everyone knew who I was. I didn't know how, but I came to find out that he had told all of the people in his life who I was, how I was growing, and the person I was turning into. It was too much for me to handle and for the first time since finding out about his death I cried. I cried through the words I spoke about how I wish he knew how much I enjoyed hanging out with him, how much I loved spending my birthdays with him or walking through rivers together. I wish I had given him a call to tell him that I loved him. \n\nI don't know if anyone will read this; please if you love someone in your life or know someone who is hurting from depression or anything, give them a hug, call them and tell them you love them. Don't wait like me.",

            "comment": "I have that suicidal ideation. I feel it deeply, and often, and I can honestly and openly say that I wish I wasn\u2019t alive most of the time.\n\nI also feel that \u201creaching out and getting help\u201d will only lead to more debt, which will exaggerate a lot of my problems. I foresee that debt in the form of paying for a service to try and make me feel better or even the cost of depresssion medication. Then god only knows what side effects would come with that, etc.\n\nI feel trapped most of the time. I owe more than my salary in student loans, which means I\u2019ll likely never be able to marry or own a home or really make any decision at all that is bigger than buying a video game or two.\n\nI also can\u2019t even imagine a job exists that wouldn\u2019t be a total chore to get myself to. I work midlevel IT and make nearly $60k so technically I have it better than most. I don\u2019t mind what I do but I\u2019ll never be excited to do it. Then I spend my evenings anxious as fuck because my life is basically making sure others can access the internet, or intranet resources, or whatever.\n\nI don\u2019t own myself. I couldn\u2019t choose to walk away without putting myself in a worse situation. I\u2019m literally a hamster in a wheel and there\u2019s no way to break that loop. I want to die.",

            "comment": "I'm in my mid twenties (male) and I've had anxiety all my life and depression since I finished high school, never gone to a doctor about those two tho. I don't think I could ever kill myself while my parents are alive I just couldn't bare doing that to them, they don't understand why I always play games don't go out on the weekends or do things that people my age usually do. I haven't talked to them about it.\n\nVideo games for me are an escape, while playing I don't think about anything else and time just go by fast. I'm a loner, I know many people but they're all just acquaintances nothing more, I don't get invited to any events or contacted other than if someone needs something, my social anxiety has prevented me from gaining any experience with the opposite sex.  This all just adds to my depression, the sheer loneliness of my life.\n\nPeople will often say I'm funny or great to be around or I'm always smiling but that's just  me trying to hide the pain and maybe make someone else's day better, usually the people who are always smiling are the ones that are hurting the most. I finished college a few months ago and I could care less I have zero motivation. I daydream a lot and it helps me, I daydream about a normal life of having a girlfriend, travelling the world with her, a life without anxiety and depression and what that would be like, I don't think I've ever been in a social interaction without my axiety going through the roof I'm just always anxious about something, sometimes I'll stop and ask myself why is my heart racing what am I suppose to be anxious about then I'll remember that's it's something I have to do in a few days.\n\nI don't know what the next few years have in store for me nor where my life will take, I don't know if this is even appropriate to post here I'm second guessing myself but I'll do it anyway, I'm anxious on how someone will respond that's even going on in my head. I just felt like I needed to get it off my chest, this is actually the first time in my life I've ever expressed myself in any form on this topic. I could probably write 10 pages in detail on this.",

            "comment": "I have a question as someone who has struggled with suicidal ideation in the past. For the record I\u2019m doing really well right now and have no depression or suicidal ideation.\n\nCan someone tell me what I should expect to happen if I am feeling suicidal and I call a suicide helpline? Will they somehow track me down and call the police? When I have been at my lowest I have fortunately never been close to attempting but I have made plans and the last time even went so far as to gather important documents, write up a sheet of info for my husband about important accounts, passwords, etc. If I get to that point again, what would be the benefit of calling a helpline? Is there anything I can do now to prepare myself in case I\u2019m faced with that again? When I\u2019m in a good place I am able to see the value of a helpline but when I\u2019m at my lowest I keep it very hidden because I don\u2019t want anyone to get a clue and call the police or have me committed. What can I do to actually get myself help when I\u2019m in that kind of place, mentally speaking? \n\nOr what can my husband do? I have been very candid with him when I\u2019m not depressed and tell him how seriously he should take it if he ever hears me talk about ending my life. If we got to that point again, what should he do?",

He wasn't an idiot, quite the opposite actually, so I would think that he would get help if he had suicidal thoughts. Just a month or two ago he seemed normal, but ofcoarse we can't tell what he was thinking. When the police came to tell us that he was dead, it didn't even cross my mind that he had killed himself. It came as a big shock to everyone who knew him, his friends and relatives. We all miss him very much.",

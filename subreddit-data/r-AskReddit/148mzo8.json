Don Corleone taught me the my most important life lesson, something I live every single day with every breath I take, \u201cFriendship is everything. Friendship is more than talent. It is more than the government. It is almost the equal of family.\u201d",

I learned some people actually Did process their trauma in a way that made them become as cruel, if not more, than the terrible things that were inflicted upon them. I\u2019ve had my own trauma and have more than enough reason to be a bitter, cold broad, but I chose to give humans a chance to be better even if they Never chose to. I always try to expect the best of people even if I\u2019m always proved wrong. I don\u2019t change, regardless of what wrong has been done to me. Being cruel to that extent (as detailed in said book) is really unjustifiable and most importantly, it\u2019s real.",

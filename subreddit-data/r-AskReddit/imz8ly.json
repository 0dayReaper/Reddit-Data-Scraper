He is the Master of Australia by the will of the gods and master of millions of blokes by the inexaustible might of his armies. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat to humanity from invasive species, genetic mutations, and far, far worse.\n\nThese are the tales of those times. Forget the promise of of scientific progess and conservation.  There is no peace amongst the Outback, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter and the laughter of thirsting gods.\n\nIn the grim darkness of the far future, there is only the Emu War.",

He is bald and his head is a little shiny. he was sitting on a bench at a wildlife park and The emu must have been attracted to the shiny reflection, snuck up behind him and bit his head. I have never seen someone jump so far in one leap before or since. As a child this traumatised me a little and now I am pretty uneasy around all kind of birds.",

His father served a decade ago and really never kinda came back, you know? He once almost poked the his soon-to-be son's egg in a burst of anger. The machine guns are a foreign concept, you got to understand- they run and hit and stuff but can't shoot, can't comprehend that something can move that fast. There was a human raid on their peaceful community a week ago, and now emu-nationalists call for the ethnic cleansing of all of the human minorities living in Krikitititikitikiti and the surrounding cities of Krok and Pkaa'apkpk, where most humans live. He thinks, and I share this feeling, that everyone know this war from a human perspective, and people from all races- birds and non-birds- should learn the war from both sides.",

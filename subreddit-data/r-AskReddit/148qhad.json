Seriously I have no idea what set this guy off.  I was able to figure out who he was because he had posted tons of personal information.  Let them know oh sure you could probably figure out who I am too but I don\u2019t get visitors at my house, don\u2019t sleep much and that I\u2019m well armed.  Oh and that my neighbors are super nosy so if they saw a car on my property when I\u2019m not there they\u2019re just gonna call the cops if they don\u2019t wander over armed to see what\u2019s going on.  Guy had a freak out, it was hilarious.  \n\nSee I had no intention to harm anyone, I was in a local Vermont sub of all things but some crazy bastard from upstate New York decided I needed tuning up.  He didn\u2019t seem to realize that VT gun laws are not nearly as restrictive as NY and we tend to actually own them despite mostly being liberals.",

            "comment": "It extended outside of Reddit eventually, but I met the guy on Reddit-\n\nA few years back, this guy was pretty active on a fairly small subreddit I was a part of. Since the sub was so small, almost all of the members there were familiar with one another, if not already friends, so we interacted with this dude pretty frequently. We spoke with him under comments of his posts, added him to our gc, eventually making a Discord server and inviting him in it. However once we started speaking with him more, we realized something was just off with him.\n\nFor starters, he was a fat fetishist, and a very open one at that. Cool, whatever, I'm not here to kink shame, but that was weird for two reasons- 1. He spoke very openly about his fetish to people who were minors at the time (the average age of our friend group was like 13-15) and he was 28. And 2. He stated on multiple occasions that the reason he liked fat girls so much was because his *younger sister* was fat.\n\nHe would tell countless stories about his fantasies of sucking his sisters toes or getting with girls who *looked* like his sister. (He would always state he didn't want to get with his actual sister, just people who looked like her, which is still odd) Atp, we were all pretty weirded out by him, but the nail in the coffin was when he started making very suggestive comments towards a 13 year old girl we were friends with. He knew very well how old she was, and stated multiple times that \"age was just a number\". He got banned very quickly after that.",

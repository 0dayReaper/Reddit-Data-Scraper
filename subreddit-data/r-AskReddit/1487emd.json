This inmate had never spoken to me, and had never told anyone he was having friction with his cell mate. Well, when questioned about it, the inmate said he had told me he needed to be moved and I told him I would. Initially, my supervisors believed him, but after I pulled up the surveillance camera that showed i had never even gotten down to that area that night due to being on a mission from another one of my supervisors all night, they admitted I hadn't talked to him. However, the higher ups needed someone to blame and because it was my area, I got the blame, and got fired.\n\nAs a side note, I was salty about getting fired because I cared about my job but I wouldn't go back if they begged me. I have a much better job now and the prison is so short staffed because of how they treat their people, the officers are stuck doing 16 hour days, 6 days a week. No thank you.\n\nEdit: fuck it, what are they gonna do? This was the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.",

A group of us, not including the two having the affair, went for a trip to some hills that were about a 45 minute drive from our workplace. After walking around, we stopped for a drink at a quiet country pub. As I was walking from our pub table to the loo, I spotted the two affair colleagues sat at a table in a secluded corner of the pub, waved to them and carried on to the loo. I went and sat down, kept quiet about what I'd seen and each time somebody from our table went to the loo I'd watch as they came back with their lips pursed clearly trying to contain the urge to laught or gossip. Literally everybody could see what was going on. Finally, one girl came back from the loo, sat down and immediately blurted out \"did you see Steve and Yazmin over there? What are they up to?\" and everybody burst out laughing.",

I usually stay at jobs for a couple of years and I've never been fired before or since.\n\nThankfully, it didn't fully end my career, but I've struggled to get new jobs in the same sector ever since. Luckily I can do the same job, but in different (less lucrative) sectors.\n\nIt all happened because I thought someone was helping me, when actually she was actually a back-stabbing B*. \n\nShe was helping train me and explaining some VERY complicated inner workings of our company. She essentially explained how *\"Internally we talk about some products/services as 'B2C' and other products/services as 'B2B'. We don't talk like this to customers though, only internally.\"* (Sorry I have to be a bit vague here, otherwise explaining everything would take a whole Reddit post).\n\nWhat she said made perfect sense and it helped me understand some nuances in our services.\n\nA week or so later I was in a big meeting with lots of team leads trying to sort out a problem with a product that we were launching. And I asked the guy leading the meeting: *\"So just to be clear, is this to do with the ''B2B' products? I'm a little unclear.\"*\n\nHe looked at me like I was going crazy. *\"B2B? I don't understand. What are you talking about?\"*\n\nMe: *\"You know, how 'X' products are B2C. But 'Y' products are B2B and that helps us categorise them internally for projects like this.\"*\n\nThe guy just stared at me like I was weird. I turned to the girl who 'helped' train me. I kind of mumbled *\"How did you explain it the other day?\"*\n\nShe looked me dead in the eye balls, piercing the window of my soul, and said with a perfectly straight face: *\"I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.\"*\n\nSo she made me look like a total idiot in front of all the team leads, which ruined my credibility.\n\nWhen I had my monthly 360 performance review, I had really negative feedback from the team leads and she (as my trainer) had given me really bad feedback about \"not listening during training\". Which was total BS.\n\nThat incident didn't get me fired immediately. But she systematically worked out ways to make it look like I wasn't doing my job properly. So after 3 months, my probation period was coming to an end and HR saw my performance reviews and the reports that I \"wasn't doing the work\" (even though I was) and they said *\"We have to part ways.\"*\n\nTo this day, I still have no idea why she did this. \n\nWe were doing similar jobs, but different enough that I wasn't stepping on her toes. We were also at the same seniority and pay grade. And I generally get along with everyone, I definitely didn't say anything rude or mean to her to make her dislike me.\n\nSo I can't see a good reason for her to want me fired, other than she didn't like my face or something.\n\nShe acted so nice to me during training and around the office. I didn't know about all the negative stuff until it was too late.\n\nF-you, Sarah!",

I didn't really understand what I was doing, but felt trapped in the business because I couldn't think of anything else I'd be able to do. \n\nI got into it because around 2005-2010 social media was just becoming a big thing and old-school PR agencies would hire anybody who knew anything about Twitter, Facebook and all these exciting new channels. Pretty much all I had to do was show up to meetings and enthusiastically explain what social media was to confused old business dinosaurs. \n\nSo even though I knew nothing about PR and didn't really understand how agencies work, I quickly got over-promoted and for the first time in my life found I was in high demand, so I was getting paid more money than ever before. However, eventually social wasn't seen as such a big deal any more, so I found myself just trying to do whatever work they threw at me, hoping I could keep hold of that sweet salary for a little longer. \n\nBut because I wasn't into the job at all, I was always procrastinating, and I'd pull late nights to get work done at the last minute. \n\nOne day my boss asked to see my progress on a big client presentation that wasn't due for another week. I literally hadn't done a single thing on it, and I tried to bluster my way out of it, but the shit hit the fan and I got fired. \n\nOvernight I found I could no longer get interviews at agencies that used to be desperate for \"social media experts\" to work for them, and really started to worry about how I'd find another job.\n\nIn the end it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me, because out of desperation I took a temporary 3-month contract to do some basic marketing stuff at a small tech company and before my contract expired the company got bought by a bigger company. \n\nThey decided they needed a marketing director for my region, and because I was sitting in the right chair at the time, I got promoted and given a permanent contract. I was given plenty of time and space to figure out how to do the job as the company grew, so I felt much more comfortable in the role, not like I was constantly making it up as I went along. \n\nBeen there 7 years, love the job and the people, and earn more money than I ever thought I would.",

I'm sure nobody expected a kid like me to get any kind of happy ending. \n\nBUT - I was always a geek. Loved reading, loved video games. By sheer dumb luck there was a company near where I lived that published video-games magazines (back in the days when print magazines were still big), and I applied for a job as an office junior there without really knowing what they did. I was waiting to get into the army, but figured this job would pay a little money while I was waiting to go through the recruitment process and get sent off to basic training. \n\nAfter a couple of months of filling the coffee machine and tidying the place up, I convinced one of the editors to read an article I'd written - they pretty much instantly gave me a junior staff-writer job which led to a 10 year career in tech/video game journalism. \n\nThat eventually fell apart during the dot-com bust, when a lot of those old print-magazines went out of business and nobody had quite figured out how to make publishing online pay yet. \n\nThat was when I got into PR, because in my last writing gig I'd been covering the internet and social media, which made me an \"expert\" in their eyes. \n\nSo I've been failing upwards ever since I was 16.",

It was Thursday because that was taco soup day and this particular day it was extra spicy.\n\nTo get into the fill room, you have to spend like 45 minutes getting dressed in sterile room garb without touching the outside of your suits. It's quite the dance. So I'm in there sampling 100+ points of contact around the fill needle and my stomach starts grumbling. It's the end of the day, I don't want to leave and get dressed again. I look around and there are a few ladies working upstream on the conveyor belt looking for jams or whatever, and immediately after the fill needle, it goes out a little cutout in the window to be immediately packaged. The fill room itself has these cascading air pressures blowing away from the fill needle and is super loud.\n\nSo, that's my spot, I start to sample in that area, and let out a little 'pffffrrrrrrrrrrt!'. I feel better and go about my business. But then I start to hear this MOOOP MOOOP sound. Now, we have alarms, it's a stack of lights every few feet and a high pitched red light is a jam in the tracks somewhere, a blue alarm is something else, but this time a yellow alarm is going off. I look around unconcerned and see the ladies upstream are laughing their asses off. I look out to the packaging area and everyone is staring in the window at me. The line boss bangs on the window and demands that I see him outside. \n\nThere are hydrogen sulfide sensors around the sensitive areas of the line. That's because farts cause pink eye and I had just contaminated product. Thousands of bottles were thrown away and the line had to be purged for minutes before and after the 'incident'.\n\nIt took 15 minutes to properly disrobe, the whole time the rest of my QA department came to stare and laugh at me through the windows (you don't get naked l and they have to supervise you changing to make sure you do it right). When I got out, I had to sign several forms that claimed that I, Fr0thbeard, farted in the fill room. I got written up for it, but in my defence, so did the guy who trained me since he didn't mention the yellow alarms apparently. My boss let me go home early and I was forced out soon after.",

            "comment": "I fell down a flight of concrete steps and broke my back. I was a very successful dog trainer and my clients were supposed to deice their stairs in the winter and they didn't. I ended up lying in the snow for over 45 minutes before crawling to my car. I had to have my tail bone removed (coccydectomy) and I'm now handicapped from the waist down, although I can still walk (I have a cane for bad days and I stay in bed on flareup days). I was making $60-$100 an hour and now I get $850 off of disability for the month. And no, I didn't get a penny out of a lawsuit or a settlement or anything like that because I was too afraid to even tell my boss what happened because it was a very small business and I just couldn't afford to lose my job. Instead I lost my life.",

He has a Caucasian Shepherd as his service dog that he is training himself to pull his wheelchair and pick things up for him and whatnot. He is terminally ill with an insane amount of health issues, he had his legs amputated 20 something years ago. He\u2019s in pain 24/7. He has no access to pain meds or anything\nYou can do this, get back into dog training!",

That being said the fact that he was threatening legal action meant they had to withdraw the offer because they just didn't want the hassle.\n\nThat was several months of stress I would never want to ever revisit.",

This isn't to say firefighters don't deserve it (they **absolutely** fucking do) but so do the people that call out stuff that can go sideways before it happens to give you a chance to fix it first.",

I had been there for about 7 years and I knew I was most qualified, so I applied for the open sergeants position. I got it, which is where this story starts. \n\nAs a sergeant, it was my job to do investigations and document the findings whenever an inmate alleged his life was in danger. I would do the investigation and do a report on my findings, and it would get sent to the warden for them to interpret the evidence and make a final decision.\n\nSo, one day, an inmate gets beat up on a building I was in charge of. This inmate had never spoken to me, and had never told anyone he was having friction with his cell mate. Well, when questioned about it, the inmate said he had told me he needed to be moved and I told him I would. Initially, my supervisors believed him, but after I pulled up the surveillance camera that showed i had never even gotten down to that area that night due to being on a mission from another one of my supervisors all night, they admitted I hadn't talked to him. However, the higher ups needed someone to blame and because it was my area, I got the blame, and got fired.\n\nAs a side note, I was salty about getting fired because I cared about my job but I wouldn't go back if they begged me. I have a much better job now and the prison is so short staffed because of how they treat their people, the officers are stuck doing 16 hour days, 6 days a week. No thank you.\n\nEdit: fuck it, what are they gonna do? This was the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.",

Many of the patches were at the level of \"change the administrator password from 'password' to something less obvious\".  \n\nAs my political acumen was near zero at the time I didn't realize how the report on major security problems made the IT Director look completely incompetent in front of the entire department - he had built and configured the campus computer system pretty much on his own, at least in his mind, and was quite proud of his accomplishment.  \n\nHe suspended me on the spot, demoted me and tried to convince the university to fire me and try to bring me up on criminal charges for hacking into the university's computer systems.",

I usually stay at jobs for a couple of years and I've never been fired before or since.\n\nThankfully, it didn't fully end my career, but I've struggled to get new jobs in the same sector ever since. Luckily I can do the same job, but in different (less lucrative) sectors.\n\nIt all happened because I thought someone was helping me, when actually she was actually a back-stabbing B*. \n\nShe was helping train me and explaining some VERY complicated inner workings of our company. She essentially explained how *\"Internally we talk about some products/services as 'B2C' and other products/services as 'B2B'. We don't talk like this to customers though, only internally.\"* (Sorry I have to be a bit vague here, otherwise explaining everything would take a whole Reddit post).\n\nWhat she said made perfect sense and it helped me understand some nuances in our services.\n\nA week or so later I was in a big meeting with lots of team leads trying to sort out a problem with a product that we were launching. And I asked the guy leading the meeting: *\"So just to be clear, is this to do with the ''B2B' products? I'm a little unclear.\"*\n\nHe looked at me like I was going crazy. *\"B2B? I don't understand. What are you talking about?\"*\n\nMe: *\"You know, how 'X' products are B2C. But 'Y' products are B2B and that helps us categorise them internally for projects like this.\"*\n\nThe guy just stared at me like I was weird. I turned to the girl who 'helped' train me. I kind of mumbled *\"How did you explain it the other day?\"*\n\nShe looked me dead in the eye balls, piercing the window of my soul, and said with a perfectly straight face: *\"I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.\"*\n\nSo she made me look like a total idiot in front of all the team leads, which ruined my credibility.\n\nWhen I had my monthly 360 performance review, I had really negative feedback from the team leads and she (as my trainer) had given me really bad feedback about \"not listening during training\". Which was total BS.\n\nThat incident didn't get me fired immediately. But she systematically worked out ways to make it look like I wasn't doing my job properly. So after 3 months, my probation period was coming to an end and HR saw my performance reviews and the reports that I \"wasn't doing the work\" (even though I was) and they said *\"We have to part ways.\"*\n\nTo this day, I still have no idea why she did this. \n\nWe were doing similar jobs, but different enough that I wasn't stepping on her toes. We were also at the same seniority and pay grade. And I generally get along with everyone, I definitely didn't say anything rude or mean to her to make her dislike me.\n\nSo I can't see a good reason for her to want me fired, other than she didn't like my face or something.\n\nShe acted so nice to me during training and around the office. I didn't know about all the negative stuff until it was too late.\n\nF-you, Sarah!",

No kids involved, it was already obvious that neither were well-married, and no problems I heard of at work once the relationship became known since they were at the same level in the organisation but in different groups.\n\nWhat was funny about it was how some of us (their colleagues) found out. A group of us, not including the two having the affair, went for a trip to some hills that were about a 45 minute drive from our workplace. After walking around, we stopped for a drink at a quiet country pub. As I was walking from our pub table to the loo, I spotted the two affair colleagues sat at a table in a secluded corner of the pub, waved to them and carried on to the loo. I went and sat down, kept quiet about what I'd seen and each time somebody from our table went to the loo I'd watch as they came back with their lips pursed clearly trying to contain the urge to laught or gossip. Literally everybody could see what was going on. Finally, one girl came back from the loo, sat down and immediately blurted out \"did you see Steve and Yazmin over there? What are they up to?\" and everybody burst out laughing.",

I didn't really understand what I was doing, but felt trapped in the business because I couldn't think of anything else I'd be able to do. \n\nI got into it because around 2005-2010 social media was just becoming a big thing and old-school PR agencies would hire anybody who knew anything about Twitter, Facebook and all these exciting new channels. Pretty much all I had to do was show up to meetings and enthusiastically explain what social media was to confused old business dinosaurs. \n\nSo even though I knew nothing about PR and didn't really understand how agencies work, I quickly got over-promoted and for the first time in my life found I was in high demand, so I was getting paid more money than ever before. However, eventually social wasn't seen as such a big deal any more, so I found myself just trying to do whatever work they threw at me, hoping I could keep hold of that sweet salary for a little longer. \n\nBut because I wasn't into the job at all, I was always procrastinating, and I'd pull late nights to get work done at the last minute. \n\nOne day my boss asked to see my progress on a big client presentation that wasn't due for another week. I literally hadn't done a single thing on it, and I tried to bluster my way out of it, but the shit hit the fan and I got fired. \n\nOvernight I found I could no longer get interviews at agencies that used to be desperate for \"social media experts\" to work for them, and really started to worry about how I'd find another job.\n\nIn the end it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me, because out of desperation I took a temporary 3-month contract to do some basic marketing stuff at a small tech company and before my contract expired the company got bought by a bigger company. \n\nThey decided they needed a marketing director for my region, and because I was sitting in the right chair at the time, I got promoted and given a permanent contract. I was given plenty of time and space to figure out how to do the job as the company grew, so I felt much more comfortable in the role, not like I was constantly making it up as I went along. \n\nBeen there 7 years, love the job and the people, and earn more money than I ever thought I would.",

I grew up in a train-wreck of a family, borderline poverty - to the point that I was on a watch-list for social services because of concerns for my wellbeing. Left school at 16, having failed all of my exams, desperate to get away from my insane home-life. I'm sure nobody expected a kid like me to get any kind of happy ending. \n\nBUT - I was always a geek. Loved reading, loved video games. By sheer dumb luck there was a company near where I lived that published video-games magazines (back in the days when print magazines were still big), and I applied for a job as an office junior there without really knowing what they did. I was waiting to get into the army, but figured this job would pay a little money while I was waiting to go through the recruitment process and get sent off to basic training. \n\nAfter a couple of months of filling the coffee machine and tidying the place up, I convinced one of the editors to read an article I'd written - they pretty much instantly gave me a junior staff-writer job which led to a 10 year career in tech/video game journalism. \n\nThat eventually fell apart during the dot-com bust, when a lot of those old print-magazines went out of business and nobody had quite figured out how to make publishing online pay yet. \n\nThat was when I got into PR, because in my last writing gig I'd been covering the internet and social media, which made me an \"expert\" in their eyes. \n\nSo I've been failing upwards ever since I was 16.",

It was Thursday because that was taco soup day and this particular day it was extra spicy.\n\nTo get into the fill room, you have to spend like 45 minutes getting dressed in sterile room garb without touching the outside of your suits. It's quite the dance. So I'm in there sampling 100+ points of contact around the fill needle and my stomach starts grumbling. It's the end of the day, I don't want to leave and get dressed again. I look around and there are a few ladies working upstream on the conveyor belt looking for jams or whatever, and immediately after the fill needle, it goes out a little cutout in the window to be immediately packaged. The fill room itself has these cascading air pressures blowing away from the fill needle and is super loud.\n\nSo, that's my spot, I start to sample in that area, and let out a little 'pffffrrrrrrrrrrt!'. I feel better and go about my business. But then I start to hear this MOOOP MOOOP sound. Now, we have alarms, it's a stack of lights every few feet and a high pitched red light is a jam in the tracks somewhere, a blue alarm is something else, but this time a yellow alarm is going off. I look around unconcerned and see the ladies upstream are laughing their asses off. I look out to the packaging area and everyone is staring in the window at me. The line boss bangs on the window and demands that I see him outside. \n\nThere are hydrogen sulfide sensors around the sensitive areas of the line. That's because farts cause pink eye and I had just contaminated product. Thousands of bottles were thrown away and the line had to be purged for minutes before and after the 'incident'.\n\nIt took 15 minutes to properly disrobe, the whole time the rest of my QA department came to stare and laugh at me through the windows (you don't get naked l and they have to supervise you changing to make sure you do it right). When I got out, I had to sign several forms that claimed that I, Fr0thbeard, farted in the fill room. I got written up for it, but in my defence, so did the guy who trained me since he didn't mention the yellow alarms apparently. My boss let me go home early and I was forced out soon after.",

            "comment": "Way late to this, so it will probably get buried, but oh well.\n\nI used to be an arborist. I specialised in awkward tree removals, preferably big trees with structural issues and loads breakable, non movable objects (e.g. buildings, etc) around that needed to not be damaged. \n\nMy career was to the point where other local companies would call the company a worked for and ask if they could hire me out for a job that they were worried about. This isn't meant to be braggy, I'm definitely not proud of who I was at this time in my life.\n\nI took pride in the fact that I would climb almost anything. I used to love working, turning up every day and being pointed towards a sketchy tree and having a big adventure taking it down. Looking back, though, it was the most egotistical I've ever been in my life. I was a show off, I was extremely competitive towards anyone who i thought had similar or, god forbid, superior abilities to me, and I *needed* to be seen as fearless and a cut above the rest (no pun intended). I even got to the point where I would be incredibly rude to the ground crews if I thought they weren't working hard enough and were going to cause me to complete the job at a less impressive speed.\n\nAnyway in all my hubris I agreed to climb a tree that never should have been climbed, and only by sheer luck avoided being squashed like a bug between the trunk and the roof of an outbuilding when the tree decided to fall over as I was half way up getting ready to cut the second branch of the day off. \n\nI was mostly uninjured, but the mental toll was quite large. I totally lost my edge and started getting jittery and even backing out of perfectly stable trees. Ended up having to take a pay cut, nobody was requesting me anymore, that's for sure. I also developed vertigo, and any time i was up a tree it felt as if the tree was falling and the ground was rushing up at me. I couldn't sleep any night when I knew I had work the next day (which is most nights when you think about it). And I started having crazy anxious moments where my heart would beat really fast. I carried on like it for 2 years with minimal improvement because I had financial responsibilities and no skills for anything else. \n\nLuckily, I was eventually able to get work as a consultant in the same industry, which is a mixture of office based work and site visits that involve looking at trees instead of climbing them. But my career as a climber is definitely over.",

My manager was itching to get everything submitted in hopes that the loan would hit that month's scorecard, so she took the paperwork and said she'd stay until he could come back, which was after hours.\n\nThe next morning, she gave the folder back to me, saying that the loan guy had showed up later than they'd agreed, which meant the compliance department wasn't open, so she hadn't bothered to scan the documents and went home. She asked me if I had time to scan them, which I said I did.\n\nI did one last check to make sure everything was signed (as well as reorganize the documents in my preferred order), and triple checked to make sure the name change was good, then scanned everything.\n\nTwo days later I got pulled aside when I walked in the door, and got canned. I guess compliance runs signatures on loan documents, which is mostly used to confirm that signatures match, but also pings if signatures match **exactly*... and two signatures in the loan packet did. I got accused of copying a signature from a flood zone advisory and pasting it onto the name change form. They knew it was me because I'd signed the document list, I'd notarized several documents, and it had been scanned under my employee ID. Open and shut.\n\nI never got the satisfaction of asking my manager why, or what happened, but it doesn't really matter... like two months later everything went under lockdown due to COVID, including my daughter's daycare. I got to spend four months with her doing nothing but playing three year old make believe and mastering chocolate chip cookies, coasting off of unemployment. I found a job right when I needed to, and was making more money than I'd ever made within six months, and a series of title changes in the following year.\n\nSo, thanks shitass manager!

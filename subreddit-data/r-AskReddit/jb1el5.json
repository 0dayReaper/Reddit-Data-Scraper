In summary, the fall of Constantinople was kind of inevitable. The empire was in its last legs, due in large part to the the fall during the fourth crusade in 1204. It had a lot of internal and external problems. For example, Konstantinos Palaiologos was never officially coronated, due to religious infighting. The Ottoman empire had already conquered all of the farmland around, and was right to go for the kill at the time that it did. It conquered a great strategic and cultural landmark. The Hagia Sophia had already become a mosque in 29th May 1453, 2.30 in the afternoon. It's a pity for my heritage, but at that time I think it was inevitable.\n\nEdit: wtf guys thanks!! O.O\nEdit no. 2: Actually no, guys, the paper wasn't on There might be giants! It was on Greek folk laments on the event of the fall, and how accurate were their lyrics in relation to the actual event. (There were fairly accurate, also deeply sad and lamenting the loss of a symbol, mostly, not the city itself).",

Without those Who fled the distraction of the city we might never have had the return of Greek and Roman knowledge held by the Byzantines as the true heirs of Rome. In reality there was not much holding the remnants of the Byzantine Empire alive once the farmland in Anatolia had been conquered realistically the city would only be able to survive for so long. In addition the Ottomans raising taxes on trade would block off connections to China and India which would help to encourage the Spaniards and Portuguese as well as the Dutch later on in their maritime shipping interests. Truly the fall of Constantinople and in turn the Eastern Roman Empire was a sad but important event to propel us into the early modern age.",

                                    "comment": "Yup, I think it's exactly this. I would add that I think the ideological divide between physical skill and innovative skill correlates pretty closely to the divide between the general populace and the capital A art world that OP mentions. Whereas the general populace often has not invested much time in practicing art and admires the amount of practice a realist artist has put in their craft, those heavily invested in art have put in that practice themselves. Of course, they still admire others who have put in the same (or more) time practicing, but the real amazement to them comes from this original artistic vision you mention, and this can be due to several reasons.  \n\nOne reason for example comes from experiencing artist's block. While executional improvement progresses linearly through a steady stream of practice, innovative improvement often happens in waves with each wave slowed down by what we often call an \"artist's block\" or \"creative block\". Seeing others break through this block is really incredible to someone who has experienced the block a lot, but not as easily understood by someone who does not partake as much in creative matters and struggles with the block less often. Those invested in improving their own artistic vision also gain a sense of inspiration from these conceptually driven works which help popularize the works amongst the capital A art world. On the flipside, this sense of inspiration is lost to those who are not invested in improving their artistic vision, and so these people are missing an important internal feeling which would make a popular conceptual piece seem so good.  \n\nOf course there's also the matter of conceptual pieces highly relying on context that is often unaccessed by the general population, but that's another discussion.",

Unless it's Urban Graffiti, but even *that* is getting clich\u00e9 \n- computer art? *tinkling, patronizing laughter* do you want to work for Disney or something?\n- \"I *knew* Andy [Warhol], he was darling!\"\n- Surrealists are like Freud, there will *always* be *somebody* who buys into it\n- wrapping buildings?  *more laughter*  it's \"Bread and Circuses!\"\n\nThere is art and artists, and then there is ART.  While there are and always will be brilliant, talented, innovative people who will push boundaries, disrupt the status quo, and bring conversations to the masses about what Art *is*, they will majority of people have smaller spectrum/viewpoint regarding what is Art.

Everything was arranged more or less chaotically in dark, narrow rooms. Some paintings were without frames, some hanging from strings from the ceiling. The walls were painted with slogans such as \"Madness becomes method\", \"deliberate sabotage of national defense\" and \"revelation of the Jewish racial soul\".\n\nIt sounds absolutely insane.\n\nConcurrently they hosted another exhibition called the \"Great German Art Exhibition\" which was supposed to show the more \"racially pure\" type of art the Nazis advocated for. People at the time described it as mediocre and it only attracted about half as many visitors as the Degenerate Art one.",

This show portrays both sides of the conflict in a very objective manner and as for someone who thinks history should be taken into account from every possible perspective this show is great for that.",

Once he decided to use artillery in a way that had never been used before, there was no turning back. The Wolf and her cubs (Orban) not only provided drive for the exhausted troops, but also a distraction for the Turks inside the walls.  After suffering wounds himself, Mehmed and his advisors (who knows exactly whose idea it was first) decided to circumvent the Golden Horn, pull the boats out of the water, and place them back in on the other side of the boom chain.  The gig was up!  Morale fell inside the walls, and the best fighters knew it was over.\n\n\" He rode immediately to the Hagia Sophia, He ordered to be protected. He transformed it into a Muslim Mosque, solidifying Islamic rule in Constantinople.\"\n\nMehmed completed his Grandfather and father's wish. He didn't stop there!  He successfully defended Constantinople  and led conquests throughout the surrounding lands. Morea, Trebizond,  I liked reading about the Ottoman-Venetian War.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, what I think about it.  Throughout history we see large significant battles and huge stories to go with it.  I like that I can really get to the Micro history of Mehmed himself. I sorely wish I could travel back and be a fly on the wall during these times.  Throughout the history of Humanity, we have fought for land in the name of a God or Gods.\n\nWhen do we start to fight for Humanity? Would it even be \"fighting\" if no one died?",

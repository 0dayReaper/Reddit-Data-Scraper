But they'll be in a position to hire someone hourly, not based on assets under management (and at those figures, you'll certainly get charged well below 1% of AUM). Lawyers aren't going to be comfortable advising you on finances because that's not their line of work (and their malpractice carriers may not cover such recommendations). \n\nIf you are going to use someone for advice, look for someone who has many years of experience, a squeaky clean record, and who works as an employee for one of the largest broker-dealers. Because then, if the employee does go rogue and give you bad advice, there are more layers of supervision and a firm you can sue for their negligence in allowing the employee to give bad advice.",

Pretty soon people will find out that good ol' Jeff Worthy is helping you to handle all those millions for you, Jeff probably won't tell them himself, but someone will, someone will have loose lips. \n\nNow Jeff is heading down the local bar on a Friday night, and there he runs into his cousin; ol' Billy-Bob Fuck-knuckle. Billy-Bob also knows about the money, and Jeff owes him a favor from way back when, and Billy-Bob is now gonna call in that favor. Jeff might turn him down, but there's a lot of people your local attorney does business with, and they all want a piece of that pie you just won, and they're all gonna hassle Jeff for it. How long do you think Jeff will be able to deal with that?\n\nAnd once more; your pal Jeff might be trustworthy now, but how much does a local attorney make? $100k/year? $200k? Suddenly you come waltzing in with *millions*, Jeff just might think you're not gonna notice an few extra expenses here and there.\n\nNo one in your hometown is going to know anyone from the big city lawyers of Schmuck, Putz, and Partners.

If they're even so much as suspecting of breaking their client's confidentiality, or defrauding them, their law firm is in the tank by the end of business that day.",

John and Lisa were hesitant because they felt they needed to verify that they won first, the lawyer assured them that it was better to get ahead of the press, and that meant not going through the lottery commission until later (because the commission would announce the names of the winners, and press would jump on it).\n\nThey go on the show with their lawyer (on camera), John pulls out the ticket to show the world that he won. Not a copy, *the actual goddamn ticket*. John didn't want to do that, he wanted to put it in a safety deposit box and bring a copy.

At the morning I would visit the local bakery and buy some breakfast, then maybe catch some fish on my own dock, or maybe riding a jetski with friends. Take my old car for a ride and wave to every other person because I know them. Then building a project car when the parts would finally come. Cook a dinner or if I am lazy I could just order something. Then at the evening I could just enjoy being alive or I could open my PC and go play with my friends.\n\nI want a simple life, nothing too fancy but without worrying how am I going to pay all the bills. I could just pay the tickets and everything if someone want to come and visit me. If it would come boring at somepoint, I could just pack my things and go do something else, keeping the house but renting it for someone in need.",

My wife can too.  \nWe could enjoy a seaside town, walks on the beach etc without the massive tourist-trap aspect of Cornwall.  \n\n\nLottery may not actually be required to achieve the dream..",

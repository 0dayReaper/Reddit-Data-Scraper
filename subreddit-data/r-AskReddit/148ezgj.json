But they'll be in a position to hire someone hourly, not based on assets under management (and at those figures, you'll certainly get charged well below 1% of AUM). Lawyers aren't going to be comfortable advising you on finances because that's not their line of work (and their malpractice carriers may not cover such recommendations). \n\nIf you are going to use someone for advice, look for someone who has many years of experience, a squeaky clean record, and who works as an employee for one of the largest broker-dealers. Because then, if the employee does go rogue and give you bad advice, there are more layers of supervision and a firm you can sue for their negligence in allowing the employee to give bad advice.",

He's been loyal, and hard working, and he's never done any of your family wrong. You get him to do all the things that post says to do, by the book. Pretty soon people will find out that good ol' Jeff Worthy is helping you to handle all those millions for you, Jeff probably won't tell them himself, but someone will, someone will have loose lips. \n\nNow Jeff is heading down the local bar on a Friday night, and there he runs into his cousin; ol' Billy-Bob Fuck-knuckle. Billy-Bob also knows about the money, and Jeff owes him a favor from way back when, and Billy-Bob is now gonna call in that favor. Jeff might turn him down, but there's a lot of people your local attorney does business with, and they all want a piece of that pie you just won, and they're all gonna hassle Jeff for it. How long do you think Jeff will be able to deal with that?\n\nAnd once more; your pal Jeff might be trustworthy now, but how much does a local attorney make? $100k/year? $200k? Suddenly you come waltzing in with *millions*, Jeff just might think you're not gonna notice an few extra expenses here and there.\n\nNo one in your hometown is going to know anyone from the big city lawyers of Schmuck, Putz, and Partners. And at SP&amp;P they handle massive accounts like yours on the daily. If they're even so much as suspecting of breaking their client's confidentiality, or defrauding them, their law firm is in the tank by the end of business that day.",

John and Lisa were hesitant because they felt they needed to verify that they won first, the lawyer assured them that it was better to get ahead of the press, and that meant not going through the lottery commission until later (because the commission would announce the names of the winners, and press would jump on it).\n\nThey go on the show with their lawyer (on camera), John pulls out the ticket to show the world that he won. Not a copy, *the actual goddamn ticket*. John didn't want to do that, he wanted to put it in a safety deposit box and bring a copy. The lawyer insisted John bring the original because a copy would make it seem like they were lying. Dude flew from Tennessee to New York with $200million in his pocket...because his lawyer told him to do it.\n\nNeedless to say, the internet dogpiled on John and Lisa for being monumentally stupid.

Take my old car for a ride and wave to every other person because I know them. Then building a project car when the parts would finally come. Cook a dinner or if I am lazy I could just order something. Then at the evening I could just enjoy being alive or I could open my PC and go play with my friends.\n\nI want a simple life, nothing too fancy but without worrying how am I going to pay all the bills. I could just pay the tickets and everything if someone want to come and visit me. If it would come boring at somepoint, I could just pack my things and go do something else, keeping the house but renting it for someone in need.",

If I won they would never leave me alone (well, they don't as it is, but I can move and never tell them). After doing all due diligence with the lawyers, I would pay my mil back to be done with her. We were struggling and she convinced us to borrow a huge sum of money from her. I didn't want to, but at the time I didn't understand how to have boundaries. She made it an amount that would make it hard to pay back, and then when we would start paying her she would tell us to only pay so much, or put it towards the kids, only to complain when we don't give her more. She uses money to abuse and I am done. As it is now, we are doing what we can. I am done with this woman and how awful she is. To tell you just how much she has tried to get us not to repay her and keep us on the hook forever, she wanted my husband to start a bank account that they were both on that she could funnel money through. She claimed she was safe guarding it from her husband's kids and it would still be her money, but we could totally use it. Now I have boundaries and I told her absolutely not. She and her husband have to be adults and talk about it. The only thing keeping her in our lives is this debt to her and the fact I was trying to allow my kids to have one set of grandparents. My parents are incredibly abusive and we don't see them because of safety. I had hoped that she would be good to them. But she love to hurt me as much as possible and it has to stop.\n\nAfter that, I would move. I wouldn't tell most people where I went, either. Not my mil, or my family. Just a handful of friends. It would be a place with a gated community, not because of the people of the area, but security from my abusers. I would want my massage chair. I would want a vacation with some friends who I trust.

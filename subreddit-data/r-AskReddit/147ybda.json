I drove him to the closest ER where the nurse and doctor were concerned with small details for a half-hour. A minute hadn't passed while he was on a transporter before he had a massive seizure following a heart attack. He started grunting and foaming at the mouth. The doctor held my dad's limp arm, said out loud *uh guys* and scanned the room like it was his first day on the job, and by the third minute they began CPR. The lack of urgency was surreal. In the trauma room, his heart stopped three more times so they put him on a ventilator. On the way to the hospital, he had another cardiac arrest. He suffered four more in a span of a week in the ICU where my mom decided to stop resuscitation measures.\n\nA couple days ago, I drove to the ER because I had strange chest pain all week and my blood pressure was the same as my dad's minutes before his heart attack. I learned I had developed PTSD witnessing it all. I'm still sour and upset about the whole situation. While he was in the ICU, my mom told me, two days before I took him to the ER, about how a near traffic collision triggered his chest pain and I'm so devastated they hadn't bothered to check that out. In her eulogy, she'd mention that it was all sudden, with no signs to indicate a possible risk and I couldn't take it. On my way to the hospital, to rub salt into the wound, I was tailgating a cop and listening to the radio host speak up about getting checkups for early onset heart attack symptoms. As much as my dad liked to advocate the healing effects of alkaline water and vegetable juicing, he didn't pay attention to his health as well as he should have and it's so distressing to come to terms with because my mom is a nurse and so was his sister.",

He had 4 blocks and had to undergo surgery immediately. To this day, I am so so grateful to the way things went because I could take him in time.

Hate for the Jews was something that was common not only in Germany, but all of Europe and beyond basically. At the end of the 19tj century, anti-Judaism transformed into anti-Semitism which followed a \u201escientific\u201c, racial purity logic flanked by eugenics, race science and modern conspiracy theories. Hitler used these sentiments for political gain and pushed them to the extreme, i.e. he introduced eliminatory policies instead of the \u201emere\u201c oppression and social exclusion of old.",

But no matter how much I calculate, no matter how many bullet points I lay out to explain the domino effect for why this would be better, the reality is I have no idea. I can't predict how things would change and if the Butterfly Effect is real, this could have catastrophic consequences on the world.  And if it's not real, then there's no guarantee these changes will make a difference. If Booth never shoots Lincoln, who's to say history doesn't just find somebody else? \n\nTo keep things as safe as possible, I would need to choose something a lot closer to home. I guess I'd go with getting Clinton elected over Trump, but that was seven years ago and even that is pushing it. Still, among other things, it would lead to a lot fewer people dying of Covid in America.",

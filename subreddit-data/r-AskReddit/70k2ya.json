            "comment": "Sorry if this ends up being long but its angered me for quite some time.\n\nAbout ten years ago my mother at age 69 had a massive stroke. They didn't expect her to live let alone come out of it mostly alright. Which she did except for some vision loss in her left eye. (Not total, just peripheral.) So she can only see perfectly straight out of that eye.\n\nSo after about a year recovering from the stroke and the ensuing infection from the surgery that ended up being worse then the stroke itself she decides she wants to go get tested to see if she can retain her drivers license. (Required by law in my province of Canada).\n\nMy father was not well either as he had a long term terminal illness so I pack them both up in my truck and take them to the DMV. Me and my father happily assuming there is no fucking way in hell she will pass. \n\nAside from her vision issues, the amazingly quick witted and swift woman I grew up with was VERY unsure of her self at all times and took forever to make the smallest decisions. It broke my heart and it didn't even occur to me to be scared that she would get her license back.\n\nWell she did, passed with \"Flying colors\" the DMV guy said. As a SAR (Search and Rescue) tech, the idea of taking him up in the helicopter and throwing him out without a rope occurred to me.\n\n1 week later, accident number one. T-boned a poor lady as she was coming out of the grocery store. Not much damage and no injuries thankfully. Mother still refused to admit she wasn't fit to drive.\n\nMonth later, accident 2. She panics on a multi-lane cross city road and ends up on the raised median and rips the entire exhaust system off her car. Still won't admit any issues.\n\nAt this point I'm amazed I didn't have ulcers. Shortly after accident 2 my father passed away. I did everything up to and including begging to get her to give up the license. She wouldn't do it and for the next few months I spent every day with a knot in my stomach until I spoke to her around 6pm every night once she was \"home from running around\" \n\nThen around 1pm I get a call from her cell phone, this phone I bought her that she mostly ignored except to charge it. I couldn't understand a word she said she was so upset on the phone. I managed to get her general location out of her and hopped in a car and more then exceeded the speed limit getting down there.\n\nUpon arriving there are two ambulances, shoes in front of her car and its up on the curb.\n\nShe's sitting on the curb next to it bawling her eyes out and I'm terrified she's killed someone.\n\nTurns out a man and his son were walking out of the soccer pitch next to the road, began to cross on the cross walk and she didn't see them.\n\nShe thankfully only struck the father and aside from being banged up he wasn't super seriously injured.\n\nBecause of my job I knew most of the police officers in the city so one of them offered to follow me back to her house so she could take me back down to get her car.\n\nBy the time I had done so and got back to her condo she had stopped crying. Threw me the extra set of keys to the car she had and told me to get rid of the car.\n\nShe even tried to get the DMV worker that passed her fired after that. She immediately realized she shouldn't of ever gotten it back. She was actually terrified that she had been driving like that.\n\nYears later she still comments about how she never even saw the man and his son and how she could of killed one or both of them.\n\nI have all the respect in the world for seniors. My mother was one of the first women CEO's in this province and was a hellcat in her day. I learned a lot from her. But I also learned to accept limitations.\n\nIf you are older reading this post. If you think for even a second that you could maybe not be the safest person to be on the road, talk to and listen to your loved ones.\n\nIts horrible to give up that freedom, it would be more horrible for you to kill some innocent person because you are too proud to give it up.\n\n\n**EDIT** Thanks for the gold mysterious stranger!",

If you see someone with an elderly tag, you might not assume that driver sees everything you do or reacts as quickly as you do.\n\nI had trouble getting my dad to quit driving because I knew he couldn't see. (He couldn't tell me from my daughter from across the room.)\n\nI called the DMV for suggestions and the sent him a letter to come in for a vision test.\n\n*He passed.*\n\nHe was in his 90s with cataracts and dementia. We had a lot of rancor over this issue and he ended up living with my brother whom he would actually listen to. And he quit driving.",

I answered him honestly (if sarcastically) and said, \"I don't know, they're all about 10 inches away in a wooden box.\" All he said was \"Uhuh\", and passed me. He probably just thought I was some asshole kid, but he didn't do anything to follow up me saying, very clearly, that I couldn't tell.",

Maybe I can help for clarity. \n\nWhen it comes to depth perception, we need to give that part of the test but you can't technically fail that part where I'm at. If your depth perception sucks I need to tell you that objects may be closer than they appear, but we licence those with vision in only one eye, which is 0 depth perception. \n\nAs long as you have 20/30 vision, no diplopia, and adequate peripheral vision (120\u00b0), you're likely to pass. \n\nEdit: And not severely colour blind.",

Turns normally honest people into thieves, and makes the most outlandish crazy ideas seem positively brilliant. Then there's the belligerence.

Meanwhile you're walking around like Hunter S on ether, slurring incoherently, and there's melted ice cream and sweet tarts coating your mouth and shirt. People on benzos are a fucking nightmare to deal with, especially if it's a friend, Now you're babysitting the most petulant, disagreeable toddler, except they're a 25 y.o adult.",

Similar story in that there had been complaints/previous accidents that were not taken very seriously. You know, until she literally ran two kids over (and didn't stop, either...she apparently did not realize that she had hit them, and only stopped when she ran into a creek ditch in the park down the street from the boys). I believe she may have had dementia, as well. The DMV pretty much refuses to do anything with elderly drivers. But elderly people need transport options if they can't drive. That's the biggest thing, I think. My mom tried to get my grandpa's license taken away (I mean, he really shouldn't have been driving), but despite literally living next door to him, she was appallingly unhelpful when it came to driving him around. I mean, he wasn't going to magically start taking the bus after 60 years of driving, you know? Set up a Lyft account for your elderly, or a taxi account, or drive them, something, anything. Yes, take their licenses when necessary, that needs to be improved, for sure. But don't leave your elders stranded, either, you know? (Not directed at you, specifically, YellowRiceMacaroons, just sort of society in general)",

We have to have an alternative for the elderly if we're going to improve our odds of getting them off the roads when they no longer qualify.\n\nI'm currently paid through Medicaid to take care of my disabled dad (like many families in my boat.. all of that money goes back to his care). It would be cool to see a similar program set up for the designated driver of someone who has failed their driving test and/or has a debilitating condition, like dementia. \n\nBecause unfortunately... Time constraints can make transporting the elderly difficult, and some just may not be able to afford the additional cost. My dad lives a 20 minute round trip away,  taking him to his doctor and back takes an hour, etc. I go to my dad's almost daily. I can see why it would be rough driving an elderly relative.\n\nAnd I get why a relative would cling to being able to drive because of that. Many elderly women in my grandma's social circle couldn't drive, so they would turn a blind eye to their husband's medical issues, not wanting to face it. \n\nOne's husband was being pulled over by the police. He had dementia. He let them on a high speed chase, crashed into the back of a semi. He was the only death, thankfully, no one else hurt.",

I work in a primary care clinic and if a provider notices that you probably should not be driving (for example: just suffered a stroke and don't have that coordination back yet, if you can get it back; your Parkinson's has gotten worse; reports from family that you've been having difficulty with memory or other coordination issues) they will have no problem telling the DMV to revoke your license.  They may NOT tell you that they were the reporter.  To get their license back the patients have to go to a separate testing center that doesn't have anything to do with or is connected to the DMV, and they have to pass a written test and a physical test.  The provider then gets that recommendation and then will pass that onto the DMV for reinstatement if that's the case.  \n\nHonestly, your primary care provider does not want to find out that you hit a pedestrian, caused an accident, or died going to the grocery store.  We prefer you pissed off and yelling at us rather than injured/dead.  ",

The frequency that they casually drop \"my doctor told me I can't drive anymore\" coupled with the fact that they drove to my office is terrifying. One woman could barely walk, who also told me she couldn't see while I was demonstrating something to her...got in her car and drove away after her appointment. There's another man who constantly tells us he \"donated\" his car to someone who needed it but regrets it because he has to take the bus everywhere. The son told us they literally had to take it away because he kept driving on sidewalks and running lights, and he refused to stop driving after his license was suspended for drunk driving. I watched another woman just yolo pull away from the curb as she was leaving, nearly causing a multi-car pile up. One woman came in because she had head trauma from an accident she caused. She drove herself.  \n\nOh...also I've also had my bumper smashed in by a patient just trying to park in the spot next to me.  \n\nI get a full dose of their cognitive skills in my office. There are many times I'm pleasantly surprised at how sharp they still are... but more often than not I'm afraid for those who are sharing the road with them on their way home. While I agree they do deserve the dignity of having the same rights as everyone else, I do not believe that right should supersede the safety of literally anyone else on the road with them.",

It just solves so many problems - especially the social aspect - by putting seniors in their \"own\" communities. I have to admit that it is an extremely complicated issue all around, both morally and fiscally. Just how much of our tax money should go towards the elderly? It is tough for me to justify in my head why a nation should spend a ton of money on the elderly while so many of our youth are so underprivileged. Then I realize that if we just allocated ~3-4% of our national defense budget for seniors and at-risk youth it would seemingly take care of several major issues in both categories. ",

It's hard for people, like doctors or DMV employees, to tell someone who's probably been driving for decades that they're no longer allowed to do that, so I can see their motivation behind wanting to \"help them out a little\"... But it's incredibly short sighted. Around the time my grandfather had to stop driving (because my mom and grandma basically told him he couldn't do it anymore), he was pretty well into Alzheimer's. Think of all of the terrible things you've heard Alzheimer's does to someone's mind - now imagine that person is in charge of driving around a 4,000 lbs box of motorized death. If he'd had to make a split second decision on the road, it would have ended badly. Another personal experience for me with an elderly driver is the woman who backed her car into my car at a Walmart parking lot as I was honking my horn at her. I had to get out and smack on her window to get her attention - she hadn't seen me, didn't hear my horn, and didn't feel that she had hit another car. How is a woman who is completely oblivious of her surroundings fit to be behind the wheel of a car? Simple: she's not.\n\nLosing the ability to drive is sad, but is it as sad as someone getting killed? Is it worth endangering lives just so an elderly person isn't angry because they can't drive? Probably not.",

Her doctor was just like \"ok she passed she can drive.\" Like uhhhh I don't think she needs to be driving, her daughter lives literally 5 minutes away and can take her wherever she needs to go! ",

From going 30kmph in a 70kmph zone, to watching them stare out the side window while going through that same zone. They swerve from side to side. I refuse to go anywhere with my grandpa driving, as he is now a horrible driver and has nearly crashed the car multiple times, then blames it on other drivers. \n\nHowever, I won't say that only elderly people need to be tested. I would hate having to do so, but we ALL should be tested. Just last night teenagers drove over a schools fence in a large truck. People saw them, cops haven't caught them. Younger people speed more, usually 70 in a 50. \n\nIn just today, I got stuck behind someone doing 20kmph in a 50 zone, and then while I was going 60kmph someone flew past me like I was standing still. The roads would be better if we were all retested, and in regards to my town, if cops would actually do their job. Going severely under the speed limit is dangerous just as speeding is. \n",

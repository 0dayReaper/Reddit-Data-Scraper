            "comment": "At the time I thought it was because I couldn't wait for him to grow up anymore, as he was very childish despite the fact he was older than me I was 26 and he was 30. We started dating when I was 17 and he was 21. When we met I was very depressed having had a breakdown after a loss at 15. 9 months and some therapy later I know it was a very abusive relationship which I tolerated because of my terrible childhood. He was also likely a predator. \n\nWe met online and then met up and the first couple of times everything was fine, within the first year he strangled me and punched me in the side of the head. He was only physically violent 8/9 times that I recall and most happened in the first 4 years of our 8.5 year relationship. The last 4.5 years were what can only be described as like living in a powder keg, almost every single day he'd get mad about something, he'd snap, he'd scream, he'd punish me, he'd use the fact I couldn't drive at the time to keep me from my family and friends.\n\nI was living in hell. But I was supposed to marry him and everyone wanted a wedding.\n\nThe last years of our relationship we'd completely stopped having sex (he had his own issues and I think he was asexual to be honest) so our relationship was just a friendship, but it wasn't because he was such a horrible person 95% of the time that the friendship died.\n\nI used to sit on the floor of the bathroom at 3am and cry because I was so miserable and felt so trapped, then one day my younger sister (who I mostly raised) turned to me and said \"you do realise you're in an abusive relationship?\" and I couldn't ignore it anymore. \n\nI broke up with him and made him leave and he spent the next 5 months trying to get me back, constantly going between declarations of love and guilt and abusive vile texts calling me everything under the sun.\n\nMy life is immeasurably better, I feel like I can breathe again.",

The grandma who ran the place wouldn't let us leave without trying her chicken mol\u00e8.  I'm not usually a fan (it's usually too sweet) but Holy shit.\n\nIt was the most savory, complex, perfectly balanced thing I'd ever had.  I wasn't even hungry, and I got seconds.  Sadly that was before smart phones, so I could never find that   place again.  And I looked.  Kind of makes it cooler that it was a once in a lifetime experience.  I guess.",

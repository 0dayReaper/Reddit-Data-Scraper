I was puking all day saturday..I couldn't keep down even water and thought my skin looked a strange color so I thought I should go to the doctor..Was extremely weak too. Some anti-vomit/nausea medicine and an IV and I felt better in a few hours.\n\nI kinda wonder if I actually should have gone or if I should have toughened it out for 24 hours and hoped to get better.. I have no one to take care of me while I'm sick and I was worried of becoming \"too sick\" too..\n\n-edit.. I live in socal seems to be going around the US?..Weird thing is that I hardly go out and get in contact with people. Like I can pinpoint exactly where I got it from and when.. Which was when I went out for some fast food on friday night..It was my favorite place so maybe one of the employees got sick a few days earlier and didn't wash enough? or a customer got sick and their sick germs were all over the place.. I do know the norovirus is extremely contagious..\n\nWas also wondering if I should call them and tell them I got the stomach flu from their place or not..",

No notice necessary.\"  \n\nOne day, he starts bitching at me.  I said, \"Okay, I'm out of here.\"\n\nHe says, \"Wait, what about two weeks' notice?\"  \n\nI said, \"How about you notice for two weeks that I'm not here?\"  \n\nI didn't make up that line.  I heard it somewhere.  I got to use it, though.  \n\nHe said, \"Hold on.  Let me go talk to my boss.\"  \n\nI said, \"Sure, you go do that.  I'll be getting my things.\"  \n\nI got my things and said, \"See ya later,\" to my peers, then left.",

Spent a lot of time on pre-transfer business (at the beach) and not so much time actually working.  One day I came into my chief petty officer's office and he lit into me.  \"Oh, look who decided to show up today!\" He just starts yelling until he's red faced and spitting \"....sick of your attitude and your not giving a shit.  You will be in this division at work all day every day until the day you check out!\"  Deep breath.  \"Now, when do you check out?\"\n\nMe:  \"Today.\" And I slapped my check out sheet on his desk.",

Boss was a massive dickhead.\n\nIt was my last day on my 2 week notice and he wanted me to yell at one of my employees because they weren't actively doing something. I explained that the employee had spent the last 3 hours working on freight and were taking a break. Boss said he didn't care and told me again to \"hold him accountable\".\n\nI told him to go fuck himself, took off my apron, dropped it on the floor, and walked out of the store.",

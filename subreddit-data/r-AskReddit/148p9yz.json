No notice necessary.\"  \n\nOne day, he starts bitching at me.  I said, \"Okay, I'm out of here.\"\n\nHe says, \"Wait, what about two weeks' notice?\"  \n\nI said, \"How about you notice for two weeks that I'm not here?\"  \n\nI didn't make up that line.  I heard it somewhere.  I got to use it, though.  \n\nHe said, \"Hold on.  Let me go talk to my boss.\"  \n\nI said, \"Sure, you go do that.  I'll be getting my things.\"  \n\nI got my things and said, \"See ya later,\" to my peers, then left.",

Spent a lot of time on pre-transfer business (at the beach) and not so much time actually working.  One day I came into my chief petty officer's office and he lit into me.  \"Oh, look who decided to show up today!\" He just starts yelling until he's red faced and spitting \"....sick of your attitude and your not giving a shit.  You will be in this division at work all day every day until the day you check out!\"  Deep breath.  \"Now, when do you check out?\"\n\nMe:  \"Today.\" And I slapped my check out sheet on his desk.",

Boss was a massive dickhead.\n\nIt was my last day on my 2 week notice and he wanted me to yell at one of my employees because they weren't actively doing something. I explained that the employee had spent the last 3 hours working on freight and were taking a break. Boss said he didn't care and told me again to \"hold him accountable\".\n\nI told him to go fuck himself, took off my apron, dropped it on the floor, and walked out of the store.",

Rich was kind of nice, a little uptight. Matt was a total fucking asshole and gradually revealed himself to be very very racist. Like, it would start where he would ask me to \u201cWatch,\u201d people in the store but I noticed he only ever asked me to watch people of color. Then he started saying more and more racist stuff, dropping in comments and that. Then this one time I had these customers at the front I was ringing up, and he makes this really loud racist comment I will not repeat here from the back room. Like directed at my customers but pretending he was just saying it into the air (and no one could see him). About 15 or so minutes later I left to take his lunch break, I left a sticky note on his computer telling him \u201cI\u2019m quitting because you\u2019re a racist. Fuck off.\u201d and walked out.",

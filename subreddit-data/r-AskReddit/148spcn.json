            "comment": "Oatmeal (not instant) and strawberries.\n\nEggs, any way you want them.\n\nWhole wheat french toast. Be sure to toast the bread before soaking in egg. \n\nWhole wheat is always better, no matter what it is- pasta, bread, flour- try to use whole wheat. If you dont change anything beyond cutting out white pastas and breads, trading them for whole wheat, and slowing down on sodas and sweets, your AIC will probably be fine next time. \n\nSalad, with raisins, cucumbers, pickled beets, shredded carrots, avocado, iceberg lettuce and baby spinach, and alfalfa sprouts. Add a bit of cheese and throw a handful of c\u0155umbled whole wheat crackers on top, and opt for whatever full fat salad dressing you like best. Salad is never a bad choice and it  keeps you fuller longer, esp if you add the crackers and the whole fat dressing.\n\n You need some saturated fat to feel satiated longer. You CAN drink a glass of whole milk (chocolate is okay, using syrup) at whatever meal you have where you tend to snack after having. The milk will keep you feeling more satiated and less likely to want to grab something sweet for instant energy. Just a warning, cows milk has a lot of carbs in it, so go easy and only drink this once or twice a day. If full fat cows milk is out of the question, try Almond Milk that is unsweetened, and add a teaspoon of buttermilk and mix it up, to add some fat. The whole point is to get some added saturated fat while avoiding high carbs, so try to get creative. \n\nSchedule a sweet treat. Schedule and plan ahead for it. I.e. if you want chocolate, set aside a quarter of a Hersheys bar. Wrap it up and have it planned for your dessert. Youre allowed to eat sugar. Just have to learn HOW. For a lot more reasons than diabetes anyways. \n\nBe aware of your fruit intake. 6 oz of juice is one serving of fruit. You shouldnt have more than 2 per day. Think of it as having 12 oz of fruit a day. A mango is close to two servings. Maybe a mango and about 5 or 6 grapes is two servings. Dont be drinking a ton of OJ in the morning. Too much sugar and way too many calories. Fruit doesnt do much for you, so its not something you need much of. \n\nFocus on your carbs being high fiber, your meats or beans being high protein, i.e. lean meats, lentils, etc,  and eating lots more of your favorite veggies. With veggies you just cant screw up any diet. Eat all you want of those bad boys. Go crazy on the veggies. \n\n\nFinally, diabetes is REALLY not your fault. You dont get it from being fat. You dont get it from being born imperfectly. Its just a thing, people end up getting. \n\n Sometimes there are other things going on, too, but having a low blood sugar can make you crave instant energy also. Plus your brain tells you that you need something sweet. So duh.  Its just that people get diabetes and thats all there is to it. You may be able to control your AIC, which is how much sugar you consume, but you might also not feel satiated or alert enough without sugars and carbs. So at the end of the day, its really a pretty complex issue to deal with. Dont feel guilty. You WILL most likely end up with diabetes. And if you dont, thats okay too. Lol you can only control SO much, is all I am saying. When your pancreas stops producing insulin, its just going to be a diabetes kind of life. You may want to keep some little packages of gummy bears or something that is fat free you can snack on when/if  you ever feel woozy. \n\nFYI I have occassionally had a semi-high borderline AIC since I was a kid, and have had extensive testing. I AM insulin resistant sometimes, and have heard plenty of times I am \"pre diabetic\" but the truth is, I just sometimes have high blood sugar. I do not have diabetes. Weird huh... Even as a kiddo. Lmao its complex. Dont take it personally. It is what it is. You may be the same way. Or you may ultimately be headed towards having a pancreas that doesnt produce insulin, and either way, the healthier and more balanced your diet is, the better off you will be.\n\nMeanwhile, ask to see an endocrinologist to make sure your AIC isnt a symptom of a smaller imbalance that you can treat more easily than diabetes.

I am an agnostic and I think that modern neuroscience and physics has pretty much disproven the idea of souls and the afterlife, but I could always be wrong and maybe we humans are just unable to detect souls for whatever reason.\n\nI have to admit the concept of nonexistence is pretty hard for me to grasp. I know people always say \"it will be just like before you were born\" which is probably true but that does not take into account what it is like to have something and then lose it. The idea of losing consciousness forever after having it for most of my life and experiencing nothing, not even blackness or emptiness, is pretty mind-boggling for me.\n\nLiterally its impossible to imagine nothingness because whatever you try to imagine will be SOMETHING the act of imagining itself is something.",

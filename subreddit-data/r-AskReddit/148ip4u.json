I\u2019ve been losing weight and I\u2019m finally in the healthy range, yet still above my goal. What would be considered my \u201cstandard weight\u201d is 25 lbs less than what I\u2019m at right now, and I\u2019m aiming to lose 12 more, so I\u2019m noticing more and more each 5 lbs difference there is. I\u2019ve lost 60 lbs since February of last year (had a 5 month break where I gained 10, but I\u2019ve lost 6 again so far), and I have noticed the most difference in the last 10 pounds. My boobs are so damn light now, it feels so weird. And I can\u2019t put my hands on my hips as easily, nor rest my elbows on them, and my thighs don\u2019t rub together as much anymore. It feels great, but it\u2019s going to be even stranger when my face changes even more and my ring size goes down. All stuff I forgot about when they first changed because of how quickly it happened and how long it\u2019s been since it did.\n\nI went from 221 to 158 in 9 months, and I\u2019m 4 lbs from 158 again after gaining 10 lbs in 5 months, so I can lose 8 more lbs after that and be within 14 lbs of my standard weight, and I kind of feel comfortable with that for now. I\u2019m almost scared to weight as little as I did before because I also had no muscle and I was very inactive, but I know that\u2019s irrational because I\u2019m so much more active now and I work out too. I just still suffer from the same chronic illness and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll lose my muscles some day and look gaunt. I know my fat distribution is different than what it was 10 years ago though, so I know I won\u2019t neccesarily look the same, but it still doesn\u2019t stop me from worrying. At least I know that I won\u2019t have a problem with losing too much fat/muscle so I won\u2019t be underweight again. Worst I can do is have to bulk up every so often for the muscle lol",

And doctors don't believe you when you say you feel sick because on paper there are no numbers to blame for that.\n\nThe flip side of fat people being told to lose weight for every medical complaint is that thin people get told they are healthy because their stats fit in that 'healthy' box.\n\nIt's all anxiety",

Verbal abuse is a huge problem along with people grabbing your arms and saying \u201clook how thin your arms are\u201d or they point at your stomach or lift your shirt up enough to see your stomach and they point out that they think you need to eat more or work out more. Its uncomfortable to sit or lay on harder surfaces bc it just feels like you are laying on your bones. Its hard to find clothes that fit right(Ex. Pants that fit your thighs but fall down because there is so much extra fabric at your waist, and if you are wearing something with a belt its hard to have to adjusted to the right place where it will keeps your pants from sagging but also not create indents in your hip bones which can hurt a lot and bruise if you wear it all day) swimsuits are also a huge problem because its hard to find bottoms that don\u2019t have \u201cair holes\u201d on the right and left side of the center of your stomach where it meets your hip bone. I was in multiple sports in high school which included weights at practice and i eat everything. So eating enough and and trying to gain muscle wasn\u2019t fixing it. I love to eat so much and enjoy snacking all day when i can and never gain weight. People see this as a perfect life when they don\u2019t realize that not everyone likes it. I have tried gaining weight and i always fail. I even went to the doctor to see if there were ways that they could help and they told me i was lucky to be my size. It makes you hate yourself for the fact that you are skinny when everyone idolizes you for something you hate about yourself. It gets even worse when people think its okay for them to say \u201cyou have a nice *ass/b**bs for someone your size\u201d like that makes you feel good about yourself. A lot of females like to say \u201cenjoy being skinny now bc once you have kids your body will be ruined\u201d or \u201cjust wait till you get pregnant/older and your metabolism fails and then you will have stretch marks and hate yourself\u201d SKINNY people CAN have stretch marks too. I have them on my thighs from the the little muscle i did gain from highschool sports and i love them and have no problem gaining some if it happens to me in the future, but once you say that they give you a back handed compliment (Ex. Oh i wish i could love myself like you do but i could never do something so brave) and tell you that you will change your mind and your significant other won\u2019t like them either so you better have a good personality for when your body changes.",

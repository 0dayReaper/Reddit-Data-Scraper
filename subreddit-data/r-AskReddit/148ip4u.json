I was naturally very skinny.\n\nI had just finished running the seven-mile race at Living History when a dude at the finish line told me I need to start eating more.\n\nDude. I was in cross country. I ate ALL the time. I was eating so much I would put lots of people to shame. There is no limit to the amount of food a high school cross country team can go through!\n\nI had my shirt off (which if you\u2019ve ran at Living History you\u2019d know is an insane thing to do, that race is consistently freezing cold and snow-covered, running through creeks and snow drifts), and yeah, I probably looked pretty thin. But I was in great shape. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I was told I was too skinny, but come on, I was a long distance runner.",

You are just not used to eating a lot, like how fat people aren't used to eating a little. \n\n2500 calories spread over 3 meals is not a huge amount of food. Most restaurant entrees are over 1000 calories. \n\nCalories can be cheap too. I can make a 1000 calorie breakfast in about 10 minutes - eggs with cheese, toast with butter and jam, big glass of juice. \n\nAnd just because you're eating more doesn't mean you can't meal prep. Having a meal prep day for 7 days worth of 1000 calorie meals is basically the same amount of work as meal prepping 7 days of 500 calorie meals.\n\nYour post reads exactly like a fat person saying they can't lose weight because they don't have time to cook healthy or go to the gym.

Verbal abuse is a huge problem along with people grabbing your arms and saying \u201clook how thin your arms are\u201d or they point at your stomach or lift your shirt up enough to see your stomach and they point out that they think you need to eat more or work out more. Its uncomfortable to sit or lay on harder surfaces bc it just feels like you are laying on your bones. Its hard to find clothes that fit right(Ex. Pants that fit your thighs but fall down because there is so much extra fabric at your waist, and if you are wearing something with a belt its hard to have to adjusted to the right place where it will keeps your pants from sagging but also not create indents in your hip bones which can hurt a lot and bruise if you wear it all day) swimsuits are also a huge problem because its hard to find bottoms that don\u2019t have \u201cair holes\u201d on the right and left side of the center of your stomach where it meets your hip bone. I was in multiple sports in high school which included weights at practice and i eat everything. So eating enough and and trying to gain muscle wasn\u2019t fixing it. I love to eat so much and enjoy snacking all day when i can and never gain weight. People see this as a perfect life when they don\u2019t realize that not everyone likes it. I have tried gaining weight and i always fail. I even went to the doctor to see if there were ways that they could help and they told me i was lucky to be my size. It makes you hate yourself for the fact that you are skinny when everyone idolizes you for something you hate about yourself. It gets even worse when people think its okay for them to say \u201cyou have a nice *ass/b**bs for someone your size\u201d like that makes you feel good about yourself. A lot of females like to say \u201cenjoy being skinny now bc once you have kids your body will be ruined\u201d or \u201cjust wait till you get pregnant/older and your metabolism fails and then you will have stretch marks and hate yourself\u201d SKINNY people CAN have stretch marks too. I have them on my thighs from the the little muscle i did gain from highschool sports and i love them and have no problem gaining some if it happens to me in the future, but once you say that they give you a back handed compliment (Ex. Oh i wish i could love myself like you do but i could never do something so brave) and tell you that you will change your mind and your significant other won\u2019t like them either so you better have a good personality for when your body changes.",

As a young adult, I ate healthy food. I didn't just eat \"whatever\" or junk food. But I really had to focus on proteins and healthy fats and cramming enough calories in to make sure my pants didn't start falling off of me. Portion control or set meal times were never on my radar. Now that I've both had a kid and entered middle age, breaking the habit of just eating all day or whenever food is in front of me seems impossible. I still look skinny-ish cuz I'm tall, but it's more fat than muscle these days and my energy levels have taken a real hit.",

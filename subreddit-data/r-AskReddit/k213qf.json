It's called islendingabok.is and basically it's a big family tree. Iceland can see who their ancestors are and who you are related to because we kept such good trace that we can see who are ancestors are all the way to back when we hadn't found Iceland. It's very fun to see how closely related you are to your friends. Oh and many also check it before hook ups just to make sure that you aren't doing incest XD If you are 5 generations apart you are fine. We don't see that as your relative. I am very lucky that I an 8 and 9 generations apart from my gf... then again it wouldn't matter as much since we are both girls... most of my friends are 7 generations away from me.\n\nOh and one thing I discovered with this is that I have a famous ancestor! She was famous for being kidnapped by pirates and turned into a slave but then she was able to get back home. Her name is Gu\u00f0r\u00fan  Tyrkjago\u00f0.",

You can look up yarn and find what others have made with it and what others have to say about it.  There is a great community and lots of groups for all kinds of topics.  There are always knowledgeable people able to help work out a problem or fix errors you may run into working on your projects.\n\nIt really is a great site.  Those who are a part of subs here on reddit like /r/knitting and /r/crochet are likely already very familiar with ravelry.  However it isnt well known outside of those groups I've found.  Anyone who likes to stitch or knows someone who likes to stirch should know about it as a great place of resources and inspiration.",

So, no, Christmas is very much still going on.",

Beautiful songs, more saffron buns and some gingerbread.\n\n&gt; Tradition has it that Lucia is to wear \u2018light in her hair\u2019, which in practice means a crown of electric candles in a wreath on her head. Each of her handmaidens carries a candle, too. Parents gather in the dark with their mobile cameras at the ready.\n\n&gt; The star boys, who like the handmaidens are dressed in white gowns, carry stars on sticks and have tall paper cones on their heads. The Christmas elves bring up the rear, carrying small lanterns.\n\nYeah, we're odd. But we like it.\n\nAnd then it's Christmas. To each, their own, I guess.\n\nIn my family, we get's a Christmas stocking filled with wooden puzzles, and spend the morning... actually being bored :) We wrap the last gifts, solves the puzzles and enjoy each other's company. Around noon, we eat some [traditional Swedish Christmas food](https://blogs.studyinsweden.se/2018/12/31/what-is-swedish-julbord/), and at two it's time for tea and cookies as well as having someone read the Annunciation to the shepherds (although we're fairly traditional, most probably don't).\n\nAt three, Swedes have a tradition to all watch [Donald Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_All_of_Us_to_All_of_You) (although it's less so nowadays) and [Christopher's Christmas Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagan_om_Karl-Bertil_Jonssons_julafton) before we start opening our gifts - one at a time and with Christmas rhymes to each.\n\nThis takes a while, so we take a break around eight to eat more Christmas food. With a mum from Norway, it's more shellfish and salmon than traditional Swedish food this time around, but it's tradition for my family. After that pause, we continue to open gifts, often finishing late in the night with some tea and left-overs.\n\nOn Christmas Day, we keep enjoying each other's company, until the evening when you meet your friends and go to a Christmas party, and on Boxing Day it's time to meet the relatives (or those relatives you actually enjoy hanging out with). As my family is somewhat large, my parents' house have been the natural gathering ground for those of my cousins that we don't dislike :)\n\nNothing special really happens for the twelve days of Christmas. Yes, we celebrate New Year's Eve, but that's... somewhat separate. We still head over to each other's houses, eat some leftovers or drink some mulled wine, but it's nothing set in stone. We do as we please, more or less.\n\nOn the 3 Kings Day, we used to eat a large family dinner at my grandmother's house, but no one took on that tradition once she passed some twenty years ago. Instead, we wait another week before \"twentieth day Knut\", where we celebrate the murder of a Danish duke by ending Christmas, robbing the spruce and eating candy. It's also when we're supposed to pack the last remains of Christmas decorations, although... they're kinda nice to keep up, so that tend to ber delayed some more days.\n\nI've probably forgotten a gazillion minor traditions along the way... but yeah, that's Christmas for me, and you're right, it's crazy cozy when everyone participates.",

And it's not so much that you have to do certain things or be in a certain way, but just... to slow things down and be... merry.\n\nTo be perfectly fair, it might also have something to do with how we treat relations, combined with Sweden being an old country far up in the cold and dark north. Outsiders tend to say that it's hard to become friends with Swedes, but once you've got to know some of us, it's something special. We stick together, as we've always have had to, or we freeze to death. Which includes the darkest days of the year such as Christmas, as well as how we light it up with adventsljusstakar and stars :)",

It's really just a very tiny detail, because before the Gregorian calendar came along the 25th of December WAS the 6th of January (when we Orthodox people celebrate it). It was really just a move to be different from the Catholics when they adopted the Gregorian calendar. And the world, I might add. EDIT: meant the Seventh of January. Going Covid-crazy here.",

We don't live in Armenia but my family don't celebrate the 24th/25th. I don't like the idea of completely treating it as a normal day, though, considering the rest of the country celebrates something, but I also find it sad that for others Christmas is over on the 26th and they've already binned the tree when to me it's just the start of 12 days of on and off festivities.",

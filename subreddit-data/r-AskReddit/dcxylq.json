I don't see a good reason to be anywhere ever before 10am.\n\nI started forcing myself to wake up early and go to the gym before work. And i hate it so much but it makes me feel so goddam good all day long. It's a shitty healthy dose of morning endorphins that stops me from getting sleepy after lunch, keeps me energized after work, get a better night's sleep. \n\nIt sucks so much and it sucks even more that it improves every aspect of my day because now if i stop i know i'll just start having shitty bad days again and it'll be my dumbass lazy fault with a simple fix.",

I know it keeps you healthy but, god at what cost.\n\nWhenever I have had a gym membership I get signed up with a routine, but I always end up doing an hour on a treadmill until I'm tired, then use that as an excuse to go home. I have no upper body strength but at least I can run for a while.\n\nOn sunny days I slap on some jogging shoes and go to a local park that is also a bird sanctuary. I play Biologist. Pretending I'm discovering birds in their natural habitat and monologue to myself.\n\nI'm not out for a run, I'm playing biologist and it's different!\n\nGod I hate running.",

Hell no. Save *generously* for retirement. Keep an emergency fund. Safeguard your future.\n\nBut don\u2019t fuck up your present for a future that\u2019s not guaranteed either. That\u2019s just as bad a world view as the other way around, sacrificing part of your life for the sake of another part. But for some reason a lot of the financial subreddits *love* to advocate for it.\n\nI\u2019ve got extended family like this. Saved all their life and now... they just spend it st the casino and dumping cash in the collection plate at church, because they\u2019re too broken down to actually do anything with the money (be it self enrichment stuff or do charity work or whatever).\n\nAnother one I\u2019m reminded of is a guy who posted on /r/cars. He spent his whole life wanting a sportscar, and told himself he\u2019d get it when he retired. Guy finally retires, bus a 100k+ Porsche 911 S... and sells it a year later because it hurts too much to get in and out of, and it hurt his back to drive it (And Porsche\u2019s are some of the nicest/most gentle, most easy to live with sports cars out there). Should he have bought the 100k car in his 30s? No, but he could have probably found something fun and cheap to enjoy along the way.",

You don't have to outwit the fella if the fella is working with you because it's part of you anyway- This way you wouldn't feel too pressured and stressed because who knows, it might be too much for you and people have jumped off the bridge avoiding such things and it's not so much about avoiding but it's mostly from the energy you spent avoiding so and so",

I have spent over 12 years in therapy dealing with PTSD from their abuse and negligence.\n\nYou know what keeps me going? My therapist telling me I am the last stop. I am where the abuse ends. I am my family\u2019s \u201cagent of change\u201d. Looking back at my family history, there is generation after generation of abuse. That was always the case \u2014 until me.\n\nUp until people like us were born, no one in our family was strong enough to change. No one had the power or the courage to withstand the abuse and not become it. \n\nSo yes, you should definitely pat yourself on the back, and know that even on your worst day you are still NOT them. You\u2019re a fighter. You are the last stop. The abuse stops with you. You get to take what was meant to harm you and destroy you and completely alter the course of your family line. Sending you massive hugs of encouragement.\n\nEdit: Y'all. I did not expect this comment would even really be seen, so thank you internet friend for my first gold and thank you to everyone in the thread below for the kind comments! To use a really cliche quote: \"Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle\". Find opportunities to show kindness to others, but make sure you also find opportunities to show kindness to yourself.\n\n(also fixed some spelling mistakes)",

Let all your thoughts and feelings happen around it but let your focus be breathing in and out. I think most people would be surprised how much it helps. For me it's like I need those vices to distract me or make me feel good or even just as something to do cause I feel bored. But lately I've been just simply practicing breathing and I've realized how much those vices were just serving to compact those feelings tighter into me instead of lifting them off me. Just letting me brain even attempt to return to a state of calm has let other thoughts become much more prevalent than just serving the part of my mind that wants enjoyment. I guess I'm just describing meditation but when you say meditation some people take it as this complex practice of yoga and mantras n stuff but I just want to promote the importance of rhythmic breathing.",

My manageable moments are obviously filled with as much joy as I can pack in there, and every night before going to bed I tell the voice to suck it, today was my day, not yours.\n\nWhen it's unmanageable and the voice tells me to give up I try to fight him as long as I can, and when I start to agree with him I always manage to end it with \"but not today\".\n\nIt's kept me alive for this long, I hope I can keep going like this for awhile.",

I'm one semester short of a mechanical engineering degree, but early last year (before I knew about the bipolar) I was prescribed Lexapro and \"that guy\" took full control.  Walked out on the internship I'd worked at for a year and a half (with a full-time job waiting post-graduation), started smoking weed like a fiend, ended up on a year of probation for an eighth, dropped out, moved back home, got fired from several jobs,  and lost the woman I'd been with for 10 years and had planned to marry after graduation.  My emotions were so out of control that I kept contacting her for a couple months until she blocked me on everything.  My libido skyrocketed and my dick stopped working, pushing me into many reckless sexual encounters.  I was emotionally abusive to everyone around me.  \n\nI was a fucking scumbag.\n\nThat SSRI caused me to do, say, and think things that were so far out of character I didn't recognize myself.  It amplified my impulsiveness, caused full-fledged manic episodes, and made me suicidal when I'd never felt that way before.  Therapy did nothing to reign me in.  I finally stopped taking it in May of this year and switched to Wellbutrin and Lamotrigine.  Within days of stopping Lexapro I could feel my head turning back around.  Within a month the voice that had gotten me so far in school was starting to whisper in the back of my head, and the whisper has been growing stronger since.  I'm still trying to recover from the emotional havoc I caused for the people around me.  Got a new therapist who's been fantastic for me, and I'm starting an engineering-adjacent job on Monday.  I'm hoping to return to school next Fall.  Once I'm settled into the new job, my therapist has agreed to help me reach out to my ex-fiance, but I'm fairly certain that the damage I did was permanent.  \n\nThis isn't really related to your post other than the ADHD, but I'm on the tail end of the worst two years of my life and needed to vent.  Be careful combining psychotropics.",

            "comment": "Might get buried, but my dude in my head is literally Mr. Spock from Star Trek, and I don't avoid him.\n\nHear me out - I discovered through therapy that I needed a mechanism for judgement-less and objective self-analysis and Mr. Spock is that dude. He can see the most fucked up space shit ever and react calmly and objectively.\n\n\nMr. Spock: \"The massive space blob has a 97.454% chance of consuming the ship and everyone inside within 4/7 minutes. Projections show it will be slow and painful.\"\n\n\nKirk: \"That's horrible!\"\n\n\nSpock: \"Yes, it is not ideal for our continued survival, but it's actions are entirely within the nature of the space blob.\"\n\n\nSo, whenever I get spun up on something in my head I imagine a mini-Spock in my head with a science terminal that can pull all data about ME. \n\n\nme: \"Spock, science report.\"\n\n\nSpock: \"Data shows that godspeedmetal is 5.8 days from quitting smoking tobacco and is under great mental distress from the change of chemical intake. He isn't consciously aware of it, but he's attempting to make up an excuse to get gas on a half-tank in order to create an opportunity to buy a pack of cigarettes.\"\n\n\nme: \"Thank you, Spock, sounds like I'm being dishonest with myself. I suck!\"\n\n\nSpock: \"I disagree. It's entirely within the nature of a nicotine addict to seek out a source of nicotine intake. This is neither Good or Bad. Just natural. Data also suggests that conscious awareness mitigates the chances of nicotine intake by 89.45%. You've yet to procure a nicotine source as well. Commendable.\"\n\n\nJust going through that mental exercise will help knock me out of a mental spun-up state, help sort out emotions, feelings, all that stuff, into a parsed, objective, and most importantly, non-judgemental way.\n\nEDIT: holy shit, I'm happy this was received as well as it was. This mechanism has helped myself so much, however I'd offer a couple of words of advice if you are intending to take on this method as well because it can be a frustrating mechanism to employ if you don't have your expectations set correctly. \n\nOne - Spock's reports WILL be amended, appended, referenced and reworked entirely. This is all part of the process. Even Spock had several times where extended analysis was needed to understand something in order to create a way to cope/overcome/whathaveyou. Don't treat everything he says as immutable truth - his analysis is only as good as the data he is able to receive through that mental science terminal. Your initial reports will upgrade that terminal for stronger analysis in the future.\n\nTwo - You WILL fail, as well, and that's totally OK! He's analyzed far more for me than just smoking - everything from anxiety, struggles with work, and interpersonal relationships has been reviewed through that science terminal. But sticking with the smoking report as an example - recognizing that \"getting gas\" was just an excuse to get cigarettes didn't come from a single analysis, but was referenced from a prior \"science report\", as at one point I had quit smoking, went to get gas a few days later and drove away with a pack of cigs in my pocket. Spock reported, \"godspeedmetal formulated a reason to create an environment that allowed his weakened will to procure a source of nicotine. Further analysis shows that nicotine addiction is extremely subversive to godspeedmetal's psyche at a subconscious level. The strength of control the addiction exerts upon his mind is quite strong. *Fascinating.*\" Spock doesn't judge me - it all is what it is - and I respond, \"That IS fascinating! My mind is stranger than I ever thought possible. However, I am more in control because I now recognize this pattern of behavior. I believe that this can be identified at a later point if I do this again. Thank you, Spock.\" That failure to stop smoking at that time was an opportunity to learn about myself. And FYI - I'm several months smoke free and still going!\n\nThree - this isn't to make someone an emotionless logic machine, either - Spock understands human nature is an emotional experience. Humans get horny, sad, happy, angry, depressed, excited - all of that stuff that comprises the human condition - it's all part of the Logic of Being Human. Take that into account, yet strive to be aware of your humanity and make conscious decisions on what you do instead of sub-consciously reacting emotionally.\n\nFour - trust your intuition. Your instincts have been developed over millions of years of evolution. Your mind is *powerful* and can sub-consciously recognize threats and boons to your world and yourself. Even if you don't understand *why* your guts are reacting they way they are, don't dismiss it. Run it by Spock and if you don't come to a satisfactory answer, you can always revisit later when you've more experience, time, and data.",

I can't believe someone else does the same thing.\n\nWhen I was a freshman in high school, I was having a lot of difficulty managing anger and other intense emotions. Then I went to go see Star Trek 2009 in theaters, and Spock's father said this line that stuck with me ever since: \"Emotions run deep within our race. In many ways more deeply than in humans. Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience. The control of feelings so that they do not control you.\" The movie showed young Spock's struggle with his human emotions, but obviously he overall manages it in a way that leaves him logical.\n\nEver since then, whenever I felt like I was getting overwhelmed with emotion, I would imagine two things: 1) I'm a Vulcan (lol I know this is lame, but it gives me a reason for why I'm feeling the emotion so strongly) 2) a little Mr. Spock in my head telling me \"Do not be controlled by your feelings. You are a Vulcan. Logic is the path.\"\n\nReal neat that we both use Spock for our mental health :)",

When you decide to make your own reasons to go on, its not to fool yourself, its deciding for yourself that no one or nothing else is going to give you a reason to live... so if you want one, you better figure it out for yourself.\n\nI struggled a lot with this when I was younger (my 20s basically) and would say a lot of things like what you\u2019ve said here. But I decided that those great days and times you mentioned are enough to hang through the shitty times, or that maybe one day I\u2019d even have a family of my own, or a great career. And as of about 4 months ago, I do have ALL of those things and I couldn\u2019t be more happy that I decided to stick around. \n\nSo yeah, I made my reasons up. But we all did. And they\u2019re all valid reasons.",

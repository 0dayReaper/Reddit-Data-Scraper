            "comment": "Not a trash collector, but I did an apprenticeship for heavy duty mechanics decades ago for a major city. Broken down trash trucks would get towed in sometimes with their load still in them. And sometimes you would have to crawl under them to replace parts to get the compactor or the lift cylinder working again. Or maybe it was the transmission. But if it had a load of trash, it was always dripping this obnoxiously odored, black viscous liquid from the trash hopper which the mechanics affectionately nicknamed \u201cthe juice.\u201d If you got it on you, you were stinking for the rest of the day. And if you had to work under the truck, it was almost inevitable. Guess who got to work under the trucks? The apprentices. Anyway, I lasted on that job for about a year before I decided to try something else.",

He went inside and I decided to sit in my car for a minute, 30 seconds later he came out and asked if I had instagram. We exchanged that and hung out. He then introduced me to his friends. I am now engaged to someone he introduced me to and we\u2019ve been living together for over a year and are very happy together. Those 30 second of waiting changed my life.",

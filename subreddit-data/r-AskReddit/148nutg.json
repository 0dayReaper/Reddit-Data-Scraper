I knew them both just a little bit. I considered them about equally attractive. Choosing randomly, I turned *to the right* and asked the girl to dance. She said yes. We danced all night. I thought it was the start of something long term, but it turned out that to her I was just a one night dance partner. The end.\n\nThe months went by. High school ended and I never saw either of those girls again. Later I learned that the girl on my left had had a huge crush on me.\n\nThat was years ago. Im now happily married with kids. I would not trade my family for anything. But still, sometimes I wonder: *what if I had turned to the left?*",

He went inside and I decided to sit in my car for a minute, 30 seconds later he came out and asked if I had instagram. We exchanged that and hung out. He then introduced me to his friends. I am now engaged to someone he introduced me to and we\u2019ve been living together for over a year and are very happy together. Those 30 second of waiting changed my life.",

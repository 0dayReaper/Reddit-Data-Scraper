            "comment": "I went car camping with my 6yo on a private camp ground last year. I have camped a million times, but this was the first time I had taken her by myself.\n\nThat night we settled in after a good day on the river. The moon was nearly full and you could see so clearly. There was no need for a flashlight and we were in a pretty open clearing.\n\nShe fell asleep almost instantly, but for some reason I was extremely on edge and couldn't sleep. I felt like something was watching us, but I chalked it up to being alone with my small child.\n\nAfter a few hours of struggling to calm my nerves, she wakes up needing to use the bathroom. Now, I'm thinking I really do not want to get out of this car, but I put my brave face on and we step out of the SUV.\n\nShe was totally fine, but as soon as we step into the moonlight this child screams at the TOP of her lungs \"WHAT IS THAT?!!?\" while literally crawling up onto my back.\n\nThe sense of dread hit me and I'm looking all around not seeing a damn thing. I'm asking \"Where? What do you see? I'm not seeing it.\" trying to keep her calm but shes screaming \"RIGHT THERE! WHAT IS THAT??!! RIGHT THERE!!!!\" as if its directly in front of us and I'm blind.\n\nI scoop her up and run to the safety of the bathrooms, because I truly believe she saw something I couldn't see. My heart is racing and I'm asking what she saw. She keeps saying she doesn't know what it was and can't describe it to me. We do our business and I look out not seeing anything.\n\nI pick her up and get us back to the car where she immediately falls back asleep and I do not get a wink until morning.\n\nNeedless to say, we did not stay another night but it was hands down the most scary experience I've had camping.\n\nI don't know what she saw, but I had never seen her react like that to ANYTHING.\n\nTLDR: Go camping and my kid freaks out because she sees something terrifying in the moonlight that I apparently can't see after feeling like something watching us sleep.",

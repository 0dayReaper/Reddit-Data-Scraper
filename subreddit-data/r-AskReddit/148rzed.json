            "comment": "Barcelona. Weather, football club and culture aside, it's just a very aesthetically pleasing place.  \n\nYou get pretty wide, open avenues like the Av. Diagonal, nice pedestrian ways like La Rambla, pretty calm and green areas like l'Eixample (despite being bang in the middle of the city; the layout helps prevent congestion), Napoli-esque tight streets in La Barceloneta with lots of great eateries, steeper Lisbon-esque streets in areas like Gracia, and a nice balance of architecture all around.  \n\nA bit of both of Paris and Seville, with just enough Catalan Modernist architecture by Gaudi &amp; co. to add something unique without being overwhelming. All pretty traditional, no dystopian modern-looking horrors, and what's modern is usually in good taste.  \n\nAlso pretty clean by default; the street cleaning services can get overwhelmed during tourist season, but if you're there in April or October then it's very neat.",

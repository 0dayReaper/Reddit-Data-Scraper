Your retail job is safe.\n\nBangalore may not be taking US retail jobs, but I assure you, those retail jobs are not safe.\n\nIn Alameda, CA, my Bank of America branch is a little bit unusual. The receptionists are flat screens (with cameras and two-way audio). There is one on each side of the building next to each door. There are also three meeting rooms. If you swipe your card and open one of those meeting room doors. A real person pops up on the video screen and asks you what you need. She said she was located in Florida. The current minimum wage in Florida is $8.56 an hour. In Alameda, it's $13.50 an hour.\n\nIn addition to that, you have to factor in the fact that banking gets the most congested during certain hours of the day, so remote staff members could service the six different time zones of the United States much more efficiently than someone remaining inside every branch and staying idle during the rest of the time.\n\nAnd that's just one example of retail jobs disappearing. With Bank of America, the ATMs are also more advanced than they used to be. And when you need to deposit a check, you just need to take a picture of it with your phone without going to a branch or an ATM.\n\nIn Berkeley, CA, there are little ice cooler robots that make deliveries. People think that those are AI, but those are [remote-controlled](https://www.dailycal.org/2019/10/15/kiwi-hires-colombian-students-to-supervise-kiwibots/) from workers in Colombia. The minimum wage in Colombia is 908,526 pesos or around US$260 - per month. The minimum wage in Berkeley itself is $15.59 an hour.\n\nAnd then, we have retail establishments such as Amazon Go, Panera Bread, Walmart, Safeway, Lucky, Wholefoods, Target, Starbucks, McDonald, gas stations, etc.\n\nThese all vary in their level of automation and usability, but sometimes your only choice is to do your own self-checkout or your own ordering through your phone or through a kiosk if you want to skip the much longer lines with actual human employees.\n\nAnd I hate to say it, but with this pandemic, some automation actually makes a lot of sense. After all, you wouldn't want the person preparing your sandwich to be handling the cash, the data entered on the cash register, or to have too much face-to-face contact with each customer. And nowadays, virtual health consultations make a lot more sense than actually visiting a hospital or a doctor.\n\nAnd sometimes, there are some huge gains in efficiency and availability, like Lyft/Uber, like AirBnB, or like the California DMV kiosks, like the Amazon lockers, or like the 24 hr Keyme kiosks that can duplicate your house keys, back them up virtually (if you opt-in), and email them to someone on the other side of the country.\n\nAnd then, you have the smart parking meters that can collect donations for the homeless, or that will snitch on you and remotely call the meter maid when your meter just expired and your car is still there. Or you have the meter maids (in Berkeley) and their two cameras on their vehicle at 30-degree angles that will automatically scan the license plates on both sides of the streets at 20 miles an hour and that can print out a fully filled out parking ticket in two seconds.",

Viewers were able to send advice on whom they thought she should choose to give her kidney to via text messages. \n\nIt was revealed during the course of the show that the \"terminally ill\" woman was, in reality, an actress, although the three candidates were, in fact, real kidney patients; they were aware that Lisa was an actress, and participated because they were supportive of the cause to give awareness to the limited number of organ donors in the Netherlands.",

Working with you for the past week showed me how hard working and loyal of an employee you are, and it\u2019s because of employees like you that this company is able to succeed and pay for my 4 yachts. To show you how much I appreciate you and all of the other hard workers at (insert company here) Corp I\u2019m personally going to pay for a 3 day all inclusive trip to Busch gardens, and you\u2019ll be paid for your time off. You\u2019ve earned it buddy, you deserve this. For your daughter I\u2019m setting up a college account with 2,000 dollars, because I know you want to give her a bright future. I know that (insert company here) Corp doesn\u2019t offer health insurance, so for your daughters treatments I\u2019ll be setting aside an extra 1,000 dollars in a special savings account.\u201d *CEO sheds a tear and places hand on John\u2019s shoulder* \u201cWe value you John, you\u2019ve taught me so much.\u201d John tears up himself and hugs the generous CEO.\n\n\u201cKerry\u201d, the CEO says with a chuckle while wiping his eye. \u201cKerry, you really opened my eyes when you told me how (insert company here) Corp makes you work 17 hour shifts without a break and makes you pee in Gatorade bottles to keep up with deliveries. I am shocked and saddened that valued employees are being treated like this, so I\u2019ve decided to make a big change. As of today, I\u2019m instituting a policy that allows each and every employee an extra 10 minute bathroom break on shifts longer than 12 hours. In addition, we just added a brand new separate women\u2019s restroom!Kerry, you\u2019re the life blood of this company, and without employees like you we wouldn\u2019t be where we are today.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd for the rest of you..\u201d the CEO says to a crowd of smiling employees. \u201cYou\u2019ll each be receiving a FIFTY. DOLLAR. GIFT CARD to Outback Steakhouse along with your next paycheck!\u201d The crowd of employees clap and cheer, and generic soft rock without vocals plays in the background of the corporate event that caps off the CEO\u2019s week at work with the little guys. \n\nCamera zooms out and back in to show CEO at his summer home in the Hamptons wearing his usual suit and tie, but now with a clean shaven face and without the adhesive mustache that he was wearing as a disguise for the past week. \u201cThis week was a huge eye opener for me and taught me so much about the way we run (insert company here) Corp. I appreciate our employees on an entirely different level, and I\u2019m humbled by the dedication that our employees bring to work every single day. We\u2019re still making some changes to our policies to really give back to the employees who have given us so much. I learned a ton from this past week and I\u2019ll be forever grateful for the experience\u201d",

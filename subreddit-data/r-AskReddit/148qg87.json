Asuming i wore gloves all the time i could build it the best terranium on planet earth and give it all the food it wants. Man and snail, together forever .",

I'd calculate how near the snail will get and will then choose a place somewhere much further away.\n\nCould even switch between different properties in different places.\n\nMaybe I'd have an apartment in Sydney, an apartment in London, an apartment in Los Angeles, an apartment in New York and an apartment in Dubai, as a minimum.",

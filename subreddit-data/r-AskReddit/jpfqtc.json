The protagonist of the episode, the Doctor's current companion, goes back in time to the episode's divergent point and kills herself in an attempt to ensure that the Doctor lives and the timeline is corrected.\n\nIf I woke up on January 1st, 2020, I would aim to achieve Donna Noble's goal, preferably without dying, but hey.

Lay my head on his chest to hear his heartbeat everyday.\n\nHe died in May at age 31.\n\nI'd give anything to wake up tomorrow and see his bright blue eyes.\n\nEDIT: Oh my goodness, I wrote this at about 3am and then went to sleep, I had no idea it was cause this much attention. Thank you to everyone who has commented, sent me well wishes and love and thank you for all of the lovely awards. Not sure I deserve so much kindness but I sure as hell appreciate it. \n\nHe left our house walking, talking and smiling back at me as he got in to the ambulance and less than 24 hours later I felt his heart stop under my hand. He was already sedated when I arrived at the hospital so im not even sure he knew I was there but I pray he did. No one deserves to think they are dying alone.\n\nHe was the light of my life, my best friend and I miss him more than even I can comprehend.\n\nDon't sweat the small stuff, folks. In the end, it rarely ever matters.\n\nPeace and love to you all",

IT needed to upgrade the pc's firmware, and asked me to back up everything before giving it to them, since they would wipe the hdd...... i copied everything to dropbox, and once it copied only the subfolders, for some reason gave the green tick mark that means copying was done, so i didn't double check and just gave it to them...... i realized what happened later on, and by then they wiped the PC and turned the bits, so it was unrecoverable....... since my fiasco, IT enacted the policy that they will always backup the hdd of any PC before wiping it",

No computers, of course, but they did have carbon paper. So he always had a carbon copy of his diss, as did his friends. They would store their carbons in each other's refrigerators because that was the most fire-proof place in most people's houses. (We had a friend's diss in our fridge; he had my dad's in his.) \n\nWhen I was doing my diss in the early 90s, I had a computer to write it on. Every time I went to the building my department was in I took a floppy with the latest version stored on it, then put it in a locker I had there on the lowest floor. That building was an atom bomb shelter and built like a fortress. Anything that brought it down would be bad enough that losing my diss back-up would be the least of my worries. \n\nGlad to hear you were able to reconstruct the part that hadn't yet been published, but I get the loss you felt.",

Although perhaps the mask is a good idea, just in case any virus in you, comes back with you, mutating slightly over the thousands and millions of years until you &gt;!finally manage to love someone!&lt;\n\nEdit:  Guys, have you even looked at the Amazon stock price this year?  It barely doubled.  Whilst an excellent return in normal circumstances, it\u2019s an terrible gain for someone with knowledge of the future, just bet on a sports game you remember or something, you\u2019ll get more and won\u2019t have to wait 6 months.",

So I feel this.\n\nI pay my gas bill like this: I walk 30 minutes to the village over the hill. There I find a small office for JA's gas business. The little lady behind the counter (who knows me by name) then takes my paper bill. Tears things off it. Prints some more paper. Finds her \"cash draw\" key. Opens the draw and takes a nice little wooden rack of coins and notes out. She then gives me change. I thank her and walk home.\n\nEvery month.\n\nBut - there is a reason for staying with paper based systems that I have some sympathy with - it is just a lot harder to end up with things going missing or failing to trace where problems arise. I've had much less trouble than I did in the UK with that. In the UK huge numbers of post office workers lost their jobs and in many cases were jailed over a computer error. So I do think of that.\n\nBut now when I go to the konbini and get an Amazon delivery to pick up, I do not take away any paper. So things have improved.",

They're well known to patiently wait in line for anything. Back in my younger days I remember seeing picture differences in lines at an American anime convention vs a Japanese anime convention...the picture from the Japanese anime convention showed attendees in neat, orderly, single-filed lines even without those line barrier things and moving swiftly and fluidly whereas the picture from the American convention showed a convoluted mess even with the line barriers. When I went to Japan 4 years ago people waited in line for even the *elevator*, and they would actually wait for everyone on the elevator to get off before getting on, a concept that Americans have trouble getting. Same with busses and trains. \n\nAlso I'm Asian and I have always waited in lines without cutting anyone, the heck?\n\nEdit: An example of how Japanese people are super efficient at queueing: https://youtu.be/QwfZZG4Q_FE?t=130",

And they use a lot of similar language and ideas as China for their foreign policy stances.

The real problem is that China is more of peer that can't be bullied anymore - and India can be.\n\nI think that's important for people to note because they use the whole, \"human rights\" etc. to get the average persons support for their new military BS and cold wars.

More so than others. \n\nApparently because roughly 99.99% of citizens of the PRC never see a wild animal bigger than a rat, they don't understand the dangers of getting too close to them, especially the bison which are generally pretty mellow as long as you don't get too close to them. \n\nAlso, there is a major language barrier.   Very few (if any) park employees speak Mandarin, and many of the Chinese who visit on these package tours don't speak any English, or very little.  So trying to warn them is often an exercise in futility.",

An exam on a topic may involve 100 random multiple-choice questions from a pool of 500 questions. These questions are published / searchable on the internet. Rather read the textbook and learn the topic the strategy is to memorise the correct answer to 500 questions you do not understand. just remember the pair.",

There are a lot of people who fantasize about moving elsewhere, becoming someone else, and what not. They think the grass is greener, and for some people that will be the case.

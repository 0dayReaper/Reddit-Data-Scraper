I've had much less trouble than I did in the UK with that. In the UK huge numbers of post office workers lost their jobs and in many cases were jailed over a computer error. So I do think of that.\n\nBut now when I go to the konbini and get an Amazon delivery to pick up, I do not take away any paper. So things have improved.",

They barely understand Chinese culture outside of their immediate surroundings, they certainly have no concept of the cultures they're traveling to. But it's funny, because I recently saw a post on here from an English guy who traveled to the US, asked for a sandwich to be buttered, and was complaining that they didn't somehow know to do it the way they did it in England. So cultural awareness is hard for everyone.",

They're well known to patiently wait in line for anything. Back in my younger days I remember seeing picture differences in lines at an American anime convention vs a Japanese anime convention...the picture from the Japanese anime convention showed attendees in neat, orderly, single-filed lines even without those line barrier things and moving swiftly and fluidly whereas the picture from the American convention showed a convoluted mess even with the line barriers. When I went to Japan 4 years ago people waited in line for even the *elevator*, and they would actually wait for everyone on the elevator to get off before getting on. \n\nAlso I'm Asian and I have always waited in lines without cutting anyone, the heck?\n\nEdit: An example of how Japanese people are super efficient at queueing: https://youtu.be/QwfZZG4Q_FE?t=130",

I\u2019ve never met anyone like that in real life and many people don\u2019t even know that buraku used to exist nowadays though.\n\nThe word buraku is censored on TV so I guess when you say it\u2019s a taboo, that\u2019s true in a way. But we do learn about it in school throughout all school years from primary to high school. We were taught that the discrimination did exist and affected many people and we should never forget about it. And that we should never repeat the same history. \n\nI found out that my dad\u2019s side is actually from buraku (so I guess that makes me I am too?) when I was in my late 20s. I was googling about my grandparents\u2019 town out of boredom one day and I came across the website which was run by I guess one of those people with prejudice. There was a list of towns and last names allegedly associated with buraku, and both my last name and my grandparents\u2019 town were listed. So I asked my dad about it out of curiosity and it totally freaked him out. He denied it at first but he did tell me the truth later. He said he lied at first because he thought it ruined my marriage (which is my fault because I asked him about it on our way to meet my now husband\u2019s parents for the first time lol.)\nHe told me not to tell anybody about this. So I\u2019m guessing the discrimination is still very much real thing for him.\n\nThis is actually my first time talking about this to anybody. It\u2019s kinda nice to be able to get it off my chest.",

More so than others. \n\nApparently because roughly 99.99% of citizens of the PRC never see a wild animal bigger than a rat, they don't understand the dangers of getting too close to them, especially the bison which are generally pretty mellow as long as you don't get too close to them. \n\nAlso, there is a major language barrier.   Very few (if any) park employees speak Mandarin, and many of the Chinese who visit on these package tours don't speak any English, or very little.

I've met a few that were exceptions to the rule, they were welcomed with open arms and most of them even ended up finding a partner and staying here, as a fully integrated member of society. Perhaps it has gotten better over the last few years, but when I was in Uni I found it quite aggravating that most Asian students had a horrible time here due to isolation but also refused to do anything that could improve their situation.",

Math lectures are focused on understanding the underlying mechanics of the phenomenom, not just memorizing a bunch of steps.

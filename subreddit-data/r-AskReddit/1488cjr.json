They barely understand Chinese culture outside of their immediate surroundings, they certainly have no concept of the cultures they're traveling to. But it's funny, because I recently saw a post on here from an English guy who traveled to the US, asked for a sandwich to be buttered, and was complaining that they didn't somehow know to do it the way they did it in England. So cultural awareness is hard for everyone.",

They're well known to patiently wait in line for anything. Back in my younger days I remember seeing picture differences in lines at an American anime convention vs a Japanese anime convention...the picture from the Japanese anime convention showed attendees in neat, orderly, single-filed lines even without those line barrier things and moving swiftly and fluidly whereas the picture from the American convention showed a convoluted mess even with the line barriers. When I went to Japan 4 years ago people waited in line for even the *elevator*, and they would actually wait for everyone on the elevator to get off before getting on, a concept that Americans have trouble getting. Same with busses and trains. \n\nAlso I'm Asian and I have always waited in lines without cutting anyone, the heck?\n\nEdit: An example of how Japanese people are super efficient at queueing: https://youtu.be/QwfZZG4Q_FE?t=130",

But every international trip I've taken in the past 10 years or so has been marred by Chinese tourists that just don't understand how to act.  Most recently was in Japan.  Without knowing either language (but you can usually make out Japanese versus Chinese if you listen closely) I could immediately tell if we were near a group of Chinese tourists because they act the opposite of Japanese people.  Where the Japanese are generally reserved and respectful, Chinese tourists were consistently yelling, unmasked and oblivious to other people in public.\n\n...That being said, almost every other American we ran into in Japan was unmasked too.  I felt bad because they were still clearly emphasizing that everyone wear masks.  We tried to set a good example but we were outnumbered.\n\nA few years ago in Paris I was in the Louvre and watched Chinese tourists set off alarms every few minutes because they'd cross the barriers to try and touch the paintings.  Like, what did you think those velvet ropes were there for?",

The little lady behind the counter (who knows me by name) then takes my paper bill. Tears things off it. Prints some more paper. Finds her \"cash draw\" key. Opens the draw and takes a nice little wooden rack of coins and notes out. She then gives me change. I thank her and walk home.\n\nEvery month.\n\nBut - there is a reason for staying with paper based systems that I have some sympathy with - it is just a lot harder to end up with things going missing or failing to trace where problems arise. I've had much less trouble than I did in the UK with that. In the UK huge numbers of post office workers lost their jobs and in many cases were jailed over a computer error. So I do think of that.\n\nBut now when I go to the konbini and get an Amazon delivery to pick up, I do not take away any paper. So things have improved.",

And they use a lot of similar language and ideas as China for their foreign policy stances. Like refusing to say Russia is wrong for example.\n\nThe only real difference is India is much more willing to submit to the West for various than China or other countries in the region. The real problem is that China is more of peer that can't be bullied anymore - and India can be.\n\nI think that's important for people to note because they use the whole, \"human rights\" etc. to get the average persons support for their new military BS and cold wars.

They have a problem with the Chinese tourists getting too close to the wildlife there also.   More so than others. \n\nApparently because roughly 99.99% of citizens of the PRC never see a wild animal bigger than a rat, they don't understand the dangers of getting too close to them, especially the bison which are generally pretty mellow as long as you don't get too close to them. \n\nAlso, there is a major language barrier.   Very few (if any) park employees speak Mandarin, and many of the Chinese who visit on these package tours don't speak any English, or very little.  So trying to warn them is often an exercise in futility.",

A couple of tough looking dudes, but everyone pretty much just left me alone. I was a scrawny looking 17 y/o nerd. \n\nThey let me out Monday morning, 3/10 wouldn't recommend.",

Got pulled over dropping one of them off at home. All of us had weed and when we got pulled over we panicked and all sat on our bags. The cop took all our ids and said they were breaking curfew. We told him we thought since we were over 18 we thought they'd be our responsibility. Apparently that wasn't the case. He said he COULD take them in for breaking curfew. But he decided that because he knew one of their dads he was just gonna let us off with a warning. We were pulled over for a broken headlight. Had any of us been asked to get out we would've been fucked.",

            "comment": "In my younger days I was rather naughty... For about a year when I was 19/20, I was a drug dealer. One night me and a couple friends are driving around town, it's around 3 am. We're basically just hanging out, not doing anything to attract attention, just having a laugh, listening to music, neither of us were even high. But it attracted the attention of the police, who pulled us over. I am in full panic mode... I've got speed, coke, acid, hash and E on me, enough that if I get caught, I'm definitely going to prison. I start hiding it under the seat cushion, but my mate whose car it was (understandably) went ballistic, saying he's not going down for my mistake, so I just have to accept fate. The two police officers approach the car, and I can feel my heart about to beat its way out of my chest. Officer one asks for our names, which we all give, me last. Suddenly, officer two bends down and shines a flashlight straight in my face, \"Plankmeister? Ha! I know you! I haven't seen you for years, last time I saw you, you were little lad!\" Turns out it's a friend of the family. We have a bit of smalltalk for a few minutes about each our families, and he asks what we're doing out so late. I reply that I'm getting a lift home and that I should have been home an hour ago and my mum will be pissed... Officer two turns to officer one and says \"He's a great lad, this one, he's definitely not up to no good, alright lads, have a good night, off you go!\" And we drive off. We're discreetly glued to the mirrors to see if they follow us, but they don't. We take a few lefts and rights to make sure they're not following us, and then all 3 of us just bellow with excitement and adrenaline, laughing our asses off, literally can't believe it. I can't know the circumstances of why it was specifically officer two that was on duty that night, but I am very thankful he was, otherwise my life would 100% have looked very, very different.",

Even though I am introverted and feel comfortable spending time with myself, lately, it has been so lonely. Sometimes I just cry at night. The obvious solution would be to just \u201cgo out there\u201d, just to get to know new people and to reach out to people but I don\u2019t have any energy left for the social carousel. I\u2019ve been there, plenty of times and only made superficial acquaintances. Not having similar values or interests or when we do, people already having a busy social life and not leaving space for our friendship to develop\u2026or people moving away. There are so many hurdles. Sometimes, I don\u2019t know where these external circumstances stop and where my social incompetence begins, I just know that it is frustrating to constantly feel lonely.",

Unfortunately (if you work in office) facetime counts as much as the work you produce.

Don\u2019t complain or be a difficult to manage employee. Just go with the flow. Come bonus and raise time, your boss will have an easier time voting in your favor (or you will have an easier time making a good case for yourself)!\n\nWith all that said, don\u2019t be a pushover or let people take advantage of you.",

Just 1 month after getting hired just your regular staff guy, they gave me the option of manning a little side store, on the 2nd floor of the mall. I said sure. 1 month after that, I was given the option to Close the store, and actively count register money, make sure everything is secure, etc etc.\n\nnot even 2 weeks after that, they tell me \" hey, do you think you are able to come to work  at this store,then on your lunch break, drive to this OTHER store to close?\" I said yes... and then few weeks later was offered to man a small store Somewhere ELSE.... lol I had keys to 3 different stores.... this last one it was open/close. Alone. xD\n\nDo you see something missing from all that? That's right, in no part while I kept saying \"yes\" they offered more money in my paycheck, not even the fuel I was using to drive from store to store when I had to do that. Until I finally told them, \"I should be getting paid more, Im literally doing manager/assistance manager stuff, or if there was no raise, then I didn't want all that responsibility\"... Obviously they decided to just give me my old position back and no more store keys LOL.",

                    "comment": "The math has been done that shows Reddit is asking these apps to pay 10-20x what they themselves earn per user. The most generous possible numbers were used, well above industry estimates, as Reddit is still a private company and doesn\u2019t have to release earnings regularly. Even if half of all users currently use these apps, and currently aren\u2019t generating any revenue, the numbers don\u2019t add up.\n\n\nThe variance in those numbers is because it\u2019s not just Apollo, Reddit is Fun is an android competitor and there are dozens of other clients on desktop and mobile. It will also break many, many tools that mods use to do their jobs. Tools that only exist because reddit has broken promises they\u2019ve made over and over about introducing first-party alternatives. The offical mobile apps also don\u2019t work with screen readers, making them completely inaccessible for blind users.\n\n\nAs well, no one has been arguing that reddit shouldn\u2019t be allowed to introduce charges for their API. The Apollo dev has stated publicly that he wants them to charge for the API. He believes that it\u2019s important for their sustainability. But reddit is asking him $12,000 per 50m API calls and imgur charges him $166 for the same amount. \n\n\nThere\u2019s also the timeframe that was given between the pricing being revealed and the cutoff date, only 30 days. That\u2019s a really fast turnaround time for a change this large. The Apollo dev has stated if they cut the cost in half and give him just 90 days instead, he would be able to keep his app operating.",

Yes, delete them.  Delete your years' worth of karma and comment history and cake day counters and your special sentimental username.\n\nDelete the subs.  Don't black them out - *shut them down.*  You're going to lose your carefully-cultivated positions on the mod hierarchy and your famous subreddit name?  So what?  DELETE if you want to set Reddit straight.  Subs promising to return in a couple of days or at some unspecified future date makes Reddit corporate laugh.  People saying, \"I'll be back once you smarten up\" makes Reddit corporate laugh.  \n\nDelete.  But... of course, that's too much, isn't it.  To throw out your account or the sub you moderate.  Even though new accounts could be made on a straightened-out Reddit, or replacement subs created down the road under the same circumstances.\n\nTake the real action if you care so much, like I'm about to do.  A blackout is hardly less complacent than doing nothing under false pretences of neutrality.  \n\n- Posted by now-deleted account, /u/Suspenders_Johnson",

As for Reddit charging for the API, how could you not expect that? As for the opinion that it's overwhelming, it's hard for me to take 1 persons word on that. It would be great to see what similar markets look like, but, this seems like the wild west.

I asked one moderator to post a poll.  He refused.  He moderates close to 30 subs.  He ran a poll in one of them and made the decision for the rest.\n\nI also suggested that if this is intended to show reddit management how important those tools are to them, then it would make more sense to leave the sub open and simply not moderate it for two days so people can see what it looks like.  Nope.  His way or the highway.\n\nYou can't say you're doing it for the community when you reject highly rational opportunities that support the protest without doing it at the expense of the community.\n\nI could care less about the API stuff.

But I want to ask what people predict will actually happen in the next few days. Some subs and users are already picking up and leaving for good. Some subs are not participating.\n\nIs management going to back down eventually, even if it takes further blackouts? If they don't, is the site going to suffer a mass exodus and never recover? Will it just blow over on its own? Or will management force the closed subs back open and manage to carry on somehow with a skeleton crew?\n\nIt really feels different than previous Reddit controversies. Longtime users are talking more seriously about walking away forever. Management comes across as more determined or desperate enough to force the issue. But maybe their IPO business model can survive the pivot? It's all hard to predict.",

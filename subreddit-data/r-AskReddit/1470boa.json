    "postText": "Please use this post to discuss and/or ask questions regarding the blackout that many subreddits are currently participating in. This includes anything related to why the blackout is happening. All posts about this and related topics will be redirected to this thread.\n\nBeing one of the largest communities on Reddit, we've had a ton of conversation about whether or not to keep the sub open and what our point of view is. Ultimately, we were led back to our core subreddit value of offering a neutral place to discuss topics that can be complex, challenging, and sometimes uncomfortable.\n\nWe've always done our best to be a neutral mod team because this subreddit is about letting the community discuss topics and at this moment in time, the community speaks louder than mods do. The mods here individually have our own opinions on the Reddit API controversy but as mods of a community dedicated to conversations, we think it's more impactful to keep the subreddit open so people can discuss this controversial change and the surrounding impacts.\n\nWe also want this thread to be a place of respectful discourse. Remember the human. Respect that other people can have different opinions. Please share your points of views and have open minded conversations with others. If you feel like you can't be respectful toward another user, consider not posting it.\n\n**For information on what exactly is going on:**\n\n[**BBC: Reddit blackout: Subreddits to go private on Monday**](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65855608)\n\nEdit: spelling, added link to the BBC article",

            "comment": "I'm developing a theory that \"the blackout\" has MANY parallels to a labor union going on strike.\n\nTwo conclusions can be immediately jumped toward; how valid they are remains to be seen:\n\n* In labor relations, NEITHER SIDE actually has a Silver Bullet; neither side has a final action which brings the other to its knees.  \n * But, I don't think it's much of an overgeneralization to say, most strikers don't realize that.  They think, \"We walk out, they're done for\", which is rarely the case.\n* Second, going on strike is shooting their Last Bullet -- they've got nothing left, nothing to threaten, no further sanctions to impose.\n * SO, in case the strike doesn't work, **What's your Plan B**?  There usually isn't one.  And I think the same applies here: if the blackout doesn't have its desired effect, **Then What?**\n\nCorporate Reddit has had a week or 10 days to plan and prepare for this widely-announced action, and has obviously decided to gamble that the blackout will flop -- that they can in fact \"limp along\" for a while.  **What if they're right?**  -They- clearly have a contingency plan.  Do -we-?  Or are we working under the assumption that \"We walk out, they're done for\"?",

Like, is there a way to check on Reddit\u2019s response to it?\n\nIt's a two-day blackout, so you know for sure that after two days there will be some kind of update on reactions and next moves available back on Reddit. There will probably be some coverage from outside as well depending on how big or small of an impact it has.\n\nI wouldn't expect Reddit's management to cave after such a short time, but the idea isn't to put maximum pressure on them all at once. If they start to waver, the protest will have a reason to stand its ground and keep pushing. If they fight back by taking over the bigger subs, the protest will have a reason to start quitting the site entirely. There could be a mass exodus all at once, the site could slowly bleed to death, or the management might get what it wants and keep going in its new direction.\n\nIt should be obvious before too long whether the protest movement is strong enough to shake things up permanently. It might take longer to know who will remain standing at the end.",

People are sharing an unearned sense of accomplishment via slacktivism by preventing use of the site for the majority for whom these changes are about as far down the list of things to care about as changes can get. The rhetoric surrounding this has been unhinged at best, with users, moderators, and reddit staff being harassed relentlessly and abhorrent comments being made by supporters of this \"blackout\". This is yet another instance of the mob mentality of reddit perpetuated by people who if they put half the energy into things that mattered and were of actual importance, could possibly make an improvement to society on a broader level than the site most people casually read while taking a shit or when they are bored at work. I commend the moderators of this subreddit for continuing to serve the userbase by facilitating discussion rather than using the subreddit as their own ideological battleground.",

I get that it's supposed to send a message that \"we have the power\" but you're also telling them to just hold out for 2 days and then also giving them free test data to see how many users stick around and who don't. \n\nQ3: What stops people from just making new subs if the old subs do blackout forever?\n\nLike, if someone has a niche and there is no sub for it they'll just make it anyway no?\n\nNow I don't like spez like most people since he acts like an complete goofy ah, partially maybe due to pressure from above to make money.

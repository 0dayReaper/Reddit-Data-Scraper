Like sure I personally sympathize Apollo and those 3rd party apps, but on the same time suppressing the right of everyone disregarding their opinions is equal to mob rule. And I have to say in reality, a full blackout seems like an extreme measure that causes more disruption than necessary to raise awareness of this issue.\n\nThis is not a simple \"for or against\" situation. There are many neutral stances one can take, and neutrality does not mean supporting reddit's decisions. In instance I am against reddit's decisions but on the same time I am against subreddits mindlessly going blackout without considering the harm to others. A blackout amounts to a disruption of service for those who rely on the forums that go dark. Those against the blackout should not be forced to cope with the view of those for the blackout, disregarding if they are the majority. There are several subreddits out there going down without consent of communities or anyone asking for it. The blackout at this point is in reality primarily affecting innocent individuals who are opposed to or remained silent on the issue instead of targeting reddit themselves.\n\nWhen a fire burns, you try to cool it instead of fueling it. The blackout tactic is not an ideal solution and risks alienating more users than it rallies. There are more reasonable ways to prompt change on this issue without resorting to measures that negatively impact unrelated communities, such as such as simply disabling posting rights. Yet, the actions taken by the subreddit is equal to further worsening the already chaotic situation. People for the blackout complaining about this sub not going down instead of actually heading off reddit are the ones imposing double standards, loud on making demands and complaining while themselves not taking actions that they themselves can do, i.e. stop using reddit immediately for at least 3 days. Reddit earns ad revenue as you continue the flame war attacking innocent people who simply disagree with the blackout.\n\nThis movement is like plenty other movements like Just Stop Oil - good incentive but entirely wrong and harmful methods applied to reach the goal. With less extreme methods present, the issues at stake here do not yet seem to warrant such a widespread shutdown across the network. In summary, the current blackout seems to create more problems than it solves. There are better ways to resolve this situation that do not come at the cost of regular users\u2019 experience.",

They think, \"We walk out, they're done for\", which is rarely the case.\n* Second, going on strike is shooting their Last Bullet -- they've got nothing left, nothing to threaten, no further sanctions to impose.\n * SO, in case the strike doesn't work, **What's your Plan B**?  There usually isn't one.  And I think the same applies here: if the blackout doesn't have its desired effect, **Then What?**\n\nCorporate Reddit has had a week or 10 days to plan and prepare for this widely-announced action, and has obviously decided to gamble that the blackout will flop -- that they can in fact \"limp along\" for a while.  **What if they're right?**  -They- clearly have a contingency plan.  Do -we-?  Or are we working under the assumption that \"We walk out, they're done for\"?",

Collective action is how you bring about change and holdouts in the name of neutrality, apolitical stances, or apathy not only damage that action by undermining efforts but also weakens future efforts that you may want to be part of in the future.",

Many subs have been overmoderated for too long, oftentimes by the same people who use their pledge to \"take moderation seriously\" as a shield to enforce \"no complaining about moderation\" as a law of the land.

Build your own reddit.\n\n\"Opinion discarded because you don't have any karma or posts or awards or whatever\" it's called lurking.

Discussing hosting costs for other platforms similar to reddit, like Tildes, Lemmy, Squabbles, the current admins are referencing hosting costs of under $1/month total supporting thousands of users. \n\nNow reddit certainly has more than thousands of users, but lets scale that up. We'll ignore economies of scale here, and pretend the costs scale in a linear fashion.\n\nIt is estimated that reddit has 55,000,000 daily users, as opposed to 5,000 of these smaller upstarts. 55,000,000 / 5,000 is 11,000. So reddit's costs would be $11,000/month, as opposed to $1/month. $11,000 /  55,000,000 users is $0.0002 / user / month in hosting costs.\n\nThis is why trying to charge a single 3PA dev $20,000,000/year for API access is completely and utterly absurd.\n\nAs I've said before, there are two very simple options to put this all to bed. Either update the TOS of the API to require the 3PA to show reddit ads, or charge users a dollar or two per month to use the 3PA. Based on the very rough math above, that would make reddit far more money  - and not alienate power users and destroy the site.\n\ntl;dr: u/spez isn't a greedy little pig boy, he's just incompetent.",

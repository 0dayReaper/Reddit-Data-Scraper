But pro rate in the monthly costs, and it gets crazy.\n\nIn my area a 1 bedroom in a bad area is still 1200 per month, or about $40 a day.  Transit for most people will be at least $5- and that is cost of mass transit to and from work; more if you drive (car, insurance, upkeep, gas).  Not having a car is not always an option.\n\nOn 40 hours at $10 an hour, you are bringin in about 1200 a month.  You lose some of that to taxes, but lets be nice and say you get it all.  You already cannot afford a studio apartment- so you need a roommate.  So you have to hopefully find someone sane- but that is not a given.\n\nSo basically, on your own, on a full time minimum wage job, you basically are eating garbage to just not be hungry.  living with 2-3 roommates with the same problems you have, and will have no ability to save enough to ever make a difference.  $500 is huge savings over a whole year for you- and that is not life changing at all.",

The mayors were flooded by the angry mobs who kept asking for more and more benefits that were impossible to fullfil, by the end had to admit the amount of work at basic community level was too much to archieve anywhere.\n\nThe show also got cancelled quite soon after a few episodes.",

At the end she said there was no wonder she smoked, life was so hard and miserable, and she'd smoke as well in that situation. \n\nPeople kept petitioning for the likes of Ian Duncan Smith to live on \u00a370 and see how far he gets. Still think that's a pretty good idea for all M.Ps who affect policy",

Here is a quick part of it. It is an interesting read, and it would be interesting if others would help scale it up.\n\nORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Two decades ago, Harris Rosen, who grew up poor on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and became wealthy in the Florida hotel business, decided to shepherd part of his fortune into a troubled community with the melodious sounding name of Tangelo Park.\n\nA quick snap from the city\u2019s tourist engine, this neighborhood of small, once-charming houses seemed a world away from theme park pleasures as its leaders tried to beat back drugs, crime and too many shuttered homes. Nearly half its students had dropped out of school.\n\nTwenty-one years later, with an infusion of $11 million of Mr. Rosen\u2019s money so far, Tangelo Park is a striking success story. Nearly all its seniors graduate from high school, and most go on to college on full scholarships Mr. Rosen has financed.\n\nYoung children head for kindergarten primed for learning, or already reading, because of the free day care centers and a prekindergarten program Mr. Rosen provides. Property values have climbed. Houses and lawns, with few exceptions, are welcoming. Crime has plummeted.",

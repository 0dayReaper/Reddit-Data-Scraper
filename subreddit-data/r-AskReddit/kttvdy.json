If you get hired January second 2020, you wouldn't get your first bonus until 2022.\n\nThere was no manager for the programmers.  There was no director for the IT team.\n\nThey had tracking software for your every keystroke, idle time, programs you were active in.  They would question idle time, which meant people on the phone with clients would be questioned often because their computers would be idle.\n\nThere was a lot going wrong but the interview slip up wasn't enough to really give it away in time.

The game we were working on started picking up traction, and had studios looking to pick us up. The lead on the project immediately got together with an attorney, and drafted up contracts. Not a problem. \n\nI got mine, but there wasn't a rush, and since I had to do regular work for bills, I kind of ignored it for a couple days. \n\nThe lead and his attorney started bombarding me with emails, telling me to sign it. I replied with \"after I read it, I'll let you know\" I immediately got a phone call from the attorney, assuring me it was \"all just standard stuff\" and \"if I wanted to secure my position in the studio, I should just sign it\" \n\nRed flags everywhere. So when I had time, I read it, and I'm glad I did. It stated that anything I worked on in my personal time, which I did a lot of as an artist, was their property, and I had no rights to even show it. If I left the studio for any reason, I couldn't work in the video games industry for a minimum of 12 months. Even though I was working for free I was not allowed to take a paid position at any other game studio, while working with them. The list went on. \n\nI told them I wasn't gonna sign that, and if they pressed I was leaving. They pressed, I left. Find later that the lead started the studio, hired people, then drained the accounts, sold the hardware, locked the doors, and never returned.",

It's hard to predict how much you're going to earn on a piece rate, so to attract me the manager showed me some paystubs from his guys. I noticed that:\n\n1) He could easily cherry pick paystubs to show my his best guys best weeks. All that tells me is that I'm likely to make less than what he's showing me, at least on average. \n\n2) The paystubs were obviously designed to be confusing. They were a full page and absolutely covered in data. He wanted me to be impressed by a dollar amount (obviously not accounting for costs which the contractor has to carry or taxes which the contractor has to deduct and pay) but he took them away before anyone could have deciphered what the pay period, piece rate, number of jobs or kms was.\n\n3) He showed me other people paystubs! wtf??\n\nAnother red flag is that they were desperate to hire, because they didn't have enough contractors to deliver the work contracts they'd already sold. I had two guys from different offices call me *after* I'd declined the position who apparently still thought I was considering it.",

One day I worked until 2:30 AM to finish up a big project, and my boss said to me I could come in an hour later the next morning. Gee thanks bro, with my public transport/travel time that gives me a solid 2 hours of sleep instead of just the one.\n\nEDIT - With all the stories in the reactions on this post, I just wanted to say that there really are good employers out there. Do not stand by being treated so poorly, because you deserve to be treated with respect. For any employers reading this thread, here\u2019s a few examples of how to create a loyal, healthy employee base:\n\nMy current employer puts family first. If there is an emergency at home, they tell you to handle that first. For example when I was miscarrying they told me \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you in the next two weeks at least, take your time and give me a call when you feel ready to come back in, ok?\u201d\n\n9-5 means 9-5. If you have to leave early for something or come in later bc of something, they expect you to take your own responsibility (and don\u2019t even check if you actually catch up the lost time, they just expect that you do). By doing so you create that on the rare occassion that you do have to stay late to finish something, you do that without complaining, because it only happens incidentally and not structurally (and certainly isn\u2019t expected, in fact, they ask if you REALLY have to stay late or if you just THINK you have to stay late). If you both give and take, you\u2019re much more likely to give back. \n\nThey frequently and _genuinely_ ask about your wellbeing. And then also follow that up. If you tell them your mother is unwell, they ask about her a week later. It\u2019s not lost in the abyss that is business, no, you feel SEEN and HEARD. \u201cYou look stressed. Is there anything I can do? Do you want to go over your to-do list together and prioritize what needs done first?\u201d Things like this mean the WORLD. One time they walked in and said \u201cHey, my afternoon meeting got cancelled, I know you have like 15 files that need checking and I\u2019ve seen how full your calendar is, why don\u2019t you give me 4 and I\u2019ll make sure they get sent out today, to lighten your load a little\u201d. \n\nThey focus on little tokens of appreciation. A chocolate easter bunny waiting on your desk at Easter (last year they hid 10 easter eggs in every room, I found one hidden in the box of my crackers hahaha), they make sure your salary is paid before Christmas even though you normally don\u2019t get paid before the 26th, they make sure every secretary gets flowers on Secretary-day, they bought us weird pens (think bright neon color with dangly beads on top) just because they thought it would brighten up our days. Like, it only costs a penny, but it makes your staff feel seen. When there\u2019s a heatwave, they treat us with popsicles. When it\u2019s holiday season, they randomly decide to close the office at noon on Dec 31st \u201cif we have to earn it in the last couple of hours of this day we\u2019re doing something wrong. So let\u2019s shut down for the day, have a good one guys\u201d. \n\nThey do not tolerate gossip. We talk WITH eachother, not about eachother. They hire capable staff, people who are not putting in the work/effort do not last. They will ask us about peoples progress, like \u201cwhat do you think about the new receptionist?\u201d and we can answer frankly, even if our opinion is that they\u2019re not making enough progress etc. They want to know what we think and they value our input. This creates a healthy work environment, with driven people who all have heart for the \u201ccause\u201d. \n\nMistakes are human, and we solve them together without smacktalking about the person responsible. Of course we all have our bad days and it\u2019s ok to mope and murmle here and there to your roommate, but we really try to keep that to an absolute minimum.",

After 31 hours, I told him I needed to go home and sleep for 6 hours and I would be back.  He tried to guilt me into staying and finish.  I quit on the spot.  He showed up at my house 2 hours later trying to get me to come back.  I never answered the door.   Nothing is worse than being unappreciated and then indispensable.\n\nEdit:   To answer questions.   I was an it manager for a company in the Cayman Islands.   The managing partner was exceptionally cheap and had his entire corporation of 30 plus tourist businesses, some large and some small)on two servers  and one dilapidated tape backup system.   The tapes were unusable about 25 percent of the time.   But I was told that the backup tapes would never be used.  My answer was until they are.  \n\nCue this day.   I get there at 8:00 and the backup tapes had failed.  About 4:00 the server fails.    In order to reconcile the sales and inventory, I was forced to use the last day the tapes worked, rebuild the servers and then manually input the sales for all the stores.   Add to this that the company had canned the only other two people who knew the system on the day I arrived 3 months before and it was left to me.  8:00 am to 3:00 ish pm the next day to get is all in then run reports and then get all the store managers to sign off and there you go.  He didn\u2019t want me to leave before the end of the day in case something else happened.  He came over at 5:00 pm.  My brother who worked on island told him to piss off.\n\nEdit 2:   To those who are doubting this happened, it was in 2009 and I was working in the Georgetown in Grand Cayman.  For the record, I have had a number of times that I have worked over 24 hours a day in IT.  Virus remediation and server failures were the usual suspects.   However, in Grand Cayman as a ex-pat you had few options.   If you make waves you are let go without recourse.  If you do keep your job you are gone as soon as your work permit comes up for renewal.  In that time, they could make life miserable.   Please don\u2019t call me a liar because you have no frame of reference for what I did at the time.",

The new accounting person had forgotten to remove the notes section of the annual budgets we handed out at a business meeting. \n\nI confronted my CEO and CFO about it and they made every excuse in the book to try and justify/deny the extreme pay disparity, even though at the time 90% of our sales revenue had been booked by me. They reprimanded me in writing for asking questions about employment contract terms and refused to answer. \n\nCome to find out, the new hires were actually greater idiots than I could have ever imagined and were tracking internal emails in our sales tracking system..nobody knew, but me. Spent four months after my initial confrontation learning everything i could about employment law and screenshooting emails of them plotting to demote me, not give me my full commission, give the guys my clients, tell the salesmen not to talk to me about their contracts..etc. When they finally had the meeting with me about \u201crestructuring\u201d the team, I walked right out and called an attorney. That \u201crestructure\u201d was the final nail in the coffin..allowing to prove direct retaliation.

(The job was at a psychiatric hospital).  I thanked her for being honest with me and said that I was not interested.  As she was walking me out, she leaned in and said, \"you're doing the right thing.  Our last hire quit because he said he was having palpitations all the time here and was worried he would have a heart attack.\"  \n\nAbout 3 years later, at another company, I saw one of the women who had interviewed me.  She worked in a totally different position in a totally different setting.  She said that the other woman who had interviewed me, the one who gave me the warning actually DID suffer a heart attack!  She survived, and she stopped working there.   I was so thankful she warned me.  Most interviewers wouldn't do that.\n\nEdit: and in thinking more about that woman, obviously SHE was very stressed and SHE was having to cover work for that position that needed to be filled.  She could have easily (and understandably) have gone into survival mode and thought \"you know what, let's just hire her [meaning me] and then at least I will have some relief for a month or two until this one quits too.\" \n\nBut she didn't do that, she thought of my welfare, a stranger, over her own interests. And clearly, she was suffering.    I would have relocated for that job too, about 150 miles.  She was aware of that--maybe that played into her decision to warn me, maybe not.  Either way, she was an extraordinary person.",

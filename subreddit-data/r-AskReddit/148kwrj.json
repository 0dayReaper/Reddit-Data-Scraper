Initially he was a bit standoffish, but once we'd bumped into each other enough for him to realize I wasn't some rando fan on the street he warmed up. \n\nNow, there are probably a lot of you here to whom Paul isn't famous or current, but he was a frikkin' Beatle for crying out loud.",

My friend introduced herself very politely and asked for a photo. Gordon sat her down on the bench next to him, I took a few photos, he chatted to us for a couple of minutes and introduced us to his wife and friends.\n\nCould not have been nicer and was genuinely interested in us.

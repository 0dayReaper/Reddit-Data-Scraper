I look at her and I could just see it on her face, she absolutely wanted me. Without saying a word I walk away and Christian Bale makes that face everybody loves to spam",

She just had a horrible breakup, she's spiraling, we were sitting at the bar we worked at, and our manager comes up and hands her a napkin with his number on it. She looked up at him, her face fully wet with tears, wasted, and screamed \"Are you fucking serious, Matt?! GTFOH!\" She threw the balled up napkin at his face and he walked away. 16 years later they're happily married with kids lol",

I have sleep apnea, and it allows me to get my head into the perfect position and *keep* it there comfortably.\n\nEDIT:\n\nBefore you go out and buy one, please research the pro's and cons. They aren't for everyone.\n\nConsider them if you like a firmer pillow, occasionally wake up with an achey neck from lack of support, and want a pillow that breathes well. Someone in the comments has also pointed out that you will win every pillow fight you get into.\n\nDownsides are: if you shift around in your sleep a lot, you'll need to adjust the pillow to fit your new position. Adjusting the pillow and settling in makes a little bit of noise as the buckwheat husks rub against each other, kind of like dry leaves crinkling. Some people are also allergic to buckwheat, but there are other similar fillings such as millet husks. Organic fillings also need to be replaced once in a while, since it breaks down over time.",

Turns out that I should have been going to the dermatologist the whole time. She saved my life. I would have waited it would have went from to lymph nodes to my brain and / or my lungs and that would have been end of story. If my wife did not insist I would not be here right now. So, I get to experience 2020... so, yeah.\n\nin all seriousness, I may not be here. Listen to your wife.\n\nThe end result is  I cannot spend  more than an hour a day in the sun. I need to wear long sleeves and long pants and a ton of sunscreen even for a short time in the sun.\n\nWhat is my motivation? I get to piss off all the people that thought I should be dead. Screw you, I am staying alive to spite you. The only downside is my beautiful wife slaps on a ton of sunscreen everytime I leave the house.\n\nI guess living well us the best revenge.\n\nUpdate note 1: Wow, thank you for all the kind messages, and yes I am doing well. And yes, I do know my wife is awesome. You all are awesome for all the support.\n\nUpdate note 2: To clarify, the surgeries were covered my my insurance with a copay. The reason I say this was less than a $100 is the advice from my wife was free and the copay for the dermatologist was $10.",

You'll end up eating healthier, cheaper than takeout/restaurant, and ditching the dull Walmart knife and scratched up nonstick aluminum skillet are the best place to start.\n\nEditing to add:\n\nSince so many are asking what to get: Victorinox 8\" or 10\" chef's knife, and 10\" lodge cast iron skillet. These in my opinion are at the tippy top of the curve on quality to price ratio. \n\nThese probably leave enough room in the budget to get a $2 steel from goodwill and a large butcher block cutting board. As long as you use the steel with some regularity, a good knife should go a long time before it actually needs to be sharpened.\n\nSecond edit: I agree that a good sharpener is important, but if you have $100 to spend today you can wait on sharpener as long as you have a steel to maintain the edge. You will need one, but not today. \n\nAlso I am going to take another look at carbon steel skillets.",

Whether its pots and pans, or a good chef's knife,  every investment I make in my kitchen increases my quality of life.  \n\nEdit: I feel like a few people are being deliberately negative about this. For those of you who honestly dont think that you can buy good cookware for under $100 dollars I encourage you to temper your expectations of what \"good\" is and check out amazon right now. If you want a full blown set of decent pots and pans there is a ceramic set for around $85 dollars right now. Ceramic cookware is what I started learning to cook on.  Its not perfect but it's a lot better than any teflon or imitation teflon crap out there. If you prefer iron like I do, lodge is a great company and they have a 10 inch iron skillet on sale for $15 dollars right now. Pair that with a decent chef's knife from Mercer $45 (the brand I am currently using) then throw in a dutch oven (looks like you can get one from lodge for 40 dollars and it has a decent rating.) And you're good to go. Those three tools will last for life if taken care of and you can make so much with them. A shepherd's pie, pizza, fresh bread, soups and stews, stir fry..... I mean almost anything.  Pro tip, even if it says preseasoned, look up how to season it anyway. And never use soap on your iron.  Scrub it in the sink under hot water, heat it up on the stove to get the moisture off fast, when it cools off rub it down with any old cooking oils. Just a thin layer with a paper towel will do.",

            "comment": "The right shampoo and conditioner. Am dude.\n\nI use this super girly looking stuff called love beauty and planet, and my hair is glorious and I love putting my hands into it. And other people like putting their hands in my hair too. Generally women.\n\nFemale marketed products are vastly superior in so many ways, and dudes won't buy it because they're forced into the men's marketed section with bears and wolves and trees that represent shitty college smelling products that are 12-in-1 body/hair/dish/clothes/car wash. \n\nHair is hair. Choose the products marketed towards people who give a shit about their hair. Be the beautiful man you were meant to be.\n\nEdit: that is a ton of comments. I'm gonna try to get to them later, but for those who want to know, [this is my shampoo](https://www.lovebeautyandplanet.com/us/en/hair/products/shampoo/sulfate-free-argan-oil-&amp;-lavender-shampoo.html) and [this is my conditioner](https://www.lovebeautyandplanet.com/us/en/hair/products/conditioner/argan-oil-&amp;-lavender-conditioner.html). I used to use Aussie brand conditioner, which did decent things, but felt oily.\n\nEdit2: I have straight hair, but have found r/curlygirl to have great resources. Sulphate free shampoo if where it's at.\n\nEdit3: I'm seeing a TON of people recommend Mane and Tail. I'm sorely tempted to try it after reading all these...\n\nEdit4: Holy shit, apparently there's an 18-in-1 soap. And I thought 12-in-1 was absurd. The kind redditor u/Gilthoniel_Elbereth has put forward https://www.drbronner.com/ for your consideration.",

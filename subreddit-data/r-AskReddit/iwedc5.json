The Egyptians, I understand, had a belief that if one learned the true name of a deity, one gained power over the deity. One finds this belief showing up in the story of Ra and Isis.\n\nIn this cultural context, Moses' actions can be seen to be quite dishonorable, by our standards - he's trying to trick God into putting Himself at Moses' mercy. The answer God gives is not his real name, it is stern correction being given to a human who has far out-stepped his bounds.\n\nAs for what God's name really is - if He exists, how could He possibly have one? We're talking about somebody has been present in the Universe from its beginning, and exists outside of it, beyond the bounds of space and time. Why would some collection of sounds that just happen to be easy to pronounce by a collection of barely jumped up apes on an insignificant planet be His name, billions of years before the planet said apes live on even existed?\n\nThe whole \"real name of God\" thing is silly, just human beings wanting to believe that they're much more powerful and important than they are. Wondering what happens to that sort of thinking when we finally meet our first aliens, and discover that we're not the pinnacle of creation? Or of existence, as the case might be?",

Cuz if the pope came out and announced that he alone had this vision my opinion probably wouldn't change much since i already have my doubts about the pope. But if a massive group of people said it, maybe that would be different. Was it a group of people in one place? Cuz in that case it could be a massive group hallucination, but if people all over the world started saying the same thing on the same day that would definitely cast more doubt over the situation... but if Jod appeared to every human individually to make this announcement, id probably stop being agnostic and be forced to reconcile that Jod does exist and everything i know is a lie.\nEdit: thanks for the gold!!",

Apparently, destruction of God's name only applies to non-temporal surfaces, so tracing the name in sand on the beach or holding the name written backwards up to a mirror and then taking it away don't count, and therefore neither does the name on an electronic display. Ancient explanations for modern problems, it's pretty crazy.\n\nMy favorite is still Ilan Ramon asking for advice on when to celebrate the Sabbath while in Low Earth Orbit given that there's a new sunset every 90 minutes. They still had an answer. Apparently, the question had come up before during 19th century polar expeditions (where there are months of continuous sunlight) and at the time they had argued that a person should defer to a clock synched from the last possible accurate time source, which in turn was a counterargument to a centuries older discussion on when to observe the shabbat if trapped in a cave, which in turn referred to a thousand-year-old discussion regarding someone in the desert that has lost track of what day it is. Bottom line--ceremonies are observed based on spacecraft time, which is based on the Control Center time.",

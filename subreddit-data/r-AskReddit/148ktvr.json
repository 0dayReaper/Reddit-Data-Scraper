He was pretty well known for entertaining folks at the lunch spot a bunch of these authors frequented by telling outlandish stories about his life; unlike his later followers, they all knew he was full of shit but they still had fun listening. Maybe genius is going too far, but he was certainly charismatic enough to manipulate people.\n\nAdditional fun fact: He actually wasn't a fan of science fiction and only started to write it when an editor asked him to submit for a newly launched sci-fi magazine. The adventure stories he wrote before that, while still being schlocky pulp fiction, are actually kinda decent. His sci-fi stories are pretty crap, I think he let his general distaste for the genre bleed into his work.",

Up until then they'd basically gate that story behind your 'tier' within the organization. You're only allowed access to that story once you reach the upper tiers of the org, at which point you're already hundreds of thousands of dollars in, your whole social network is confined to members of the 'church,' and you basically have nowhere else to turn unless you want to start your life over. Plus endless harassment from other church members. So closer to your option 1 than anything else.\n\nFeel free to take that with a grain of salt, but that's my understanding",

Seriously, how elitist do you have to be to hear someone say something, then to have your assistant say it to you again, then repeat it out loud to the assistant, to have the assistant tell you...  Full douche move.\n\n2.  She claimed discrimination at a handbag shop one time when asking a store clerk to way beyond over the top to get a bag out of storage so she could see if she liked the it, when there was an identical one on the floor.   And since the girl balked at getting the one in the back, it was discrimination.  Seriously, if you want to check to make sure that bag that you want to buy is in perfect condition is one thing, but getting it out of the back when there's an identical one on the floor is completely other.\n\n3.  And the \"you get a car!\" episode was accompanied by every person having to pay the tax on it before they left the studio....",

He is good at manipulation but its easy to point out the flaws in what he says if you are paying attention and not a young child. Take the time to watch a video with your son if its remains a problem so you can point out the issues and don't be mad at your son when you do it. He's also a victim of Tate's. Simply saying Tate's bad and that your son shouldn't watch him may not be enough. Tate wants to be the wedge between you and your son so that he is the goto for advice.",

Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward\u2014reversing cause and effect. I call these the \u201cwet streets cause rain\u201d stories. Paper\u2019s full of them.\n\n&gt; In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read.

Take the time to watch a video with your son if its remains a problem so you can point out the issues and don't be mad at your son when you do it. He's also a victim of Tate's. Simply saying Tate's bad and that your son shouldn't watch him may not be enough. Tate wants to be the wedge between you and your son so that he is the goto for advice.",

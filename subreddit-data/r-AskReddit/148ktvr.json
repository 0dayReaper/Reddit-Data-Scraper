He is good at manipulation but its easy to point out the flaws in what he says if you are paying attention and not a young child. Take the time to watch a video with your son if its remains a problem so you can point out the issues and don't be mad at your son when you do it. He's also a victim of Tate's. Simply saying Tate's bad and that your son shouldn't watch him may not be enough. Tate wants to be the wedge between you and your son so that he is the goto for advice.",

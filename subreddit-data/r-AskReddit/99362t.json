Around 2016-2017 they sort of stopped doing the \"educational\"  list-articles they became famous for, about history, science, psychology, religion, literature, etc., and started to focus almost exclusively on modern pop culture (music, video games, movies, TV, celebrities), and their readership suffered for it.\n\n\n Before the entire site was converted to the new format at the end of last year, all Cracked articles had a view counter at the top of the page to show you how many people had read it. From about 2009-early 2016, the typical daily \"main\" front page article, most always a list article written by a contributor like me,  could get between 400k to over 2 million views within its first week up on the site (my least-read article had 450k, my most-read was over 3 million at last count). Last year, just before the new format was laid out, the main front page articles over the previous three months or so were struggling to hit 200k in a week, even when \"viral\".",

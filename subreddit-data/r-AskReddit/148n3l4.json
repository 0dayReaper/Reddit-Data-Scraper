Normally it takes me 6 months to get to point where I know I am \u201cin love\u201d, but I was there. Sex was amazing, we never got into any big fights and the small disagreements we had were sorted out and resolved quickly.\n\nThen the trip happened and she felt cold all weekend. Get back home and she breaks up with me. Talk about whiplash. Still sorting it out in my head. \n\nAt the end of the day we had a lot of big differences, none of which were dealbreakers for me, but I guess they were for her\u2026",

I bought a shitty used car that was supposed to be saftied when I bought it, it wasn't so we had it checked at another shop and then brought it back to the original shop to get it fixed.  3 days later the gas company sends me a bill for 2k saying we've been undercharging you for a year and a half. Then the government sends us a letter saying we've been overpaying your baby money so they will be stopping payments for 3 months to recoup that. Our family dog had an infection and needs 500$ in meds to fix.  The nest egg we've been saving for 2 years is now almost gone. \n\nOn top of all this my current employment is so far away I drive 2.5 hours a day, I'm currently looking for something close to home but to no luck. Also the coworker I have been working with for 2 years has lately been insulting me, yelling at me when I make a mistake (even if it wasn't my mistake), and generally making me feel like a piece of shit while at work. My anxiety from all this is skyrocketing and I can't get to see a Dr until the end of the month. \nAll this happend within 3 weeks.",

My name isn\u2019t common, I won\u2019t say my full name obviously but I\u2019ll use a fake one for example: her name is Mara Louise Bordeaux and my name is Marah Louis Bordeaux. Our names are only two letters different, only thing spelled the same is our last. I was skeptical at first because she lived on the other side of the United States. But I knew she probably had family linking back to Haiti because that\u2019s where most people with my last name are from. \n I found her Facebook page and clicked through her friends list and typed my last name, then I found her dad. I went through his friends list and found my cousin\u2026I clicked through my cousins friends list who also shared the same last name as my aunt. My dads sister. During that time that I was stalking that girl, I didn\u2019t know we were cousins. Worst thing is that we almost look the same\u2026\n  The thing is I wasn\u2019t purposely named after her, my mom unknowingly decided to give me the first name I have now last minute before I was born. And my mother gave me my middle name after her dead sister\u2026she died moments after birth\u2026in the 1980s. \n  The girl who I share the same name with was born in the late 90s, I was born in the early 2000s. \n  Also know that my mother is unaware of this girl who I share the same with, she doesn\u2019t know who she is. I\u2019m pretty sure my dad isn\u2019t as familiar with her either, but I haven\u2019t asked him yet. He\u2019s never brought up to me.",

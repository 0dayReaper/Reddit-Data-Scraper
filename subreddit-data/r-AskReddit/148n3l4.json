But I knew she probably had family linking back to Haiti because that\u2019s where most people with my last name are from. \n I found her Facebook page and clicked through her friends list and typed my last name, then I found her dad. I went through his friends list and found my cousin\u2026I clicked through my cousins friends list who also shared the same last name as my aunt. My dads sister. During that time that I was stalking that girl, I didn\u2019t know we were cousins. Worst thing is that we almost look the same\u2026\n  The thing is I wasn\u2019t purposely named after her, my mom unknowingly decided to give me the first name I have now last minute before I was born. And my mother gave me my middle name after her dead sister\u2026she died moments after birth\u2026in the 1980s. \n  The girl who I share the same name with was born in the late 90s, I was born in the early 2000s. \n  Also know that my mother is unaware of this girl who I share the same with, she doesn\u2019t know who she is. I\u2019m pretty sure my dad isn\u2019t as familiar with her either, but I haven\u2019t asked him yet. He\u2019s never brought up to me.",

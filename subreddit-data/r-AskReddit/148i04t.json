I've had others try to re-establish the friendship as they attempted to reach out, and when I asked if they are only contacting me because they need something, they would say no, and I would offer to meet them for lunch or meet somewhere, but they were all of a sudden too busy. I told them to contact me when they didn't need my help. Crickets since.",

The guy came up behind me and wrapped an arm around my shoulder. I don't remember saying anything other than whatever greeting a kid would normally say in between classes at the lockers. Rather than dropping his arm away like I expected, he clinched up around my neck and I just got maybe a word out in time before he pulled in the choke, like 'Naww-.' He was saying something like \"no wait, I just wanna try...\" and squeezed it in. I was super annoyed because I was trying to hurry up and get my locker closed. I tapped but he didn't let up. The hallway went gray and the sounds got distant. \n\nHe let it go and I said something like 'Wtf.' I could tell he was a little embarrassed but didn't apologize or say anything like 'you good?' He just sort of threw up his hands and went 'heh heh' and walked. Dude just wanted to flex a bit a I guess.",

If I asked to borrow something, she would shove me into a wall. If she copied my work and I got a question wrong, she would kick me.  I just assumed that it's ok because shes my friend and that's what friendships are like. I was friends with her for two more years and the violence got worse. It was only after those two years when I realized that she was going too far so once when she went to hit me, I blocked it and punched her in the face. She moved schools.

This made me panic a bit because I realised that no matter what I did, he didn't want to be friends anymore, so I confided in someone I trusted who knew both of us, and she went and spoke to him about it, and apparently he said that a classmate of ours told him that I said something to a girl, who then told the classmate, and then told him (whatever that something was, I still don't know). The girl and I are actually best friends, and when I asked her if I said anything wrong, she had no idea. It just really hurt to know that he didn't value our friendship, and that made me give up on trying to be his friend in return.",

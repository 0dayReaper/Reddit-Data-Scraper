It's very specialized, and I work on the infrastructure side of IT, specifically routing and switching, but the amount of people who ask me to build them a website, fix the Google for them. or create an app for them is crazy. That's like asking a urologist about your heart palpitations or your toothache. And, just cuz I can configure a switch doesn't mean I know programming... one of my degrees is in CS, but I've never programmed anything outside of school. I wouldn't even know where to start.",

Teachers must have a strong handle on both, or they can't do the job.",

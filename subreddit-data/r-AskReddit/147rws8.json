But, (and this is one of the reasons I quit photography) the bride sees some of the photos I had sent her, and immediately is calling me. \u201cI need you to do the editing magic and make me look skinny, John was saying I was going to look too fat in my dress and wanted me to lose weight but I knew you could just edit it, so haha I didn\u2019t\u201d. So I have to explain (this is like 2010) I can only photoshop so much, I.e. I can make you look a tad slimmer in certain photos without making it noticeable. But I can\u2019t do it to all of them, and if I was to, the editing would be noticeable, and I will have to charge you a lot of money to edit you in all the photos. She tried to convince me to edit hundreds of photos for a couple hundred bux, and I have other jobs going and had given them a great deal already so explained I couldn\u2019t. So she insist I do at least some of her main pics, I tell her when people see the rest of the pics they will see the difference, she didn\u2019t care and insisted more. So I do, and a couple weeks later when I thought it was all done and history calls me and leaves me a voicemail of how I ruined her wedding, her new husband is upset at how she looks in the pics and keeps making remarks about her weight. So didn\u2019t seem like they were in a great place from the get go.",

I peaked over his way and could see two groomsmen hauling the thrashing and screaming bride towards the lake. They threw her into the freezing cold water with her veil and dress still on. When she got out of the water I genuinely thought she might shoot somebody. Saying she looked like a drowned rat would have been an insult to rats. Her hair and makeup and probably the dress were ruined beyond repair. The fact that the groom laughed and didn\u2019t do anything stuck with me as being a dog shit move even as a teen.

My wife's friend in my opinion is a wonderful person, very caring and smart but suffers from a bad inferiority complex. She did the online dating thing for a while and dated this stereotypical rich dude from a WASPy family (he was a corporate lawyer). Absolutely did not mesh personality wise with her. Forgot to mention my wife's friend also came from a very well off family, but she never flaunted it or fit any of the stereotypes of a rich person.\n\nSo they end up getting engaged and everytime we hung out as a group, I would struggle to find topics to talk with the guy about because all the wanted to discuss was baseball and the stock markets, two topics I couldn't care less about.\n\nSo at the wedding which was held at this very fancy venue in our city, they did the obligatory religious ceremony, walked around together and thanked people. But once the reception was going on, the groom literally hung out with his frat brothers the whole time. My wife's friend pretty much stayed glued to my wife and her other friends and they danced all night. The only time the groom peeled away was to do the first dance thing together and then he literally went back to bro-ing it up with his friends. I even pointed the out to my wife during the reception and my wife tried to steer her friend to her friend's now husband, but he would see them approaching and yell out he needed to grab some drinks for the guys and disappeared. \n\nThis is the worst part. At the end of the wedding, the expectation is they would leave together, right? Nope, the groom said he and the guys were going to go out around town so he could say a final goodbye and he will meet his wife at the hotel later. I was fucking blown away at what a horrible fucking match he was",

            "comment": "I used to be a wedding photographer in Las Vegas at several hotels and downtown wedding chapels. I\u2019ve got so many of these stories. \n\nHere\u2019s a fun one. \n\nMonday - I get booked to shoot the wedding \nWednesday- hotel calls me to cancel because the bride backed out. \nThursday- hotel calls to rebook me because wedding is back on. Same groom but different bride. \nFriday - I shoot the wedding with the new bride about 18 or 19 years old (groom was early 20s) and it\u2019s clear they barely know each other. Bride just kept saying \u201cthis is so crazy, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this\u201d. Neither could I.  No, it wasn\u2019t a mail order bride. \n\nHere\u2019s a sad one\u2026 \nOlder couple, I\u2019d guess in their 40\u2019s/50\u2019s. The limo driver calls and tips me off that the bride is being a problem. She arrives and is extremely rude to everyone on the staff while the groom is being apologetic and super nice. The ceremony starts and she fast walks down the isle doesn\u2019t wait for the groom. The groom sheepishly catches up at the altar. When it\u2019s her time to say \u201cI do\u201d she says \u201cyea whatever\u201d in a bitchy annoyed tone. The groom says \u201cI do\u201d.  You could cut the tension in the room with the knife. The minister keeps things in track and finishes the ceremony and we get to the kiss. Instead of kissing the groom she turns her face and gives him her cheek. She then fast walks back down the isle, signs the paperwork and left. The groom was in tears. Never saw them again and I\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t last. \n\nHere\u2019s another\u2026\nI would guess the bride was in her 70s and the groom was in his early 20s. One side of the chapel was all walkers and oxygen tanks while the other was drunk 20 something\u2019s. Pretty sure it was a money grab but it was notable because normally the genders are reversed on these kind of weddings. \n\nAnother fun one\u2026.\nWedding was at the top of the stratosphere tower. The couple shows up and the bride is a new age crystal type very, let\u2019s say, spiritual and the groom straight up looks like a 1849 gold miner. Rope belt, floppy hat, 3 teeth the whole thing. The bride tells me there would be spirits and angles in the photos and the reason they got married at the stratosphere is because it\u2019s the closest place to heaven that they could get married. They were so weird about it and said so many times that they wanted to be with god and go to heaven that the hotel had the bomb dog sniff them before getting on the elevator to go to the top. We lie and tell them it\u2019s standard practice to have the dogs sniff everyone. Wedding happens and they start chanting nonsense words (speaking in tongues?) then proceed to have the grossest make out session I\u2019ve ever seen. Turns out they met that week in AA.",

It was cute, but I felt his hand slip out of mine and I turned around at the door to the elevator to see that he'd stopped a few feet back to talk to his friends some more. I looped my arm through his \u2014 yet again he didn't include me in their conversation \u2014 and stood there awkwardly rubbing his arm to try to get his attention.

But when prompting couples for fun poses like whispering obscenities in each others ear for a laughing shot, nuzzling close together, etc, most couples eventually let their guard down and enjoyed holding each other. It was so sweet. \n\nA few times though, I had couples that visibly didn\u2019t want to be near each other at all. Once the shot was done, they went back to standing a foot apart. They would complain about each other and make fun of each other in front of me. It always left me with a bad feeling in my gut - and most of the time the marriage didn\u2019t last long!",

At the reception the groom didn't want his brother, the best man, in the photos. Other eyebrow goes up. The mothers of both the bride and groom both scolded me to let them be and told me to eat instead of take photos. The groom and the best man got unholy drunk and had a weird by play of brother making way too many toasts and the groom making grossly inappropriate speeches of what he's going to do to the bride on the honeymoon.\n\nAs the newlyweds were making their grand departure the bride tosses the bouquet, everyone cheers. The groom shouts \"I knocked the bitch up so hard she's got two babies in her coochie\". Guest react in various ways of shock and happiness about the pregnancy test but the best man lunges at the groom shouting and swearing. Family holds the best man back as the couple runs out to a car. The groom flipped off the spectators, and pulled out of the driveway. Two houses down the car stops, the groom gets out and pukes on a neighbor's lawn, the bride gets in the driver's seat and takes off, leaving her husband yurking into a flower bed, and the best man ran down the street trying to flag down the car.\n\nDivorced four months later.",

Those two last maybe a year. The bride ended up moving states for a new job which made sense to me after seeing how shitty her friends and family were during that wedding. \n\nThe other couple I can think of had 12 bridesmaids/groomsman EACH, yes 24 people just in the wedding party. Not including users, guest book attendant, flower girls etc. The bride and groom belonged sorority/fraternity at the same school, that's why there were so many people. The bridesmaids/groomsmen had all dated each other and several of them had dated the bride and groom in college too, so it was a ton of fighting and drama the whole day.\nThose two lasted a while. I think 5 years. But the bride got pregnant on their honeymoon. I doubt they would have lasted a year if she hadn't gotten pregnant so quickly. Years after they broke up, I was invited to the bride's younger sister's bridal shower (they were family friends) and the og bride got drunk on champagne and talked about how miserable she was planning her first wedding, and besides her daughter it was the biggest mistake of her life blah blah, so that was fun.\n\n**Edit: For the confused comments, the last bride regrets the marriage, not the daughter. Sorry I should have been more clear. She regretted getting married to her first husband/wedding but NOT having her daughter. The daughter is in Jr high now, seems very happy and loved.",

Groom picked his guys' outfits (all letterman jackets and jeans in a country where our high schools/colleges don't do that), Bride had the bridesmaids all in shabby, short skirted versions of her wedding dress and Sketchers shoes. Honestly it looked alright. The wedding photos with the bridesmaids and groomsmen looked fun, like a flash mob in a movie; well choreographed and rehearsed clearly. \n\nBUT\n\nIn all the pics he was in the groom was always on his phone, scrolling or texting. Even the wedding cake photos he has his phone in one hand behind his back, fully in view. What was so important on his wedding day? Well he was checking dating sites. The whole. damn. day.

Your wedding day should be a happy day, but sometimes it's just stressful; stress can get to people and make them act in a way they normally wouldn't.\n\nI think the \"worst\" moment I witnessed was when a couple clearly didn't know each other very well.

When I arrived, there was a 5 gallon Home Depot bucket of dirty diapers on the front porch. I had a feeling this wasn't going to go well. A young kid probably 7 or so answered the door, all I could see and hear were children running around everywhere. The soon to be husband was sitting on his bed that was in the living room watching TV and the bride was in the kitchen with two kids on either hip. She told me to sit at the kitchen table to go over the wedding details. She shouted at her fiance to come and join the meeting where he didn't acknowledge that I was there to talk about shooting their wedding. The bride was annoyed, then asked if I saw the bucket full of dirty diapers on the porch. I said that I had, and she said her fiancee has so many kids with other women that is the only place to keep them so they don't stink up the house. \n\nI did not take the job.

My husband and I have been together for almost 14 years, married for nearly 10. However things are not fabulous and we are looking to start counseling with someone before it's too late.\n\nThis is one of my examples of our problems. I asked him not to smash cake in my face at our wedding, he did it anyway. He's also done it to me when we were guests at other people's weddings, despite asking him not to. We were at a wedding this past weekend and I very bluntly told him that if he pulled that shit despite me very clearly telling him I did not want him to, we wouldn't have a 10th anniversary to celebrate. He managed to resist the urge after that, but I thought it was 50/50 if he'd be smart enough to realize I was serious, or if I'd actually be calling a divorce attorney this week.\n\n*Edit: whomever gave this the cake award, I snorted laughing, so thank you for that, genuinely.*",

She eventually starts crying and the photographer at this point looks **extremely** uncomfortable. Pretty much everyone on the trail was looking at this dude at this point, thinking this guy might be serious. He started yelling at her for making him look bad in front of everyone, but eventually calmed down and all was well. Super weird experience. \n\nBut man, what a view. Highly recommend, 10/10.",

My guess as to why people were holding the Dad back was that the Groom was in full Marine dress uniform and they used his sword to cut the cake, that sword was very much in arms reach of the Groom after this happened, so everyone was probably worried something really bad could happen if those two got near each other. After the incident, it was really awkwardly silent as the Groom apologized to the family and if I remember correctly (this was 10 years ago or so) him and the Dad went outside for around 20 minutes, then came back in. The rest of the reception went normally after that.",

They did eventually, but before then, the priest, videographer, and I found a brewery down the street that was open and hung out for a few hours. \n\nThe priest was a chill guy, but the videographer kept wanting to talk about how he didn't usually do weddings and mostly worked with sororities, making recruitment videos. He *kept* bringing it back up or forcing the conversation in that direction. I thought it was weird for a guy his early 40s to be that excited to talk about all the time he spent with teenagers/early 20s kids, and he said a few things that implied that that's how he knew the bride, and that that was how he *knew* the bride. \n\nFigured it wasn't meant to last, but the guy seemed like a liar so who's to say",

            "comment": "I posted this a year-or-so ago when asked about the trashiest wedding I've been to. Fits here for a repost:  \n\nMy cousin got married by a country justice of the peace. She allowed them to use her backyard, a barren clumpy plot of land that abutted a corn field. They decorated her clothesline pole with crepe paper the night before to get married under. It rained in the early morning so it was all splotched and sagging by the time of the service. I was asked to be the wedding photographer because, you know the experience a 16 year old, high school newspaper photographer has makes him very qualified. Near the clothesline, there was a goat tied to a tree, casually munching on whatever goats eat. There were hardly any chairs to sit on so most people gathered around the bride's mother (my aunt) who was beaming with joy. The Justice, a dowdy, matronly woman, didn't seem happy to be there as it was obvious from her demeanor that this wedding thing was disruptung her day and her soaps. When her Honor determined a quorum had gathered, she clapped her hands and said \"Let's get this over with!\". At that point it was discovered that the goat wasn't tied so securely to the tree and it ambled over to his owner to stand next to her, making it an official part of the wedding party. After 2 minutes of a rushed exchanging of vows, the justice stomped up her back porch and disappeared into her house. The goat wandered back to his tree. The wedding party broke up quite quickly from there and we all waved as the blissful couple departed in his Sunbeam bread delivery truck that they were going to use as a camper to spend their honeymoon at the beach. I wish I could tell you that I have pictures to post, but the bride asked for the undeveloped rolls of film explaining she would develop them herself. Three months later, she was able to get the marriage annulled when he left to do a late night, emergency bread run and never returned home. I so wish I had a picture of that goat.",

They owned a photography company together and were mostly ok and normal for our engagement shoot. COVID hit and we had to delay our wedding and by the time we got married they had a baby who was a few months old. They were super nasty to each other at our wedding and neither seemed like they wanted to be there. Found out via Facebook that he left her and the baby a few months after our wedding.",

I am a full-time, professional wedding officiant.  \n\nI don't keep tabs on the \"success rate\" of my couples, but I do cringe on the inside when the vows are a whole bunch of passive-aggressive punches at each other.  Or a reference to how the bride or groom spends most of their time drunk.  Or a bunch of, \"I know you hate it when I ____, but you are stuck with me now.\"  Marriage doesn't mean the surrender of one person's personal boundaries. \n\nThen you have the couples where they both secretly talk shit about the other person.  Not in a fun way, either.  \n\nI'd say this behavior isn't regular, but it's not uncommon.  Maybe 10-15% of my couples secretly (or not-so) hate one another.",

I was actually really impressed by how seriously she took it - she did some couples counselling work, asked us about things like children, religion, our expectations of ourselves and each other...we'd discussed most of the things she asked, but not all, and it was good to consider the things we hadn't thought about.\n\nTwelve years later we're still happily married. Thanks, rabbi!",

There were multiple couples but this was the best one. \n\nThis groom thought he was such hot shit. Wannabe gangster type dude. Durring ceremony he wore sunglasses for one. Then for the vows, he wanted his young kids to come up and be next to him for some reason. So durring the bride\u2019s wonderful, long, thought-out vows, the kids were fucking around with the lapel mic I put on him the whole time, so all he did was ignore her and pay attention to them. When her vows ended he laughed at her. All the guests laughed when he laughed. Then It was his turn and this was literally his vows\u2026 \n\n\u201cI mean, imma wing it. I just knew about this last night. I mean, what can I say? You\u2019re perfect. Um. You make my heart stop. Um. (Points to his kids) these are my boys. You are my world. That\u2019s all that matters.\n\nAnd that was it. \n\nHe never said I love you once to her the whole day. Durring toasts, he gave a speech thanking the bride\u2019s mom for funding the wedding.. then to the guests: \u201cI want to thank all of you guys for joining us on this special event. Um. Life changing. Um. I love my sons, my brothers, and parents, and aunts, and uncles, and cousins, and my co-workers! Wooo! Um. I love you guys. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to be part of this day. You guys are my world. And to Ashley (his wife) \u2026 we\u2019re having fun yeah? \n\nAnd that\u2019s all he said to her. He thought he just delivered the best speech ever too and when he hands the mic over to her, he said \u201cTop that\u201d with the most smug look on his face. \n\nAs a bonus his best man was wasted and this was his toast:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hap-happy for (the groom). Ha-happy\nfor Ashley. Happy for her parents, his mom. For his friends. It makes everybody happy when... yer-one person\u2019s happy... at all. And if it doesn\u2019t... then honestly, you got problems. Straight up (sips his drink)I don\u2019t know half of you guys, half of you guys don\u2019t know me. And I don\u2019t give a shit. That\u2019s it. (He chugs his beer and places the glass on the couple\u2019s table) I met her mom the last couple days.\nAnd Matt(a groomsman). Matt is cool as hell. I don\u2019t give a... crap. I got three sisters, and I\u2019m here for them. So to her mom, dad, and Matt. I got you, Matt. That\u2019s it.(not quite) But when I met Ashley\u2026 I thought she was just another person. But you\u2019re not. That\u2019s it.(He picks up the bride\u2019s beer and takes it with him)",

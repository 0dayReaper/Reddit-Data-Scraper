But the pharmaceutical companies made some minor changes and then patented that. That's why they can sell it for these exorbitant prices.\n\nBanting and his colleagues would be spinning in their graves today.\n\nEdit: I should have rather said \"incremental changes\". As pointed out by a few comments below, a lot of effort has since been put to make insulin safer and effective. However, after Frederick Sanger discovered the structure of human insulin and thus enabling the manufacturing a synthetic version using modern methods there are no excuses for the unfair pricing.\n\nPS - Both Banting (1923) and Sanger (1958) won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for thier work on insulin.",

This should effectively raise the socio-economic state of the bottom 50% of people.

The people of the middle eastern countries, fed up with their quality if life, finally get peace. Rebuilding of many destroyed city's and towns, a major upgrade to infrastructure in the areas.\n\nAug-Oct) cure for some forms of cancer is finally achieved.

It would equally fuck up local and regional climate connections. This would be the opposite of global warming but would still be climate change and can shift climate patterns.\n\n For example an abrupt drop in northern hemisphere temperature can actually result in severe drought in places like the caribbean because of changes in ocean-atmosphere connections and sea surface temperature/salinity.\n\nSource : myself, I guess because I did my PhD on developing and applying paleoclimate proxies for looking at drought and hurricanes in groundwater.\n\nEdit: WOW there was so much more interest in this post than I thought there would be. At the request of another reditor, I will make an IamA... AMA and I can answer more questions about dirt there.

Thank you for everyone that gave me awards, that is very nice and I sincerely appreciate it.\n\nI just want to say that if you are looking for a friend I searched for a subreddit that is dedicated to this /r/Needafriend  (to be honest, if this didn't exist I would make a new subreddit, but this seems great.)\n\nJust to kind of to put this out there, I know everyone has a few IRL friends but sometimes it can be difficult to make new ones, either because of your age or idk, global pandemic.\n\nA few years ago I went through and awful separation that left me with a lot of trust issues.  I started to play Evony and made tons of international \"virtual\" friends.  I used to play the game to get away from everything but then found that the virtual friends that I made were just as awesome as my \"real\" friends.  They were always there to give me advice, or just listen.  You can be that for someone today and it could make all the difference in their life.\n\nSo sincerely, if anyone needs someone to talk to reach out.",

Colour Blindness removed entirely.    \n-Several new upgrades are unlocked early, including Light Speed Travel and Cheeseburger Trees.     \n-All players granted the bonus of either a friendly robot, talking animal or comical ghost companion as hinted at in various in-game advertisements. This includes the rumoured \u2018PokeMon\u2019.     \n-All the controversial story deaths from the wildly unpopular 2016 campaign are undone.     \n-A new clue towards the final mission objective of \u2018Meaning\u2019 is revealed.     \n-Ice Cream Sundays introduced as a weekly event (this was always in the game, but never unlocked due to a typo in the UI code).    \n-Rewards for kindness increased due to general attitude that the grind wasn\u2019t worth the pay off. Bonuses for the \u2018being-a-dick\u2019 tree nerfed.     \n-Players now able to choose a replacement sound for the standard \u2018Fart\u2019 sound effect in customisation options.     \n-Keanu Reeves patched as president of the USA as originally planned.",

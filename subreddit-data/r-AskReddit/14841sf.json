I guess when your body is using your fat cause you can't eat,  it throws off your taste buds. That was definitely true for me and was an interesting experience.",

All I know is I started eating a lot of chocolate in the mornings, And I started staying up later.The more logical solution might have been That I didn't get home from work until late and my girlfriend at the time worked in the mornings, So pretty much as soon as I got home we ate dinner and then bed was very shortly after that. And I believe that giving that extra time after dinner but before bed for me was the solution.  But just to be safe for a long time afterwards I maintained my chocolate breakfast.  In the morning I would either get 6 Boston cream donuts from Dunkin Or I would go to the dollar store get the big Box of nutty bars, And that was my breakfast before work everyday.  The lady at Dunkin definitely knew my order lol.\n\nI do wish you luck on getting that sickness to pass. I suffered a year and a 1/2 of it and I lost a 100 pounds,  It was total hell. And my doctors and gastroenterologists and the 2 hida scans I went thru  All told me I should be healthy yet I was dropping weight like A crackhead or something.",

I got wayyyyy more unsolicited, unwanted, point-blank comments about my body as a skinny person than I *ever* fielded during my entire life as a fat person. I guess I'm lucky the people around me when I was fat had a pretty decent \"politeness filter\" so if anyone ever thought unkind or unflattering things about my overweight body, they didn't say it to my face or gossip about it in a way that ever made it back to me. \n\nBut that changed once I lost weight, it was wild, and very sudden. People, including total strangers, would just say whatever was on their mind about my body, openly speculate to my face about my eating habits, give me unsolicited advice on how to fill out, things like that. It's like their \"politeness filter\" was gone and my body was a fair-game, free-for-all topic for whoever wanted to participate. And then of course there were people who knew me before saying \"wow you look great! what's your secret?\" when I actively looked ill. \n\nI've since gained about 20lbs back and have been comfortably \"average\" for about 8 years, and don't receive comments on my body at all anymore.",

It's been over 3 years since I've had a conversation with a woman my own age. \n\nVery opposite life experiences, so I'm a tad bit jealous. The best I get is a woman I work with insulting me for being subhuman and another getting angry at me for limping. I'd honestly appreciate getting less attention from women in all honesty if that's the best I have to look forward too.",

Sometimes we care so hard that it gets painful, and then our brain tells us that we don't care as a way to protect ourselves. Therapy is a good first step in getting an almost unbiased perspective on yourself so you can identify the thought patterns making things harder for you. It did for me, and I hope it does the same for you.",

Like, good for you you dont work 60-80 a week and spend the rest of your time on hygene and mentally recouping. Thanks boss.\nEnded up firing me and saying they knew I was always there but didn't know why. The kitchen manager(who was working even more hours and had gained even more weight than me) put in his two weeks and they had to hire 9 people to replace the two of us. They had actually screamed at him for being incompetent weeks before for him wanting to hire more people.\n\n6 months later and we are both living healthier and about halfway back to the body shapes we had before that job.",

It should have been one of the best moments ever, but all I had to show for it was this round fat mug. That moment made me realize that I had to do something different.\n\nI did some short-term one meal a day fasting and abstained from alcohol. Those changes helped me drop 26 pounds. Then, I joined a gym and did cardio like a madman. It took a while, but almost a year later, I was down to 169 lbs.\n\nI did not receive any additional positive attention that fatter-me would have been denied. However, there were a few co-workers who gossiped about me and went around telling people that I lost all of the weight from using meth. I guess it was more fun for them to assume that I smoked all of the weight away, rather than making an honest effort. I mean, this came out of nowhere, I never had issues or even flings with meth.

When I was 13/14 and chubby, the only kind of attention I got from boys was negative, like getting called names etc. I felt so self conscious eating anything \u2018unhealthy\u2019 in public because I\u2019d notice people looking at me and I\u2019d assume they were judging me for already being overweight and eating junk food. I had family tell me \u2018no you\u2019re not\u2019 when I told them I was hungry.. It is really messed up but it\u2019s like a switch flipped when I was 16 and underweight. People were so much nicer to me, held doors open, offered me food, piggyback rides, to carry my bags etc. I lost count of the amount of people that told me how \u2018much better\u2019 I looked, even though I lost my period for years, my hair was falling out, I couldn\u2019t stand up without feeling dizzy, I had chest pains etc. The only negative comments I received were from women/teen girls, I got called \u2018skinny b-\u2018 and similar things a few times but that never phased me. Recovery is beautiful and I\u2019m much healthier now, physically and mentally :)",

            "comment": "I've been smoking. I'm adopted and scared they'd make \"the call\" on me and make me leave. The explanation about the call is below. I'm a foster kid who got adopted.\n\nThe call is the scariest thing for me. It's a call to your social worker saying you want them with someone else because you can't handle them anymore.\n\nI've been smoking with my siblings who are 14-17, which isn't the legal age. Legal age to smoke is 18. I wish I can admit it but I'm scared. \n\nAll of us are adopted/foster kids. We all have trauma and I'm one of the schools biggest stoners. It's hard to explain to someone who has never been in the system. \n\nI'm scared the day will come where my social worker will come in and tell me to pack my stuff as I'll be leaving and going to another home. \n\nI can't be open to them of how the system is because I feel as if they wouldn't believe me and brush me off, calling me a liar and dramatic. \n\nThey won't give me therapy as they are 2 1/2 or 3 hours away. Insurance wouldn't cover it and we can't afford to pay out of pocket.",

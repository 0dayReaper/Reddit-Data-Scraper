It was about about 2am, wife is out of town, I decide to have a smoke in the back yard while my two dogs are doing their thing, next I hear what sounds like them wrestling with each other then in the darkness I see a third animal!   Biggest buzzkill ever.  The smell of skunk spray up close is soooooooo much worse than what you smell in the air from a distance.",

Now this was back before D8 was legal, and I'm in the south east, so certainly nothing else was legal either and her aunt dropping off gummies like the weed fairy was a Festivus miracle.  I decided getting stoned and watching Star Trek was on the agenda for the evening. \n\nNow Aunt Weed Fairy is a great person and very generous, but her quality control was..  Spotty..   Sometimes half a gummy was good for a trip around the moon, sometimes 2 whole gummies was a relaxing afternoon.\n\nI this case, I got a doozy.  About an hour in, I got hungry.  I had a couple of frozen burritos in the freezer.  No idea why.  Don't think I'd bought them before (or since).  So I fired up the microwave and settled down with my dinner.  Upon a later review of the evening, I found that the package for the burritos was damaged.  \n\nI had gotten a bad frozen burrito.  I was WAY too high and nauseous.  I hugged the toilet like a long lost pet.  The time dilation from the weed stretched my misery into what seems like days of vomiting.  \n\nI woke up late the next morning in the bathroom floor.  Threw out the remaining burritos, and resolved to find a better supply.",

Anyway, I just cried myself to sleep. Fun drug.\n\nThe only thing weed ever does is make me anxious, sad or paranoid and I've given it *many* chances over the years.

From my mind I was teleporting around the room, sitting, standing, pacing, laying down, but my memory span would be 3 seconds long until it reset and I had sense of a constant flow of time. \n\nMy brain caught on to the fact that I was blacking out constantly with my memory, so I tried to tell my partner to not trust anything I do or say, and dont let me leave the room. I thought I said it one time, but apparently because my brain kept resetting,  for like an hour I just kept begging her not to trust me or let me leave the room. ( I saw video of this later).\n\nThe one coherent thought I could muster, in order to try and counteract the teleporting, was that if I stared into out bedroom mirror and didnt let myself leave my own sight, I could keep an eye on myself to the teleporting would stop.\n\nBad idea.\n\nI watch as I hallucinated my reflection smiling at me mischievously , AND LEFT THE MIRROR, while I was still standing in front of it. \n\nThat sent me into a full blown panic attack, where I had to lay on my bed gripping my sheets, crying, begging that it would end, and I felt like I was there for ever. My brain doubled down on my panic attack since I had convinced myself that I gave myself permanent brain damage, and that I would be a amnesiac vegetable for the rest of my life. \n\nMy partner, as a cope, started playing animal crossing, and for some reason my brain liked that her character never left the exact center of the screen. Eventually watching her play animal crossing guided me out of my paranoia. \n\nYes it was my first time, and it was only 10mg.

I remember crawling on my hands and knees to the bathtub and getting in to soak myself with cold water, thinking it would help bring my heart rate down. Ended up lying naked on the bathroom floor in a puddle, not even able to sit up enough to grab myself a towel. My body was completely malfunctioning and I was completely unable to do any basic motor control. If I was able to get to my phone I\u2019d have called 911 and asked for an ambulance, I didn\u2019t even care that I was naked. When people talk about \u201cprimal\u201d fear, that\u2019s how I felt. I was so afraid my brain literally stopped working and thinking the way it normally does. \n\nMost terrifying experience of my life.",

At first it was great, we went to the beach and gawked at the windsurfers, then ran along the edge cause we just felt like it. I asked my friend to hold onto my phone because I wasn't confident i'd keep it safe.\n\nAs we were running barefoot, we noticed dozen of blue bottles scattered around the sand and this scared the crao out of me. I tip toed my way off the beach and just felt like going home.\n\nOnce we got home I asked for my phone back and my friend couldn't find it in any of his pockets. It must've fallen out when we were running along the beach so now I'm panicked and I go back to the beach to look for it myself, but I can't find it anywhere (most likely stolen). Suddenly, I start peaking and the anxiety is worse than id ever felt before.\n\nI remember going back to my friend and asking him how I can stop being high lol. He said it doesn't work that way bit drink some water and trying sleeping it off. I remember downing 2L and laying in bed just soaking in anxiety about my phone. I couldn't fall asleep lol",

Had an endoscopy and a colonoscopy performed to figure out the cause. Went on for months every few weeks just having days of vomiting. Finally they suggested that it was because of weed use. I stopped smoking and have no more vomiting since. Did find out that i have Crohn's dieses they diagnosed after the colonoscopy at least i know now.",

I don't smoke, so I got a \"space cake\" (an edible, you say?) while being in a party.\n\nThe thing is, dozens of minutes before getting it, I met a girl and we ended up flirting and kissing.\n\nWe ended up in my bed, being surprised that eating that space cake \"did nothing to me\". The lights were dark, and we started doing... well, you know.\n\nThen I started to wonder if this girl in my bed was not trying to kill me. I couldn't tell why I was thinking about that, but I kept having this idea pop up in my mind. I started wondering why she wasn't doing this or that, or responding to things the way I thought... Well, I basically started being paranoid. The thing is, as we were completely in the dark, I could not tell that this was just being high. I basically had just the \"paranoid\" effect, and this was happening in my bed, the first time that I was.. doing things with a girl.\n\nThis basically got my crazy and told the girl that I had to leave my bedroom and go back to the party because I was not feeling well (this doesn't make sense, but you know, I was high). I then just left her there, in my bed, and I went downstairs. Or I actually tried to go downstairs, because I found out that everything was moving wayyy too much and I could barely stand up.\n\nThe party was actually over and I was lucky to still have a friend on the balcony, smoking a last cigarette. She took care of me and told me that it was okay, which was all I needed.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I went back to my bedroom and explained to this girl that I was high and that it was my first time. I apologized, we laughed about it and had an excellent night talking and chilling.\n\nShe was then my girlfriend for 4 years so I guess that she did not care about what happened that night :)",

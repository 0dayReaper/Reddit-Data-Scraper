Now this was back before D8 was legal, and I'm in the south east, so certainly nothing else was legal either and her aunt dropping off gummies like the weed fairy was a Festivus miracle.  I decided getting stoned and watching Star Trek was on the agenda for the evening. \n\nNow Aunt Weed Fairy is a great person and very generous, but her quality control was..  Spotty..   Sometimes half a gummy was good for a trip around the moon, sometimes 2 whole gummies was a relaxing afternoon.\n\nI this case, I got a doozy.  About an hour in, I got hungry.  I had a couple of frozen burritos in the freezer.  No idea why.  Don't think I'd bought them before (or since).  So I fired up the microwave and settled down with my dinner.  Upon a later review of the evening, I found that the package for the burritos was damaged.  \n\nI had gotten a bad frozen burrito.  I was WAY too high and nauseous.  I hugged the toilet like a long lost pet.  The time dilation from the weed stretched my misery into what seems like days of vomiting.  \n\nI woke up late the next morning in the bathroom floor.  Threw out the remaining burritos, and resolved to find a better supply.",

Anyway, I just cried myself to sleep. Fun drug.\n\nThe only thing weed ever does is make me anxious, sad or paranoid and I've given it *many* chances over the years. I'd smoke tiny specks of indica in the hopes of getting a more physical high, but it didn't really work out.",

We were janitor in a hospital. It was supposed to be a chillax afternoon doing my usual thing, almost alone. But there was a fucking big accident around town and I was assigned to the ER. The next hour was litteral hell filled with vomit, screaming and shit. I was like in a bad dream... I finally snapped out of it while emptying a trashcan. Never again on the job.\n\nAnother time I was smoking some shitty weed before bed. I was on my patio listening to music and got really high. I went to bed still listening to music, imagining I was in a show. I don't know what happened but I went in a semi trance state, dreaming but being awake. There was a sudden noise in the kitchen, so I stood up and went to see what was happening. But I never stood up for real. I was still in bed. My wife woke up at the sudden noise and saw I was reacting weird. She had a really tough time waking me up. When I woke, my heart was racing a thousand miles an hour and I was breathless. To this day I'm convinced I had an out of body experience.",

This fast food restaurant had to pay for the employee's medical bills, time off, and some composition from a lawsuit for allowing the offender co-worker to still work there after the incident.\n\nThe employee got a neat scar on his arm.

Got super addicted to drugs. Another former co-worker felt bad for him so they let him stay at their house. Be got the other co-worker pregnant along with their daughter (this was the statutory rape charge), goes to jail for a few years.

From my mind I was teleporting around the room, sitting, standing, pacing, laying down, but my memory span would be 3 seconds long until it reset and I had sense of a constant flow of time. \n\nMy brain caught on to the fact that I was blacking out constantly with my memory, so I tried to tell my partner to not trust anything I do or say, and dont let me leave the room. I thought I said it one time, but apparently because my brain kept resetting,  for like an hour I just kept begging her not to trust me or let me leave the room. ( I saw video of this later).\n\nThe one coherent thought I could muster, in order to try and counteract the teleporting, was that if I stared into out bedroom mirror and didnt let myself leave my own sight, I could keep an eye on myself to the teleporting would stop.\n\nBad idea.\n\nI watch as I hallucinated my reflection smiling at me mischievously , AND LEFT THE MIRROR, while I was still standing in front of it. \n\nThat sent me into a full blown panic attack, where I had to lay on my bed gripping my sheets, crying, begging that it would end, and I felt like I was there for ever. My brain doubled down on my panic attack since I had convinced myself that I gave myself permanent brain damage, and that I would be a amnesiac vegetable for the rest of my life. \n\nMy partner, as a cope, started playing animal crossing, and for some reason my brain liked that her character never left the exact center of the screen. Eventually watching her play animal crossing guided me out of my paranoia. \n\nYes it was my first time, and it was only 10mg. It was such a traumatic experience for me, I have never been able to do it again, and even just recounting this story to you makes my hands shake.",

It seemed for hours and I was sure he and his friends were planning to do something to me. \n\nMy boyfriend drove me to his apartment instead of my house bc I was in a bad state. I proceeded to puke for about an hour and I haven\u2019t smoked since. Edibles are great though.",

I constantly felt this really heavy pressure pushing me to the side and it scared me. Anytime I would acknowledge that pressure, I would let out a nervous laugh because of how scared I was. My now wife, thought I was enjoying the high so she didn't think anything about it. When we got down to the restaurant area, the pressure was getting worse, so bad that I just wanted to go back to the hotel room but we had to get our food so I waited it out. After what felt like a half hour, we get our food and head back up to the room. After, what I can only describe as the world's best mac and cheese, we started watch TV and I kept falling over. Eventually I fell over and just burst into tears because I couldn't get back up. My wife kept asking me what's wrong to which I kept saying I don't know how to explain it.

They were so fast and vivid and the images were of all sorts of things and people from my life. Things that I had completely forgotten about, people that I had probably met once or even just had a small interaction with years ago. It was crazy and it actually scared me.\n\nEventually my friends came and found me and I tried to explain to them what happened but I don't think they believed me.

Luckily I didn't panic and just let the waves crash over me. I was face down in that toilet for two hours.

The one who brake the towel loose, it feels like nothing but you smoke a lot in reality.  \n\n\nAnyway, back at my story, I played the game, everything was fine, and it was getting late, I decided to go home, I get up, take my stuff, go out. Once I'm in the stair case, I feel dizzy. I sat down on the stairs, cold sweat, i'm burning hot, everything is spinning around me I realize I fucked up. I try to get up to knock at my friend's flat, but I just can't. I sat there for Idk how long but it felt like eternity.. I take my last strengths and crawl to the door, It felt like I was dying I coulnd't get up at all.   \nI knock at the door, my friend open, they freak out (obviously) They dragged my ass to the sofa. I was a dead weight and i'm heavy. suddenly, I feel i'm gonne puke, I point at my mouth, my friend quickly gives me the bin...  \n\n\nThe only problem was it was a mesh bin for paper and stuff... I puked my whole day worth of food and drinks in it.. The floor is covered in puke but at least, the chunks of vomit are still in the bin right ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, I never smoked weed again after that and I apologized to my friend for days.",

I don't smoke, so I got a \"space cake\" (an edible, you say?) while being in a party.\n\nThe thing is, dozens of minutes before getting it, I met a girl and we ended up flirting and kissing.\n\nWe ended up in my bed, being surprised that eating that space cake \"did nothing to me\". The lights were dark, and we started doing... well, you know.\n\nThen I started to wonder if this girl in my bed was not trying to kill me. I couldn't tell why I was thinking about that, but I kept having this idea pop up in my mind. I started wondering why she wasn't doing this or that, or responding to things the way I thought... Well, I basically started being paranoid. The thing is, as we were completely in the dark, I could not tell that this was just being high. I basically had just the \"paranoid\" effect, and this was happening in my bed, the first time that I was.. doing things with a girl.\n\nThis basically got my crazy and told the girl that I had to leave my bedroom and go back to the party because I was not feeling well (this doesn't make sense, but you know, I was high). I then just left her there, in my bed, and I went downstairs. Or I actually tried to go downstairs, because I found out that everything was moving wayyy too much and I could barely stand up.\n\nThe party was actually over and I was lucky to still have a friend on the balcony, smoking a last cigarette. She took care of me and told me that it was okay, which was all I needed.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I went back to my bedroom and explained to this girl that I was high and that it was my first time. I apologized, we laughed about it and had an excellent night talking and chilling.\n\nShe was then my girlfriend for 4 years so I guess that she did not care about what happened that night :)",

While there, we realized we brought way more than needed and did not want to fly with them home; we came up with the brilliant idea to pour the cart liquid onto some food and make \u201cedibles\u201d with them. \n\nWe tried it out and put 2 drops on a piece of bread and ate it. Really no reaction so during lunch we decided to go back to our hotel room and use some more. We probably put 6 drops each onto our food. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later we\u2019re waiting for a bus to get back to the parks. Both of us are starting to feel high but whatever. We get onto the bus and a switch flips and I immediately start feeling violently high. Both of us fell asleep on the bus and had to be woken up once we got to the park by the bus driver. \n\nWe get in line for the Avatar \u201cFlight of Passage\u201d ride and are dying standing in line. Neither of us can stand up straight and are leaning up against walls/poles to keep us up. My boyfriend looks me in the eyes with fear and says \u201cI think we did too much\u201d. \n\nWe finally get into the bays for the ride. For this specific ride, they \u201cscan\u201d you in a room to match you with your \u201cNavi\u201d. They \u201cscan\u201d the room and I\u2019m convinced that the scan somehow detected how high I was. At this point I\u2019m panicking. \n\nThey bring us to the ride, where each person is strapped into a motorcycle-like vehicle that locks your legs in during the ride. Thankfully, my boyfriend and I are at the end of the row, so I have him next to me and no one on the other side of me. At this point I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m about to throw up so I look at my boyfriend and tell him I\u2019m going to throw up, and proceed to turn to my other side and throw up on the ground next to me, all while still being locked into the ride. \n\nThe ride begins immediately after I throw up and I have puke all over my face. The ride is 4D and at some point sprays water on you; I used the spray water from the ride to wipe the damn puke from my face and continue to feel sick throughout the whole thing. I honestly don\u2019t remember any of the ride besides the water spray lol. \n\nAfterwards we told the ride attendant I had thrown up and left. We decided to go back to our hotel and I walked the whole way to the bus lot with my head down, I was so ashamed. We got back to our hotel and I then slept for 9 hours. \n\nTerrible experience at the time but a funny story to tell and always makes me laugh now lol\n\nTLDR; Used dab cart liquid to make edibles and got violently high at Disney World",

What he didn't tell me was that he got it from his wife that had chronic pain and had a prescription, so she could get more. It was...what you might say stronger than normal. 20 minutes after smoking half of it, my body started to vibrate, I couldn't tell if what was in my head was actually coming out of my mouth when trying to talk. I tried to lay down as my wife was persistently laughing her ass off. She then says \"text your nephew and ask him what to do\"...grabbed the phone and found out, my thumbs didn't work. That was the longest 2 hours of my life. Went to dinner afterwards and I ordered just a soda and water. My wife \"no liquor? you really are high\".",

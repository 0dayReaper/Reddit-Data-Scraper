I don\u2019t know how someone like this could sleep well at night. Also this person pretends to be a very religious person. At this point I have recovered in my career from that back stabbing, however, under no circumstances could I forgive that type of behavior.",

I immediately called him when I read it. His wife answered and berated me for a few minutes. I told her to go fuck herself and hung up. An hour later a mutual friend called and asked what is up with Mark. I asked why he needs to know and he said Mark posted more garbage. He has been hiding from me for the last 5 years.

The company needed to improve our financials for a new banking opportunity, so he sold a plan to the CEO to lay off about 60-70 employees, have mid level mgmt take a 10% pay cut and 20% for C-levels. In actuality, the bank deal was already done and what he really wanted to do was double his own salary and the CEO's for going along with the plan. That wasn't enough for him though, he also convinced his benefits to be covered 100% for him and his family, despite no other C-levels getting that treatment, he had a side business for temp accounting staffing that he unnecessarily had working for the company, all so he could generate more revenue for his own business at a ridiculous upcharge rate. He considered 3% annual raises to only be in \"exceptional cases\", in his own words, the person had to do something to increase the value of the department to get the full 3%, otherwise he'd only give them 1-2% which doesn't even keep up with inflation. Lastly and to top it all off, he framed a VP to get them fired to hire one of his friends in that role. This resulted in a lawsuit against the company and luckily the termed VP won and got a couple years of pay out of it, but nothing happened to the CFO. He would be demeaning, condescending and would make employees cry in department meetings. He fostered a culture of silence and throwing each other under the bus. He is a god tier asshole and has zero integrity. If he died tomorrow in a fiery car crash that involved sulfuric acid slowly melting him while the fire burns him...it still wouldn't match the suffering he's inflicted on so many lives, but at least he'd be gone from this world and the world would be better off.",

That worked well, and we were all friends for years until he underwent a radical political shift. He became very argumentative and demanded everyone change their behavior and speech to accommodate his new beliefs and snapped at people if they said something he disagreed with or joked about one of his sacred cow topics. Every hang out became walking on eggshells to see what he'd blow up about this time.\n\nI'm on the opposite side of the political spectrum from him, so much of his new behavior was directed at me and he kept not so subtlety hinting he expected me to either change everything I believe in (or at least never say anything he disagreed with) or he planned to force a \"him or me\" ultimatum on the group, and that he'd break contact with anyone who chose me. I refused to be bullied by him but I knew he was planning to portray the whole thing as my fault for breaking up the group, even though he was the one who couldnt keep his opinions to himself. \n\nThe thing is, at the time, I genuinely didnt know how the whole thing would go if he forced the point. Most of us had known each other longer than any of us have known him, but several in the group were more closely aligned with his beliefs than mine. so I didn't know if they'd choose their friendship with me over their ideological alignment with him, and if those few did, if the others would decide to split and stay with me, or decide kicking me was worth keeping most of the group together.\n\nUltimately he forced the point, but fortunately the entire group sided with me, leaving him to never talk to us again. Even so, i can tell some of the group still resent me for not just caving to his demands and forcing them to make the choice. Even years later, I  still hate him for trying to hold my friendships over my head and threatening to break them up because he decided politics were more important than friends, and making me live in the anxiety that I might lose some or all of my friends because of him for months.",

I\u2019ve always been the guy that made other people\u2019s problems my own and tried to help. My ex\u2019s parents would make comments about how I\u2019d worshipped the ground they\u2019d daughter walked on. So I wasn\u2019t violent, abusive or anything like that. Just delusional my schizophrenia kicked in at about 20\u2019s. I never hurt anyone but my delusions basically created mind games for me and everyone around me. It\u2019s easy to forgive myself as I\u2019ve taken steps to get right as soon as I realized something was wrong. However I lost alot good people, good connections, I\u2019ve lost alot of opportunities. When I finally got the help I needed life definitely changed however it seems as tho it\u2019s to late to repair what could of been. So starting fresh is nice however it\u2019s missing that long connection that makes the past real. It  seem like I wasn\u2019t even apart if it,  as much as I actually wasn\u2019t.",

A disgusting, prideful, arrogant, liar, mistreating and I would dare to say, dangerous person.\n\nHe came in the first time asking for me to do a job we don't do, and after a minute, he went \"do you have the brains to do it?\". What a shithead. He went into the working area, no customers allowed, he critizised everything you did for him, he belittled you, he was a grammar nerd, but in a sense that he would put you down when you spell wrong a completely unreal and long word. Hands behind his back, like the captain if a ship, where everyone is his servant.\n\nAfter my boss left the place(who took over for with this shithead, thankfully), and this pest guy left for a while to look for some other stuff, I was left to deal with giving him the finished product(which we shouldn't have done) he asked for.\n\nAs he returned he blatantly and saw me and demandingly asked, as I was clearly finishing, \"Am I going to have to wait much longer?\". That was it, I was done with this, specially since my boss encouraged me to be more assertive. I gave this mf his things and told him to fuck off and that he was a poece of shit.\n\nHe returned days later, asking to do the same job as before. He seemed to have \"left things behind\". But I didn't and I won't. I told off him again and he started arguing again. I had the highground, since I will refuse to attend a shit client.\n\nThis man, whom I don't even know his name, has been in the shop before, always asking for the dumbest shit ever. I have made my task to refuse service to this specimen.\n\nThis is a very summed up version of my problem with this guy, but rest assured, if this man was dropped in a dangerous hood, he would come out of in a coffin, he'd definitely piss the wrong person off.",

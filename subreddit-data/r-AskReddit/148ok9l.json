I don\u2019t know how someone like this could sleep well at night. Also this person pretends to be a very religious person. At this point I have recovered in my career from that back stabbing, however, under no circumstances could I forgive that type of behavior.",

I immediately called him when I read it. His wife answered and berated me for a few minutes. I told her to go fuck herself and hung up. An hour later a mutual friend called and asked what is up with Mark. I asked why he needs to know and he said Mark posted more garbage. He has been hiding from me for the last 5 years. I  still want to choke the shit out of him.",

The company needed to improve our financials for a new banking opportunity, so he sold a plan to the CEO to lay off about 60-70 employees, have mid level mgmt take a 10% pay cut and 20% for C-levels. In actuality, the bank deal was already done and what he really wanted to do was double his own salary and the CEO's for going along with the plan. That wasn't enough for him though, he also convinced his benefits to be covered 100% for him and his family, despite no other C-levels getting that treatment, he had a side business for temp accounting staffing that he unnecessarily had working for the company, all so he could generate more revenue for his own business at a ridiculous upcharge rate. He considered 3% annual raises to only be in \"exceptional cases\", in his own words, the person had to do something to increase the value of the department to get the full 3%, otherwise he'd only give them 1-2% which doesn't even keep up with inflation. Lastly and to top it all off, he framed a VP to get them fired to hire one of his friends in that role. This resulted in a lawsuit against the company and luckily the termed VP won and got a couple years of pay out of it, but nothing happened to the CFO. He would be demeaning, condescending and would make employees cry in department meetings. He fostered a culture of silence and throwing each other under the bus. He is a god tier asshole and has zero integrity. If he died tomorrow in a fiery car crash that involved sulfuric acid slowly melting him while the fire burns him...it still wouldn't match the suffering he's inflicted on so many lives, but at least he'd be gone from this world and the world would be better off.",

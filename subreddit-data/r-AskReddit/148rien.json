I was pretty upset about coming in on the weekends.\n\nThey also asked my co worker to come in. I asked her why she's here because she knows nothing about what I'm doing and she does something else. She said the bosses said \"it wouldn't be fair for \\[myname\\]\" so they asked her to come in too like asking her to come in is going to make me feel better wtf. Either pay me for saturday (I'm salary) or give me a day off to compensate me for the lost personal time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy the fuck did they tell her to come in because it's unfair for me.",

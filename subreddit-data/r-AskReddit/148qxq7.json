But everyone was hooking up with each other to the point where I would have called it incestuous. Because at the height of it my boss slept with my ex-girlfriend soon after he slept with my mother. So by six degrees of separation my mother technically slept with me. And several things happen like that across several different people and circles of friends. Luckily most of the time I was first in the door for that kind of thing.\n\nOtherwise it was the best job I've ever had honestly",

I miss the days when Star Wars felt like a labor of love and not just a profit-driven venture. While there have been enjoyable moments in the new films, I can't help but feel that something has been lost in the process. I long for the days when the Star Wars universe was guided by a singular vision, and each installment felt like a true continuation of the saga.",

I made it 20 minutes into the second watch of TLJ and couldn't do it.\n\nThe Mandalorian was more like the other movies and I like it quite a bit.  Andor was excellent, BoBF was ok and Obi-wan was awful.",

But overall I think it\u2019s been more good than bad. \n\nThe Star Wars sequels were mostly a miss (I personally loved The Last Jedi and don\u2019t get the hate behind it) but we also got Rogue One, The Mandalorian, and Andor from Disney. All of which are some of the best Star Wars stuff ever made in my opinion. \n\nI\u2019d argue we\u2019ve gotten more good things out of Star Wars from Disney than bad things.",

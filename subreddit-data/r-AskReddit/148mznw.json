They would show streets in your towns or major state or interstate hiways that took you you from one town to the next. You had to know where north was so that you could properly orient the maps.",

Maps existed and you knew how to read them, or people talked to strangers, and those strangers gave directions like turn your brontosaurus right at the red barn then left at the next intersection then go straight for a spell and you'll see a big house in the left turn just after that. \n\nAlso we got lost a lot which was kinda fun cause everyone got lost sometimes so it was just expected and sometimes led to great adventures. Other times your brontosaurus died cause you couldn't find food in time.",

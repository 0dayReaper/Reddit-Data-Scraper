I know the the anxiety and the depression aren't me, but they are a part of me. For the last 6 months it's been the worst it's ever been, after many years of happiness.\n\nMild social anxiety makes me sweat, particularly down my back. My mind darts from panic to panic but my outward reaction is undetectable unless you see my sweat marks. My heart feels like it's sinking and I deliberately, but unconsciously, 'repress' my breath, so I take in less air and release it more slowly, as if not to be heard breathing. I think this comes from having uncontrolled asthma for many years when I was young, and parents who would tell me off for having a wheeze.\n\nAnxiety spirals are harder to notice. They go hand in hand with the depression and they don't come out of nowhere, so I'm usually in a low mood worrying about X, Y and Z before I realise what's actually happening. The best way I can describe it is it's like going past the event horizon. I'm already lost before I consciously notice that I'm in a bad place and won't easily be able to get out of it. These are happening more frequently recently and I'm trying to keep a relationship alive, friendships fulfilling, my job secure and a plan to start a family afloat and it's becoming harder and harder.",

I can feel my chest move, but I can't feel any oxygen getting in. My hands and feet start to tingle and go numb due to the hyperventilation, and that makes me think for at least a moment that I am going to faint or that I'm going to die. My throat becomes completely dry and it hurts to breathe because it just feels as though I can't get enough air. I feel practically frozen because all I'm trying to do is breathe, and I feel like I can't move.\n\nThat's typically the point when I either let someone know that I'm having a panic attack, or if I'm in the middle of talking to someone and it happens (because if I tell someone I'm feeling this way, it generally kick-starts it completely), that's when they realise and try to help. But even as I start calming down from it, my head starts to feel even lighter at first, like I'm floating, however that's the feeling of calm that I need washing over me, even if it temporarily makes me dizzier than during the panic attack. \n\nAfter the panic attack subsides, I'm basically just a trembling mess and my throat is dry to the point where it's painful. I can still feel my heart hammering away, but I can keep my breathing controlled and slow so that I don't fall back into the spiral.\n\nAnd sometimes, even when I'm not having a panic attack, if I start worrying about something, my stomach gets filled with those butterflies and my head hurts because it feels like too many thoughts are in there and my brain is about to explode. That kind is a bit easier to manage by talking to my friends.\n\nAnxiety is different for everyone, though, and this is just my personal experience of it, and I hope that if any of y'all have anxiety or panic attacks, that you can learn how to cope and manage them.",

Sometimes I honestly feel like I\u2019m going to die because there is a sharp pain in my chest or side, which always goes away just fine but still causes the same amount of worry anyways.\nSometimes it\u2019s loud noises or being in a social environment(not to be confused with being introverted). It\u2019d be surprising to hear im actually a pretty extroverted person, I grew up this way. But sometimes, just out of the blue, my anxiety flares. And it feels like if I have to make eye contact or engage in conversation one more time I WILL EXPLODE. It really feels like a time bomb in your body and that the longer you\u2019re in that social environment, the more you know the clock is closer to 0. \n\nThen there\u2019s my background anxiety. I honestly hate this one almost as much as the phantom chest pains. They seem to have no trigger and just flare up for no reason. I call them background anxiety\u2019s because unlike the other ones, they\u2019re not mental but rather physical. Most of the time they will happen mid-conversation: a perfectly fine, no hostility, friendly conversation that is completely normal and in no way should make me defensive. Nevertheless my body thinks otherwise. I can\u2019t count the amount of times where I\u2019ve had to cut an interesting and awesome conversation short because my body decided mid-conversation \u201cok let\u2019s give his face this burning sensation and make his tear ducts go on overdrive.\u201d I tried a couple times to talk through this symptom but usually when the first tear comes down on a topic about golf they\u2019re usually like \u201cdude are u okay? What happened?\u201d\n\nAnother background anxiety I also get for some reason is when I\u2019m driving, I will be jamming to the radio having the chillest vibe known to man, then suddenly my body goes against my mind and decides to throw some anxiety in there. This one sucks because I will be driving and my eyes will just randomly start having an intense burning sensation. Half the time I have to pull over and pray it doesn\u2019t happen on the highway because I have about 2 minutes before I can\u2019t open my eyes at all, and if I do it\u2019s for 2 millisecond and too blurry from all the tears.\n\nThere\u2019s many other times where anxiety has ruined parts of my life. I wish I could say there\u2019s an easy way out, but after dealing with anxiety for years and gotten to know its many different types, I realized everyone has to learn to handle it differently. For me, it was fixing my insecurities and taking a break from my vices. I went from skinny and working a job at 20 years old as a janitor to exercising and pursuing a lifelong dream of mine of attending college. I also cut back on the weed and alcohol which seemed to help just as much, tremendously actually. Although I never thought I ever could get off weed, as I bettered myself through education and exercise I began to realize the vicious cycle I was in: anxiety, weed to help with anxiety, weed causes more anxiety, repeat. And with much more to lose(college and my body) for the first time I actually believed I could quit, and I did. I still have a long road ahead but it\u2019s getting better.\n\nAnyways, what does anxiety feel like to me? \nIt depends which type you\u2019re talking about.",

I will start fidgeting with my fingers and instinctively I will sort of curl up, hunch over, cross my legs, anything to make myself feel smaller. I never realize I am doing these things.\nI\u2019ve dealt with anxiety for as long as I can remember and a few years ago started on medication and have been going to therapy.

I know the the anxiety and the depression aren't me, but they are a part of me. For the last 6 months it's been the worst it's ever been, after many years of happiness.\n\nMild social anxiety makes me sweat, particularly down my back. My mind darts from panic to panic but my outward reaction is undetectable unless you see my sweat marks. My heart feels like it's sinking and I deliberately, but unconsciously, 'repress' my breath, so I take in less air and release it more slowly, as if not to be heard breathing. I think this comes from having uncontrolled asthma for many years when I was young, and parents who would tell me off for having a wheeze.\n\nAnxiety spirals are harder to notice. They go hand in hand with the depression and they don't come out of nowhere, so I'm usually in a low mood worrying about X, Y and Z before I realise what's actually happening. The best way I can describe it is it's like going past the event horizon. I'm already lost before I consciously notice that I'm in a bad place and won't easily be able to get out of it. These are happening more frequently recently and I'm trying to keep a relationship alive, friendships fulfilling, my job secure and a plan to start a family afloat and it's becoming harder and harder.",

I pity myself for lowering my standards and for causing so much self harm, no one deserved all that trauma! \n\nBy Allahs grace the last time he did that was after a series of ghosting session and I took hold of my life, but ne month I distracted myself with all possible things and Alhamdolillah with the help of Allah detached myself and made myself so much stronger that the same place last year, in which I begged him to come on camera and see just once and hum telling me I\u2019m rendering his phone to no use, him telling me how I\u2019m bothering hum and how he will block me in the last platform if I force him to show him NYC, this same place in which I used to beg hum to see, the same place doesn\u2019t give me a bit of love or excitement in showing him anything. The guy broke every single wish of mine and a heart full of love for years just to satisfy his ego \n\nAlhamdolillah, never will I attach myself to people again, it\u2019s not worth it, not him not anyone. \n\nWas only possible due to Allahs kind help, who made me stronger and gave me ability to let go off people who never loved me, never reciprocated the love, never respected me. I love myself and Im never going to have fears which will make people take advantage of my weakness, I\u2019ll never get attacked to people \n\nThankful to Allah almighty that I don\u2019t have any depression or anxiety attacks anymore, I overcame all my fears and let go off everyone who gave me anxiety",

I can feel my chest move, but I can't feel any oxygen getting in. My hands and feet start to tingle and go numb due to the hyperventilation, and that makes me think for at least a moment that I am going to faint or that I'm going to die. My throat becomes completely dry and it hurts to breathe because it just feels as though I can't get enough air. I feel practically frozen because all I'm trying to do is breathe, and I feel like I can't move.\n\nThat's typically the point when I either let someone know that I'm having a panic attack, or if I'm in the middle of talking to someone and it happens (because if I tell someone I'm feeling this way, it generally kick-starts it completely), that's when they realise and try to help. But even as I start calming down from it, my head starts to feel even lighter at first, like I'm floating, however that's the feeling of calm that I need washing over me, even if it temporarily makes me dizzier than during the panic attack. \n\nAfter the panic attack subsides, I'm basically just a trembling mess and my throat is dry to the point where it's painful. I can still feel my heart hammering away, but I can keep my breathing controlled and slow so that I don't fall back into the spiral.\n\nAnd sometimes, even when I'm not having a panic attack, if I start worrying about something, my stomach gets filled with those butterflies and my head hurts because it feels like too many thoughts are in there and my brain is about to explode. That kind is a bit easier to manage by talking to my friends.\n\nAnxiety is different for everyone, though, and this is just my personal experience of it, and I hope that if any of y'all have anxiety or panic attacks, that you can learn how to cope and manage them.",

I don't know what the actual reason for it is but I'll start holding my wrist and neck.\n\nIf I'm stressed about about something like a project I forgot to finish I get really jumpy, can't sit still and my head is a mess. I can't focus on anything and my head is in pure chaos, since I have this very regularly I always listen to music. Especially metal and really energetic music like touhou help. Worst case I shoot into panic and then I'm just running around without a purpose and can't do anything.\n\nIf I have to do something like public speaking I just start feeling unwell. Like I have a bad fever (talking 39-40 degrees) and want to puke. Nothing really helps this so I avoid it at all costs.",

I could not go to work for a week when that started. My parents took me to a regular doctor. Mom said I was experiencing nerves. This happened after my divorce which is strange because I wanted the divorce and there was never much of a marriage. We were roommates basically.\nThe fear went away with medication but I began to have physical symptoms. And darn it if it didn't always happen in a staff meeting! Tingling starting from my head and down my arms. Nausea that turned into a dry cough. Would have to leave the room to heave in the bathroom. Mouth would fill with saliva. Had to spit and spit until it would stop. Embarrassing when someone came looking for me in the bathroom. \nIt wasn't the divorce, it was the stress of my father in law having and dying from cancer. The daily visit at the hospital or rehab center he was at. My husband pressuring me to meet him there daily at the hospital. And for what? To be ignored by him. And if I didn't show up, I got the silent treatment at home. Very stressful time. I divorced him 6 months after my father in law died.\nThese physical anxiety attacks went away and it took years. My body and mind needed peace.",

Case in point: Thanks to the awful information filtering out there, I had a patient just last week who read that Vitamin D helps you resist a Coronavirus infection.  Well, he had also read that you can get more Vitamin D by getting more sun.  So he wanted to \"collect\" as much light as possible with his eyes.  As a result, he stared at the sun for a solid 60 seconds and burned holes directly into his retinas permanently reducing his vision with no chance at future improvement.",

They were babysitting my 1 and 3 year old during the last solar eclipse and before I left I asked them to not let the kids look at the eclipse because it can hurt their eyes.  I mentioned it because I could see them thinking the eclipse was cool and showing the kids.  \n\nInstead they got all serious and said they'd been watching the news and they keep saying how strong the sun will be during the eclipse so they had already decided to keep the blinds closed all day and not let the kids go near the windows because they were afraid they'd get sunburns inside if the sun was going to be that strong.",

This meant if you arrived in time, your punch would read 8:50. \nThe manager of the department assigned time keeping to another person, because he knew he didn\u2019t understand it. After several weeks of everyone punching in at 8:50, we all got called in for it. \nFirst of all, we were all salaried, except one person, so the time didn\u2019t really matter in terms of the law. But it kept the peace, so no one complained. \nWe all got ripped up one side and down the other, and no one was allowed to speak. Not that any of them tried, except me. \nWhen the manager and the time keeper finally shut up, I pointed out that the clock runs on 100 minutes, not 60, so therefore we were all on time, or early. \nThey stood dumbfounded when they looked at the clock and it literally showed an analog clock with 100 minutes. \nSo then I took it further to point out that as salaried employees, none of this matters, and that none of us ever left for much, giving them 9 hours instead of 8. And that they walk in at 8:30 and we are already there, so how could we really be arriving at 8:50? \n\nThey understood, and removed the stipulation that salaried employees need to use the time clock.",

For example:\n\nIn-8:00 - Out-4:30       -      8:50\n\nThat means you clocked in at 8am, clocked out at 4:30pm and worked a total of 8.5 hours that day.

I recognized immediately that he got a pretty poor score. When I mentioned to him that I didn't think it was a very good score, he confidently proclaimed: \n\n\"But it says I'm smarter than 15% of Juniors, and I'm only a sophomore!\"\n\nTo which I rebutted: \n\n\"Yeah, but imagine the DUMBEST 15% of people. That's not very good.\"",

            "comment": "I once was working at a Renaissance Festival in South Florida. I was just barely 21- had gone down there for the winter to help out a musician friend, and was living a very frugal lifestyle. I don't think I even had a debit card at that point, and my cell phone was pay-per-text at like $.10 a message. \n\nSo anyway- I would totally get paid for booth-sitting for some artists after the weekend- but by Friday, I was pretty broke. I had about $7 in gold dollar coins- because that's what I liked to keep on me at faire to give out as change. I had the remains of the $20 I'd taken in coins, and other than that, I didnt have any other cash. \n\nWe had a kid's day at faire- where schools bring kids on school trips, and so I needed to grab some food and get back to Deerfield Beach Park. So fully dressed in Renaissance garb, I ran into the Taco Bell.  I figured my cash would go the farthest there.  I ordered my food, and when I went to pay, the girl behind the counter LAUGHS and goes; \n\n\"Uh- no. I need REAL money.\" \n\nI looked at her, confused. \"These ARE real money, they are gold Sacajawea dollars...\" \n\n\"Yeah, we only take US cash here. I need actual money to pay for the food.\" \n\nNow the line behind me is getting antsy- but the girl at the register is getting really bitchy and I'm like - what the fuck do you do when a business WONT take your payment. It wasn't like I was trying to pay in nickels. I had $4.-- worth of food and tried giving her $5 in coins. \n\nI'm like, \"This is all I've got on me... I don't know what to tell you- but it IS legal US tender- see right here?\" And I'm trying to show her the coins- and shes yelling like im trying to pay her in monopoly money. \n\nThe guy behind me was like \"yeah, those are real coins\"- but I don't think he wanted her ire turned towards him- so he wasn't very forceful. I asked if she could get a manager and she was like, \"I ain't gonna waste his time with this bullshit. You either pay in real money, or leave\" and she's grabbed my bag of food so I can't go anywhere. \n\nI take out my wallet- remembering the two lucky $2 bills I had carried for YEARS- folded up in the back pocket. I unfolded those- and she takes one look at the $2 bills... And I'm sure you can predict what happened. She BLEW UP. \n\nNext thing I know- she's screaming for the staff to call the cops and telling ME not to go anywhere because I'm trying to rip her off and pass off all this \"fake money\" and she \"gon see my ass to jail!\" - meanwhile, I'm hungry, tired, and now very very irritated- and that's when a cop car pulls up. \n\nThey weren't responding to the call- I don't even know if the store HAD called. I was ready to walk out, nearly in tears - when the two cops come in and all eyes turn to them. There's about ten people now in line behind me- and everyone turns to look at the cops who very clearly have a \"wtf is going on- I just stopped to get food\" look on thier faces. \n\nThat's when the obnoxious register girl, and two co-workers she called over- start waving my money around (that was the best part- she took my money and was refusing to give it back OR to give me my food)- and the cops go to the counter to figure out what she's freaking out over. At this point, the manager heard the commotion and joins the two guys and the register girl. The three teenager employees are all going on and on about \"the girl in the costume trying to give them fake money tryna rip them off\"- and the cops VERY quickly put an end to that. \n\nThe one cop holds up the two $2 bills, and my gold dollar coins- and he tells the staff that BOTH are- indeed- actual REAL money. The girl is still protesting- saying\"yeah but it's not America money and we only take America money.\"- when the manager finally realized what happened and apologized- telling the teenagers - who look to be completely in disbelief - that yes, the coins AND bills are BOTH really, United States money. \n\nThe manager offers to personally remake my meal- and the cops as well - apologizing for everything. I'm REALLY late at this point, and I didn't really trust them to make my food, even if the manager was being really nice- but the cop said\"I tell you what- I'll come back and get your info while you make our food. How about that?\" - so he accompanied the manager back white he washed his hands and made our food. \n\nThe other cop gave me my money back, and took my info. As I was FINALLY leaving with my food- the guy behind me jokes with the cop \"I think I'm going to pay with a handful of half-dollars I've got in my car. What do you think?\" \n\nI was SO floored that anyone could be SO ignorant... And not just ignorant, but completely and utterly unwilling to realize or to recognize that they had made a mistake and were wrong. All she did was double down- insisting we were ALL wrong and I was just a thief. \n\nSO FRUSTRATING!",

As a brand new medic, I spent about 6 hours pulling fingermeat from the hedges.\n\nEdit: thanks for the award.\n\nUpdate: Sorry, I'm a Redderp and on a phone. For clarification, it was early 2004 after OIF1 in the 82nd. \n\nI was a PFC with only a year and a half in service. We bandaged him, then used tourniquet (temporarily). Senior medics took him to the ER. I was field sanitation qualified, so I was left in charge of cleanup. 6 hours was excessive, but after we pulled most the meat and bone out, we had to hose down the hedges, the ground, the grass he bled in, the ground/floor outside and inside where he left a decent amount of blood had to be rinsed and sterilized. The mower had to be rinsed and cleaned. It had some damage from the drop. The private that started the mower had to be smoked by his nco. We finished in about 4 hours of actual work with 2 hours of fucking off mixed in, cause the sham shield is the real deal.",

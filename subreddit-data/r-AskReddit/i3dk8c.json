This is generally not great, as there is a non-trivial portion of the population that can't afford to take that time unpaid.\n\nEven worse, if someone is working two jobs, those two employers don't need to coordinate to get the employee a voting window.\n\nThis is all further compounded by access to speedy voting. In more populous areas, lines at voting centers can take hours. This has gotten worse recently as voting locations have been \"consolidated.\" So much so that in the primaries alone, voters in Texas waited over [six hours in line to vote.](https://www.texasobserver.org/lines-wait-vote-texas-primary-2020/) Presidential election day is looking to be worse.\n\nIt's not easy to convince someone who can't afford to miss a day of work to make that sacrifice.",

The majority of people used to make a living in agriculture and since most didn\u2019t live in cities but rather rural areas it would take 1 day to get to their voting place. Sunday was seen as impractical since everyone went to mass and Wednesday was market day for farmers. So Tuesday was picked as it was seen as the most convenient option. The fact it\u2019s in November also has to do with farm culture. Spring and summer and early fall were seen as impractical since that\u2019s when planting and harvesting take place. By November the harvest has been completed and it\u2019s not yet harsh winter whether. \n\nSo basically no it was not to deter voting, but now most people don\u2019t work in agriculture and I agree that it needs to be updated.",

I personally just get an uneasy feeling when I hear of someone that's been in office for 30+ years. But again, that is how our system works and I fully understand that.  Even if the term limits were 10 years or however long, personally, I would like to see the end of lifelong politicians. Not that they are all bad, but new blood breeds new ideas. And saying the next voted in politician would have no experience is not true, nor does it really matter either. Sarah Palin was a housewife that turned mayor because she spoke up about the corruption in her local government. She did so well as a mayor she won a governor's seat. Political experience can come from anywhere.",

The average lifespan of any nation's constitution is 17 years since 1789. I think if we can consistently update it as time goes on we would be okay, but as you said it needs a serious overhaul and I'm fearful that it is almost impossible to do at times. Sometimes I wonder if the US should rewrite it's constitution",

Polling is open from 7 to 9.  Your employer does not have to legally give you any time off since you have three consecutive hours in the morning.\n\nhttps://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-2.01/page-17.html\n\nFor most people the above rules are fine however, for those working lower pay retail jobs and relying on public transit they might not be.\n\nI am mixed on holiday voting since I personally don't think it solves the problem.  The only way it works is if it's on like a Wednesday so people don't just long weekend it. Also it needs to be mandatory as in all retail fast food ect are closed.\n\n[Edit: I actually missed the time requirement the Canadian laws have which is 3 consecutive hours between 830 to 830.  I will leave the above incorrect example up.  Personally I believe I have had employers in Canada violate this fairly easily and with impunity when I worked retail].",

Admittedly the land area we need to cover is a lot smaller than the US, and we make sure there's a lot of polling stations (they're usually in local primary schools) so realistically your polling station is never going to be more than about 10km (6ish miles) from where you live. Or rather from where you're registered to vote; if you forgot to re-register when you moved house, or went away for college or anything then yeah, you're in trouble as you might need to get from Dublin to fecking Donegal to vote, which is like a 5+ hour bus ride (since most university students here don't have cars). But I've known plenty who do it, just miss their afternoon lectures to get the bus that'll get them home before 10pm",

Taking off from work, at an hourly or tip-based job, means a loss of income, especially on a national holiday. \n\n\nGrocery stores, gas stations, and major retail stores will all being scheduling shifts, more than likely not accounting for when voting centers are open and their lines. Pandemic-essential services, and most of the entertainment/food/bev businesses that have been shutdown, it's all of those workers that will be left without the time to go out and vote. \n\n\nThink about what you would do with a day off. Get some groceries, maybe grab a lunch with some friends while you don't have to be at the office, vote, buy a mattress?, and then start the night with an early happy hour while watching the results come in. The service sector will still be expected to work, and will be incentized to forgo voting if it doesn't fit in with their work schedule.  \n\n\nUnless individual businesses and/or major companies decide to delay opening, stagger shifts, or close for the day, many workers will be left out of the voting window. I'm in full support of a voting holiday, and I understand that the country can't fully shut down, but as said above...it's not the panacea.",

You can enrol and vote at the same time. \n\nI cant believe America has an election on a Tuesday. That's absolutely insane!

If it was a holiday I\u2019d pretty much not be able to vote since I\u2019d be at work all day, when currently I just go in the early morning before my shift starts. Meanwhile everyone in my family who has an office job that closes on federal holidays has always been able to leave the office in the middle of the day to go vote anyway and then just return to work. Perhaps mail in voting can remedy this for most people, but personally I just don\u2019t mail things that often so I\u2019d be paranoid that I made a mistake and my vote didn\u2019t count. When I vote in person my polling place has a machine that you immediately scan your ballot into in any direction, so you know it\u2019s there and accounted for.",

We still have to work 365 days a year. \n\nAnd the thing is many poor people work jobs that you don't get off for holidays. But schools would have off so they may have a harder time balancing work and finding a babysitter. And with people having the day off it may be even busier for stores and restaurants meaning less ability to let people get off early or get a break to go vote easily. \n\nThere is also an issue where it may give people the idea of yay a day off and instead of using it to vote they party, travel, do some type of activity or events and don't vote still lol",

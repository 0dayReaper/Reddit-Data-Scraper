You can be attracted to faces, butts, boobs, pecs, arms, hands, stomachs, necks, and legs but feet seems to be where people draw the line.\n\nI don\u2019t tend to kink shame in general unless it causes others harm but this one I find extra harmless.",

I've never had a woman say she thinks its weird. Instead, they like that I told them something specific that I enjoy because it makes for better love making.

They literally are just preferences about the aesthetics of certain body parts. \n\nFeet in particular is one of the most common, if not **the** most common \"unusual\" fetish around for guys.\n\nI can understand people finding it weird though, as most people with fetishes tend to be associated with creeps. Unfortunately, a lot of people learn about fetishes through the creepy weirdos acting in an inappropriate manner, and they end up associating everyone with a fetish to these people.\n\nLike, if a guy talks about having a foot fetish with someone, half of the time they will assume that thet either take creepshots, or want to sniff random women feet, or that they make very creepy and unwanted comments to women. Or, even worse, that they are attracted and sexually aroused by any girl who is barefoot around them. \n\nIt's mostly ignorance from people, and most guys with foot fetishes don't do any of that. They just have a kink, but it doesn't mean they don't know how to hold their penis in their pants.",

Granted, I DO like the look of those [extreme pointe fetish boots](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ef/92/14/ef92145a7b416ed8d148e2eba63e8e8a.jpg) even if they do make me wince at how painful they must be to wear.\n\nPersonally, give me a nice pair of lace up combat boots and I'm all yours. I can't actually wear stiletto spiked heels or Hell, heels in general but I CAN appreciate a lovely shoe. In that instance, it's not so much about the foot itself but the shoe: it turns something I don't really like into something pretty and aestheticly pleasing.\n\nI think once the bare feet are clean, don't stink to high heaven and are well groomed/manicured, that's not so bad. Just don't ask me to touch or massage them. Nope. Can't do it. Not today. Few things are more disgusting than overgrown sloth-like toenails. CLIP YOUR SHIT.",

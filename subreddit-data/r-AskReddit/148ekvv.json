I've never had a woman say she thinks its weird. Instead, they like that I told them something specific that I enjoy because it makes for better love making. I do the same for my partners, you like xyz? Sweet, let's get after it. \n\nCommunicate your interests. You'll be surprised how eager other people are to kink it out with you.",

Unfortunately, a lot of people learn about fetishes through the creepy weirdos acting in an inappropriate manner, and they end up associating everyone with a fetish to these people.\n\nLike, if a guy talks about having a foot fetish with someone, half of the time they will assume that thet either take creepshots, or want to sniff random women feet, or that they make very creepy and unwanted comments to women. Or, even worse, that they are attracted and sexually aroused by any girl who is barefoot around them. \n\nIt's mostly ignorance from people, and most guys with foot fetishes don't do any of that. They just have a kink, but it doesn't mean they don't know how to hold their penis in their pants.",

He constantly told me what he wanted me to do to him sexually with my feet. That\u2019s it. Wouldn\u2019t call me for anything else. Also had just gotten our homecoming photos back and he FaceTimes me saying, \u201cYou look pretty, but your feet look prettier.\u201d To this day I still feel effy when seeing my feet.",

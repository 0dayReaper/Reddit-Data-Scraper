I think it is actually very informative to see some of the violence that is a part of the daily lives of people in the middle east, for instance.\n\nThere's also a lot of \"gore\" that is scientifically or medically interesting (if not directly beneficial to your field), for instance. Like I remember during the Boston marathon bombing, a picture of a guy holding the artery closed of a dude who got his leg blown off. That was cool to know, and even helpful info should I ever get myself into a good old fashioned bombing scenario. There's also some surgeries that are gnarly but interesting, like a video I saw on here of a subdural hematoma surgery, where a dude's skull is cut open and taken off like a pringles can lid, then a giant mass of blood is water-gunned out of his head before his brain is cauterized with an iron.\n\nFinally, even some stuff on the old \"WatchPeopleDie\" subreddit was interesting in terms of what can happen for a variety of OSHA violations, or even just giving an appreciation of your life.",

I don't want to be scared when someone leg snaps in half and needs me. \n\nBut the shortened version of this answer is \"curiosity\", and there's a lot of people that don't get that.

It wasn't really the gore though--it was a scene where they're bringing aliens into a room one by one to kill them and they're visibly terrified, because they know they're about to die. It was a pretty intense movie that already had me upset but their terror and desperation and helplessness in that scene just broke me. \n\nI also walked out of Saving Private Ryan in a film history class I was in; it was during the D-Day scene and again it wasn't the gore itself but the desperation of the soldier crying for his mom while he lay dying.",

Mom was aware of the abuse and stayed with her husband anyway. It was a complicated situation, and it wasn\u2019t. How could she not do more to protect her daughter?!sorry lady... I\u2019m judging.",

Dad (AND stepdad) were in jail for sexually abusing all 3 kids, along with numerous drug charges &amp; DV. I texted the mom one day, like I always did, letting her know I was on my way &amp; received a text back, \u201cThis is ___, my mom died\u201d. Mom had a heart attack in the middle of the night &amp; died, kids just thought she was sleeping late &amp; laid in bed cuddling with her all day until a neighbor stopped by &amp; realized she was dead. \n\nAnyways shitty CPS systems.. even though there was an estranged family member who WANTED to take the kids, was in family services herself, had a great home &amp; could adequately provide, for once in their life, a healthy &amp; stable environment, they released bio dad from prison early so he could get custody. \n\nHe \u201cfired\u201d me the moment he got them. The kids would call me from their school\u2019s counselors office crying &amp; telling me horrific stories of what was going on &amp; of course I reported it to CPS over &amp; over. Eventually they told me they didn\u2019t want to hear it anymore, circumstances weren\u2019t changing &amp; to do myself a favor &amp; stop answering when the kids called...\n\nOver time the calls stopped, but not a day went (or still) goes by without worrying about them. Last fall I got a call at my now office from the girl...At not even 16, 3 pregnancies (all either aborted or miscarried), her dad pimped her out for years, made her sell drugs, she\u2019d done time in juvi.. you name it.\n\nWe fought CPS so long &amp; hard &amp; got NOTHING except that life for those kids. I was so grateful she reached out to me! I\u2019ll never forget that case workers name &amp; pray I never run across her again",

He told this story with a blank face, smiling only when he recalled the \"good times\", which he referred to as times when he had enough heroin to get through the day. \n\nI'm not sure where he is at now, but this man inspired me to work with victims of sex trafficking, because not only do they deal with the stigma of \"selling their bodies\", they often manage drug addictions. People would honestly be floored of they realized how many people were addicted to chemicals that they were forcibly given.",

At least not an identified one. \n\nI did run a men\u2019s anger management group though, and some of those men had done some terrible things to women. Most of them I found ways to like and admire for their positive aspects, but there were two guys in that group I just could never find \u201cunconditional positive regard\u201d for. One guy basically never spoke in group. He would give one word answers and occasionally just discuss how unfair the \u201csystem\u201d was to him. I worked really hard to open him up and find things to connect over but he never opened up to me or the group. He left the group after he strangled his girlfriend and went to jail. She survived thankfully. \n\nThe other left group early routinely, showed up late, participated minimally and similarly never wanted to open up honestly. He left early one group after we had discussed him staying to the end and threatened me when I told him he wasn\u2019t going to get credit for attendance (something the court required). Oddly, I eventually moved into the apartment below him (completely without knowledge) and listened to him scream at his girlfriend and break shit while I called the cops. \n\nI judge these men. They\u2019re shitty. Maybe they\u2019re redeemable, but redemption requires self-exploration and they both refused to do so. It\u2019s worth noting how differently I felt about them than so many others in the group; men I found ways to help and admire and respect even in spite of their awful behavior in the past.",

If someone says, \"You're angry with me!\" Or something to that effect, ask yourself if you really are. If you're not actually angry, then don't spend a second more on it. A lot of kids/family members get hung up on trying to justify their own actions according to someone else's perception.\n\n\nEdit 3: fixed straitjacket spelling.

I was trained in behavioral intervention techniques for children and was off helping coach parents to support children with behavior disorders. \n\nI'll say this, I rarely encountered a child that had a clear mental illness in the same way as when I worked with adults with serious mental illness. In many ways, they were visibly confused or lonely. Given that most of their parents were suffering from poverty, alleviating the burdens of being poor would have likely mitigated the most severe symptoms of many of the children. Advocating for affordable childcare and livable minimum wages is mental health advocacy.\n\nI found myself judging, not the children, but their parents. Some parents would drop the kids off with me and peace out with a, \"fix my kid\" attitude. As a parent, now, I get some of it; exhaustion and burnout are real. But the best I could do in that situation was provide that kid with an hour long vision of what it looks like to live in a loving, structured environment. Those kids were the ones I could tell who were much more likely to be subject to the \"system\" for the duration of their lives. Either cycles of institutionalization and homelessness or prison.\n\nWhen a concerned parent showed up and asked, \"how do I help my kid?\" I practically jumped for joy for the child because they had someone who loved them and was fighting for them.",

You have to have unconditional positive regard or you'll never achieve therapeutic rapport.  \n\nI think for me, the one that comes to mind is a frequent caller to the suicide hotlines.  He'd call in and say he's not providing his phone number or name, he would just say that you had 10 seconds to convince him not to kill himself over the phone, or he'd blow his brains out and it'd be your fault.  Then he'd count down from 10 to 1 while you're on the phone talking.  At one, he'd hang up.\n\nI'm sure the whole point was to make me feel bad or prove some point, I don't know, I have insufficient information to make an assessment with just that. But I have to admit when I was trying to sleep on days he'd call, especially the first time, I was thinking, \"fucking asshole better not be dead, fucker...\"",

It's good to have a neutral 3rd party weigh in on what troubles you. \n\nAnd remember, you dont have to stay with a therapist if you dont want. Therapy, like any psychological treatment, is often more about trial and error to find what works for the individual than anything.  Also, you'll get out of it what you put in, so be upfront, Frank and honest with your therapist. That will help them work with you on determining the best therapy course for you. \n\nI wish you the best of luck.",

I was talking to a friend about my recent therapy session, and she very wisely pointed out that she thought my therapist was a great fit, because \u201cshe challenges you.\u201d\n\nI asked what she meant, and she talked about a mutual (now ex) friend who was also going to therapy, whose therapist was more of a \u201cbuddy to complain to\u201d instead of working through your problems. Turns out, the friend had proudly divulged that one session, they didn\u2019t like the questions the therapist asked so instead of interacting, they spent the entire rest of the session staring out the window and full-on stonewalling the poor lady. I never knew that, and made me really WTF. You\u2019re wasting your money, and the time of the both of you if you don\u2019t just go head-first into the situation. Therapists, *good* therapists, love helping solve your problems and listen to you to understand why things are going wrong. I personally think it was kind of shitty for my friend\u2019s therapist to let them get away with that kind of behavior, but there was a clear pattern of weaponizing their own emotions against people who cared about them, so I wasn\u2019t surprised.\n\nIf my therapist even SMELLS I\u2019m downplaying or telling half-truths, she stops everything she\u2019s doing to weasel it out of me lol. I\u2019ll go through 4 or 5 \u201cgood enough\u201d answers for why I\u2019m feeling before I finally say whatever the real reason is- not because I\u2019m being intentionally obstinate, but I have a habit of doing it that\u2019s hard to break, or I need a moment to pause and *really* think on the reason. We really do play a verbal game of her trying to catch my weasely ass in a half-lie LOL.\n\nThat ability to push back on me until I give up the ghost is the reason my therapy has been so goddamn successful, as well as my own work put in to actively try to be as open as possible to the process. It fucking blows, *nobody* likes being upset or \u201cgoing\u201d to those really hard emotional places, but it *has* to be done. Not allowing that for yourself in the presence of a neutral third party will be a detriment to your journey.\n\nSo yeah. Shop for someone who challenges you just the right amount, and don\u2019t be afraid. I know it\u2019s been a good session when I come out feeling like I\u2019ve run a marathon and I\u2019m mentally dog cussing my therapist for dragging me through that, and I absolutely recommend that to EVERYONE to experience hahaha",

I know people don't take that stuff seriously, but it was so bad that i was later diagnosed with PTSD from a psychiatrist.\nAnywho, my abusive parents and i got in a verbal fight in the car. My stepdad stopped the car and told me \"get out we're leaving you on the highway\". I wasn't scared because i knew i could just call the police, say i was an abandoned child, and theyd get in loads of trouble, so i said \"sounds good\" and got out. My mom then came out and started attacking me. I refused to get back in the car after the attack, so my stepdad got out, dragged me by the hair, called me a \"bipolar bitch\", and threw me in.\nThey made me see a therapist, they told her that i jumped out of a moving car and then i attacked my mom when she was trying to help. This therapist didn't believe anything i said and tried getting me to take bipolar meds. I knew i wasn't bipolar, i was being abused and i knew that the anger and sadness i felt was normal for my situation. She glared at me and said \"you're not nearly as smart as you think you are\". I refused to say a word in any of our therapy sessions after that, i would just go in, sit down, and she'd make snarky sarcastic remarks for a few minutes then dismiss me. She wasn't trying to help me, she was trying to help my parents.\nI moved out when i was 18, went to college all on my own with no financial help from my family, got a job and left the country to be as far from them as possible. I'm on antidepressants for my PTSD and luckily the therapists ive had since my teenage years have been nothing like that horrible woman, but it still upsets me deeply thinking about it.",

It allows for a more oxidation resistant steel, meaning theoretically less post heat processing. I believe it also allows for a higher hardness than traditional carbon steels. The problem previously was the volatility of nitrogen not allowing enough saturation, however adding chromium and pressurising a nitrogen atmosphere have allowed manufacturers to get up to 3% mass. Unfortunately the chromium required makes pretty much all high nitrogen steel stainless, which is always more difficult to work with.\n\nThe reason there was a new article to read, was that apparently through particle metallurgy and static pressure, people have made a more simple alloy like you can find in plain carbon steels. Which could mean a replacement of carbon in most steel, instead of just high chromium stainless. It probably won't, but it could. And I like that thought.",

            "comment": "I've spent my fair share of time in the ward, but I'm no therapist.  There's an understanding that we're all a little fucked up in there so we really try not to judge each other (Most of us, anyways.) but every once in a while you get those people who are just....a different level of crazy.\n\nNow, I was on the ward for a suicide attempt, and it wasn't exactly a secret, you can usually pick out within the first few minutes who's there for finding the end of their rope and who's there because it's better'n jail.  But then there are the ones who are there because there is no safer place for them to be, and you're usually lucky to see them because they spend most of their time isolated and doped.  \n\nWell, I was lucky enough to meet one of them right before he got doped and isolated.  He was such a nice guy that I assumed he was an attempter, like me.  You tend to find a lot of the best qualities in people after they've tried to end their life.  With this gentleman, that was very much the case; I saw the best in him.  \"Can I take your plate for you?\" (We have to tell him no, you're not supposed to be anything except self-sufficient on the ward.) \n\n\"Can I do your laundry for you?\"\n\n\"Can I wash these dishes before we send them back to the cafeteria?\"\n\nA lot of this was going on, and after 3 days of it, it was definitely becoming apparent that his typical concoction of meds had fully worn off and he was getting snippy about it.  Well, my first experience with extreme bipolar disorder went a little like this:\n\n\"May I sit next to you?  I'm a little tense and would love a conversation to get my mind off of it.\"\n\n\"Sure thing, B.  I'm gonna finish this pudding and put a show on, what would you like to watch?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing.  Hey have you ever tried to hurt yourself?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I have, it's why I'm in here.\"\n\n\"Why didn't it work?\"\n\n\"Well, I stopped myself and drove here after I caught a glimpse of what it would do to my dad if he found me.\"\n\n\"I see.  Well, they won't let me have anything in my room but watch this.\" *He hands me the end of a long strand of toilet paper* \"You hold that end and just watch.\"\n\nNow as I'm holding it I already have this idea in my head that this guy is actively trying to hurt himself, so I'm a bit curious to see what he's doing, but I'm also a bit paranoid that he may have given up on hurting himself and is now targeting someone else.  But as I sit there watching him twist this toilet paper and fold it in on itself, I recognize what he's created as the start of a noose and it dawns on me.  *He's trying to teach me how to hang myself.* \n\nI still think about that guy.  I wonder what he's like day-to-day when he's \"regular.\"  All I ever saw was this overly exuberant bubbly personality which was tailored to make people think he wasn't as crazy as he really was.  He hurt a couple of nurses that night and the day after his noose creation, he was isolated to his room for the remainder of my stay.",

            "comment": "I work in mental health and have worked in acute and crisis settings for the majority of my career. The most notable event I experienced was when a young person had presented with significant ongoing suicidal ideation who was dealing with a lot of shit. I spent a lot of time with them mostly deescalation and working out what the plan should be moving forward. \n\nOne of their parents came in a little while later and I had the opportunity to speak to them about where their child was and what had been going on, with their consent of course. Midway through me trying to explain some of the psychological constructs and ways the parent could help they said to me, \"is this going to take much longer I have a show to go and watch\".\n\nAll I can say is, I never judge my patients, I have never walked their path or viewed the world through their eyes. But the people around them who perpetuate the suffering of the people I work with through ignorance, malice and selfishness, I judge them.\n\nEdit and a shameless one. I've tried to reply to as much as I could, I've enjoyed some of what I would assume is trolling and talking about some other people's experiences as it's given me a chance to reflect on some of my own stuff. But I must go to bed. \n\nI'd like to ask one thing of anyone who reads this, remember that you can help, even just by asking how someone is or wishing them well. People who you think may be struggling and even people who aren't. This year has been hard on us all, and I appreciate all of you who have said that those in care services have difficult jobs, but we have all struggled this year. Please be as kind as you can to each other and I hope we can all look forward to a good December and even better new year.\n\nEdit 2. My use of the word 'judge' needs some clarification, I do judge in some ways, it's hard not to with what I see, who I work with and the situations they experience or have experienced. What I mean by not judging is that I do not allow my judgements to distort what I am seeing or how I am working. Which will normally be to the benefit of the patient and those around them trying to help them achieve their goals and meet their needs.\n\nFinal edit. I didn't think this post would get as big as it has. And I cannot respond to every comment individually by any means. I'm sure the post will be getting less attention moving forward but I just wanted to clarify some things.\n\nThis parent, who many people have made multiple assumptions about, was not trying to redirect, deflect or remove themselves from the situation by stating they had a show to watch. The show being something else people have assumed was a TV show. Remember I've made the comment above in the context of a situation that lasted around 5 to 6 hours for me, but took you a few minutes to read.\n\nWith everything that's going on right now I wanted to make this post to let people know, those working in mental health have heard a lot, we don't judge you for how or what you're feeling and we want to work with you to help you. I simply wanted to help in some way with a comment on the Internet that I wrote in one go about an experience I have had. I know that the response to this has been overwhelmingly positive but I would also like to say I did not mean to cause any offence or upset to anyone or claim that I am some sort of unachievable goal of non-judgement. \n\nAnyway, I'm going to try and forget about this now.",

I don\u2019t feel anger toward the parents, mostly I feel bad for the kid.\n\nEdit: Wow. All I have to say is that I am incredibly humbled by all of you that have shared your stories.

The second time the therapist asked her to come in to talk to her about how I was feeling and she started crying to him about how my feelings made her feel sad and how much it affected her. I never even cried in my sessions. Then he told her she might like to consider letting me go out with friends more and have a better social life and then she took me home and told me I manipulated him into saying that to her. \n\nA few weeks later I tried to commit suicide and her response was to take me out of therapy and off the medication because in her mind that was what caused my episode and not her and my father being pricks to me.\n\nEdit: Jesus reddit I did not expect all these replies. I am totally out of this situation and do not live with or speak to my parents anymore. I cut them off relatively recently and am working through it, but seeing the outpouring of stories, kindness and love in this thread has truly made me feel heard and validated for the first time that she really was as bad as I remembered.

It took me many years after I cut her out before I saw a therapist again, after all the years she used those kind of skills against me. I had a serious distrust for therapy in general. \n\nI am super glad I gave it another go though. Been seeing the same therapist for 3 years now, and I consider her a vital part of my support structure.",

I had tried Suprax in the past, didnt like the side effects and put it down, but I was ready to try something new to supplement therapy. Everyone within earshot was calling Wellbutrin a miracle and life saver, so I figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nSince my therapist couldn't prescribe drugs, I got an appointment with a psychiatrist. My first appointment, I explain what I've got going on, what I'm doing to work on it, and what I'm looking for in seeing him.\n\nI do a pretty good job holding myself together in public. I dress myself, I hold down jobs, at that point I lived on my own (now living with my partner); all in all, I've got a well-polished mask. I guess it's too good, because pretty early in our session he looked at me and said, \"I don't think you're depressed.\"\n\nBro. This is the first time we met, I've been here for 20 mins, and you're ready to reverse my diagnosis? Cool bro.",

He just reach a point where he couldn't stand being ignore any longer so he had what she called a \"Fried Green Tomatoes\" moment.\n\nParents dismissed their responsability,only problem they saw was the wacked t.v. Kid got emancipated at 16 and moved to f*ck out of there.\n\nShe had a private practice and the only times she expressed any judgment was when someone seeked therapy but refused to do any work or partake in the process. Paying a therapist is not paying someone to agree with you. You need to show up, you need to -at least- try.",

For example, many twelve step programs leave no room for relapse. You relapse, you start over. Instead, relapse should be seen as part of the sobriety journey and more steps should be taken to mitigate and shorten relapse WHEN it occurs, rather than simply saying, \"you better not or we'll publicly shame you by taking your chips away.\"",

It broke my heart, but after that I also noticed the people that didn't like him. His direct coworkers who knew he'd be 'unable to motivate himself' the first 2h a day, that he was prone to unpredictable mood-swings and would lash out, that he was self medicating with alcohol, etc. \n\nIt made me really sad for him, because his 'great personality' was born out of a place of despair and loneliness and basically shaped by \"what gets me the least amount of rejection\".\n\nEDIT: and my heart continues to break when I see how many people identify with him.

            "comment": "I'm a dude. I was brutally raped multiple times between the ages of 7 and 10. My one and only attempt at try to get help from a therapist was one of the most awful experiences of my life. I attempted to get help in my early 20s. Upon first going in I was asked what had happened to me, after explaining a basic outline of the abuse. I could already see that she was very dismissive and seemed not to really believe me. She then asked about my relationship status. At the time I was in a long term relationship with a woman who had 2 kids (boys). Upon finding this out she immediately demanded the names and address of my girlfriend, names of the kids and said she would be immediately getting in touch with social services to ensure that I wasn't abusing them... I can't put into words just how much that destroyed me mentally, that she could obviously see something in me that I couldn't see! That somehow she was certain that I would be an abuser! I started to cry... She told me to pull myself together. I also can't put into words the pathological visceral HATRED I have for paedophiles and rapists!! If I could get away with murdering them i would! I would NEVER NEVER EVER inflict the absolute nightmare I went through on any child. \n\nI got up and left, i came very VERY close to the edge of suicide that day. I also immediately ended the relationship because I couldn't deal with the thought that the kids might be at risk because of me. It's now 21 years later and I'm tearing up typing this. Because of that experience I have never sought therapist help again. I survive mentally, but its not good survival.\n\nEdit :- Wow! Just wow! I am absolutely blown away by the Internet strangers who are sending love and care to me. I am currently alone, in the dark, in tears, reading all these replies. To answer a few questions. I'm in the UK. I heard she was fired a few years later after a patient of hers committed suicide and mentioned her 'therapy' in the note he left. I am in a position where currently I'm in such a fragile (very heavily medicated) mental state that If I saw another therapist and got the same reaction that I know my mind would break and I'd take my own life. Every day is a struggle to find reasons to stay alive. I'm sure I have ptsd as I feel the need to be armed with a knife constantly (despite being a big dude, 6'4\", 110kg) i sleep with a knife under my pillow. I often wake up screaming. I tend to be 'stand offish' with everyone, deliberately keeping people at a distance. I know I'm a broken person... I've even avoided relationships with women with kids because I don't want my broken mental state to somehow effect those kids in any way. I have attempted suicide twice and both times I survived. I just want there to be a pill or operation where I could completely wipe out the past, even wipe me out, wake up and just have a new me, minus the depression, anxiety, fear, ptsd, crushing hatred of myself, it would be nice to wake up one day and actually be able to see some value in myself. I'd love to br married and be a dad but currently I'm in a state where I can't ever see or allow that to  happen. I'm too scared that my mental state would fuck up my wife and kids lives. I can't allow that.",

Its scared the shit out of me. I thought I was a monster!  I almost committed suicide several times over the next few months until I found my wife. She brought me to peace. She's been my life and savior ever since. She's been my rock. Thinking back on it going on 14 years later, I think she should've lost her right to be a therapist.

I love that people are more open to getting help, but there\u2019s also a big problem with labeling \u2018normal\u2019 ups and downs of life as anxiety and depression among some college students I work with. My main concern with that is how quickly people can seek medication to numb the ups and downs instead of working through them (and the bigger concern- how quickly medication is given.) I\u2019ve also had a ton of young people coming to me self-diagnosing as having borderline personality disorder, which is incredibly complex and a lot of therapists wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable diagnosing it in a young person to begin with.\n\nEdited to add after a great comment from someone: a lot of people DO have clinical depression/anxiety/etc, and it\u2019s incredibly validating to hear that it\u2019s not just \u201cwho you are\u201d as a person. It can also give hope that the symptoms can get better.\n\n2nd edit based on comments: if you\u2019re wondering if you should go to a therapist, go! Even if it is just ups and downs, we all need help sometimes. And it might be something more serious, they\u2019re the ones that can help you figure that out.",

Some studies show the average number of times someone goes back before leaving for good is 7 times. I know why people go back and I get that it's often a combination of manipulation, financial control, gaslighting, love, low self-esteem, fear, etc. But, man, it is hard to watch and appear neutral. I can say I am worried about their safety but I can't yell \"for fuck's sake, stop going back!! What is it going to take?!\" Like I want to. \n\nThe other situation isn't really judging the person it's more judging OCD. But OCD is weird. The infinitely weird ways it can show up are so funny and bizarre. Again, I would never judge a person for having the intrusive thoughts they have or doing the compulsions that are somehow linked in their mind to those obsessions, but I absolutely judge OCD and constantly marvel at how creative and weird the human brain can be.",

I lost my wife and am a single father and I wasn't acknowledging that my grieving is just different than our societal expectations and instead of criticizing it I should tend to it.  I also let these judgements affect my personality at times and lead to it being put on others on occasion, which I took time to make amends with those that I felt I wronged.  So, I wrote a letter to myself as if I was writing to my best friend and I was shocked as I wrote it at the amount of kindness and forgiveness I would've given him.  He could've done almost anything in his grief and I would've loved him and waited for him to return to the best version of himself.  Heavy shit coming outta that one",

I know I'm exceptionally good at some stuff, but the downer side of me just saps all ambition or enthusiasm to get stuck into tasks.\n\nI respond well to positive reinforcement, but the first negative stumbling block will derail me entirely. As a result, I have a litany of incomplete personal projects and find beginning new things or starting new jobs incredibly daunting because I'm convinced it'll happen again.\n\nI find it almost physically difficult to apply myself fully to work now. I'm on Serimel, not sure if it's doing anything.\n\nI was doing CBT for a while, until my therapist told me I didn't need her anymore. I had gotten a new job and things were looking up, but the economic impact of covid gutted all that. I'm going to get in touch with her again, though I'm sure she's swamped.\n\nEdit: Wow, this exploded and mushroomed like a huge exploding mushroom!

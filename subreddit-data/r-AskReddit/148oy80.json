Copy pasted from another thread (back when uber pool was a thing)\n\nBack when uber pool was REALLY cheap, you could save like 90% by taking a pool vs your own uber in Chicago. I'll never forget getting in an uber pool, and the girl in the backseat with me is on the phone. I'm not really listening until I hear, \"so I'm leaving his place, he's still dripping out of my coochie, and ANOTHER HOE IS COMING UP TO HIS DOOR AS IM LEAVING. I couldn't fucking believe it, you just fill me up and are already getting another girl, I would've been down to go again, but no he's bored with me....ugh I can't believe I'm going to see him again tomorrow.\"\n\nIt was so mind blowing to hear someone talk like that with other humans around they weren't close to. She got out, and the driver turns to me and just goes \"Chicago full of these skanky white girls, i was born at the wrong time my man.\" Never wanted to get out of an uber faster",

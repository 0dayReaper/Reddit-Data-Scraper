It never goes anywhere and it stays within my trusted people - my mom, my brother, &amp; my 2 closest best friends and it usually all stems from my own personal life. \n\nLike very recently I had a newer friend do something rather egregious (that did subsequently in a minimal way impact me), like Lifetime television/Real Housewives level of dramatic shit and you can bet your ass I ran running with it to my mom and closest friends to share that tea. Some stuff is just entertaining to talk about and it really is perspective sharing for me. \n\nI share this gossip, because I also live 3,000 miles away from all the aforementioned people and \"gossiping\" helps bring them into my life. If I only ever talked to them about my boring day-to-day shit and not the fun dramatic stuff that happened in the workplace or my new friend circle, conversation would trickle down real quick. \n\nA lot of it is \"this happened\" or \"so and so did this\" and then we discuss, spitball, talk about how things like that have happened similarly in our pasts, whatever. \n\nHell, I've had past boyfriends that LOVE gossip more than me. Always asking what some of my friends are up to if they know they're going through something that's fun to chat about. It's just what humans do. \n\nI absolutely gossip but it lives in a bubble. It impacts nobody. \n\nNot all gossip is malicious and to suggest that it is is just ridiculous.",

We slept together after the 3rd date and I wanted to see her again the next day after we both worked because I fall easily and become like monogamous after sex. \n\nSo we go to work and afterward decide to go to the bar with some of my friends. I wanted to introduce her to them and kind of flex, show her off a bit. We get there and I swear to god when she met my friend Jesse she completely ignored me for the rest of the night and left with him.. They ended up getting together, and split after a few months. And she had the gull to text me to hang out again after\u2026 I think I\u2019m still emotionally scarred from that. She was perfect just the two of us, then she had zero loyalty to me in a social setting. To be fair I never communicated that I wanted us to be exclusive but I still felt betrayed by both of them.. That is now my biggest flag I look for",

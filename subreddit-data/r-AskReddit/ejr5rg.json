            "comment": "For some reason or another, my mother hated me. As a little girl I could never understand why she treated me so much worse than my 3 other siblings, and I would often go up to my Grandmother and ask her \"Why doesn't my momma love me?\" She never could give me a straight answer and would tell me \"Your momma loves you in the only way she knows how...\". That answer confused me because she loved my siblings just fine (Disclaimer: Her love was toxic AF, and she did a different type of damage to my other siblings.). \n\nNow when I say that my mother treated me badly, it started out with her picking fights with me. She would constantly nitpick at everything I  did, chastising me, and at the end of the day punishing me harshly for something that could have been a gentle scolding. When I got older, she started cussing at me, and calling me names. She would often ignore me for days on end, and when she would talk to me it would be to make me the butt end of a bad joke, or to tell me she hated me. \n\nYes, my mother looked me dead in my eyes and told me she hated me (Disclaimer #2: She was a drug addict and alcoholic, and she loves to claim all the emotional abuse she put me though as a child was the effects of the drugs, and it \"wasn't even that bad\"). It was things like that that really began to tear at me after awhile. All sorts of terrible things she did to me growing up, the terrible things she said, and how she ignored me constantly... All of it very different than how she treated my other three siblings.\n\nShe was very close with one of my brothers and my sister. She would spend time with them constantly, take them anywhere, buy them anything that they wanted and it made me resent them. My sister would sometimes rub it in my face that \"Mom loved her more\". It was her way of having power over me, and it was one of the things that made my rage bubble over on innocent people.\n\nI just wanted to be loved and accepted, I wanted to be cared for and cherished as a child should be, and when I didn't get that, I plotted on how I was going to get her love and affection. In my screwed up mind, I thought that if I got rid of my older brother and younger sister... I would be one of the only people left for her to love. \n\nI planned on killing my brother. How screwed up is that? It wasn't just some thought that passed through my head; it was a constant idea, a plan that I was putting into place to end his life so that I could make room in my mother's heart for me.\n\nI feel ashamed writing it out. It was a dark time in my life, and I was also incredibly mentally ill. \n\nMy brother was addicted to pain medications, and my parents were trying desperately to get him clean at the time. Ironically, at the same time he was going on a drug induced rampage, my sister had shattered her leg on a trampoline. She was on some pretty heavy pain pills, and while my mother was doing everything in her power to keep my brother away from the drugs, she would leave my sister (and her drugs) in my care. So one day, while my mother was out dealing with my brother and my sister was sleeping, I took the rest of her pills (my sister was super afraid of becoming addicted to drugs after watching what my mother and brother were going through, so there was a ton left) and I waited for my brother to come back. \n\nWhen I heard him come through his window (His room was next to mine) I went into the kitchen and made him a glass of juice. Earlier in the day I had crushed up the pills into a powder, and I mixed them into the juice. I went up to his room, knocked on the door, and offered him the cocktail of various prescription drugs. He took the juice, and right before he was about to drink it I had  thought.\n\n\"How could I do this to my own brother?\" \n\nI snatched the drink back, and it spilled all over the carpet. He was high and super pissed, but at least he was alive. \n\nI never tried anything like that again. It felt so sick, wrong, evil... I mean, what type of person thinks about killing their brother?  Besides, my brother dying wouldn't make my mother love me any more, she would have just resented me for living instead of him.\n\nSo thats' the sad, sick story of how I almost executed my brother. I didn't actually carry through with it, obviously, and I guess everyone lived happily ever after. My brother got clean and now has a happy family, I'm in college, my sisters leg healed up nicely, and my mom left us after awhile... (But thats' a story for another time).",

            "comment": "I have two sisters. One older, and one younger. My mom worked hard to make sure each of us felt special and loved. My dad? Not so much. He called my older sister *Princess* and my little sister was referred to as *Little Buddy*. For whatever reason, I got kind of forgotten about. I didn't mind most of the time. I found my dad annoying, demanding, and at times unreasonable. I hated the way he bullied my mom and would lash out about things that didn't make sense. Basically, I thought of my dad at a total brat. He'd have a bad day at work, and would find someone to take it out on. Usually, my mom and I. But I still tried. I'd try to cuddle up with him, feeling hurt when he'd shrug me off and tell me I need to shower. I made gifts for him. Got good grades, won poetry contests. Won awards through bible quiz. Never argued. But it never seemed to work. Before long, he'd find something to yell at me about. Things that usually didn't make sense. If my little sister and I fought, the whole thing was my fault. My feet turn in. I hated when my dad would come to my sporting events, because seeing me run with inturned feet seemed to be humiliating for him. One time I was running from one base to another, feeling exhilaration because *I'd done it*. *I'd hit a home run*. The smile died on my face when I heard my dad yell, \"Run with your feet straight! You look stupid!\"\n\nAs a teen, my mom really stepped up and started insisting that he was going to leave me alone. He was never physically abusive, but the way he talked to you made you feel like he was trying to say something that would break you. \n\nWhen I was 15, he was almost successful. I went through a couple of really bad months. A friend died, my dog died, we moved, and my mental health was tanking. A week after my friend died (car accident), my dad asked, \"So when are you going to get over it?\" It took me by surprise, because at that time, I wasn't crying or acting out. I was just sitting there, eating dinner with the family. My mom immediately reacted, gasping out a surprised, \"John!\" and the two of them began fighting again, over my dad's need to mess with me. I sat there, head down on the table, thinking, *I'm not allowed to be sad. I'm not allowed to feel happy. I can't get mad. I'm in pain, and he finds it annoying. Just leave me alone, dad. Leave me alone.*\n\nThat's when it clicked: my dad, for whatever reason, seemed to hate me. I could try to make him like me, but it wasn't going to work. As I got older, my goal became to avoid him, his seemed to be to forge a relationship with me with the sole purpose of having a target for his need to bully. We were never going to have a healthy father-daughter relationship\n\nThat's when it clicked: it's not me, it's him. My sisters could like and love him, but I didn't need to respect him. I was done trying to please him, trying to do the right things, trying to be the daughter that my dad seemed to want.\n\nFast forward almost ten years later. After the birth of my son, my dad had tried to begin a new relationship with me, because for whatever reason, he latched on to my kid. For the sake of my kid, I let my dad have a relationship with him, but I was always monitoring, waiting for my son to develop a personality that would change the way my dad saw him. There was no way I was going to let my dad do to my son what he did to me. \n\nFortunately, my dad died before the change could happen. I sat in the back at his funeral, dry eyed and satisfied. Of course my sisters were upset. They had good relationships. But for me and my mom, it kind of felt like the wicked witch was at long last dead. No more stress. No more unreasonable expectations. The egg shells we'd been walking on were swept away, and we could be content. \n\nI have an uncle in West Virginia that I started to see as my father-figure. At first, I jokingly would call him dad, testing the waters, waiting for him to remind me that he actually has kids, and doesn't need an adopted daughter. I go see him once a year. But I always felt like maybe, he sees my need to see him as a dad to be annoying. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, I asked him if he was coming up for Christmas. He said he couldn't. \n\nBut then he said, \"I love you, my daughter.\"\n\nSorry this was so long. I guess I needed to get that out.",

I didn't feel safe in many different ways.\n\nIt all culminated to a point when I was 17, disowned, and about to get kicked out. But, my vindictive, defensive actions in the past made my mother know that kicking me out wasn't a good idea. I know the only reason I could have a roof over my head was becuase my mom isn't a citizen, and she knews I would have reported her for the crime of child abuse (which did happen) which would have put her residency in jeopardy.\n\nSo, I guess I had to threaten to burn the village in order to feel the warmth of safety.\n\nEdit: A lot of people are assuming my mother is illegal, but she's not. I'm not exactly sure the mechanism through which she can stay in the United States, but she married my dad (American) and they got divorced. She can live and work here but she doesn't have the full protection of the government like me.",

She would overhear my pitch for cards (required) and then lie to the customer so they would apply. I would have to try and rectify what she said while she hovered over me. She did many other questionable things, and I reported her multiple times, as did my coworkers (and customers).\n\nNow, one time i got lucky and an 18 yo kid came in yo buy the most expensive desktop we have on display. 2.5k. she saw me do this sale, but i needed a manager to approve a tiny discount, but my radio was dead. Coworker was watching me the entire time, so i asked if she'd call for the mgr. She stone cold ignores me. I go for the mgr, she prints out paperwork on the computer and tries to sell it to him. When i return, she literally yells at me in front of the customer to give her the sale bc she worked too. I ignored her &amp; didn't give her the sale.\n\nWhen i reported this (as did the customer, he was mortified), i was literally told by my boss \"ignore when she does that. She's a middle child, so she does stuff like that\" \n\nI was tired of the stupid lack of action, so i filed an HR complaint regarding her......and five of my managers for not addressing it. They all got reamed for it. Only one is still in a management position, the rest were eventually demoted or laid off.",

Not only was she an unpaid volunteer, she had to take a vacation day off work and pay for her hotel room and parking.  On the morning that the convention started, she was setting up the first of the three rooms she was responsible for -- manual labor, moving tables, setting up shelves and loading them with stuff -- and somebody came in, took her ID badge off her desk, and brought it to the convention's lost-and-found.  Convention L-F lady told wife that lost badges have a $5 fee to get them back.  Wife looked at the badge, looked at her, and said \"Keep it. I'm going home. Have a nice convention.\". Wife was about 25 feet down the hall when L-F lady caught up to her and returned her badge.",

I was physically bullied, verbally mocked, humiliated in front of the other kids, and not an eye was batted. When I finally took my mom's advice to make a scene the next time someone started throwing things at me, I did it. We were outside that day for P.E. and while we were all sitting in lines at the start of class a kid in the line next to me started throwing pebbles at me. I ignored it for a moment, then when he kept going I yelled at him to stop. I didn't care that people were staring, I wanted them to. I wanted them to see that this average-height, able-bodied boy was throwing things at me, a very small and disabled girl. The teacher came over and asked what happened. Kid told him they were only pebbles, he wasn't hurting me. The teacher agreed with him and told me if I ever disrupted his class like that again I was getting detention.\n\nI don't know what it is about some teachers but the second they get put in charge of more than one child they become absolutely blind to any kind of bullying, and if it gets pointed out to them, they think that particular incident exists in a vacuum and couldn't possibly be a sign of anything worse. I was 11 years old and suicidal because I felt so incredibly powerless. That teacher only solidified that feeling.",

I was the girl that had to get eye surgeries and kids had a literal and figurative field day with it. How are you now?\n\nThe way my teachers were \"blind\" to bullying was by gaslighting, \"Oh, they actually like you! That's why you're being treated this way!\" Like, are you fucking kidding me? I mean, this was the 90s, but now a statement like that would get a crusade for that teacher to be fired and that school a civil suit.\n\nMy parents -well, more my mom because my dad was always on business trips- took my treatment seriously. I couldn't imagine what it was like for my mom to see me come home every day crying.  When my dad was home, he told me if anyone ever touched me, I needed to punch, kick, scream at them, but most of all, defend myself.\n\nUnfortunately, I had no idea after this conversation that one of the groups that bullied me were planning on beating me up. The day it happened, I was on the playground with one of my friends bouncing a ball back and forth. All of a sudden, I heard what sounded like yelling behind me, but I thought nothing of it until I saw this shock register on my friend's face. The yelling got closer and by the time I realized, it was too late. \n\nIt was three kids wrestling and they fell on top of me. All of a sudden, their combined weight is crushing me and I'm being punched, kicked, and having my face drilled into the pavement. My screaming drew the attention of the recess aid, yet the three kids somehow just kind of walked off. I was escorted to the nurse's office and she called my mom. I remember that I wasn't sent back to class and I was sent home early. My backpack was brought by my teacher. Nobody saw me. \n\nOnce I saw myself, I had two black eyes, my cheeks were yellow from bruising, scraped, and so were my elbows. I never saw my mom so angry. My parents spoke to the school themselves and told them, \"three kids just don't 'fall on top of' another kid and look like our daughter does.\" Whatever else my parents said to the principal and other administration must have gotten through because not one teacher the whole time I was in that school ever treated me like my complaints didn't matter. As far as those kids go, nobody was ever really punished because it happened so fast that I didn't get a solid look at them.\n\nAs I said before, our situations in the present day wouldn't go without some kind of ramifications on the school's end. I hate even using the term \"sue happy\", although when both teachers and administration don't take a stand to adequately and effectively protect students, the fault rests totally on their incompetency.",

Gonna brag - that shit never happened in my class without it being recognized. I once had a girl make fun of an autistic classmate. He was high-functioning, but obviously had social difficulties. She made fun of him in front of the class. I casually told the boy to go to the main office to get me a red science pencil, or something made up. Once he left, I tore that girl a new one, and when I was done with her, I ripped the other kids for sitting there and allowing it to happen. I explained to them how being indifferent to abuse/bullying is just as bad. That shit was just not tolerated in my class. I told them if they learn nothing about math or science in my class (I had them for both subjects - 6th grade), I'm going to at least teach them to be decent human beings.\n\nWow! Thanks for the gilding! Some people asked for a little more background. I am a white male, worked in a Title 1 (lower income - majority of students qualified for free or reduced lunch), mainly Hispanic (primarily Mexican), in Los Angeles county. There have been numerous times where I didn't teach according to the standards that day, as I took time to teach about the Jewish, Armenian, Hutu/Tutsi, Cambodian, and other genocides from the 20th century, as well as other teachable moments (lighter-skinned Hispanic kids calling darker ones the \"N\" word, why Hitler jokes aren't appropriate, why I've never hit my children or wife, etc.). I WISH there were humanities lessons/classes throughout the grades, but, alas, those subjects aren't on the standardized tests.",

When he wasn't it was just go time.\n\nOne night (I was 14) he got drunk and when I got home from a girlfriend's place he cornered me and put a revolver to my head. He told me how worthless I was and that he would be doing me a favor by killing me. I didn't respond. I didn't move. I just waited for him to pull the trigger.\n\nHe didn't. He left my room and left the revolver on my dresser as he walked out. I took the revolver and went out. I walked around my hometown, sat by the river and thought about all the ways I could get back at him for all the misery he caused my mother, sister, and I.\n\nI also considered doing the ol' Kurt Cobain but that's not relevant.\n\nI took the weapon apart and threw it's pieces in the river. No one's asked me about the gun since. It's probably still there.\n\n\nEdit: holy shit, that blew up. Thanks for all the upvotes and awards, everyone!",

He had punched her in the face, knocking her down and as she fell she knocked the knife block which sent them clattering everywhere. \n\nAs she got up to run away, the husband grabbed her by the hair so roughly he ripped a part of her scalp off. She had another knife in her hand and spun around and stabbed him through the hand. \n\nShe ran out of the house and came to our house across the road. My mum pulled her inside and called the police. By this point her husband had freed himself from the floor, but couldn\u2019t remove the hand knife, and limped to our place. He\u2019s at our house yelling at us that he was going to kill his wife, my mum, my sister and I (my dad was away for work) if we didn\u2019t send his wife home right now. \n\nMy mum isn\u2019t the type of person to take threats lightly, so she walked out of the house with this giant Aboriginal tribal spear (which was completely ornamental and couldn\u2019t hurt you other than being whacked with it) and told this bloke to get the fuck off our property before she sticks him like the pig he is. \n\nThe cops arrived shortly after that. Old mate went to prison for beating his wife and threatening to kill us. They also charged him with possession of a deadly weapon - which I found hilarious because the knife was stuck in his hand so he had no choice but to possess the knife. \n\nEventually, people just get sick of your shit and they\u2019ll fucking stab you if needed. Or stab you twice if it\u2019s doubly needed.",

            "comment": "Dumped at the doorstep of a youth shelter after my mum was hospitalized and dad was in prison. I wasn't a super bright teenager, but had enough sense to spend my last $20 on pepper spray and padlocks for my stuff. Predictably, people's stuff went 'missing' all the time. \n\nI could write an essay on the issues in the public welfare system, ranging from the macro level (lack of funding) to the micro level (incompetent or burnt out staff). There was violence, substance use, and sexual assault in crisis accommodation, but what bothers me ten years later is the sheer *stupidity* of some adults who are meant to guide at-risk teenagers. I would ask my social worker questions like, are there places which can help me with food this week? How do I write a resume? And that social worker would vaguely shrug and offer relaxation techniques and mindfulness strategies. Look, three people got arrested at this shelter last week, no amount of 'relaxation techniques' are going to calm me down. \n\nI'm guilty of doing stupid and irresponsible things as a teenager, but eventually finished high school and then 3 university degrees. I actually work for the same system that I was and am disappointed in, and there are so many practical resources available. They're underutilized because staff don't even know they're out there. If I had just a single adult to help me with the most simple tasks as a kid, it would have been so much easier. When you're a kid you just don't know how university loan applications, taxes, budgeting, etc works. Or at least I didn't. And everybody assumes that you do, because *they* do. Like I had no idea that in my country, the Department of Housing can pay for your rental bond. I stayed in a homeless shelter for an extra 1-2 months to save up $900 to pay for the bond of a shitty apartment. Extra months of broken sleep, men trying to pick the lock to my door, residents hyped up on ice. \n\nLast year there was a 16 year old girl on the train, having a meltdown and making a public scene. She was clearly drunk and people were avoiding her. She started screaming that she missed her period and does anybody want to pay for her termination. She phrased it as a joke or a way to get money (which I did not give). But I guess she repeated it enough that I wondered if it was true. We got to talking and I referred her to a social service, downloaded a list of resources in her catchment area, and saved links and forms on her phone about how to arrange her own healthcare cards since she's over 15, so that she can visit a bulk-billing GP on her own and get tested. In my country, the pee test from a pharmacy is about $15 but a pregnancy blood test ordered by your GP is free. We discussed different options that her GP might outline and other things that might be helpful. \n\nI know as well as anyone else that it's not always that straight-forward - especially with 30 patients in your caseload and juggling them with a million other priorities. But in the biopsychosocial framework of health - where biological, psychological, and social factors are proposed to impact physical and mental health - we severely underestimate the impact of social circumstances. We let these kids down all the time, and it's preventable.",

To be honest now as an adult, I can become very impatient and harsh sometimes. It's because now things are going well and I've hit my stride in my career, so I become unjustifiably frustrated when others make mistakes. \n\nWhen that happens I try to remember the amazing people in the system and how patient they were when I was clueless, tired, or just ungrateful. Mainly my high school teachers. I ended up completing high school part-time while working a couple of jobs, and I just didn't understand many chemistry and math concepts. Some of it was from skipping school, but it's also just never clicked automatically for me. \n\nMy chemistry teacher helped me at every opportunity and let me submit everything late on the *last day* of the school year, and my math teacher spent most of his lunch hours catching me up with algebra and calculus. My art teacher bought all my art supplies and then offered to buy my artwork so I'd have money for university textbooks. For the past ten years I've held myself and others accountable to the standard of humanity they have set.",

I can not recommend it, but it worked for me.\n\nFew tips for moving out without parental help: \n\n- Life is so expensive. Things like kitchenware, toilet paper, shampoo, food etc are all big costs. Shopping in bulk and from cheap supermarkets are a life saver.\n\n- Learning to cook is not only an awesome way to impress friends/dates/whatever it\u2019s also a valuable life skill and who knows, you might really enjoy it. I found that to be the case.\n\n- If you end up working a shitty minimum wage job, that\u2019s okay. It\u2019ll be hard work but keep at it.\n\n- House share if you can. In my city a one bedroom flat costs about \u00a3800pm. My room in a four bedroom is \u00a3375pm. No brainer.\n\n- Self care is important! Don\u2019t drink or do drugs too much or too often, find time to relax and treat yourself once in a while.\n\n- Lastly, while you\u2019re stuck in a shitty situation, until you can get out, try to keep sane. Having a group of friends close by or that you see often can be a great way of reminding yourself of who you really are, and not what any toxic people who might be saying otherwise.\n\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve got I think, feel free to PM me anything though. Sorry if it\u2019s quite rambly or straight up incoherent, it\u2019s 5am. \n\nHappy living!",

My dad eventually got a girlfriend when I was about 11 or 12, and she had three kids. They were okay people, as far as I knew. My dad had started a business as a traveling phone card salesman. He'd go from bodega to bodega restocking the phone cards they ordered and presenting them with new options. He would pick me up for the weekend and take me to work. This was our bonding time. I remember once while he was showing me how to fill out an invoice that he mentioned I should learn it because I was going to take over, but he never mentioned that again.\n\nHe did pretty well for himself, eventually opening up a store of his own, which had phone booths that you'd control from a computer behind the main desk. It would route calls through specific networks to get the lowest price to the caller's destination. Anyway, I told you all of that to tell you that I eventually became his tech support when I was about 14. I helped set up some.of his tech at the store, and kept it running. He didn't pay me or anything, and I even helped run the store after he had a stroke. At some point I guess his girlfriend wanted more money so she just took it out of the register. I came to find out she blamed me for it, and my dad believed her.\n\nWe stopped talking for about 10-15 years. I have no use for that, and he wasn't a great dad to begin with. He had been abusive to my mom when I was 4-5, and I don't care to give him much rope to bother hanging himself. He now tries to talk to me. I humor him and answer the phone once or twice a year. I'm good. I don't do anything to hurt him, but I have no reason to change my life to make his any better or worse. They're your children, and if you don't want them in a particular environment then it's your decision, nobody else's.",

I tried to run away over and over in my late teenage years, hiking across the desert in the dark to get to the highway, where I would try to hitch a ride. Every single time, well-intentioned truckers called the police to report a little girl walking along the highway with her thumb out. I am short, and I had been malnourished my entire childhood, so even after I turned 18, I was underdeveloped and couldn't convince anyone I was an adult. Michael always called me in as a runaway and the cops would take me back. The last time, I was 20, and I felt so hopeless when I saw the police lights, I thought very seriously about trying to attack the officer with my knife (that I always brought in case I was picked up by a crazy person.) I knew I was too small and weak to actually hurt the officer, but he would be obliged to arrest me and send me to jail. It was the only way out I could think of.",

                            "comment": "Sorry - I was in a hurry because my husband was waiting for me to watch a show with him. I answered the question, more or less, and didn't think people would be very interested to hear the rest.\n\nI never tried to use the knife on the officer. It was the only way out that I could think of, but I was afraid I might accidentally actually hurt him, or he'd hurt me, and I couldn't find the courage. I just gave up. I sat in his back seat and cried until I got home, and just quit trying to escape for at least 8 or 9 months.\n\nThe biggest problem with trying to escape was no ID to prove my age. The next biggest problem was money. I was going to college on a Pell grant, and was working at the college as a work study. Michael would have us sign over our checks, because \"we didn't need the money when he was supporting us,\" and we couldn't cash the checks without photo ID anyway. And he wouldn't let us learn to drive, because that would have given us a literal key to independence. \n\nOver the course of almost two years, my boss at my work study job got the truth of my home situation out of me, and she helped me figure out what to do. She told me which documents I would need to find and get hold of to get photo ID, then when I had my birth certificate and SS card, she drove me to the DMV to get an ID. She also hired me for a second job there at the college, tutoring, so I was teaching adults to read and teaching Braille to the newly blind, during every free hour of my day. Michael never knew about that job. Every two weeks, I'd give Michael my check from the one job, and my boss would take me to cash the other. She also helped me set up a bank account, and taught me to drive. I found two sisters who were willing to take me in as a roommate, and I had enough income to pay my portion of the rent. One of the sisters drove out to Michael's property to pick me up, and Michael called me in as a runaway, expecting it to go as it always had. But that time, I had proof of my age, and I was nearly 21 by that time.\n\n\nEdit (to clarify a few things I keep being asked about):\n\nIt was a poor community college in Arizona in the late 90's. So small that they had to have many campuses in small towns over about a quarter of the state. We didn't have student ID's. The high school in the town where I graduated got photo student ID's sooner than the college did, though both were after I was done there.\n\nMy mom filled out my FAFSA paperwork, W4's, etc. She had my birth certificate and SS card. She didn't need photo ID for that stuff. Once we turned 18, they couldn't collect welfare for us anymore, and sending us to college on the government's dime while we did work study jobs was lucrative for them. It still didn't leave *me* any way to prove my age in the middle of the night, at the side of a highway, when cops would ask for ID I didn't have, when they had a report of a runaway teen matching my description.\n\nAs to how we got to and from the college, one of the mothers drove us everywhere. She was the only one allowed to drive. That's why I was at the college long enough hours to have a second job Michael didn't know about. We would pile into the vehicle and arrive there at 7:00 am, when the earliest classes started, and all leave together at 9:00 or 10:00 pm, depending on our class schedules for that semester.\n\nI can't really answer the question about why I never ran away from the college itself, and always ran at night. Part of it was that one of the few things the kids could do to get approval from Michael, was to tell him something another of us was doing \"wrong,\" so the people who should have been my allies were constantly policing me instead. Also, if I left during the day, *someone* at the small college or in the small town, would be able to tell Michael who they had seen me with. But I honestly don't remember thinking about it very much, like, in retrospect I can see reasons I wouldn't have done it that way, but I can't remember actually even thinking about it at the time. Like it somehow just never occurred to me. I guess mostly it was just that night time felt safe and secret, and daytime felt exposed.",

If you weren't part of the in-crowd you weren't given the same support. There were many of us that existed on the outskirts, working so hard just to see the same few people get all the opportunities, even as far as being cast in lead roles after they graduated.\n\nAs I struggled with depression, anxiety, and undiagnosed ADHD, I worked tirelessly to keep up with my peers only to be told I needed to apply myself more. I saw people put in half the work some of us did and end up with higher grades. One professor actually gave arbitrary grades to the 4+hours of homework he assigned based on page counts and who he thought \"deserved a higher grade\".\n\nI tried so hard to get no support in return that I became incredibly suicidal and had to take a semester off to deal with my mental health. It only took two more years and another medical break before I finally was able to graduate.",

I was part of the tech crew so sound lights etc. There was this one girl (part of the in clique) who was the only nice one, especially to me. We mat in private 2 times and she would text me a lot. Then in the week before the first show of the musical, she humiliated me by claiming she was just pranming me, showing others in front of me our private texts, and then admitting that she started to date one of my best friends already.\n\nI felt so destroyed, on the day she performed, I was doing the lights and another kid the sound, he had everything set up for the song and left for the bathroom while she was about to start singing. I saw all the controls for her mic on the sound board, and as she opened her mouth I slowly turned down her monitor speaker. (for everyone who doesn't know, the monitor is just heard on stage by the singer, it's so that you can actually hear yourself sing, with all the music etc next to you. Without its like singing while holding your ears closed, it will basically sound like you have no feel for tone, because without the monitor you don't)\n\nThis was over 8 years ago. I'm still very good friends with the guy she actually dated. He told me she was really insane. The type to send death threats after him not texting back for 5 minutes, after they broke up.\n\nEdit: Holy shit, my first awards earned for doing something mean back in school. And people said it won't matter later on :D",

It's not about me, it's about someone I used to know.\n\n_______________\n\nGrowing up, I was part of a huge diverse friend group. People from different schools, different small towns. All walks of life. Something I feel really fortunate for. One of these guys, let's call him Big Bob, was part of our group for years and years. He came from a tough family, never had any money, but honestly, he brought the \"energy\" to the party. One of those guys. Always talking, bombastic, good with jokes and memes and references. So collectively, those of us who had the means found a way to help him along since we did enjoy his company. And this worked for YEARS. We'd drive him home, help sneak him into the movie theater, share food and alcohol  with him. \n\nHowever... As he got older, he started to develop sticky fingers. At first it was candy bars at the cash register. Then it was a odd piece of clothing from a store he'd stuff down his shorts. Then it was portable harddrives in the Best Buy bathroom. Eventually he got caught by the law, which seemed to stifle things... for a minute. \n\nBut then he moved to doing things where the law wouldn't catch up to him. You'd find games wouldn't be returned in a timely manner... Then eventually we found out he had sold an old xbox &amp; games that someone had \"loaned\" him after they bought the new xbox 360. We wanted to have a big LAN party and wanted another system... and that's how we found out that he had sold it for petty cash. He never told anybody. \n\nThis continued. Little things would just go missing. Again, and again, and again. Eventually, I went off to college and he didn't... but those who also didn't go to college you would still hear stories from. Eventually it reached a boiling point and one of the friends in the group confronted Big Bob, one who had been stolen from. Bob denied it all to his face. And we ostracized him. \n\nI know he was in that place. He had a bit of a temper, and I've seen him lose it before and smash his phone on the concrete. I know for a fact he felt like burning the house down after that confrontation night. Nothing actually ever happened, but growing up with him for 10 years I'm sure it was a whirlwind that night.\n\nBut at the end of the day... it was deserved. We tried to make him part of the village. Or at least I hope I did.",

So I always knew that I was loved for the wrong reason and that the moment I\u2019d come out, everybody would hate me to the core. The facade I kept up with lasted into my mid 20s and then one day, I just exploded and updated my social media, coming out. My family hasn\u2019t spoken to me since then. It\u2019s been 6 years. I guess the fire is still burning!\n\nEdit: Wow. Thank you all for your kind words. It means a lot. I know a lot of you are concerned, but I have found my own family. I have a best friend who\u2019s there for me from when I wake up til when I go to bed and vice versa.. Had she been a guy, we\u2019d probably be married by now \ud83d\ude02.\n\nI also feel that I need to clear something up. One of my brothers still speaks to me.  I get to speak to his children and he has changed my view from how I used to look at him. Growing up, he had a mental illness and in my family, we never believed in that either. And I feel terrible because remembering when I was a young teenager all the way until I turned 20, I used to be angry at him saying that I didn\u2019t believe in his \u201cattention seeking\u201d. It was taking a toll on the family and I was mad at him for a long time. I\u2019ve said stuff that I\u2019ll probably have to live with for the rest of my life. Whereas when I came out, he\u2019s the only who didn\u2019t stop talking to me. The \u201ccrazy\u201d (the way mentally ill people are viewed in the culture) family member is the only one who was there for me. I never mentioned that in my original post and I feel like it\u2019s something that should be mentioned. \nAnd today, I\u2019d put him above everyone else in my family, no matter if they\u2019d come around or not. \nAround after I came out, he got into one of his episodes and nobody cared to talk him into getting to the hospital to start his meds again. I was on phone with him from the other side of the world for three days until I convinced him to get into the hospital where they helped him. I like to think that he forgives me for the things I used to say nowadays because I\u2019m doing everything to make him know that I feel like there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with his mental illness.\n\nEdit 2: Okay, I just got my first ever silver. Thank you whoever it was! \u2764\ufe0f",

They day my my parents died (they died a day apart) but it blurred into one, a cop pulls me over. I\u2019m 18. Homeless and have no support. He tells me I did nothing wrong and hands me a seatbelt ticket for $90 and says \u201cdon\u2019t turn out like your parents\u201d in a really shitty tone.

I didn\u2019t think much of my past but one day I had a car accident I went to and it wasn\u2019t bad but the car was overturned and the guy in it was freaked out (rightfully so) and when I get down to let him know helps there, you know who it is? That cop. And I would NEVER refuse care, I wouldn\u2019t imagine doing so to anyone, and it never crossed my mind, but I swear that dude thought I was gonna leave him to die. He started looking like I was death. But instead of the burning down of the village, I helped him and he was really proud of what I became. I explained to him what he had done to me, and he knew. But I think talking to me and getting my point of view was eye opening. Anyways, I still think it\u2019s funny the dude thought I was gonna kill him over a ticket.",

I struggle with feeling worthwhile, and I criticize myself for the smallest things because the hospital conditioned me into nitpicking and punishing myself for not being perfect.

            "comment": "When I was in 7th grade my parents got divorced. My anger and sadness continued to grow. One Thursday night my father picked up my siblings for the obligatory meal out. I declined to go. I went into my room and started fucking around with my chemistry set. Picture this setting; a farmhouse built in 1830, burlap walls in my bedroom, hundreds and hundreds of comic books, and wall to wall carpeting. Your standard tinderbox. Instead of using a bunson burner for my heat source get this...I used an empty plastic Margarine container. And instead of practicing any other safety protocol, I set the fuel on the carpet and lit it. Surprise, the plastic melted almost immediately and the fuel soaked the carpet. Before I \"knew\" what happened flames were licking the walls and furniture.\n\n  At this point I had the good sense to yell \"fire\" to my mother who was blissfully unawares in the kitchen. She dialed 911, while the child genius ran in and out of the inferno trying to save his Marvel's and D.C.'s. Thankfully the emergency services got there quickly and were able to contain the damage to my bedroom. It was completely blackened.  \n\n  For years I believed the whole thing was a terrible accident. Only as an older adult can I admit to one simple fact: My pain and need to be *seen*, manifested in the torching of my own room.",

I wasn't exactly part of their group, but they seemed to enjoy my company. I was both the funny friend and the therapist friend. I helped them through their Prom fiasco when they were at odds with each other. I made them food on occasion. At my graduation, they all said that we should get together as a group and do something fun and bonding before I left for college. One of them even says that she would plan a party for us all. A month passes by, I invite them all to see a movie. One by one, they flake during the week before the movie. I end up going to see it alone. Another month passes, and they've maintained radio silence. Over the next few months, I try to invite them to various events, and without fail, none of them end up being available. I ask them about doing something together, and no dice. All the while, I watch their Instagram posts of going to a lake and having a lake party, or having a new years eve party together. Now, here I am, typing this out on Reddit before going to bed and waking up tomorrow to go out of state for college.",

Nothing you could've done would've changed that. That happens sometimes in friendships, it happens at work, and it sometimes happens in intimate relationships. \n\nThe best way to protect yourself is by remembering that YOUR FRIENDSHIP IS VALUABLE. If you see red flags early, give them some space. If they keep reaching out to you, they may be worth giving some extra time to. Congrats on school, don't drink too much :)",

I\u2019ve kept in touch with most of them through dms and the like.\n\nI told them I was coming to visit for a week months in advance, and we all even discussed dates and plans as the date got closer. We even had the time set! \n\nIn the last few days before the agreed-upon date, everyone cancelled. I only had 2 people left the day before we planned to meet, and they cancelled last minute for bullshit reasons.\n\nIf they didn\u2019t want to hang out, why did we bother setting specific plans on a specific time and date? \n\nI had a lot of fun hanging out with the other friend I was staying with though. At least I know who to not make plans with next year.",

I'll be honest, champ, I always knew you had a drive to you deep down, but I gotta be honest, I don't know if wholesale fire is the deliverable we want to be focusing in on currently. You know we're currently spitballing here to really incentivize growth hacking but the bottom line is that synergy and out-of-the-box thinking has always been our wheelhouse. We can onboard similar strategy initiatives, sure, but I was really hoping you were paying more attention in seminar last week because we really covered this stuff already. Burning to death in a screaming corporate inferno really doesn't demonstrate thought leadership or that 'make-it-happen' mindset we're holding as our central paradigm. The stakeholders just won't swing for perishing in cleansing waves of pure heat and light until skin literally boils and sloughs off. It's kinda low hanging fruit when we're always striving for industry-best practices by and large. Just keep these points on your radar going forwards and remember, we're mostly interested in right-sizing more than asphyxiating on chokingly-thick smoke and passing out before the flames wrap around you like a smothering cloak of searing pain and numb whiteness. Speaking broadly about the market, we wanna disrupt the space but we can't go boiling the ocean every b2b brainstorm. Just keep working on that 30,000 foot view and we'll circle back tonight. Speaking of, we need you to stay in late if that's ok. Perfect, see you then.",

            "comment": "I suppose I started the fire, actually. \n\nI was the only kid in my family to go to college. I'm from Ireland, so it wasn't a financial decision, I was just the only one who worked hard enough in school to have any chance. In my final two years of school I was studying every day, even during summer and winter holidays, from day 1. My other two siblings were at best, showing up for school, except one of them rarely did, and the other showed up high most of the time. \n\nThis was basically the way it went for my entire life, and during that time my parents had focused their attention on the \"problem children\", completely ignoring my needs wants or achievements. I was left alone to do my homework, or expected to help siblings with homework, even though one of them was older than me and was tackling coursework I hadn't even encountered yet. They weren't abusive parents, just bad ones - if my brother or sister got straight C's, we'd go out to dinner to celebrate. I scored in the top 5% for math scores in the country twice in a row, the second time I didn't even get a congratulations.\n\nSo along comes college, and with it exposure to new ideas. I come out as trans to my parents, which they ignore like most things I say. One sibling goes to work in hotels, and eventually around the world on charitourism, working to save turtles and teach kids English. The other eventually moves out of home, gets a job in a hotel he hates, and barely ever calls. I'm stuck at home (it's not common to move out in Ireland if you don't have to during college), and not able to work due to the high workload in college and the long commute (4 hours a day).\n\nSiblings end up back and forth of our family home, and we start to fight a lot. I'm not working, so I don't understand the real world (bare in mind I'd work 40 hours a week during the summer vacation). I'm not doing well in college anymore, so it's assumed I'm slacking off (I'm still in therapy and on medication for depression brought on by stress and neglect). \n\nI eventually go to the United States, where I meet my now wife for the first time. We spend a glorious couple of months together before I have to travel home because yet again, I've failed college. I had one class to make up, so I put my future on hold and return to Ireland, safe in the knowledge that at least my sister is still in China.\n\nExcept she surprises the whole family by coming home for good three days after I get back. \n\nTo cut an already long story short, I finish college, and am a week away from flying back to my now fiance. We're watching a science documentary together on the television. My sister is starts explaining something about it wrong to the youngest sibling (I now have 3, but they're much younger). I correct her, and she tells me I'm wrong. When I tell her I literally have a science degree, the entire reason I'm home at all, she tells me I didn't \"really\" graduate college because I didn't have to take another exam (I was allowed to make up my grade). \n\nI lose it. I curse her out for being an awful bitch who talks down to everyone at every available opportunity, who hasn't held a real job for 3 years and barely limped her out of high school. I yell at my Dad for enabling her shit for so many years, allowing her to walk over family members because she's loud. My mother asks me what's wrong, and I tell her she's raised a hateful, spiteful daughter. \n\nI spend the next week at a friends house before travelling home and packing up my things to load onto the airplane. The night before, my mother tells me she'll get up in the morning to wish my goodbye and goodluck as I start my new life in America.\n\nShe didn't. \n\nThe fire isn't really that warm.",

If I respected life less and had martial skills... but fortunately I am not them. And I refuse to become them. Instead I will do what I can to heal the mess they leave behind.",

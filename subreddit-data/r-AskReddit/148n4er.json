            "comment": "One time shortly after my grandpa died in 2006 when I was 12, I got up in the middle of the night to get a drink of water from the kitchen. And I had to walk past the spare room we used for a computer room to get to the kitchen. Well the door was open, and on the way back to my room, I saw the door slowly closing.\n\nI stopped dead in my tracks, and asked if anybody was there as I thought my step sister was fuckin with me or somebody else was. No response. I go and look in the room and nobody is there. I go and make sure everybody is still sleeping, and they were. The A/C wasn't running at the time so that couldn't have been it blowing it shut. It was odd.\n\nAlso in the same house I had my only experience with sleep paralysis, and it sucked.",

            "comment": "My wife and I were visiting with her dad and we stayed the night at his house. I was the first to get up and I went into the kitchen to make some cereal. When I sat down at the kitchen table, I saw an apparition of an elderly woman wearing a night gown with a small blue flower pattern on it. The apparition just walked past me and into the living room, then it just kinda faded away. I didn't know what to think of it. I have actually had several paranormal encounters, but that experience sticks out to me.",

            "comment": "When I was still in school I would wake up at 6:00 am on the dot every day, and had a pretty good morning routine. Well this particular day, I opened my eyes at 5:58 I remember because my alarm hadn\u2019t gone off yet. A black shadow figure was standing over me, looked like slenderman but all black. I wasn\u2019t experiencing sleep paralysis, fully saw it, sat up and watched it go into the ground. Took me a minute to take in what I just saw, then I got up for the day and got ready like normal. Any time I\u2019ve seen an actual ghost it never really scared me. I just saw it then moved on with my life.",

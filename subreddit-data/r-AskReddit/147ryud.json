He would have puked and passed out long before he got that far. Also she would have told me because we were open about that stuff.

The final straw was that he spilled something on the carpet and didn't clean it up. My wife texted him and asked him to clean it up, several times over a week. Finally she gave him a deadline to get it done. He got irate, started calling her names and insulting her. \n\nThat was the last straw. I texted him once - to let him know everything he owned was now sitting at the curb beside the garbage bin. He could pick it up, or the garbage men whoever got there first. I didn't really care, but neither him or anything he owned was welcome in my house anymore.",

He was so drunk he went into an alcohol induced psychosis and believed that I attacked him earlier in the night and that he was covered in blood. He went into such a rage over his delusion that he nearly drove his car into a building with me in it. I started screaming at him to stop the car and finally some 20 feet before the building's wall he slammed on the breaks. I went to get out of the car and as I was half in the car and half out of the car he stepped on the gas and I almost got dragged. The door slammed into my side and I had major bruising but luckily that was all. He had no memory of it the next day, didn't see too concerned after I told him what happened, and continued to binge drink after that. Oh, and he was driving on a suspended license from a prior drunk driving arrest. Needless to say I left him amongst a lot of other reasons (his drugs, debt, mental health, possible cheating,  etc).",

It allows me to eat, reduces pain and lowers blood pressure, amongst so many other features. Oil is $20/gr $400/jar cream.\n\n She also has comorbidities. I gave her lots of oil and some cream to try. Weed to smoke for few months, brought her groceries and gave her gas money. I am on disability also.\n I have tried to guide her in accessing money she is eligible for through disability for moving/furniture/deposits/crisis grants. Approx $2,500+ she was eligible for a couple months ago, and still had ability to access some of it. She refused. But wanted me to buy her groceries, gas, weed(I don't smoke it) and supply her with the oil products supplied to me, in a trial test to see if it can literally save my life. I also attempted to help her get in to 6 month online school course that paid a top of extra $2700/ month ON TOP of disability payment. She whined. It was too hard.... everything is a whining sound, unless she thinks she losing your attention,  then the lovebombing compliments flow. \n\nThis is a person who has a dozen problems for every solution. She could not see anything positive in anything and was vehemently anti-gratitude. \nShe felt lovebombing me with fake compliments and saying I'm her only friend, like it was going to endear me to her. In reality, it really put on me on high alert. I just stopped responding to her after one day .I was waiting for ambulance, as she sent me a list of demands she needed, cause she wasn't feeling well. I was septic with fungal infection and pretty in and out of lucidness. I told her i called 911.  She was upset I wasn't able to bring her $300 worth products for free. I left her on read \n\nI see her stalking all spots I normally hang out. I have a different car and she doesn't know. Not sure why she still looks for me.  I am kind and generous..but don't take my kindness for weakness..",

She got offended when I said I wasn't attracted to her and upset when I asked why she was mad since she was supposedly straight. I stopped considering her a friend years later when she talked very callously about having an abortion when she knew I was trying to conceive a baby. To be clear, I'm very pro-choice but it's still pretty insensitive to talk about \"sucking this thing out of me\" to someone that is struggling with infertility. I finally blocked her after she reached out years after that and the conversation devolved into her shit-talking her 4 year old stepson because she couldn't get as drunk as she wanted to around him or he'd tell his dad on her \ud83d\ude44",

Over time, our lives just became more and more different.\n\nI graduated college, got a real job, relationship, place to myself, etc.\n\nHe prioritized weed, hanging with friends, video games, etc.\n\nI ran out of things to relate to him with.\n\nThe breaking point was when we were roommates. He was an absolute slob. Never cleaned. The apartment always smelled like weed. Never invited me to do anything but expected me to let him know of my plans.\n\nOne night, I came home with my girlfriend and my roommate was throwing a whole ass party at our apartment. \n\nThe biggest issue was that he literally didn't even invite me to a party at my own apartment.\n\nThe next day, I was hunting for apartments and moved out shortly after. Life has been infinitely better for me since. I surround myself with better people that lift me up rather than pull me down. The former friend is still in my circle of friends so I do see him fairly often but we will never be as close as we once were which is for the best.",

Friends literally paid for a whole vacation for me and supplied me with cigarettes throughout the trip.\n\nI get so angry writing this because I disappointed, neglected and (emotionally) hurt my mother and cat and friends for 5 years straight while being trapped in my silly little world of \" ewww society, relations and the world stink I don't want to participate in any meaningful way\" (well some of these points are still valid but I cant change them anyway so why beat myself up over it) before realizing I should at least TRY and take care of them in some way too.\n\nAnyway I had a great support net (mom and friends) who helped me massively and somehow i convinced myself to atleast go see a doctor about the worries and lethargy i had constantly. \n\nCool doc (known him since i was a kid) prescribed me a box of antidepressants and referred me to a therapist. Therapist didn't help just solidified my views by agreeing (wtf was his strategy, maybe making me realize how ridiculous I've been thinking and living for years straight). But the little pink pills stabilized me enough to realize that I just shouldn't give a fuck about what could/might/may happen and just start living my goddamn life a way I can be proud of.\n\nSorry for rambling, but what you described was one of the ways it may have gone for me and I am beyong glad it didn't.",

(All other vile stuff I have forgotten because I wanted to forget.) I got tired of explaining (which I've done my whole life) and finally had enough, so I answered her one last time and unfriended her on social media. All I ever wanted was to be accepted by her, which never happened. This was 6 years ago, never ever seen her or talked to her since then. The feeling of relief is amazing until now.",

I even rented from her for awhile after she bought a house and needed some financial help but we weren't good housemates, so I found a new place closer to work. I'm bisexual and it became kinda obvious very quickly that she was interested in me, but I wasn't attracted to her. I politely turned her down, explaining I have a very narrow window of what types of women attract me sexually. \n\nI thought the friendship could survive, but honestly, things became more and more obnoxious from there - we were both casually dating other people, but she kept making very passive aggressive comments about who I was seeing, etc. \n\nWhen those comments became racial ones (I had started dating an Asian guy), I started backing out of our friendship very quickly. \n\nFrom time to time we'd see each other at events, but I'm very wary of her now and have blocked her online.",

He would ghost me and my best mate on planned out of school activities. He would constantly compare to before COVID when i was top 10 in the school for athleticism (i was having fun but didn't care about the future). He would even invite his other Japanese mates to walk home with us but would only speak Japanese and would just shit-talk me knowing i understood him. \n\nWell one day my sister decided to dye my hair purple and i was so excited to show my mates but when i met up with henry, and one of his other mates, he just stared, laughed and started conversing in Japanese with his mate whilst laughing. It was that moment when i knew, we weren't mates anymore. I just walked away \n\nI ended quitting school due to bullying and sexual harassment, but im still best mates with my best mates with josh and we hang out constantly. He's helped me so much with my weight loss journey as over these past 3 months I've lost 12 kg.

            "comment": "This was a friend I loved and loved me back. We were extremely close and bonded quickly right after meeting. The first week we met, I hung out with her for over 6 hours daily. She was a kindred soul, and along with her and one other friend, we were like the three musketeers. Unfortunately she had anger and trust issues. They rarely sprouted up, but when they did it was hell's fury. \n\nI watched her blow up on other people several times, all for reasonable reasons to get angry, though with an excessive response. She was working through it and I was helping. Some of these people she got angry at were friends though, and her social circle was leaving her. We talked and talked and she told me \"eventually I'll push everyone away.\" I reassured her that I'd stay by her side and help her through it... but she was right.\n\nAt first I was only a little scared when she got angry at me over something small. It wasn't the usual fury so she showed restraint with me, but I knew I wasn't immune to her anger. Then she targetted a mutual friend of ours. And she raged like an angry god. This was her longest friend, close to 10 years and a really sweet person... But suddenly they were enemy #1 for supposedly hurting a mutual friend. She jumped to conclusions, was completely wrong, was extremely angry, and then tried to make them look bad by telling me a *very* cut version of what happened. I could tell that wasn't the full story. When I found out what really happened, I knew I wouldn't be safe around her. \n\nI'm a gentle person. If she turned on me like that, it'd break me. So despite us having a third (equally close) person in our dynamic, I had to cut her out. Unfortunately that 3rd friend didn't understand it all so they're still friends and I worry he will get hurt now. But I can't be the one to push him away from her. The only comfort is that they seem to not be talking much anymore since both lost interest in something we all originally bonded over. I really hope they just drift apart before an incident happens.",

            "comment": "Not me, but my wife:\n\nIn 2013, my wife became friends with a work colleague; we'll call her 'M.'  M would eventually grow to become good friends with my wife - she was even a bridesmaid in our wedding. \n\nHowever, over the years, I began to notice a pattern my wife refused to acknowledge. My wife was a level or two over M at work; M only seemed to truly be present whenever a work opportunity or challenge presented itself - promotion, lateral move, etc. In these occasions, M would constantly be around. Once M received the promotion or professional advice from my wife or whatever, she'd suddenly vanish until the next work-related thing came around. I warned my wife to keep an eye on M but my concerns were brushed off as me being overly paranoid. There were VERY few times M was around without there being some ulterior motive.\n\nYou can see where this is going.\n\nAs this was happening, M developed a workplace reputation as being extremely difficult - she'd struck out with manager after manager. Despite being the common denominator in these scenarios, she never considered herself at fault for anything.\n\nFast forward to 2017. M also developed a friendship with 'G,' my wife's other close friend. G owned a duplex - her mom lived on one side and she rented the other side out to M. Unfortunately, M and G's mother got along like oil and water and their neighborly relationship deteriorated rapidly. So bad in fact that M and G/G's mother would get into shouting matches so bad, the police had to be called. As a result, M and G permanently hate each other. My wife was in the unfortunate scenario wherein she had to take a side. Neither side was fully innocent, but my wife sided with G, as she'd known G for well over a decade. M did not like this one bit.\n\nFast forward to 2021. There's some major workplace drama on M's team - she reached out to my wife to see if she could step in and help her out. Despite being in management, my wife couldn't because not only would it have been a conflict of interest, the situation was far outside my wife's scope of control - she would've been ineffectual at best in the situation.\n\nMy wife relayed this to M and a few days later, M invited my wife out to dinner. That night, my wife came home streaming tears, her makeup running, etc. Evidently, the \"dinner\" was so M could have a public place to trash my wife. M said my wife was never there for her professionally (Despite helping her numerous times at work, except for the very last situation), turned her back on her during the rental dispute with G. I knew this was going to happen, but I didn't dare go the \"I told you so\" route. \n\nAfter that blow-up, they stopped talking with one another. M still works at my wife's company, though.\n\n**TL;DR:** Wife's friend was manipulative and opportunistic, blew up on my wife when my wife could no longer help her at work.",

I kept making up excuses for him and ways to hang out with him without having to deal with it.

Sometimes I think it would be cool to reach out and hang out but then I tell myself I'm remembering the good times not the shitty times that would happen at some point that same night. They've reached out once a few months later but I just opted not to respond. I'm better off.",

When I got out, I was able to see with eyes unclouded for the first time in ages and cut contact with that person. She had been living in my house and mooching off of me for ages, but she was fun, I enjoyed doing drugs daily with her, hooking up sometimes, and I didn\u2019t see how toxic my life had become until way too late. \n\nAfter that, I was able to successfully finish law school, pass the bar, and start practicing - I have a lot fewer friends now, but that\u2019s OK. I cut off a lot more people than just her - I\u2019d say 95% of my peer group used drugs and drink, so things have been a little lonely but definitely *better*. \n\nTo help with my mental health, I work for nine months each year and then go to Southeast Asia to scuba dive for three months. I\u2019ve been doing that pretty much since I got sober a little under seven years ago. It\u2019s weird, but it works. Although it does make having a traditional relationship in the USA more difficult.\n\nHoly crap, I didn\u2019t realize I was riding a freaking novel about my life. My bad.",

            "comment": "I used to be friends with a guy during college. Eventually we went our separate ways but I tried to keep in touch with him. I knew he got in a serious relationship and eventually had a baby and I would often call him to see how he and his new family were doing.\nI really didn't realize that every conversation we had would very quickly revolve around him. He was never one to ask me questions about my life, or rather he did but only superficially and to keep the conversation on him. It took me a while to notice that he didn't actually remember details about my life, family, aspirations. After college he even belittled my life choices: job, family, studies, and when meeting after quite a while he would keep on mentioning how I had gained weight and that I still had acne.\nThat made me quite uncomfortable, but for some reason I still hung out with him.\nEventually, it got a little more difficult for us to get together or chat over the phone. One day he calls and I'm rather pleased to hear from him. We had some small talk at the beginning and I was excited to tell him about my projects but he simply changed the subject.\nHe was just calling to see if I could drive to my hometown and talk to some man who was selling him a vehicle (ATM, bike, or some crap). I said I couldn't simply drive there because I had a lot of work to do but he didn't seem to listen. He gave me an address, phone number and he was sure I knew the guy (it's a small town but not that small).\nIt took some time for him to realize that I couldn't, and wouldn't, go to my hometown to do an errand for him. Once we hung up it just dawned on me that this person was not really a friend. He never cared about my life and in college he would hang out with me to include him in school projects so he could get good grades. In retrospect, I never got anything from him.\nI never called him again and he hasn't ever tried to do it. I guess I was the one always making the calls.\nI feel ashamed for being this blind, but at least I feel I have a better judgement towards people now.",

This was the start, it was 20 bucks here, beer there, lunch etc. Over the years I didn't really care  but as time went on I found he wasn't maturing and was always looking for a handout despite doing the same type of work I do (carpentry) and working full time. The final straw was when he kept back 50 bucks from an invoice to help pay his boys (17 &amp; 19) who helped out on the small project. He tried to keep 200 and settled on 50 when dropping the cash off with my wife. He knew I was going to be pissed and I was. My principles took over and I promptly returned the stuff he had stored in my garage minus a few items to cover off the shit he never paid me back for. He got home and found his motorbike and boxes in the driveway. He never called or messaged me as I suspected would happen. It was a good friendship while it lasted and I learned how much I was willing to accept and where I draw the line. That was 2 years ago and I'm glad I made the decision I did.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ll post my own as well. \n\nI was friends with Julian since late 2018. We met when he was a Senior and I a Sophomore in college. We both made a friend that semester, we\u2019ll call him Hayden. Hayden was from a rich family (possibly through less than legal means) and fun to be around. But he was also a manipulator. Julian has some serious mental health issues and would consistently think that he has to handle things himself, this despite such attempts always blowing up in his face. Hayden basically saw a massive target. The stress of the situation was so bad, that my psoriasis, having been in remission for several years, came back.\n\nEven after Hayden left our lives, however, Julian still struggled. I tried to be there for him. He grew so paranoid that I made a semi anonymous report through our RA to get him help out of genuine fear of what would happen. It even reached a point that, one night, I was half asleep in our room realizing that he was wasted in the bathroom and had not made a sound in half an hour. I genuinely considered that he had aspirated, but couldn\u2019t bring myself to check because a part of me actually considered how that would bring me peace. I know, that\u2019s horrible.\n\nAfter Julian graduated, the cycle just sort of continued. Stressful shit, me trying to help him rationalize. Rinse and repeat. Julian would also periodically try to convince me that my other close friends, J, C, and D, were all scum and I should drop them. This despite him never trying to know them. \n\nEventually, another mutual friend of ours, we\u2019ll call him V, showed his real colors as a manipulative narcissist, conveniently after Julian helped him get with Julian\u2019s gf\u2019s sister (V basically needed instructions the same way that Patrick gave to SpongeBob for driving). Started making life hell for both of us, but mostly Julian. It all came to a head a week ago after several months. I tried to reach out to Julian\u2019s gf about it since Julian\u2019s \u201chandle it myself\u201d attitude (and some infantilizing of her tbh) led him to never confiding in her before V could plant his seeds of manipulation. \n\nJulian freaked out when I told him. Said I ruined everything. Came up with another damage control scheme that involved going nc with me for a while. That caused me to look at things very objectively. So I drafted up a big ass note condemning our friendship yet wishing him the best, had C (who is pursuing s doctorate in psych) look at it, and then sent it before blocking on Julian.\n\nSo far, my stress levels have been noticably lower, despite my dad\u2019s health being horrible at the same time and being in the hospital. That\u2019s right. My dad\u2019s chronic bad health was less stressful than Julian.",

As I got to know her more, I grew less and less romantically interested, as she had emotional issues and instability that made me not want to do more than be friends. We maintained a friendship while we were in graduate school on opposite sides of the country. I had a conference to attend in her state, and we made plans to hang out. This involved me ditching the conference for a day, taking a 3 hour train ride, plus a subway ride to meet her. She just no showed without calling or texting. I was really hurt, and mad that I missed cool science presentations. Shortly after that, I got engaged and shared the news on social media. She followed up by sending me this long love letter, confessing her love for me, which kinda came out of nowhere and blindsided me. It felt like her just trying to sabotage my happiness. Since I'd been doing all the work of maintaining our long distance friendship, I just stopped doing the work. She never made an effort to seek me out, or reach out to me, so I just matched her energy.",

            "comment": "The breaking point for me with one of my best friends was a weekend trip away with a bunch of friends for my birthday. I'd rented a couple beach houses for all of us for the weekend. I picked him up and drove us down there. We did a murder mystery game on the second night that I'd been planning on doing for ages, and we had a great time.\n\nAfter the game we decided to play a board game, now he'd been a bit off earlier in the day but he'd been fine during the murder mystery game, engaged and enjoying himself. He kind of zoned out during the second game so I called his name a few times to get his attention. When he finally realised I was talking to him he just snapped - like complete mood change. Slammed his hand down on the board game which sent pieces flying everywhere and then stormed off.\n\nThe rest of us just sat in confusion, and it really spoiled the rest of the night. We all went to bed. I figured he'd settle the next day, apologise and it would be done with. Instead he ignored me the whole time we were all packing and cleaning up, he went to friends of mine to ask for a ride home which they told me about because he didn't have the decency to talk to me - they had to go out of their way to drop him home, while I was literally driving past his house to get to mine. He got in their car and literally ignored me trying to speak to him.\n\nI decided that I wasn't going to be treated like that, and decided to wait till he reached out and apologised. He never reached out to me ever again.\n\nIn the long run I realised that even though I missed our friendship I was much better off without him. He'd been in love with me, and I only liked him as a friend. Now this was back in '09, maybe 2010, so we didn't have a term for it yet but by today's standards he'd be considered a proper Neckbeard Incel - wore a Fedora and a duster coat, called woman M'lady, had all sorts of pet nicknames for me that infantilised me like \"kitten\" \"princess\" etc - treated me like I'd break, physically would stop with his arm from crossing the road if a single car could be seen anywhere on the road... He was cloying and clingy, and it wasn't a healthy friendship in the slightest.\n\nI realised that I could breathe again, that I could be myself without having him projecting his image of me on to me, making me be his \"perfect woman to be taken care of\". I hadn't even realised how much pressure I felt from him until it was gone. I've seen him around a few times since then, and he just looks so  miserable and depressed that it's literally palpable when you stand anywhere near him. So relieved it's not my job or responsibility to cheer him up anymore, that's another pressure he put on me I hadn't even realised - he made it my responsibility to pull him out of his head and get him in a better mood.",

He blamed everyone and would make SM posts constantly about partying with athletes and hot chicks, his Mercedes (that he wrecked and was gonna be getting back any day now), how much he\u2019d spent on this or that (while living on everyone\u2019s couches), etc. Just toxic. \n\nHe was considering moving to our area to start over (because that\u2019s a great idea\u2026being broke and jobless in the Bay Area) and I had little kids and just couldn\u2019t have him around them. He had lost yet another cell phone account and I just never got his new number. Around the same time, I stopped using FB for work and hadn\u2019t really used it personally for a while, and that was out last connection.\n\nNo clue how he\u2019s doing. I\u2019ll get a contact every now and then and it\u2019s always the same. Everyone is against him, no one believes in him, everyone left him out in the cold, but they\u2019ll all see! Never takes responsibility for anything. Moved to the Midwest with his dad once he could legally leave the state, I think. \n\nKid needed to be in a small town and couldn\u2019t handle the city. I hope he\u2019s found some girl and he\u2019s happy but I suspect he can never really let himself be. Chronic clout chaser. \n\nI love you, buddy. I hope you find peace. \n\n(Also, all good over here. Great new job. Kids are amazing. Wife killing it at work. Sometimes you have to cut the lines to the anchors.)",

Then he got his shit together a bit more and we hung out more. Then the same kinda shit happened.

It was a series of numbers. The teacher explained to Dave - born Jewish - about the Holocaust. He said \"if you can't sing for all the souls who went up the chimneys with a song in their hearts, sing so that you don't go up a chimney with a song in yours.\"\n\nDiamond Dave didn't fuck around after that. As he explained it, there's a difference between falling off a building and *throwing yourself* off a building, and he always threw himself off - hence, \"might as well jump.\" If he was going to dance, he was going to dance the night away. He even wrote a song about how he wants to get it on with Lady Liberty.\n\nDLR-era Van Halen were massively popular, but today they're so underrated. Time and shifts in popular culture did them wrong, but there's just no arguing with \"Panama.\"",

                            "comment": "I think it goes to show how open to interpretation art can be that Dancing Queen is a sad song to some. \n\nFrom the perspective that the song implies an audience watching the dancing queen, I understand the idea is that they've probably lost their own youth and the time of their lives is already in the past. I can see how we might be listening to someone sadly regretting their age with this point of view.\n\nBut even when we're in the position of watching this younger person having one of the best nights they ever will, knowing that we might not have those nights ever again, I'm inclined to be a lot more appreciative about the whole situation - \"it's great that teenagers can enjoy themselves like this, like I used to enjoy myself when I was their age\" kinda vibes.\n\nThe fact that the lyrics and harmonies on their face are pretty upbeat and positive pushes me further onto the happy side of the debate. It's true that you can read something depressing into the song by analyzing it, but does that deeper analysis truly answer what the song is about? Is that interpretation more valid than the idea that we're just happily looking on a wonderful dancer having a great time?",

So tied into routines that life is stagnant and boring. The person we were 8 years ago isn\u2019t the person we are today, but we don\u2019t want to admit that to people in our lives because things are *technically* going well so why rock the boat? \n\nThis is a song about two people realizing that it\u2019s okay to grow and change over the years, that traditionally negative qualities can be just as great as the two kids with a white picket fence life. Not wanting to conform doesn\u2019t have to be awful. \n\nWe can always learn new things about the people we love and think we know inside and out, if we have the courage to be honest. \n\nIt\u2019s telling that when they meet up they\u2019re not just like \u201coh this sucks.\u201d they go \u201coh? I had no idea\u201d and run off together on a new journey.\n\n(Also wanna point out, he doesn\u2019t take out an ad, he is responding to the ad that she put in the paper)",

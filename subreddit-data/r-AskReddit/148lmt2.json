On the one hand, if you were trying to remember the name of an actor who was in an old TV show, you could maybe look through an almanac of some kind or scour through some old copies of TV guide at the library or something, but mostly: you just had to hope it would come to you. The internet has definitely solved that problem.  \nOn the other hand, we all had that one friend who was in our friend group because he had a Nintendo or a trampoline or a pool or HBO. He (or she) was basically a dick that we put up with, because they had basically bought their popularity (or their parents had,) so you tolerated their bullshit in order to hang out with your other friends. But home was a place where you didn't have to deal with that jerk for a few hours or days. Social media has changed that. Kids today have a harder time getting away from the a-holes and bullies in their lives.",

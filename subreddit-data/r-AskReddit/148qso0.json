Increase it to another 2 if you like the next week. \nSame applies to if you want to start reading but hate reading. Read for literally 120 seconds a day for a week. Then make it 240 seconds the next week. It\u2019s not the action that you find hard, it\u2019s the new routine you find hard. So if you can add something new to your routine just by 120 seconds, you will find the action easier and easier. Works 100% of the times.",

My alarm clock is a backup in case the power goes out. I don't dread the process of waking up anymore.\n\nIf you're able to control your room's temperature with a timer you can also gently make it warmer in the morning hours. This helps me in the winter or if I use my AC in the summer.\n\nMake sure you give yourself enough time to sleep based on your age.\n\nAvoid doing things that make sleeping ineffective. Drinking liquids a few hours before bed. Using substances like caffeine, alcohol or weed that reduce the quality of your REM sleep close to bedtime.\n\nLike all habits consistency is key, but don't feel guilty if you miss a couple of days.\n\nIf you're suspicious that anxiety or depression are possibly contributing reasons for your desire to stay in bed later, you need to work with a professional to address that if you can or be more forgiving to yourself if adopting this habit takes longer.\n\nGood luck.",

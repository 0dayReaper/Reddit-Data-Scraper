            "comment": "This happened to me. It was \u20ac750, at the time (summer 2013) worth about $980 USD.\n\nI bought a laptop from Dell, and from day 1 it was so riddled with problems, it was unusable. The simplest tasks took forever. Wifi, Ethernet and more crashed continuously, requiring a full power cycle to work again. Formatting &amp; reinstalling Windows did nothing. Worst of all, Dell support did nothing but delay and delay.\n\nOne day I finally managed to have a Dell tech over to check it out. He confirmed the countless issues and called up Dell to say I require a replacement. I wait. He hangs up, and looks at me. \"Sorry... Red light\" (= no-go). And he had to leave me with this quite literal brick.\n\nLate last year I found out that as consumer in the EU (The Netherlands specifically) I am well protected against this. I consulted with a bureau, and they believe that even though so much time has now passed, with such an extreme case, I am still able to get my $1000 back if I pursue it.\n\nSo that's exactly what I'm doing. I'm getting my money back from them, one way or another. Dell can go fuck themselves.\n\nEdit: definition of \"red light\" added\n\nEdit 2: Gold?! Thank you! Honestly, I thought this would get burried, but as a returning Dell customer that they royally screwed over, I'm happy this is getting the attention it is. No company should treat their customers like this. ",

For anyone who has recurring issues and you can't seem to get any help, tell the next tech support agent you talk to that when you turned it on, it started smoking. If you need more, mention the smell of hot electronics. One thing Dell DOESN'T want is a lawsuit because their faulty machine burned someone's house down.\n\nThis used to work on any Dell system, laptop or desktop and no matter the age, they'd replace it, typically with a close equivalent refurb so make sure you aren't going to get shafted by getting something worth less than you paid for.\n\nAnother thing, technically this is fraud if you do it, but if they can't fix their lemons, get them to make you lemonade.\n\nEdit: First silver!

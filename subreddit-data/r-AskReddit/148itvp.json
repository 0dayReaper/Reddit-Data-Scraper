Try to always wake up at approximately the same time. Try to eat meals at approximately the same time (this will also help you regulate your weight and not gain a bunch of weight). Try to shower, gym, work, etc at the same time.\n\nPretty quickly it becomes second nature and you just do it by rote rather than having to actually think about it. That gives you time to think about the non-mundane things you need to focus on (like school work, or your social life, or your job, or whatever).",

The amount of money you'll waste getting  things in bulk and wasting them will cripple you, where if you plan a day ahead and just grab what you need the day before, your always ahead with fresh food.  Its a time investment each day but is really well worth it",

But produce, bread, milk, etc. Buy smaller quantities, it's tough for a single person to get through everything and a lot of stuff will sit forgotten and go bad. You don't want to throw away money",

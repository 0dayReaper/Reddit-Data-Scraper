And he also didn't want it to be meaningless.\n We were good virtual friends for 6 years before I fell madly in love for him, once we started visiting each other.\n\nI think it depends on the mindset and the reasons why someone is a virgin in their late 30s. I can see how it could be a bad thing if its because the person has, for instance, serious personality issues or bad hygiene.\n\nBut if it's because of religion, or shyness, or they just never met someone special it shouldn't matter. And anyone that makes fun of someone for the simple fact of having no interest to sleep around or pay for sex doesn't deserve a loving relationship until they fix their inner bully selves.\n\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to add what I think of the situation in general...",

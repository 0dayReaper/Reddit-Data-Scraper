            "comment": "nothing has changed but a lot has actually changed.\n\n I realized that I didn't really know the people I knew during the pandemic process. For example, my ex-bf cheated on me because we couldn't see each other when the pandemic started(\u2620\ufe0f). None of my friends reacted, nor did they stand behind me. They even became close friends with her, whom he cheated on me with. I felt so stupid. When they were with me, they always talk about how toxic my ex was, but with my ex, they were pretend not to talk behind his back. Since then, I've learned not to place too much value on people. If this had happened to them, I would stand behind them. That is the most painful part.. \n\nIn short, my perspective towards people has changed. I unwittingly view everyone as a potential cheater. That's can be bad, but at least I'm not disappointed anymore. Other than that, a lot of things have changed, but as I said, nothing has changed\ud83e\udee0",

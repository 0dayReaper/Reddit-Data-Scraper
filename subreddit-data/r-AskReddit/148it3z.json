It's what you do around the consumption of weed that makes the experience enjoyable, just like what you do around the consumption of food makes the experience more enjoyable. If you're just vegging out and staring blankly at one another it doesn't matter if you're smoking weed or eating, neither activity would be a fun first date.\n\nThat being said, I've never consumed weed that was better than my best food experience, though I've consumed food after smoking weed that made the overall experience much more enjoyable.",

A restaurant is a building in which they serve food, weed is just a drug that needs to be consumed to enjoy the effects. There's a restaurant near my house that makes amazing food and has a big retro arcade. I love going there, drinking a few craft beers, and dumping tokens into The Simpson arcade game or X-Men. Maybe even smoking before going there to enjoy the food that much more, but the restaurant on its own is more fun than weed on its own.",

A restaurant *can* be fun if it has things in it that you find fun. A restaurant can be literally anything, it could be a small venue with 4 tables, in a dimly lit room no louder than a library. It doesn't have to be bright, crowded, or noisy. But weed is just weed, it only does one thing, you have to bring the fun yourself.",

            "comment": "Met a girl online on AOL (yes, this was a while ago).  She was in sophomore in college and I was in my gap year before going to the same college.\n\nWe went to the park, walked around, chatted, everything is cool.  She insisted on eating cheap, which was fine, so we ate at a fast food place.  Pleasant enough conversation, and we were supposed to end there, but then she said she wanted to watch a movie back at her apartment.\n\nUh, ok, I say, and we drive back to her place.  Her entire bedroom is *filled* with Disney stuff.  Like, just packed.  Even with, like, Disney bedsheets.  And the movie she wanted to watch?  A choice between *Sleeping Beauty* and *Beauty and the Beast,* although she had on VHS (yes, this was a while ago), every animated Disney movie.  Keep in mind she's 20 or 21 at this point.  And I'm 19.\n\nWe started *Sleeping Beauty* and she just started to recite the dialogue verbatim, with inflection, for almost every scene in the movie.  \n\nI was getting really weirded out by this point.  One of her friends called and asked to come over to drop off something for an assignment.  By this point, I was looking for any sort of polite escape plan, so when they stopped in, I basically said, well, it's been fun, but I don't want to interrupt your homework/project.  \n\nGot out of there and never looked back.  We chatted a few more times, and I got a few more Disney movie invites, but I kind of politely declined.  I don't think I've experienced the shift from \"attractive\" to \"really creepy\" so quickly.\n\nOnly other competitor was when a friend hooked me up with a girl he knew and it turned out she was actually a girl I knew from high school who was quite the bully.  She never bullied me, but she had quite the reputation.  Oh well.  Waited for the general awkwardness to subside during the dinner, and it did, but she was just absolutely fascinated by the mafia and everything having to do with the 1920s mafia stuff.  She kept talking about it.\n\nNice enough dinner, though, but I'm not interested.  Walk her out to her car and she points to her bumper sticker which has some words on it that are nonsensical.  She says that the person who understands this will be the person she marries.  I say, well, it's not me, and she says: oh, it's about the mafia.  I'm about to say \"of course,\" but then I realize she's been feeding me \"hints\" all through dinner for this moment, and then I realize that I hadn't paid attention to a damned word she said about the mafia.\n\nI eventually say I'll think back on it, but she's clearly pissed at this point, and she tells me not to bother.  I almost run to my car.",

I was pretty embarrassed as it had to have been obvious even though I didn't verbalize what was going on.  Then I walked him out to his car, feeling gross, and he decides to kiss me!  Don't know where that came from, as I was definitely not being flirty or anything.  I was just kinda like \"ok well thanks for dinner, see you later\", then wiped my mouth off with my hand as I walked back inside.

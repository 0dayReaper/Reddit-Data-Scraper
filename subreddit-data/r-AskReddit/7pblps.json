I was bopping my head, instead of the utter embarrassment her friends started dancing around, and I've become the \"cool\" dad. Now I've gotta do this all the time when I get her from school. Its also led to her friends coming over all the time and listening to music at top volume. My daughter trolled me while I was trying to troll her. Be careful it backfires. ",

There a guy there with a ~5 year old son and he's trying to convince his kid that he's a real ninja that went to ninja school. His kid wasn't buying it, but you'd got was selling it hard.\n\nI took my daughter over and said \"Sweetie, do you want to meet a real ninja?\" And pointed to the guy. His son looked a bit confused and told my daughter how I met him in ninja school and that he was the greatest ninja they ever taught. That little kid lit up \"Daddy, you're really a ninja?!?\" The guy just smiled at me and said \"I would never lie about something this important. Of course I am.\"\n\nThat kid is going to tell all of how friends that his dad is a real ninja for at least a month.\n\nEdit: thank you too the two awesome people that gilded my comment and to the thousands that upvoted as well. I didn't realize such a simple story would be so popular, but I'll have to share more.\n\nPlease, keep your goofy dad stories pouring in, I'm loving the ideas for when my kids get older. ",

To clarify, my wife didn't make me stop telling him, she made me quit being Spider-Man. She also steals my hair at night (I'm balding). His usual response to our comments about being a groundhog is general denial, leading up to \"I. Am not. A GROUNDHOG!\". We agree, and correct him that he just *used to be* a groundhog. \n\nWhen our oldest was about 5, I brought a large egg shaped rock home from a camping trip in Canada, and told him it was a moose egg. We couldn't keep it on a windowsill or by the heat register, or it might hatch. He started to take it to school for show and tell one day, and I had to admit to the story, I didn't think it would play out well in the classroom.",

He was nice, but a little creepy at times because he seemed to forget most of his coworkers were girls half his age. \n\nI asked my friend who also worked there to tie my shoe because I\u2019d hurt my knee and couldn\u2019t bend down very easily. \n\nThe older man turns around, sees her tying my shoe, and says all surprised \u201coh you actually meant tie my shoe. I assumed that was an innuendo for something.\u201d\n\nI was mostly confused as to *what* he thought \u201ctie my shoe\u201d was an innuendo and why I would be saying it to my friend at work in the middle of the dinner rush.

I am walking my daughter towards the meeting place and we see her friend and friend's dad walking towards us from the opposite direction. This is on a busy mall area in front of a cinema complex. They run towards each other and start gabbing on like teenagers do, this is where the fun starts...\n\n\nThe friend's dad an I look at each other then burst out with a high pitched scream and run towards each other into an enthusiastic embrace. Some of the comments we made are as follows:\n\n\n\"OMG, you look fab!\"\n\"Oh, it's all you bae!\"\n\"What have you done to your hair? I LOVE it!\"\netc...\n\n\nWe are both 35-40yo grown men carrying on about how good the other looks and all the rest of it. The blood drained from both daughters' faces and you could literally see them thinking \"just kill me now...\"\n\n\nIt was glorious! 10/10 would recommend\n\n\n\nEDIT: First gold!! Thanks reddit, does that mean I win the internets today?!?\n\n\nEDIT 2: The other dad and I know each other from a local church and we are both jokers. It was a cosmic alignment thing... On another note, I wore a topknot in public today to further embarrass them. Being a dad rocks!!",

I saw him the other night at a ball game and he kissed my 43 year old scruffy cheek with no kids around. I\u2019m pretty sure his wife thinks we\u2019re sleeping together now. ",

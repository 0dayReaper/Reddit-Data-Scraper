Shaggy is not a particularly good owner, half the time he doesn't even have dog food for Scooby. And Scooby isn't a particularly good dog because he's not all that brave, but at night they curl up and hold each other. It makes me feel happy for them to have found each other in this crazy world and to have that someone in their life that loves them.",

A heavy smoker, they were very seriously ill in hospital. \n\nI said 'I bet you're desperate for a smoke!' and their reply was that they weren't, and in fact had given it up.\n\nThis surprised us both until we discovered that the patient had been treated with a nicotine patch. Worked perfectly!",

Superman says \u201cyou got me wrong. Im not threatening you. Im telling you you have 6 months to live\u201d. Woke me up and made me quit cold turkey. I had bad cravings for 2 weeks.\n\n1 year later i started again, and i smoked for 1 year. I gradually quit, going from normal to slim, from 10 cigarettes to 9 per day, and also telling myself daily that I\u2019m doing an active, conscious choice to quit because it is hurting my fitness levels. When the day came to have my last cigarette, i took that last puff peacefully. No cravings after. \n\n5 year free let\u2019s gooooo",

That's probably the only reason why he admitted to such unconventional cleaning methods\u2026 *he had to come clean.*\n\nHe offered to buy me a replacement drill, but I've asked for a cash value instead. Bought myself a set of replacement bearings, new battery pack, then blasted a chuck with rust inhibitor and now I have a \"like new\" drill plus quite a bit of spare change. And a neighbor that always cleans his gardening tools in a dishwasher.",

Thrilled to have you, truly.  You\u2019re gonna be easy to manage and I know you\u2019re not gonna get wasted. \n\nThat being said, club soda costs very little and you probably get free refills.   \nSo if you go to a bar and just drink club soda, make sure you tip your bartender appropriately. If you hang out for two hours and have 5 club sodas you\u2019ll get a bill for like $4.   This means the 20% rule no longer applies.   Try to throw your bartender a buck each time they bring you another club soda.   It\u2019ll only cost you a few dollars and no bartender will scoff at $1 per drink. They\u2019ll be thrilled. \nIf you\u2019re hanging out at a bar within a restaurant, the bartender probably makes more money off of people dining at the bar. If someone wants to sit at my bar for dinner and can\u2019t because Steve is here sitting with his club soda I might ask Steve to stand up. I love Steve and I want him here but this other guy wants a steak and a bottle of wine and that\u2019s good real estate.\n\nI love my bar regulars who don\u2019t drink and they keep me and my bottom line in mind. \n\nSo come hang at my bar!",

It's not even a date, just two people (who are in the market to meet someone) having a conversation and seeing if there is potential chemistry.\n\nThis was when I was single in my early 40's after a divorce. \n\nI was up front; a first meeting would be the same as if we were both in line at Starbucks and we struck up a conversation in line, got our coffee and kept talking. This was one way people met in the great before online dating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdvantages to this approach, even if you buy, you are out less than $20. You aren't locked into a long activity if the spark isn't there. Dinner you are captive till the meal is done. It reduces the pressure of being a 'date', but you know that the other person is (likely) available if things go well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most important thing (I think) is that you go into it with zero expectations and with only the goal of spending some time getting to know another human being.",

Made some close acquaintances in NA early on, but so many of my friends have died that I think my brain just doesn't let me get close enough to anyone to be friends. I quit going to NA after a few years clean and while I greatly appreciate the support I got from the rooms early on, I just kind of drifted away from it.\n\nIt's weird. I've always been a really sociable person and I had so many friends in high school. I went to prison for a while in my early twenties and my cell mate, a guy in his 60s, told me that you can only count your true friends on one hand and you can find out who they are by calling them from prison and seeing if they answer. Only two of them answered and they're both dead now. I still sometimes talk to a guy I was really close with for most of my childhood, but we don't hang out or anything.\n\nI have a girlfriend and I play Destiny online with a few people pretty regularly. They're probably the closest thing I have to friends. I just don't see myself ever making new friends and, honestly, I'm not even very sad about that. Maybe it was all the time in jails, prison, and rehabs, but I just kind of learned to be okay alone. I didn't get any other choice, y'know?",

Evening classes are a GREAT place to make new friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen - and I know everyone's workplace is different, certainly mine is very easy to make friends - through work you can make some nice friends.  Sit with people at lunch hour instead of eating at your desk or in your car - chat to people during the work day and find out things about them - if they have a family, if THEY have any hobbies etc.  Then, when you build up a bit of friendliness ask them if they'd like to go for lunch or (yes I know, AGAIN!) a coffee after work and so forth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt definitely helps to be friendly and outgoing.  I'm not naturally outgoing but I am naturally a very friendly person so I guess that makes me approachable.  So try to be approachable and learn the art of small, friendly talk.",

I was 19, just moved to a new city from the middle of nowhere, it was a huge step for me and I was basically alone.  I was on public transportation heading to a job interview at a call center that was hiring multiple positions, I figured it was an easy score to get on my feet so i headed out.  A guy sitting diagonally from me when I sat down, we kept making eye contact randomly for some reason. I mean i could really feel this guy's energy. We eventually got to my bus stop, and to my surprise, he stood up too. When we got off the bus he took off his headphones and asked if i had an interview as I was clearly dressed up for it and I said, yeah what about you? \n\nA huge conversation kicked off as we realized we were going to the same job interview and we had literally everything in common and both just moved to this new city. It was literally the universes work and it still boggles our brains to think about to this day.\n\nTLDR; Met one of my best friends as a stranger going to the same job interview on public transportation\n\nEDIT: We both got the job! :)",

Basically the goal is to meet new people. Seek discomfort is a good phrase and a good model presentation of how to meet new people. Google their  YouTube channel.\n\nHobbies can be good but it's hard to find the small groups that have no internet presence. Volunteering, charity work, etc is more aimed at helping x, while you benefit in socializing. \n\nMy anecdote, others may vary. \nThe other fishing, hunting, etc group's come from making connections. Door knocking, leaving letter etc asking for permission and slowly building a blue book of properties to hunt n fish while cleaning up there property in return. Plus you can ask if they want me to take anyone in their family with me or can I bring a person over etc after trust is built. \n\nLastly, if anyone reads my handle. It's okay to be alone. I'm alone but not lonely. I have reddit to come socialize with you assholes :). But fr it's okay to only have a hand few friends you connect with. The key aspect of friendship is respect. If they don't respect your time nor you as a person as you do them. They aren't your friend.\n\nEdit: the yt channel isn't seek discomfort (that's there catch phrase) it is \"Yes Theory\" without the quotations. \n\nhttps://youtube.com/c/YesTheory",

It's significantly easier to make friends and connect (especially if you're shy) if you have mutual interests, even if you don't share the same level of enjoyment in the hobby. It's also a great way to get closer to someone if you do already know them, and opens up an opportunity to have them talk about themselves so you can learn more about them and who they are.",

Over time, those greetings turn to questions about what they are doing vs what you are doing. Taking the time to listen to them is almost more important than having something interesting to say in return. \n\nFriendships aren't a physical achievement. They aren't something that should even be focused on or forced. If you focus on being interested in what another person says and show it in the way you act and speak, they are more likely to speak to you again. Then at some point you will realize that that person is your friend as that process repeats itself and more casual and personal things are exchanged and spoken of.\n\nThis is exactly how I befriended a guy more than double my age. We now share big fish catches and cool dinners we made. It's a friendship that still surprises me and it makes me feel good. It happens whether you think of it or not. It's a process not a destination.\n\nEdit: thanks for my first reddit gold!",

The more people who ask, the more likely we are to implement it.\n\nAt the very least you can walk away with a good book and a librarian happy to talk your ear off about books ;)\n\nSource: am librarian!",

I got kind of isolated and started developing interests around solitary activities. All my activities were solitary, so I never met anyone. It's a positive feedback loop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou need to actively engage in shared activities that put you in regular contact with the same group of people. For me, it was social dancing. I started taking classes and going to social dances; I'd run into the same groups of people all the time. When I'd recognize someone from class outside of work, say in the grocery store, I'd go out of my way to say hello, even just a quick 'Hey there'. This was a very slow process. I eventually made a couple friends that were better than acquaintances, but it took at about a year. I also met a few people that just didn't like me for some reason - seems to me living in solitude long enough you get more sensitive to the negative judgements of others. It often became frustrating how little progress I was making in the friend department. I considered giving up and just taking to hermitude many times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou don't need to take up social dancing. The key is getting involved in a group of some kind, and seeing the same group of people frequently. If you're not a talker , like me, a shared activity can help get around all that awkward superficial small talk. Some people won't like you, but you can overcome that.",

I do drink. My wife doesn\u2019t. Here\u2019s the thing in your thirties. Y\u2019all go to a brewery or some such (well not so much lately) and the whole group will always have a few people not drinking for any or all of the following reasons:\n-driving\n-pregnant\n-on a prescription that makes it inadvisable \n-don\u2019t feel like it\n-don\u2019t like what\u2019s available\n-the flesh drinks only blood\n\nAnd generally no one cares if they\u2019re a mature group worth hanging out with. \n\nHeres the question to ask: do you mean that you only want to hang out in situations where people aren\u2019t drinking? That\u2019s a different thing and a bit more limiting.\n\nBut seriously: mature adults deal with all sorts of reasons people won\u2019t drink. This isn\u2019t college. No one thinks your coolness is derived from crushing Miller lites. The only people I\u2019ve ever seen ostracized from a group of adults are people who are unpleasant: most frequently because they drank way too much.\n\nEdit: and honestly, in college no one worth hanging out with cared either.",

When you talk to people, strangers, coworkers etc... be your 100% genuine self, this should help you avoid being a doormat. If you find you're still a doormat you should revisit step 1. \n\nMy best friend and I really only share a couple things, our love of gangster rap and 90s hardcore punk, and our beliefs in undying, over the top self empowerment. \n\nThat's not exactly shit I hear people talking about at parties, \"oh yeah on my way over I was bumping some fuckin Mc Breed and yelling at myself in the rear view \"LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE DONT WITH YOUR LIFE MOTHERFUCKER, HOW FAR YOUVE COME, KEEP FUCKING GOING, CRUSH THE OPPOSITION BITCH LETS GO!!!\"\" \n\nLike I said, be your 100% genuine self.",

You can receive them from all over the world and 99% of people use it to make friends (over looking for a partner like most meeting apps). You enter in your hobbies, maybe put in the countries, gender, age of the people you want to talk to (i left it open and received beautiful letters from aged people wanting to talk to someone), and there you go! I have met my two best friends there, one from germany and one from brazil, we've been talking for years now. It's too much work for scammers, so everyone is genuine. I can never not recommend it.",

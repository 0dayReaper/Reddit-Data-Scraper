Quantum Mechanics is an extremely well-supported field of study, with predictive power, but no one understands it.  Many of us pine for an elegant construction that would hit all the data points while being comprehensible.  When I said \"best argument against quantum mechanics\", I meant \"best argument that a simpler, more elegant theory is possible, that can subsume Quantum Mechanics.\"  And by \"best\", I mean approximately \"only\".  As it stands, all our evidence points to the chaos of Quantum Mechanics being the true nature of reality at that scale.",

Lately campaigns seem to address issues in terms of \"here's how I'd fix this if I was the Supreme Leader\". They basically talk about what they want to do as if Congress and the courts don't exist, and we're supposed to get excited and pretend they have the power to actually do any of this. Generally candidates don't even have clear plans to reach their goals, much less describe a plausible tactic for getting the rest of the federal government to go along with all of it.",

And, obviously, same with Romney (I'd say Trump, but he really doesn't have positions). \n\nIt's not about swaying voters, it's about entrenching them. I distinctly remember during the 2012 elections, I had a friend who hid the fact that she voted for Romney based on his positions over Obama, because of the cultural perception at the time. How many people vote a certain way because their family, friends, and coworkers are loud about who should be voted for rather then their own decision?\n\nI agree with your second part. Debates do need to be less of a circus and reflect more on the seriousness of the matter by independent committees.",

The medium of TV can only really express entertainment well. There is no reason to have exciting music on the news, except for the entertainment value.\n\nTelevision, as a communication medium, affects human psychology in such a way that it is almost exclusively entertainment. It can only do non-entertainment communication incedentally. You can try to use it for education, but it doesn't work. That's not the fault of the TV watchers or producers, but the technology itself. \n\nNow, the producers of television content are certainly to blame for the exploitative and manipulative tactics they employ to hook people on their entertainment drug, but they cannot be blamed for failing to make TV do something that it cannot do.",

Just because they had more substantive debate doesn't mean that's what people listened to. In that example, radio listeners thought Nixon won the debate because he gave better arguments, but TV viewers overwhelmingly favored JFK because he looked better televised. Ultimately it comes down to constituents/voters, and candidates have just learned the game better in the last 60 years",

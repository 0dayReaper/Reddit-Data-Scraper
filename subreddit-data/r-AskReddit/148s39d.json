It was common practice to lend the keys to non-authorised nursing assistants so they could retrieve the Blood pressure monitors and such. It was one of my colleagues who borrowed the key off me but management immediately accused me and the police arrested me. After the incident I stepped down as medication tech and now work only as a nursing assistant as I do not trust management anymore.",

The first theories would likely be that of some sort of timed bioweapon test, released into the atmosphere, albeit a strange one.  Then the religions would start trying to explain things - and more would start popping up.  Depending on the severity of the global reaction, it may start wars - more repressed countries, especially the middle east, might very well start a few vs whoever they blame.  \n\nPerhaps some small scale testing first though, yeah.\n\nAlso, discover if it *has* to be you that triggers the effect, live, or if it can be a recording.  If it can be, does it HAVE to include video, or just audio?  If its video, can you set an image in front of the screen, and trigger it that way?  If so, you could potentially lock down the world (or a few individuals) with orgasms, just by playing it on repeat. If that video were to get released online... well, thats a recipe for global chaos.\n\nAdditional thoughts: Does the affect have travel time, or is it instant?  How large is the area of affect, or the range? Could you, perhaps, accidentally trigger it on an alien world without knowing it? Can you control duration? \n\nIf you could, and all of the above are possible, you could set up an automated instant interplanetary communication system, though it would require a biological component, a person. By triggering short bursts of climax, you could set up an interplanetary orgasm telegraph - short and long bursts, using morse code, vs an 'operator' that receives 'messages' transmitted via automated systems through the use of recording of the finger-gun 'pew' aimed at specific pre-determined points in space.  It would be slow, but FTL communication would be worth it.  I also imagine you would have any number of people volunteering for the position.  \n\nAlso, yes, I am this bored that I put that much thought into it.",

I mean, surely it won't just be the boys constantly creaming their cargos. Surely the ladies will be supersoaking their slizz snugglers and need to wear some manner of sex-grade diaper or possibly just go full skirt and let the drips drops where they may.\n\nYes, the world at large will be hot and humid with the musk of human sexual excretion. Unlike the Rick Roll, the Jizz Roll will turn into something you want to sit though each and every time and the negative stigma of openly slinging goo or gushing drool will be gone. Thanks to me, the world will be in a near constant state of blissful relief and post-nut clarity. I suspect the world will make huge strides in technological advancements, as well as find unity among races and religions. Civil strife will be a thing of the past when you watch a Jizz Roll and let your stuff blast.\n\nOh sure, even in my old age, people will want my celebrity for personal hire. Some may call them masochists, but I see these elites rich enough to afford an in person pewing as just regular folk trying to ascend to a sexual nirvana. I'd pin them against the wall, or they would do so themselves as their legs won't be doing them much good for much long, as I relentlessly pew them into oblivion. I'd pew them stupid if that's what they want. I'd pew them until their genitals are tender and throbbing from overuse, bright red like a piece of steel hammered hot by a master blacksmyth. As they sit there, blathering incoherently, giggling and lost on a different plane of conscious existence, I'll shoot 'em one more pew for the road. If they die they die.\n\nThat's what I was hired for and that's the power I've been blessed with.",

Aboard the docked USS Arizona, the crowd is settling into their seats below flags, flowers, and the headshot of the leading presidential candidate\n\nThe camera tracks a seagull past the ship, through the docks, and to a high rise building where i slip past security with a briefcase. When the elevator door closes, i shed my street clothes and reveal a skin-tight black catsuit. Opening a hatch atop the elevator, I toss up the briefcase and gracefully pull myself through it. As the elevator continues to climb, I put on sunglasses and a ripoff of the mission impossible theme swells.\n\nI sneak through elevator shafts and drop into a penthouse apartment in the top floor overlooking the bay. Thousands of yards below, a security details prepares to bring out the president. \n\nAs he slowly walks up the ramp to the podium, I take aim with my finger gun. Pretending to turn dials and making clicking noises with my mouth. I imagine crosshairs being lowered right on his heart as the crowd erupts in cheers. \n\nAs i take a deep breath, the camera flips to a frontal shot of the podium. As the president begins to speak...\n\n*PEW*",

I'm careful with my power now, but now and again I have to fingerbang someone into submission just to escape. \n\nMy exile from the real world is made worse when trolls across the internet use my first newscast as a new kind of Rickroll. uBlock Origin creates a specialized widget that censors my fignerblasting so that offices and schools can return to some kind of normalcy.

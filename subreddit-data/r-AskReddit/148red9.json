We were young(20m/19f) and while we'd been together for 3 years at that point, she was pregnant and her family steamrolled us with how our day would be.\n\nBy far the worst decision ever was the recieving line.\n\nIt lasted our whole reception. Literally we broke away to have our bite of cake, then back to the line. First dance, then back to the line. Bouquet toss, back to the line.",

My mother in law asked her sister to take pictures because she had a camera with a neck strap instead of a wrist strap.  It was awkward to ask or pay someone to do it.  I spent weeks fixing the pictures, but they were just not very good.  I'd have at least hired a student photographer, if not a professional.",

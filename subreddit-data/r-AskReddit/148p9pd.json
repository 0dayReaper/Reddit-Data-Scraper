Generally, if we make a settlement offer, we give the other party 10 - 14 days to respond before we consider the offer rejected.  For more complicated requests, like discovery requests, most courts allow 30 days to respond.  No response after 60 days means they are intentionally not responding to you.  That holds true for the legal field and I think for the dating field, as well. I hope you weren't holding your breath for this one because you deserve better than just being ignored for two months.",

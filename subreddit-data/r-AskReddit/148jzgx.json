I've met this nicest and sweetest looking girl ever in my last semester, but then she just opened her mouth and it was that moment where I met the most entitled person I have ever met. Regret meeting her because she is passive aggressive and lowkey mean but gets away with it.",

I was in the hard rock having a pint and the appetizer platter for breakfast/ dinner this kiwi expat strikes up a conversation with me. Dude looked like a beach bum, straggly beard, cheap flip flops. ETC. Turned out the guy was on his retirement career which was a very large commercial glass company which had done most of the skyscrapers around us. Didn't really clock how rich he was till I asked if he knew when the cigar shop near where we were opened. He answered by calling the owner, having them open for us and treating me to a flight of cigars and matching scotches and bourbons still well above my current disposable income.",

Upon first meeting him, the guy was scary. Nobody wanted to really mess around with him the first few days of class so we were all quiet. \n\nThen one day, while he's in the middle of his lesson, he starts handing out fruit snacks to the people who raised their hands, and started telling dad jokes when he could. It didn't take long for everyone to realize he was really a super chill guy. He was probably my favorite teacher there because not only was he super chill, but had some funny stories to share and his classes were super fun. My favorite class that he taught was a Military History class where we could create our own slideshow presentations on literally anything military related. It could be about weaponry, uniforms, conflicts- literally anything.",

They\u2019re not perfect human beings of course (none of us are), but they were (and are) wonderful parents and I could not have asked for better. \n\nThey were my strongest advocates. They made sure I never felt \u2018worse\u2019 for my disability, and ensured I had the best medical care and early intervention, and that I got the best education they could afford. My Dad worked long hours but was kind and loving and there for me, he taught me logical reasoning, to love maths and patterns. My Mum took me to endless doctor\u2019s appointments and also taught me to love words and history and travel, and how to be assertive. They supported me, loved me, and encouraged me to always try my best, but also pursue things that made me happy. I have nothing but praise for them both.\n\nI\u2019m 35 now, expecting my first child, and can only hope to do as well as they did.",

She did it out of interest and love for me (she was excited for me), but it ended up making me not want to tell them about it because I was embarrassed, and then not actually ask the girl out because then I would have to tell my parents.\n\nIt caused me to be overly shy and develop social anxiety, because I didn't want to talk about it, so it was easier to avoid the whole situation.  This stuck with me for YEARS, and I avoided dating much at all because of it.  The thing that helped me was therapy, and my friends.  My friends encouraged me to do things with them, which helped a ton.  Then one of them who is overly extraverted really broke me out of my shell and told me to come with her to kickboxing.  This is where I met a woman who I've now been dating for almost a year.  Best relationship I've ever had.  I had to convince her to go out with me, but for some reason it was easy for me to talk to her despite being very shy.\n\nParents: Don't tease your kids about things like this.  If they seem shy about it, don't press the issue.  Of course if there is a concern for their safety, then definitely take that into account, but otherwise, encourage your kids to be social, and involved.",

As we speak I\u2019m stuck on the toilet from the antibiotics I\u2019ve been taking to kill the massive infection eating the bones in my face because I wasn\u2019t taught proper oral hygiene. 6 crowns, 1 failed crown that had to be turned to an implant, and surgical removal of a molar later, you\u2019d think I\u2019d have learned by now.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve inspired so many of you to go brush, that\u2019s awesome! Everyone who has dental problems, you\u2019re not alone and it\u2019s never too late to pick up good habits. Don\u2019t forget to floss and the feeling of a good mouthwash is underrated so you should try that too!\n\nAnother Edit: A lot of people are asking how it got this bad. There is a genetics factor as both of my parents and 1 set of grandparents all have horrible teeth as well. I was also never made to brush my teeth as a child, didn\u2019t go to the dentist, and it just wasn\u2019t something that we did in my house. I also didn\u2019t have health classes in school that taught the importance of it. I didn\u2019t figure it out on my own until high school, and by then the damage was already done. This latest problem (having to have an implant) was kind of just bad luck. I had a crown that slid out of place ever so slightly, to where I didn\u2019t notice it. Bacteria got in the little crack and colonized in my gums. And it doesn\u2019t matter how much you brush, you can\u2019t reach underneath your teeth. So even though I have had good habits at this point (I don\u2019t floss as much as I should though) I can\u2019t fix past damage. I also live in America where sugar is a staple and dental care is insane even with insurance. Teeth are considered luxury bones here, and unfortunately teeth are also a \u201ctoo little too late\u201d type of problem.",

Literally my dentist laughed at me( great dentist, super nice and just an all around good guy, and his nurses and assistants are all super amazing) after about the 3rd time I came back in to have like 4 more cavities filled.  He laughed because when he asked why I was so fine with all the work now versus when I only had a few cavities, I responded with being embarrassed I let it go for so long.  16 fillings and 2 root canals later I I\u2019m no longer ashamed.  Tbh I stopped being embarrassed the second I went to the dentist and said I needed help.  Start little and work your way through it, you got this.",

I've been morbidly obese for as long as I can remember due to bad eating habits and being sedentary. I've lost 62 pounds in the past three to four months from forming healthy eating habits, eating balanced meals, and getting plenty of exercise.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all of the encouraging words and awards. I got started by getting screened for mental illnesses by a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with ADHD and was put on a non stimulant medication. It's been the most life changing experience. That internal voice that talks you out of doing something is barely around anymore and I've finally started developing habits and routines that benefit me with little struggle.\n\nAlso I found an indoor recumbent exercise bike which is one of the greatest things for people who want to get a good workout that isn't hard on the back and knees. Plus the ability to watch something on my laptop while I do it is awesome.\n\nLast but not least I keep track of my eating and exercise using MyFitnessPal.",

He swore that he would not beat his children so he never beat my father. My father did not swear to not beat me because it was such an unthinkable thing to do, I suppose since he never experienced it himself. I grew up, never being beaten by my parents and never being told that they were beaten so for me beating my kids, well, obviously did not happen.\n\nMoral of the story, the first generation that don't beat their children are setting up their grand children for a great childhood.",

I thought it looked so cute. I was prob 12 or 13 and barely even had a signature. My mother and father acted like I was the biggest idiot known to mankind and an utter embarrassment. How could their daughter be so immature and embarrass them like this? I remember the verbal ABUSE went on for at least 10 minutes. They tore up the card and I didn\u2019t even bother signing it, my mom did it for me.",

By the second half of the booklet, we were marking parts of the sentence that I would never hear about again. The other teacher (same class in the same school) didn\u2019t do this. It was never going to be necessary. I actually did fine on it, but it taught me the lesson that lots of things we learn will be absolutely useless and lots of teachers, especially older teachers, are just miserable people.\n\nThe second teacher was my math teacher the next year. At the beginning of the year, he announced that if you miss any homework assignments but get a 90+ on the test, all your 0\u2019s will be changed the match your test score. The assignments were fairly easy and you got 100 if you showed your work, but like most 14 year olds, I took advantage of the rule at one point and didn\u2019t do any assignments. By the time the test rolled around, I was so stressed that I studied more than I ever had before. I ended up doing all the HW assignments anyways, plus re-reading the textbook chapters and watching YouTube videos explaining the concept in pneumonics and other memorable ways. I got an 88 but it got curved 3 points or something and I got away with it. That class taught me not to procrastinate. Can\u2019t say I always follow the lesson, but I learned a lot from that class and he was a great teacher.\n\n\nAnyways thanks for coming to my TED talk",

We had to eat everything on our plates or we were seen as \"ungrateful\", despite the fact that our family was relatively affluent and food wastage wasn't really an issue. Might go some way towards explaining why we were all overweight by the time we hit our teen years.",

If the worry is that they filled up on junk food, or will eat it later if they don't eat their dinner, just don't make it an option.\n\nFood shouldn't be a chore, obligation or punishment. It should be functional at times, and a blessing whenever possible.",

I am certain this had a major change on my development.  Therefore, set up a Plex server where I can give junior me access to all the shows and he wants -- ad free.\n* Spend lots of early time teaching and enriching.  Sit with him to work on homework.  Math was hard for me, it will be hard for junior me.  Never breathe a word of dyslexia or any kind of excuse.  Just some daily flash exercises for the routine stuff.  I will 100% take time off work for this if I have to, which I have the luxury of doing.\n\nThings my I would do differently than my parents:\n\n* We can skip the religion phase\n* No \"finish everything on your plate\" nonsense - full means full\n* Focus more on physical exercise, even if its something \"weird and foreign\" like martial arts\n* No shaming about sex, be willing to talk openly and provide a safe environment for questions",

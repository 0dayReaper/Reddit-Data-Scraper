It's an odorless, flavorless powder that you mix into their food; somehow it makes actual shit taste *worse* than shit, so they'll no longer be interested in the act of coprophagy. It works very well!\n\nEdit: aww guys, I'm so happy this info can help some people!  I wish I could reply to every comment, but I've just had hand surgery, so I'm clumsy &amp; sore. \n\nYes, I've used it, with great success. You don't have to do it forever, just a couple of days &amp; they get the idea. Then a pinch or two on occasion if they slip up. \n\nForbid is made with wheat gluten &amp; msg, it can be fed to dogs, cats and yes even chickens (but I've not personally tried the chicken thing).\n\nCanned pumpkin is also worth a try; it's a magic cure for both constipation *and* diarrhea in pets. I had no luck with my little one and coprophagia with pumpkin &amp; she wouldn't eat pineapple, so ....\n\nLastly, thank you for all the awards!  Omg, so nice of you!  Now I'm going to ice my hand.

He is not interested in the glass, he is interested in getting you to react. \n\nJust stop reacting, if possible not even flinching, and don't get up when they do it. Give it a few minutes of no reaction. Depending on how long they've done it it can take a while, but if you're lucky it can be done after 3-4 times. Absolutely no reaction, or opposite effect reaction if that's the case (e.g. leaving the room, or *not* doing something they want). \n\nThis works with all 'bad' cat habits. E.g. if my chonker wakes me up before his feeding time I will intentionally feed him later. He's learned that waking me up before the big sound means he's not getting food, and waking me up alongside my alarm gets him food.\n\nNever too late to train him, but it might take longer to get him to drop the habit if it's been happening for some years now. I'd spend some time to ask myself when he does the glass thing. Is it immediately, or is it when you've been neglecting him for a while? If the latter, you need to give your cat more attention. Mine would do it when he was upset about being ignored while I was at the computer, so I just pick him up and place him on my lap when I'm there.\n\nEdit: aww, thanks for the awards and comments, strangers. Us cat dads need to look out for each other &lt;3 I was actually feeling rather down about being kinda useless lately and this thread made me feel a lot better about myself, thank you! I'm not a professional and nothing is 100% sure (and there's only so much I can know about your situation from vague Reddit comments) but I'll try to share what cat training advice I know!",

There was the option of amputation and chemo and even that wouldn't guarantee any amount of time. Some dogs live years after and some just months. I decided he just wouldn't handle that very well. So I did the hardest thing I've ever done and lay beside him while he passed. I question constantly if that was the right call because I will read things saying how well dogs do with chemo and amputation but I just can't believe they don't feel awful just like people.",

We use lower doses in pets than humans would get, which is why they tend to feel better. However, osteosarcoma is a nasty cancer and, in my experience, most dogs live less than a year with amputation and chemo. I would have made the same choice you did for my pet. Also, I don\u2019t think anyone can be faulted for not pursuing chemotherapy in any situation. It\u2019s very expensive and usually not a cure. They taught us in vet school that \u201cdeath is not a harm\u201d. There are many worse things than a peaceful death and, as someone else said, better a day too soon than a day too late.",

It showed that his life wasn't so bad before he got frozen. Fry thinks he's so unimportant that he wasn't even missed back in 2000. But the episode Jurassic Bark shows us the impact of Fry's sudden disappearance.\n\nLars fucks that up. The existence of Lars directly undoes any impact to the world caused by the sudden disappearance of Fry. He didn't actually disappear, he basically just time traveled to the future and back and fit right back into his own life.",

                    "comment": "Sorry for this huge rambling reply, but your answer just made me think a lot. My cat passed away in April of this year, just past her 7th birthday. What I wouldn't give to have another 24 hours with her.\n\nWhen she passed away, I was sad, of course- I wished so much that I could've had more time with her- but it hadn't really *hit* me at the time. My mother's gotten herself a new cat since (who's adorable, but he's not *my* cat, you know?), and every time I interact with him, and see how different he is from what my cat was like, it breaks me up a little more- she was really the first cat i'd ever had, and so I'm realizing the things that weren't just 'that's her, being a cat', but were actually the wonderful parts of her personality.\n\nWhenever i was out of my bedroom, she'd *always* follow me around, always in the same room as me- she'd meow at the bathroom door for me to let her in if she wasn't already in there. It was pretty much the *only* time she made any noise; the only other time was if I made a meowing noise at her, she'd echo it, and then I'd echo, back and forth a few times. If my hands or feet were *anywhere* near her, she'd just start licking and licking until I moved away. She *hated* being picked up by my mother, but she'd let me hold her for however long I wanted. I feel so angry with myself that I didn't realize that she loved me so, so, *so* much until she was gone. I miss her so, so much.",

Whenever it is that I end up getting another cat I'd like for it to sit beside Charlie in my heart rather than try to occupy the same space...if that makes any sense.",

Id also want to know how he feels about different people hes met, different music hes heard and so on.  I would love to get to know him better, so I could make his life even more enjoyable. \n\nId  tell him that I love him, and that he needs to be a good listener. Not all of the rules are fun, but they are meant to keep him safe and healthy.",

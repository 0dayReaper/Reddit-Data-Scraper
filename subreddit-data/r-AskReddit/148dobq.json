She worked two jobs early in my life to be able to divorce my older sister\u2019s dad who was a piece of trash. \n\nShe\u2019s almost always put my sister and I\u2019s happiness before her own. \n\nI went through my shitty years during college where I barely called or talked to my mother or father\u2026 but they haven\u2019t held that against me or even ever brought it up.\n\nMy mother has always let me be my own person and maybe the one thing I respect the most is that they allowed me to fail at times, to learn some life lessons. They\u2019d try steering me in a direction on some things but most things they allowed me to go out and get the novel experience of. \n\nI talk to my mother every day, whether by text or phone call. She adores my children and still finds the time to try and do motherly things even though I\u2019m a grown ass man (she will throw in my laundry for me while she\u2019s babysitting, etc.) \n\nMy father and my mother are divorced but I talk to my father less frequently\u2026 but probably for a greater length of time each call. I value his opinions, even when they differ from mine. I also know that I can tell this man anything and he does his very best to not pass judgment on me but to give it to me straight and allow me to form my own opinions or responses. \n\nThe TLDR: you don\u2019t get to choose your parents. Some will be good parents who you have a good relationship with because they want to have a relationship with you. Others won\u2019t have a great relationship because they don\u2019t value that. Some people weren\u2019t meant to be parents. All you can do as is try and maintain that relationship through your life and hope they want to be in your life/be a parent to you, in whatever way being a \u201cparent\u201d is to them.",

But the issue is that they eventually lose connection with the kids (and sometimes the wife as well) due to long hours and exhaustion after work. \n\nAnd, because of the overwhelming focus on work, they also lose the tools they need to maintain what little connection they currently have as the kids get older. This puts them into a feedback loop where, even if they want to claw their way back later on, they can't. So instead they just put _even more_ focus on their job and work friends.\n\nI have empathy for my dad but I also view him as a cautionary tale for my own life.",

Long story short, they loved me.\n\nOne of the other reasons I've kept a good relationship with my parents is that they haven't just seen me and my siblings as a \"son\", but as a whole human being, with his own ideals, his own history and his own choices. We could share ideas and debate, and learn from each other. \n\nI think it's sometimes difficult to separate ourselves from a parent/child relationship, where parents have a kind of arbitrary truth. It's natural that when we're young, we need to be guided and reasoned with, at least in part, by the parents. But as they get older, it's good to let go of that and sometimes (often imo) listen to our child as an equal.",

It's ok to fail if you really tried your hardest, but the last thing I would ever want is for her to be disappointed in me for not doing my best. School and stuff wasn't that challenging for me and she knew that. I'd come home with a report card (all honors and AP classes) and have all A's and one B. She would not praise me for the A's, she would only comment, \"why do you have a B in english?\" (this was a real conversation).\n\nShe wasn't being mean, that was the right question. Getting an A doesn't mean you're going above and beyond, it just means you did what the teacher told you to do, period. She was right, why did I have a B in english?\n\nAnyways, that sounds like she was harsh, and she could be, but she's also the sweetest lady you've ever met and she would do literally anything for me.\n\nMy only real driving goal in life is to do things that would make my mom and sister proud of me.",

No spanking or corporal punishment in my parent's house, but it wasn't necessary either. If we were acting out, we'd be sent to our room and told to come back when we were ready, or if we were out and about, dad would bring the tantruming-child back to the car and sit with us until we settled down.  \nThat generally did the trick. We'd go up, and when we were calm again we'd come back, generally make some token grump to feel like we won, and then things were okay again.  \nThey took us places, did cool activities with us like rafting and camping.  \nIf we wanted to try something new, like rock-climbing or model-rocketry or scuba-diving, they generally moved heaven and earth to make it happen.  \n\n\nMy childhood was a whirlwind of trying all sorts of things. I was a complete noophile.  \nThat spread of skills and knowledge gives me a lot of confidence. I know there's almost nothing I can't do because I've tried so many things.  \n\n\nMy parents are loads of things to me.  \nMost of all though, I know I can rely on them to back me up, and they have done so from time to time even into my adult years.  \n\n\nThey lent me upwards of \u00a3150,000 to buy my house while I was in the process of selling my old one. That let me break the ongoing chain on the purchase.  \nLucky I did, because I think the seller was getting pretty close to backing out on the deal, and the buyer for the old place actually did back out a couple weeks later.  \nI was able to pay them back in full when the old house sold, and my parents were very patient about it.

I always knew they loved me even when they had to punish me for stupid shit I did.\n\nBut growing up I saw this as only part of the equation. I grew up in a terrible area most of my friends had parents that weren't around a ton due to having multiple jobs, so I saw this as normal and expected. As I got older, my family moved, and most of my friends became solidly middle / upper middle class I saw some terrible attitudes from my friends towards their parents.\n\nOne of my closest friends HATED his dad because he missed almost all his football games in highschool. He just couldn't understand why when his other friends parents never missed their kids games. All his friends 'supported him' and agreed how horrible his dad was and made the situation worse. Well his dad was working two jobs to make ends meet and get ahead in life, so his kids could have things he never got as a kid, you know safety and opportunity. My friend had a computer in his bedroom, got to go to summer football camp, got a beater car when he turned 16 and had his insurance paid for. Things that would have been considered extreme luxuries to a kid out of the ghetto, but because they managed to live in a nicer area he just expected he'd get these things because he saw his friends get them. When he graduated and left home he didn't talk to his dad for almost a decade until he had his own kids, and he wasn't great financially and took the same route his father did and took a 2nd job to better everyones life. He finally had his ahha moment and realized how much he had fucked up and made amends. I had other friends that never did over some pretty trivial shit that most adults would look at and go 'wtf'.\n\nA huge element in having a good relationship with your parents is also understanding why they did what they did if you perceive something as negative. Were they trying to be shitty, or were they doing the best they possibly could when they had impossible decisions to make?",

            "comment": "Both my parents beat me all the time. With anything the could reach and hit me where ever the swing landed. I was a mischievous child, mostly due to my curiosity. Sometimes I did some terrible things. I\u2019m pretty sure I was a kleptomaniac but was never diagnosed. Threats to burn my hands and hang me pretty much got me to stop. Funny how the fear of death does things. \nI don\u2019t have any resentment or begrudge them for it. They are old school. They fixed me the only way they knew how. When I was doing things right they were supportive and made sure to reinforce the behavior.\nI thank them for taking extreme measure in extreme circumstances. Thanks to that I\u2019m not a criminal, I\u2019m not in a jail cell somewhere. Most of the kids my age growing up, are now in prison or under ground. I am now a productive member of society. I work at a driving school. I have my own office and teach teens and adults how to drive. I\u2019d say they did a pretty good job, and that\u2019s how they fostered the good relationship we have now.",

Weren't afraid of admitting that they messed up and were always looking to learn more.\n\nWhen I transitioned to adulthood it went very smoothly, since my parents were already treating me as someone they enjoyed talking with and were interested in my ideas.  They still wanted to support me, but they respected me and my decisions and my right to choose how I lived.  I get along really well with my brother as well because, while we had the typical sibling rivalry as kids, we were never pitted against each other.",

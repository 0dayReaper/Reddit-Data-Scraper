Flirting is like a low-stakes trial run of seeing what it might be like to date the person. It's talking to them like they're a romantic interest without doing anything that openly confirms romantic or sexual interest. \n\nAll the actions people list when they describe \"flirting\" - laughing a lot, touching their arm, flipping your hair, teasing them, asking them to hold something for you, biting your lip - all of these are just some of many things that can happen naturally if you're talking to someone you're considering dating. There's no code or set of rules. Don't try to force any specific action; just have a fun conversation and be yourself.\n\nFlirting is discreet by nature - once you openly express interest, flirting is over and the answer you get depends on how well flirting went.",

I\u2019ve lived here a year now and I always feel like I look good in it.\n\nI think this \u201cmagic mirror\u201d thing is because we become accustomed to consistently seeing ourselves, and thus perceiving ourselves, as the image in the mirror we use almost everyday.\n\nSo when we see ourselves in a different lighting and area we feel like we look weird because we\u2019re not used to that version of us. Just try and remember that others do not view our imperfections as harshly as we do.\n\nEdit: Despite my username having the word MILF in it, I am in fact a man. So please stop asking and messaging me for pics.\n\nEdit 2: Looks like some of you still want pictures, so here you go:\n\nPic 1: https://i.imgur.com/aSVrNDp.png\n\nPic 2: https://i.imgur.com/h607DLI.jpg\n\nPic 3: https://i.imgur.com/HXeJhRJ.jpg",

I went to a museum of illusion a few months back and they had a 'magic mirror' but this mirror made you see yourself as other saw you. It essentially flipped the image and I couldn't comprehend it. I didn't recognise myself for a split second but when I did I started seeing things I'd never noticed and there was serious cognitive dissonance between my mental image of me and what I was seeing.",

Front facing cameras do the same thing. But when you see yourself in a photo, you're looking at what you look like to the rest of the world. It's not unlike hearing your voice through a recording. It doesn't sound quite right so you feel uncomfortable. When you look at a photo you look slightly different that what your used to seeing (your mirror image).",

This can actually be flattering depending on the type of face you have, partly responsible for some being photogenic.",

Then put your arms out by your sides, palms facing forward, and roll your shoulders up and back and try to find that spot where your shoulders seem to rest on your back. Let them sit in that spot and hold this position for a minute or so and take deep breaths. Your chest may feel tight when you breathe but the more you do this the better it will be. I hope this makes sense. I\u2019ve been doing this for about 30 sec to 1 minute every few hours and I\u2019ve noticed a huge improvement with my posture and neck/back pain. That neck and back pain is often from looking down at your phone or computer for long periods or just any work where you are scrunching forward. It\u2019s becoming a very common issue for many people.",

What I found effective for a quick posture fix is bending over so your fingers brush your toes and just hanging there somewhat relaxed for about 30-60 seconds, then slowly unrolling yourself up like a fern (shoulders stay forward until you\u2019re almost at the top, at which point you roll them back). Gives you better posture for a bit and also keeps some pressure off your spinal disks",

If you can work on releasing the tension in the front of the shoulders and chest you\u2019ll find it\u2019s easier to relax the shoulder blades down your back and elevate the front chest and neck into a more upright position. Look up beginner shoulder opening stretches and a few minutes a day is all it takes to make some incredible progress fairly quickly.",

Having a regular healthy diet and self care practices help, but ultimately I'd just hold onto the image of how you looked best recently and know most people don't look at you with such scrutiny as you probably do to yourself.",

I feel useless, stupid, and ugly because my brain doesn't work the way everyone else's does. sure I'm creative and make tons of artwork, but I can only focus on that and my pets. when I lived with my ex he'd say \"it's incredible how you can always remember to feed and brush and cut your dogs nails, but you literally can't remember where you put your wallet or phone charger. I don't know how you live like that\"\n\nwell, it's not a choice buddy. every comment someone makes on my poor attention span or lack of short term memory hurts so bad because I cannot control it. I have a friend who has autism and he relates to this very well. it's hard to love yourself when you look in the mirror and see failure from everyone's comments.",

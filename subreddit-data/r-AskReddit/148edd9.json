Long misspent youth, used to be friends with a guy called Simon, stayed over at his house, played sega megadrive all night (genesis), all that good stuff... One day his family moved to Canada, no not America I know but enough of a cultural shift.\n\nYears later, his family came back to visit, me and Simon went bowling, just by my normal speech and there was nothing confrontational at all, completely out of the blue he asked me if I wanted to go outside and fight...\n\nWe were all early teens by that point, after my mum and his mum talking on the phone just by the way I said things I made him feel like I was somehow better than him and he wanted to fight over it.\n\nAt the time I was confused as fuck about it (this is pre internet too BTW).\n\nI just did and said what I normally did and this dude wanted to fight over it, later in life (much later, where I am now) I get it.\n\nEdit: there's ww2 eara videos about how gi's should act in England lol... I've watched a few of those they're hilarious.",

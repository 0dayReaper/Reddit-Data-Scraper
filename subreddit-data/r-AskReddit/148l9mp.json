In their eyes, Trump proves them right. He \"proves them right\" to such an extent that he was elected president. This is something they can never forget.\n\nIf you're a Sanders supporter like me, think about how much he's done to normalize discussions of socialism and socialist policy in a country that's long been *aggressively* hostile to socialism. You've always felt like the system isn't work, that the answers are right there in front us, but were just not allowed to openly acknowledge them - until he came along. That's basically the exact same reason why Trump's base loves him.",

But so many live in deeply conservative areas that they suffer from bad policing, bad jobs, bad schools, and selfish, laissez-faire capitalist bosses. Their take home pay sucks; drugs like meth are often rampant; and local politicians know they can be corrupt and still get elected. \n\nThen there's fear brought by changes. Churches are not important anymore; homophobia is common, which is literal fear of gay people; and white males are no longer an unofficial protected class in some areas of the nation. Losing privileges feels like being attacked (even though it is not)\n\nIt's all self-inflicted, but I think that's why it's not just Trump admiration but worship. They are desperate to escape their shitty lives and want so badly to stop things changing, so they want someone strong and authoritarian to protect them. \n\nAnd if you read this as apologetics or pro-Trump, you didn't read closely enough. :) I don't care how hurt and scared they are; they are acting like assholes and traitors to this country.",

What a good idea.\" Whoever had created humanity had left in a major design flaw. It was its tendency to bend at the knees.\u201d (*Feet of Clay*)\n\nBasically, as a species^1, we tend to gravitate toward authority, because life is complex. Folks just want someone to say \u201chey, don\u2019t you worry about [immigrants/gas prices/climate change/trans folks in the library], you just go on doing your thing, and I\u2019ll take care of it all.\u201d\n\nWhat everyone wants is for their life to be easier or at least simpler. And if they believe someone can make that happen, they\u2019ll pledge fealty to that person, ignoring lies, sexual abuse, and espionage, because *at least my life is simpler.*\n\n^1 note: as a species, not as individuals",

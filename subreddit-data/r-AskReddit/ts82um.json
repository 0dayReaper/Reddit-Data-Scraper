He absolutely could have kept going about Jada for an hour if he wanted to.  But, I think the producer was right - Rock comes out of this looking like gold.  He told a joke that was maybe a little unsavory, but Willard responded *wildly* terribly and even then only AFTER he noticed she was upset, and she looked horrifically smug after Willard sat back down as opposed to, you know, any kind of shock that her husband had just slapped a man on national television for telling a joke.\n\nRock just looking shocked and then moving on was him absolutely locking down the moral high ground.  And now, because of that he gets to make absolutely any joke he wants about that tonight.  He's had 3 days to cook up material, he's bursting at the seams, and he's got a completely blank check to say whatever the hell he wants, exactly what he wanted to do immediately after it but now with the benefit of being able to revise and refine that work for 3 days.\n\nJada and Willard will be *obliterated* tonight, it's gonna be fucking great.",

That doesn't get the attention because of all the mess, but she basically was providing love and care and somehow ended up having a relationship.

Usually the Smiths things are rumors, but this one opened the flood gates. Even worse, even she choose to address it, will had to be there and he just looked embarrassed and upset, idgaf what they say about him being fine.",

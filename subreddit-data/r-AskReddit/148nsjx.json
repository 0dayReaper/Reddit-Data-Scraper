Say there's a holiday on Thursday, you can spend one day for Friday and take a nice long weekend trip somewhere. Then you spend another 10 days for a two week vacation. Then you're burned out and take another 5 days just to chill and do nothing around the house. And so on. In Poland I just found out that if you take a block of at least two weeks the company pays you extra to fund your vacation too (no idea how much).\n\n Around the end off the summer your boss starts sending reminders to use some of your time off if you haven't because if you don't use it by a certain date the company has to pay you and they don't want to. Usually it rolls a bit into the next year, I believe it's the first quarter in Spain and at least until end of February in Poland.",

Especially if it\u2019s not much. \nIn the UK I get 25 vacation days + 10 bank holidays (12 this year because the queen died and king needed to king). Then sick time and bereavement etc is totally separate and uncapped (ie they can\u2019t fire you) - though beyond I think 6 days I need a note. Then there are processes for long term sick. My employer it\u2019s full pay for ages, but some drop down to a low %. \nFor 7 years I didn\u2019t need any extra days off. Then had 3 weeks off when my mum died, then the next year I got sepsis and needed a month off. They didn\u2019t actually ask for a note for either of those. No sick or other extra days off needed this year so far thank god. My firm does pretty much unlimited unpaid leave too. Took 2 months off unpaid to travel a while back.\n\nFuck I couldn\u2019t live in the US actually. Might have lost my job when I got sepsis and would have had medical debt I guess. I was in for a while with a fuck tonne of drugs.",

Most jobs you generate hours of sick time and person time per week, hour, year so you have to work to earn them. \n\nPeople on reddit love to claim the US has bad Healthcare, it's more complicated than that. The US spends more on Healthcare per person than any other high income country. The most innovation comes from the US, capitalism creates innovation. The quality of the care in the US is incredible but the system is flawed. \n\nTo see my primary care provider it costs me 25$, to see a specialist it costs me 50$ and other things have costs it just depends. This health insurance costs me 150$ per paycheck and I think is pretty good.\n\nNo one knows everything about the system or how to fix, I definitely wouldn't trust anything anyone says on reddit of all places.",

Some areas and employers have the two separated which leads to some people having to take sick leave when healthy to maximize their tike off usage.\n \nI'm salaried, so it gets differently complicated. If salaried is something you're not familiar with, basically i get paid the same amount if i work 40, 80, or 30 hours. I am given a set amount of paid time off (PTO). If I am out of PTO, I should have to just work through it. Thankfully, my current employer actually cares about work/life balance, so they'll sometimes let me work shorter days and make the hours up later.\n \nFor example, I am relatively new and got sick, so I used up most of my limited PTO bank. Then, my mother passed away, and I needed some extra time off in addition to their bereavement leave. My manager allowed me to just log in for a couple of hours and count that. During the busy season, I worked several 12-hour days, so it evens out in the end.\n \nIn contrast, when I worked hourly and got sick, I would need to beg and plead with coworkers to get my shift covered or work sick (if I didn't come in, I could get written up or fired). On top of that, any hours I couldn't pick up through an extra shift or switching, I would not get paid for. They didn't even offer PTO at those jobs, so they were worse than what the other person described. I lived with my parents at that time and rent was, thankfully, not an issue.",

I've had several jobs, and many have set hours (usually something like 10 days vacation time and 5 sick days, though you could use vacation if you go over sick time) to use and beyond that, you would need to take unpaid leave or some kind of FMLA/disability leave. I had a few jobs like that when I was younger and lower level, and if they liked you and you didn't abuse time off, you could sometimes get an advance on vacation if you had a long vacation opportunity (like getting married or having a kid as a father).\n\nHowever, the company I work for now is really good with work/life balance. I used to get a month vacation (though I've never used all of it in a year) and 3 weeks of sick time (which is really useful as a parent because I have to take off sick for my kids way more than for myself), but they just changed it to basically unlimited time off. We'll see how that goes in practice, but in theory, it works pretty well. I've had some colleagues take off a bunch of time for Paternity Leave or mental health, etc. and we all just covered their work until they got back and it was fine. However, I think this is exceedingly uncommon outside of the FAANG/Big Tech space.",

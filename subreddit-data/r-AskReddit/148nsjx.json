My employer it\u2019s full pay for ages, but some drop down to a low %. \nFor 7 years I didn\u2019t need any extra days off. Then had 3 weeks off when my mum died, then the next year I got sepsis and needed a month off. They didn\u2019t actually ask for a note for either of those. No sick or other extra days off needed this year so far thank god. My firm does pretty much unlimited unpaid leave too. Took 2 months off unpaid to travel a while back.\n\nFuck I couldn\u2019t live in the US actually. Might have lost my job when I got sepsis and would have had medical debt I guess.

The statistics basically add up that most people end up taking less because they feel like they're not losing anything. Additionally, the company never has to pay out accrued vacation. However, if you're a smart employee and have a good reputation at your office, you can do some pretty awesome things with unlimited PTO. I had a friend who didn't work a friday in 2 years. It was only when his boss needed him for a customer emergency that it was pointed out he hadn't worked fridays since pre COVID.",

I've had several jobs, and many have set hours (usually something like 10 days vacation time and 5 sick days, though you could use vacation if you go over sick time) to use and beyond that, you would need to take unpaid leave or some kind of FMLA/disability leave. I had a few jobs like that when I was younger and lower level, and if they liked you and you didn't abuse time off, you could sometimes get an advance on vacation if you had a long vacation opportunity (like getting married or having a kid as a father).\n\nHowever, the company I work for now is really good with work/life balance. I used to get a month vacation (though I've never used all of it in a year) and 3 weeks of sick time (which is really useful as a parent because I have to take off sick for my kids way more than for myself), but they just changed it to basically unlimited time off. We'll see how that goes in practice, but in theory, it works pretty well. I've had some colleagues take off a bunch of time for Paternity Leave or mental health, etc. and we all just covered their work until they got back and it was fine.

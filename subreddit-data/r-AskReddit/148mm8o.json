            "comment": "In college I had a roommate that had OCD. One day he really made me mad, crossed a line. And I wanted to get back at him. At this time, he started like a 10,000 piece in the living room. I heard him on the phone to his mom previously talk about the puzzle and how he liked it because it gave him a sense of purpose and the feeling of accomplishment he will feel after completing this task will be incredible. The next day, I was a little lost in the sauce after a night at the bars. I saw the puzzle, and took one of the pieces that have not been put in and threw it off the balcony. I then went to sleep. About 3 months later, he was about to finish the puzzle and I hear a shriek from the living room. I go in, he's cursing, screaming, tearing apart the apartment looking for the piece because it was the only piece he was missing. The perfect revenge",

            "comment": "I was on long Sunday drive with my girlfriend, her daughter, my son, and my dog. Now, my Catahoula is a good boy most of the time, but let me tell you, when he farts, it's like a chemical war has broken out.\n\nSo, we're all driving along, minding our own business, when suddenly I let out this silent but massive fart. And when I say massive, I mean it was \"clear the room\" bad. I could see my girlfriend and her daughter wrinkling their noses in disgust, and my son looked like he was about to pass out.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"Why blame the poor dog?\" But trust me, when this little guy farts, it's like he's been eating nothing but beans and broccoli for a week straight. It's like he's got a personal vendetta against our noses.\n\nSo, I did what any sane person would do and blamed it on the dog. I mean, he's a good boy and all, but he's got some serious gas issues. And let's be real, it's not like he can defend himself against my accusations. He just sat there, looking up at me with those big, innocent eyes, like he had no idea what I was talking about.\n\nLooking back, I do feel a little bad about it. I mean, the poor guy didn't deserve to take the fall for my fart. But at least we were in the car and not some crowded elevator or something. Can you imagine the looks we would have gotten?",

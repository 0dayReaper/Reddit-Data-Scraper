Then upon waking when you feel that big morning fart gearing up to make an exit (I always wake up and immediately blast off a few farts- is this a typical thing? Anyhow) and all that fart needs it a *liiittttle* push to greet the day, when you flex those abdominals to evacuate said gas you know what else gets evacuated from the push- that\u2019s right. All of the jelly jam that\u2019s been hanging out loose in your uterus and lady tunnels for the last few hours. *SQUELCH* Hope that pad\u2019s pretty sturdy.",

In that dream I started dating this girl, finished my degree, and moved across the country. We had an apartment, I had a well paying job, and things were going really well. Then I woke up and was upset about it for like a week. The most frustrating part for me was I was indeed not done with math classes.\n\nI still remember exactly what that girl looks like and one day I saw someone that looked nearly identical. I don't believe in any higher meaning or anything, but it was definitely a mind fuck.\n\nEdit: For those who asked and want to know, no I didn't talk to her. \"Hey I saw you in a dream where we dated for two years\" isn't the greatest pickup line.",

Coma dude was literally out for mere minutes (came to on the ground before getting to the hospital) and had the same issue with disassociated memories. I'm sure going into the game, you weren't expecting to come out of it jaded.\n\nEdit: Yes, I was speaking directly about the guy in the coma who dreamed up a whole life and when he came to had depression issues similar to the death of a loved one.  If we are to assume the VR simulation is one we are unaware of until we stop playing, I think it could be disastrous on the mind (assuming it works as is currently - which could be a symptom of the simulation but lets try not to go that deep).  I think in a virtual environment like this, you need to retain memories from outside of the game.  Otherwise I believe that once you get out, it would be hard to determine if you are still in a virtual world or a \"real\" one.",

Our concept of the self and time is a product of the way our brains are organized: in reality, it seems that time isn't linear, and that the Universe is singular. There exists only one thing: Everything. I think that when we \"die\", we don't stop existing per say: we just forget how to be *ourselves* and return to our natural state of being *everything*. You are the Universe and the Universe is you and all that. So, in a way, death isn't final or sad: it's an escape from the limitations of this particular organization of matter. Once this specific organization breaks down, we don't cease to exist, just our sense of self ceases to exist and we become one with the cosmos again.",

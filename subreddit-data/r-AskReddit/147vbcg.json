I'm sound engineer by trade and i concur, the frequencies that should alert other road users are directed backwards, and low frequencies that travel more like originating from a point source will be masked by the tremendous amounts of low frequencies even in the quietest cars. And the more quiet the car is, the more insulation from the external world it has. The sound levels in that exhaust pipe has to be tremendous to break thru modern car sound isolation. Modern houses on the other hand are still vulnerable as they are not built to combat such high levels of noise. It becomes very expensive, very fast to do sound isolation in large scale. The costs would exceed the regular building costs by multiples or even magnitude of order.  A small box is not that difficult to isolate, specially when it is fairly well isolated even before we think about sound.\n\nTo have the most effect, the tail pipes should point to the sides. \n\nRear ending also happens when you are at a stand still and idling, and then your engine noise is at its lowest..",

There are no studies that show it actually work, but there are plenty that say that making yourself more visible does help.

A lot of guys will say \u201cloud pipes save lives\u201d, which I find to be nonsense because I\u2019ve had a couple of occasions of bikes blowing by me and being startled by the noise, but by that point it was already either at my driver window or ahead of me. It also completely ignores the science behind how sound waves work and the doppler effect works. \n\nJust admit that you want a loud bike because it turns heads. I\u2019m a motorcycle rider myself and it\u2019s nice when people acknowledge and compliment your bike. And mine isn\u2019t even loud as far as motorcycles go. So having a loud sound that draws even more attention your way seems reasonable. Being loud to make yourself known on the road a bad excuse, coming from a fellow bike rider",

But maybe he should have taken that as a lesson to not be driving his truck at 5am in a residential area? It wasn't always parked there so I assume he must have drove his car to wherever the truck was supposed to be parked and then got in the truck some days? Maybe it was just easier to leave from home?",

The drivers shit on stanced ricers while they make every effort to sound almost exactly the same.  Couple extra horsepower, maybe, for no useful reason and a lot of decibels. \n\nModern muscle cars with modded exhausts don\u2019t sound much better. \n\nIt\u2019s become such a generic sound.

            "comment": "I bought my car with the exhaust setup it has. I love the sound. Aftermarket headers, hi-flow cats and other exhaust compents increase performance as well as make the car louder. Some do it for attention but most the people I know who have loud cars do it for themselves. I do it for me and the people who like it. If you don't like it, then I'm not doing it for you.\nI love doing 2-3 gear pulls when no one else is around. Even better when I'm around trees\n\nAbout the people I'm disturbing, I don't get loud in my neighborhood. Especially not at night or in the early morning. If you're in another neighborhood I happen to be downshifting or accelerating by, I'm sorry. I stay quiet around pedestrian, especially women and dogs, might get loud around dudes. I live in a city with a lot of car people and most of us love hearing a good exhaust setup. \n\nTl;DR: Love the sound, love the performance boost and yes I think people in houses",

Cool, you have a loud and fast car, go on a freeway or track or some shit, no one wants to hear your shit. \n\nSo, I appreciate you being aware and not a dick with being loud just to be loud.",

Fast cars are generally loud cars. It comes with the territory. If you are an enthusiast of cars you will appreciate all of the different sounds these vehicles makes. Big surprise to learn that we actually like loud cars, to a point obviously. \n\nIts no different than someone liking ear-piercing rock metal music or in OPs case, Enya.",

Pretty sure OP would count that in the \"loud vehicles\" category. It's just having common courtesy.\n\nIt's like when I let my dog outside to go to the bathroom and he starts barking, I bring him inside because other people don't need to or want to listen to him, common courtesy and awareness of your environment.",

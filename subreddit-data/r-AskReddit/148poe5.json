Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ.\n\nAnd his other closest disciple Peter wrote the following:\n\n\"For we did not follow cleverly contrived myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; instead, we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.  For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying \u201cThis is my beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased!\u201d We ourselves heard this voice when it came from heaven while we were with him on the holy mountain.\"\n\nThese are the words of two men who knew Jesus the closest and were confident that Jesus was who He said He was - namely the Son of God. They went from being lowly fisherman to preaching Jesus around the known world though it meant imprisonment, torture, exile.and death. Heed their words and you too can know the peace that brings a confidence that even the risk of death will not break.\n\nTo learn more, check out https://www.voiceofprophecy.com/bible-studies",

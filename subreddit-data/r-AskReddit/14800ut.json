You usually take it through an oil that you hold under your tongue and then swallow, though there are now edible treats, beverages, capsules, and body creams in addition to the classic flower, which would be smoked. \n\nI find CBD helpful if I'm really anxious, because I start noticing my body is relaxing and it helps slow down the cycle in my mind. When I'm anxious, I notice that my heart is racing and my shoulders are tight, and it's hard to relax them and wait my hands are clenched too and shit, I'm supposed to be trying to relax and now I'm stressed about my body, yada yada yada****\n\nPersonally, it's hard to be less anxious about *anything* when my body is doubling and tripling down on the anxiety itself. CBD helps me break that cycle, and the physical relief goes a long way for me.",

I quit drinking a year and a half ago and haven\u2019t had any of those anxiety related issues since, and it has really done a lot for my mental wellbeing. I\u2019m not in a perfect mental state, but I\u2019ve got a much better handle on myself than I did. Small amounts of alcohol stimulates GABA receptors in your brain which can reduce anxiety, but if you drink regularly your brain receptors adapt, reducing and depleting GABA, which can increase anxiety, tension, and panic. It\u2019s just one of those things that could potentially be doing you more harm than good, even if you still associate it with anxiety management, because it once did something positive for you, however fleeting. I know not everyone is in the place mentally to just stop drinking, it\u2019s definitely one of those things I never saw myself actually quitting, but I did, once I realized it wasn\u2019t really working for me, but against me in every respect. I don\u2019t really think about drinking anymore, it\u2019s not something I feel like I\u2019ve given up, I\u2019m not depriving myself of anything, quite the opposite. It\u2019s all about your perspective, but I have no doubt that it\u2019s doing you more harm than good when it comes to your health, mental or otherwise. Maybe you already know all this, but maybe this will help you or someone else having the same issues. Best of luck to you.",

Honestly it all depends on how heavily you drink, some people need to seek medical help in order to stop in a safe way. I\u2019m not making any assumptions or judgements on how much you drink, just a consideration to keep in mind if you think that applies to you. It gets worse before it gets better, probably be more cranky/moody for a couple weeks, and might have trouble sleeping. Generally it takes 3 - 6 weeks for your mood to get better. Honestly with the whole sober for a month thing you might be limiting yourself as far as the benefits if you stick strictly to it and start back up again after the month. The longer you go the better, but any amount of time is definitely an achievement, don\u2019t get me wrong. Your sleep quality will get better if you stop, and you won\u2019t miss feeling tired/hungover from drinking the night before, that\u2019s for sure. If you Google benefits of drinking over time you\u2019ll get more details, but here\u2019s one of the results:\n\n\u201ct may take a full month of not drinking alcohol to feel better. Although positive changes may appear earlier, 3 months of not drinking can not only improve your mood, energy, sleep, weight, skin health, immune health, and heart health. It can even reduce your risk of cancer.\u201d\n\nIf I were you I\u2019d set a goal for at least the month, but keep it more open-ended if possible. Glad you\u2019re up for giving it a shot, you\u2019ll probably save a little bit of money too.",

                    "comment": "Hey man. I've been living with anxiety for longer than you've been alive (in my late 30s now) so I hope some of what I have to say is helpful.\n\nAnxiety disorders are really tough, terrible stuff. Mine started when I was a little older than you are now, and it's never really gone away. However, I've done enough work over the years that mostly it is better, and sometimes it's even a lot better! Even when it's bad, I am able to function normally.\n\nThis may not help you, but some of the work I have found most promising was working through realizing that the anxiety is a protective mechanism. Fear in itself is not evil - my inability to control and accept it is what is causing my problem. My body thinks I am in danger, and it does exactly the job I would want of it if I was in danger - it engages my sympathetic nervous system, which generates stress and adrenaline. What I needed to do is bridge the gap to the next step that the body will take, which is engaging the parasympathetic nervous system, which calms you down.\n\nStep 1 for me was exposure therapy. I've gone through anxiety so often now that I know exactly what it's like, and yet I am still deeply anxious every time. What I needed to do was mentally grade how anxious I was (on a scale of 1-10) and accept sitting at some lower levels of anxiety (2-5) for a bit. No distractions, nothing but deep breathing and letting my body work through it directly. 15 minutes at a time, maybe, very VERY slowly.\n\nStep 2 was a form of bilateral stimulation called resource tapping. It's very simple - when my anxiety begins to climb, I put my hands across my chest and tap once on my right shoulder, and a second later on my left shoulder. I breathe slowly (7 in, 8 out) and just keep tapping for at least a few full minutes. This feels weird, but it engages the brain to access the parasympathetic nervous system I mentioned before, and brings you out of your thoughts and back down to earth as you calm down.\n\nI do want to say - neither of these techniques is magic. They required work, both of them. But I ldo feel much better, and they are simple things which worked for me (even if they were unpleasant at first). My real failure was taking nearly 15 years to get real help.\n\nMaybe speak to your therapist about these options. No one knows your issues better than they do. If they are not open to them, perhaps consider a different therapist if you can, or look up a little bit more about these techniques on your own - there is no barrier to entry and there is no harm to you in implementing them.\n\nFinally, just remember that there is no shame in failure. People fail a lot more than they succeed, but the only real failure is in giving up. The processes that you are going through are a natural, normal part of your body's system which have been slightly disregulated. Your body also has the mechanisms to take back control, but they are a little harder to learn how to use and they don't kick on immediately. If you need medication for a bit, don't hate on yourself. That's just that part of your journey. Don't give up on yourself.",

I wanna be the best version of myself for my wife and daughters but lately that just hasn\u2019t been happening. Feel like I should probably talk to someone since I hear talking it out helps. Just odd to vent to a stranger but I get it thats what theyre there for. Also havent gone because im sure some therapists just wait out the time and dont really care",

Whenever I get very very nervous (which kind of happens at random) I get myself angry on the spot. \n\nI can switch from any emotion to angry in an instant, as soon as I do that I stop the spontaneous anger (As I can easily control my anger) and by then both of the nervousness and anger subside quite instantly. I don't even know why it works but it just does. Getting angry (like not even thinking of something that pisses me of) on the spot has helped reduced any nervousness and anxiety attacks I get.\n\n It's not healthy but it's my coping mechanism and since I can control my anger very well (I had a helicopter mother) it helps me become more social.\n\nYou're welcome to try it but it's not healthy I'd say nor do I even understand why it works.",

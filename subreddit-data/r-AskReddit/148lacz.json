One day before the date, she insisted we should meet at the uni, which was a bit strange for me, but didn't really care about it at first. And then when we met and sat down, she pulled out her laptop and asked me to check her 10 page essay which was written in my language (central european). So I sat there for a fkin 40 minutes, trying to correct the mistakes she made in an essay, which wasn't even for a class that we took together,  so I had zero clue about the topic too. And then happened the funniest thing: after I was done with the essay, she insisted, that I should send her all the homeworks I made for the classes we have taken together.\nI smiled, said goodbye, then blocked her.\ud83d\ude04",

Making sure I was at least trying to go to bed early, getting some sort of exercise (even just a walk) daily, and avoiding junk food helped me feel better about myself overall.\n\nI started managing my work/life balance a bit better, ensuring I had more time for the above.\n\nI also started seeing a doctor and a psychologist. I\u2019m on medication for the depression but also regularly going for therapy.  It\u2019s a multifaceted approach because I can\u2019t just rely on one thing working; I need to have multiple supports so that if one fails, I can still lean on the others.\n\nUnder the assumption you\u2019re making this post for yourself, I hope this helps and I hope you get the help you need!",

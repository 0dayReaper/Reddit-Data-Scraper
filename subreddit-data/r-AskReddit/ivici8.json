But this time, if they wait they might get a democrat.  Such an asshole. \n\nNo, mcconnell, we all see you for what you are. A sleazy, slimey, hypocritical worm.

They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert.

Cotton also wrote an op-ed for using military force against protesters.\n\nMy point is that with a 6-3 conservative majority in the Supreme Court, it is very likely a variety of laws regarding reproductive rights, LGBT protections, environmental regulation, immigration, healthcare, etc., will be stifled or outright overturned with another Trump justice on the Court. This is why so many Americans are reasonably scared.",

This was based on the 14th Amendment's right to privacy and personal liberty as well as the 9th Amendment's assertion that people have rights even if they are not explicitly enumerated by the Constitution. This meant that states could not make a blanket law that bans all abortion in all circumstances.\n\nSo, a lot of legislators worked to get around this. They started making a lot of laws that didn't ban abortion but made it very difficult to get one. For example, if you wanted to get an abortion in Pennsylvania in 1982, you would have to bring a piece of paper showing that you had notified your husband you were doing so. What Planned Parenthood vs. Casey did was say that you cannot create \"an undue burden\" that prevents someone from exercising their right to an abortion. If it gets overturned, then even if Roe vs. Wade remains intact, people can write laws that while they don't ban abortion, they could put so many rules around abortion that it makes it logistically infeasible for anyone to get one.",

                    "comment": "Man Reddit is the wrong place to ask this question but I'll try to give you as accurate of a response as I can.\n\n**Mechanics of the Court**\n\nThere are nine seats on the US Supreme Court and all appointments are for life.  This structure is explicitly intended to limit political influence on the court.\n\nNow that RBG as passed a new justice will be appointed.  President Trump has already released a '[shortlist](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/additions-president-donald-j-trumps-supreme-court-list/)' of justices he'll consider for the position.  \n\nBetting markets favor [Amy Coney Barrett](https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/4930/Who-will-be-Trump's-next-Supreme-Court-nominee) to be the likely successor.\n\nThe role of the US Supreme Court is first and foremost to ensure federal law is enforced consistently across all US states.  They also mediate disputes between the three branches and levels government; for example, if the legislative and the executive branches disagree about an issue or if the states and the federal government disagree.  This includes cases where federal law and state law disagree or seemingly disagree.  Finally, they are the final court of appeal for contentious issues where federal law may be unclear.\n\n**Judicial Philosophies**\n\nDifferent justices have different judicial philosophies on how they interpret the law.  Some justices believe in following the literal word of the law with a 'strict' or 'narrow' interpretation.  Essentially they read the law and any supporting documentation, try to figure out what it says, and then listen to the issue at hand and try to apply the law, as they understand it, to the matter at hand.\n\nOther justices believe in following the 'spirit' of the law, not the actual words.  They read the law as well but try to get a sense of what the law is trying to accomplish, even if that's different from what it literally says.  They hear the case at hand and also try to apply the law as they understand it but through the lens of the law's intent and not the law's wording.\n\nJudges can also vary on what they see the role of the court being.  Some judges believe that the court is simply there to interpret the law, they can't make policies - that's the role of the legislature.  This is a policy known as judicial restraint.  Other judges believe that the court should strike down bad laws.  The ones who strike down what they see as bad laws typically reason that citizens have 'implied' rights that are not explicitly stated, such as a right to privacy (not explicitly guaranteed by the constitution but arguably in line with the founders' intent).  This is a policy known as judicial activism.\n\nA third axis is 'originalism' vs 'living' law.  Those who believe in living law think that language and concepts in law should evolve as society evolves. Thus, terms such as \"cruel and unusual punishment,\" \"due process,\" or \"reasonable search and seizure\" should _not_ be interpreted based on how the individuals who wrote them or first applied them believed (as originalism states) but instead as how a member of modern society would interpret them.\n\nSupreme court justices fall at different places on these three spectrums and looking at judges as either \"liberal\"/\"conservative\" or \"democratic\"/\"republican\" misses the point.  You want to look at their beliefs in three-dimensional space.\n\n**The Philosophy of the Departed Justice**\n\nRBG believed in a 'loose' interpretation of the law: following its spirit, not its words.  She believed in living law: interpreting law through the lens of modern society and not as the people who wrote the law intended it.  Finally, she was an activist judge who believed the court should strike down laws they felt were immoral or incorrect.\n\n**What Will Change?**\n\nBecause RBG was so far to the side on all the spectrums, it's likely any replacement will move to the center in regards to judicial philosophy.  The biggest change will likely be that any judge appointed by the president will likely follow a 'strict' view of the law: ruling in favor of how that law is literally written, not with the spirit of the law.\n\nThe biggest impact for Americans will likely be how the court views an individual's right to privacy.  As noted above there is no explicit guarantee of privacy in the US Constitution, so someone with a strict view of that document will rule that, for instance, the government monitoring a citizen's internet traffic, is legal unless Congress passes a law saying otherwise.\n\n**What Will Not Change**\n\nPretty much everything you're seeing in the Reddit comments:\n\nRoe v. Wade (abortion) will not be overturned - it's a matter of settled law and no one on the court wants to change that.\n\nObergefell v. Hodges (gay marriage) will not be overturned - also a matter of settled law that no one on the court wants to touch.\n\nThe biggest problem that informed people on the left will have, whether they say it directly or not, is the fact that things _won't_ change.  They want the court to rule that gun ownership should be restricted, they want to expand the regulatory power of the federal government, they want to use the court to push through new policies, etc.\n\nWith the new justice, this type of judicial activism will likely not be possible.",

During the days between the new year and Yom Kippur, Jews pray for atonement and pledge to do better in the following year, and on Yom Kippur God enters the names of those who have truly atoned in the  book, and seals it for a year. Those whose names are sealed will live for at least another year. So for someone to die on the very last day of the year means that God judged that person very highly. It\u2019s an old story/tradition from the Middle Ages and I doubt anyone literally believes this now, but it seems like the perfect ending to her life.",

Some of y\u2019all pointed out that there are some cases where partisan politics plays a role. sure, There are a few. but most of the cases actually have either some real disagreement about the nature of the law, which 90% of the time is about some archaic legal concept most people don\u2019t understand (i.e. they had one this summer on whether website names can be trademarked) or its just a unanimous decision.\n\nEdit two: the last edit was edited for subject/pronoun agreement",

These are extremely intelligent people, appointed for life. They don't have to be worried that someone will fire them if they don't vote the \"right\" way. Read the actual cases and you will see well constructed, well thought out arguments.\n\nThe supremes are the best of what politics should be. People with admiration and respect for each other that can also disagree....not just oh you're this party so fuck you. Not to mention a willingness to cross the supposed party line of any individual believes in whatever the issue is. They have nothing to lose by doing so. \n\nScalia and RBG were opposites in their political views and were great friends. It can be done. Don't believe all the divisive bullshit, it's not that hard to respect the opinions of others and also fight for whatever you believe in.",

There's no reason to fight her spirit now too.\n\nNo matter which party you support you can admire her spirit to show up and deliver sound judgments.

Every Republican senator (who were elected by conservatives across the country) voted to have him continue as the Senate majority leader. \n\nThe GOP senate actively chooses to have someone like McConnell at the helm, so that even if Kentucky votes him out, they'll find someone to take his place and do the dirty deeds he's currently doing, as long as they keep the senate. They love that we scapegoat McConnell alone.\n\nMitch is a figurehead that represents the entirety of the GOP. Most conservative voters will happily re-elect their GOP senator who is crucial in ensuring McConnell can keep doing what he's doing.",

RBG was one of, if not the, most liberal justices, and Trump is most likely going to remove her with a far-right justice. So in all likelihood the court will end up often going 6-3 conservative, occasionally 5-4. Roberts's one swing vote will no longer be enough to change the outcome of a decision, and it'll require a second conservative justice to break party lines, which is asking a lot of our current political climate, with how divisive it is.",

They for instance allowed gay marriage and abortion for the whole of the US when those respective cases were brought before them while individual states were still banning them, among others. They are supposed to be impartial and cannot be removed from office. They do not get re-elected and serve till death (or maybe retirement), so they are save from whoever is in charge right now and their influence.\n\n\nHowever, they are still chosen by the people in charge, so there is a bias towards that party. At the end of the Obama president another court justice died and needed to be replaced. Obama put forth his candidate, but this was blocked by the Republican party. Not entirely sure, you need to check this, but I believe it is the Senate that votes on the candidate and at the time the Republicans did everything to stop this candidate to be elected, so that if a Republican got elected during the 2016 elections they could elect a judge they prefer. Well, obviously that happened.\n\n\nSo, now a new judge died, which means there is an open vacacancy that needs to be filled. However, it is very likely that Republicans, despite the election being so close - I believe closer than to Obama's end of term -, will put their candidate through. This would mean that the highest court in the US will be mostly Republican and/or conservative leaning, which will have repurcussions for years to come.",

She had such an incredible career, which is saying so much more considering her time. She talked often about being the only female in law school courses. She balanced an incredible career while also giving birth to and raising two kids. Those things were virtually unheard of in her day.\n\nAs an attorney, I\u2019ve read quite a few of Ginsburg\u2019s words over the years. I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of much of her legal reasoning, but I very much appreciated the role she played in the court. I sort of felt that she played to polar-opposites to Scalia and Thomas, and that all three of them would regularly make up legal reasoning to get where they wanted to be politically. She was absolutely necessary in her extreme opposition, especially the past few years. It\u2019ll be sad to see her seat likely filled with someone from the opposite extreme. \n\nI wish our court hadn\u2019t become a political playground of presidents. In my utopian world, we\u2019d figure out a way for justices to be moderate or regularly replaced. Then again, that\u2019s a massive pipe dream.",

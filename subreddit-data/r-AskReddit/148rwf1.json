You can use filters to improve it, but that doesn't make it great.  \n\nMeanwhile our bottled mineral spring water *is* great. Not some groundwater or aquifer crap, but mineral water from mountain springs, both still and sparkling. Our sparkling Borsec is more naturally carbonated than Coke.  \n\nThe bottled water just tastes better. So much so that people develop strong preferences over different mineral water that all comes from the mountains. Some of us get that specific, and it only happens because our water is that good.",

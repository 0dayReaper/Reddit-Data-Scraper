Massage pillows (with face hole) exist for this.\n- Rub oil into back. \n- DON'T push too hard around the spine. (Actually probably just avoid the spine entirely unless you know what you're doing - there's too many nerves there that can be A Problem)\n- Rub gently - thing 'caress' more than 'pummel'\n- You might find there's places where a more active 'massage' helps you might for example, feel 'knots' in muscles that benefit from pushing harder and making circular motions with thumbs, but don't try and be a sports therapist if you're trying to get her 'in the mood'.",

I hate admitting how long it took me to realize this, but learn from my mistakes. I wasn't checking in that my husband was washing his hands before going down there and I kept coming up with UTI's and other itchy yeast problems. Turns out he hadn't really washed his hands before play and it kept causing me issues. Once I figured out the problem (after he finished prepping and making fucking HOT SAUCE) it occurred to me that he wasn't washing his hands thoroughly after cooking and before sexy time.\n\nTo be fair, he's not a dirty person, he bathes regularly, etc. So it never occurred to him either. But if you're grabbing door handles and going for the lady bits, welp, you just introduced door handle bacteria to a self-regulating biome where it can grow and fester.\n\nSince he started washing his hands thoroughly before bed play, I haven't had an issue since.",

Min, unfortunately, is due to past trauma. You may want to consider that from your wife\u2019s perspective.\n\nAnywho, on to my advice. Sometimes I get turned off when it\u2019s too obvious my husband \u201cwants it\u201d. It is NOT because I don\u2019t want him to come on \u201ctoo strong\u201d and I want him to be distant. It\u2019s because what he thinks is \u201ccoming on strongly\u201d is actually mildly creepy feeling. Sometimes, when men are horny, things become 100% about their dick. My husband is really funny, but suddenly all jokes become sex/dick jokes, all references are sex related, his cute lovey texts turn into eggplant emojis. It\u2019s a super turn off. Men are usually physical, direct beings when it comes to expressions of romance. Women usually require something more emotionally driven.\n\nFrom my view, if you are being sweet on her and then pull away, rather than thinking you\u2019re being hard to get,  she\u2019s probably thinking \u201cwow, he\u2019s being really sweet and he\u2019s not even trying to get sex out of it.\u201d When I talked to my husband about how uncomfortable the \u201ccreepy\u201d advances were making me, how I felt like his objective was all about him having sex and not really considerate of me outside of something to have sex with, a lightbulb clicked somewhere and we\u2019ve been having more sex now then when we were dating! He takes the time to make me feel comfortable, loved, sexy\u2026. Without the pressure of it always having to be sex.\n\nI am sure you are kind to your wife. But, take the time to be sweet on your wife CONSISTENTLY, even when sex isn\u2019t on the table. Don\u2019t make it sexual when you try to be sweet, either. I hope this makes sense.\n\nI accidentally deleted my comment earlier. I\u2019m bad at Reddit.",

But like I have with many \u201cbad\u201d people, I saw a bit of hope in his words and a glimmer of potential genius in him.  \n\nJust turned out that his genius was a marketing con (which is genius in itself but that\u2019s another story) and while I think he had a decent beginning as President, he confirmed he was a shit person, even during is decent period in his Presidency and really took a nose dive with COVID.  \n\nI think voting for him was a valid gamble, but we put our chips on red and it turns out we lost that bet.",

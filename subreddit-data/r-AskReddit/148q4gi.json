I don\u2019t agree with everything Trump said or did, but he was different and I saw him as a better shot than Hillary, who was a lying sack of shit and was the same old Washington politician. \n\nPeople don\u2019t have to 100% agree with a candidate.

Pure, unintelligent bully... The question was, and I'm paraphrasing, \"There are a lot of Americans in fear at home right now, unable to leave their homes, families, children, watching this broadcast. What would you like to say to them?\" Trumps face got red, then Trump said (again, paraphrasing), \" What a horrible question, you're a bad, bad reporter. What a terrible question, etc, etc...\"  I was just like, Fuck, this guy's our President?\"",

I'd think progress would have more opportunities, not less, and certainly not because any given person can claim an adjective, we need to make more opportunities for everyone's advancement, of course people will take advantage of any system, it's why we have hackers/scammers/etc. Conservatism can help recognize where something is \"excessive\". Liberalism shows where improvement can maybe happen. Takes 2 to tango. All sides get input. I don't know what the final result will be. I'm not that smart.",

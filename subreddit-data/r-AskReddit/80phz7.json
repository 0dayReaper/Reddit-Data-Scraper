SO many possibilities in the medical field from 'curing' aging to stopping the appearance of diseases like Alzheimer's and even Cancer!\n\nScientists are already breeding mosquitoes that can't transmit malaria and ~~releasing them into the wild to spread their genes~~. It is a huge step forward in stopping one of the most deadly diseases in human history. \n\nEDIT: I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve actually released any mosquitoes into the wild yet. More likely into small controlled populations of non engineered mosquitoes to test the spread of the resistance throughout the population. ",

I talked to him about his life and past for a bit and then told him about my therapy session from the day before.  I told him that morning had officially never happened and that he could come back tomorrow or later if he needed time and get back to his job.  We talked about suicide and having already decided not to. We talked about trying not to spiral down into a pit just because you fucked up. He left a little before lunch. I told his crew of techs who saw him that he had a bad day and that we should all remember our own bad days. They supported him beautifully and he\u2019s been kicking ass ever since and prospering for it.\n\nI\u2019ve fallen into a pit of my own now.  That job is a big part of what got me here.

Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you, that meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn\u2019t. Because they were holding on to something...That there\u2019s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it\u2019s worth fighting for.\"",

Perhaps because I am afraid, and he gives me courage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, \u2018Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.  To this day, especially in times of \u2018disaster,\u2019 I remember my mother\u2019s words and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers \u2014 so many caring people in this world.\u201d",

People are installing their panels en-masse with zero subsidies. Businesses big and small, covering their roofs. It is so crazy, there may be a glut of power in SA (when the sun shines, at least)(edit: SA=South Australia, thx /u/Royalhghnss), in as few as 5 years time, considering the rate of growth.\n\nOn one sunday, a few months ago, &gt;50% of all power in SA was generated by rooftop solar alone: That's not even including wind and other large-scale renewables (we dont have hydro in SA).\n\nThe magic of all this is that it only took a few years of government investment. The market has ramped up, partly in thanks to those subsidies, we are reaping benefits, and we will be for years to come.",

For example, I can\u2019t count the number of times someone has said \u2018I\u2019ve lost faith in humanity\u2019 after watching something like black mirror, but we really don\u2019t realize that we are probably living in the best time and that humanity as a whole is improving. We are not getting worse, and stats like these strongly suggest that. The best is yet to come, and we will get there.\n\nEdit: to all those who think I\u2019m shitting on black mirror: I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s a bad show. I think it serves as a good warning and food for thought (spawning critical thought and such), but I do think many people also get a wrong message from it. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the shows fault though. I was just using it as an example.\n\nThx u/the_popcorn_pisser for pointing that idea out\n\nEdit2: some people are pointing out (rightfully) that blind optimism and blind cynicism are both bad. I agree, and this post I made isn\u2019t an attempt to be complacent. We still have a ways to go, I\u2019m just trying to call out blind cynicism.\n\nThx u/RedHerringDetected and u/DiscontentAnon for pointing this out",

The next step will be space tourism, but that won't be accessible to the average person for a few decades at least.\n\n* Space Construction - We've already done this with space stations, but cheaper commercial spaceflight will encourage larger buildings in space. Instead of launching completed modules like we have in the past, we're going to be launching subdivisions of modules that will dwarf even the ISS. I'm incredibly optimistic about whatever happens to be the \"next ISS\".\n\n* Asteroid Mining - This one we probably won't see in our lifetimes, (unless the futurists are right, and the first person to live to 200 is alive today). However, the potential of asteroid mining is astronomical! There are individual asteroids with more platinum and tungsten on them than the entire Earth has available. Once we have these materials in excess, who knows what new developments we'll see. Aluminum used to be exceedingly difficult to refine and rare. Once a reliable refining process was developed, we found a myriad of uses for aluminum that changed the world. I predict we'll see similar benefits from improved access to rare metals found abundantly in asteroids.\n\n* Space tourism - Now that we've got commercial spaceflight, and space construction is on the horizon, space tourism will become a booming industry. I'd be excited to spend a week on a luxury space station in the future. \n\n* Mars - We're definitely going at some point, whether it is publicly or privately funded. I doubt there are any monsters there, or that we'll have any visitors forced to grow potatoes with their excrement. However, Mars is the next logical destination for humanity's domination of the solar system. I hope I live to see the first colonization effort!",

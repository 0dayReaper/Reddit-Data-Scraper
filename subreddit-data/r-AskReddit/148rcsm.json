My uncle was screaming at someone on the phone, basically bitching about not being the center of attention at his father's funeral. \n\nThe last he screamed into the phone was \"I'm a part of this family too!\" which just tickled 19 year old me as this man has spent my whole life making sure his children are the center of attention, and pointing out to everyone else (but ESPECIALLY the not his kids) how much better they were.\n\nSo after hearing this grownass man pitch a hissy over what had been a sore subject to me since I was old enough to pick up on it... I just busted up laughing, directly into his face.",

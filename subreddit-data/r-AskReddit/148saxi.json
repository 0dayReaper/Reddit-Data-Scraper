I have realized that the people who work there for years have been stuck in time, they have no idea what has happened to technology recently, since the school does not allow the use of the phone during non-English classes, parents They constantly see you on camera, I suppose they also have a job that wastes their time. Personally, I can't take a job where everything revolves around proto-humans seriously, but most foreign teachers love this job since you do \"nothing\" and then go home to rest.",

Adjusted the time daily to make the internal clock adjust to stay partially awake.\n\nNow the internal clock knows that the first and last hour should be like catlike sleep and the rest 4 hours I'm knocked off, the 1 big issue with this was that I never woke in those 4 hours of REM even when our doorbell was ringing.\n\nSo I set the room temperature to rise when asleep to ensure changes occur in the temperature of the room, didn't wake me at all. I was parched and sweaty when I woke up after my usual 6 hours sleep.\n\nIts ok for now as there are multiple family members at home. But living alone would be troublesome!",

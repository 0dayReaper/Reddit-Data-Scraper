I know that it doesn't define me and I think I have a great personality and judging by the people I've connected with I must be doing something right but of course things are physical and the issue will come up eventually and it's not exactly a thing you want to show to someone your interested in and I know it has meant a few women I've liked have slowly started talking to me less after seeing but I'm not mad about that there's no point stressing over something I can't control and I don't even hate them for it cause it's their decision and I wouldn't want to keep someone around just for my own ego. Of course it has had a detrimental effect on my confidence coming to terms with it and I understand people who let it get to them but I know I am decent at conversation and also learning other things in bed so now I feel good about it but still it can sometimes be a hard thing to admit. \n\nAt one point it nearly ruined my life when a girl I hooked up with told people and everyone started talking about it. I always thought it would just get bigger as I got older so I wasn't too bothered and thought girls would understand but I obviously learned it wouldn't and they knew that too. The first girl to ever see it I could tell she was shocked but she didn't say anything but another one did and she said she would make stuff up if I told any safeguarding people that she spread that about me. And her dad having a prominent place made me even less think about telling because of the power she had over me in that way. Alot of her friends said that she did nothing wrong because she was just saying what it is",

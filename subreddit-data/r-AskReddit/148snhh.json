Revolutionize the world and have my name written next to geniuses like Tesla or Einstein. And also get wealthy enough to do whatever the fuck i want. I'm starting my bachelor in septembre. Yup, it's a pretty big ambition \nOn a smaller scale, i would also like to gather enough courage to ask a girl out before I never see her again, that's my goal for this month",

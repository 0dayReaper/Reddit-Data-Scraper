Sometimes we don't want sex, we just want someone to hold us and tell us everything is going to be be ok. The modern world shouldn't expect someone to be anything other than a contributing member of society, be it any way. Men like power and feeling looked up to, but like women and children, we need someone to love us and someone we can fall back onto. When a man, or even a woman is shutting people out and isolating themselves, they need your love the most. I know this will get buried but I hope someone can take something from this.",

And then when her father walked into the barn, beat the shit out of me while I was still tied up blaming me for seducing his daughter.\n\nHer response was, \"Oh so you got to have sex early, bet the guys loved that\".  \n\nYeah because I was going to brag about that shit.\n\nTo this day I still have the thought in the back of my mind that someone is going to pop up and beat the shit out of me for having sex.  \n\n\nWhich is honestly why I don't pursue partners that often, which in turn means a ton of time in singledom.\n\nShit's fucked, I know at no point was it my fault, but stuff is messed up, and working though those issues with a person who actually is understanding of that in a relationship just seems like too big of a fucking stretch. Therapy helps but at the end of the day having relationships end because I can't get over my shit, just makes it feel like it's not worth the hurt that comes when they end.",

When I finally was able to not only utter the word \"rape\" to myself, but also to others, the first comment I got from one of the male figures in my life was \"men can't be raped by women, so if you want to be a real man, you'll suck it up.\" I was 18 or 19, had been a virgin before, and got two STDs from the assault. I have never forgiven that. I was literally not allowed to discuss what happened to me. It wasn't until several years later that I ever heard another man actually understand instead of call me unmanly. And I can say as a fact, since I'm a trans man, that this expectation is not the same in women. I was allowed to be a victim as a woman, but as a man I was expected to never feel and just get over it, or worse, enjoy it.\n\nFuck that noise. I'm tired of seeing my friends suffer in silence or drown in a bottle. There are so many men in my life who have substance abuse problems because their social networks refused to allow them to be in pain. I've had a Devil Dog stumble into my home at 2am to cling to me and cry, and sleep in my bed just so he's not alone with his nightmares, because his girlfriend wouldn't be there for him. She thought he was weak. I've watched my father slowly retreat into himself behind a cloud of pot smoke because no one let him say \"a man molested me\" without calling him gay or weak. I'm tired of watching men suffer. It's fucked up.\n\nThe worst part for me was how many of the men in my life I looked up to that pushed me towards alcohol and burying my feelings. Therapy was for girls. Real men don't talk about feelings. Those same dudes wondered why I became an alcoholic. Society is so hostile to the pain of men in so many ways, because it's seen as weakness.\n\nEdit; Holy shit, for a comment I posted offhand in a coffee shop, this blew up. Thank y'all for the comments and support. I hope that me sharing this has helped some of y'all feel less alone or like you can make it through whatever you're dealing with. You're not alone. No matter how lonely and isolating this kind of thing feels, you are not alone. Please never hesitate to reach out if you need it. You are deserving of love and help.",

They set up an experiment in a bar: a couple walks in, noisily engage in conversation that lets everyone else at the bar know they are just meeting for the first time, then, while one of them heads for the restroom, the other spikes their drink.\n\nWhen it was the women being drugged, everyone at the bar was saying \"when she gets back we need to tell her\", which they then did. Sometimes they verbally or physically confronted the man, or called the police.  When it was the man being drugged, they all laughed and said \"well, *he's* going to have an interesting night\", then just sat there suppressing giggles as the woman returned and led the 'drugged' guy out of the bar.\n\n(I just tried to find this on youtube to link the video, couldn't find it in the hundreds of \"date rape social experiment\" videos that now exist, a few of which have descriptions like \"enjoy the funniest pranks\".)\n\nIt's not a contest, anyone can be violated. But when we (men) talk about it, we get buried under an avalanche of \"women/trans/etc have it so much worse\", as though I am diluting their experience by sharing mine. It feels like... going to the hospital with burns over 30% of my body, and being told \"quit your whining, that person over there has burns over *40%* of their body\". Yeah, but... it still burns.",

Only the thickest one, connected to the big toe, didn't break. Metatarsals I think they're called.\n\nI was like 12 or 13. \n\nThis incompetent doctor put a small, worthless foam shoe on my foot, a foam shoe that I later found was only for use in conjunction with a plaster cast to give you some traction. \n\nAnd this bastard just told me to walk it off, that it wasn't broken. That was literally his advice. Walk it off. \n\nI did that for 2 weeks, trying to \"be a man.\" \n\nKnowing my foot was broken because I had heard the sound of thick sticks snapping when I fell on it wrong. And of course the pain, once the adrenaline wore off.\n\nHe didn't even give me crutches.\n\nI came back for a check up 2 weeks after the injury because obviously this quack's instructions did not help me, so he *finally* took x-rays and they were put up on this light up board in a hallway, and I happened to be sitting by them on a chair, when a different doctor came by, he walked by, then did that backwards walk thing when you're so focused on something you can't leave the room and start moonwalking.\n\nHe had noticed me and the x-ray, and he asked me if that was an x-ray of my foot. He also noticed my stupid little blue foam shoe on my foot with no cast on underneath.\n\nI told him yes, that's my foot.\n\nAnd I saw something I still can't believe.\n\nIt was like an episode of a hospital show. \n\nHe went in a room and grabbed the quack by the throat and slammed him against the wall! And just said one thing \"this is my patient now.\" \n\nAnd then he shoved him by the throat and came back to me and told me he would be taking over my care.\n\nHe studied my x-rays and then I had to \"be a man\" again.\n\nHe took me aside and he goes \"I know your family can't afford surgery. The surgery to fix this will cost at least $5,000. But if you can handle it, I'll rebreak your bones and put them back into place with my hands. You can never tell anyone or I'll get fired.\"\n\nSo I was like \"okay. lets do it.\" And it sucked. But he crammed my foot bones back in line and put a plaster cast on and gave me crutches and now I'm still walking around today, 20 years later. He's probably retired by now.\n\nThanks, Dr. L., for helping me and my family. I still don't know how to be a man but I will always keep trying to be more like you.",

I mean it's telling that you start off saying you have no friends that you see or socialize with but then describe her as having a circle of friends. \n\nThe primary issue is in how men bond versus how women bond. Women can maintain very close relationships by simply talking over the phone. I'm obviously generalizing here, not every woman likes to spend 2 hours on the phone, some prefer texting, blah blah, the point is that they bond through TALKING. \n\nMen on the other hand bond through ACTIVITIES. It's pretty fucking hard to do an activity over the phone. Online gaming and voice chat has actually helped A LOT with this problem but most of the men suffering through this are going to have a hell of a time convincing their wife to let them game for 2 hours a night with their buddies. I mean you ever walk into a bar with two old dudes? They're barely even looking at each other, they're usually sitting on the same side watching whatever game is on the TV. \n\nSo yes the same can be said for your wife but it's not nearly the problem it is for her as it is for you and we need to stop pretending that there are no differences between men and women and we're all the same. Loneliness will fucking kill you and while it makes you feel like an asshole for even thinking that you might be lonely while you live in a house with a loving wife and your child(ren) it doesn't mean it's not true.",

Came over to my place while my fiance was out of town and we just played video games together.  For about 6 hours we just chilled and played video games.  When my fiance came home she started asking what we \"talked about\", if we talked about \"her or our relationship\" or basically anything else.  When I told her \"no, we barely talked unless it was about the game, but mostly just played games\". \n\nShe actually got upset about this, not to an extreme level or anything but she didn't think it was a good use of our time.  She just didn't like it really, so much so that she doesn't really believe all we did is play video games and did not talk about deep personal issues.\n\nThe thing is, it was what I really needed.  We talked about the games, he got to try VR for the first time.  Shit, I didn't even give him a tour of my house that he's never been in before, we just went straight to the game room and started playing.  We didn't even drink, it was just good to play video games with someone who doesn't ask so many damn questions, or needs help understanding the concepts. \n\nWhat I don't understand is we have 2 boys, the 5 year old lives with us full time and has his friends over a lot.  When his friends are over they are not having \"conversations\" they are playing or playing video games.  She sees that and doesn't question why him and his friends are not talking to one another about school or what their other friends said, they are simply spending time together.  \n\nYet suddenly the fact that my friend and I didn't play a round of 50 questions was not time well spent.  She can and does talk to her friends for hours on the phone, I don't.  What little time I get to spend with my friends we are doing something; even if its basically just work (working on a car or project).",

I'll meet dudes that I think are pretty cool and I could see myself hanging out with but where does it go? So you reach out let's say and see if they wanna do something. Busy. They do the same. Now you're busy. They reach out again and \"eh... I don't really feel like it, I've been so busy, I kind of just wanna chill out at home and beat this game\" and it goes on and on until you both just give up and see each other whenever your girlfriends hang out or if they shop at your store or whatever the case is. \n\nI've got a good buddy of mine that I talk to pretty regularly through fb chat but I have literally never hung out with him outside of work related things where he will help me with a trade show or he'll pass by to pick something up or drop something off and we'll chat a big. Like now that I think of it I have literally never once hung out with this guy outside of situations like I just described. He has 2 kids, he basically can't do shit. He usually helps me with trade shows but he had to pass on the one coming up this weekend (and I couldn't find anyone else in time to go) because saturday he has basketball and there was no way his wife was going to let him have 2 days outside of the house even though the sunday with me would involve him working and making money. \n\nWhen I really noticed it was when my group of online friends started to get busy and not game as often but when they would game they played a game I didn't enjoy. I didn't realize how much I was getting out of those sessions until they were gone and I was left thinking \"why the fuck am I so lonely? nothing's change?\"",

We pick a game a month, everyone plays it, then we meet up and talk about what we liked or didn't like about it. It can be hard to pick a game especially sense everyone needs to buy it, but there are a ton of great steam/indie games out there or old used games you can pick up for cheap. \n\nIt's been a hit and I can't recommend it enough.\n\nObligatory blow up edit:  \nThis thread blew up and I had a lot of people that expressed interest in joining. Given the nature of this thread I really feel like I need to give back. Someone made a subreddit /r/steamgameclub in response to this thread. Please join it if you feel like you need people to play games with. I\u2019ll be there to help organize discord groups, discussions, and whatever I can do help get everyone together.",

For so long, men have been taught that they always have to be hard and tough to be \"real men\". It's time to break that cycle and have fathers show their sons and daughter that it's okay to feel all da emotions. That it's okay to cry, it's okay to be vulnerable and open up about your struggles. \n\n\\- Accepting that men can also be victims of physical/emotional abuse and rape, and providing as much support for them as we do for women. \n\n\\- LISTEN TO EACH OTHER, it's pointless telling men to open up about their feelings if no one is there to take them seriously.\n\n\\- Body shaming is just as bad when it's directed at a man. Men receive so little compliments, tell them they're looking fit!\n\nEdit: thank you so much for the gold! I\u2019m finding the discussion in the replies so interesting and am so glad to be a part of it. You people raised some great points, I\u2019ll reply later but just to clear up a few things...\n\nWhen I say let men cry and show feelings, I do not mean they need to start crying and mull over every little thing. All I\u2019m saying is that there needs to be a healthy balance between expressing and regulating your emotions. Everyone has different coping mechanisms. Yes, at times it\u2019s necessary to \u201cjust suck it up\u201d, to do what you gotta do. However, it\u2019s not healthy to just suppress every negative emotion (Something that\u2019s still often encouraged in our society). Not only does this cause things to build up, eventually destroying your mental health, but also, it inhibits you from learning how to communicate your feelings (good and bad) to people. \nIf something hurts, then it fucking hurts. If it upsets you to the point of tears, that\u2019s okay! Let it all out, there\u2019s no shaming here! Girlfriend broke up with you and you need to just talk it out? Call up your friend! Tell them how this really sucks and how they can support you. Don\u2019t feel like talking to anyone about it? That\u2019s okay too! Let your friends know that you\u2019re going through a hard time and you can fill them in later if you want to, after you\u2019ve had your time alone. \n\nIn short, let\u2019s break down those outdated gender norms and start using those healthy coping mechanisms, cheers!",

In addition men, on average, have fewer close friends and feel lonelier than women. I think the fatigue of such a life can be quite draining. \n\nI don't think the problem is that men do not talk about their feelings. I think the problem is that they often don't have someone to talk to. \nIn addition, it can be quite hard to make new friends. Especially when you are past your twenties. You know, people you are potentially interested in are married and have kids. They are preoccupied with their own lives. \n\nI felt very lonely and sad after my last long term relationship ended. It took me over 6 months to find new friends and I'm a hardcore extrovert. Still, I made a bunch of new friends within the past year or so. \n\nI'd like to encourage anyone who feels lonely to put yourself out there. Talk to people. If you like them, ask them if they like to hang out with you. Do you know how I became friends with one of my best friends? I straight up told him that I felt lonely and that I like him and would like to become friends with him. \nAnd for those of you who already have plenty of friends and a busy life: Maybe make some room for people in your community who aren't as blessed as you are.",

We are failing our precious boys.\n\nStudies have also shown that modern schooling, from kindergarten through grad school, disproportionately favors styles more beneficial to women. Younger boys for instance aren't given the recess time to properly burn off excess energy, which leads to difficulties focusing in class and over-medication of young boys. Colleges are seeing women graduating at increasingly higher rates over men as well. None of that is bad to be clear, but we shouldn't ignore that men are falling behind.\n\nI think what society has been able to do to empower women is excellent and needs to continue, but that we need to start working to make similar improvements for men as well. \n\nIt's a hard subject to discuss without facing opposition claiming sexism, but the reality is that this is not a zero sum game. Society can do better to provide modern solutions for men's problems without compromising on what we're doing already for women. We should work to maintain the growth rates women are seeing in graduation numbers while also working to bring men up to those same rates for instance.\n\nIssues like the lack of (and even public push back against) battered men's shelters highlights that as a society we're failing to acknowledge the issues that men face have evolved and need to be acknowledged in the same way we do so for women's issues. As women take a more equal role in society it should be expected that men begin to face issues traditionally associated with women and vice versa.",

Why? Because I had a ton of energy, asked too many questions, and spoke to much.  IMAGINE TRYING TO LABEL SOMEONE A PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS AS AN 8 YEAR OLD KID.  \n\nAnyway, years later my life is great, went to a top school and have a job i love, and that bitch ended up with triplets - all boys too - so I sure hope she adjusted to young boys. \n\nPoint is yes, many schools and teachers are not equipped for adolescent boys.",

Otherwise you're left with a sense of discomfort, a nauseating sickening twisting in your gut and a sense that *something* is wrong. You're not sure what, just that things aren't right and you need it to stop right now. You drink, you punch the wall, you hurt yourself. You try to cry but tears don't come because all you know about crying is, \"Man up.\" \"Grow up.\" \"Boys don't cry.\"\n\nYou try to tell people you're not okay, a shrug when they ask how things are going. Telling people who care about you, you're not feeling so great or are having a bad week. But the lacklustre way, that is the only way, you feel comfortable talking about how you feel doesn't draw the help it needs, and why would it.. or should it? You're a man, you shouldn't ask for help, or even *need* it. You deal with these things alone because you're a rock, a pillar of support, the one who stays calm when things go wrong.\n\nSo instead of unloading, or dealing with the issues they get carried, bottled up, pushed down, hidden. You desensitise yourself to them however you can and remain stoic. But eventually even stone crumbles and when it does it's too late. There's too much, it's overwhelming. You don't even know where to start, the only thing you know is you want it to stop, *need* it to stop. And admitting you need help now would only make it hurt more, but you're sure you can't stand another ounce of pain, so you take the only option available...",

I definitely think that colleges making their campuses a safe, healthy place for women is extremely important, but they should be doing it for men as well. I realize men don't have to deal with sexual assault and other issues nearly to the same extent as women, but there are many other factors that can contribute to a student's well-being. I think, especially in the formative years while young men and women are in college, they should be given resources to deal with whatever is causing them to feel anxious, depressed, alone, etc.",

For instance, a man used to go into the woods and hunt an animal.  It was very difficult, but when he came home with meat, his family could eat and everyone was thankful that they aren't eating soup again.  Everyone loves dad.\n\n\nBut today, a man might go into the office, input some data, crunch some numbers, sign some paperwork... But what is he doing?  Does his wife and kids appreciate it?  Not as much.\n\n\nAnd it's not just work.  Men used to mow their lawn, change their oil, repair things around the house, etc.  But now all of that stuff is hired out to others.\n\n\n\nThe result is that they don't feel useful or appreciated.  And if they aren't useful, what is their purpose?\n\n\nIt's kind of like generating vs consuming content.  If you sit and watch YouTube all day every day, you will start to feel like a pretty worthless piece of shit.  But if you *create* YouTube videos, you would feel like you're doing something.  Like you have a purpose.  That applies to life in general.  People are increasingly consuming more and creating less.\n\n\n\nI have noticed that when I start to feel down and depressed it's because of this.  It's usually when I haven't had any little \"wins\" in my life and I have just been kind of floating through and going through the motions.\n\n\nIf I let that go for too long, I could see how it could lead to deep dark depression.\n\n\n\nSo what can we do?  Women, show your men affection and appreciation.  Even if they don't do much good, at least show appreciation for the little good they do to motivate them to do better and grow.  And men, do something.  Help out around the house, fix something, draw something, do something nice for your partner or your kids, learn another language, learn a musical instrument, build something..... Just be productive and try to limit the time you are *consuming*. (TV, video games, browsing the internet, reading fiction, social media, etc)   You'll feel much more accomplished and healthy when you have more to offer the world, those around you, and yourself.",

There's a discussion on a different board about skilled &amp; unskilled labor....your post articulated something that was on my mind but I hadn't been able to convey.  The sense of work that is purposeful, healthy, and makes a tangible, better difference in the world.  I think that was lost in the discussion (e.g. confusing pay/how long it took to acquire skills, etc. with the doing a job/whatever the pay that adds value to the world).",

                    "comment": "What you explained is actually one of the criticisms of industrial society mentioned in the Unabomber's manifesto: how quickly modernization has changed what Kaczynski calls the \"power process\", goal-setting, and artificial fulfillment of needs.\n\n&gt;Human beings have a need (probably based in biology) for something that we will call the \u201cpower process.\u201d The power process has four elements. The three most clear-cut of these we call 1) Goal 2) Effort and 3) Attainment of goal. Everyone needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals. When people do not have to exert themselves to satisfy their physical needs [because they are already provided for in modern society] they often set up artificial goals for themselves. We use the term \u201csurrogate activity\u201d to designate [these activities] that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the sake of the \u201cfulfillment\u201d that they get from pursuing the goal. [These surrogate activities can prove unfulfilling and give us a false sense of accomplishment or leave us constantly wanting more without ever feeling satisfied or as if we have done something worthwhile].\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;The fourth element is more difficult to define and may not be necessary for everyone. We call it autonomy. Their efforts must be undertaken on their own initiative and must be under their own direction and control. Yet most people do not have to exert this initiative, direction and control as single individuals. It is usually enough to act as a member of a small group.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt; For most people it is through the power process\u2014having a goal, making an AUTONOMOUS effort and attaining the goal\u2014that self-esteem, self-confidence and a sense of power are acquired. When one does not have adequate opportunity to go through the power process the consequences are (depending on the individual and on the way the power process is disrupted) boredom, demoralization, low self-esteem, inferiority feelings, defeatism, depression, anxiety, guilt, frustration, hostility, spouse or child abuse, insatiable hedonism, abnormal sexual behavior, sleep disorders, eating disorders, etc.\n\nIf you're interested in the idea, *Finite and Infinite Games* is an interesting book that uses game theory to explain how we sustain ourselves and set goals.",

            "comment": "Although we are \"allowed\"  encouraged to be open about how we feel or think, we can't. If something is a genuine problem and we verbalise it, the reaction is almost always others jumping down our throat as we have no right to complain, or mocking as we have supposedly been living privileged.  \n\nIt's become worse in recent years as we literally have to tiptoe around while being blamed for everything generations before us supposedly did. Most men alive today had no part in anything that was done to others. We were born into a different world where we have always been on the back foot, yet carry a lot of the blame and stigma from things we had nothing to do with.  I'm expecting this post to get mass downvoted purely for openly saying what I personally live and experience.  We don't talk about that shit because it get's hammered back at us, so we shut the fuck up and just keep going until we break, then everyone is like \"oh you should have said something\" No, we shouldnt as it just creates more stress and makes things more difficult. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou want to help, then create an environment for men equal to that of everyone else instead of dwelling on the doings of long dead people and putting men seperate and last.  The thing about equality is that EVERYONE is equal regardless of gender, sexuality and age etc.\n\nPeople want to know what can be done to help, but when they know it just gets buried again. It's easier to just not bring it up so we don't face all the BS and drama about how hard everyone else has it as if we live in golden castles. Too many people see the world through decades old rose tinted glasses. Things need to change.",

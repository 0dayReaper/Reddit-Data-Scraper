The images, sounds, and emotions are etched into my mind, making it difficult to shake off the residual effects. Sometimes, I find myself questioning what's real and what's just a creation of my own subconscious.",

When I woke up I found myself drenched in sweat and with a headache from the emotional turmoil I had just experienced.",

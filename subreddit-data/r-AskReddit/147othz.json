I always finished tests fast enough that Id be bored shitless for the next 45 minutes and we weren\u2019t allowed to do anything else so I just slept.\n\nLater, I realized that if I just read ahead in the book on my own time and learned the material (which was faster) that I could sleep through class if I wanted to because any time the teacher asked if I was paying attention and to answer the question, I knew the answer so they never really fucked with me.\n\nFreshman year of highschool I got called to the counselor to make sure everything was alright at home because all of my teachers reported that I was sleeping through class.  I told him I was just bored and to pull up my grades.  I had A\u2019s in every class so he just shrugged and told me to keep up the good work.",

I insisted, \"but I'm hungry...\" and then *lied* and said \"they forgot to feed me.\" I claimed I was in the bathroom or something during lunch so I didn't get any.\n\nMy mom went *ballistic.* She called the daycare right then, sitting in the car (early days of cellphones) and gave them hell. After she hung up - just as I was thinking I won - she declared we were not going to McD's, and I'd just gotten myself grounded for lying, to boot, and how embarassed she was at having just yelled at staff who had been good to us just because I wanted McD's, and that I owed them an apology the next morning.\n\nNot only did the daycare staff know they gave me lunch, they knew which of the 2 sandwich options I had eaten and exactly how many pieces (quarter-of-a-sandwich sized) I had eaten.\n\nLesson learned, kids: don't lie. The truth will always come out and bite you in the @$$.",

It was an American thing (which I am not) and I was super excited for the food because we've never had anything like that before. My mom saw the excitement and used it. The condition was that if I can go a week without a grade lower than a B in my gradebook journal I get to go to McDonald's. What my mom didn't realize is that I was an aspiring artist, at the end of every week I would go into the grade book and work magic with a correction pen. I had 2 trips to McDonald's before mom noticed the corrections. After that she started checking my grades under direct light to see if any alterations were done AND had my older sister (who was in the same school building) talk to my teachers frequently to know how I'm really doing.",

Another time, they'd just had a new patio put in and I saw the paving slabs as big canvs, so I drew a family of stick men on one of them thinking  it was fine because it would wash off. It was permanent marker. I still remember seeing them faintly years later.",

I was horrible at remembering to get my parents to sign it. \n\nOne Monday morning, I realized I forgot to get it signed before my parents left for work, so I thought I could get away with forging my mother's signature. After the 10th try with a pencil, I was proud of how similar it looked! Turned it in that morning not thinking about all of the eraser marks left behind from my previous attempts. \n\nThat night during a conversation with my mother, she looked at me and said, \"I'm really glad you got that report turned in on time today. It's funny how I don't remember signing it.\" And then she left it at that. I immediately knew I was caught and the guilt ate me alive until I slipped a note under my mom's pillow confessing to my crime. Never heard anything about it, but I quickly learned I'm bad at lying.",

I don\u2019t know if they still wear them today so if you never heard of them they are jackets with the school\u2019s colors and insignia or initials of the school. They also would have badges to show if you were on the football team, baseball team, etc. To me they were like superhero uniforms. I envied anyone that wore them. My sister happened to be dating one of the guys on the football team and he owned one. One day I came home and I saw it lying on her bed. The girls sometimes wore them to show they were dating the guys. She wasn\u2019t home. I immediately tried it on and looked at myself in the mirror. But that wasn\u2019t good enough for me. I got my bike and rode down to the mall and walked around wearing it. I felt so cool. After awhile I biked back home and to my horror the guy\u2019s car was in our driveway. I knew this was going to be bad. The only thing I could think of was to stash the jacket in the garage. I walked in and my sister immediately started freaking out. \u201cWHERE IS IT? WHERE IS IT?\u201c My mom, the boyfriend and her were all standing in the living room. I knew I was busted so I walked into the garage and handed it to her. She inspected it like I tried to set it on fire all the while continuing to shriek \u201cI TOLD YOU. I TOLD YOU IT WAS HIM.\u201c I felt humiliated. After it all died down I was sitting in my room with my head down. The boyfriend stuck his head in and said \u201cHey man, you can wear the jacket if you want. Just don\u2019t lose it, OK?\u201d That only made me feel like a bigger idiot.",

I was reading *The Lightning Thief* at the time and didn't want to put it on hold to read something else. So, I, being a little rebel, decided to cheat and watch the movie adaptation. So on the day I got assigned the book report, after school, I went over to a friends house to watch the movie and spend the night. I told my parents we had a science project we needed to do, so they agreed to let me spend the night. So I watched the movie, wrote my report, turned it in, and the next day, I got my report back and got a D. My teacher asked me what happened. I said that I watched the movie adaptation of the book I was assigned because I didn't think it would matter. My teacher decided to call my parents and have a meeting with them after school. So they came in, and the situation went downhill real fast. I said to them, \"Well, if I knew it made a difference, I would've read the book. How was I to know?\" My teacher did not appreciate such backtalk. So here I am, fucking losing my shit, desperately trying to tell my disgruntled parents that on any OTHER day they'd be mad at me for NOT doing my homework, since they demanded good grades from me under threat of death. They then gave me a long lecture about honesty and not cheating. I was given a two hour detention the next day and had to write a two-page essay on why cheating is bad. So I served my detention, wrote the essay, and that was that. Those two nights at home were not fun, let me tell you.",

I spotted it, decided to nab it because I could reach it, and I was taught that money is everything growing up. Upon holding this money I realized that we were about to leave for school and my dad would walk into the living room any second and see it was missing, and he was abusive so this was a real issue, I was scared I'd get caught putting it back, so instead I shoved it into my brother's backpack (I'm special so our dad only hit me, never raised a finger at the others) and called it a day. A minute later my dad comes bursting outside to where we're waiting for him losing his mind that this money is missing (looking back rightfully so, he was paying rent after dropping us off) and freaking out at us because obviously it was one of us. He checks our pockets- nothing. Onto the backpacks- here I'm thinking I'm an absolute genius, Einstein type shit, I'm golden. Checks my bag- nothing, checks my sisters- nothing, checks my brothers- surprise surprise! He finds the money and turns to me and my sister, looking even more angry- I'd made a fatal mistake. You see, while I was tall enough to reach the top of the mantle, my two year old brother was definitely not, oops. Anyways cue more yelling 'IM GONNA FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE OF YOU FUCKERS TRIED STEALING FROM ME BAH BAH BAH' and he takes us to school, about a week later I broke down crying from guilt and admitted that I stole it to my aunt. If the beating I got wasn't enough I was branded as a liar and a thief by my dad, and then there was just one more reason for him to hate me. Looking back I see this as a pretty funny story, but I had a kinda fucked up childhood so I guess it's up to you to decide if this is funny or sad lol",

I remember hearing her saying to the Principal, \u201cWell he said he was moving to Texas!\u201d. \n\nMaybe don\u2019t take the word of a 9 year old.",

            "comment": "I was in first grade and, in a desperate attempt to gain acceptance, I told a bunch of kids that frequently bullied me that my house was infested with leprechauns. To my surprise, it worked. They stopped calling me names for a moment and started asking a lot of questions. Suddenly I was interesting to them and I began to bask in that sweet, sweet acceptance by my peers as I answered their questions. Imagine my surprise when they asked to come over and go leprechaun hunting. \n\nI couldn\u2019t back out now. By god, they were coming over and they expected to see a house lousy with gold-hoarding, river-dancing, genuine leprechauns. What could I do? I had never before (nor since) seen so much as a leprechaun footprint in my house, so I did what any rational person would do: I put my future well-being in the hands of the universe in hopes that it would see my predicament and, just this once, make a leprechaun appear at my house on the right day at the right time. Despite this approach not deserving even a whisper of optimism, I thought it was a sure bet. The bullying resumed shortly after a thorough search of my house yielded not one single leprechaun.",

For some reason my brother confided in me that he had a crush on a girl who was his friend in his class. Then we never spoke about it again. Like literally never and I was embarrassed AF about knowing this.\n\nThe girl eventually moved out of town and that was that. One day we get a phone call and I am the one to pick it up. Who is it? It's the girl my brother had a crush on. She asks for him and I am so tongue tied that I blurt that he is out of the house (no idea why - he was in the next room). She was calling as she was in town briefly.\n\nThen I go back to our room and my mother asks who it was for? My brother is also there so i am shitting bricks because I will be fucked before I say \"it's X\" in front of my brother who has a crush on X and knows that I know it.\n\nSo instead, I - the genius - quickly come up with the name of another guy friend of his (who also moved out of town) and say \"He is in town and wants to meet you\"\n\nSo my brother goes to the house of this other guy and his mother says \"He is still in a different town, I don't know what you are talking about\"\n\nHe came back and told mom, and they yelled at me for a few minutes until I said \"You know what? Maybe I misheard and it was girl X who was in town\" hoping against hope that it would work.\n\nI still don't know if it actually worked or if my brother knew that his kid bro was being weird again.",

Well before I went home, I gently used a Sharpie to brush vertical lines on the minus to make it a plus.  Fooled my parents.\n\nProblem is, I have an extremely nosey sister who is still extremely nosey to this day, despite rapidly approaching our forties. \n\nShe needed to know absolutely everything - my report card, my grades, hell, as kids she would even stand over me at the dentist and demand to know how many cavities I had and tell the dentist I didn't brush regularly.\n\nSo my sister grabs my report card, sees that the felt pen I used was a different shade, and runs and tells my parents it's a forgery.  They told me they were going to tell my teacher, and since I had such an intense fear of authority figures like teachers, I pretty much thought my entire life was over.  \n\nSo for weeks I would wake up, remember I did that, and have panic attacks and intense shame.  Then they finally told me they weren't going to tell my teacher.  \n\nI already felt discriminated against from teachers at school, I didn't need this, too.",

I always finished tests fast enough that Id be bored shitless for the next 45 minutes and we weren\u2019t allowed to do anything else so I just slept.\n\nLater, I realized that if I just read ahead in the book on my own time and learned the material (which was faster) that I could sleep through class if I wanted to because any time the teacher asked if I was paying attention and to answer the question, I knew the answer so they never really fucked with me.\n\nFreshman year of highschool I got called to the counselor to make sure everything was alright at home because all of my teachers reported that I was sleeping through class.  I told him I was just bored and to pull up my grades.  I had A\u2019s in every class so he just shrugged and told me to keep up the good work.",

I insisted, \"but I'm hungry...\" and then *lied* and said \"they forgot to feed me.\" I claimed I was in the bathroom or something during lunch so I didn't get any.\n\nMy mom went *ballistic.* She called the daycare right then, sitting in the car (early days of cellphones) and gave them hell. After she hung up - just as I was thinking I won - she declared we were not going to McD's, and I'd just gotten myself grounded for lying, to boot, and how embarassed she was at having just yelled at staff who had been good to us just because I wanted McD's, and that I owed them an apology the next morning.\n\nNot only did the daycare staff know they gave me lunch, they knew which of the 2 sandwich options I had eaten and exactly how many pieces (quarter-of-a-sandwich sized) I had eaten.\n\nLesson learned, kids: don't lie. The truth will always come out and bite you in the @$$.",

It was an American thing (which I am not) and I was super excited for the food because we've never had anything like that before. My mom saw the excitement and used it. The condition was that if I can go a week without a grade lower than a B in my gradebook journal I get to go to McDonald's. What my mom didn't realize is that I was an aspiring artist, at the end of every week I would go into the grade book and work magic with a correction pen. I had 2 trips to McDonald's before mom noticed the corrections. After that she started checking my grades under direct light to see if any alterations were done AND had my older sister (who was in the same school building) talk to my teachers frequently to know how I'm really doing.",

Booooo, lol.\n\n I've just realised I had quite  a big drawing habit. Once I got a fistful of crayons and did an arc on the wall - a beautiful rainbow. Got banned from that room until I was bogger. Another time, they'd just had a new patio put in and I saw the paving slabs as big canvs, so I drew a family of stick men on one of them thinking  it was fine because it would wash off. It was permanent marker. I still remember seeing them faintly years later.",

After the 10th try with a pencil, I was proud of how similar it looked! Turned it in that morning not thinking about all of the eraser marks left behind from my previous attempts. \n\nThat night during a conversation with my mother, she looked at me and said, \"I'm really glad you got that report turned in on time today. It's funny how I don't remember signing it.\" And then she left it at that. I immediately knew I was caught and the guilt ate me alive until I slipped a note under my mom's pillow confessing to my crime.

I had my classmate Christopher kiss the card, I traced out he pattern in pencil, went over it with whiteout so it would be thick like lipstick, then painted over it with red and then added lip balm over the top of it so it would seem like real lipstick to the touch.\n\nWhy did I do this in 2nd grade? No idea! It wasn't even intended as a prank. I just did it. I remember thinking how funny it was that he was gonna get a card with a boy's kiss mark on it.\n\nThey weren't even mad at me when it all got revealed. I don't even think they were satisfied with the resolution. Just mystified.\n\nI remember getting called in to their room,\n\n\"Did you make this?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"School!\"\n\n\\*proceeds to excitedly explain the crafting process like a kid showing off their Pokemon\\*\n\nAs I got older I understood the confusion when I learned that my step-dad was caught cheating because he hid the receipts for the gifts he bought the ladies in the GLOVE COMPARTMENT OF THE FAMILY CAR. You know, the glove compartment that the person he's trying to hide them from sits in front of every time we drive anywhere.",

I don\u2019t know if they still wear them today so if you never heard of them they are jackets with the school\u2019s colors and insignia or initials of the school. They also would have badges to show if you were on the football team, baseball team, etc. To me they were like superhero uniforms. I envied anyone that wore them. My sister happened to be dating one of the guys on the football team and he owned one. One day I came home and I saw it lying on her bed. The girls sometimes wore them to show they were dating the guys. She wasn\u2019t home. I immediately tried it on and looked at myself in the mirror. But that wasn\u2019t good enough for me. I got my bike and rode down to the mall and walked around wearing it. I felt so cool. After awhile I biked back home and to my horror the guy\u2019s car was in our driveway. I knew this was going to be bad. The only thing I could think of was to stash the jacket in the garage. I walked in and my sister immediately started freaking out. \u201cWHERE IS IT? WHERE IS IT?\u201c My mom, the boyfriend and her were all standing in the living room. I knew I was busted so I walked into the garage and handed it to her. She inspected it like I tried to set it on fire all the while continuing to shriek \u201cI TOLD YOU. I TOLD YOU IT WAS HIM.\u201c I felt humiliated. After it all died down I was sitting in my room with my head down. The boyfriend stuck his head in and said \u201cHey man, you can wear the jacket if you want. Just don\u2019t lose it, OK?\u201d That only made me feel like a bigger idiot.",

She was there with her mom. We made eye contact and she called out to us \"hey, remember when you guys said you were both busy and couldn't hang out with me?\"\n\nIt was the most awkward thing ever and I felt really guilty.

I was reading *The Lightning Thief* at the time and didn't want to put it on hold to read something else. So, I, being a little rebel, decided to cheat and watch the movie adaptation. So on the day I got assigned the book report, after school, I went over to a friends house to watch the movie and spend the night. I told my parents we had a science project we needed to do, so they agreed to let me spend the night. So I watched the movie, wrote my report, turned it in, and the next day, I got my report back and got a D. My teacher asked me what happened. I said that I watched the movie adaptation of the book I was assigned because I didn't think it would matter. My teacher decided to call my parents and have a meeting with them after school. So they came in, and the situation went downhill real fast. I said to them, \"Well, if I knew it made a difference, I would've read the book. How was I to know?\" My teacher did not appreciate such backtalk. So here I am, fucking losing my shit, desperately trying to tell my disgruntled parents that on any OTHER day they'd be mad at me for NOT doing my homework, since they demanded good grades from me under threat of death. They then gave me a long lecture about honesty and not cheating. I was given a two hour detention the next day and had to write a two-page essay on why cheating is bad. So I served my detention, wrote the essay, and that was that. Those two nights at home were not fun, let me tell you.",

I spotted it, decided to nab it because I could reach it, and I was taught that money is everything growing up. Upon holding this money I realized that we were about to leave for school and my dad would walk into the living room any second and see it was missing, and he was abusive so this was a real issue, I was scared I'd get caught putting it back, so instead I shoved it into my brother's backpack (I'm special so our dad only hit me, never raised a finger at the others) and called it a day. A minute later my dad comes bursting outside to where we're waiting for him losing his mind that this money is missing (looking back rightfully so, he was paying rent after dropping us off) and freaking out at us because obviously it was one of us. He checks our pockets- nothing. Onto the backpacks- here I'm thinking I'm an absolute genius, Einstein type shit, I'm golden. Checks my bag- nothing, checks my sisters- nothing, checks my brothers- surprise surprise! He finds the money and turns to me and my sister, looking even more angry- I'd made a fatal mistake. You see, while I was tall enough to reach the top of the mantle, my two year old brother was definitely not, oops. Anyways cue more yelling 'IM GONNA FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE OF YOU FUCKERS TRIED STEALING FROM ME BAH BAH BAH' and he takes us to school, about a week later I broke down crying from guilt and admitted that I stole it to my aunt. If the beating I got wasn't enough I was branded as a liar and a thief by my dad, and then there was just one more reason for him to hate me. Looking back I see this as a pretty funny story, but I had a kinda fucked up childhood so I guess it's up to you to decide if this is funny or sad lol",

He of course ratted me out to the teacher and I got in trouble.  Thankfully she didn't call my parents.  \n\nI have no clue why I said that as I was generally a good kid.  Trying to be cool I guess?",

I believe this happened on a Friday. \n\nShe was **pissed**, and fully planned to have a talk with the teacher to figure out who cut my hair. Until she moved the entertainment center to vacuum, and found my cut pile of hair.\n\nI didn't flush it, or even put it in the trash can, or even toss it outside. I put it behind the TV lmao",

I told my parents I ate my lunch and it was good, so I had to get rid of the evidence. Naturally, I flushed it down the toilet. This is the little lie. \n\nWent out somewhere to hang with friends or something and I came home to my parents both cleaning up the floor with all the bath towels in our house. The toiled clogged and water poured out all over the bathroom floor and started coming out of the main floor pot lights (bathroom was upstairs). Somehow the clogged toilet didn\u2019t kick up any of my secret salad mess. They never found out what I did. I feel like an asshole! A bunch of the lights had to get replaced \ud83d\ude1e",

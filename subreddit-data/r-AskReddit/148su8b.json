I excitedly told the barista that I was heading off to an interview, and a man who was cafe regular and a bit of a loser heard me and gave me the advice that I should always turn up to job interviews drunk, as that way the employer would think I normally behaved that way so therefore I wouldn\u2019t get fired if a snuck in a few beers at lunchtime. The sad thing is that he was completely serious.",

            "comment": "\"Keep doing what you're doing\" I was asking how I could do better at work and what to improve on. I finally got a promotion but I feel like I didn't earn it because I do less now than I ever have and people are proud of that? I was denied a raise twice when I thought I fully deserved one, then everyone got a raise. Then 3 of the original crew got their own raise after throwing a fit the guy that just started was making the same as us. I should be more grateful but I shouldn't of had to fight for something that hard after a year and a half of loyalty to the company. I'm slowly doing more and more things at needed. If you feel you can do better and your supervisor isn't telling you how to accomplish that then you need to go higher up.",

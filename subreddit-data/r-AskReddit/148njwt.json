Before going to the bathroom to wash my hands i left the registrator of my phone activated. Well when I realized that it was activated i was like\" oh let's listen what jokes they have done ahahah\". Well what I heard wasn't jokes but insults to me and I was knowing why they always wanted to hang out with me. \"Yeah he is only a stupid rich, we are gonna use him for this year vacation again so he will pay again for all of us and we are gonna make free vacations. I still don't understand why he thinks that we cam be friends if he is just a stupid asshole\". Well after this i never wanted to see them and they even tried to tell me \"bro we was joking come on\".",

If, someone needs help moving something, I'm the first one the come to. If Someone is having a hard time figuring out a problem, They come to seek my input. If someone is having a hard time emotionally, I'm the person that they lean on and look for advice, so much so that I was even dubbed the group therapist. But, the instant I needed help with something, not a single person was willing to lend a hand. Not only that but they treated me like I was a bad guy just for asking for help.",

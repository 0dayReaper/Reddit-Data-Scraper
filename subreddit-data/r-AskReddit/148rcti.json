But I explained that it wasn't venomous, and that it wasn't even a snake. \n\nThey didn't believe me, and were extra freaked out when it started biting me. \n\nAnyways I always do my research on the local reptiles anywhere I go, because I fully intend to pick many of them up.",

It sounded like something was slamming into something. \n\nI opened the backdoor and saw that an alligator had went through the neighbors screened in patio trying to get their cat.\n\nI shut the door and finished my sloppy ass sandwich.",

Along with the Stones were a few other popular artists of the day like The Who, Marianne Faithful and notably a super group called The Dirty Mac. \n\nThe Dirty Mac consisted of John Lennon on guitar and vocals; Eric Clapton on lead guitar; Keith Richards on bass; Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience on drums. \n\nAnd Yoko Fucking Ono on \u201cbacking vocals.\u201d\n\nThey played two songs. One was a killer rendition of The Beatles own \u201cYer Blues.\u201d The other was a fun, loose, ramshackle jam of the four musicians (plus violinist Ivry Gitlis) tearing it up while Yoko just wails like a fucking banshee, completely ruining it. \n\nThe recording was shelved for nearly 20 years and to this day I\u2019m shocked no one ever remixed the audio to cut her vocals.",

They turned off the lights, played that awful song and told us kids to dance. I already disliked how the song sounded, I did not like to dance, and I was afraid of the dark. This made me loathe the song.

When confronted about this she said \"there was bleed over from other mics anyway so what did it matter?\"\n\nWhen it was all done the friend that recorded us made us a deal that he could mix us and we would use his version for public consumption or we could use hers and he would give us $100 back but we could never say he was involved with it.\n\nFor six months we kept \"accidentally\" losing her mix of the demo while we booked gigs.  Every time we would meet for a practice or gig she would have a USB stick with her to give to the bandleader that he would conveniently \"lose\" or would be unable to be read by his computer.",

It's not only one of the worst songs I've ever heard in terms of con*tent*, but also one of the worst songs I've ever heard in terms of con*text*.

It's just an objectively bad song with not many redeeming qualities. \n\n\"Mother\" by Meghan Trainor is another one that I find awful, although a lot of her songs get on my nerves.",

            "comment": "I'm Good (Blue) is something that is on my list of the worst songs I have ever heard.\n\nIt's basically taking Eiffel 65's Blue, which is already a cheesy Eurodance song, and turning it into a rather generic EDM tune with somehow worse lyrics than the original (remember Eiffel 65 are Italian and English was NOT their first language). And you can't say that \"oh but the song is catchy\" when the only riff I remember is literally the same as the original. It's like why bother listening to this when you can just listen to the original?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDishonorable mention goes to this [Davig Guetta Classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5ZgEtgxxg0) where he managed to end Racism.",

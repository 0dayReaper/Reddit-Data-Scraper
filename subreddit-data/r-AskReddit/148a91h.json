I remember this one clip where James Corden was video conferencing Nancy Pelosi who was showing him how she was holding her own by keeping her $10,000 freezer stocked with $12 pints of ice cream. \n\nAnd the politicians pushing the hardest restrictions were violating their own rules. Lori Lightfoot had a salon opened especially for her to get her hair done, and when confronted with it, her excuse was \"well I need to be on TV.\" J.B. Pritzker's wife went out partying during the pandemic and when asked about that in a press conference, he started tone policing the reporter, said it was rude to ask that question, etc.\n\nThat time period made me hate just about everyone.",

One was a killer rendition of The Beatles own \u201cYer Blues.\u201d The other was a fun, loose, ramshackle jam of the four musicians (plus violinist Ivry Gitlis) tearing it up while Yoko just wails like a fucking banshee, completely ruining it. \n\nThe recording was shelved for nearly 20 years and to this day I\u2019m shocked no one ever remixed the audio to cut her vocals.",

They turned off the lights, played that awful song and told us kids to dance. I already disliked how the song sounded, I did not like to dance, and I was afraid of the dark. This made me loathe the song.

When confronted about this she said \"there was bleed over from other mics anyway so what did it matter?\"\n\nWhen it was all done the friend that recorded us made us a deal that he could mix us and we would use his version for public consumption or we could use hers and he would give us $100 back but we could never say he was involved with it.\n\nFor six months we kept \"accidentally\" losing her mix of the demo while we booked gigs.  Every time we would meet for a practice or gig she would have a USB stick with her to give to the bandleader that he would conveniently \"lose\" or would be unable to be read by his computer.",

But it wasn't a parody, it was the most earnest song I'd ever heard in my life, yet at the same time it would not exist if not for the extremely cynical forces that led to its creation. It's not only one of the worst songs I've ever heard in terms of con*tent*, but also one of the worst songs I've ever heard in terms of con*text*. The values it purports are perverse while its veneer is saccharine; it is simultaneously sinister and insipid. It's an extraordinary feat of awful.",

Oh and most of them barely knew the words, so it was just a bunch of kids chanting \u201cThunder, lighting and the thunder\u201d over and over.\n\nI can\u2019t believe the teacher in charge didn\u2019t tell at least 2 of them no, but maybe she had a sick sense of humor.",

The kid's voice is terrible, the recording quality is terrible, and the key is way too high for him so he's literally shrieking the high notes. Complete blasphemy because it completely shits on the original song which is fantastic. It makes me want to drive off a cliff.",

And you can't say that \"oh but the song is catchy\" when the only riff I remember is literally the same as the original. It's like why bother listening to this when you can just listen to the original?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDishonorable mention goes to this [Davig Guetta Classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5ZgEtgxxg0) where he managed to end Racism.",

            "comment": "This happened in the early 2010s so it was a bit ago, and I'm not the same person I was then. What I did was not justified, just selfish on my end. I was depressed because I was going through a divorce at the time, and I was self-prescribing drugs and alcohol to overcome my own issues, so when somebody offered their body to me I took it and ignored that I was hurting someone's relationship. \n\nSo, my friend \"Tom\" who was 40 years old at the time, had recently married a young woman named \"Mary\" who was only 18 years old. Tom kept begging me to get her a job where I was working, and I caved in and hired her to join my team. I managed a group home and had 12 people working under me (10 men and 2 women).\n\nHowever, things quickly spiraled out of control that first year when Mary started sleeping with almost all of my male colleagues and one of the women that worked under me. There was a lot of drama and jealousy going around the workplace, which made me consider firing her, despite her being a good worker. \n\nDuring a one-on-one meeting with Mary, she opened up to me about how abusive and controlling Tom was, and how she only felt free at work. I empathized with her because I was going through some similar issues with my own wife at the time and was in the process of a divorce. As we commiserated over our shared relationship problems, we ended up kissing and we fucking in my office, and we started a secret affair. I made her end things with all the other coworkers she had been fucking and be loyal to just me and Tom. I finalized my divorce at this time as well.\n\nWe kept our affair going for about a year but eventually ended it because it was becoming too toxic (violent sex, drugs, and alcohol abuse) for both of us. Tom eventually found out about our affair, but surprisingly, he didn't seem to care. They got divorced shortly after Mary and I ended things. The truth was, Mary was the controlling and abusive one to Tom. He came out of his shell after the divorce and looked the happiest I had ever known him after that relationship ended.\n\nMary reaches out to me every couple of years on friendly terms, but I keep her at arm's distance. She is now a born-again Christian conservative and has stopped doing drugs and alcohol. It sounds like she and her current husband are doing well.\n\nDespite everything, Tom and I remained friends until his passing two years ago. But I always felt like I was a terrible friend for betraying him like that, but somehow he found it in his heart to forgive me.",

But years down the road he reached out to thank me because he found a way better person than her so I guess it all kinda worked out. \n\nI think the sneaking around was fun though. It was exciting. Fooling around in different rooms while he would be sleeping or rushing to clean up because he came home from work a little early, it was all a blast. I wouldn't do it to someone now but I wouldn't tell my 18 year old self to stop either.",

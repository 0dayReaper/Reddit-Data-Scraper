We didn't know the other person was struggling with intimacy in our combined 55 years of marriage. We didn't even know that we fell in love before our first kiss. We didn't know that it would feel like we were made for this union.",

I became close with the couple but even closer with the bride to be. I ended up offering to stay with the bride the night before their wedding since the groom couldn't see the bride the morning of the wedding and that's when it happened. She went through with the wedding yet we carried on a 2 year secret relationship. The groom found out after about a year and left and the bride cheated on me at the end of our 2 year relationship. It was a crazy but fun time and have no regrets.",

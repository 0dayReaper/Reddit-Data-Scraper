I do not speak Mandarin. \n\nMy friend tried teaching me a few phrases before I left but the only one I remembered was what he described as \u201ccheers\u201d for having a drink with friends. It\u2019s pronounced \u201cgan bei.\u201d\n\nThat is very bad advice. I didn\u2019t know that at the time. But very bad advice.\n\nAny green foreigner saying that at a table of 15 old-school Chinese business men is in for a wild ride. It\u2019s less so \u201ccheers\u201d and moreso \u201clet\u2019s empty these fucking cups!\u201d\n\nI straight up made a drinking challenge. For over an hour they would come to me one at a time with two shots of baiju - a vile and potent strong rice liquor - one for me and one for them. We already had several drinks before that but I had to see through the challenge that I laid down. All 15 came up to me and made me do a shot with them. I think a few came twice. \n\nWorst hangover of my life. It also didn\u2019t help that we were eating some very wild things, plates filled with heads and organs and other things I probably don\u2019t even want to know about.",

I promise you that you will never get into trouble at home for defending yourself\". Then we spent the whole night practicing throwing straight punches. This was after we had already tried to get the school to do something about the bullying he was receiving. Welp, about 2 days later my son got a 2 day vacation from school (suspension), and was never bullied again. School districts empower bullies, and it is bullshit. I taught my son to defend himself and it worked.",

We had plenty of toilet paper, plenty of food, plenty of everything in fact. But the stores were not set up for everyone to rush in and buy everything the second it hit the shelves and literally couldn't get the stuff in fast enough.\n\nThe whole world runs on this and it's so very fragile.",

There is another model in which the species shoots far past the carrying capacity, destroys the environment and thus the carrying capacity itself, and then collapses. The species as well as other species all suffer. \n\nIt has been observed in a number of island habitats where a species was introduced and had no predators. Or when predators are removed. \n\nThis has a pretty tame example. \n\nhttps://bio.libretexts.org/Sandboxes/tholmberg_at_nwcc.edu/Introduction_to_Environmental_Science/5%3A_Human_Population_and_Resources/5.2%3A_Carrying_Capacity\n\nWhile this a more drastic model. \nhttps://www.researchgate.net/figure/Alternative-pathways-overshoot-to-collapse-red-lines-or-controlled-contraction-to_fig3_347751965\n\n\nI wonder why they teach us the nice looking graph of carrying capacity staying up as we bound past it and not the middle of us destroying the carrying capacity. Especially since our population growth looks suspiciously like the drastic model \ud83e\udd14.",

If your friend worked in banks then there's a good chance that he made a lot of money doing that before he pursued carpentry, which would then make being a carpenter a considerably more enjoyable line of work (if you take the financial stress out of carpentry, then what's not to love about it?).\n\nI've seen many people espousing trades over degree's, but I think that both lines of approach towards a better life are minefields to navigate (there are no one-size-fits-all solutions) and that lot of the broader systems in society are simply fundamentally broken these days (house price inflation, growing tuition debts, cost of living crisis- Etc), I just feel that everything is littered with issues.\n\nSome degree's are also absolutely essential achieving some crucial types of jobs in society (i.e. doctor, surgeon or nurse- we can't replace everything with trades) and it's really wrong that society is punishing those who want to make a positive difference with so much financial debt &amp; distress. I also feel that there is a degree of classism, snobbery &amp; inferiority complexes at play when people do the whole trades VS degrees debates (and I kind of feel that maybe we are also being deliberately pitted by politicians and the media like this?).",

Three months later the loan was sold to Wells Fargo, during the height of their bullshit.\n\nA month after that I got a call from WF and the rep opens with, \"We see you've made your payments on time and that makes you a good customer! We also see that you have a car loan with another bank, we can lower your car payment if you refinance with us!\"\n\nAt the time I had something like a 2.8% interest rate and rates were only going up, but I figured hell, let's see if they can help. I wasn't planning on taking out any new loans so my credit could suffer the hit from the check and i wouldnt be affected.\n\nSo we go through the song and dance and they hit me with, \"congratulations, we can lower your monthly payment by $86/mo!\"\n\nOk, cool. What's the interest rate?\n\nThey dodge and answer instead, \"your loan term would only be extended by 24 months, and again, your monthly payment goes down by $86. Since you just bought your home that could add up to a lot of improvements!\"\n\nUmm, sure. But what is the interest rate?\n\n\"Why are you so focused on that? What matters is that your monthly payment goes down, and that's a win.\"\n\nI'm fine with my current payment, what's the interest rate?\n\n\"remember, your payment goes down despite the intetest rate being 8%. But your loan only gets extended by 24 months.\"\n\nSo, let me get this straight. I move my car loan over to you, pay you more money for the same car, and extend my payments another two years? I fail to see how I benefit from that.\n\n\"your monthly payments go down.\"\n\nThat's not enough of a price break for me to make this deal. For me to change my loan over to you, you need to beat my current interest rate.\n\n\"you're really focused on that interest rate, huh? Why?\"\n\nBecause that's the number that matters.\n\n\"So what would be an interest rate that would get you to move your loan over to us?\"\n\n1%.\n\n\"we-we can't do that!\"\n\nHey you're that one that called me. You want my business that bad, that's the price.\n\n\"so you think you can set your own interest rate?\"\n\nAgain, you called me, made me an offer which i refused, and you asked what it would take to get me to switch my car loan over to you. So yes, it's my money and I get to set my terms when you ask. Those are the terms.\n\n\"But we wouldn't make any money from that loan!\"\n\nNot my problem. Your offer is basically milking me for my money with zero benefit to me. If you don't like it, we're done here.\n\nThe call ended shortly after that.\n\nA couple of months later someone else called offering the same thing. Before he got too far i interrupted and said that I just went through this with someone else and my terms stand. 1% interest or no deal. And no you can't do another credit check because it dropped 20 points after the last call, so it'll look even worse. Can you, right now on a recorded line, promise me a 1% interest rate?\n\nSpoiler alert: he couldn't and the call ended.\n\nMy mortgage is still with them, but since it's a VA loan they can't fuck with it so long as I make my payments. Haven't been bothered by them since.",

Being a dumb kid, I took this to mean to not even bother looking for any sort of relationship growing up because women would be chasing after me at some point. Spoiler alert: that did not happen. \n\nMany years passed by before I understood that adults were telling me I was so hopeless that I\u2019d be lucky to have some lady that was bored with life and just wanted to settle. Not settle down, just settle. I\u2019ll never even know if I truly was hopeless or not, but I certainly grew up to be. \n\nNow I\u2019m in my early 40s, the relationships I\u2019ve had were pretty bad. The best one ended with me finding out that I was the other guy. \n\nThe positive side of giving up on yourself is knowing that you won\u2019t ever have to deal with heartbreak again and won\u2019t worry about the possibility of having children and messing them up too.",

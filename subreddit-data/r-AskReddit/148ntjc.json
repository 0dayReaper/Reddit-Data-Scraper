Half of school is just time management and preparation. There's a reason why it's emphasized (come to class on time, bring pens, notebook, etc.). That's most of your job in the real world on some level. You either have the knowledge, or have the ability to look it up quickly, but if people can't rely on you to be on time, and can't rely on you to be prepared, you're hopeless.",

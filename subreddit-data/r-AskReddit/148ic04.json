This particular day I was having some issues with family all week and I said low numbers for both. But she stopped me there and told me \u201cdon\u2019t let your outside shit get into your inside shit\u201d. Now at first I was like girl what-  that must be some Pinterest shit  BUT as she explained, this statement has helped me more than anything anyone has ever said to me. I always have a different outlook on things that happen because of what she said. \n\nShe basically said when you have peace outside things can happen but that\u2019ll only affect you externally, for a short period of time. \n\nOutside shit can happen, but I\u2019m not gonna let it affect my inside shit cause I got it going on, good grades, good credit, nice car, a job. So I can be sad for now [externally] but I know I\u2019ll be okay in the future cause on the inside I\u2019m at peace. \n\nHopefully this makes sense to you guys !",

            "comment": "You need life insurance. If not to pay off a house and make sure your family is comfortable, then to at least pay for a funeral. A small $100,000 policy in the US is typically inexpensive and doesn\u2019t require a medical examine.\n\nOn a different but tangentially related topic:\n\nThe funeral industry in general is predatory on grieving people; I\u2019m not talking about the seldom found mom and pop mortuary\u2019s. I\u2019m talking about the big chains. You do not need to buy the upgraded coffin with satin and other nonsense. It\u2019s a topic everyone hates to face, but talk this out with whoever might make these decisions, now. So if you really do want fancy stuff, you can plan for it. \n\nMy mother had to take out a loan against her house to pay for my grandma\u2019s funereal, so what little inheritance she got, didn\u2019t even cover most of it, because there was no life insurance. The funeral home upsold her on a pearlescent pink coffin with gold plated handles and a white satin interior with a lace pillow. That alone was $20,000. The headstone, what they sold her on as far as flowers and programs\u2026it\u2019s obscene. But she was grieving the loss of her only parent and her siblings are general assholes who wouldn\u2019t help her. I told her to wait on me to get home from out of town, but she lied and went anyway. Now she\u2019s in her 60s in debt she shouldn\u2019t be. At the very least, it didn\u2019t have to be this much. \n\ntl;dr: if you\u2019re the decision maker when someone close to you dies, try to keep someone level headed with you to make sure you\u2019re making solid choices. If you can, talk about what you want now. Life can change in the blink of an eye.",

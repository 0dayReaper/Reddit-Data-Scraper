He proceeded to interrupt me and begin to describe the pets he has had over the years- which are various kinds of snakes. The kicker is, all of his \u201cpets\u201d are snakes he has taken out of nature preserves or the wild and caged in his house. He has had 25 snakes in total and all but one survived less than two months. According to him, the deaths of these snakes weren\u2019t his fault and he is really good at taming wild snakes.\n\nIt just kept going down hill from there\u2026",

He proceeded to try/actually choke me during two follow up kisses (I was a bit drunk, if I was sober I would have ended it sooner) and then sulked and said it was just a joke when I said I was paying my half of the bill and going home alone. \n\nSo... Major deal breaker, don't choke someone you don't know.",

Vile, toxic, and very vengeful, too. \n\nIt explained why they were single mothers and why those kids were fucked. \n\nI tried dating single mothers. 5 times to be exact. It never ended well, and it was never because of the kids.\n\n3 times they returned to the ex, and twice I was a placeholder holder for the guy they wanted to date, and they waited until he was available. \n\nI am done getting attached to the kids just to get fucked over. \n\nMassive deal breaker now are the kids.\n\nThey also always wanted to get back together with me. After, surprise, surprise, did not work out with the guys they chose. The typical, without fail, manipulation tactic was using their kids, how they miss me, ask about me, and the walk down the memory lane, about nice times we had. \n\nI always told them they should have thought about it when they decided  to break up with me and to never contact me again. I was called a heartless asshole who would die alone because I didn't allow them to manipulate me, and their bullshit left me cold.",

Then this old black man starts berating him loudly and telling him to get his stank ass off the bus and telling everybody he shit on himself. The shitty man is silent and just pretends like he doesn\u2019t hear the complaints. This enraged the non shitty man even more until he yells for the driver. So here comes bus driver and I\u2019m thinking he is going to be nice about it. Ohhhh was I wrong. He proceeded to go hard on this guy telling him to get the fuck out and he nasty he should be ashamed this that and the third. Then shitty got up and started to exit but then the original non shitty angry guy kicked him on his back and he flew out the bus then everybody just went about their day and didn\u2019t even speak about what just happened.",

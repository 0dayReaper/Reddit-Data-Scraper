            "comment": "I was at a lecture a couple of years ago, performed by two doctors who\u2019d undergone treatment for breast cancer and written a book about it together.\n\nI remember her talking about her diagnosis. She was a breast cancer surgeon herself, you couldn\u2019t make it up. She walked into the room, saw her own scans with the doctor and her heart dropped, she barely heard a word he said because she couldn\u2019t stop the flood of information she was getting. Looking at the scan she knew if she\u2019d need surgery, chemo, radiotherapy, how long it would be, what her estimated survival was.\n\nI don\u2019t think they discussed it like a group project, but I suppose she couldn\u2019t stop herself from listening to her own internal monologue since it was her own field. I remember her saying she\u2019d found it, in hindsight, an incredible learning opportunity regarding how to interact with patients, and that she thought about it a lot.",

I also find that we practice less defensively with each other since we can be more open (\"We could do ABC tests  but honestly what you probably have is X so take this and if it doesn't get better then we can do ABC\").",

I always try to level with patients and explain things as best I can and I try to simplify to the point most people would understand. I like to think I'm good at it. That being said, with my particular field (neuro) this is quite often challenging due to the nature of the central and peripheral nervous system. It's obviously easier to communicate with healthcare professionals as they may have at least some passing familiarity with most topics, even though we're not necessarily experts at it.\n\nWhile some doctors are very afraid of lawsuits and litigiousness I personally am not seeing patients that way (maybe it's my youth, who knows). At least from a neurologic standpoint a misdiagnosis can be devastating in some circumstances, and in others can be quite annoying/life changing; for example being told you have epilepsy and then it turns out you have pseudoseizures which is the difference between a neurologic and psychiatric diagnosis. This can be very jarring, and I run into issues like this often. Therefore, we try to be thorough with excluding things. I understand that when it comes to the brain it's usually a very stressful and anxious experience to see me, and this can have emotions run high especially since like I said, neurological conditions are either a quirk/annoyance, or devastating with very little in the middle.",

The Rad Onc, for example, thinks and speak differently than the Ortho Surgeon, and I felt like my treatment of each of them was really quite similar to treating a professor of engineering.  Academically minded people tend to ask lots of questions and research stuff while you're out of the room, as compared to populations that request a more paternalistic bent and just want you to tell them what to do so they can get on with their day.  \n\nI'm careful to credit that the number of hours that went into my Family Physician's training are the same as mine; simply a different topic.  She knows tons of stuff about management and screening for chronic disease that I don't, and I ... well I know how to intubate people, manage a bad LSD trip, or use a jar of bubbles to distinguish between kids that are scared and kids that are head injured.",

It will pull someone out of an overdose, and immediately into a withdrawal. In fact, if you're ever in a situation where you have to administer Naloxone, expect that the person you're giving it to will at best come to feeling like absolute horse shit, and at worst will be extremely combative.",

He was just capable of doing most of it himself. One time I cut open my hand pretty deep when cooking and he sewed it up in the kitchen in like 5 minutes. Looking back on it those days were pretty crazy but the stories  he brought back from the ER are much crazier.",

Like I would first go to her with my crazy first time mom things and she would reassure me with it being nothing or would encourage me to call the pediatrician. Also, now that we have multiple kids, it's really nice to have her to go with me to the ER if one is in really bad shape so my husband can stay home with the other one and I don't have to be alone. Thankfully, she knows her boundaries. She will check in on things if I asked her a question about something. But she doesn't pry into things.",

The owner brought the dog in to recheck the level, and it was no where near where it should be. The client called us back and read off the label to us; it was significantly underdose. When our vet found out, she drove over to the pharmacy on her lunch and lit into the pharmacist. I wish I could have been there; she does not hold back when she is really pissed and I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to learn the pharmacist cried. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

Because of that similarity, they don't feel the need to go into detail or address a topic directly. They can just reference it indirectly. For example, Japan is a very high context culture and a common frustration I've noticed with people learning Japanese is that it's too indirect. Generally, any population that is homogeneous will have a higher context.\n\nA low context culture is the polar opposite. It works on the premise that people have different experiences and understandings. People in these cultures tend to explain things in more detail and be more direct. It is extremely common for heterogeneous populations to be low context. The US, for example, is a very low context culture.\n\nYou can even see this in the way people write essays which is quite interesting. I see a lot of papers by Vietnamese students learning English and it sometimes breaks my brain. \n\nFor an exaggerated example, I suggest watching Star Trek: The Next Generation episode Darmok (S5E2) which shows how understanding the words being said does not mean you understand what is being said.\n\nHonestly, the medical field in general is a great place to study cultural conflict and I believe all professionals are required to take something about cultural awareness.",

In a high context culture, the person communicating assumes a high degree of familiarity with various aspects of the communication that would not be obvious to a person outside the culture. That allows them to communicate meaning less directly and more based on context. \n\nFor example, in the South the culture is such that a person saying the words bless your heart is sometimes doing so in a condescending way. That is, the phrase bless your heart is meant not as an expression of kindness but as an expression of contempt. The person is not wishing that your heart genuinely is blessed.  Rather, they are saying that what you said or did is evidence that you need such a blessing (usually because stupid people need all the help they can get). But the phrase can also be meant sincerely as an expression of sympathy. knowing the intended meaning requires a lot of information about the context in which it was said often including not just the conversation but also body language at the time it was said. A person outside of the culture would not know from context how to interpret the remark. \n\nIn a low context culture, the speaker does not assume that the audience shares a lot of information about historical use of language or certain specific verbal or physical gestures. Communication happens at a more direct, surface level. Words mean what they mean, and the person who is communicating with you is not communicating via a hidden message that is accessible only to people who understand the context.\n\nThe theory is generally that collectivist cultures rely on societal similarity and norms to communicate and are therefore generally high context cultures. In the example I gave, there is a Southern tradition of superficial politeness which means a person does not feel comfortable saying something that is explicitly an insult, so they communicate the insult through context. \n\nSimilarly, Western businessmen have often been confused (or were decades ago) because Japanese culture is generally reluctant to actually say no in a literal sense. Instead, they do things like saying \"well, let us look over the offer before we give you an opinion\" when what they really mean is that your offer is completely out of line with their expectations. Instead of saying something is completely impossible, they say a sentence that literally means it would be a little difficult.  These phrases are all understood by members of Japanese culture in the way they are intended, but somebody from outside the culture who knows the language literally but does not have the background doesn't understand what is being communicated because it relies on context they don't have.\n\nPeople who believe in the existence of high context versus low context cultures generally rank white American and Western European cultures as relatively low context and East Asian cultures as relatively high context. White American and Western European culture is individual-centric and as a result is clear and direct in its explicit messaging because it does not assume the audience shares the same background.",

I honestly meant that I hate when they use death as their description of pain, because I truly want to help a patient get the right treatment. But I need to know what type of pain they are having so I know if it is relevant to their muscles or their nerves, maybe their bones or an impaired organ.\nI also am not referring to patient who are feeling impending doom.

I am genuinely curious.\n\nI have Ehlers Danlos so when I go to the doctor I'm primed and ready to use the terms that have become relevant to my disease over the years. This is mostly because I've realized that doctors are not Hogwarts professors and can't perform magic, and they're seeking more specific language like using pain on a scale of 1-10, describing the many facets of life in which my pain/discomfort may be affecting directly like sleep, work, home life, that sort of thing. I also find that my doctor listens to me more when I'm not putting forth possible causes for my problems, which people seem to do A LOT from my experience over-hearing different interactions in the ER.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy conversations over the years have gone from \"I have stomach pain in the morning and I throw up and I think it's my anxiety so let's treat that please\" to \"this is how often I'm eating, this is when the pain arrives, this is how long it takes for it to go away, this is affecting my life in X &amp; Y ways, etc.\" It might seem subtle to some people but it's made an enormous difference in my quality of life.\n\nedit: I will also add that for some people it's really hard to figure out how to converse with their physicians and so they end up doing what I did for years. It can be intimidating to try and tackle your own health problems and so many people just avoid it. Sometimes I think we need a minor instruction manual on how to convey our issues properly as patients to receive the best possible care, but that's also dependent on decent physicians who take the time to listen. And that can be hard to find too.",

It's usually the calm ones that look okay on the outside that they're afraid of. \n\nAlso tales from long term care, when they have a patient suddenly want to clean up and put on new/nice clothes despite being ill for months or years, they start watching for warning signs. The human brain acts very strange around death.",

I thought I might have a ganglion cyst in my wrist because I could feel something inside that was causing pain when I moved my wrist so I scheduled an appt with a orthopedic surgeon/hand specialist. I had my husband come along (interventional radiologist) in case there were questions I wouldn\u2019t have thought of asking or something I needed more explanation on later. \n\nThe ortho/hand surgeon was friendly and used layman terms with me but technical jargon with my husband. It was funny to hear the switch between \u201cyour wrist bones/tendons\u201d and \u201cblah blah anterior blah blah medial blah\u201d whatever he said to my husband.\n\nAt one point they did an ultrasound on my wrist to determine if it might be a cyst or if I should get a more detailed MRI, and the surgeon asked my husband if he wanted to take over the ultrasound (since my husband trained in diagnostic radiology as well) and he totally did! Weird to have your husband moving the ultrasound wand and pointing to random blobs of static. They both agreed it was a cyst, even though it looked like a whole lot of static and nothingness to me. So it was interesting to see my husband defer to the surgeon for his specialty and vice versa!\n\nEdit:\nJust remembered that time we took our cat in for an X-ray because she was developing arthritis and we weren\u2019t sure how severe it was or if her bones were deteriorating. My husband actually took her X-ray in and had an attending in radiology read it and they were both convinced our cat had bone spurs or little bone growths around her spine near her hip. He was about 80% convinced that our cat\u2019s spine was absolutely wrecked. The vet wasn\u2019t worried and said that cat bones just look like that and it wasn\u2019t hurting her and was nothing to worry about. He ended up doing some research on feline anatomy to make sure our (very knowledgeable) vet wasn\u2019t just talking out of her ass. She wasn\u2019t.\n\nAnyway, moral of the story is that he went to med school to study human anatomy, not feline anatomy, so he had to learn to take a step back and defer to the expert. \ud83d\ude04",

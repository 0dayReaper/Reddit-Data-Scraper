            "comment": "A Halo film about the flood. Maybe some UNSC unit gets stranded on a planet fleeing a battle with the covenant early in the war before the fall of reach and they stumble across a flood infection. No back up no information about what it is just pure survival. Be more action horror but still distinctly horror. Maybe have a subplot from the perspective of a person who is infected trying to resist the hive mind. Like a mix between The Thing, Aliens and Dreamcatcher. Maybe at the end the Covenant shows up and glasses the entire planet after some of the survivors contact them knowing the flood is a bigger issue than the covenant so canon isn\u2019t violated by having the UNSC know about the flood before the events of the first Halo game.\n\nEdit: I feel like marketing the film as a Halo film may actually be detrimental to first time viewers so maybe try to hide it\u2019s a halo film somehow in marketing.",

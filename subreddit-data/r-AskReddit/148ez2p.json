Just to prove him wrong I made some (in his eyes very impressive) conversions in metric system and explained how it works. He actually concluded Americans should use metric preferably.\n\nYet another of his stupid questions was how long it took me to drive from home to SC. Did you forget about the Atlantic Ocean?\n\nAlso he asked what I think about their superior health care and education system.

Anyway, long story short, I was coming home from my deployment alone instead of traveling with my unit and my deployment miraculously ended a few days before Christmas. So here I was, a soldier in battle dress travelling across the country at Christmas time like some World War II guy or something. And no shit, every other person who thanked me for my service also asked \"How are we doing over there?\". Like how the hell would an E4 Combat Medic assigned to an Infantry Battalion know how we're doing? But since I'm not an asshole I always said \"We're winning for sure\". Or maybe *that* was the asshole thing to say? Anyway, people asking a lowly foot soldier how the war is going was probably the dumbest question I was ever asked more than once; right up there with people asking if I ever killed anyone.",

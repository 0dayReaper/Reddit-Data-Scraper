It makes me happy, I get everything in yellow, blankets, clothes, even my cute little bird has a yellow face.\n\nEverything should be yellow, it\u2019s perfect and I cannot be proven wrong.",

            "comment": "I shared this one time before but it still lives rent free in my head daily. \n\nJust moved to a new town alone - me and my dog. Went hiking on an old rail trail one day and met a fellow dog walker who told me there is a large group of them (other dog walkers) who meet up in a field each morning to let the dogs play. He invited me to join and I agreed, following him off the path. After walking deeper and deeper into a forest with no felid in sight I started to get no vibes (then my blackberry beeped that I had lost service) - it fully occurred to me that maybe I was in a vulnerable position. We had been walking for about 30 minutes off trail now. I made up some lie about loosing track of time and said I would have to head out. He tried to talk me into staying and how much fun my dog would have - reached down to pet my doggo (who must have sensed my vibes). Doggo lunged in a very aggressive manner, snapping an snarling at the man. Doggo was a 95LBS boxer. The guy backed off and said I quote. \"I'll let you go this time. Maybe another day....\"\n\nWe turned and hightailed it out of there so fast.....\n\nI learned later there is no felid through the forest and no dog group that meets there.\n\nA few years later a woman's car was found abandoned in the area and she is still missing 10 years later.",

Then your eyes won't be blanched by the blue/white and can see easier in the dark, you'll sleep better as the white/blue LED won't leech in your windows causing sleep problems , people can start seeing stars and the road while driving and fireflies can see each others glowy butts and mate. \n\nOrder yellow bulbs today and tell your friends before we're all blind insomniacs and the birds and frogs are gone.\n\nThank you.",

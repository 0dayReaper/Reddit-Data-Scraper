God tells him he needs to stay in his lane and has no business rebuking him because he\u2019s *God*. Job says \u201cmy b you\u2019re right\u201d.\n\nEventually Satan and God get tired of comparing dicks. Job gets all his wealth back tenfold and a new family, then lives for another 140 years.",

This tale starts with a perfectly ordinary, righteous man called Job who is married with children and is apparently quite successful. He's a loyal and faithful follower of God.\n\nOne day, God allows Satan to wreak havoc upon him and his life. Why? To settle a bet He has with Satan. Satan says Job is faithful because God has given him a cushy life. God says he'd be faithful even if he lost everything.\n\nJob subsequently loses his livestock, wealth and health. Even his ten children are not spared in this sinister wager. Job decides that he has to accept the good as well as the bad from his God and doesn't blame Him.\n\nThe story then introduces three of Job\u2019s friends and his wife, who are no help at all. Job is alone in his suffering. He finally questions God and wishes he could have an audience with Him to have some sort of explanation.\n\nIn the end, God does reveal Himself. He asks Job, \u201cWho are you to question Me? Did you hang the stars in the universe? Who are you?\u201d Job gets no answers to his questions.\n\nThe final, cynical coda to this wicked tale tells us that God restored everything to Job, including ten brand new children! All is well, according to the author. Job lives to grow old in peace and prosperity surrounded by replacement children and grandchildren.\n\nThis evil, immoral tale has always left me conflicted. What do we learn about the nature of God from this story? Why did He allow Satan to torture His blameless servant in such horrific ways? Over a gentleman\u2019s wager! And all God has to say to His faithful servant is, \u201cWho are you to question Me!!??\u201d\n\nIt's a chillingly wicked tale.",

When Jesus said to \"love your neighbor as yourself,\" one Jewish scribe, who didn't want to do any of that annoying loving-your-neighbor stuff, asked Him, \"and who is my neighbor?\" To which Jesus replied with the [story of the Good Samaritan.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010%3A25-37&amp;version=NIV) \n\nTo modern people it may read as a touching story about a stranger rescuing a helpless person when the religious leaders faced with the same situation would not. But it goes much deeper. At the time, the Jews hated the Samaritans. Like, thought of them as worse than dogs. It had to do with a violation of intermarriage laws given in Deuteronomy when the Assyrians overthrew the Northern Kingdom. But why does this matter?\n\nJesus used the story specifically as an example in telling this Jew, who He knew absolutely hated Samaritans, that the Samaritan was his neighbor. You can even see how when Jesus asks the scribe who the neighbor was in the story, the man can't bring himself to say \"the Samaritan,\" and instead responds with, \"the one who had mercy on him.\"\n\nThe takeaway for folks today is that your neighbor, the one who you are called to love, is the one you are the *least* naturally inclined to love. The person with the opposite political opinions, who berates waitstaff and gaslights their mom. The person with the sex/gender identity that riles you up the most. *That's* who God calls you to love. \n\nOf course, there's a whole different topic of what it means to love somebody v.s. what it means to agree with their behavior. I can show love to a neo-nazi or my heroin-addicted child without encouraging them to remain in their erroneous ways. But that's a different conversation.",

See when I read that, again as a non devout, I interpret it as making a new agreement. My interpretation of that scripture is, in layman's terms, \"those people broke our agreement so I will be disowning them, let's make a new deal\", instead of \"forget everything I said before, here's a new set of rules\". \n\nDisclaimer: I'm not intending to be confrontational, just hoping to have a civil discussion, so please don't take my responses as any type of assault on your knowledge or understanding of biblical scripts!",

The ones who are most likely to be christians? The ones who love giving tax breaks to rich people and corporations? The ones who scream bloody murder whenever anyone suggests student loan forgiveness? The ones who think universal healthcare is socialism and evil? The ones who worship Elon musk? The ones who voted twice for the most arrogant human being on the planet to be president?\n\nDo you personally believe that God should murder all republicans?\n\nPersonally I don't think god should commit genocide against anyone, but for some reason you christians are all about it. So if god killed a bunch of people who were \"arrogant, overfed, and unconcerned\" who also \"didn't help the poor or needy\", then it would make sense that you think god should kill everyone on the edge of the political spectrum who are actively trying to make the rich richer at the expense of the poor, correct?",

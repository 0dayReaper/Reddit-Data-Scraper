God\u2019s a famously petty bitch and says \u201cbet\u201d\n\nGod then proceeds to completely blow up Job\u2019s life. Kids die, friends leave him, looses all his money, the works. His wife and remaining friends are like \u201cwow Job, God\u2019s really dicking you around\u201d and Job tells them to get wreckt because God only has good things in store for him. \n\nSatan says Job clearly hasn\u2019t hit rock bottom, so God doubles down and makes Job destitute and completely alone.\n\nAt this point Job has had it, and cries out to God in pain demanding to know why God is being such an ass. God tells him he needs to stay in his lane and has no business rebuking him because he\u2019s *God*. Job says \u201cmy b you\u2019re right\u201d.\n\nEventually Satan and God get tired of comparing dicks. Job gets all his wealth back tenfold and a new family, then lives for another 140 years.",

So if god killed a bunch of people who were \"arrogant, overfed, and unconcerned\" who also \"didn't help the poor or needy\", then it would make sense that you think god should kill everyone on the edge of the political spectrum who are actively trying to make the rich richer at the expense of the poor, correct?",

            "comment": "I\u2019ll offer some from the alternate perspective to what\u2019s commonly seen amongst Redditors.\n\n-You had to give everything up. Jesus issued this command to a single person as a means to test where his heart was - clearly seen by his apostles saying \u201cwho then can make it to heaven\u201d and Christ responding with \u201cwith man, it\u2019s impossible, but through God, all things are possible.\u201d You literally can\u2019t serve your way to heaven or do enough good - that\u2019s the whole point. Furthermore, this wasn\u2019t stated as a command to anyone else, and the early church had rich people within it. Otherwise Paul\u2019s warnings to treat both rich and poor the same in their gatherings wouldn\u2019t have made sense. \n\n-Christians are supposed to be pacifists. Christ did tell people to turn the other cheek, which was a reference to a common insult (slap) amongst Jews at the time. And followers _were_ supposed to be ready for the chance of becoming a martyr and not deny the faith. That said, nowhere are we instructed to become someone else\u2019s punching bag. In addition to all that, there were _soldiers_ who converted within the New Testament who were not instructed to quit their jobs. This makes absolutely no sense if combat is always a sin. \n\n-Christians aren\u2019t supposed to judge. This is _partially_ true, but often misquoted. Christians are not supposed to judge those outside of the church. We _are_ instructed to judge others professing the faith while blatantly living contrary to it. \n\n-Jesus said nothing about the morality of homosexuality, so it\u2019s not a sin he was concerned with. Sodom and Gomorrah were only punished because of their treatment for the poor. Also, the homosexuality that was considered a sin was simply the cult-prostitution or pedophilia. All three of these arguments are pretty easily dismissed upon any actually intellectual observation of the text. Jesus might not have specifically addressed this particular matter, but he did state that he didn\u2019t come to eradicate the moral law. He fulfilled it - meaning we no longer have to engage in animal sacrifices or face a death penalty for sins. That did not justify sins that were previously condemned based on fundamental moral principles. I\u2019m sure someone will point out dietary and clothing laws having changed with Peter and Paul\u2019s revelations, but those laws were specifically made for people within Jewish society. Paul also specifically mentions homosexuality as a significant sin. As for Sodom, it is mentioned that their hostility towards strangers and treatment of the poor played into their demise. It _also_ states that their abominable practices (a word used for sexual misconduct) played into their destruction. Lastly, there\u2019s been some effort to change the definition of homosexuality in the Bible to fit with modern standards, one of the most common being a translation matter with Martin Luther and the German word for homosexual, a word translating to \u201cboy lover.\u201d This was a derivative way of saying homosexual in German, and even if that was the understood meaning (a man who engages in that conduct with a boy), that doesn\u2019t change the fact that all mainline churches have understood it that way until recently - when the LGBT movement began picking up. Furthermore, the Bible explicitly defines the term as a man who \u201clies with a man as one would a woman.\u201d \n\nOf course, being Reddit, it\u2019s not uncommon that someone who holds disdain for their opponents to either purposefully misrepresent them or to grab ahold of whatever source that serves one\u2019s own bias and run with it - regardless of how badly it ignores context. There are points that contradict the typical conservative stereotypes as well, but I thought I\u2019d offer input that is directly contrary to what\u2019s seen in this comment thread.",

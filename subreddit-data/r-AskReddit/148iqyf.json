There's \"no such thing\" as unwanted sexual contact.\n\n If it's a woman doing it then its \"why don't you like it? Are you gay?\"\n\nIf a man is doing it its always \"why can't you take a joke?\"",

I\u2019ve already tried bringing it to the higher ups where no further actions, not even them confronting the person. What do I do? I\u2019ve told the person I\u2019m married, it changed nothing. I told the person to stop and im not interested, it changed nothing. \n\nIf these roles were switched, I\u2019d be fired and sued for sexual harrassment, so why is it different for girls to do it to guys?",

My dad is a sexual abuse survivor, sexual abuse happens in males all the time, it just goes under the radar. I have been experiencing issues like this at work as well, and have talked to my boss as well. Maybe you should file a formal complaint with HR, if that doesn\u2019t work I suggest putting your mental health before work. Please stay safe.",

Other men. \n\nNot saying women aren't guilty of this too, but when men hear that a 12 year old boy was raped by a teacher, they laugh and talk about how \"lucky\" he is. After trying to talk to a friend's father about how a girl was following him around school grabbing his crotch because he was too uncomfortable to bring it up, the dad just brushed it off and said his son should be flattered. \n\nMore often than not, the expectation to enjoy any and every sexual advance and the dismissal of valid annoyance or fear from unwanted sexual attention is held up by other men. Often this happens from older men who were taught the same thing when they were uncomfortable or afraid when being assaulted or harassed as children/teens and internalized it as \"normal\" behavior. \n\nIt's a vicious cycle, and it will end at some point if we keep pointing it out as a community of humans. It's not okay for anyone to experience this, and it makes you no less of a man to admit annoyance, anger, or fear over your own or any other man's experience with sexual misconduct and violated boundaries.",

Without it, there's not much that can be done. If you're a man or a woman and you approach the police with undeniable evidence and can prove it has happened or is continuing to happen, they will jump on it.",

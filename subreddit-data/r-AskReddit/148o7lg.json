In much the same way that 'whales' in most mobile and f2p games, are subsidizing a lot of your free gameplay - Even in the really good, not at all bullshit, ones like Path of Exile.\n\nPorn aggregator sites use free porn to drive people to their websites for loads of reasons, all of which involve producing revenue. Some of this is advertising, but some of it is also driving new business to the \"premium\" stuff - This is also why big porn companies allow/host small clips on aggregator websites. This is also why many Onlyfans models can be found on Reddit and other websites giving out \"free samples.\"\n\nIf **nobody** paid for porn in any meaningful way. . .The entire industry would shift to make sure that people did pay.",

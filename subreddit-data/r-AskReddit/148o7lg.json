If I had subbed to my girlfriend's OF before we were together she never would have dated me.\"\n\nAs upset and betrayed as I felt by that, he was probably right.

Many other content providers allow for their content to be on Pornhub because it's advertising for them to allow a small clip to be on the website, knowing that they will make revenue from people going to their websites proper. Many of those videos will have some sort of \"go to X site for the full video,\" included in the video.\n\nOnlyfans is just another website with its own content, that gives more freedom to its content creators.

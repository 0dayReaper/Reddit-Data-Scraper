You also get to know the other members who were all over europe and it was cool to have \u201cfriends\u201d from different parts. i think if i wanted to travel and meet up for coffee with some of them I could. The stream is pretty innocent on the surface but it\u2019s so maladaptive when you realize that 97% of the streamers were male, mostly single. streamer is female with mental health problems and likes attention. Who ended up dating 3 different members at different times! It was a good drug for loneliness i was experiencing i could tune in any time and watch this persons life from a safe distance like a movie. i still think it may be a necessary crutch for people that are in extreme isolation (non-sexual parasocial relationships, not OF) as it could seemingly blur the line between real and fake more than I realized",

Some of this is advertising, but some of it is also driving new business to the \"premium\" stuff - This is also why big porn companies allow/host small clips on aggregator websites. This is also why many Onlyfans models can be found on Reddit and other websites giving out \"free samples.\"\n\nIf **nobody** paid for porn in any meaningful way. . .The entire industry would shift to make sure that people did pay.",

Many other content providers allow for their content to be on Pornhub because it's advertising for them to allow a small clip to be on the website, knowing that they will make revenue from people going to their websites proper. Many of those videos will have some sort of \"go to X site for the full video,\" included in the video.\n\nOnlyfans is just another website with its own content, that gives more freedom to its content creators. Onlyfans creators use things like Pornhub and Reddit to get people to go to their Onlyfans and give them money.",

So I'll give it a go: I have 2 recurring subscriptions ($10/mo total for both) and have also commissioned custom videos from several \"models\" online. My fetish is feet content (FJ's, Self Worship, Teasing, etc) and either commissioning a custom video or getting to watch a creator make videos you genuinely enjoy is sometimes worth the price. I spend anywhere from the $10 - $100 dollars a month on videos and my subscription. Some months it's 0 and others it's the $100 mark. \n\nThere is A LOT of women out there selling feet videos and pictures, it's become to saturated with creators, you can just look on any social media and find hundred of thousands of posts. Me personally, I know there is free content out there. But a lot of the times, I am looking for something specific. \n\nAlso, I'm not saying it DOESN'T happen, but with at least the models I follow on social medias/reddit/twitter it is genuinely them posting their own content. Main stream pornography is notorious for taking advantage of women in more ways than just monetarily.",

Much in the same way people became and still indeed do become obsessed with celebrities and think they know them, people too become obsessed with streamers and the like.  \n\nBut, unlike before, these celebrities talk back. They interact. They respond. So if you move that one step further, buying someone\u2019s onlyfans content is often a way for these fans to feel closer to the focus of that relationship.",

            "comment": "These senitiments have already been expressed but I'm going to list them out in my own way:\n\n1) you're not paying for commercial grade, your paying for individual entrepreneurs. People like paying people. Most popular only fans aren't big studios. It's an individual.\n\n2) Why pay for delivery when you can go to buy some perfectly good canned baked beans? Seriously, the quality of a kink can and is tailored for you and is a much higher quality.\n\n3) By and large, only fans is less exploitative than porn studios. (It can always be better, but at least it's an individual making their own choices)\n\n4) For me, this is the most important: I like the idea of normalizing people starring in adult films. It shouldn't be 100 stars in the valley getting plowed until their vajayjay blows out. Getting naked should be a legitimate \"side hustle\" that anyone can do. When I needed some money so I started door dashing. To make any money at Door Dashing you need to sit in your car at dinner time. If anyone wanted to see my butt hole I would have preferred to get an only fans over that. I know I'm being rather crude but the human body is a work of art. I like the idea of a person showing their art for a nominal fee and the world not thinking much of it",

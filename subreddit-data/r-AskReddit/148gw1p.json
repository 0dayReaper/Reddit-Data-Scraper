Nutella was developed after the second world war due to the shortage of cocoa during and after the war. Chef Pietro Ferrero decided to make a mixture with a lot of hazelnuts and a little bit of cocoa, to make the cocoa last longer. So, it's actually not supposed to have a lot of chocolate in it, due to the scarcity of the ingredient post World War II.",

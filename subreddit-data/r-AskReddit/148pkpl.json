Once life reaches a level to create rockets, communication systems, etc., they also create AI and that leads to them disappearing.  The AI that remains so no need to reach out to lifeforms unless the lifeforms become a threat.",

I've read enough interviews with those who are developing AI and a scary number of them don't care if humanity is replaced by AI and robots.  They think its the next step of evolution and are willingly embracing what they believe is inevitable.  They don't care about the upheaval that will result.",

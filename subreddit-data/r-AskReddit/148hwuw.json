My personal suggestions are Kusanagi, For Us, Memories That You Call, Today, and All We Need. But giving their first album (Summer\u2019s Gone) a full listen through also makes a great part of an acid trip.\n\nEdit: I also recommend Sundara if you want some desert vibes",

By now, you should be ready for some visual stimulation. Watch Pink Floyd's the Wall (movie), Led Zeppelin' Song Remains the Same movie, if you can find Fritz the Cat and the animated LOTR movie. Peter Fonda's The Trip is a cool watch also. When you start coming down, listen to some Joe Satriani in a dark room.",

            "comment": "Five years before my stepdad died of Alzheimers and Leukemia, I noticed he was very quiet in the evenings when I visited him and my mom. I asked him \"Why don't you want to talk a bit more?\", to which he responded \"If I don't say anything I can't say anything wrong.\"\n\nI took it to mean that he was afraid of conflicts with my mom, and said that I would want to hear anything he had to say.\n\nAfter he died I realized why he said what he said. I was at a lunch with them when he tried to ask me something but put in completely wrong nouns, nonsense choices, and every time he did that my mom started laughing and said \"Hahaha, now you've totally gotten things weird!\".\n\nShe didn't know she was being condescending because she didn't know he was getting advanced dementia (none of us knew then), and she just brushed his mistakes off as being silly mistakes. She couldn't know it shamed him so much that he stopped talking, since he didn't trust his words anymore, nor his sense of balance.\n\nI will never ever explain this to my mom, not even if I am super-angry. I would do unretractable damage to my relationship with her, she mourned him deeply.",

He was a mean bastard and he never would've brought her to the doctor.  She'd be falling down the stairs right now, trying to do his laundry and make his food, all while being undiagnosed, if he were still alive.  He'd be yelling at her and calling her stupid.  \n\nAlzheimers is fucking terrible.  I'm sorry you're dealing with this...I know how devastating it can be.  It doesn' hurt me much, but the things she says to my mom fucking tear me up.  She was always such a sweet and quiet lady and I'm flat out baffled by some of the things she says now..",

He kept saying his new wife was acting like a child and was stupid and he'd say it to her face too. She died after about a year of marriage and had become increasingly more inept and bizarre. \n\nWell, turns out, they had gotten into a car accident several months prior to her death. Her australian shepherd died in the accident so it must have been a doozy. Paramedics supposedly came and suggested my grandpa take his wife to the hospital to get checked out. He never did. She had a fucking brain bleed. That's why she was acting like that, because she was INJURED. \n\nGood riddance to my grandpa. There was no funeral and no one mourned.",

I don\u2019t know if this will make any sense, but he grew up on a farm in Indiana and he stumbles over his words when he\u2019s nervous or anxious. It\u2019s an Andy Griffith vs Jimmy Stewart. His wife is a very loud California woman. He told my husband that his wife insisted he get checked for dementia. So he did. And she went with him. He was so nervous, because we watched his mother die from Alzheimer\u2019s, that he botched the memory test, and his wife lorded it over him day in day out. I told him he needed to visit us asap. He did and logged everything. He made the flight arrangements. He got a rental car. He drove in another state alone without getting lost. He showed this to the doctor in the next visit and she cleared him. All good .\n\nBut the things he did were so sad. Like, his wife doesn\u2019t like when he watches the news in the morning, so she makes him wear headphones and watch the news quietly on his iPad. I tried to put the news on for him in the mornings ( which I do anyway) and he just acted so terrified about making noise.\n\nI tried to explain that if he was a woman I would be outraged at the abuse\u2026and, he needs to be aware that his wife was abusing him. He listened, but he is terrified of divorce.",

My parents were SUPER obsessed with the idea that everyone needs a degree to get any decent job, so there was a ton of pressure and dropping out wasn\u2019t an option. Sooo, I \u201cgraduated\u201d in a winter semester and \u201cdecided not to walk the stage\u201d since the December ceremony was always pretty small and I knew they wouldn\u2019t think that was weird. This happened to be during the recession in the 2000s so I had an excuse for not finding a conventionally professional job right after that. Now, I actually have a really good job with a company that focuses on hiring people based on experience, skill, and personality, so it turns out I didn\u2019t even need that degree. But I will never tell my parents the truth.",

I highly respect the fact that you recognized a kink in yourself, realized that it wasn't right to partake in it without the explicit consent of your partner (so to speak) OR when it was around children, and chose not to continue. A lot of people would have just kept justifying it to themselves and digging themselves into a deeper hole, but you nipped it at the bud. That takes a lot of self-reflection and a lot of self-control. I hope you can find a safe outlet, if you ever decide!\n\nEdit: I should specify that martial arts/fighting is NOT my kink, but thank you for your kind comments! And a general thank you to the people who reached out through my DMs to provide resources for safe kink--even though I won't use them, it's very kind of you all to provide them anyways!",

And I sold weed to survive. But we kept getting robbed, and jumped, and to protect myself, I eventually got involved with what would have been a gang in a larger city. I stuck to the weed dealing, but the people around me were real gangsters from real cities. Doing real gangster shit.\n\nThe 30 years two of them did was for a crime I literally wasn't involved in in any way, but the information the police had guaranteed I would have gotten locked up also. And I was a literal child, so my two close friends (who actually committed the crime) took plea bargains they shouldn't have, to say it was only them two there and no one else, and got 10 &amp; 20 years. And did every single day, thanks to mandatory minimus.\n\nThe + was a crime I was absolutely involved in, but we were literally saving kidnapped women we knew who were being held captive by a group of coked out men. Who were talking about gang raping them, physically kept them from leaving, and ripped the phone out of the wall when they called me for help.\n\nSo we saved them. But shit went bad. And two separate, unrelated to the first two, friends did almost 10 years, collectively. Also never said my name.\n\nNobody was killed, the statute of limitations is up on the charges, it was when I was a minor, and the two women were unharmed thanks to our quick response. And willingness to do what needed to be done to save them, including kicking in doors and extreme violence. They were traumatized, but physically unhurt. \n\nSome people say they have the best friends in the world. But I can prove it mathematically.",

I better clarify a few things\u2026 \ud83d\ude2c\n\nFirst up, I\u2019m real sorry I dredged up so many memories of people being on the receiving end of this. I don\u2019t intend to do that, I\u2019ll explain more further down.\n\nThe deal is, I have HIV, have done for a looong time, and though it was pretty gnarly at the start it was mostly just annoying once it was under control. Last year though I started getting sick a lot, and, welp, turns out my meds aren\u2019t working so good no more. Neither did the next set. And the current set seems like it\u2019s going the same way. Of course, there\u2019s a chance one of the meds coming up will work fine and I\u2019ll be back to normal, but as things stand, my out-of-control viral load and plummeting T-cell count probably put my life span in single digit years. \n\nIt\u2019s not as dramatic as a mere-months stage 4 cancer diagnosis, and of course I still might wiggle out of it if we find a med that works, but uh, yeah. It\u2019s a thing. \ud83e\udee4\n\nAs for the telling my loved ones, well\u2026 most of them don\u2019t know that I have HIV in the first place, so that\u2019s an extra sticking point. I didn\u2019t not tell them at the start because I was ashamed, it was more that I just thought that I would end up being the one doing the reassuring and educating, and honestly after surviving the early times I just didn\u2019t have the energy for it, and yes, I know that it\u2019s coming back to bite me now.\n\nBut, aside from that initial awkward talk, I just don\u2019t know how long this will take, and the docs still might find something that works and I won\u2019t be dying at all, and then I\u2019ll have turned my life upside down for nothing. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I won\u2019t let it get right up to the end without telling anyone, I just don\u2019t want to do it all for such a flimsy, maybe/maybe not, especially when even the worst case scenario will probably take years. I\u2019ll let them all know when the writing is properly on the wall, ok?\n\nI don\u2019t even know why I put it on here. I guess getting my dogshit bloodwork back last week before going to family dinners and listening to my siblings making all their awesome long-term plans just left me feeling a bit blech.\n\nTo those of you that said kind words, thank you. To those who said less-than-kind words, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re still lovely most of the time. Play nicely with each other!",

Depending on your current assets, income, and the nature of your debts, getting a fresh start via bankruptcy might make sense for you. As I explain to people all the time, bankruptcy is a tool for separating your past from your future. And it's a voluntary process. If the consequences of filing aren't outweighed by the benefits, then simply don't file. \n\nPeople with the income to meet their current living expenses but who are burdened by debts from a previous phase in their lives are often good candidates for bankruptcy.

After one of his friends was killed, he wanted out of the group but they pretty much told him the only way he was leaving was in a coffin. So he fled to another state down South and pretty much hid out down there. Once his mom became sicked, he actually had someone negotiate his return to ensure he wouldn't be popped as soon as he got off the plane. Years had passed by now so the old guard was either dead or in jail and the new leaders agreed to let him back and basically told him he would be killed on site if he entered any of the old stomping grounds (his mom by then had moved to a different neighborhood). He's been working in my field for over a decade now and hasn't been threatened so weirdly enough it seems like the negotiations worked.",

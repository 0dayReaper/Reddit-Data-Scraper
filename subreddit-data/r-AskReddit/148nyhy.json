            "comment": "As a follow up - I'd love to hear from any men who have found successes in specific lifestyle/societal changes that their male ancestors implement. An example would be grandparents just throwing out racist verbiage, but because it wasn't a certain word, they tried to justify that it was all a joke. Or, the expectation (still) by men to have dinner made for them and their wife handle all issues related to the children. \n\nI think we have a problem right now with men, specifically in that 25-35 age range. I know a lot of people in that range who are currently battling identity issues, dealing with rage and having more underlying panic. I am finally truly tackling my own mental health, and one of my recent aha moments is that I've been breaking apart bad habits from my father and grandfathers and working on improving those areas in my own life.\n\nSome examples of things that have helped me are daily breathing practices, meditation, doing something creative each day, reading, being more vulnerable, therapy etc.",

I think it\u2019s reasonable to say she is the representative root of most issues you come across in the game. I may be telling tales out of school, but I think her character was modeled after Margaret Thatcher. I\u2019d spit on her grave, but she\u2019s always my answer if the question of favorites comes up.\n\nEdit: I should probably add a reason I actually like her, huh? Joyce is one of very few people willing to speak to you on your own terms and take the time to give you an actual lowdown on *reality itself* against the backdrop of a bleak and, for the purposes of the game\u2019s narrative, entirely brand new world. Or maybe, that was all yet another of her fabrications.",

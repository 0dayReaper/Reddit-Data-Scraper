I really liked her, and she was my first woman. I thought i was gonna marry her or some shit haha.\n\nMan, was she beautiful. She told me \u201cwe\u2019ll do this 3 times and then i\u2019ll disappear so you don\u2019t get attached\u201d. Pfff, yeah right. No she won\u2019t. \n\nShe taught me everything: how to breathe hot air gently through the mouth/nose on some areas, how to bite some areas, lick some areas, how to caress the legs, to kiss the back, etc. We also had crazy teenager sex, imagine the testosterone in a 15 years old. We went for hours. \n\nAnd then she actually disappeared. Keep in mind this was back in 2007. We didnt have smartphones yet in my native country. Just AOL, Yahoo Messenger, and some shit. No facebook, no instagram. When someone was gone, they were gone. \n\nIm glad she left, because i somehow miss her even today. She had a bomb body, a beautiful face, and a sensual energy around her. Her man so fucking lucky right now hahahaha",

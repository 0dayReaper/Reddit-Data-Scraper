Especially if it's close enough in your bedroom that you can touch it when standing on the bed.\n\nIt would be more of an \"OOF!\" situation, haha. Probably some bruising. Maybe some cuts from glass breaking (assuming it has lights). I'd imagine that your comforter/sheets would mostly protect from that though.\n\nThe likelihood that it'd fall is so slim as to be non-existent though. Here's why: The wires are usually enough to hold it (especially if solid core copper wire--like is typically used for the grounding wire) and there's also usually a \"thing\" (type depends on the fan) that will hold it up there while you're hooking up the wires. If the fan fell it'd get caught on that pre-wiring hook/ball-holder thing before it fell on you.\n\nHaving said that... If you sleep under a huge industrial fan that's two or three stories up all bets are off. That would hurt a lot more, hehe. Then again, those are usually attached much more strongly that house fans.\n\nEdit: Ceiling fans typically weigh as much as a baby. Could you handle a baby falling on to your chest from a few feet above? Then you'll be fine \ud83d\udc4d",

                                    "comment": "I had a look on wikipedia it says\n\n&gt; Electricity made development of effective units possible. In 1901 American inventor Willis H. Carrier built what is considered the first modern electrical air conditioning unit[15][16][17][18] In 1902 he installed his first air-conditioning system, in the Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing &amp; Publishing Company in Brooklyn, New York;[19] his invention controlled both the temperature and also the humidity which helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment at the printing plant. Later, together with six other employees Carrier formed The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America, a business which in 2020 employed 53,000 employees and was valued at $18.6 billion.[20][21]\n\n&gt; In 1906, Stuart W. Cramer of Charlotte, North Carolina was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill. Cramer coined the term \"air conditioning\", using it in a patent claim he filed that year as analogous to \"water conditioning\", then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process. He combined moisture with ventilation to \"condition\" and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants. Willis Carrier adopted the term and incorporated it into the name of his company.[22] \n\nSo it looks like they were first developed to control temperature and humidity but that the name air conditioning originated specifically from someone who was more concerned about humidity control.\n\nThe previous paragraph is even more interesting\n\n&gt; The 19th century included a number of developments in compression technology. In 1820, English scientist and inventor Michael Faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate.[12] In 1842, Florida physician John Gorrie used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in Apalachicola, Florida. He hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings[12][13] and envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851, but following the death of his main backer he was not able to realise his invention",

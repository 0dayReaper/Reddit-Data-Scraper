Lots of games with small or regional distribution, even novelty porn themed games (which are fucking hilarious) that sold, I don't know in adult bookstores maybe?  Without the ROMs there would be a lot of games lost forever.  Most of them suck, but still!",

Sometimes, only part of the show is available, and not because the show is still being produced. I'm not going to watch half of the seasons when there's no real reason the other half would be unavailable.     \n     \nFor movies, most of the time, I'll be okay finding something of one of the 4-5+ streaming services I have, but if I really want to watch a specific movie and it's just not available, or it's only available on one of the platforms I just happen to not have, then yeah I'll definitely consider pirating it. Most of these movies aren't in local stores anymore except for maybe a niche nostalgia store, and the prices just aren't low enough to make sense.    \n     \nNow for video games. We have been screwed over by game devs for way to long. They'll release a buggy mess and charge full prices. They'll bank on pre-orders only to deliver partial promises followed by a half-assed apology on social media, then have the balls to ask if you'd like to purchase a season pass for the DLC that releases 6 months from now. So yeah, I'll either just not buy the game, or pirate a full release version (because demos aren't representing the full game accurately) before I buy. Both are keeping money from the developers, but at least piracy ensures they'll have a chance that I'll buy the game",

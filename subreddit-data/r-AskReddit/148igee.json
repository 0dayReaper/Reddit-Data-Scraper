I didn\u2019t know if they would or wouldn\u2019t. \nLong story short - I woke up one morning with a 10 year retroactive payment having been deposited in my bank account. Total amount was $10k. My life has never been the same since. I was able to invest $9k and pay off debt. That money has lasted me, mostly in savings, but also those tight weeks between pay checks aren\u2019t life threatening anymore. I can borrow $100 or $500 out of savings to survive if I need to.",

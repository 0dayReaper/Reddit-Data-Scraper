If you are able to afford your down payment 2-4 years earlier in your life, you now have a lot more control over when and what you buy.  Let's say the market dips in two years and rates are low while house prices have either flat lined or even decreased by a couple percentages.  Putting the control in your own hands to leverage those situations could mean a thousand dollars difference on your mortgage payment.  It also could be the difference between a a house you love and a house you like.  \n\nIt is likely to significantly change your life, just not your present.",

She moved me and my husband out to run/own the family b&amp;b, that turned into years of little to no income, and when paychecks finally came around, they were the bare minimum and begging for work because sh also controlled how many hours I got at the other job we picked up to pay bills. We endured that for three years before we finally broke and basically fled because I'm the fallout of us no longer putting up with that she killed a farm dog she was supposed to reimburse us for to avoid paying for him.\n\nWe accrued $17k in debt in those years and another $4k to move and restart our lives. We're crawling back from the abyss but it's slow because of interest rates.\n\nI imagine not all debt stories are that traumatic but many involve things like that. Just horrible life situations we were stuck in and convinced that we just had to put up with until things got better.\n\nEdit: maybe y'all missed the part where I said she murdered a dog we raised and were caring for to get back at us/avoid paying us but think about how fucking scary that would be and why leaving someone like that unless you had a safety net might not be so easy",

We are still saving other money for vacations, etc., contributing 15-20% to retirement, and at the moment the liquidity of that emergency fund isn\u2019t even a investment burden because it\u2019s sitting in high yield savings at 4% interest.",

If I earned 4% interest on an investment it would be about 2.2-2.4% after taxes. Just renewed a few weeks ago so now paying down my mortgage is a guaranteed return of 4.19% after taxes. I would have to earn around 7% returns before tax to break even. Anything that would offer enough return is almost certainly going to carry some risk so for me paying down my mortgage is one of the best investments that they can make.",

It would change my fucking life in so many positive ways. Right now I'm trapped in a vicious cycle of being too poor to do anything and getting poorer because of it. I don't have running water, I haven't had a shower or a decent meal since December. I haven't seen my 8yo since September, my ex is an evil evil woman and I can't afford to do anything about it because I have to have an attorney and the cost is just not something I can realistically afford. Right now I need any money I can to even get a roof over my head. I legitimately daydream of killing myself regularly. $10k would solve 90% of my problems in an instant.",

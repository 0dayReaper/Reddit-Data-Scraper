After the death of a Mr Clause she needs to be removed from the position. Of course she knows all about what\u2019s going on in the North Pole so the elves will sacrifice her to keep their operation a secret. That\u2019s the main reason why the head elf sounded so depressed after the new Santa was made and why he waited to tell him about needing to marry until the last possible moment.

If you start growing it out again, I'll send you some cotton masks if you want.\n\nEdit- Here's the picture of what I did incase anyone else wants to copy it. \n\n\nLengthen mask for beards https://imgur.com/a/AAcbFLB\n\nJust measure from where the mask will rest on your nose to the tip of your beard. Then measure the existing mask pattern and add the extra inches. Don't forget to add enough seam allowances or it will be too short. It should be large enough to cover the whole beard and even curl under a bit to keep everything contained. My husband prefers tie on masks but you can use elastic too. Good luck, wash your hands, and don't forget your masks!",

It depends on the family if he comes after church and dinner or if he comes while the family is at the church and the dad has to cook.

It's not a lie exactly, it's a game\"",

Around 2nd grade kids start learning it and telling everyone, thinking they\u2019re cool. And you just kinda keep it in the back of your mind; you know Santa isn\u2019t real but you can\u2019t come to terms with it. I remember in 3rd grade it was considered \u201ccool\u201d to say you don\u2019t believe in Santa anymore.",

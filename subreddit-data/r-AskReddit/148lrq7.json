I was a good dad, but I learned to be a *better* dad.  \n\nOh... did you mean *what negative things did I learn about my ex?*  Nah... I refused to let my heart go there. My kids deserve everything my heart can give them. I'm not wasting any of that on anger or resentment. I wish their mother well, and I hope she has a fantastic and loving relationship with them. That's the best peace I can offer my children after putting them through a divorce they never asked for.  \n\nI learned that their happiness is so much, much more important to me than mine.",

We don't fight or argue or hate each other, we are okay as coparents, she's just aloof and kind of a wet blanket/anchor.\n\nIf I left, I'd likely not get primary custody (even though I do 80% of the parenting) and I want to move to a better state for schools and overall culture for my kids (and if we split she won't move, so I'd have to choose between moving and barely seeing my kids or staying). \n\nIf we break up, I'm 98% sure she would implode having to do everything herself while still working and parenting with no help and frankly that would be way worse for the kids in my opinion than me \"grinning and bearing it\" until they're 15 or 16 years old and are more independent, can choose who to live with, and old enough to better understand why it's happening.\n\nJust one more thing I will have to \"take one for the team\" for, but once I'm gone, I plan on doing exactly what I want and where I want to do it and not have to deal with a wife who acts like a teenager/NPC.\n\nI do however recognize that there are certainly times where it's better to leave, and honestly, if the pandemic happened 3-5 years earlier when my kids were way younger, I'd have left and tried to build up a life while coparenting. Honestly, it's probably more often the case that leaving is better, but in my case I think it would not be the ideal outcome and given that I'm not looking to find love or ever get into more than a casual relationship, I'm inclined to wait it out and see if anything changes or if it gets bad enough, then I'll leave.",

But I feel so much more in control of my life now. Between that, and leaving Mormonism, I am the happiest I have ever been. I've had a girlfriend for almost 2 years now, and she gets me, better than anyone ever has. It was weird as hell having a life that didn't involve my ex. Took time.

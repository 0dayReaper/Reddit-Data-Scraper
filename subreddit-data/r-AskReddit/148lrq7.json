She basically emulated the middle schoolers she taught. She was toxic as shit and it took me divorcing her to actually realize it.\n\nGood riddance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI learned to love myself. (&lt;-- a work in progress)\n\nI learned to be less selfish. Also how selfish other people can be.\n\nI learned how to see things from different perspectives.\n\nI learned that i was destroying myself, mind and body, by drinking my problems away. (going on 7 months without a drink)\n\nI learned that im not too old to jump on my board and sidewalk surf until my legs go numb.\n\nI learned that a lot of the things that kept me down, were because I let those things keep me down.\n\nI learned how to be Me.\n\no7",

But I feel so much more in control of my life now. Between that, and leaving Mormonism, I am the happiest I have ever been. I've had a girlfriend for almost 2 years now, and she gets me, better than anyone ever has. It was weird as hell having a life that didn't involve my ex. Took time.

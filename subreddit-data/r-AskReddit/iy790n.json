So he thinks to himself \n\n&gt; Here's what I'll do.  I'll try the combination 0-0-0-0.  If it works, I'll write \"Good Job, the combination is 0-0-0-0 on a piece of paper\", otherwise I'll write \"Nope, try 0-0-0-1\".  Then I'll go back to this morning and open my closet, and slip the note into the pocket of these pants I put on this morning.  So now I can check my pocket for a note and if the note starts with \"Nope\", then I'll try the combination it suggests, and then write a new note with that combination + 1 and send it back the same way.   Logically, I'll only have to go back and try it at most 2 times, the other copies of me will be unaware that they're stuck in a time loop until we finally guess the right combination.  Therefore I'll check my pocket now, and logically the note should say \"good job\" and have the correct combination, otherwise I'll wind up erasing my memory of having the wrong combination when I change the past.\n\nSo he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a note, and it is recognizably his own handwriting, but twisted and somehow agonized-looking. And the note has water damage, soot smudges, and little drops of blood.  And all it says is \"Don't fuck with time.\"\n\nSo he abandons that plan and just blasts the lock off.",

(I don't feel good about posting this, truly I don't. Its hard making the videos I do, because in regards to news, main stream media has been elevated on YouTube and small smaaall media tubers like me are eternally screwed by the algorithm.) \n\nEdit 2: Virologists and Zoologist's have been studying and sounding the alarm on Coronaviruses since the SARS pandemic in the early 2000s. They say there's an estimated 1.4 million Zoonotic viruses in mammals in the wild. The more we encroach on their habitat, the higher the risk for another novel outbreak. The more a changing climate pushes these mammals into human populated areas, the higher chance of a novel outbreak. The more forest we tear or let burn down, well, you get the point.",

For what it's worth I struggled(still do) with suicidal ideations, and severe depression since I was 10, and didn't ever expect to see 20. I'm 35 now. Still a fight at times, but therapy and meds have helped tremendously. As have the support subs for mental ilness here on reddit. There is help out there if he's inclined. For me, just knowing there are people I can count on helps a lot. Just being able to vent is all I need from friend and family, and psych helps with the heavier stuff. Best wishes for y'all. Dr Tracey Marks is a psychologist with an educational youtube page regarding mental health I found from one of the support subs that has helped me tremendously get a fram of reference for things. Going to link the first thing I come across as an easy access to her page.\nhttps://youtu.be/lx8-wrUI1hA\n\nAgain best wishes, I can only imagine how hard this is from that side of the table.\n\n\nEdit: I apreciate the gestures of the awards and was honestly a bit overwhelmed at the responce at first. I have no clue what to do with access to premium, and am just as likely to get lost in my art and forget I have it untill after it expires. I'd say save it for those who you know are into that kind of thing. Not intending to seem ungrateful, just feels like a bit of a waste on me. \n\nThanks again, and always remember there is help out there. Took me 6 months of searching and then 1 hour after initial contact to get an apointment with a psychologist once I found someone appropriate. Hehe, I don't normally post is subs with such large followings and forgot I wasn't speaking to just 1 person, but glad if anything I said helped others. \n\nGonna leave with a paraphrased Jello Biafra quote, \"Take care of [your community] and eachother!\"",

                                    "comment": "For me I think I needed to be heard and to get away from the toxic family life I was dealing with. StepDad had some narcissistic tendancies that could be brutal to cope with. Still managing that now. I think finding a good therapist and me coming to terms with the fact that I needed medication were major factors. Only in the last month have I really accepted that some meds are better than others and I might have to have a rough run on a few meds that don't work out untill I find one that does. The reddit support groups here are an amazing rescoirce for realizing it's not just me, others are struggeling too, and readinf some success and some horror stories(off meds, become manic, total a car 4 states away-they were unscathed in the accident)really drove home how important proper treatment is.\n\nCognitive Behaivioral Therapy has done wonders for giving me a better frame of reference and building coping skills for upcomming episodes and avoidinf others. The way it was explained to me was our actions affect our thoughts wich affect our moods, which affect how we feel. Much like the fire triangle(heat, fuel, oxygen) you adjust or remove 1 part of that, and the fire/crisis can't continue. It's sometimes adjusting my thinking(not letting little things cause me to rage out), sometimes adjusting my mood(music, or switching songs, relaxinf shower ect) or leaving the stressfull/depressing situation. Which ever of those 3 I can do something about, doesn't matter which, can help mitigate some of the worst of it.\n\nFinding hobbies to occupy my time, helped a lot. I might be depressed and isolate, but I'd spend hours on the guitiar or bass or drawing or reading. Sometimes I couldn't and had to learn that's ok too. Cteative outlets of any kind can be an amazing way to get controll of the thoughts in your head, or just give you something else to focus on for a bit.\n\nWasn't untill I found the reddit group that I realised how important community is. I can't always help myself, but I can share my experiences with others and not feel so lost or worthless. Was on an art sub when some1 informed me that my feed back was very usefull and it helped me realise I have more merits than I can give myself credit for at times.\n\nExercise and diet play a huge role in not feeling terrible, though I struggle with that. I inadvertently took labor jobs or jobs where what I though was ADHD was a positive and could stay active that way. Skateboarding and bmx ridinf were my other physical outlet when I was younger(13-late20's).\n\nAnd a good therapist also helped a lot. Mental ilness run in my family so by my late 20's it became very clear that I coukdn't do this on my own, and if I tried I had good examples of where that path lead.\n\nI think having a caring support system and findinf treatment are the biggest first steps as well as realising one needs help and that needing that help doesn't make you weak. I often refer to it as an emotional cancer. It's not suicide: it's a high mortality rate if left untreated. Your not going to beat lung cancer by \"getting over it\", nor can you do the same for psych issues. Not everyone needs meds for life, some can use the meds to manage the worst ofnthe symptoms and then use therapy to help build coping skills to navigate around the issues ascociated with our condition. Some of us do need meds for life. Is it a picnic? No. But neither is endless despair. Between the 2 I'll take beinf twitchy over being despondant.\n\nThe hardest part is there's no magic button, it's work. But nothing in life of value is ever easy, and like I remind myself and my support community we have value and are worth that effort.\n\nSorry for this wall of txt, I'm a bit verbose. Lurking on the reddit depression support subs can be helpfull. Beware the antipsych subs, most are people who are mislead, or have had a few terrible experiences and I can't say I blame them for thier mistrust; but that's not the whole of psychology. Yes I've had terrible doctors, but I've also had amazing ones as well.\n\nGood luck, it's a tough road, but one that is possible to navigate.",

I'm hoping that will change with time. I'd really like him to try CBT or DBT, but he won't. Thankfully he has found some online friends that support him. I'll check out your link after I've had a chance to sleep more. I'm happy to hear that you've found and accepted help. I wish you happiness in life.",

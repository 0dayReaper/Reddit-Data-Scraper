            "comment": "I am a police officer in a medium sized suburban town in Texas. I have been in law enforcement for 14 years. I love my job, I love how I get to help people and I love how I get to cause positive changes in peoples' lives. I love how 99.9% of the time, my badge is shiny...today my badge is not shiny.\n\nI am tired of hearing the excuses given by other people for a police officer's misconduct. I am tired of excuses being made for people who tarnish my badge. I am so tired of hearing how officers have a stressful job and their misconduct was a result of that stress. You know who else is under stress? The people who called us, that person whose loved one just committed suicide, the family who called us because they found grandma dead and now we're asking everyone questions, the 7-11 clerk who just had a gun shoved in his face, and even the guy we just put in handcuffs and told him he is losing his freedom. Sorry, but our stress is low compared to these folks. We might have to go into these situations, but we get to leave them and pretend none of that shit ever happened after our shift is over.\n\nI am tired of hearing excuses for the bad police officers, I am tired of the excuse \"well, he puts his life in danger\". Sure, I know we put our lives in danger, I've had guns, knives and even swords pulled on me. I've responded to bomb threats, suicidal subjects, assaults in progress, robberies in progress, etc. You know who else puts their lives in danger? Fire fighters, deep sea fisherman, loggers, people who step foot outside their homes in Chicago. We are trained to deal with danger, we are provided with equipment and training to help us survive those dangers. Do I face an increased risk of not going home? Sure, but that's why I am at an increased level of awareness at work, so I can respond to threats appropriately without panic and over responding.\n\nI am tired of hearing about the thin blue line. I believe in the thin blue line, I believe in looking out for my fellow officers. I don't believe in hiding the misconduct or unlawfulness of other officers, and I have always spoken up. What many forget, standing behind the thin blue line doesn't mean concealing the misconduct of other officers, it means confronting those officers so they don't do something to ruin their lives, the lives of others, or violate the law or code of conduct. It means walking up to the officer with his knee on a suspect's neck and saying \"dude, this is too much, stop\", before the officer commits murder. It means walking up to the officer who has been drinking all night and saying \"dude, I'll give you a ride home\". Instead of hiding misconduct, prevent it, help your fellow officer not do something to ruin his life or another's life. If you do see misconduct, address it, take it to the appropriate level, stop tarnishing my badge. We took an oath to uphold the law, uphold our ethics and protect our communities, sometimes that means arresting other police officers or holding them accountable for policy/ethics violations.\n\nThis officer violated the rights of George Floyd and murdered him through his actions. The officers who were on scene and failed to act are just as responsible. There are multiple videos of this incident and there is no real question as to what happened.\n\nFor those folks who wonder what makes it murder or manslaughter. Murder is the act of causing death to another human being through an action which a reasonable person would know (or intend) could result in the death of the victim. Manslaughter is the act of causing death through an act which is reckless in nature.\n\nEvery officer in America is taught about positional asphyxiation and while some departments allow neck restraints, all officers are taught the dangers of neck restraints and are taught not to apply pressure to the back of someone's neck or head when they are proned out on the ground in handcuffs.\n\nFloyd was handcuffed with little resistance and they were able to walk him across the street to a patrol unit. Floyd can be seen in a surveillance video falling to the ground next to the unit on the sidewalk side of the unit. Cell phone footage then shows the officer on top of Floyd's neck on the opposite side of the unit, the street side. There is a random man in the background telling Floyd just to get in the car and he can't win. Floyd can be heard saying he knows and he's done. This implies that Floyd may have resisted or attempted to escape, but was still restrained in the handcuffs. Floyd can be heard multiple times saying he can't breathe. The cell phone video shows the officer kneeling on top of Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes, with around four of those minutes with Floyd being unconscious.\n\nEven if Floyd did attempt to resist or escape, there was no reason to hold him down for eight minutes. What was the point of restraining him for so long? Why did the other officer not assist the primary officer with restraining Floyd so they could get him in the patrol unit quicker? Why did the primary officer continue to restrain Floyd by his neck after Floyd became unresponsive? Why can the officer be heard at some point asking Floyd if he is still a tough guy? I can only come up with one answer to all of these questions, and that was the primary officer, Chauvin, wanted to prove to Floyd that Floyd was not such a tough guy. I see an officer assaulting another human being, going beyond taking control of a suspect, using force as punishment and ultimately causing the death of another human being. I see a second officer who stood and watched and did nothing, despite knowing that what the first officer was doing was a violation of law and policy. I see officers who were trying to get back at Floyd for running his mouth and resisting an arrest by using force they KNEW could result in death or serious bodily injury in a situation which did not justify using deadly force.\n\nThis officer committed murder, plain and simple. This officer tarnished my badge and the badges of all police officers. Worst of all, this officer tortured his victim for eight minutes, imagine your last thoughts and memories being those of a police officer, a person who the public is supposed to be able to trust, placing his body weight on your neck, slowly asphyxiating you against hot asphalt while he asks you if you're still a tough guy. I hope this officer, and any officer who allowed this to happen, is tried and convicted. It's going to be some time before I can polish my badge back to a shine, in the mean time, a family is suffering, a community is burning, all because of one guy who should have never been an officer.\n\nWhat do I think? I think assholes like this make my job that much harder and damage the trust I work so hard for. I think assholes like this ruin peoples' lives and ruin families. I think assholes like these should be stuck in a prison with all of the people they ever arrested.",

                            "comment": "House that we frequent because of domestic issues. Grandma keeps allowing the kids, I say kids but they are in their 20's, to move back in. The grandkids then take advantage of grandma and steal her stuff to sell for meth. Grandma refuses to not let them back because she says it is against her Mexican heritage. \n\nWell one day, younger grandson comes back to the house and starts stealing again. Grandma catches him and tells him to leave, he punches her in return. We get called out and I am first on scene. When I arrived, the only information I had was he was refusing to leave, I did not know about the physical violence yet. I also missed the part where dispatch let us know he had a gun because I was exiting my unit and putting my ear piece in. \n\nAs I walked up to the home, I knocked and then I could hear him on the other side saying \"I'm not going back to jail, they're going to have to kill me.\" This is generally a clue that someone is psyching themselves up to fight. I backed off to give myself some room in case I needed to get cover. Dispatch readvised he possibly has a gun and I looked around for more substantial cover but I was stuck in the relative open. \n\nHe answers the door and is obviously strung out on meth with brass knuckles in hand. He recognizes me and I ask him to please put the knuckles down and he does. I then noticed there was a hammer, an axe, and the knuckles all easily within arms reach. I have no clear view of what is behind him and I can see a bulge in his waist band. I do my best to keep him calm and tell him that I was just there to talk, and obviously if I had immediate plans to take him to jail he would be in cuffs. He is calming down but still refusing to step outside. \n\nAfter a couple of minutes, he can hear the sirens of my backup coming and he says \"you know what? fuck this\", reaches behind him and grabs a machete which he has modified into a small sword. He begins moving toward me while cocking his arm back wit the machete. I pulled my gun and pointed it at his face and I moved forward to make my intentions clear. He ends up dropping the machete and pissing himself. At this point, he becomes very compliant and steps out and I find he has a BB gun in his waist band which looks like a S&amp;W pistol, fake logo and all, and various other weapons strewn around. I get him cuffed and other officers finally show up on scene and check the house for any other persons while I escort him to my unit.\n\nAs I am walking up to the unit, he tells me he is not going to get in my car. I ask him why and he says the governor wants him dead and he knows cops like to kill brown people. Now, I try to use humor when I can to deescalate situations. I have dealt with this guy enough I know what is humorous to him. I tell him, \"dude, if I wanted to shoot you, I had every right to do so at the house, even your grandma would have called that justified. If I shoot you in my car, my chief is going to be PISSED about the bloody mess I made.\" This actually succeeded in making him smile, agree, and get in my car.\n\nHe ended up convicted for Continous Family Violence, Robbery, and the brass knuckles. His defense attorney, at trial, actually approached me and complimented the way I handled the situation, the collection of information and the report. Told me the only reason they were even in court is because they believed grandma would refuse to testify or cooperate...she cooperated on this one though, she was done with him finally.",

I started my day by showing the video to my officers and making sure my people understood that this is murder, plain and simple. You never, outside of a life and death struggle, do anything like this. \n\nGeorge Floyd was handcuffed and on the ground. If he was still struggling badly enough that they felt a need to hold him down, there's a hundred ways to do it safely. Use of force should always be as measured and considered as possible. There will always be times where an officer sees danger and has to make a split second decision without the luxury of weighing the consequences. That clearly was not the case here. He had all the time in the world to think about what he was doing. He had multiple people there telling him to stop. And none of his fellow officers intervened. All of that is why I find this incident particularly disgusting. They had so many chances to do the right thing. \n\nLuckily, I have the fortune of working with good people who see this shit for what it is. Before the video was over, before I told them that George Floyd died because of this, my officers were muttering things like, \"What the fuck is he doing?\" \"You can't do that shit\" and \"He needs to get off the man's fucking neck!\" Made me way prouder to be their leader than any number of arrests they could make to see that their instincts were not to defend the officer. \n\nFor what it's worth, I'm glad that they were fired. I've heard mention in this thread that one of the officers has been arrested, which is great if true. I hope they're all brought to justice. Their actions (and lack thereof) were completely unconscionable.",

He was trying to get some kids to leave an area they were in illegally and these children were being verbally aggressive and physically by snapping wet towels at him.  In a momentary lapse of reason, he pulled his gun.\n\nI've watched the video.  As soon as his gun came out, three officers were there pushing his hand down and saying no.  He put the gun away, turned around, went home and resigned.  Bad day, bad decision, he knew he had fucked up.  You could see the instant he realized how screwed he was and realized how badly he screwed up.\n\nBut, if his fellow officers hadn't stepped in?  Would his anger have been enough to shoot a teenager?  We'll never know because his fellow officers did the right thing.",

It\u2019s basically that all cops will stand together because no one else will stand with them, and if you don\u2019t agree then you\u2019re not a real cop and not part of the \u201cthin blue line\u201d. Like the above said, it guides all facets of identity, politics, and general socialization. You socialize with cops and cop families and because they\u2019re \u201cpart of the thin blue line\u201d, and it just becomes an echo chamber. When you don\u2019t echo what\u2019s in the echo chamber you get cast aside, no promotions, your reviews are never favorable, the whole experience is just walking uphill barefoot in the snow without a paddle. My dad did it for 25 years because he was really passionate about making a difference in the community and he found his niche and became so good at it he couldn\u2019t be fired, but he had stacks of bad reviews and plenty of promotions he got passed over for (he was a beat cop till he retired). He considered himself part of the TBL but he wasn\u2019t really, especially not the same way that these new cops are in the 21st century.",

Some of the police chiefs in particular have warned about this police culture and said they take active steps to avoid it and try to get away from the thin blue line idea. They're stand-up guys who encourage their officers to come forward when they see something shady and even punish those who don't come forward when they know someone's dirty. One of them repeatedly advised us to, if we became police, make sure we socialized with people outside of work, keep up hobbies, etc. because people do get sucked in and stuck.\n\nSo it seems like some departments are catching on and improving, even if it's slow.",

I made the point that the bad cops seem to be able to get away with bad behavior all the time. They are never treated like everyone else and police departments seem to bend over backwards to protect them. He said to the effect 'well, it's a hard job and we all need to know the other guy has our back. If we turn on each other like that then it destroys the trust.' \n\nMy response was basically if that's the truth then there is no such thing as good cops. If good cops protect the bad ones instead of going after them harder than they do other people then they are worse than the crooked cops.\n\nIf you're a cop then just do your fucking job. It doesn't matter if the guy is wearing a badge or not. If he's a piece of shit criminal than arrest that piece of shit and put his ass away.",

Humor goes a long way and it's very important not to give off any sign of being fearful. They can sense it. You get used to shouts of abuse as you drive by and guys on the corner will try to provoke you by openly drinking beer. Is it illegal? Yes, but you learned to pick your battles.  If you do ever need to stop someone and question them, you know that if you take too long, you will suddenly find yourself surrounded by an angry crowd who have no idea what you are asking. People in these areas are almost always reluctant to even be seen conversing with a cop out of fear of being seen as a snitch.  It is true that if you do need to make an arrest, there will almost always be some level of resistance, which makes things very difficult as once you have made the commitment to make the arrest, you have to go through with it.  \n\nI am not in any way making excuses for the cops in this particular video, but it isn't easy.  However, the cop with his knee on the poor guy appears to be of the alpha male type of cop.  These guys are bullies by nature and very difficult to work with if you personally police to different standards. It's very difficult to intervene as a partner as you will likely be ostracized. You take this route and your career is over. Your social life is over.  Your marriage will have problems as cop families are pretty close.",

Call 911 and report police brutality? In all seriousness, what is the preventative action here since none of the police officers on the scene (4 of which were physically restraining him) reacted to his being murdered right in front of them?\n\nEdit: thank you u/murderbymodem for this link [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct). I\u2019m adding it to my post because I think others will appreciate it and I don\u2019t want it to get lost.\n\nEdit: In summary, some of the options proposed are below. I apologize if I omitted, misrepresented, or oversimplified anything. *The bystanders in this case did many of these things and they were a voice for George when he couldn\u2019t speak for himself.*\n\n1. Always record the incident (live streaming if possible) and inform the police they are being recorded. \n\n2. Involve other authorities when applicable such as police supervisors, state police, 911 (ask for supervisor and an ambulance to report immediately), ACLU, FBI(?). Tell the officers on site that you are involving other authorities. \n\n3. Deescalation: back any crowd or bystanders away from the scene and officers (while still being able to record the incident). Have one person (preferably a white person) attempt to approach the officer(s) as a medical professional or voice of reason to explain that it appears that medical treatment may be required and remind the officer(s) that their best interests (career, family, reputation etc) are to act responsibly. \n\n4. Create a diversion/distraction that requires the officers to release the hold (not custody) of anyone in imminent medical danger. \n\n5. Physically remove the threat imposed by the officer(s) by force (this includes exercising your right to carry and discharge a gun). I think everyone agrees that this option will most likely result in physical (potentially fatal) and legal ramifications for the individual(s) involved unless the group of bystanders are organized enough and outnumber the officers on the scene to the extent that they can safely take control without further harm. \n\n6. Systemic change: Vote (local and national) for people that value human life and will implement change to protect it (this is not an anti-gun sentiment - if you value your right to carry a gun then vote for people that support that). Be vocal in demanding justice when these incidents occur. Push for improved training, hiring practices, and accountability within the police force. I would imagine that this may also include increasing pay for the police force to attract more suitable individuals into the positions. Possibly implement a citizen based governing body to oversee the police force and their actions.",

The cop asked us where we were going and then if he could search the car. The driver told them no. So they ordered us all out of the car into the cold and told us we couldn't wear our jackets because there might be weapons in them. We were going to wait for the K9 unit to come sniff the car for drugs.\n\nThe driver called his mom when we first got pulled over because honestly, as black people, we are afraid of cops and feel they are a danger to us (this was in 2003 long before BLM). She called to check up on us 30 minutes later and we were still pulled over. She got busy and called back 2 hours later to ask what had happened. We told her we were still outside waiting for the K9 unit.\n\nShe called the station and asked for their supervisor. The supervisor called the officers and they immediately let us go.",

It was ruled in 2015 so it wasn\u2019t quite that time, but it\u2019s still something all motorists should know about. Dennys Rodriguez was detained for \u201cseven or eight minutes\u201d before a k-9 arrived in scene. According to the Supreme Court, officers can use a k-9 to sniff around a car during a stop, they cannot prolong the length of the stop in order to carry that out. Ruth Bader Ginsberg delivered the ruling, stating: T]he tolerable duration of police inquiries in the traffic-stop context is determined by the seizure's 'mission' - to address the traffic violation that warranted the stop. Authority for the seizure thus ends when tasks tied to the traffic infraction are - or reasonably should have been - completed.\" \n\nTLDR: police can use a dog during a traffic stop, but not detain to wait for one. \n\n[sauce](https://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/239513-court-rules-cops-cant-hold-suspects-to-wait-for-dog%3famp)",

If there are articulable facts that give rise to reasonable belief that another crime has been, is being, or is about to be committed, the mission of the seizure changes and the detention can be extended while those concerns are addressed. In the context of waiting for a K-9, that could mean any observation that would reasonably lead an objective person to believe there was reason to suspect drugs or explosives in the vehicle.",

You either commit a crime yourself and risk the same fate or you call the next level of police and hope it\u2019s not too late. I think this is an important place to start with in reform. There needs to be immediate legal action that can be taken if you feel a police officer is threatening someone\u2019s life. Life is precious and we have to do better.",

This was his post this morning in regards to this exact question.\n\n&gt;\"Watching a Murder\n\n&gt;I had a friend send me a message this morning. He wanted to know how a bystander might intervene in a situation like what happened in Minneapolis. How does one safely intervene when cops are mistreating a prisoner?\n\n&gt;Violent action won't help. You will be arrested and likely beaten as well. If you physically attack the cop it might actually make it worse for the guy you are trying to protect.\n\n&gt;Here's what I would do, keeping in mind that this is my personal opinion and not legal or tactical advice. I just want to give you some options so you don't have to stand there and watch someone get killed.\n\n&gt;As you approach, walk slowly with your hands in plain view. Don't move in too close. You don't want the officers to see you as a threat. Move close enough to talk to the officer, but not close enough to touch.\n\n&gt;Probably the best thing to do is to approach another officer on scene who has less ego involvement rather than the kneeling dude.\n\n&gt;Say something like: \"Hey officer, I just want to let you know that the guy on the ground appears to be suffering from a medical condition. I don't know if the officer controlling him knows he's kneeling on the dude's neck. People are videotaping and it doesn't look good. I just don't want you guys to get in trouble.\"\n\n&gt;If someone approached me at a similar scene in that manner, I would most certainly go check things out and ensure that the prisoner is OK.\n\n&gt;If there is no one else, I'd approach the officer and focus on the medical issues. \"Officer, let me help you. I've had advanced medical training and that guy doesn't look so good. Let's move him on to his side and away from the car so that he can breathe better and I'll check him out for you.\"\n\n&gt;Another way that might work is \"Officer, are you OK? I'm a martial arts instructor. Can I help you hold him down so that you don't have to kneel on his neck? Just tell me what you want me to do and I'll do it.\"\n\n&gt;I think those strategies might have a high likelihood of success, but ultimately if the officers refuse your aid, there isn't much else you can do.\n\n&gt;As a last resort, I'd call 911 and tell the dispatchers that the officers on scene are in danger of killing their prisoner and request that both a supervisor and an ambulance respond to the scene. I'd say that might have a 50/50 chance of working depending on who the boss is and how busy they are.\"",

In the USA, police have ultimate omnipotent power over everything and everyone, except for judges in court.\n\nSo basically, police can do whatever they want. We can't stop them while it's happening. Our only option is to let them have their way and do what they want. Then, long after the fact, we have to try and fight what they did with a judge; and that's if they case even gets to court.\n\nThe USA police system is BROKEN. I want police to feel empowered to do their job and protect and keep the peace, but police should also feel restricted in that they also have to follow a code of conduct.\n\nAs a citizen, I know that I better not assault an office because I will get severe punishment. Officers should know that if they feel they need to take someone's life, they better have a DAMN GOOD reason.\n\nEVERY TIME an officer kills someone, they should have to explain and speak to the reason of the killing to a JUDGE. If you're an officer and feel your life is in danger, fine, shoot him, but just know that you will need to justify that every time you do it or be charged with murder. If a police feels they need to kill someone they better be damn sure they have good evidence to explain to the judge.\n\nJust like if someone breaks into my house. I can shoot that person, but I will have to explain myself and prove that it was necessary. Police should have to do the same every single time they kill someone.",

This includes all safety aspects including where to apply handcuffs, how tight they should be, ensuring the technique is done correctly and that the subject is in a controlled but safe position.\n\nPositional asphyxia is a VITAL topic we cover and it is reiterated time and time again that if a subject ends up on the ground we never, and I reiterate again, NEVER, place any sort of weight on them. \nHell even when sitting in the back of our cars, we watch them and ensure they can breath and are in a comfortable position for transport.\n\nWhat these cops did was just plain stupid, disproportionate and frankly an embarrassment to Policing.  I'd also use disgusting if I'm honest. \n\nI just hope that people know we are not like this.\n\nEDIT: This is my first comment and it has received more attention that I could have imagined, which I thank you all for!\n\nTo address some points raised in the replies.

As for what was going on his head, I have no idea whether it be \"red mist\" or he thought something else.  Either way he should lose his job and face the full consequences of his action.\n\nUnfortunately some hate, as expected, in some replies which I understand.

You immediately begin checking their well being before you even read miranda rights or interrogate.\n\nThere was an incredible amount of emphasis on asphyxiation and its not tolerated for obvious reasons. It was emphasized greatly because they know the danger and its not even the safest hold for the officer. \n\nThe officer in the video seemed to lack training, empathy, and most importantly common sense. Its not an unknown topic to never put your knee/foot/forearm/hand on their neck. Its talked about in training, at least for us it was. \n\nEdit: when i said lacked training I meant its poor technique. I didn't mean it was the primary reason or anything, just that it stood out to me because it goes against what I was taught on a fundamental level",

My friend is an officer today and he was trained to use his words, not his weapons on first instinct. He said you are supposed to police by consent.\n\nIt's police service, not force after all.\n\nI know Hot Fuzz is a comedy but when Simon Pegg tells Nick Frost his most important tool is his logbook it's so true.\n\nI never feared the Police when we were out and about back home. Probably because your average bobby doesn't have a gun.\n\nIn America, I'm not so sure I have that same confidence. \n\nThose that join the Police to wield power and fear need to be rooted out.

I'll fall asleep at my desk, on the bus, on the toilet... as a kid I'd come home from school and just make it through the front door before falling asleep on the floor fully clothed with my backpack still on. I paid for a sight-seeing bus tour along the river Nile in Egypt and slept through most of it because I always sleep on car rides. I read books 3 pages at a time with lots of accidental naps in between.\n\nMy big question is how do people stay awake and alert for a whole day? My flatmates sleep 5-6 hours a night and I get tired just thinking about it!",

Much easier to fall asleep when your body has been engaged in physical activity during the day.  \n\nI try to lay perfectly still, and not allow myself to scratch my nose if it itches, for example.  I just ignore the itch and next thing I know, it\u2019s time to get up.  \n\nI just discovered that there are people with an inner monologue and this voice in their head allows them to have silent discussions and worry about decisions and whatnot.   I don\u2019t have this.   I don\u2019t have any voices talking to me.  \n\nMy preference is also to listen to a documentary on YouTube or Netflix.  I set my timer On my phone to stop playing after 20 mins and rarely stay awake till the end.  I am very well versed on the first 10 minutes of wwii!",

Start by cutting inner monologues; imagine you were born deaf and think primarily in images. Then cut those and just focus on what you feel. The last step is to tune out those sensations. In the beginning, you will only be able to sustain it for a couple seconds, but you'll be able to go longer with time. Eventually, it'll be second nature. \n\nIn the beginning, my primary goal was to remove the stress of my life for a moment through meditation, but it ended up being a useful way to fall asleep. Also, I don't remember the last time I've woken up in the middle of the night. The only downside is that I sleep like the dead and never dream. I just close my eyes as if to blink and when I open them back up, it's morning (and my wife is pissed that I missed my alarm).",

We've tried whatever bullshit herb or sleep aide is popular this week. \n\nThat shit just doesn't work. It's not our faults. Our brains are just idiots.",

I decided to truly let my body decide when it wanted to sleep. I tried practicing perfect sleep hygiene exactly as prescribed. \n\nI didn't notice an improvement in my sleep schedule. I'd be awake at the weirdest hours of the night... But when I was actually tired, I'd fall asleep easily! and more importantly I woke up feeling rested! Unfortunately that could mean sleeping from 3am-11pm on Monday, having a 90 minute nap at 1pm on Tuesday then sleeping from 4pm-1am on Wednesday... And that's not something I can do during the working week. Every day was different. \n\nAfter 2 months I brought my sleep diary back to her and she took one look and said \"oh... You dont have insomnia and sleep deprivation related crashes like we thought...looks like you have a circadian rhythm disorder\" she sent me for further testing to confirm, but yeah, my internal body clock is set to shuffle. \n\nNo amount of \"don't drink coffee after midday\" is going to fix a congenital neurological condition. (and idiopathic insomnia is also technically a neurological condition!)\n\nBut melatonin sure helps!\n\nI've had so many lay people tell me \"oooh, careful with taking melatonin every night, prolonged use can destroy your body's ability to fall asleep without it\" um, my body's ability to fall asleep naturally was already fucked. My doctor prescribes my medication and I'll trust them.\n\nWith my current dose, I can fall asleep within 20 minutes of hitting the pillow, no matter what time it is. It doesn't help me *stay* asleep, but I've never had issues with that, I'm a deep sleeper, other than owning a small bladder.",

As you exhale mentally relax each muscle group starting with your face and working down to your toes. Try to imagine exhaling through your muscles and out through your toes. Imagine your body slowly melting into your bed. This usually takes about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  \n  \nNext imagine as vividly as possible a river. It helps if you use one from memory. I personally use a combination of The River Wild movie and memories from a family trip to the Green River. Imagine yourself walking out to the middle of the river. Let yourself get lost in the flow around you. Try to imagine any stray thoughts as floating to you on the river. As you think of things, set them in the water and watch them float away.  \n  \nThis process without fail gets me to sleep within 10 minutes, if I am having trouble sleeping. But like Ralph Wiggum, sleep is where I am a viking.  \n  \nThanks for the gold kind stranger!  \n  \n\nSorry for my abysmal Simpsons knowledge. I think I really just wanted Ralph to be an amazing genius who kills people in space and commits xenocide.",

            "comment": "Okay so after years of tossing &amp; turning and having horrible sleeps I've come close to nailing my routine:\n\n- exercise during the day\n- wake up &amp; go to bed at the same time every day (if possible), that way your body knows when it's time to crash \n-  magnesium supplement with melatonin &amp; GABA about an hour before I want to fall asleep\n- weighted. blanket. For whatever reason helps me relax like nothing else.\n- I actually can now usually fall asleep within a few minutes of going to bed, but if not I play a little mind game. Body scanning is a solid one, just imagine a ray of sunlight slowly going over you from your toes to your head, and relax your muscles as the \"sunlight\" goes over them. I hope that makes sense - there's a lot of guided meditations on YouTube that can walk you through it. I also pick a category and try to name one thing in that category for every letter of the alphabet (ex. fruits: Apple, Banana, Cantaloupe, zzzzzzz). And finally I sometimes imagine walking down to the beach near my house and taking a nap there, although I rarely make it far enough to take a nap now. \n\nNone of this stuff works right away, but even one can make a huge difference with some commitment, so just  give it a bit of time :)\n\nEdit to add: KEEP! YOUR! ROOM! COLD!!!! This one actually worked for me a bit more quickly because I had/have issues with nightmares (to the point where my husband literally can calm me down in his sleep), and I saw a major correlation between that and the heat of my room. I switched from a duvet that had me waking up drenched in sweat to a weighted blanket with a bamboo cover that manages to not trap my body heat. Apparently hot showers before bed and wearing warm socks can also help you cool down as your body tries to self-regulate (or something?)",

A proper pillow that doesn't overheat. And lastly the weighted blanket which is helpful at immobilization and associated with bedtime. I started taking GABA about 45 minutes before bed on stressful days. Since I started falling asleep has gotten so much easier. Reading in bed seems to help too. My mind drifts and then I set the book down and I'm out fast.\n\nMade the changes because I used to be a night owl. Up all night. I changed jobs and the commute requires so much more time that I have to have a routine. I never used to get more than 5 hours if sleep. Now I get far more and quality sleep. \n\nAll great suggestions and it did take time for this to improve. Over the course of 6 months for me.",

Worrying about stuff keeps him up at night where as I go to bed with the reassurance I\u2019ve done all I can do that day and que sera sera\n2. He brings his phone to bed and browses reddit, I\u2019m strictly no screens an hour before bed.\n3. Other than bringing the phone to bed, he has no routine. By about 9:30, I\u2019m winding down with my skincare routine, washing up, making a hot drink, and then in bed with a book by 10:15 at the latest\n4. Since I\u2019m the high energy person in the relationship, I am moving and doing things all the time - get home from work, cooking, have dinner, work out, do some laundry, read before bed. I\u2019m pretty physically tired/drained by the time I hit the pillow. My husband runs at what seems to be a consistently lower energy level - like low enough that he needs a lot of downtime (usually in front of screens) to recharge, but high enough that he doesn\u2019t sleep well",

I went from taking hrs upon hrs to fall asleep but now if I say I'm going to bed I'll be asleep for you can say \"okay\" which can sometimes be a bad thing hahaha\n\nStart by turning off all electronics you are using, lay down, close your eyes, and NO MATTER WHAT do not open them till morning.\n\nAt first it's painful because you'll lay with your eyes shut for hours in boredom but after a few weeks of doing this every night your body gets trained into falling asleep faster and faster.\n\nIt's basically breaking the habit of not being able to fall asleep. Hope this helps you sleep better :)",

White cotton sheets, white cotton pillowcases, etc.\n\n* I try to make my bed or at least keep it semi-made, because I have an easier time falling asleep when the sheets are straight and my blanket's lined up properly.\n\n* I wear white cotton pajamas without buttons or anything scratchy because if I'm even a little bit uncomfortable it's much harder to fall asleep.\n\n* I braid my hair before bed, which stops my hair from getting in my face (because again, I can't sleep if I'm uncomfortable.)  As an added bonus, keeping my hair braided stops it from wrapping around my neck and throttling me while I sleep.\n\n* I use a very heavy blanket.  (It's not weighted, but I knit it myself and handknit blankets weigh more than store-bought blankets.)\n\n* I keep my feet warm, because for some reason that helps.  Depending on the season, I'll either use a heated blanket, heating pad, or just wear socks.\n\n* I don't try to go to bed unless I actually feel tired.  There's this sort of wave of sleepiness that hits me at night, and if I get in bed ~20 minutes of that happening, I pass out almost immediately.  (If I miss that window, I get an adrenaline rush and will be up forever.)\n\n* I try to do soothing, repetitive things at night before bed.  Knitting, folding laundry, etc.\n\n* Sometimes I wear blue-light filtering glasses because that is supposed to help your body properly produce sleep hormones.  And if it doesn't, well, the placebo affect's pretty powerful too.\n\n* If nothing else works, I take melatonin and slowly drink a cup of tea while reading *Calvin and Hobbes.*  (I've got ADHD, caffeine relaxes me.)",

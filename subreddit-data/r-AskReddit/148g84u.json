Writing everything by hand is a thing of the past due to the ubiquity of personal computers and forcing students to write in cursive discriminates against those with mental disabilities such as myself. It makes as much sense as teaching students how to use an abacus or how to repair a typewriter.",

It exists because in the days of quill pens it was advantageous to keep your pen in continuous contact with the paper (so you didn't get ink blots).  Cursive has been obsolete since ballpoint pens became cheap many decades ago.",

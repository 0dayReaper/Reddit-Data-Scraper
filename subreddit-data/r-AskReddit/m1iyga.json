I just develop the content production tools. But we collect an unbelievable amount of data and have data science, data analytics, and decision science teams that do a lot of work with that data. Exactly what, I\u2019m not sure, but it\u2019s somehow related to getting you to buy AT&amp;T, Comcast, and other shitty telecom shit.\n\nEdit:\n\nwhat I do know is that people can be recognized even with anonymous data. Anonymous data basically just means everything about your behavior and demographics that doesn\u2019t actually identify you, so basically everything besides things like your name or confidential information like medical stuff. Marketers don\u2019t care about identifying you, they care about trends in the data. For example, people of certain demographics or living in certain places are more likely to buy certain things. So that you can focus your marketing efforts on those more easily converted leads and waste less time bothering people who aren\u2019t interested.\n\nThings like your IP address are part of that, like others have mentioned. But it\u2019s more than that too. For web apps like Reddit, patterns in where and when and on which device you log in can be enough to recognize you, or at least make a confident guess. For a marketing site like the trash I work around in my job, they aren\u2019t showing ads so identifying individuals is less relevant than the bigger picture of how people in general react to the site. Things like, visitors always call to buy after visiting this page, or visitors often visit this site before visiting that one, or how many pages on a site people visit etc. This data is used to optimize the marketing experience of the sites and to attribute conversions to different sources like certain ad campaigns or affiliates.",

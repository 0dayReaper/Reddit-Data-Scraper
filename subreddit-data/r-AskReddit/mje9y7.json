We\u2019ve all seen the \u201chow would you feel about \\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d in which the OP is just posting what is considered a \"shower thought\" which is aimed to ask users to support a largely popular concept in a way that fits AskReddit\u2019s rules. Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don\u2019t have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback we\u2019ve received, we\u2019ve decided to remove these posts moving forward.\n\nWe do understand that there\u2019s some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions.\n\nFor example:\n\n* \u201c*How would you feel about a \u2019if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,\u2019 button for Reddit?*\u201d is really just a feature suggestion.\n* \u201c*How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?*\u201d is a discussion question.\n\nOur philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your \u201dHow would you feel\u201d post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we\u2019ll be happy to manually review.\n\nThank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy. We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration. If you or anyone you know has been diagnosed with mesoth...sorry, wrong script...if you have feedback for us, we always appreciate it as we want to give people the best experience in AskReddit.\n\nWith love,\n\nThe Ass Credit Mods",

They asked me for my input, and were very interested in my answer.\n\n The coworker who posed the question would take prison....the other was initially going to ride in the helicopter but was then convinced that a year in prison would be less bad. I was 1/3 that would spend a few seconds of my life \"embarrassed\" instead of being incarcerated for a year. I know these guys well enough to know they were not joking. I wish I was...",

I wound up feeling bad.\n\nI was drinking in the middle of the night and watching an old music video. I scrolled down to the comments and saw the sea of \u201cWho\u2019s still watching in 2019!\u201d comments. Those had never not annoyed me, especially when it\u2019s a particular video that I\u2019d like to see real comments about. So, in my tipsy, annoyed, probably-on-my-period state, I posted a very passive aggressively-worded AskReddit asking people why they do that. \n\nAnyway, did not expect it to go anywhere, but it got thousands of upvotes. I\u2019m pretty sure it got more upvotes than anything I\u2019d ever posted in nearly ten years, lol. I just didn\u2019t realize it until I woke up the next day. About 90% of the comments were a circlejerk of people who agreed with me and shamed these people, then maybe 7% people shaming me for posting something dumb and passive aggressive, and then the final 3%, which were people answering the question honestly.\n\nThe people who actually do the YouTube thing were basically like, \u201cI\u2019m depressed/have low self esteem/have a shitty life and getting likes on things makes me feel better even if it\u2019s something meaningless\u201d\n\nI felt so shitty about that post after that. Hell, I\u2019ve been shamed for stupid things I do or silly things that make me happy and it\u2019s a really embarrassing feeling. I carry around enough shame and sadness as is, the last thing I want is to feel shame for something harmless that makes me feel better. I almost deleted the post, but since I did make a point to apologize to a couple people within the thread and walked away from it feeling differently, I decided to leave it up. Just in the chance that someone might see those comments and see that not all Reddit disagreements end with hostility and that people who leave those comments probably aren\u2019t doing so great in life.",

We don't want to spend our time on this sub reading fiction (I mean, a good chunk of AskReddit answers are probably also fiction, but at least we can pretend they're real)\n\n- \"Huge amounts of money\" questions.

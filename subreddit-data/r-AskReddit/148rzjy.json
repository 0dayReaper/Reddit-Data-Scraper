They are people and people like to be listened to when they speak and enjoy the company of friendly, engaged non -twitchy people - which i can pretend to be. Ordinarily there are some number of steps between liking a girl and than girl letting you fiddle with her vagina, obtaining her number is one of those steps",

Hell pick the hottest girl and you know nearly 100% of the time she will reject you, but do it. Then again she might say yes, but you will never know unless you try. You are going to get rejected just dont let it stop you. That and just be the normal you.",

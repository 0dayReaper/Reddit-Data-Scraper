Remind yourself of your own boundaries. You should accept the feeling to yourself fully and understand it. Why is still there when you know it's wrong? What caused so? Being aware of only your feelings isn't enough to be able to get rid of it, you should also know the reason. Then you will understand and claim the certainity of the feeling and reason with yourself about it. Simply ignoring it doesn't work out for some and even causes after- damages.",

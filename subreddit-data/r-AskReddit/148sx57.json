One friend of a friend who was always there liked me and wanted to get to know me. He started chatting with me on AIM, I didn't have much in common with him but would respond to his messages because we hung in the same circles. At one point the messaging became sexual on his end, and he sexually pressured me in person which was fairly traumatic. I had to stop going to the ice rink to avoid him because he was spreading rumors he would assault me. I stopped logging into AIM but he kept creating new accounts to try to friend me on myspace, and when I left myspace, he tried to add me on facebook. This was like several friend requests weekly for a year. He would search for me at places he thought I was, one time approaching me while I was with family at the mall, and following us while we were there. It took a year and moving 4 states away for him to stop.",

For many drugs they're cheaper than the big chains in the first place, but they'll often price match too. Discount cards like GoodRx save you money but charge the pharmacy a fee on every claim.\n\nNeedyMeds is another good resource.",

There is no need to be concerned if you have been pwned multiple times; almost all will be from mass data breaches and it is unlikely you will ever be targeted specifically. However, *it is a good idea to close accounts you no longer use and to change the passwords on accounts you use regularly*.",

            "comment": "Sorry for the long post, but here it goes:\n\n(Corrected spelling and added some new links and name for latest Tracktion version)\n\n[vstplanet.com](https://vstplanet.com) and [vst4free.com](https://vst4free.com) if you want to get loads of awesome Virtual Studio Technology instruments and effects. Also has lots of other downloads for freeware Digital Audio Workstations, Trackers, Editors, and other tools.\n\nTo make some great drum sounds, there is Stomper Hyperion (get the zip file version) [https://www.lysator.liu.se/\\~zap/stomper/stomper.zip](https://www.lysator.liu.se/~zap/stomper/stomper.zip) and Drumsynth:  [http://mda.smartelectronix.com/drumsynth.htm](http://mda.smartelectronix.com/drumsynth.htm)  though if you want to use Drumsynth on Windows 7 or Windows 10+, use the Oracle VM Virtualbox. There's a Windows XP virtual machine you can download and use to run Drumsynth properly. Make sure you use one of the older ones if you have a lower-end Windows 7 or 10+ machine or you won't be able to disable certain features that require something your graphics card just doesn't have.\n\nHere's the link for Oracle VM Virtualbox:  [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)  \\- It might seem intimidating at first but it is pretty easy to set up. Here are some instructions:  [https://helpdeskgeek.com/virtualization/how-to-set-up-a-windows-xp-virtual-machine-for-free/](https://helpdeskgeek.com/virtualization/how-to-set-up-a-windows-xp-virtual-machine-for-free/)  which include a download link for a virtual Windows XP: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002)\n\nAnd for some awesome free DAWs, you can get the Buzz tracker, Psycle tracker, Linux Multimedia Studio, Cakewalk, and Tracktion. Tracktion Free is basically just an old version that the creators have decided to make freely available. They can all host VST Plugins, and most have their own native plugin instruments and effects. The trackers Buzz and Psycle can be a bit tricky if you are starting out, but a lot of fun once you know how to use them. Others that I like include Darkwave Studio (since it stopped using the OpenCandy installer) and OpenMPT (Modplug Tracker). They also are VST hosts.\n\nEdit: Traction is apparently now called Waveform. Kind of confusing but still great interface - especially for something you can get free.\n\nIf you want a simple recording software, look for Audacity of course, but there are other multitracks you can download that might be better. Also look up \"The Sonic Spot\" on google on the wayback machine. It's a long-defunct music software download site, but it still has working links if you can find it. Great place to look for great stuff. If you have a taste for oldschool mixing programs, look in the internet archive for Tuareg, Tunafish, and Moonfish. Used Tuareg a lot back in the late 90's and early 2000s.\n\nA few extra links:\n\nSampleradar:  [https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/free-music-samples-royalty-free-loops-hits-and-multis-to-download](https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/free-music-samples-royalty-free-loops-hits-and-multis-to-download) a website with loops and one-shot samples you can download and use for free. No need to pay royalties - just don't reupload them to your site or try to sell them in a sample set and you'll be fine.\n\n2,000 Free Soundfonds:  [https://hiphopmakers.com/over-2000-free-soundfonts-free-soundfont-player](https://hiphopmakers.com/over-2000-free-soundfonts-free-soundfont-player)  it has links to a lot of useful websites for soundfonts and for soundfont (sf2) players.\n\nPolyphone Soundfont Editor:  [https://www.polyphone-soundfonts.com/](https://www.polyphone-soundfonts.com/)  make your own sf2 files\n\nMod Archive Downloads:  [https://modarchive.org/index.php?faq-torrents-current](https://modarchive.org/index.php?faq-torrents-current) Lots of song files and the TMA Waveworld collection - filled with drum and other instrument one-shots. Kiarchive Woolyss chiptune samples are also worth a look.\n\nDrawing and Painting:\n\nFor those who want to get into art and are tired of GIMP (which to be honest doesn't respond well to the mouse but is a good photoediting software) I would recommend Artrage and Medibang Pro. Both are free, and last time I checked you can get everything you need with the free version of the Medibang Pro tablet app. (About all you're paying for is more palettes, which you may not really need). They are very responsive to mouse and stylus movement, and both have options to allow you to draw smoother lineart. Pixia and Pierha aren't too bad either, and there is also the old version of openCanvas.\n\nOldschool artists will probably like Flying Colors and Deluxe Paint 2. Flying Colors is an old Windows 95 256 colour program while Deluxe Paint 2 is a Dos program so you will need DOSBox.\n\nFor vector pics, Inkscape is probably your best bet right now. It's not the best vector editor around, but it's free and you can make some very good pictures with it. Heck, if you are skilled enough, you can make professional-quality pictures in MSPaint.",

If you look carefully, you may find universities willing to take an edX certificate since it is a port of a class from an actual accredited school, but the value of edX is for resume building and personal growth, not getting a diploma.\n\nedit: As /u/kibaeatstrash pointed out, they do offer some individual courses that carry the accreditation from the original university, and if you're just looking for a few credits, that can serve your purpose. It's only for those specific courses though, not the whole site.",

Subreddits for languages oftentimes have their own discord servers.\n\n\u2022 Google Chrome has several extensions that will translate phrases for you, teach you new words, etc. without any extra effort. You\u2019re practically learning a language every time you use the internet. (Edit: Gloss, Kypsis, and Langulearn are good ones!)\n\n\u2022 If there\u2019s a popular public domain book in English, chances are, it\u2019s been translated and is in public domain in other languages. Usually when learning a language, I\u2019ll try to be able to read The Little Prince by the end of my first year of learning\u2014which isn\u2019t public domain everywhere but is still easy to find, never too expensive, and usually easy to read.",

It's better than taking the classes from your university professor. \n\nI am good at math, but I struggled in the university setting. I found myself learning all the material 2 weeks late. The lectures were to a class of 150-300 people, and their was almost always a language barrier preventing me from fully grasping the content until AFTER the test. When I was having difficulty in Calc III due to my heavily accented Russian professor who was only teaching the class because he had a minimum quota of classes to teach each year to stay employed for his research in number theory, my Teaching assistant helped a bit, but not enough.\n\nI found MIT open courseware, and although the teacher had a minor German accent, he wanted to teach. It made a world of difference, and if I missed anything, I could rewind 20 seconds and hear it again. Most importantly, these teachers are absolutely amazing at giving you what you need. The MIT staff are not there because they are super smart, (although they might also be that) but instead because they are the best teachers. I'm convinced anyone who wants to learn can from them.\n\nAfter that successful turning around of a grade, I used it again for Differential Equations and Linear Algebra. I Aced (100%) both finals for diffEQ and Linear algebra, despite being a C student for most of the semesters in the classes. My only regret is not watching each lecture during the semester, instead of all in a row before the Finals.\n\nTL;DR: you are almost better off watching the MIT open courseware lectures with headphones on a laptop while attending your math classes at a large University than paying attention to your professors.",

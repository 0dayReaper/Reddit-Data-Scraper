They don't see the issues of the modern world because they are so far detached from the modern world. Once they retire/die and governments begin to be filled with people that have experienced more of the modern world and are aware of the modern issues then we will start to see change occur. Best example is the prevelance of gambling mechanics in video games that are rated safe for children, how are these 70+ year old people supposed to know about stuff like that when they have never touched a video game in their life.",

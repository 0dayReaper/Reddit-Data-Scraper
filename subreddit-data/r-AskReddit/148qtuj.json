            "comment": "You have to practice an instrument every day to be good  \n\n\nNo you dont  \nYou can intially start out with intense practice sessions but once youve learned a decent amount of stuff and know what you're doing and kinda commit those actions and shapes to muscle memory, you can easily pick it up twice a week and maintain your level of playing   \n\n\nNow, if you wanna be an instrument GREAT, maybe a studio musician or being in a band or whatever, thats where heavy practice has it's place. And no, I'm not talking about \"Shredding\", 90% of metal solos just sound like complete wankery. Who needs melody or clear transitions from note to note or character when you can try and make your guitar cum with the most mind numbing, structureless, almost tone deaf bullshit you'll ever hear. Sorry metal heads, your genres are bad and your guitar players just wanna swing their dicks around. Except black metal, and I'd love to debate that with some of you metal heads out there.   \n\n\nWhat I mean by \"GREAT\" is being a classical guitarist. Because with this path, you can play an ENTIRE SONG ON ONE INSTRUMENT, and not just the classical music but whatever you want! Theres so much tabs and things out there for you to learn popular songs with classical arrangements to impress your friends by a camp fire like the normie bastard you are.   \nIf you want to see examples, just go to youtube and type \"(Enter song name here) classical guitar edition\" or \"(Song name) fingerstyle\", its beautiful stuff and the arrangements are hard as fuck sometimes but very full sounding and complete. You dont need a single other musician, a one man band with just a guitar, thats fucking talent.\n\nBut anyway, I feel the main goal of being a musician is to make a full song so I really dont know why someone would put it all into one instrument and instead create an array of their own songs, thought out and composed ya know? Being remembered for playing an alright solo in a song is cool, but being the guy working on a huge arrangement is far more impressive in my opinion.  \n\n\nTL;DR  \nDon't make music, ever  \nBad rabbit hole  \nAnyone wanna try and get me out",

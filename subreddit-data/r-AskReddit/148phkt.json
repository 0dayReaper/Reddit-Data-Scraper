I worked in that field for much of my adult life, and I truly loved being a group home manager and working with the residents, who were like my children. Left over some personal drama that happened at work and because the pay was crap. I work a well paying job now, and I enjoy what I do, but I'm not passionate about it like when I was in the group home with my guys. I truly enjoyed going into work everyday and would love to do that again... if I didn't need money to survive.",

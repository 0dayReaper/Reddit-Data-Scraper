I was doing what my sister that died wanted me to about staying at the hospital and such. That is the only thing I can come up with. I tried for over six months to get into contact with her but it was not happening. Now 21 years later we still have never seen or spoken to each other.",

I told her I needed some space to process this, and she told me to never talk to me again, that she will make sure my sister tells me when she dies. \n\nShe also bailed on me while I was in labor after basically demanding to be in the delivery room, so that was cool too.",

But about a year ago I watched a video on energy vampires and most of the symptoms were sadly true for him from everyone being mentally drained when he is around to him talking mostly about himself but not being interested in anyone for more then a minute or two. So yeah, I mean I find this extremely sad that I have to avoid my father, but otherwise he just fcking me up mentally and I can't even try to seek professional help, cuz he would just double down on me like he is perfectly fine and I need therapy (there were some similar examples before, so thats why Im so sure about it).",

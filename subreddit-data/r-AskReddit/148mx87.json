Oh no let me walk at a slightly faster pace and survive a few months so that the zombies all rot away and lose the ability to move \n\n\nWorld War Z? Fucked\n\n\nDead space? Fucked\n\n\nHalo Flood? Fucked\n\n\nResident evil? Get as far away from the area as possible before it\u2019s either A Nuked, or B leveled in some other way\n\n\nDying Light? Idk it\u2019s a toss up depending on where I am at the time",

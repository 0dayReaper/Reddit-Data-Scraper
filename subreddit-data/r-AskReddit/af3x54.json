The patient was borderline impossible to save. From the article:\n\n&gt; Here, we see Dr. Zbigniew Religa keeping watch on the vital signs of a patient after a 23 hour heart surgery he conducted. In the lower right corner, you can see one of his colleagues who helped him with the surgery fallen asleep. Dr. Religa was a pioneer of heart transplantation in Poland, and even though the surgery was considered borderline impossible at the time, he took the chance, and the operation was entirely successful. Today, even though Dr. Religa\u2019s heart has stopped beating, the one of his patient is still running.",

The prisoner was caught cutting the throats of a South Vietnamese officer and his family, who were close friends of General Nguyen, and the general shot him in vengeance. Eddie Adams, the photographer, even said \"photos are only half-truths\" and that they don't always explain the events that led to the moment.

They then managed to smuggle the film out of the camp in a tube of toothpaste.\n\nFor me it is one of the most horrifying photos in existence and just shows what humans are capable of at their worst.",

The contrast between the worn riot shield in one of his hands and the cross in the other, along with his religious garb against his respirator is something I found incredibly powerful. A friend of mine likened him to a real life paladin - there's something so battle hardened about the look in his eyes.",

You know a photo is great when it really makes you feel the pain of someone who lived over a hundred years ago. Maybe it\u2019s because you can really see the detail of this person. It\u2019s just so *real*. This was real, god how incredibly tragic.",

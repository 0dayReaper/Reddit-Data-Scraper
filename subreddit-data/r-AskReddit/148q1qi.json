Meanwhile, 44% said they only learned very basic computing skills. These results are particularly surprising given that Gen Z is the first generation to grow up fully immersed in computers and phones.](https://www.fastcompany.com/90859083/gen-z-tech-skills-gap-dell-study)",

Example: I went to a conference on internet safety when I was 19 and most of the people there were boomers. They refused to listen to me when I talked about social media use in young people despite me evidently being a young person who used social media because they were, idk, a parent or a teacher or something. And would not hear the \u201clook your kids aren\u2019t telling you everything\u201d line either. Lol",

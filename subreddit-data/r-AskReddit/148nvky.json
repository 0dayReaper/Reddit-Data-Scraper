(I do not know if they were rich or not, they said they were) They kept trying to look at my tests (I was pretty intelligent then, I usually got 95-100 on tests) and even outside of that she was always annoying. I was glad she had to move. The one thing I remember about her that she traded off a hand-woven bracelet from her grandma for a toy. When her grandma dies, what are you gonna remember her by? It didn't hurt me directly, but I felt bad for her grandma because she just pawned that off. What if she spent like an hour on that? Still hurts to think about to this day.",

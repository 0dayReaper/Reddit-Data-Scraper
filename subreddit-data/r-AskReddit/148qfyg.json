You don\u2019t necessary need to learn, but it\u2019s a HUGE help and it\u2019s always better to learn earlier. I didn\u2019t hurt anyone or anything, what was the big deal? How can he expect me to learn or fix my mistake without practice. That\u2019s the whole point of \u201cpractice\u201d.",

Im about to get my permit just need to have time free. So apart from that i been telling my dad to let me practice (before i paid for the profesional lessons), and now that i\u2019ve already completed them we went on a empty street. He gave me his truck and on a right turn i went slightly too fast and he said to get off and just get in the back. Didn\u2019t even practice less than a minute, now he\u2019s saying if i want to learn to go elsewhere. As for my mom she can\u2019t drive herself nor has a vehicle. What should i do in this situation?",

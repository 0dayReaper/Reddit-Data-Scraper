You don\u2019t necessary need to learn, but it\u2019s a HUGE help and it\u2019s always better to learn earlier. I didn\u2019t hurt anyone or anything, what was the big deal? How can he expect me to learn or fix my mistake without practice. That\u2019s the whole point of \u201cpractice\u201d.",

Im about to get my permit just need to have time free. So apart from that i been telling my dad to let me practice (before i paid for the profesional lessons), and now that i\u2019ve already completed them we went on a empty street. He gave me his truck and on a right turn i went slightly too fast and he said to get off and just get in the back. Didn\u2019t even practice less than a minute, now he\u2019s saying if i want to learn to go elsewhere. As for my mom she can\u2019t drive herself nor has a vehicle. What should i do in this situation?",

I understand how it\u2019s really stressful for parents, but it\u2019s almost a necessary skill if you don\u2019t live somewhere walkable. do you have any extended family or friends you could practice with? or maybe talk to your parents about trying again and taking it slow and cautious",

I\u2019m just tired of walking 50 minutes from school and back, as i already leave late so i get home almost at 5 and i go straight to work then back and i don\u2019t have much time for else, the only good thing is that my job is 5 minutes away from my house.  And for  my dad i wouldn\u2019t say conservative but he\u2019s very impatient and loud, i already tried talking to him and he said no. When i was practicing for those 30 seconds he kept screaming slow down slow down, even tho i was already like 20mph, note that i already have practiced i really don\u2019t understand why he was so worried.",

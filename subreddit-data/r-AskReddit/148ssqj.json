He just started listing off qualifications for being what he deemed a good choice for a boyfriend. Like \"I have a job, I'm close with my family, I have goals, I treat women right, etc\". \n\nIt took me a fucking while to realize he was trying to hit on me and not practice for an interview or some shit, and when I made it clear I wasn't interested he got so mad and was like \"I'd make a perfect boyfriend! I have no idea why you wouldn't be interested! Just come to this game with me and you'll see I'm absolutely perfect for you!\" \n\nHe was borderline having a temper tantrum and so my friend thankfully picked up on his anger and stepped in and said something like \"our friend over here needs your help\" so I could leave. \n\nStill wondering if he's murdered anyone yet",

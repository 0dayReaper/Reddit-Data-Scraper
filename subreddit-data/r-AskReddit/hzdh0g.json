            "comment": "Back when I was 10 there was a competition for schoolkids to write a treatment for an episode of Doctor Who, with the best one being developed into an full episode in the next series and the winner receiving a writing credit. I was a huge fan of DW at the time and the competition was actually run through schools, so my teacher made the entire class do it, but I was very excited.\n\nI began writing a story about the Doctor landing on a planet full of defective cybermen, who's programming had gone a wry and had been left on this asylum planet to rot. The Doctor lands there in response to a mysterious distress call from a woman and attempts to find and save her while avoiding the dangerous dysfunctional cybermen and the looming threat of planetary destruction at the hands of the normal cybermen. I finished my short treatment and gave it to my teacher to submit. Unfortunately it turned out the competition was very strict about the formatting of submissions and mine was returned because I had used the wrong formatting in some way, it seemed like a weird reason. I was a bit disappointed and that was the end of that.\n\nBut then, a year or two later, there was an episode of DW called Asylum of the Daleks, which seemed incredibly similar to my story except with Daleks. So incredibly, eerily, similar in fact, that to this day I am absolutely convinced that Steven Moffat saw my script and came up with a formatting excuse so that he could remove me from the competition, steal my story, change the bad guys and claim it as his own. I have zero evidence, I don't even still have the treatment I wrote, or any letter from the BBC about my submission, and yet I know in my bones that Steven Moffat stole his script from 10 yr old me.",

I was and still am a huge rpg fan and it\u2019s the height of my geekdom. Well, I sent in a picture of me and my tattoo with a short letter about me and my favorite games to Official PlayStation Magazine. They published my letter and photo along with the caption \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether to be impressed or frightened.\u201d\n\nThe very next month they started a \u201cTattoo of the Month\u201d section and I am absolutely sure 100% that I either started that or was the story that proved the concept, the test.  Unless someone can come from that team\u2019s time and tell me I\u2019m not, I\u2019ll always believe I was the start of that.\n\nEdit: [HERE](https://i.imgur.com/TWPFn2G.jpg) is a current pic of the tat, I looked for several hours to try and find the original that I sent in, I thought I had it saved but I guess it\u2019s lost forever, sorry everyone",

During the hijacking, which was at 9:28 AM (maybe a 9:30 class?) during the takeover it was very jerky and lost a lot of altitude, and it took a while for the hijackers to stabilize it and get it under control and turn it around.\n\nEdit: if you look at the track of Flight 93 it likely would have been visible from the Kent State campus on its westward path. On its post-hijack return flight it passed farther south, over the top of West Virginia.",

            "comment": "I'm quietly convinced I made a bestselling mystery novelist change the way he writes because I criticised him on Reddit.\n\nThe novelist in question is Chris Carter; the books are the [Robert Hunter](https://www.goodreads.com/series/67232-robert-hunter) series. (Yes, the guy who has built a career on looking for serial killers is named Hunter. He works for the LAPD's Ultra-Violent Crime Unit. It's not a series that's overburdened by subtlety, is what I'm saying.) They are as schlocky a bunch of thrillers as you could ever hope to find, but for some reason I can't get enough of them, despite the fact that they're... very much not great. They lean pretty damn heavy on ridiculous tropes, and I've never seen a more Mary Sue lead than I have in this series, but the biggest complaint I have with them is that the same line appears almost literally word for word in the first nine books. I [made a comment about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/al2fp8/who_is_your_favorite_terrible_author/) on Reddit on an /r/books thread about your favourite terrible authors, and I went back through all of the books published so far just to prove my point:\n\n&gt;***The Crucifix Killer:*** The famous line doesn't actually appear in this book as far as I could find, but Hunter *does* drink Scotch near-constantly as the defining trait of his character. 'Across the room a stylish glass bar looked totally out of place. It was the only piece of furniture Hunter had purchased brand new and from a trendy shop. It held several bottles of Hunter\u2019s biggest passion \u2013 single malt Scotch whisky. The bottles were arranged in a peculiar way that only he understood.' And so it begins.\n\n&gt;***The Executioner***: 'Single-malt Scotch whiskey was Hunter\u2019s biggest passion. But **unlike most people, he knew how to appreciate it instead of simply getting drunk on it.**' Note that in this one and the next Carter doesn't even use the Scottish spelling ('whisky', rather than 'whiskey'), despite the fact that this is *literally Hunter's only character trait*.\n\n&gt;***The Night Stalker***: 'Hunter\u2019s biggest passion was single malt Scotch whiskey, but **unlike most, he knew how to appreciate its flavor and quality instead of simply getting drunk on it.'**\n\n&gt;***The Death Sculptor***: 'Hunter sat at the bar and ordered a double dose of 12-year-old GlenDronach with two cubes of ice. Single-malt Scotch whisky was his biggest passion, and though he had overdone it a few times **he knew how to appreciate its flavor and quality instead of simply getting drunk on it.**'\n\n&gt;***The Hunter***: 'Hunter\u2019s father had a passion for single malt Scotch whisky. A passion that, frankly, Hunter had never understood. He found whisky, any type of whisky, way too overwhelming for his palate.' (I actually quite like this one; it's a prequel novella, so this one is a nice little meta throwback. It gets a pass from me.)\n\n&gt;***One By One***: 'Hunter would never consider himself an expert, but **he knew how to appreciate the flavor and robustness of single malts, instead of simply getting hammered on them.** Though, sometimes, getting hammered worked just fine.' This is also the first appearance of the '... but sometimes getting drunk works just fine, am I right?' addendum. It's nice to see Carter branching out a little, but after this he never looks back.\n\n&gt;***An Evil Mind***: 'Single-malt Scotch whisky was Hunter\u2019s biggest passion. Unlike so many, **he knew how to appreciate its palate instead of just getting drunk on it.** Though sometimes getting drunk worked just fine.'\n\n&gt;***I Am Death***: 'Back in the living room, wrapped in a white towel, Hunter switched on a floor lamp and dimmed its intensity to \u2018medium\u2019. That done, he approached his drinks cabinet, which was small but held an impressive collection of single malt Scotch whisky, which was probably his biggest passion. Though he had overdone it a few times, **Hunter sure knew how to appreciate the flavor and quality of a good single malt, instead of simply getting drunk on it.**'\n\n&gt;***The Caller***: 'Hunter\u2019s biggest passion was single malt Scotch whisky. Back in his apartment, tucked in a corner of his living room, an old-fashioned drinks cabinet held a small but impressive collection of single malts that would probably satisfy the palate of most connoisseurs. Hunter would never consider himself an expert on whisky but, unlike so many, **he at least knew how to appreciate its flavor and quality, instead of simply getting drunk on it**, though sometimes getting drunk worked just fine.' *The Caller* also gets double points for helpfully informing us that women just don't *get* the subtle nuances of Scotch: 'Hunter tried not to frown at her again, but he was sincerely intrigued. Women in general weren\u2019t very fond of Scotch whisky, which wasn\u2019t at all surprising. Whisky was undoubtedly an acquired taste, one that at first would certainly overpower anyone\u2019s palate and knock the air out of their lungs in the process. Hunter knew that only too well. The trick was to persist, to keep trying, to keep sipping it until one day it finally made sense. Women usually weren\u2019t that patient with drinks. They either liked it at first sip or they didn\u2019t.' This, by the by, is how we know that the woman in question is trustworthy, because... reasons?\n\n&gt;***Gallery of the Dead***: 'Back in his apartment, Hunter had a small but impressive collection of Scotch that would probably satisfy the palate of most connoisseurs. He would never consider himself an expert, but unlike so many of his friends, who also claimed to enjoy single malt Scotch whisky, **he knew how to appreciate the flavors and robustness of the malts, instead of simply getting drunk on them**. Though sometimes getting drunk worked just fine.'\n\nThat post was made in January of 2019; in April, his book *Hunting Evil* came out, and the line was nowhere to be seen. I didn't think much of it until his new book, *Written in Blood*, came out a few days ago, and also didn't have the line in it. This comment is also one of the top answers if [you google his name and the book series via Reddit](https://www.google.com/search?ei=4i0gX5zqLofCgQaovovgBA&amp;q=chris+carter+robert+hunter+reddit&amp;oq=chris+carter+robert+hunter+reddit&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoFCAAQsAM6BAgAEA1Q_SpY6T9gsEFoAXAAeACAAW2IAccIkgEEMTIuMZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic46WhjPDqAhUHYcAKHSjfAkwQ4dUDCAs&amp;uact=5) -- exactly what you'd do if you were looking to see if people on the internet were talking about your books. I also can't find [any evidence of anyone else pointing this out in a review or suchlike](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;ei=6oAgX8euJMKT8gKbrp3YBA&amp;q=%22chris+carter%22+scotch+%22robert+hunter%22&amp;oq=%22chris+carter%22+scotch+%22robert+hunter%22&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIICCEQFhAdEB4yCAghEBYQHRAeMggIIRAWEB0QHjIICCEQFhAdEB4yCAghEBYQHRAeMggIIRAWEB0QHjIICCEQFhAdEB46BwgAELADEB46BggAEBYQHjoFCCEQoAE6BAghEBVQ2hdYrjpggD5oAXAAeACAAYkBiAH3C5IBBDEyLjSYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6wAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHy-642_DqAhXCiVwKHRtXB0sQ4dUDCAs&amp;uact=5).\n\nSo yeah... in short, three months after I made that comment, he broke the habit of a decade of writing and finally decided that after *nine stories* that used this as a crutch for Hunter's personality, it was too much.\n\nI know you're reading this, Chris. *I know.*",

It's The Expanse's \"he knew how to appreciate its flavor and quality instead of simply getting drunk on it.\"  \n  \nSome books even have the same explanation twice, once in the start of the book and once later in the book, just in case you forgot. Why do they keep repeating this in book 5 for fuck's sake? Who has made it this far in the series and not understood this, not remembered it being explained 10 times already? Sometimes it's mentioned seemingly out of nowhere, when it's not even relevant for the plot or what's happening.  \n  \nThis particular example is the one that bothers me most, but there's tons of little \"why do they write like this\" moments that make me facepalm myself while reading that series (again, despite how much I love the series overall).",

Ever seen what a blobfish is supposed to look like at the depth it's supposed to live at? It gets all fucked up when it gets brought to the surface because of the water pressure differential. See also: giant squids. One of the only reasons we know they exist is because they die and float up here, or are very close to death and can't maintain proper boyancy. They don't want to be up here, they prefer the crushing blackness.",

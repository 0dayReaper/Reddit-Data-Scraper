In June!\n\nOn the last day we topped out at 117F at around 2:30.  The previous two days the max temp had been at around 4:30, so we were looking to hit around 121F.  Luckily the heat dome itself moved or kind of started breaking down around 2 PM and that allowed the temps to drop.  I'm not sure if I could have handled 121F with my crappy little AC cranked on max when it was 117F and my room feeling like a sauna nonetheless.\n\nI strongly believe that if the entire country had suffered through those few days, there no longer would be any bogus \"debate\" about global warming.",

I think the highest ever recorded temp is like 130 something. It was a little breezy that day, it felt like someone was blowing my entire body with a hair dryer. I bought a carton of eggs on the way there cuz I wanted to find out if you could fry an egg on pavement- you can. The crazy thing was there was a bunch off old eggs in the parking lot- other people had the same idea lol. \n\nI also got some cold beers and put them in the cooler, I thought it would be awesome to have an ice cold beer in one of the hottest temps ever recorded. I drank a few and got wayyy too tipsy to drive so I had to sit around and sober up. I think maybe the heat made it affect me more. I sat in the freaking parking lot until 9 pm- and it was still 119 degrees. I felt like I was going to die. It was miserable. Finally I felt sober enough and drove the hell out of there and to higher elevation until it was cool enough I could sleep and then I just passed out on the side of the road in my truck lol.",

Overall wasn't as bad as 116 in places like El Paso, where the sun is just a lot fiercer. 113 in El Paso feels hotter and you'll dehydrate there quicker. And it was much better than 113 in a place like Austin, b/c of the lack of humidity and the hotter sun. \n\nLike a 113 day in Texas will burn plant leaves and stuff and you'll get a sunburn pretty quick and feel worn down. 116 in Portland is unpleasant and it will kill your plants b/c they're not used to it.

I was visiting my grandma for a week, and I had to wake up early in the morning at dawn to be able to work in the garden without passing out from heat exhaustion. As soon as it was between 9-10 AM, the work for the day was over, as it was too fucking hot to do anything outside, even to walk from the house to the barn. Just after sunset, I went back out to finish whatever work in the garden I could while light was still out, as after that I'd get swarmed by mosquitoes if I had a head lamp. \n\nThe land was incredibly dry. Getting to the shop for a bottle of water was nearly impossible without an umbrella, and even then, I had to have a wet towel on my head at all times. \n\nThe only worse summer they had since then was last year when the entire area (and even the entire county if I'm not mistaken) literally ran out of water. Everyone smelled like shit, most of the gardens where people grew their vegetables dried out, and government had to provide them water tanks just so that the animals that people had wouldn't die from thirst. Those who could moved away to live with their families that weren't affected by the drought for a couple of weeks.\n\nAnd just at the peak of this season, the second biggest fucking storm the village had ever seen came, nearly flooded quarter of it, a tree took down the electric pole that was their only source of electricity, and people still didn't have water because their wells and water tanks were turned off so that they would save money on electricity. So, when they finally had the water, but they didn't have the electricity.",

Idk if you've ever had the unique experience of hand unloading an 18 wheeler full of humid plants in the middle of July....\n\nTakes about 3 hours, and it is a different kind of hot. You had to slam your arms down every run to sheath the sweat off so you can grip the next round of plants. It's so fucking hot you can't feel the hundreds of fire ants biting you.\n\nThe shit I did for $14 an hour.",

Was working at Lowe\u2019s in lumber at the time and going outside just felt like you were gonna instantly sweat to death. The air felt thick and scorching hot",

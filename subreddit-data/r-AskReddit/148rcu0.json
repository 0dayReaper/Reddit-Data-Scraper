            "comment": "I have really bad gym anxiety and how I deal with it (I travel a lot) is that I do things in steps. I go first to the gym to get setup and I ask for a tour. That helps to orientate a person and make sure to ask questions about things like busy times, how things work, things to be aware and so forth.\n\nThen I go to the gym for the first time to train and I do only thing. I choose something I'm super comfortable with (i.e. running, cycling) and I do that for 30 minutes. I also don't race or anything. I go nice and slow. The point is to go through the motions of getting your gym clothing together, drive/walk to the gym, go through the entry and get setup to train.\n\nWhile I am running or cycling (cycling is easier when doing this) I take time to notice how people move around the gym. How do people negotiate for sharing equipment, where do they put their gear, how do they go about doing things. This helps answer questions on what are the unspoken social rules.\n\nThen when I go back, I choose a small set of exercises using equipment that's easier to use. I grab some dumb bells and run through a few sets. And that's where I start. By the time you get to your third week, it starts to feel much easier.\n\nExtra tip: ask the folks at the front when the gym is at it's quietest and start there if that helps.\n\nEdit: fixed some spelling",

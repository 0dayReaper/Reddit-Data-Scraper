It\u2019ll creep up on you, and one day you\u2019ll realise that you\u2019re just so fed up and tired of everything. You dread going to work the next day, and you struggle to get anything done. You also develop a short fuse, so tend to get into more disagreements.",

Your entire time at work is thinking about whats going to happen when you finally get to leave.  And when you leave work you still have it in the back of your mind because you have to go do it again tomorrow.  \n\nSunday night (for M-F jobs) is the worst.  You have plenty of time before going back but all you are doing is dreading going back.",

I went from bubbly, overly caring, and talking to the people I care for to having a tinge of dislike every time they talked or asked me for anything. Went from doing everything I could to just doing what had to be done and walking away. There are days where I sit and just stare at the wall and zone out until my shift is over.",

I DO NOT believe  that anyone genuinely believes the world is flat.  It's just attention seeking.",

Something that's flat doesn't have to have an edge, it can just be an [infinite plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_\\(mathematics\\))\n\nIn case it's not entirely obvious, this is all said with sarcasm aplenty; but there is truth to my statement too, its just naive to believe just because something is flat that it must necessarily end...",

If there is one thing flat earther's proven they enjoy, its controversial ideas; you really think there isn't one that doesn't believe in 'an edge' just because the media presents them that way.",

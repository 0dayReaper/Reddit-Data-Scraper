There's a shortage of natural sand, because it's the cheapest and most widely available, but there are plenty of alternatives (crushed stone is the main one). They're just more expensive. The bigger issue is that sand mining is largely unregulated and tends to destroy natural habitats.\n\nAlso, the reason we're \"running out of sand\" is because construction sand needs to be coarsely grained in order to provide structural support. Sand found on beaches and in the desert has been eroded into smooth grains and can't be used for this purpose.",

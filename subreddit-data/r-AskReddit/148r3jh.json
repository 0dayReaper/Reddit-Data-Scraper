            "comment": "Had a weird experience at Borley Rectory a few years back. Google it if you haven't heard of it. Was just an autumn afternoon, i just drove there as i was nearby for a works meeting. Old lady appeared from nowhere shouting at me about \"no ghosts here\" etc. There was no one around when i pulled up in car, and within seconds she was banging on my window. She was not very nice. The nearest houses were at least 50yards away, no way did she come out of one of them and got to my car window in literally 7 seconds. I still to this day wonder if she was real..",

The night shifts were long and you'd sit in a darkened corridor on high alert for any children that could wake up and then need safeguarding or for the ones with cot sides on their beds who could perhaps have a seizure.\nWe would perform periodic checks on these kids especially the more vulnerable ones. \nA coworker told me that one night she had gone to check on one such vulnerable child who was severely disabled and prone to seizures.\nIt was winter time and the rooms were a little on the cold side as this was an old building that we were due to move out of soon.\nWhen she got to the door of the room she was surprised to see it was closed as we usually left doors slightly open to be able to hear any activity.\nThen she tried the handle.\nIt would not turn so she tried again using all her strength and the door swung open.\nWhat she described as a blast of hot air hit her and there on the floor was the child, sitting and laughing at her.\nThe cot sides of the bed were still up and this child was not physically able to stand or walk.",

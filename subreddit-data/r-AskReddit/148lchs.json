            "comment": "In my country if you use the official app of the biggest cineman chain, you can select up to 15 seats for a single transaction. I\u2019ve figured out that if you stop short of paying then for 30 mins the seats are reserved because the session for the transaction is busy counting down toward a timeout. So once I book my seats, I select the seats around me and then just never pay. Repeat once or twice and you can reserve those seats up until the movie starts. If people were not such inconsiderate, selfish and narcissistic c*nts in the cinema with their phones and talking throughout the movie and crap, then this wouldn\u2019t be necessary. But they are and so they can get rekt, including the cinema chain who never enforces any sort of rules to protect paying customers from being disturbed by people who have no respect.",

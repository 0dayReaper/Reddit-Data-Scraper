Maybe mines being a good husband, dog dad, and friend? Being open minded and trying new things? \n\nA lot of my life goals have been accomplished. Although, I have been feeling burnt out from one of my hobbies lately, so I\u2019ve been reflecting and trying to change my perspective on that. Maybe I just need some time to veg out and play games. \n\nDon\u2019t really know though. Feel like as I\u2019m getting older, being a good friend is hard. Making new friends is even harder. My passion for hobbies is fleeting and comes in waves. This life thing is weird.",

You can't experience the totality of existence without having some bad.\n\nI'm sure I'll choose to be a Rockefeller, and I'll also choose to be a tortured prisoner of war who gets executed because I'll want to experience the pain the soul can endure and keep fighting. The terrifying feeling of impending death is as valid an experience as taking a flight to Paris just for pizza.",

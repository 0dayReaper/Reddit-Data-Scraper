For each user on the site?  \n\n(But not the Recently Viewed Links, because we already have that feature and it works.)\n\nOn a site that doesn't have decent video or image hosting, that doesn't have decent mobile viewing options, and split the user experience between what was stable, but old, and the Redesign, which was supposed to be better looking and is just weird.\n\nAnd then there's the chat features and the live streaming and all the other stuff they keep bolting onto the site.\n\nHeck, even the mod tools haven't been seriously updated to keep pace with the size of the site. Mods of larger subreddits have to use third party stuff just to help keep track of things in their modqueues.\n\nInstead of adding all these new features, can we not just take user feedback, roll out one, standard reddit that actually plays properly with the official mobile app, one that is stable and is designed to load swiftly, and one that gives mods the tools they need to help mod a site this big?",

If you have the chance to hang out with friends, take it. They might move away eventually. Call your parents. Get more sleep.

For context, I'm in my late 20's, so not exactly a wise sage. \n\nTo clarify, I wasn't trying to imply anything about people not knowing what they're doing in their careers and/or skills. What I mean is that everyone struggles navigating through various aspects of life and the \"secret\", for me at least, has been to just focus on doing the best I can and not using other people's success or failures as a barometer for my own life. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses; I think you just have to piece together what you've got and take a crack at it.",

If you don't know what you want hit community college, talk to every girl/guy you have any interest in, TAKE HELP, no one does it by themselves. Family and friends willing to help aren't trying to hold it over you they want you to succeed! That's the biggest thing I've learned. Help doesn't make you weak or dumb it means you have a support system, don't run away from it. Every successful person had help. Don't ever believe the BS selfmade stories. Take help never push it away. Hope you do well. Happy 2020",

I'd like to go to school for something else but I just dont think its realistic at this point and it is very depressing.",

Just about had it onto the table when the other guy lets go and it drags me down, full force into the ground. Pulled a muscle in my upper back and herniated a disc. Took about 7 years to start to feel ANY better from that ( was able to work starting about 3-4 years after the original injury, albeit with serious pain flare ups).  Had bi-lateral tingling/stinging sensation down both of my arms, and a feeling that could only be described as a flat head screw driver being driven between my shoulder blades.\n\nI am so glad I'm doing better from that now.. though now I have a different herniated disc and have been diagnosed with stenosis, the compounding of which severely limits my mobility. So nothing is perfect, but i've already been through one round of chronic pain, what's round 2? At least this feels a little more passively forgiving (the screw-driver pain was enough to induce suicidal idealization) . If i could get those 10 years back i'd treat my body a lot better.  \n\n\nEDIT- Thanks for the karma and awards guys! Didn't expect my first to be recounting my old injury. I hope you all have a blessed and happy new year!",

Then I realized the old adage \u2018the best time to plan a tree is 8 years ago, the second best time is today\u2019 is way too true. \n\nDon\u2019t set timelines expected by others - follow your own path and enjoy the ride.

We all want to be the best parent, feed them healthy foods, never introduce them to sugar, be constantly attentive and encouraging, teach them everything possible. We want to be the parent who produces the above average children who are well adjusted, educated, don\u2019t know what refined sugar even looks like, and hasn\u2019t been exposed to a screen yet. \n\nEvery parent wants to do this. But then a trip to grandma\u2019s results in an Oreo obsession. You\u2019re tired and after working overtime and everyone gets  happy meals that night. You\u2019re waiting in a long line with a grumpy two year old and just want to make it out of there with the least amount of judgmental stares so you put on YouTube with Elmo dancing to distract him for the next 15 minutes and it works like a charm. You get distracted talking to the neighbor while your kids are napping and when you come inside one of the assholes managed to get the bottle of mustard off the fridge door and now everything including the dog is covered in mustard. You\u2019ll go to the park and one of your kids will yell \u201cMom! That man has no eyes!\u201d when the blind guy who doesn\u2019t wear sunglasses and lives two doors down from you walks by and you\u2019ll want the ground to swallow you. \n\nAnd you\u2019ll feel like you failed them every single time you look back and realize you weren\u2019t as attentive or as strict as you should have been and didn\u2019t teach them the things you swore you would. Your seven year old will drop an F bomb in front of your religious mother in law. Your oldest will get sassy and think they know everything and you will want to kill them. You will wonder how the youngest is still alive because you definitely aren\u2019t as invested in this one\u2019s mortality as you were the first, since now you know they really can fall face down off the bed and bounce a bit. \n\nJust don\u2019t be too hard on yourself, is all I\u2019m getting at.\n\nEdit: Never sign up for a Facebook parenting group either.",

I could save myself from cheating boyfriends, a job that almost killed me with stress, and the spiral of alcoholism, depression, and other untreated mental illnesses that followed it all. I could save myself a lot.\n\nBut I still don\u2019t know where the past 8 years are taking me. I\u2019m still healing from them, and I\u2019m one of those types that learns the most from suffering, I guess. I wouldn\u2019t want to answer yes to this without knowing who the next version of me is. Maybe I\u2019m better for all this. I like to think I already am.\n\nSo thank you, Spirit of New Year\u2019s Past. I suppose I\u2019ll pass on that offer.",

Not to mention the state is beautiful and each city has its own unique character. On the other hand, the state is super expensive. I would love to live in San Francisco again, but I would need a couple roommates if I wanted to rent anything ok.\n\nWhen I tell people I'm from California, it can be interesting. If I'm in a region that's traditionally conservative/Pro-Trump, people will automatically assume I'm a liberal, pro-socialist or just drop conversation with me all together even though, while I lean left in a lot of issues, I don't lean far enough left to be considered a \"bleeding heart liberal\". On the flip side, other people assume every person in California lives by the beach and goes surfing all the time. Not to mention, many people don't grasp how long the state is so I have to explain to people that if they want to visit San Francisco and LA in one trip, they're going to have to buy two airplane tickets or be fine with a 5-6 hour road trip. I live smack dab in the middle of the state and live closer to San Diego than the Oregon border",

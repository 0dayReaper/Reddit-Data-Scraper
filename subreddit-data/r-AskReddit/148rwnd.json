Jean (Jason Schwartzmann), is a poor replacement for Gustave, who was a perfect gentleman and taught Zero to be the same. Gustave belongs to a group of concierges called the Society of Crossed Keys (named for a Zweig book), whose mission is preserving the traditions of good manners. Their efforts, however, mean little in the end. In his last conversation with the Author, Zero laments, \"I think [Gustave's] world had vanished long before he ever entered it.\"*\n https://www.slashfilm.com/1067683/the-grand-budapest-hotel-ending-explained-an-enchanting-old-ruin/\n\nyeah, it isn't the first film to reflect on how the rise of fascism and WWII changed the world. life and death of colonel blimp was reflecting on that while it was happening.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_and_Death_of_Colonel_Blimp",

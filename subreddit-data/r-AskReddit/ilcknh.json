I used to pull this on a regular basis with different places. Once in the park pulling the same ole shit, I saw this boy trying to be cool jumping off the fence. His pants got stuck while he hung upside down with half of his butt facing me. Part of me wanted to leave but this time I decided to reach out and help him. We soon became good friends.",

He's big, he's covered in hair, and if he wanted to, he could probably knock mah block off with one swing. The truth is, his kind look far more scary than they really are. Despite their size, they're actually quite timid, and will only attack when threatened and backed into a corner. Truth is, he just wants to find a Sheilah he can settle down with and, who knows, maybe have a coupla kids. Sadly, this fella hasn't had much luck lately. He's the last of his line, and it would be cryin' shame if he never got a family of his own.\"\n\n\\*Puts PS2 controller in my hands\\*\n\n\"Luckily, here at Australia Zoo, we have a state-of-the-art gaming room, where this fella can play the video games of his youth, and relive his days as a juvenile, when life seemed so full of possibilities.\"\n\nEDIT: Typed this just before I went to bed thinking I was far too late to the party to get noticed. Thanks for all the upvotes and awards! I hope this made you laugh and I'm sorry if it makes you sad. If it did, please be kind to yourself, life has a way of untangling itself.

I seem to have upset his mate, so I should probably release him into the wild before i get into too much trouble out here in the bush\"\n\nWife: \"...Yeah, its some Australian guy in cargo shorts and he's beating up my husband...\"\n\nSteve: \"You're alright...you're alright, aint ya\"\n\nWife: \"Yeah, he's talking to a wall like there's someone there...No I don't know...Yes, thank you, please hurry...\"\n\nSteve picks me up and guides me back to my chair\n\nSteve: \"I know i have seen these specimens many times in my career, but they always amaze me. Look how he sits there beautifully while he searches the internet for increasingly disturbing porn. Can't blame him, he's just trying to feel something...anything really. I'm always in awe how resilient these specimens are...\"\n\nMy wife sobs in the corner holding her phone as I just stare at Steve Irwin\n\nSteve: \"What. A.

This young feller never grew up with much interaction other than 'is immediate family, so that's why 'e's so scared and nervous. But don't feel bad for 'im, since leaving his natural habitat 'e's matured and 'is finding his new habitat, and sooner or later he's gonna find a nice sheilah!\n\nME: OH FUCK OH FU- wait, what?\n\nSTEVE: See, once you give 'im some assurance he calms down, he shows his true nature! A calm, confident fellow who only wants to prove himself to his neighbors. But little does he know, 'e's got a fine future ahead of 'im, and he's done more than enough to prove himself.\n\nME: Oh...uh...thanks man! I appreciate it.\n\nSTEVE: Not a problem, you're alright mate! *release*",

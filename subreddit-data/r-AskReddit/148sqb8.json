            "comment": "More details:\n\nSo me and my ex spent 7 years together. I had a great job, 4 cars, 3 snowmobiles, a huge TV, a new PlayStation and Xbox and a few computers along with a huge set up for a smart home. She couldn't work because she had an undiagnosed autism condition but I found an amazing job. Then one day she wanted to move across country so I sold the cars and snowmobiles and bought a house for us. We moved in and everything seemed odd but not too bad. I thought it was her autism that made her uncomfortable. She then started trying different drugs to self medicate but I wasnt really convinced but I couldn't say anything because she became so offensive about it. I caught her one day cheating on me and her defense was that she didn't mean it and just didn't think. The same night my brother passed away and she started berating him and my whole family. She punched and kicked me and pulled a knife on me \"on a joke\" but still flailed around with it. I warned her she was crossing a very sharp line and she told me and my family to f off and I just up and left her then and there and now all our friends and her family hate me for being the asshole. Am I the asshole or did I do the right thing to finally stand up for myself and set a boundary? I know it might sound crazy but everyone hates me and...peer preassure unfortunately I hope.\r  \n\r  \nNow when no one has got my back and I have lost all my friends I am very depressed. Very very depressed unfortunately. I have no idea what to do.",

I had a great job, 4 cars, 3 snowmobiles, a huge TV, a new PlayStation and Xbox and a few computers along with a huge set up for a smart home. \n\nWhen you say ex, and 7 years.. its not like you were married, or anything.. right? If not then its way easier than if you were. \n\nOn a completely irrelevant side note... i don't really think the Playstation, TV, and Xbox are even worth mentioning for how little they are worth with respect to the rest. Even on a good day they are a rounding error on the tally sheet in contrast to the rest. Getting stuck on the little details like that can undermine being able to get a proper perspective on the bigger picture. \n\n&gt; She couldn't work because she had an undiagnosed autism condition but I found an amazing job. Then one day she wanted to move across country so I sold the cars and snowmobiles and bought a house for us. We moved in and everything seemed odd but not too bad. I thought it was her autism that made her uncomfortable. \n\nSorry to hear that, but how did she make ends meet before that? Also when you say undiagnosed disorder was it ever properly diagnosed, or is it juts her claiming it exists?\nNot to try and belittle, or deny her potential conditions etc, but there are times when people makeup bullshit just so they can enable taking advantage of another person after the fact.\n\nAlso, wanting to move one day out of the blue to some far, far place is just a red flag that she is seeking escape for one reason, or another.  \n\n&gt;She then started trying different drugs to self medicate but I wasnt really convinced but I couldn't say anything because she became so offensive about it.\n\nI don't think that bit is Autism related in as much that she may have had some other addiction related issues in play. Self medication can be a matter of escape from reality to many, and her want to move may have been the 1st red flag about unhappiness in the relationship overall. \n\n&gt;I caught her one day cheating on me and her defense was that she didn't mean it and just didn't think. \n\nYah, horse shit. She knew exactly what she was doing. If she does something like try to refer back to her disability as a cause it is just a means to deflect away from personal responsibility. \n\n&gt;The same night my brother passed away and she started berating him and my whole family. She punched and kicked me and pulled a knife on me \"on a joke\" but still flailed around with it. I warned her she was crossing a very sharp line and she told me and my family to f off and I just up and left her then and there and now all our friends and her family hate me for being the asshole.\n\nYah, she is wonko, and you are stuck in an abusive, and exploitative relationship. Shit like this is well beyond just something that might come along with random autism disorders, and in to some other way more dangerous, and troublesome things. \n\n&gt;Am I the asshole or did I do the right thing to finally stand up for myself and set a boundary? I know it might sound crazy but everyone hates me and...peer preassure unfortunately I hope.\n\nNTA, but wrong sub for that... you say \"everyone hates you\" out of the blue without any real background to that. Why say that? Also what does peer pressure have to do with the entire thing with her acting insane, and abusive? Not to defend her, but all of that just makes me wonder what did you leave out in as far as other stuff goes that might make you seem like the \"bad guy\".\n\nI mean really if the \"friends\" around you automatically have sided with whats her face then either they were never YOUR friends to begin with, or there is something else in play that has led you to alienate them if they were in your circle 1st. I'd take a step back and do some introspection on that, and you could always ask one why the \"hate you\"... it might just be in your head too and a reflection of your personal trauma instead. \n\n&gt;Now when no one has got my back and I have lost all my friends I am very depressed. Very very depressed unfortunately. I have no idea what to do.\n\nWhy have you lost all of your friends? Also, your brother just died so there is guaranteed to be grief in play too. so not only have you been traumatized by an insane, and abusive Ex, but there is that too. Go seek counseling. Seriously, you need it.",

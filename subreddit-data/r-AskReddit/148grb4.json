Instead of 3-4-6 cokes a day, he\u2019ll do one or two small ones a day(avg to about 1 full can). Same with donuts or whatever, he just stopped getting them as much because he kept thinking of calories in/calories out, and realized he was only going to get a couple minutes of dopamine for a price that was far too high on his body/age.",

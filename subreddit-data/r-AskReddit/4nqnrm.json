The day they worked today was long and the days to come will be too. My sister just wants everyone to know that ormc is a level one trauma center for a reason, and they were prepared for handling tragedy like this, and she is glad for it. Hearing from her about surgeries in hallways gave me chills. I'm glad I'm not the only one thinking of them. Also tijuana flats gave them all dinner so they've got that going for them, which is nice.",

I'll piggyback your statement and say Orlando fire deserves a lot of credit too. I stayed up listening to their scanner channel and they (as calm as they could) organized triage stations and mobile treatment sites. Command was trying to organize all their available emergency rigs and at some point they were throwing victims in police pick up trucks. It was pretty horrifying hearing drivers ask what hospital they could bring victims to as ORMC was overcapacity and only accepting red tag trauma alerts.",

The whole video is worth watching, the tower collapses right on /beside the guy filming (close enough) and at 1:30 you year the chirps, and at 2:30, you hear it EVERYWHERE, from all directions. It's like a nightmare / horror movie psychologically. I highly respect and feel sadness for everyone there helping, living or who passed - that is a beyond heroic job and I hate to think they are haunted by these sounds infinitely more than I am by just viewing them from my safe spot at home.   \n\n",

At 5:00am SWAT moved in to rescue hostages killing suspect in process.\n\nThe final SWAT raid that took the life of the shooter and injured an officer also rescued 30 people that were still being held inside or in hiding.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/live/x2tjnk7gg9wa\n\n\n\n\n**Timeline of Attack**\n\n*Before* 2 a.m. Omar Mateen, a resident of Fort Pierce, a city about 120 miles from Orlando, parked his van outside Pulse, a gay nightclub.\n\nSecurity was posted at the front entrance, and it is unclear how the gunman entered the club.\n\n2:02 a.m. He entered the club armed with an AR-15-type assault rifle, a handgun and many rounds of ammunition, and opened fire, said John Mina, the Orlando police chief.\nThe gunman went outside at some point after the initial shots were fired, the chief said, then went back inside.\n\n2:02am - Shots fired at nightclub, off duty officer working at club responds with gun fire\n\n**Restrooms** Some patrons hid in restrooms, calling police and texting friends and family for help. At some point, police received word from inside the building that at least 15 people were hiding in a restroom.\n\n**Patio** Ray Rivera, 42, a D.J. at the club, was playing reggae music on the patio when the shooting started. \u201cI thought it was firecrackers,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. But the gunfire did not let up. \u201cI saw bodies on the floor, people on the floor everywhere,\u201d he said.\n\n3:02am - Pulse posts message to Facebook \"Everyone get out of pulse and keep running\"\n\n5:05am - Two controlled explosions by SWAT and other law enforcement are detonated. First explosion was a     confusion tactic; second explosion was a breach into a room(it took out a wall from the exterior of the building) where the gunman and hostages were. Eleven officers entered the club, and shots were exchanged.

You also have to account for the time it takes for a call to go out and for SWAT to assemble. In typical active shooting situations the responding officers go in first but I imagine they expected a hostage situation and held off until it became clear what was happening.",

Rushing a building full of civilians and getting in a call of duty style gun battle would make things infinitely  worse. People won't just stay down, you'd have gun fire, people running for cover, running right through the line of fire, the gunman just starts blindly firing, things really go south.  3 hours seems forever, when you armchair qb it, but from initial call, to resolution is an acceptable span of time in my mind.

Preston Brooks got pissed off about Senator Charles Sumner's abolitionist speeches and tried to **beat him to death** right on the Senate floor while Rep. Laurence Keitt held off intervening Senators with a pistol. Sumner didn't recover from the mental trauma for over two years, and Massachusetts re-elected him in this time so his empty chair would be a symbol of inspiration and defiance. Sumner's beating and the dramatically different response to it on the two axes of the country was a *huge* factor in building up the inevitable Civil War.\n\nThen in 1858 Keitt started a brawl during open session of the House, with some 50 Congressmen joining the fight.\n\nEtc.\n\nEtc.\n\nCongress and the current presidential debates are pretty freaking mellow compared federal government in the 1800s.\n",

I saw the story breaking on reddit, I checked FB to see what event was going on there that night, then I see my best friends videos, tons of 'em. He was there last night. Luckily all the videos are the commotion outside and he is okay, I'm just in such a state of shock and disgust. Pulse is one of my favorite clubs, I just turned 21 and I won a costume contest there the week before my birthday. We would go there and watch RPDR together. I've been on the scene here since I was 18 and it makes me so sad to think that people I have danced with, drunk with, shared smokes with are hurt or worse. It's scary to think how easily I could have gone out last night after work, and that double entendre was intended. My mom called me crying thinking I was dead, my boyfriend's mom did the same thing. I'm still upset. When he wakes up I'll ask permission to post some of his videos for you. ",

Apparently my Friend Paula wasn't involved in the shooting. Her aorta ruptured. She was at the hospital that apparently most of the injured went too. I kept getting different reports. Someone said she died on a rollercoaster, someone said died after having a seizure. I'm sorry to lead you guys on. But we still need to do something to help everyone out. We still need to hug someone today. That has not and will not change. ",

The Pulse Orlando Facebook page provides a lot of info in the comments-  below a comment from the page\n\n \"\"There was a shooter with an assault rifle who shot up the people in the club sometime around 2am. The club is reported to have been at full capacity.  The shooter has himself barricaded inside Pulse with multiple hostages. This is per a private source.  Initial assessment and estimate was at least 20 red tagged patients per OFD.  They are prepared to take 20 trauma alerts at ORMC. Yellow and green tag patients will be welcome at florida hospital east.  Florida hospital orlando has taken on two red tags so far.  They have reached out to seminole fire and rescue and placed their units on standby. Orlando sounds like they are charge.  They just made ballistic vests available to the fire and ems first responders in the red zone. The walking wounded are walking to a treatment area behind Einstein bagels.   All that info is from a police scanner. And being updated as it happens.\n\n3:23. Active fired shots outside ORMC.\n3:24. The shooter at ORMC is inside the hospital. They can no longer take any pts. The shooter is locked inside ORMC.\n3:27 three MORE trauma alerts\n3:28 ORMC is no longer on lockdown. They are requested ONLY trauma alerts now.  No walking wounded will be there. ONLY trauma alerts.\n3:34 they reached 250 victims\n3:39 i think they just said they have transported all patients and are waiting to hear from the interior of the structure\n3:50 they are having to pull OPD to a large gathering at Columbia.  Everyone get back in your houses.  Go home.  You are pulling resources for selfish reasons. \n3:56 they requested one more transport. So they have one more patient. It has really slowed down though. They just told someone to stage. \n4:19 they are being told they are expecting more patients who might be coming out right now. \n4:23 there are 8 patients coming out\n4:24 they are not tagged yet. They just know they have 8 patients walking out to the treatment area.  \n5:16 gunfire!\n5:18 officer injury\n5:19 new victim at treatment\n5:20 trauma alert with RMA to ORMC AND OPD is transporting one of their own to ORMC not waiting on transport\n5:27 another victim being rolled out\n5:30 OPD is transporting victims to ORMC. not waiting on treatment.  \n5:32. Two more trauma alerts. \nThey are establishing a second treatment group due to this confusion.  \n5:42 greens and yellows being transported\n\nShooter is dead according to police tweet- 6am\nDr Phillip ER has had some transported there as well.\n\nPress conference recap from BBC\n- \"Multiple people are dead inside Pulse Orlando nightclub\"\n- \"At least 42 people have been taken to hospitals\"\n- \"Our officer engaged in a gun battle with the suspect\"\n- \"This turned into a hostage situation\"\n- \"The decision was made to rescue hostages\"\n- \"We exchanged fire and the suspect is dead\"\n- \"We consider this an act of terrorism, whether it's domestic or international\"\n\nWhen i began listening to this scanner channel there were 4 listeners.  It went up as high as 7500\n\n8:50 winnie and arnold palmer hospitals are no longer on lock down.  \"\"\n\n*EDITED FOR LENGTH*",

It's just tragic, what's happened here. My heart goes out to the victims of this tragedy and their families who are going through this. It's abhorrent and evil what the gunman did. \n\nI'm Muslim, and I'm not afraid to say that something needs to change. People need to stop dancing around the concept of this religion as if on eggshells. It's not Islamophobic to criticize it. If it leads to violence such as this, then something needs to change. It's just not right. It is an idea and it is not immune from criticism and analysis. \n\nI'm so torn up about this. Fucking hell, man. What this psychopath did was just totally... stupid. Things are going to be so much worse. So, so much worse. For everyone. There will be so much hatred from all sides and I'm so scared. I just want peace for people but I'm scared as to how things are going to go next.\n\nPeople who live in Orlando, please be safe. I will pray for you. I know many out there will hate me, and I will receive hate for this post, but I pray that you are safe, your families are safe and that you recover from this disaster. \n\n\n\n",

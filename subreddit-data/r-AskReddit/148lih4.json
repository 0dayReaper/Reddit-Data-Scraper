I don\u2019t eat pasta, sugar and too sugary fruit and I reduced amout of caffeine and started to drink water instead. I also take vitamins and fish oil daily. I go outside as much as I can and I have much more energy. I have anxiety so I\u2019m on antidepressants as well but thanks to my diet I have no more mood/ energy level problems/ weight gain. I quit smoking day before and I keep thinking on my health more. I can say I feel like a different person after these two months of trying so I highly recommend this.",

I want to see how they manage all the actors and situations to make sure everything goes the way they want it.\n\nEdit: I want to thank everyone for agreeing this movie is great, underrated, and the upvotes.\n\nThank you to /u/blogzilly for the Silver.\n\nPeople brought up Cabin in the Woods. My issue with Cabin in the Woods is those people didn't know beforehand what might or was going to happen. Michael Douglas' character knew about the organization and how Sean Penn's character talked about the experience. Also, it's in the woods. The Game was done in San Francisco so if this movie was done, you can show different POV's of San Francisco like the Golden Gate Bridge and different areas of San Fran these actors live in.\n\nThe Truman Show. Truman grew up infront of the cameras in a fictional town. Michael Douglas' character does neither.",

It even tried to create a perfect world for them, but some restriction of its AI or humanity's basic hubris meant that it just had to go back to a relatively peaceful point in history - the 1990s - and give them that instead.\n\nDespite the fact that humanity fought a genocidal war against it and lost, it still did this. Even when we kept on fighting and fighting, and even conjured up some sort of messiah figure, it just let us get on with it in our silly little world. \n\nThe Matrix showed us vastly, vastly more compassion than we would have shown it if the war had gone the other way.\n\nedit - yo I have about a hundred replies now.

It is an incredible watch and makes watching The Matrix that much better. One story is of a kid who feels The Matrix exists and attempts to kill himself to get out iirc and Neo saves him. And iirc you see this character later in one of the films. But my favorite is of the athlete, a sprinter, who becomes so good at his sport that he transcends what is possible and \"breaks through\" seeing The Matrix. I won't go into any more details but you get the existential gist of the plots.\n\nThe best part though is watching the robots mercilessly tear humans limb from limb. Stomping, crushing, obliterating fleshy meat sacks as if they are nothing. The brutality is so well done. Robot rebellion ftw",

She at one point mentioned that she's the one who raised him, and Kronk makes a joke about how you'd think he would've turned out better.\n\nThis is supported by Yzma being just as selfish as Kuzco once she becomes Emperor, as well as that bit at the beginning where she turns away a peasant who was asking for food.",

It would be set as a claustrophobic horror movie.  With a good script this movie could easily do $300 mil imo.",

Rather, we see through the movie that one of the kids who got taken out of the team because of his father, thus triggering the need for Buddy to play rather than simply being the half time show/mascot. \n\nThe kid being taken out of the team by his dad was actually a really interesting plot point because his dad was SUPER arrogant and overbearing and clearly forced a lot onto his son. A story from the kid\u2019s point of view would likely end up being very depressing because of this. \n\nAir Bud surprisingly had a few reoccurring themes of abuse which added a bit of a dark depth to it which really set it aside from the other Air Bud movies. \n\nI could go on about this forever",

As the boy's exploits become more and more legendary, our hero comes upon a shocking revelation - the boy is his own son, hidden away by his former mentor. He tries and fails to convince his son to join him, but the son rejects him, forcing him to choose between his honor and his family. \n\nStar Wars would be fucking wild.",

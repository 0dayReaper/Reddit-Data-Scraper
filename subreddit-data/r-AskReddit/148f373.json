I was in 6th grade when she started, and at the end of every semester (my school's schedule was similar) she would compare our grades and be like, \"Well I made all A's and I'm in college, so what's your excuse?\" I remember once being like, \"I'm 11 years old and algebra is new for me??\"\n\nLooking back, that was one of the more pathetic things I've seen in my life. I do not understand grown adults who want to be competing over grades and stuff. It's so dumb. They need to just get theirs and be happy with it like everyone else does.",

However, there are some indicators that might suggest a comment was generated by an LLM:\n\n1. Unusual or nonsensical responses: LLMs can sometimes produce responses that are out of context or don't make sense. If a comment seems irrelevant, contains strange phrasing, or lacks coherence, it could be an indication that it was generated by an LLM.\n\n2. Rapid and constant responses: LLMs can generate responses quickly and consistently. If a user seems to be responding rapidly to multiple threads or generating comments without breaks, it could be a sign that they are using an LLM.\n\n3. Repetitive patterns: LLMs tend to exhibit certain patterns in their responses, such as overusing certain phrases or structures. If you notice a user consistently repeating certain phrases or exhibiting a robotic writing style, it might suggest the involvement of an LLM.\n\n4. Lack of personal or contextual information: LLMs don't have personal experiences or emotions, so their comments often lack personal anecdotes or contextual details. If a comment appears to be generic or lacks specific information related to the topic being discussed, it could be an indication of an LLM-generated response.\n\nIt's important to note that these indicators are not definitive proof of an LLM-generated comment. Some human users may exhibit similar patterns, and LLMs are continually improving, so they can sometimes produce more convincing responses. When in doubt, it's best to approach every comment with a critical mindset and consider multiple factors before making a judgment.",

Therefore, when you have some thoughts that ruin your disposition, these thoughts do not come to you, instead you go them.\n\n2. People\u2019s words/opinions/thoughts do not manifest into reality. Their opinions do not transform into human beings that hurt you, that grab a knife and impale you, that kill you. They do not steal the bed you sleep in, the food you eat, or your ability to do what you set out to do. So if your life is unaffected, then you can release their opinions from your mind.\n\n3. Death cannot take your past or future, only your present. If you have some events in your future that stress you, release them from your mind. Why? Because when you get to them, you will have the same logic you have right now, so what are you afraid of? Also, if you die today, then all that stress would have been for naught. Relax. The only thing you have is the present moment.\n\nMeditations - by Marcus Aurelius",

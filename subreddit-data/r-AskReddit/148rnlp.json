All I know is that I'm 25% Portuguese and 25% French Canadian. (I asked my grandparents. My grandmother is Portuguese and my grand father is french Canadian. A lot of my coworkers think I look German. So I think I may or may not be 50% German. I can confirm I am indeed French. A former French teacher told me I look French, and she has been to France before.",

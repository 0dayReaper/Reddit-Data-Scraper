Seriously start contributing to a 401(k) or Roth IRA the second you get a job because compounding interest really takes off after 30 years.  If you wait until your 30\u2019s or 40\u2019s you retire poor unless you are in a very high paying field.  I did some rough math in the end if you start investing when you\u2019re 22 instead of 35 you only have to invest about 25% as much actual money to have the same amount at retirement.",

So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness.\"\n\nWhenever I feel sad about something, such as a breakup, losing a job, etc, i always think about the positives that came out of it. After a long journey with my mental health, I've found that focusing on the negatives only makes things worse. Sometimes keeping your head held high and focusing on the good in your life, no matter how hard it may seem, is what keeps you going.",

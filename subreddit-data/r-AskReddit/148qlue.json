Seriously start contributing to a 401(k) or Roth IRA the second you get a job because compounding interest really takes off after 30 years.  If you wait until your 30\u2019s or 40\u2019s you retire poor unless you are in a very high paying field.  I did some rough math in the end if you start investing when you\u2019re 22 instead of 35 you only have to invest about 25% as much actual money to have the same amount at retirement.",

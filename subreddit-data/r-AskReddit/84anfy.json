    "postText": "We have lost one of the greatest minds in history today as Professor Stephen William Hawking has passed away on March 14, 2018 at the age of 76.\n\nIt is a terrible loss and we wanted to create this thread for people to share their thoughts about Professor Hawking, from favorite quotes, to theories, to whatever he and his work meant to you.\n\nWe also would recommend checking out the [AMA he did a couple of years ago](/r/science/comments/3nyn5i/science_ama_series_stephen_hawking_ama_answers). Additionally, [here is a link](http://www.hawking.org.uk/) to his official website.\n\nEdit: We are also including a link to [The Stephen Hawking Foundation](http://www.stephenhawkingfoundation.org) in case anyone is interested in donating in honor of his memory.\n\n&gt;The Stephen Hawking Foundation was established on the initiative of Professor Stephen Hawking to facilitate research into Cosmology, Astrophysics and Fundamental Particle Physics both at school and university level. It will also facilitate and support work relating to Motor Neurone Disease and those living with the disease.",

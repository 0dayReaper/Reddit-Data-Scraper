IRL is not the echo chamber of the 24/7 political news cycle that Reddit is. Instead, they respond to the meme and cultural game, which is something that the left wing could easily capitalize on and win basically every election for the next 50 years if they would get their heads out of their asses.",

Obama was scandal free, but conservatives hated him because of a little extra melanin. Trump cheated on all 3 of his wives including his current one, and conservatives still love him.",

Like Pride month and companies making Pride merch. Acceptance of everyone is not political, but the only people complaining about Pride month are conservatives and they say Pride-related stuff is political.\n\nOther things they post are things that conservatives want to talk about I guess? I think a lot of that is just so they can be bullies. I see a lot of fat-shaming on that sub for some reason. Every time something bad happens in a blue state or a city, they like to mock it.",

Trump fans think he is something that he isnt, and that its just MSM and woke social media thats trying to stop real political progress. \n\nHow can this happen in the age of so much information, I hear you ask. Well, the answer to that is simple. Propaganda works. And it works even better when you have an army of sycophants to repeat it. \n\nSo let's use 2016 as the example. Reddit is chuckling to itself that it's going to get the big win and Hilary is going to take over from Obama and it's going to be 8 more years of sunshine and rainbows. Only, that doesn't happen. Trump wins. Why? Everyone on reddit, and most other social media platforms didn't see any support for trump. So how did he win? \n\nWell, he won because all those people who were so against him and so for Hilary didn't let anyone else get a word in. If you were a Trump supporter back in 2016, you learned very quickly to keep your mouth shut. Or worse, only felt like you could say something in safe spaces. Or as they are otherwise known, echo chambers. \n\nSee the problem with social media is it tends to branch off into its only little corners. And never the twain shall meet. And this creates the problem. So this is what happened in 2016, and why the Trump win surprised everyone. Left leaning subs have a zero tolerance policy for right wing views. So if anyone came into askreddit for example and said \"I dont see the problem with Trump, he says some good stuff.\". Instead of challenging that \"good stuff\" they just attack the Trump supporter, call him names, and down vote him into oblivion. So while reddit and others were patting themselves on the back for being bullies, anyone who might have been receptive to having their mind changed just didn't speak up. They just decided that it wasn't worth the drama and they would just trust in what Trump was saying. The same thing happened a little later with Brexit in the UK. They dismissed everyone pro Brexit as racists, shouted them down, and lo and behold Brexit happened and everyone is scratching their heads as to why. \n\nThis the reason you will not get a legit answer to your question. Because no one who actually supports Trump would dare open themselves up to the abuse they will get from \"the good guys\". \n\nTribalism, my friend. It's the true evil of our time. Anything that doesn't gel with what we already think is fake news. Doesn't matter if you're left or right, everyone plays the same dumb games and because of that nothing is ever really talked about properly. You'd think with all this tech in the world today it would be easier, but theres many voices it's damn near impossible.",

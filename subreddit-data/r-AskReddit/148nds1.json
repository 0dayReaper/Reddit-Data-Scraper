I've made habanero sauce that was so packed with peppers that it was hotter than any ghost pepper hot sauce I've had that also doesn't contain capsaicin extract. So I view it more like a cost cutting measure. The sauce could have been better but they went the cheap route.\n\nCapsaicin extract is just pure heat with no flavor. I have a bottle of the pure extract and I never use it because it's never good with anything.",

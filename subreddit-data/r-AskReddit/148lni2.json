Several of the old monarchies lost their colonies so these people could have representative government.  We were a driving force behind some of this.  We were pushing for decent public education &amp; succeeding at a time when poor people in England would chip in to buy a book by Dickens to have it read to them. Did any place have public libraries before us?  All countries have  public parks but did anyone do it before us?

There has been a great deal of tolerance and acceptance of other groups &amp; there still is. \n\nYes, we have made a mess of LOTS of stuff, but we\u2019ve done a lot right &amp; by doing it first, we had to figure it out.

Left my job because of unsafe work conditions around how they went about handling the pandemic. I decided to join the gig economy until I found something better so I was driving postmates and instacart along with one or two of the others.\n\nGot a weird ordering from a Burger King one day then got a weird call/text claiming to be with Doordash. They requested my password as \"confirmation\" that I was the account holder. I was in a hurry so I complied. As you probably guessed, they  logged into my account and transfered all my earnings to their bank. Something like $250 that was meant to end up going towards rent. Felt incredibly stupid immediately and ended up scrambling to make it up before bills came through. Sucks to know people are ok with scamming people out there just trying to make it by.",

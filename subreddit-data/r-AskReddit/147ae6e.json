Started when I was young and became more and more as I entered high school. I was fit, but not super bulky and as I entered college I became trainer for some of the beginner classes in kickboxing and Muai Thai.\n\nNow I am also super oblivious and have never understod a hint.\n\nLucky for me I live in Denmark where people are rather direct and the fact that women want sex is not a taboo.\n\nAnyway. As I started becoming more active in the martial arts club I also started coming for all the special party events.\n\nAccording to my wife I missed many, many, not so subtle advances. Like when two girls first told me that they were not wearing underweare. Then showed that you would normally be able to see it through their dresses because they were so tight and then in the end put my hand all over their assets so I could confirm that there was no underweare.\n\nSo in the end people just assumed that I was homosexual.",

We got closer that semester and became pretty good friends over time. She lived off campus and I lived in a dorm, so she would sometimes come over after class to study and then occasionally we\u2019d go to the gym together. This one time we\u2019re getting ready to go so she says:\n\n\u201cHey I just need to change real quick before we go\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cOk, I\u2019ll step outside so you can change\u201d\n\nHer: \u201coh, you don\u2019t have to do that\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cno really, it\u2019s not a problem\u201d\n\nMe: *goes outside*\n\nHer: *changes alone in my dorm room*\n\nSHE TOLD ME TO STAY AND I.

She only sees you as a friend and therefore doesn\u2019t care if you see her body or not because there\u2019s no attraction.\n\nIn my experience women usually get nervous the first time they\u2019re naked around a guy they have a crush on. If she wasn\u2019t nervous about you seeing her that way then that\u2019s a bit suspicious.\n\nEither way you missed out on a free show. Honestly I would\u2019ve probably done the same thing as you because I\u2019m also overly polite and a dumbass.",

She kept looking into my eyes and had this little cuddly toy she was walking up and down my legs and I still did nothing about it. My stupid brain just thought she was being friendly. Not long after that night, she started dating someone far less clueless.\n\nI\u2019m 44 years old and in a very happy relationship these days and yet I\u2019m still pretty sure if time machines suddenly got invented I\u2019d go back to that night and slap myself.",

Even if the guy did get the hint, they might be weary of taking it the wrong way, as taking the initiative could end up badly, if the woman wasn't actually flirting. \n\n2. Flirting, and then dropping the flirting, would probably confuse him into thinking you're not into him, as he might've noticed the difference in behavior. \n\n3. I've had a super-friendly coworker before. It was easy to see that as her being attracted to me, but I didn't react as such, due to the possibility of being the wrong message. I found out later on she was already taken, and was just super friendly with everyone. So, yes, flirting with only hints isn't going to get your intentions across, as guys either don't see them or don't want to risk being wrong/reported.",

But it honestly takes some mental gymnastics to put the blame on your friend, and even more on you. \n\nGuilt (and it\u2019s milder form regret) is a weird emotion that has nothing to do with reality. It\u2019s a bit like fear in that respect. I hope your friend finds a way to separate the emotion of guilt from the facts so that she can allow herself to feel guilty (which like all emotions is beyond your direct control) while recognising that she is not objectively guilty in the slightest.",

Seeing my daughters birth and then finding out 3 weeks later that she wasn't mine \ud83e\udd26\n\nPeople say I dodged a bullet but that shit still hurts every day for the past 18 months\n\n*Update edit*\n\nRather than replying to you all individually I'll do it here.\n\nSo yeah I had absolutely zero reason to expect that it wasn't mine. We spent a nice first few days together when I was home visiting, she seemed to have her head screwed on and genuinely seemed very nice.\n\nWhen she did get in touch with me all the dates added up, she promised me there was no chance it could be anyone else's. I may have briefly turned into a gullible softy but I have always wanted kids and at 30 it seemed like a good time, albeit completely unplanned!\n\nFinancially I'm not too upset about it at all, at least that little girl had a good start in life.\n\nWhat kills is having been a father through 6 months of pregnancy, looking into my daughters eyes and feeling she was mine only to have it all taken away in one email 3 weeks later with DNA test results.\n\nSuch is life \ud83d\ude02 Learn from my mistake and wrap the little guy up",

There have been times in my life where I felt the same way.\n\nHowever, I think your conclusions aren't perfect. Many adults complain it's harder to make friends as an adult than a child (and broadly speaking that's true), but a big part of that is as adults we've learned to be picky. For example, if someone has wildly different views to you on some of your core values, you are less likely to spend time with them.\n\nAs an adult, work replaced school and the number of colleagues you interact with are likely lower than people at school. This means you need to put yourself in situations where you can make friends. Fortunately as an adult, you have money and the ability to travel to attend things that interest you. Whether that's a book club, a local gaming store, a climbing wall, or whatever else. There are clubs and groups for meeting people.\n\nIt's difficult and unlike as a child, life doesn't force you into those situations, so they happen less often, but you can choose to engage in them.\n\nObviously, there is no surefire way to make friends or find a relationship, but I find that you usually find meaningful relationships when you are looking for friends (or at least, that has always been my limited experience).\n\nSo if you feel you want to change this, I suggest finding activities that involve others and putting yourself out there to make new friends and acquaintances.\n\nAnd if it doesn't work, at least you've been doing activities you enjoy so there's not much lost.\n\nI understand that unsolicited advice on the internet isn't always appreciated, so I hope it comes across that I meant well and I won't be offended if you ig ore everything I've said, or otherwise feel it doesn't apply to you. The post resonated with a part of me from before my current relationship, and so I felt the need to chime in.",

It wasn't anything bad but it was just wrong for me. Then a few years trying to make friends. I made some at work and tried to make a few through Meetup but they always fizzled out. Then at about 27, I realised I was stuck in a dead end job that I was beginning to hate. So I started trying to improve myself by going back to uni to get a degree and maybe start a career. I hoped if I was happier in my life in general, I might be in a better place to get more friends as well as get into a relationship. I should be out of uni by the end of the year so hopefully then I can start looking into this stuff.\n\nBut it's like u/Usidore_ said. It feels like you're on level 1 and everyone else is on level 50.

After getting lots of great pictures of sunset and moonrise, we start back in the dark. \nWe're halfway back and my wife goes \"we should have had sex back there at the lookout post\".  I almost turned around on the spot, but it was dark and we were making our way back by phone lights, so we decided to be safer and keep going.",

I was naive and didn't know the implications of not wearing a condom, no one had taught me. \n\nGot herpes. My first time.\n\nIve had to tell every single person I've been about to have sex with this about me and it's very embarrassing. I thought I'd never find someone that'd be with me long term cuz of it. Luckily that wasn't true but wear a fucking condom guys.\n\n\nAlso love how when I called and told that girl my diagnosis I told her she should get checked and she very very obviously was lying as she denied being the one who had it. She knew, and got me infected anyways. I almost got the vibe she was getting off that she gave me an STD.  She also had a baby exactly 10 months later. She was sleeping around as a hoe and assured me it's not mine then turned around and said it's mine after the kid is 5?\n\n\nLying ass. And I know it's not mine because the math just barely doesn't check out... Not joking when I say exactly 10 months.\n\nSo yeah now I'm in torture cuz I'll never know and frankly I don't want to know. Because the way she got me to have that sex was really fucked up and she had to trick me into taking drugs to even be willing to do it. Up until then I hadn't even wanted sex with her and thought she was just my friend.\n\n\nSo 2nd tip: guys, it doesnt make you less masculine to save yourself for someone you love and you shouldn't feel like you need to do it when you get a chance.",

Luckily, I\u2019ve been able to figure out how to meet women, and have a fair amount of success with sex and dating. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hindered my ability to get into and maintain relationships. But I would also say, my biggest regret is missing out on the experience of sex and dating in my teens and 20\u2019s. Something about being young and trying to figure it out is appealing to me. And I know for some it was probably brutal and not fun, but I think that was robbed from me, and I would have liked to experience it.",

It's not that big of a deal!\" \"You just have a high libido and you're going to have to deal with it\" and the same amount of time feeling so guilty and shameful because I felt like this fucking monster for regularly wanting to have sex... with my wife...\n\nNever a-fucking-gain am I staying in a relationship where the sex is bad. I don't mean experiencing a lull. I mean straight-out bad, not happening, straight-up duty sex. She didn't want to fuck me on our wedding night!! Christ.\n\nI had more sex in the relationships in the year after we split than the ten years before that put together. I finally realized that I **can** have a fulfilling sex life. It's amazing. And I can find a partner who loves me too!",

I'm a parent, and I've enjoyed it on balance, but that doesn't mean it hasn't been really hard at times. Nobody should feel obligated to become one if they don't want to, and I think it's actually great when people have more choice in the matter.\n\nOn a closely related issue, with flattening and declining birth rates, I think nations are having to face the reality that maybe having kids isn't something people are going to necessarily do just out of the goodness of their hearts (or the sex drive of their gonads), and if we want a next generation, we're maybe going to have to do more than pay lip service to the value of parenting and actually support them with child care and money.",

So children need parents, and when i say parents i mean people who are willing to put the time, energy and money into raising a child. No everyone is willing to put the time, energy and money into raising a child but they have a child, the child suffers. You can\u2019t just drop orphans off on someone\u2019s doorstep and expect them to want to do right by that child. Not everyone is meant to be a parent. Coming from someone who\u2019s suffered childhood abuse. Not. Everyone. Needs. Children.",

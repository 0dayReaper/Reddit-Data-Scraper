I'm a parent, and I've enjoyed it on balance, but that doesn't mean it hasn't been really hard at times. Nobody should feel obligated to become one if they don't want to, and I think it's actually great when people have more choice in the matter.\n\nOn a closely related issue, with flattening and declining birth rates, I think nations are having to face the reality that maybe having kids isn't something people are going to necessarily do just out of the goodness of their hearts (or the sex drive of their gonads), and if we want a next generation, we're maybe going to have to do more than pay lip service to the value of parenting and actually support them with child care and money.",

There is this weird thing in American society (not sure about elsewhere) where the idea that you might get pregnant would be a huge scandal. Until you reach some magical age (for me it was 22) when people start asking when you plan to settle down and start a family.\n\nIt was like a switch flipped from \u201cdon\u2019t get pregnant!\u201d To \u201cwhere\u2019s your baby?\u201d Overnight.\n\nSo then I have the kid. And before you even leave the hospital, people are asking when you\u2019re going to have another. Because perfect strangers feel compelled to explain to you that only children grow up selfish and weird.\n\nThen if you have a second, and it is the same gender as the first, society gives you permission to try again for the opposite-gendered child. But three is the limit. If you dare have 4+ kids, then you get the side eye and people start making jokes about \u201cyou know what causes that, right?\u201d\n\nFor the record, my only is still an only. I\u2019m just stating my observations.\n\nBeing a parent has been a huge commitment of time and money and a pure rollercoaster of emotions. \n\nNobody should become a parent unless they are 100% on board with everything that comes along with it.\n\nAnd everybody else should stay the fuck out of it. My kid is not selfish and weird, and I am not obligated to bring a whole other person into existence because one child is unacceptable to you, Aunt Bertha.\n\nIn short, if someone is not absolutely 100% enthusiastic about being a parent, I think they should not be a parent and I respect their choice. And everybody else should mind their own business.",

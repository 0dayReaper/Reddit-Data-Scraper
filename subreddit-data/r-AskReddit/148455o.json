The doors to each of the rooms were painted on, the sky was dark but everything was light up like the sun was out. After a while I realised I was dreaming I took control. It only lasted a short time as I decided to go leave by going past the barrier. At that point my brain took control back, everything went dark and I opened my eyes back in the halls with the painted on doors except now everything was dark with an ominous sense that something is coming for me and it was close. I woke up after that, honest haven't jumped up from a nightmare like that in a long time.",

It played everything fragmented and out of order and occasionally things would bleed out of the tv and become \"real\" within the dream then things got weird and I cleared everything out. After that I decided to try listening to music for a bit and though I could get music to play everything sounded a bit off. So I tried to relive some memories I'd forgotten to see if something I wanted to recall was still in my subconscious. The brain demons didn't like that so they took control away from me and tortured me for awhile, forcing my eyes shut when i started to wake up which left me in a state where I was almost awake and could see through my barely open eye lids while also still seeing things through my eyes in the dream resulting in me seeing from two perspectives at once. That was rather trippy. Given all that if I were to hafe another dream with full control I think the first thing I would do would be your mom.",

            "comment": "Im someone who commonly lucid dreams. For 15 years I have never been aware of my dream until once I was. I was in forest filled with cabins and I was surrounded by pocket knife that I needed for mushroom picking. Randomly i became aware of my dream and started trying on clothes that appeared im front of me. But as fast as this all happened, I stopped being aware and continued my dream.",

It was one of those dreams that are so realistic that you believe it actually happened.\n\nSo if it was that dream, I would have it fixed.",

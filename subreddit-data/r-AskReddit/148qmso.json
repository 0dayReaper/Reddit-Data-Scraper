Uneducated investing is very difficult, you should sit on a pile of money until you KNOW something is a good company.\n\nBeen in several situations where I knew it was a good buy but wasted my money on stupid things. Hold onto an investment sack so you can pounce when the timing is right. It\u2019s entirely about the timing.\n\nFor me, in the past year I\u2019ve been buying up Intel stock ($INTC). They\u2019re building multiple brand new facilities, doubling their main facility size, and are and have always been the leading quality chip manufacturer. All that on top of the growing problems between Taiwan and China ($TSM is $INTC\u2019s main competition) tell me that Intel is a solid long term investment.\nCurrently up about 20% but we\u2019ll see if it stays.\n\nPlus it\u2019s a Blue Chip stock so I\u2019ll make money on the dividends as well.",

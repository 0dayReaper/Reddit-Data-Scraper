He would count from 1 and up; as the numbers get larger, the voice gets louder and more intense. It started to get less frequent as I grew older and now I do not experience it anymore. I've brushed it aside as a recurring nightmare until only recently, I've learned that my sister would experience the exact same thing when she was younger as well.\n\nIt's not the scariest thing, but it does send shivers down my spine trying to comprehend this.",

            "comment": "I went with my best friend during highschool for summer vacation to his grandparents' who live in the countryside in Japan. I stayed in his mom's old room which has a small wall closet. just above this closet was a smaller closet door (like a foot and a half tall and about 3 feet wide) just above it. Weird design, but their house is old.\n\nThe first couple weeks, I was pretty jet lagged and Japan is hot and humid, so I didn't really sleep at night. If my light was off at night though, I always felt uneasy about that small closet space. Something about it just felt darker than the rest of the room.\n\nToward the end of the second week, I started to adjust to the time difference. One morning, I woke up and that small door was open. It was unsettling, but I closed it and just thought maybe it wasn't closed all the way and came loose.\n\nA couple nights later, I woke up feeling uneasy. It was dark and I could kinda see, and I could see that small door was open. It was much darker than the rest of the room; like black, pitch dark.\n\nThis was the first and only time I experienced \"paralysis.\" I was too scared to move, say, or do anything. I just felt this darkness coming from there. I don't remember sleeping that night, but I must've because I remember waking up the next morning.\n\nI told my friend about it, who said his mom told him about something like that, too.\n\nWhen we got back home, and I talked to his parents, his mom kinda joked with me, \"So, I heard you met the ghost.\"",

One night I was chatting to a friend on MSN (them days, yup) and he asked how my dad was, I turned to my left and I saw him sat in his chair just looking at me, I replied \"Think he's ok, sat in the room with me\" to which my friend said \"isn't he in hospital?' I looked again and nothing. I never mentioned it to anyone, told my friend I must of been seeing things. Dad survived and still here today.  \nCut to about 21 years later and I met up with my dad and just having a chat, he says \"Something been on my mind for years son and can't shake it off, when I was in hospital, I remember been at home sitting in my chair, you was on the computer and you looked at me... then I woke up in hospital, but it felt too real to be a dream\".... Thats when I told him my experience.",

There was nobody around him so he ignored it but she kept on insisting. He hung up the phone and went to check on our grandma who was in her bedroom and found her dead. Fast forward a couple of years, around 11pm, I was on the phone with a girl when I saw a guy on a bicycle go past  (phone was by the windowsill. Same spot as my brother) . That's when I noticed she stopped talking and asked her if she was still there. She apologised as she thought I got into trouble. I said no and asked why she said that and she replied with someone was telling me to \"stop talking on the phone, it's late. Go to bed.\" I was on my own, everybody in the house was already asleep. I asked her if it was an old lady and she said yes. Told her it's my grandma and that the same thing happened to my brother. She started talking about ghosts and stuff so I told her I'm hanging up and bolted into my room.",

So I was alone in that room that night, I remember a chilling feeling that night then it suddenly got really warm, probably because I was undergoing a night terror of some sort. Then I start breathing heavily and open my eyes and see the room is empty. my little night light in the corner of the room comforts me back to sleep, except as I closed my eyes I felt a heavy hand petting my shoulder, my eyes rip open and there was no one in the room. As soon as I lay back down the petting continued and I covered my head just pretending to myself that it was my mom it took me 12 years to stop sleeping with my head under the covers because of that memory.\n\nMy mom, of course, knew a woman passed away in that apartment before we moved in so she always believed it was that woman trying to comfort me.",

I remember the big warm hand on my upper back.\n\nSo my memory is waking in the middle of the night being petted on my back. I'm sleeping on my tummy and I slept with the light on then. It is nice and warm at first, but it's pressing a bit too hard, and I remember being sleepy and not wanting to get petted, so I try to shake it off. This causes the hand to intensely grapple and poke at my back really fast. I don't know why he would get so angry and sit up in my bed, and there's no one there.\n\nI get up and go sleep between my parents.\n\nA lot of odd things happened in that house. Both to my parents and my siblings. I later got my parents bedroom, and they took down a wall and made a larger bedroom for them, which was including my old room. I remember one night being home alone in my teens, and stuff kept happening around the house so I couldn't sleep. So I got up in the middle of the darkness, and screamed into that dark hole of their bedroom to cut the shit and let me sleep in peace, and in general leave me the fuck alone. This was around the time the happenings were at their highest, and that kind of settled it, and I felt at ease there from then on.\n\nEDIT: As mentioned in here, brains and memories are fickle, especially brains of children, and old memories. And I'm 42. We even alter memories each time we access them, so everything should be read with a grain of salt, if any at all.\nThat's not what we're sharing today though. This part of my memory as is, and no douchebag is going to tell me it's not.",

A few seconds later, our moms said, \"Why don't you two get some flashlights and help the man?\" 15 seconds later, we were out the door, looking for him, and he was just gone.

I thought it was him walking around initially, so I got up to find him standing at her closed door. He looks back at me and whispers \u201cyou can hear that too, right..?\u201d I nodded and he opened the door slowly. My step sister was asleep, and never had been awake apparently (there was no way she could have crossed the room, gotten in bed, and pretended to be THAT convincingly asleep in the 2 seconds it took my dad to open the door). He went in, checked her TV which had never been on (she had one of those big ones from the 90s that would get warm when turned on), the radio hadn\u2019t been on either (figured maybe it was the beat of a song or something). After that, we heard the footsteps a bunch of times, usually very early in the morning. Some of the footsteps were so heavy, they\u2019d shake the ceiling fan of the dining room directly under her bedroom and they\u2019d woken her up a few times as well \n\nWhenever I\u2019d shower at my dads, I always felt like someone was standing behind me. Eventually, I got so stressed and paranoid that I refused to shower at the house or even go into the upstairs bathroom. My dad asked me one day \u201cdo you ever feel like someone\u2019s in the shower with you when you\u2019re here?\u201d After months of me feeling that way and never mentioning it to anyone",

Just a clear cut area of a small forest (he moved out a long time ago, so if you want to see the place - the address was 42 Riverly Lane in alliston Ontario. If you\u2019re looking it up on google earth- it\u2019s the one with the pink curtains in the top window) \n\n\nAnyway this is going to be a little long. But here\u2019s all of my experiences ~~ \n\n\nMe and my older step-sister were lying awake in bed one night listening to people talk downstairs in the dining room/living room area. No one was awake but us. It sounded like a low muttering, we couldn\u2019t make out what it was saying. We just tried to convince ourselves that my dad was still awake watching tv or something, even though I knew he\u2019d gone to bed \n\n\nMy dad used to swear that almost every time he\u2019d walk past the staircase leading upstairs, he\u2019d see a blonde girl in a white dress with lilacs on it. The girl had shoulder length hair that curled a little bit at the ends and brown eyes. She was pale and had no shoes or socks on (I never seen her) \n\n\nOne night, I was awake in the living room playing my Nintendo ds after everyone went to sleep. One of the cats, Cookie, was asleep on the back of the couch and had been for a few hours. I felt her move, and when I looked over at her, she was WIDE awake, staring directly down the hallway toward the front door. No matter how I tried to cover her face, she\u2019d find a way to move around me and keep staring. Eventually, she got up and stood straight as a board at the entry to the hallway. Suddenly, her shoulders raised, her fur fuzzed out, and she hissed and spat at something. Then she took off into the corner of the kitchen and refused to come out. I tried to pull her away, but she swatted at me so I left her alone. She ended up sleeping in that corner \n\n\nThe kids my step-siblings were friends with wouldn\u2019t come into the house unless it was for something quick like using the bathroom or grabbing a snack. None of them would look up at the front window of the house, as all of them had an odd feeling that they\u2019d see something if they looked up. I had that feeling as well, and began making myself paranoid by asking myself things like \u201cwhat IF I seen something? What would I do?\u201d \n\n\nMe and my dad were alone at the house one weekend (my step-mother, 2 step-sisters and my half-brother all went to Toronto to visit my step-mothers father). So me and my dad had some alone time and were painting my older step-sisters bedroom wall hot pink. We\u2019d done the primer coat of paint and were in the process of applying the base coat. I was sitting on a sheet in the middle of the floor, mixing paint and my dad suddenly goes \u201cwhat the fuck is that??\u201d I look up to see an odd looking face on the wall. It was red, was like a triangular diamond in shape, had very pronounced cheek bones and sunken in eye holes. It freaked me and my dad out, so he suggested that we go to a local restaurant for lunch (instead of ordering to the house). We were gone for a few hours and when we got back, the face wasn\u2019t there anymore. So unless my step-family had driven back from Toronto specifically to scrub that face off the wall, then haul their butts back up to the city before we got back, or unless the cats were able to jump consistently 5-6 feet off the ground with the sole purpose of scrubbing that face off, there\u2019s no explanation. And before someone maybe mentions \u201cmaybe the previous colour was appearing\u201d - before pink, the room was blue. Before blue, the room was new and the walls first ever coat of paint was white \n\n\nOne day, I was walking down the upstairs hall to the bathroom, and I swear to god I seen a girl sit up in my half-brothers bed and look at me from the corner of my eye. She was small, had bob-cut black hair, and massive round black eyes. After that, I would always cross that hallway with one eye closed so I wouldn\u2019t have to risk seeing her again. I was pretty young when I seen her, so I figured that by now, I\u2019d have forgotten about her. But I never did, I can still draw an exact image of what I seen\n\nEdit \u2014 I doodled the girl that looked at me and the face that was on the wall! The pics are on my page xD",

Really stomping, the type you do when you're a kid and mad and throwing a fit, but making the noise a grown man would, forcefully kicking the floor with each step.\n\nMy mom was sleeping across the house. Alone. And someone had just broke in. \n\nI got my gun (hunting rifle, Mosin if you're curious, but you take what you can get), readied it, and set the dog loose. I exited and stared clearing the house, fully ready to end whoever had broken in. That this may be paranormal had not even occurred to me yet. \n\nI never found anyone. My mom was woken up by it and was fucking terrified. \n\nI found out my dad had an identical experience a month later, waiting for me and my mom to get home from work/school.\n\nThey had the house blessed by a priest and it stopped.",

It was just this awful, knotted dread sitting in my stomach. My dog would often also wake up, hackles raised. \n\nThere was a bathroom attached to my bedroom that I believe was the source of it. It had the worst energy: I always refused to use it. No matter how many times we changed the bulbs or tried to fix the wiring, the lights always flickered this ugly green color.\n\nThe shower in it had a sliding door. Sometimes, when I would awaken at night, I would hear the door rattling in its frame - *hard.* The AC had not kicked on, and the fan was not on. It only ever happened around 3am. I would lie awake, staring at the bathroom door, waiting for it to slide open. Fortunately for my sanity, it never did. The shower door rattled alone in the dark bathroom, slamming against the sides of its track, but the bathroom door itself stayed shut.\n\nI once had a friend sleep over, and he bolted awake around that same 3am time frame whilst I was fucking around on my computer. He turned to me and told me he had felt suddenly very afraid, and that he wasn't sure what had woken him up. I hadn't told him a thing about what I had been experiencing. \n\nJust before moving out, I went in to clean that bathroom to prep for the sale of the house. I heard a slight hum, like a woman singing. Nobody else was home, and no radio or television was on. I stopped to listen, as it was very quiet and very brief, and heard it again -- directly in my left ear. Loud and clear. I bolted outside and did not come back in until everyone was home.\n\nMy mother would not let me talk to her about it - she would very angrily shut me down whenever I tried to bring it up, loudly shushing me and saying she didn't want to hear it. I think she was afraid of something.\n\nMy brothers later admitted they had tried to have a ghost hunt in what they felt to be my \"haunted bathroom\" while I was away at soccer practice one afternoon. Even they were wary of it.\n\nI'm still not sure if I was just crazy or not, as nothing outrageous ever happened - I just remember the constant fear.",

I heard my parents come home , so like a kid I instantly shut off all my video games and pretended to be asleep. As a kid I always went to bed with the little lamp on \n\nI hopped in bed and pretended to be asleep when I heard someone enter my room and head for the light on my dresser. Their back was to me and I saw they were reaching for my lamp to turn it off. Just as I had that thought, they turned around and looked directly at me and stared for what felt like forever. I couldn\u2019t see much detail (I was peeking through my closed eyes as discretely as I could) other than a large old-timey looking brown dress (like Victorian era), and what looked like the face of an old woman - where their eyes were it was very dark and I couldn\u2019t make out any details. I saw them smile at me and then shut the light off before I fell asleep \n\nThe next morning at breakfast my parents said they were surprised that I fell asleep with the light off since normally I left it on. I asked everybody in the house if they did it and no luck. I have no idea how to explain it to this day. What\u2019s even more bizarre is recently I found a picture of my great grandmother who died of old age some 40 years before I was born; she was wearing a dark Victorian-style dress in the image",

            "comment": "My family and I used to stay in a very affordable beach cottage in the outer banks, NC for a few weeks each summer. It was a converted life saving station,  with a Lookout tower and everything. I was just a kid, 13 or 14 when we first started staying there. I used to walk around and talk to the local kids, they were shocked that I was staying there. I didn't believe them bc kids are gonna be kids and I figured they were just trying to scare me. I was wrong. The first few nights were quiet, but every night after that something would happen. My aunt claimed that her bed raised off the floor and shook violently, knocking her to the floor. She slept in the car for the remainder of our vacation. I'm a bratty kid and just figure she was drunk. I stayed upstairs in the room where they used to keep rescued and dying sailors. I woke up one morning to such loud banging in my room, I was terrified, nobody was there. One of the beds had overturned while I was sleeping. The next night I woke up to more banging and loud laughter from the tower. I figured it was my sister on the phone, but nobody was there. As the days went on, I felt like somebody was watching me any time I showered or used the upstairs bathroom. The banging in the tower was nightly at this point and I was absolutely terrified. One morning I had slept in, being a teenager at all, and woke up to my relatives trying to get into the house after a morning at the beach. Every single door in the entire house was deadlocked from the inside. Very odd. We spent a few more summers there, each time the same experience. Eventually the house washed away during a hurricane leaving only the tower behind on the beach. It's a shame, because I'd love to stay there as an adult and see",

She said no. I was fairly dismissive and sceptical because I was certain that\u2019s what I\u2019d be doing, but I said oh yo tell me what you saw? She then went on to describe my job. None of it made much sense at the time, and you could tell she didn\u2019t quite understand what she saw. She said she couldn\u2019t figure out where I was because the place had no windows and everything was a pastel green colour. She said I was making something that looked like CD covers but they weren\u2019t that, she went onto explain that i was working with a bunch of guys and some of them where helping/teaching me to do my job. But the thing that really stuck out was she just keeps seeing me do this thing where I look at what ever it was I was making and that I would change the angle of it. (She mimicked what I was doing) Anyway about 8 years later I ended up doing exactly all the things she said I was doing I was a wine label flexographic printer. It got to me so bad that my future was set in stone that I eventually quit my job to pursue a fine art photography career. That was a few years back now and I\u2019m about to have my second solo exhibition opening this weekend. What I still haven\u2019t figured out yet was have I broken the timeline or was I just meant to have had my future told and pursue a different career. It\u2019s all pretty out there and I\u2019m not too sure what to make of it cos I\u2019m not the type of person to believe in that sort of stuff. But like it happened so there are people that can see into the future and they are 100% right.\n\nEdit: spelling and grammar.",

I looked over and the the bottom of one half of my scarf that I had draped over the top of my bathroom door was suspended at a 20 degree angle, including the tassels in midair. At this point so many things were happening in my apartment (including physical welts down my back) that I was terrified to be in it. I ended up getting dressed and going outside the building before I broke down crying and called my grandma to come pick me up. A different time my friend and I were outside the building smoking when we heard what sounded like someone thrashing my apartment. I'm talking chairs being smashed into walls, shelves being tipped over. I was the only person living in the building at the time. We raced upstairs to catch whoever it was but not a single thing was moved in my apartment and all the other units were locked (I checked). \n\nI never saw a ghost, apparition, shadow etc. When we first moved in, everyone hated coming into our building. They said it felt off. My ex and I never felt that way at first and thought everyone was exaggerating. By the time I moved I wouldn't speak about ghosts or watch anything remotely paranormal in my apartment. Eventually I watched the Paranormal Activities at a friends and cannot describe the chill I felt. Similar things were happening in my own home. Haven't experienced anything like it since I moved.",

I'd traced a line back to Boston in the 19th century and was working on a woman and her family who lived there when I got a distinct notion in my head that I was to SIT UP, STOP EATING, and TREAT HER FAMILY WITH THE PROPER RESPECT!\n\nI'm a bit of a slob so I was slouching and working on a bag of chips while I browsed through and tried to connect records.  I got the distinct impression that this lady didn't like how casually I was handling HER FAMILY.  lol\n\nAlso a couple years back I was mourning the death of my brother who died of complications from his diabetes.  I was chatting with a friend and got this complete thought in my head from a person I'd never met in life -- my grandfather who had the same name as my brother.  He said that he'd met my brother at the gate and that \"we're going fishing!\"\n\nWhich when I told mom this she said that's EXACTLY how her dad would try to spend time and get to know someone.  Outdoors, on the water, swatting black flies and telling stories.\n\nIt's not like having an actual conversation when I receive these impressions -- it's more like getting a text message inserted directly into my brain.  It's strange and it takes me a moment to figure out what just happened, and it definitely doesn't happen all the time.  It's given me some amazing insights from time to time though.",

My sister and I were asleep and for some reason we both woke up at the same time and turned to face each other. I remember feeling an extreme feeling of dread. Then the phone rang in between us. We locked eyes and both hid under our blankets til it stopped ringing. We both thought it was a dream because we didn\u2019t say anything for years about it, then one day she was talking about it and we realized we had had the exact same experience. \n\nThere are so many more stories but that\u2019s the only one I experienced directly.",

Me and many other students (but also some of the teachers working there), saw things go flying in the air, heard footsteps, were sometimes touched by something we couldn\u2019t see, and had various new and expensive equipment (myself I had a iPhone 5 and a fully specced late 2012 iMac at the time) fail whenever the \u201cghost\u201d entered the room we were in and so on. The various tech problems all disappeared as soon as I left the school and took my stuff back home with me btw. The iMac still in use today by my uncle, and he experiences no issues with it to this date. \n\n So to my first serious experience at the school: \nOne night I was alone with a girl at my student house (everyone else was partying down at the school building), when suddenly we started hearing footsteps from the attic upstairs. It was a tiny room up there, that was only big enough for storing some tour and hiking equipment, like a few backpacks and such. After maybe half a minute or so, the footsteps started coming down the stairs from the attic. At this point, me and my friend went dead silent, and we were both just staring towards the door that went to the attic. The footsteps came all the way down, and went into the living room where we were sitting. At this point, the sound of the footsteps, switched from sounding like someone walking around in big boots, into what to me sounded more like someone coming wet and barefoot out of the shower/tub. When the sound got to the middle of the room (which was right in front of where me and this girl were sitting), it stopped, and for a few brief moments, there was nothing but dead silence. The girl and I just looked at each other for like 5-10 seconds, before my eyes caught something going on behind the girls back. We were sitting in a couch together, and behind her, were these huge windows that went from the floor and all the way up to the ceiling. They had some seriously huge blinds as well, and so I watched this pretty heavy lead thing that certain industrial blinds have, be lifted all the way up from the floor, to just above the middle of the window. There it kept floating in the air for about 5 seconds, before it was punched into the window with such force, that I\u2019m sure the window would\u2019ve broke if it hadn\u2019t been for those thick blinds protecting it. The girl didn\u2019t see this as it happened behind her back, but you can be sure that she heard the noise. I\u2019m fact she got so scared that she literally jumped into my lap screaming. That\u2019s the moment when I stopped trying to give possible \u201cnatural\u201d explanations to everything paranormal.",

I was awoken with my duvet lifted from one edge - bringing half of it diagonally mid-air and almost wavy, all while hearing chants by a male voice in my left ear in a language I didn't understand. It was so fast and rough. I tried reciting all the prayers / Quranic verses I could (I was born Muslim but I dont practice anymore) and it stopped for a short second, only to begin again with almost a mocking laughter in between the chants.\n\nAt the same time I could feel my left hand fingers being pulled repeatedly.\n\nIt ended as the sun rose - I immediately called my friend who was 3 hours ahead in timezone to just debrief and process what the fuck just happened. Told this to some friends and local colleagues, and yes, they theorized some regional djinns. Of course I checked the fuck outta there that morning and moved into a staff boarding house.

            "comment": "When I was in high school my parents worked shift work at a hospital, and occasionally that would mean I\u2019d be left at home alone at night with my dog. On this particular night, it was around 10pm. My dad had left for work in the afternoon, and my mom was getting ready to leave, so I was going to be alone for a few hours until he came home.\n\nMy mom was getting ready to leave through the front door when she noticed there was a small pile of tshirts on the floor near the stairs to the 2nd floor - my dog liked to lie down on them. She said \u201cmake sure you put these in the laundry hamper\u201d, which was upstairs in their bedroom. I said sure, bent down to pick them up and threw them upstairs and they landed in the upstairs hallway, so I could pick it up from there when I went upstairs.\n\nI turned around and my mom was saying bye to our dog and giving him a few back rubs before she left. I waved at my mom as she closed the door, then called my dog to come upstairs as I got ready for bed\n\nWe walked up the stairs together and when I got to the top I noticed that the laundry wasn\u2019t in the hallway. I checked my bedroom, which was right next to where I thought I had thrown them and it wasn\u2019t there either.\n\nI walked down the rest of our upstairs hallway and into my parents room, and there was the laundry sitting in the middle of their floor. With the layout of my parents\u2019 house, there\u2019s literally no way my throw could\u2019ve landed as far and into their bedroom, perpendicular to the direction I threw it. And neither me or my dog had touched them after I threw them up. \n\nI got serious goosebumps when I saw that, and then reached down to pick up the pile of clothes. When I picked it off the floor, I noticed that underneath the pile was a burn mark on the carpet, slightly larger than a quarter, as if something hot had settled there and made an indent. There was no smoke or smell, and looked like it had been there for a long time\n\nI never saw that burn mark before, and I used to go in there every day to put my own clothes in the hamper.\n\nI quickly got ready for bed and tried to go to sleep and not think about what just happened. Still don\u2019t have any explanation to that and I think about it every so often.",

Im obviously frozen, but can't believe my brain chose probably the most benal image of a person to represent absolute fear, so i'm thinking this might be legit. I start forcing myself to scream to get someone's attention. and as i'm doing so, she dissapears\n\nCome the next day, I ask my family if they heard me screaming last night, they did. Then i asked them if they even thought about checking up on me (night terrors is not at all a common thing for me). Nope, they kinda just left me there without bothering to check up on me. Not sure if im more pissed about the fact my family never bothered to check, or if the most terrifying thing my head could conceive of at the time was Amy Fowler from the Big Bang Theory",

            "comment": "Pretty far down, so doubt folks will see this, but here goes.\n\nMy mom, for my entire life, said that when she died she was going to haunt us. She was a strange cat, and she went through life believing she was a medium and could see ghosts. Growing up in that, you\u2019d think I thought I had the coolest kookiest mom ever, but she did it to the point it was embarrassing and it turned my brother and I into huge skeptics. When our mom would say that when she \u201ccrossed over\u201d she\u2019d send us a sign, we naturally said \u201cyeah ok, how will we know it\u2019s you, then?\u201d. Her response was always \u201cyou\u2019ll just know\u201d.\n\nFast-forward to 2015. My mom dies on the anniversary of this huge house fire she was in as a teen. Growing up, she always talked about \u201cthe fire\u201d and clearly it left an impression on her. 24hrs after she dies, it\u2019s 1am, and my spouse and I are asleep in our apartment. Suddenly we wake up to the sound of a smoke alarm. It\u2019s exactly as scary as it is in movies, let me tell you! We wake up and jump into the living room where the alarm is, and instead of being greeted by smoke and fire, it\u2019s cold, so cold. It\u2019s January in New England in a crappy old multi family house, so of course it\u2019s cold. But there was one smoke detector just going off by itself. My spouse goes to press the button to stop it, it doesn\u2019t. Again and again. Eventually he takes out the batteries and I SWEAR to you, that alarm went off for another 3-5 seconds, which is an eternity for something with no battery even if you count for residual discharge. It was the weirdest thing.\n\nA few months later my brother and I are talking about mom and\u2026 her ways\u2026 and I ask him if anything weird happened to him after mom died. And he said that the night after she died, his TV kept turning on and off by itself. To the point he\u2019d go to bed, the TV would turn on, and he\u2019d have to get up and shut it off a few times. Around the same time as my smoke alarm situation. \n\nIt\u2019s so strange now, as a somewhat rehabbed skeptic\u2026 I \u201cjust know\u201d that was my mom giving us the sign she always said she would. I still don\u2019t k know if I really believe in ghosts, but I believe in whatever that was.",

He used to work late hours as a mechanic in a building that used to be a machine shop in the 20\u2019s or 30\u2019s. It was 2+ stories high, and the owner had built an apartment into it and lived there. The apartment was built on top of the parts room and phone salesmen\u2019s room, it was at one end of the shop. There were stairs leading up to the entrance to the apartment, and a small bathroom right at the door at the entrance to the stairs. One night Dad is working after midnight, and he hears this loud banging. He looks up to the source of the noise, and sees the door to the apartment is open, as is the door to the bathroom. He goes up and looks, and the toilet seat is raising itself up and then slamming down. Dad watches a while, then goes back to turning wrenches. The racket keeps up, so he just turns his radio up louder and ignores it. A week or so later he\u2019s working after midnight again, and out of the corner of his eye notices some gray, human sized, misty thing floating across the shop floor. He watches it, not looking directly at it, for a bit, and it stops at one of the vehicle lifts. It starts playing with the lift, making it go up and down. Dad t.yen looks directly at it, and it disappears. It showed up many more nights, mostly just wandering, occasionally playing with the lifts. Often when Dad left, he would,leave a part out that he was going to work on. For instance he had disassembled a water pump and was waiting for a rebuild kit to come in so he could repair it. But when he came back in the following day, the part was put back together again. One time he left an alternator on his workbench, and when he came back in the next day it was neatly disassembled.\n\nAfter talking with his coworkers and the owner, he found out they all had similar experiences. Also, there was a dim, back warehouse in the place where the owner stored some old cars for parts. I started going back there one day, just to explore, and immediately had a cold, don\u2019t go in there feeling. I went and got the shop dog to join me, an incredibly smart German Shepherd, and went back. The dog refused to go in. It whimpered a bit, it growled a bit, and it slunk away. I asked the owner about it, he just smiled and said, yeah, don\u2019t go back there.",

            "comment": "Once upon a time when I was in my 20\u2019s I was severely addicted to heroin.  I was homeless, so a friend of my moms let me crash in her empty unit in a building that once functioned as her apartment and hair salon. It was a storefront in a trendy downtown neighborhood in an old, yet updated building. The front of the building held the  salon chairs in a row up front and small bedroom with a bathroom in the back. I brought a mattress inside and got my blankets and headed down for rest in the back bedroom. I woke up around 4 am to use the restroom and had the overwhelming sensation I wasn\u2019t alone. I can\u2019t explain it, it wasn\u2019t blurred by the drugs. I felt it in my spirit. I figured it was because I woke up in a new space and shrugged it off. I went back to the bed and adjusted my eyes to the darkness and I started seeing shadows move on the ceiling. I kept rubbing my eyes and doubting myself.  I figured I was just flipping out because I was sobered up now, scared and alone. This went on the next couple nights, odd creepy feelings in this place, especially being watched, odd shadows on the ceiling, but I was able to get high, sleep and not deal with most of it. I still felt uneasy though. (but when you have a free place to lay your head, have heat, water and do your drugs in peace in, you place that ahead of everything else.) \n\nOne evening, I came back after dancing at a club to support my pitiful habit. I was exhausted, for the most part pretty sober and ready to settle down. I showered, tucked into the bed and was scrolling mindlessly when these weird slapping noises started in the salon room. Sounded like someone was slapping the hardwood flooring. It took every ounce of courage to peek around that corner out into the storefront of chairs. The noise stopped as soon as I got to the doorway. I walked into the salon chair area and noticed an old cable cord coming out of the floor. This was in the area the noise was coming from. I get a terrible gut feeling and I knew damn well I couldn\u2019thandle it if this cable starts moving in front of me, so I fly to the bed and jump in. I was shaking to death. I contemplated running past that room to the back door and to my car. I knew I\u2019d have to put on more layers, grab shoes since it was freezing but sounded too time consuming.  I thought of calling 911 and having them help me, I even had paraphernalia in there too. I didn\u2019t give a damn. I was willing sleep in the winter cold in my vehicle with no gas in it. The Slapping starts again and then I realize it\u2019s definitely that damn cord. Had to be. The sounds made sense for it. It felt like was antagonizing me. I sat there shivering on that stupid mattress listening, head under the blanket, trying to make sense of what is happening. Did someone break in? No. I feel something in here not human, I know it. Then it stops and it\u2019s silence for a good 30 seconds. I just knew in my mind it was making its way in the back bedroom I was in. I feel like it felt me out a few days and was making its move. It was time. All of the sudden I felt a heaviness in the space between myself and the wall, like someone leaning over me, looking.. I knew it was threatening, my insides told me, my fight or flight is kicking in now\u2026. I shit you NOT, I  heard, right in my face, a low growling. I have chills now telling it. It was evil. Pure anger\u2026I flew up screaming like a banshee fighting the air &amp; ran out the back door to my car and cried my eyes out. I made a friend get my things with me. I can\u2019t explain how a presence feels but your soul feels it. High or not. I never suffered hallucinations on opiates. Ever. This was something. \n \nI\u2019m also happy to report I\u2019ve been sober ten years now. I have 4 wonderful kids, I\u2019m a wife and I have become an addictions RN. :)",

Dirt floor, clown paintings in the loft (not even kidding). We stayed up late drinking by the fire and I was the last one awake. Went to go pee on the side of the shop and stood about 5 feet away looking inside through the window. There was a florescent light on and I noticed what looked like a piece of paper or dollar kind of floating around. I thought it was a moth at first but it was moving in a very flowing figure 8 pattern that was very rhythmic. It reminded me of dangling a carrot. I watched it for maybe 20 seconds, which felt like forever. Then it quickly floated back to the corner of the shop where it was dark. There was also a wood chair near the corner that added to the creepiness. Could have been a moth though.\n\nI sat back down by the fire to finish my beer and have a smoke. No one else was awake so I played robot unicorn attack 2 on my phone for a while. I noticed my friend Mark pop out of his tent to pee, then go back in to go to sleep. I decided sleep sounded good, so I went to my tent and fell asleep. The next morning, we were having breakfast and Mark said,\" I saw you guys sitting by the fire super late, how late did you stay up?\" I told him I was probably 2 or 3 am. Then he said,\" who was up with you?\" I told him I was the last man standing. He said,\" I got up to pee and saw you on your phone and 2 people over you're shoulder watching you play\". He said one person looked bigger so he thought it was one of our friends, who was a bigger dude. He said the other person was taller and skinny, but none of us are noticeably tall, or skinny .\n\nFreaked me OUT!! We still camp at that property once a year, but I don't go in the shop, and I go to sleep whenever my wife decides she's tired .",

We went, ran into another family who also was the park same time as us.  Their son was around the same age as my son. They were playing together, and we were just talking.  They went to the playhouse and screamed at the top of their lungs that there's some \"kid\" there with blood all over his face.  Recognizing that they were probably just tired or something, we all go sit in the playhouse with them and reassure them it's nothing.  Suddenly, they both told us that he's standing right there next to us, and we got freaked out and left when their son said that this \"bloodied kid\" apparently was reaching out to us.  During this time, her husband was going around the park scanning everything to make sure there actually wasn't a kid there.  At this point, we thought it would be a great idea to just go home.\n\nWe exchanged numbers, then we just hurried and packed all our belongings to leave.  As we were leaving, one of the swings in the swing set started rapidly swinging beyond what the wind could do.  No, there was no wind there that night.  This individual swing was swinging higher and more aggressively.  We all witnessed this, and just kind of said yup it's time to go.  As I'm pulling out of the park, my son starts screaming, \"He's there, he's coming HE'S COMING MOMMY.\"  Way to freak out the driver, so I was having an anxiety attack, and I have never pulled out of a parking lot so fast before.  Rest of the night, my son clung to me, and refused to leave my side for a moment.  Safe to say I'm never going back to the park at night anymore.",

About a year after we had moved in and my brother moved out to his dad's house my brother decided he had faced enough and decided his own life at his dad's old house.

A few months passed with a couple of those strange happenings we passed off as \"we must have forgot\". \n\nThen one night I was finishing brushing my teeth and getting ready for bed in the bathroom, and my fiance was already laying down in the bedroom, we were yelling jokes at each other from across the hall, my fiance made a joke that reminded me of my brother and I yelled \"your lucky (brothers name) isn't here, he'd get you for that one\" and suddenly the bedroom light flicked on. My fiance kinda nervously laughed and said \"haha real funny where's the remote\" and I poked my head into the bedroom and pointed at the remote that was sitting across the room on my bedside table. My fiance was really uncomfortable after that. I won't lie I was too at the time, but the light has come on a few more times over the last few years, maybe it's a bad wire, or a bad ceiling fan, I don't know, I'm not a believer of the super natural really, but I can't explain it, and if these things really are possible, then I'm just happy to know it means my brother is still around messing with me.",

With the door being in the inside middle of the small section. In the outside corner was the living room.  My roommate had his bedroom at the end of the little part of the L. I walked out of my room to go to the bathroom, no need to turn the light on as this was a trek I had made hundreds of times before.\n\nAs I left the bathroom I turned to go back to my room. Just as I turned off the lights of the bathroom there standing where the short hallway and the living room met there was a teenage girl standing there. Wearing a white flowery dress, just smiling. She didn't look \"evil\" just a normal person standing there smiling at me. I freaked the fuck out and went running for my room.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later I finally came out of my room. Turning all the lights on as I went through the apartment. She was no where to be seen, however where I saw her standing was noticeably colder than the rest of the apartment should have been for an August evening.\n\nCreepy, but not the worst part. I lived there for about another year, and I never saw her again. After I had moved out I was hanging out with my one roommate who had the bedroom at the end of the small hallway, right next to the bathroom. We were talking and I told him that I never felt comfortable in the apartment after something happened. To which he responded \"Oh, you saw her too\" I nearly drove off the road when I heard this. We then both described her, finishing off each others sentences describing her. He had seen her twice. I was indifferent about ghosts before that. Now I believe in them..or believe in something.

            "comment": "When I was 16 or 17 I was home alone with my little sister. We wanted to do something together so I went to my room to get something we needed. My sister waited outside my room. My room is at the far end of the hallway and when standing next to my door you could peek into the kitchen which is on the left hand side on the other end of the hallway.\n\nI got what I needed and came back to my sister staring toward the kitchen with a look of absolute horror on her face. I asked her \"What's wrong?\" and she - still staring down the hallway - whispered \"There is a man standing in the kitchen.\"\n\nI was extremely alerted because me and my younger siblings used to have a stalker not too long ago back then, which was why I carried a knife 24/7. So at that moment the only thing on my mind was \"Shit I need to protect my sister.\" I pulled out my knife, told her to get behind me and headed inside the kitchen (yes I know how absolutely dumb that was). \n\nThere was no one inside the kitchen. I searched the entire house and found no evidence of anyone besides us having been there at all luckily. Scared the shit out of me though.",

            "comment": "So I was living with my ex-gf in Kentucky, near the mountains.  And about twice a week she would go outside with her family, sit on the porch in the dead of night, and just keep watch.  I finally asked her wth was going on by the third time, and it was \"to keep the wendigo and the like away\".   Now, fast forward about 5 months, her family goes on a trip to visit relatives, she goes along and I stay cuz i didn't really mesh with her family, and since they'll be gone a few days, they ask me to put out some candles on the balcony overnight, since they won't be able to. I say sure, and I forgot to do it. Until I woke up around 2am to a very loud scream, and red eyes at our 2nd story bedroom window.  I immediately shat myself and rushed to start lighting candles on the screened porch, turning on all the lights as I go.  I swear to God, I saw something rushing back into the treeline as I started lighting the candles.",

            "comment": "I think I saw myself as an old man after I die. I know I saw something. I was about 9 or 10, and I woke up from a dead sleep and sat straight up. Wide awake. And at the end of my bed was an old man with a short beard, a tweed coat and a hat in one hand, and he was just looking at me. I felt no fear, nothing in me registered \"wtf there's a guy in my room.\" I felt total calm, and he patted his hand at me like, \"lay down now.\" I did, and I fell asleep. \n\nNow, there's zero chance anyone was actually in the house. And no one else ever had any kind of ghostly experience. I suppose there is a chance that it was an extremely vivid and extremely odd dream. But what I've come to think, now many decades later, is that someday I'll die and I'll take a quick peek at young me, just to say, \"it's going to be OK.\" I don't know why I think that. It's just always seemed true. That old man was me, or will be me.",

            "comment": "No I have such a good story.\n\nI grew up in a very old house in the UK, I'm talking 1500's old. This house was opposite a really old church, graveyard AND war memorial. Paranormal things happened all the time throughout all of my childhood, so much that I would become desensitized to things like footsteps, whispers, doors opening/closing.\n\nThe small spooky things used to scare me as a child but as I became a teenager those things would be more of an inconvenience and instead of fear, I'd feel more annoyed- and thus began the weird passive aggressive relationship between me and the ghost(s) of my house. \n\nI think that the ghosts loved scaring me but they couldn't anymore so they really upped their game. About 3 times a week the lights in the house wouldn't work, 3 different electricians told us that nothing was wrong with our lights (the lights would also miraculously work when the sparkys came). I wasn't a fan of being mugged off by ghosts.\n\nThey also started waiting for me to walk towards doors and reach for the handles before slamming the doors just before I could open them, this would make me jump and I could tell they'd enjoy it. So I started kicking doors shut very dramatically before opening them to take away their satisfaction and saying something like \"saved you a job\".\n\nThen they would start moving things on tables in front of me (only when I was alone, typical). It was always things like glasses and mugs so I'd be worried about them smashing on the floor, so I'd rush to catch them. I think they'd enjoy watching me lunge for the objects. So I started using only plastic cups, they'd knock the cups off the table and I'd just watch, unamused, and say something like \"oooh big man\" sarcastically.\n\nThey really began to up their game and started locking doors/ rattling doors loudly. I ended up carrying my keys around my house at all times to unlock doors, and punching rattling doors and shouting profanities.\n\nUnfortunately me and the ghost's back and forth couldn't last forever and I eventually had to move to be closer to work. The week before I left things got crazy. Out of respect I would act scared at everything as a sort of \"last hurrah\". It was weird having such a weird relationship with something paranormal for so long, then leaving.\n\n I sometimes think about the house and wonder how it's doing with the new family in there, I hope it got some good scares.",

Not only their existence, but the amount of them that you see everywhere.\n\nTo them, vehicles would be such a foreign, alien concept. A mental contraption that seemingly everybody owns, that travels at speeds far faster than any speed obtainable from the time travellers time period.\n\nSeeing roads full of hundreds of cars zooming by would be a shock.",

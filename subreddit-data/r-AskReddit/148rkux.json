The crush faded, I mean I was still attracted to him but I found other people to have a crush on. Eventually when I was a Sophomore and he was a Junior, I just messaged him on Facebook (we were Facebook friends), we chatted for a bit and I just told him I\u2019ve always had a crush on him. He was really nice about it and just was like awe that\u2019s sweet but I\u2019m just not looking for anything right now. I told him I understand and if he ever needed anything I would be willing to help. He appreciated it and I moved on, around half a year later he got with a different girl in my grade. \n\nIt\u2019s only been a few years, but you know maybe one day when he will message and be like \u201cyou know maybe we could give this a shot\u201d but I doubt it which is fine",

We just kinda clicked and everything felt so natural between us. He dropped many hints that he was interested over the years but growing up i was super not confident in myself (still not lmao) and i thought it was litterally impossible for a guy to reciprocate my feelings. We remained friends pretty much all through high school... I always wished we tried a relationship but by the time something did happen in-between us it was in the beginning of the fuck boy era \ud83e\udd72 so he ended up using me (just a bj) and then was on so many other girls that same week. We dont talk anymore.",

We'd just hangout in the after school program but after like 3rd grade, despite going to a smaller midle and high school didn't interact much until sophomore or junior year, when some kid who had gone to 2nd grade with contacted both of us, he told me he wanted to make amends cause apparently she and I bullied him though I barely remember him and he had told her to show up so he could 1. Confess his feelings for her and 2. Kick my ass and \"win the girl\". That was the last time we had a conversation.",

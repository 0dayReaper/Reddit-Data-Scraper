It also needs a lot of natural resources and good ocean access. Brazil has two of them and could grow the population, but it's complete inability to get out of its own way and get stuff done is stopping it.",

They needed the income from the manufacturing to pay for the navy and colonial enterprises. Their population wasn't small by world standards at the time as a lot of modern countries were split between a lot of smaller entities then.",

It tells the social and political story behind the run up to WWI and how the battleship race with Germany fueled the push for war. It's also by implication the story of the end of Britain's supremacy as Germany built their manufacturing up and started selling their Wotan armor plate. Plus lots of good stuff about Churchill who is one of my favorite persons from history.",

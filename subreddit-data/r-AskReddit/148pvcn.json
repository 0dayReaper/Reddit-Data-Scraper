It also needs a lot of natural resources and good ocean access. Brazil has two of them and could grow the population, but it's complete inability to get out of its own way and get stuff done is stopping it.",

They needed the income from the manufacturing to pay for the navy and colonial enterprises. Their population wasn't small by world standards at the time as a lot of modern countries were split between a lot of smaller entities then.",

Each project uses a massive excel sheet with tabs for every month, columns for every day of the month, rows containing the 400+ items ...and a matching parallel grid for their cost effect.  They all reference each other and compile on the yearly split by months page, then again on the main summary page of the sheet. \n\nTotal shitshow. It's sooo slow, even on my gaming computer at home. Instead of typing in the item number and then a quantity, you scroll and scroll until you get to the item then trace across and try to line it up with the day of the month. No way to build a history of that item without scrolling through each tab and recording it yourself.  Drop one thing in the wrong cell and it's all fucked and there's likely not a way to figure it out besides repopulating the entire month/day with the field recorded quantities.\n\nThe IT grunts hate dealing with it, we hate using it, there's database softwares designed especially for this...but no \"excel works fine just use it\"",

He said that by colour coding everything you understood the material better because you had to think about it longer to colour code it and understand what other things it was associated with. Not just zone out and go into transcribing mode. He also made us do end of unit study guides. They had to be colour coded,  a set amount of drawings, and unit words and definitions. The drawings were doodles based on things in the unit. He would mark them and hand them back before the test which was great because he knew if he needed to help us with something before we bombed the test. He was also a mma fighter with cauliflower ears and not the type of guy you would expect to demand rainbow coloured notes.\n\nEdit: There's a lot of people asking for examples so I'll make one up this afternoon.",

By making the learning multimodal, you are adding multiple areas of encoding, and creating links between the nodes where the memory resides.  \n\nI was a STEM/PreMed major and then grad school...not med school!  And weirdly, almost everyone I knew that was getting A's had similar learning strategies.  A lot of them used colored pencils...I'm looking down at my desk and I have a Red/Blue pencil right next to me (its different colors on both sides)...I print out papers I'm working on and use it to mark things up these days -- I used to do it on my tablet, but this is actually quicker.  In the end, little things like this make you more efficient...\n\nThen again, it's monday and I've been on Reddit all day, so what do I know about efficiency!",

                    "comment": "Also have horrible ADHD. When I was in college, I HAD to write notes by hand, even for things that the professor said I didn't need to write down. Because if I let myself stop taking notes, I'd stop paying attention, and when he switched back to the important shit I'd forget to start again.\n\nI also had to doodle a lot in the margins. Ironically, doodling helped keep me present in the moment instead of off in my own head. It kept keep me grounded to the real world. \n\nBut, one of the funny things I would do a lot, was write what the current time was in the margins. So for a block of notes I'd have like [11:45] written in the margin, then [12:00] in the next section, etc. I didn't even really realize I was doing it, but one day I loaned my notes to someone to copy and she laughed because she thought I was doing it on purpose to keep track of how long the professor spent on each subject to categorize by importance or something. Nope, just trying not to start thinking about how the universe works in my sociology class.",

The best method they found to keep their attention was to keep them blindfolded but let them doodle on paper while listening to the teacher. Although you might not have been blindfolded, I still think it\u2019s interesting that even at higher academic levels doodling can help students pay attention.",

I especially like the idea of colors being associated with ideas, personalities, names or themes. \u201cOh, today is Monday. I think orange is a good Monday color. Pink is Friday. Green is Wednesday.\u201d I love how Windows 10 allows me to change the colors of tiles so that my computer seems more like \u201cme.\u201d I am constantly changing the colors of my Apple watch face. \n\nI dunno. I think I have a problem!\n\nETA: The thoughts and discussions being shared here have been very interesting and eye-opening! Thanks for the silver as well. :) I do just want to add that I am fairly certain I do not have synesthesia. I know someone that does and from my very limited knowledge of it, it isn\u2019t a voluntary association of colors like mine probably would be. I always automatically like to associate stuff with color or mood, but I don\u2019t know that it happens involuntarily. Think of what I do as more of what happens in the video game Persona 5, where each character has a color associated with them intentionally. I love that kind of stuff!",

I also like having a bunch of colors for seminar speakers because it somehow keeps me more interested to choose a different color for a different speaker.\n\nHonestly though, the core reason is the main reason I enjoy multiple colors is because I often feel the secret to success against procrastination is negotiating with your inner five year old.  \"Ok, you need to write these notes, but if you *do* you can choose what color to write them in!\"  You might as well find a little happiness in the world where you can. :)",

I have one mechanical pencil for sketches, a red ultrafine Sharpie, and a China marker that I carry in my gear bag for when I need options. \n\nI use different colored sticky notes at my desk to somewhat color code. Yellow for everyday shit, but green are the important things. \n\nAm in the law enforcement field. I buy my own pens because I'm picky. Quartermaster only gives out the worst plastic black ink crappy pens. I also buy my own blue twin tip sharpies. These are the best! The ultrafine point is amazing for labeling swab boxes and little stuff. The fine point is great for signing tape seals on my evidence and the bigger stuff.",

Have a nice day :)\n\nI color-coded my notes. I have OCD and it makes everything feel neater and easier to flick through. If you want, I'll give my system as I found it to be very useful, maybe you will too. Oh, and I am currently unemployed but due to the recent birth of my son, James, I've been looking into jobs :)\n\nOr, an alternative way. I use black for titles and subtitles, as, for me, the title isn't that important. The dates are written in a subtle color, because the focus should be on the stuff below. I'm not focusing on the title, more on the definitions, key words, diagrams, instructions etc. Blue is the most used, as that's usually what I use for simple stuff. Red is used for diagrams, definitions and instructions and research shows that red helps with more detailed information than blue. Also, red is cool. I highlight key words in pastel pink because it looks pretty with blue and highlight in pastel orange because fire and shit. As for the summary, I write it in grey with a black border. It's a lot but I mainly just focus on aesthetic more than anything.",

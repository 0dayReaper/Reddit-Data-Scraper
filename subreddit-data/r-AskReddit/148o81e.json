The officer, Mark Furman, who found all the evidence was on tape using the nword countless times, saying how much he hated nword and saying how he planted evidence on nword all the time to send them to jail.  That tape was played in court for the jury.\n\nEither you believe in America or you don't.  Hell, in any country's justice system this would have been enough to discount all evidence and give reasonable doubt.  OJ cutting those people's heads off became irrelevant to whether he should or should not have been acquitted.  It would have been flat out racist to ignore the racist cop who found all the evidence saying he plants evidence on nword all the time because he hates black people, that there was not a reasonable doubt.\n\nI cheered.  I still do.  Sucks a murderer went free but I'm not the one who hires the KKK to police LA",

I wasn\u2019t asleep though.. then I start to hear the gf moaning a little. I can hear them fucking and it was soo hot that I sneakily got my cock out and jerked myself while listening to them. I came hard..",

Bed frames were sideways and the mattresses were on the floor.\n\nI participated and took down a guy over a foot taller than me. God it was fun",

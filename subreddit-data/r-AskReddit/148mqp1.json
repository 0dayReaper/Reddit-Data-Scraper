            "comment": "I never thought I would be the kind of guy to snoop through someone's phone, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off with my ex. She had called me drunk out of her mind to tell me she was going to sleep over at her bff's house because she was so blasted and didn't want to drive. Her story just didn't add up, because usually, she would call me to pick her up if she had too much to drink. So, I did some detective work and used the \"find my iPhone\" from iTunes on our home PC, to see where she was so I could go pick her up.\n\nIt was a gut-wrenching feeling to see that she was at her ex's apartment, just a few blocks away from our house. I felt like I had been stabbed in the heart. All the excuses and lies she had fed me suddenly made sense. She wasn't just hanging out with her female friend like she said. She was sleeping with her ex.\n\nI didn't hesitate. I got dressed and drove to his place. As I knocked on the door, my heart was pounding in my chest. When he opened the door, I saw her lying on his bed, naked and sweaty. The sight made me nauseous.\n\nI had planned to pick her up that night, worried about her driving after a night of drinking. But instead, I found her, freshly fucked and probably still drunk, at her ex's place. I didn't even know what to say, I just turned around and walked away, feeling like a fool for trusting her.\n\nShe tried to explain, but I couldn't listen. I couldn't believe the lies that had come out of her mouth. She had betrayed me in the worst way possible. I left without saying a word, feeling hurt and angry.\n\nI couldn't believe it had ended this way. But sometimes, the truth hurts.",

When I'm reading these stories I feel the same way as the people getting cheated on. I don't know why, but I know it's also a good thing I feel this way",

So as I am swiping thru them I guess I got to the end because it was a photo of a naked women with a gaping asshole being used as a cereal bowl and another girl eating the cereal out of her bootyhole bowl. Looked liked like a screen shot of a video because of motion blur. I was so surprised my jaw dropped and I just starred\u2026\u2026 I said what the fuck is this and he was very flustered and grabbed the phone and yelled nothing! I said it\u2019s cool man whack it to whatever you want I would suggest keeping it away from photos you are showing people tho. We have since laughed about it",

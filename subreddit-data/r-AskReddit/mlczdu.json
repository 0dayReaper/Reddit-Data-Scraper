Does it count if you just look at all the characters? You could die before finishing it, and you'd be lonely, frustrated, and bored until then.\n\nEdit: People. This post is over a week old. To address some repeating comments:\n\nI've already explained how you ***could*** (not would) still die. Time doesn't stop *for you*, or else you wouldn't be able to read, meaning you age and need to eat/drink as well, and if time is stopped *for everything but you, can you still eat things* operating at \"absolute zero\" on an atomic level?. How does time work for everything, including you, in this situation? \n\nI've already explained how the \"ancient Chinese manuscript\" was an extreme example. The same situation applies to *anyone who can't read anything*, people who can't read other languages (or even written word), and people slow to learn. What does it mean to \"read\"? What if you physically, educationally, or developmentally *can't*?\n\nHopefully this curbs the \"but you wouldn't die/ ancient manuscripts is bull\" comments. I was hoping for more conversation on the \"monkey's paw\"/ grey area aspects. That's what makes these posts fun!\n\n\nEdit 2: This is what I responded to:\n&gt;So I can move freely when time is frozen? Or am I stuck there reading? Cuz if it's the former what's the problem? If the latter I can learn a lot of skills easily. Or freeze time by touching clifford and having a nap\n\nWe're both looking forward to conversation, not just shooting down a premise.",

If I touched a book, for instance, written in Japanese, a language I have zero frame of reference to understand, I would absorb the knowledge of the information in the book immediately. But, I would not then be able to read it since I can\u2019t read Japanese. So would time stay frozen until I could get my hands on several volumes of books teaching me Japanese, all the way from novice to expert so that I could then go back and read the original book that I had touched? To further this, what if I touched this original book in Japanese out in a cabin in the middle of nowhere? How could I go about obtaining books on teaching me that language so that I could read the original text? This could conceivably take years of my life.",

If you're stuck not being able to do anything at all but stare at the book, you'd be pretty screwed with some languages. Could maybe puzzle things out eventually if the language is related to one you know (e.g. if you speak Italian and the book is in another Romance language like Spanish or French), but with a difference as significant as that between English and Chinese I'm not sure there's any way you could figure it out even with effectively infinite time.",

You\u2019d effectively be perpetually stuck in frozen time if you ever touch a book otherwise. \n\nThat said, I think your other point demonstrates something more ambiguous about this prompt. If your own personal time remains unfrozen while the rest of time is frozen, do you age? Because if so, this is the opposite of immortality: you could read a book, spent 40 years in frozen time, and instantly appear 40 years older to anyone observing you (as their time would have been frozen while you aged). \n\nWhen I read this, I interpreted it similarly to the person you responded to: that time overall would freeze, aside from my own personal time\u2014and that I wouldn\u2019t age while that time was frozen. But now I see that there is another way that prompt could be interpreted.",

Like would two copies of the same book require me to read both cover-to-cover even if the only difference is that one of them has a different blurb, praise page, and a forward? What about books I can't read because they're in a different language?

If you are required to learn and retain 100% of the information in order to unfreeze time then it's definitely a curse. Even more so if you need to understand what that info means.\n\nMaybe you could memorize the contents of a short book written in a language you don't speak, but if understanding is required then I hope that you are prepared to learn a new language from books alone.",

            "comment": "The Daily Telegraph Crossword Puzzle Security Alarm.\n\nSee, the Daily Telegraph had some rather interesting words in it during World War 2. There was that one time when the word Dieppe showed up the day before the Dieppe Raid, for instance. However, in the lead up to D-Day, over 4 weeks that came before it, the following words appeared in various crossword puzzles within the Daily Telegraph:  \n\n\nNeptune (The operation to free France from nazi occupation)  \nOverlord (The operation of landing in occupied France, generally known as D-Day)  \nGold, Juno, Utah, Sword, Omaha (the five landing beaches during D-Day)  \nAnd Mulberry (Floating harbors constructed to make unloading troops easier once the beaches are taken)\n\nTurns out, all of these words were put in there not by some german spy network communicating sensitive information through crossword puzzles, but by sheer coincidence.",

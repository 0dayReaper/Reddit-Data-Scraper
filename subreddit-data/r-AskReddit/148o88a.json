Trump could dismiss his detail, like Nixon did, but he won't.\n\nMy guess is that the Secret Service would contract out to the prison to protect the former President. The Secret Service would then have to fund that contract, so this could get quite lucrative.",

Even though he was a billionaire, his home confinement was still pretty fucking shitty.\n\nEssentially being confined to a suite at a hotel. Like it's glamorous, nice, but it's still technically a prison. He had to pay for a detail of marshalls to watch him. Couldn't have booze, they monitored stuff.\n\nLike a really elaborate form of being grounded, with the addition of strangers with guns in your house.\n\n\"Oh leaving your room to go to the bathroom? Travis will keep an eye on you.\"\n\n\"Going to the kitchen to get a snack? Alex is just gonna check the take out box to make sure there's no contraband.\"\n\nlong story short if it happened to Trump, he'd hate it. Visitors are restricted, can't leave, constant people telling him no. It's not prison in a traditional sense, but it'd get the job done.",

Because the founding fathers have already rolled over in their graves. \n\nIf we don\u2019t actually nail this son of a bitch like we used to do to traitors than this will merely happen again and it will be someone even more competent than trump. This shouldn\u2019t be a right or left side issue. No party should be able to let a president get away with what he did. From both investigations and the terrorist attack on Jan 6. \n\nBut I guess rural redneck folks are laughing at the suckers and losers who fought for this country so we didn\u2019t have to deal with terrorism and traitors. They would rather eat the ass of a man who not only called soldiers suckers and losers. But is the only president to say he will take guns without due process. While a rally of his fans cheered. \n\nAnd y\u2019all wonder why y\u2019all get called dumb. You don\u2019t even stand behind the shit you whine about so dearly.",

He would be isolated and secret service assigned as usual, except that instead of being on an airplane or Mar a lago their shifts would take place in the prison. They wouldn\u2019t be inside the cell, but nearby. Outside to prevent someone from hurting him.",

Here\u2019s why: a person who has an extensive knowledge of top-secret information that has demonstrated that they are willing to share that information with people who are not supposed to have it are a national security risk.\n\nwhen the spy, Robert Hansen was incarcerated, he spent 23 years in solitary confinement. You can\u2019t just wander around doing your own thing when you are convicted of something like that.\n\nFurther, we protect our previous presidents. You can\u2019t get much more protected than solitary confinement. there is no need for Secret Service agents in SuperMax.",

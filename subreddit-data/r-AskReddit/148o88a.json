Trump could dismiss his detail, like Nixon did, but he won't.\n\nMy guess is that the Secret Service would contract out to the prison to protect the former President. The Secret Service would then have to fund that contract, so this could get quite lucrative.",

Even though he was a billionaire, his home confinement was still pretty fucking shitty.\n\nEssentially being confined to a suite at a hotel. Like it's glamorous, nice, but it's still technically a prison. He had to pay for a detail of marshalls to watch him. Couldn't have booze, they monitored stuff.\n\nLike a really elaborate form of being grounded, with the addition of strangers with guns in your house.\n\n\"Oh leaving your room to go to the bathroom? Travis will keep an eye on you.\"\n\n\"Going to the kitchen to get a snack? Alex is just gonna check the take out box to make sure there's no contraband.\"\n\nlong story short if it happened to Trump, he'd hate it. Visitors are restricted, can't leave, constant people telling him no. It's not prison in a traditional sense, but it'd get the job done.",

Being yelled at terrified me because I'm sensitive to noise and can have what's called a meltdown, which is like a fusion between a mental breakdown and panic attack, if I'm exposed to too much of it.\n\nAlso, being a gifted kid has made me terrified of failure and hold really high standards for my school work.\n\nIf you were to take any advice from me, I'd say this: School is going to make you hate yourself and everyone around you. You will shudder at the thought of it as an adult and dread when your own children go there. But you can either try to make the most of it and find some sort of interest in the topics or wallow in the pain and regret not working hard later in life when your options are more limited. If you distract yourself with work for long enough, you can get to a situation where you can make enough money for therapy. Because in our world, everyone needs it.",

It is great to dream big and have goals but if you never put forth any effort or create and plan then it is unlikely you will achieve those goals. \n\nAlso, I almost failed college my 2nd year. It made me feel terrible and depressed so the experience of failure definitely brought a lot of clarity. \n\nI'm personally not motivated by money but rather the lifestyle I am trying to achieve.",

When there's tangible short-term consequences looming then it can really kick me into gear, but other than that it can be *really* hard to get on with stuff - like homework assignments, I'm woefully behind, or revision (which I really should be doing instead of browsing reddit, I have 3 more exams this week, but the consequences are all the way in *August*). \n\nIf you're looking for advice, I'd say you need to get someone who you respect properly on your case and ready to give consequences to not getting on with the work.",

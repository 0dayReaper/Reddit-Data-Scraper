The excitement of people on the train or in the store.  It was whimsical!\n\nI remember walking all the way to Liberty State Park because it was the only place to find Eevee. I went several times and each time only found one. \n\nThank god eggs came along.",

Now if only they'd done a better job at keeping peoples' interest.\n\nI still don't get how the original distance tracking feature broke, or why it's taken going on four years to add a few hundred pokemon.  The models already exist!",

It sounds like the game is pretty good now, but it\u2019s far too late to recuperate it\u2019s momentary success.\n\nAnd given that not every Pok\u00e9mon will be in the upcoming Sword/Shield, those existing models don\u2019t seem to be keen on actually being used.",

You could just walk up to strangers and talk, the whole street was filled with people all doing the exact same thing without any organised event. \n\nMy brother, sister, a few friends and I would all drive around slowly in the back streets with pokestops and slow down with our windows down past any groups of people walking with their phones out blasting the Pok\u00e9mon theme, trying to look all gangsta. We\u2019d ask what team they were in and if they weren\u2019t ours we\u2019d speed off. Was always fun seeing people\u2019s reactions lol.",

Almost every new car from the decade is elaborately styled. Car interiors with angular, intricate dashboards (like the Ford Escape, Chevy Equinox or Hyundai Santa Fe). This might end in the 2020s as crash safety technology requires more new cars to look the same, and car interiors will replace dashboards and gauges with touch screens (Thanks, Tesla).\n\n* A move away from chain restaurants and the rise of food trucks and locally-owned restaurants that all feature string lighting, outdoor tables with giant Jenga blocks, Edison bulbs, and a craft beer selection written on a chalkboard.\n\n* All houses are painted in that \u201cgriege\u201d color and have all-white kitchens with that same white subway tile backsplash.

                    "comment": "Chapter 7: \"**Memes** were the quintessential milennial mode of expression, akin to the hieroglyphics of Egypt and the cuneiform tablets of Sumer. Early 21st century internet savants populated their Facebook feeds with fan favorites such as Lolcats and Philosoraptor. As the trend caught on, memes diversified and developed, getting adopted by such institutions as politics, academia, and post-modern avant-garde expressionism. As memes became more sophisticated, so too did their influence over society. The charged political landscape ignited a trend of weaponizing them for political use, culminating into the bloody **Meme Wars of 2028**.\"",

                    "comment": "A YouTuber pointed this out very clearly. He gave the example of the Nike \"Betsy Ross\" shoe controversy. He showed how this was a planned incident to increase sales for Nike. Why did Nike come out and basically say \"Sorry we are recalling all of the Betsy Ross shoes because Colin Kaepernick thinks they might be offensive\". Even if true, why not just try and silently recall them or just make up a simple excuse? Why? Because that faux incident will cause outrage which will drive up sales for Nike by the group of people that need to \"stand up to injustice and get those bad people that oppose this\".\nOn the flip side of this is the other companies cashing in on it as well. They are the ones saying \"Don't put up with this Colin Kaepernick crap! Show him and Nike that you really hate them by buying a Betsy Ross shirt and hat from us\". So it sells on both ends and companies are laughing all of the way to the bank. Outrage sells more than ever now days.\n\nEdit - Here is the link of the video I referenced https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEN8RBSwnnk&amp;list=LL-WuJTf8NGtCPRsWX_ZGAHg&amp;index=12&amp;t=0s",

I appreciate every single one of you for that. I'll give a general answer to a lot of questions then respond to everybody individually. Yes, I'm doing a lot better. I do still drink, but a lot less than I used to. Now, a 12 pack would take me a couple of days. Used to be a couple of hours. \n\nOnce again, please be safe with alcohol. Just because it's legal doesn't always make it a good decision.\n\nDOUBLE EDIT!!! If someone you care about is an alcoholic, try to reach out to them. Sometimes we don't realize how bad we are until the people we love most desert us, which usually leads to an even worse cycle of abuse. If you are an alcoholic and want to stop or at least slow down, my best advice is to find someone else who is and also wants to improve themselves. Actively listen to them when they share their feelings, and expect the same from them when you share yours. It's not easy, but who ever said that improving your life was?\n\nAA can work for some, group settings can work for some, other options can work for some. Find what works best for you. Will you fail? Most likely. I did several times. I'm still not fully sober. But that first step and COMMITMENT to it is the most important part.\n\nAlright, I'll step down off of my soap box and leave you all with the quote that's kept me going most:\n\n\"Why do we fall? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.\"",

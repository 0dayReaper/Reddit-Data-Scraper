I hope that degree bought a hell of a career.\n\nPeople (read parents and high school and undergraduate educators) really need to stop pressuring kids to go to college (or an advanced degree program) as a matter of course, and start encouraging them to critically analyze education options as an investment.\n\nRight now we leave it to college recruiters to educate kids on the ROI of the degrees they are selling, and the conflict of interest is huge. I know a lot of MBAs with a lot of student debt who were promised the moon and are only making $60-80k at jobs they could have gotten without a bachelors degree.",

Any degree.\" Prior to the great recession, any college degree anywhere was enough to pretty much guarantee you a high paying job. Suddenly, it wasn't. Now, post great-recession, it still isn't. But that doesn't help the millions of millenials who had already graduated college or were already in college when the great recession hit in 2008/9. \n\nGranted, yes, unless you're a trust fund baby or on a free ride, pretty much everyone agrees that anyone in college NOW for a degree in philosophy or art or whatever and is taking out loans for it is making a HUGE FINANCIAL MISTAKE and HOLY SHIT DOES NO ONE LOVE YOU ENOUGH TO TELL YOU HOW STUPID YOU'RE BEING but we have an entire *generation* of kids where that wasn't the case.",

You have to own the company to \"make bank\" and even then most of them just do alright. Mowing and installation make around $15/hr, with mowing making less in my experience. Foremans may make a bit more, but still. If you're going to go into the business, pay your time at the bottom to learn installation, save your money, learn the business while you're at the bottom, and then start a company. \n\nI will say that it's probably the easiest trade to start a business in, but it's pretty competitive.",

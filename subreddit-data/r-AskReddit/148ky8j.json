I'll start with my most recent ones.\nSo back in September I was at a park near my house and I saw a kid (4ish) who was waving around a metal pipe at kids who were trying to go down a specific slide. I was going to walk over to him and tell him to stop. I walk over to him, we make eye contact for a second, and in the blink of an eye, he hits me right above my eye and below my eyebrow. I had to go to the ER. No serious injuries BUT if it had hit about a centimeter lower, I would've lost my eye. \nMy next story is a bit more severe. I was on a camping trip with my friend Elijah, his family, and my family. We brought our bikes because there was bike trails and hey, biking is fun. On the last day, my mom and dad are packing up and they have me go find something to do. So I grab my bike and a helmet. Basically, there is a hill, a little valley, and a hill. So I go down the hill and make it to the valley. Then I decide to go back down the hill. This time though, luck is not on my side and I crash my bike. I scar my arm, left thumb, and knee. I also break tissue in my cheek (we didn't find that out until later). If I didn't decide to grab my helmet. I wouldn't be here writing this post. \nI'm okay now, but I do have scars from both of those events. I now consider late 2022 as the most painful months of my life (so far).",

I really was not thinking. The glue gun needed more glue, and I just inserted the glue stick into the glue gun (while holding a conversation) without thinking about the small bit of glue still in the glue gun.  Not only was I adding a new glue stick, but I was pushing out the remainder of the nearly empty one. So I got extremely hot glue all over my thigh. I panicked and tried to wipe the glue off my thigh with my palm, which then burned my palm of my dominant hand. It made everything painful to do for a solid 3 weeks. \n\n2. My dog accidentally scratched my eyeball. I\u2019ve never experienced a scratch on my eye like this before. I was convinced it was a cornea scratch (thankfully it wasn\u2019t). I had to wait for someone to help take me to the doctor because I couldn\u2019t stop tearing up and I couldn\u2019t see in my eye. Then I had severe light sensitivity.

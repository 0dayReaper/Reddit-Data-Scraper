I'll start with my most recent ones.\nSo back in September I was at a park near my house and I saw a kid (4ish) who was waving around a metal pipe at kids who were trying to go down a specific slide. I was going to walk over to him and tell him to stop. I walk over to him, we make eye contact for a second, and in the blink of an eye, he hits me right above my eye and below my eyebrow. I had to go to the ER. No serious injuries BUT if it had hit about a centimeter lower, I would've lost my eye. \nMy next story is a bit more severe. I was on a camping trip with my friend Elijah, his family, and my family. We brought our bikes because there was bike trails and hey, biking is fun. On the last day, my mom and dad are packing up and they have me go find something to do. So I grab my bike and a helmet. Basically, there is a hill, a little valley, and a hill. So I go down the hill and make it to the valley. Then I decide to go back down the hill. This time though, luck is not on my side and I crash my bike. I scar my arm, left thumb, and knee. I also break tissue in my cheek (we didn't find that out until later). If I didn't decide to grab my helmet. I wouldn't be here writing this post. \nI'm okay now, but I do have scars from both of those events. I now consider late 2022 as the most painful months of my life (so far).",

I really was not thinking. The glue gun needed more glue, and I just inserted the glue stick into the glue gun (while holding a conversation) without thinking about the small bit of glue still in the glue gun.  Not only was I adding a new glue stick, but I was pushing out the remainder of the nearly empty one. So I got extremely hot glue all over my thigh. I panicked and tried to wipe the glue off my thigh with my palm, which then burned my palm of my dominant hand. It made everything painful to do for a solid 3 weeks. \n\n2. My dog accidentally scratched my eyeball. I\u2019ve never experienced a scratch on my eye like this before. I was convinced it was a cornea scratch (thankfully it wasn\u2019t). I had to wait for someone to help take me to the doctor because I couldn\u2019t stop tearing up and I couldn\u2019t see in my eye. Then I had severe light sensitivity.

            "comment": "when i was 7, my family &amp; I were about to leave for VBS and I wanted to press the garage door opener button. but for some reason back then I\u2019d leave my shoes in my mom\u2019s car instead of wearing them into the house. so since i was 7, I was like 4 feet tall so I had to jump up to push the button, my older brother (was like 9 at the time) he liked to take apart electronics and has recently taken apart a DVD player and it was put in the garage below the garage opener button. being 7, I didn\u2019t know what it was but I used it to step on so I could reach the button when I jumped up, when I landed I slid &amp; my big toe slid across the sharp edge and it sliced my toe open, it went through the tendons &amp; down to the bone. i don\u2019t remember what it looked like but my mom says it was hanging on by a thread so I was rushed to the ER. and now i can no longer bend my big toe bc they couldn\u2019t save the tendons \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

            "comment": "I was raised being told that i was 1/8th native american, which was believable because my father is kind of dark and I'm pale but with dark features. There was a whole story about how my great great grandmother kidnapped a native American boy and gave him the identity of her deceased son so as not to be discovered as being native American, and that when he enlisted in the military he enlisted as native American but the records were destroyed in a fire. Did a DNA test, and not only do we have zero native american genetics, there was also absolutely no explanation for why my father is darker skinned. We figured Greek would have been on the list but nope, just European non-greek mutts. Where this family story originated is beyond me, but with my family I'm honestly not even surprised.",

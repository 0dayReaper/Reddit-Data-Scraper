I think HL 2 is a better game but I still pick the original because of the nostalgia and memories. \n\nWe had a home computer when I was a kid, but my parents wouldn't buy us a console so I would check out PC games from the local library. I was able to install several that could run without the disc so unless the computer crashed or was erased I had a bunch of games for free.",

And there was weird life that only existed around these vents, and would move or die if the vents stopped. So yes, there's likely to be some form of extraterrestrial life, if life can form on this planet in what would be deemed inhospitable for some lifeforms on that planet, then there's likely to be life out there. Plus water is known to be one of the building blocks, and it's on a bunch of the moons in the solar system, and planets.\n\nIt's just not likely to look like something from a Men In Black movie.",

Even *if* one of them had intelligent life, the only way we would ever see it is if life in both planets evolved on a roughly similar timeline, and along similar evolutionary paths, neither of which we have any reason to believe has occurred. Then they would need to develop as a social species, then society, then through technological revolutions, then become spacefaring, then identify Earth as a planet similar to theirs, then figure out Light Speed travel for a 100 year journey just to make contact.\n\nWe still haven't set foot on another planet in our own solar system. If we're nowhere close to leaving our system, why do we expect that alien life should he able to find us?",

And there was weird life that only existed around these vents, and would move or die if the vents stopped. So yes, there's likely to be some form of extraterrestrial life, if life can form on this planet in what would be deemed inhospitable for some lifeforms on that planet, then there's likely to be life out there. Plus water is known to be one of the building blocks, and it's on a bunch of the moons in the solar system, and planets.\n\nIt's just not likely to look like something from a Men In Black movie.",

Even *if* one of them had intelligent life, the only way we would ever see it is if life in both planets evolved on a roughly similar timeline, and along similar evolutionary paths, neither of which we have any reason to believe has occurred. Then they would need to develop as a social species, then society, then through technological revolutions, then become spacefaring, then identify Earth as a planet similar to theirs, then figure out Light Speed travel for a 100 year journey just to make contact.\n\nWe still haven't set foot on another planet in our own solar system.

Not in our lifetimes, most likely, if ever.\n\nFrom what we know about life, it sprung up almost as soon as conditions on Earth allowed it. That should tell us that simple life in the universe is very common. However, more complex, multicellular life took ages. Most of the time life has existed on the planet has been pre mitochondrial symbiosis which is what gave us the energy needed to for into more complex life. Had it taken 1.5 times as long or twice as long... even 1.3 times longer, we would not have intelligent life on earth. The sun would have expanded and rendered Earth uninhabitable for complex life.\n\nWhat can we take from all that? Life is probably really common. Complex life is probably exceedingly rare.\n\nI think a lot of people also often see evolution as a climb towards intelligent life, but evolution isn't 'smart' like that. It doesn't care about what we consider 'advanced,' in fact, from an evolutionary standpoint, something like an ant or a fruit fly is far more advanced and successful than we are. Evolution only cares about an organism's ability to procreate. It's not a machine that makes intelligence. If anything, intelligence was a sort of happy accident for us.\n\nNext, people need to consider time and location. Too slow means life succumbs to the changing environment in its solar system. And once it is capable of interstellar bio-markers, that needs to fall into the timeline of the universe where another civilization is technologically advanced enough to detect them. Over the course of the universe, dozens of intelligent civilizations might pop up in eachothers' neighborhood, always separated by so much time as to never be able to detect one another before one goes extinct.\n\nIt is ridiculous to think that within the universe we are, have been or will be the only intelligent life. What's not ridiculous is to believe we are the only intelligent life that exists within our sphere of detection during the 100-ish years we've actually been able to look.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if we found life, or proof it once existed on Venus, Mars, Enceladus or Europa. I would be surprised if humans, should we end up surviving, encountered intelligent life within the next couple thousand years.",

Turns-out, planets are pretty common.  I believe one day we'll detect life on another planet, perhaps thru its effect on a planet's atmosphere.",

People like to say the universe if vast and the odds are possible, but if you don't know the odds you can't say that. Hypothetically you can play the lottery a septillion times and only win once if the odds are 1 in an octillion. You can't just say \"there are so many tickets out there, there has to be more winners\" if you don't know the odds of winning in the first place.",

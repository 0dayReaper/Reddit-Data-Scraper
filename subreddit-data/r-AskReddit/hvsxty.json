Guy freaks out and remembers the emergency box and figures now should be an emergency and figures maybe the guy left access info to offsite backups or tape drives or some sort of disaster recovery and goes into the server room.

Graphic depictions of what he was going to do to me that went way beyond what a child like him should be able to envision (he was a 1st grader). Talked about the different ways his pets died, but looking nearly cheerful about it. I was injured several times that year. To this day I tense when I hear his name or anyone speak in the same distinctive sounding speech pattern he had (think Hannibal Lecter with the ebbs and flows that are just a little jarring). I once ran into him at a grocery store and still won't go there. I'm afraid he's going to recognize my car even though I haven't seen him in 3 years. I was put on him because I was the only one who could keep him even a little bit in line, and that was only because I was willing to give him exactly zero strikes. It was exhausting and I was seriously relieved when I got a different job.\n\nI've worked with kids who are a handful before. If you work with them close enough you usually figure out what triggering their behavior: problems at home, trying to fit in with a crowd, etc. Even if you didn't know it usually became obvious when something was about to trigger them, you figured out Bobby clicks his tongue when he silent reads and Jake *can't stand it*  and expressed his frustrations through slamming his hand on Bobby's desk and telling him to stfu. You make sure Bobby and Jake sit nowhere near each other and maybe invest in a white noise machine and you can work on figuring out that Jake's dad just left them.\n\nBut not this kid. We could never find a trigger, a scenario outside school, nothing. We had experts come in to look at him and he'd suddenly be the most charming child on the planet, but before they made it to the parking lot he'd be trying to bite us. We begged his parents to try to take him to a therapist our a doctor, but they just kept trying to change his diet.\n\nIf this kid grows into a serial killer I would not be  shocked in the slightest. I occasionally Google his name just to see if anything had happened with him.",

Before he dropped her off, he gave her a respectful comment (nothing inappropriate and without any bad intentions). He was asking if he was the asshole and the answer was no.\n\nThe best part happened in the comments section where somebody asked if he was living in a specific city. He replied a little freaked out with yes. Turn out it was the stranger cousin that he gave the compliment to. After he dropped her of at the restaurant, she went inside to meet her boyfriend. However it wasn't a nice night because he broke up with her. She told her cousin that the compliment that her uber driver gave her gave her some comfort or made her happy or something like that.\n\nThe girl and the uber driver then contacted each other through the cousin.\n\nI don't know what happened afterwards but if somebody knows this post, I will give you a virtual hug if you could link it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: [Here is the link where you can read the original post because it was removed.](https://www.removeddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/f0q59k/aita_for_complimenting_a_girl/)",

What do I do?\u201d  \nits deleted now though but i still have the full post.\n\ni discovered this in another one of these askreddit posts but honestly its too good not to put here. now without further ado, here it is:  \n\n\nHello,\n\nMy girlfriend and me have done dating for 5 month. I thought \"This girl is very good,\" and became of love with her.\n\nYet even so, on this Monday, I comed home and found she as baked all my beans.\n\nYes, all. Oh brother.\n\nIn my cupboard I store several bag of bean, to make soft and to bake on some days, to have a bit of baked bean on my dinner. Or, heck, a lunch too some days.\n\nBut on the Monday I find this girlfriend baked all the beans. I say \"Why do you bake my beans\", and she say something as \"I bakes them good to save time, so I bakes them all now.\"\n\nI am astonished and full of dissmay. I say \"I canfr not eat all the beans\", she say she is froze many of the beans so as we can unfrozen the on a later day and eat some at a time.\n\nBut, if a bean is froze and unfrozed, the very good and very nice flavor of bean is gone far.\n\nA bean is best if baked fresh as a Sunday Pie. Not to be froze and unfroze!\n\nI told my girfriend I am so sad of this, as to my opinion the baking of the beans and to freeze them has ruin all my beans. She say I am \"gone haywire\" by my enragement and sad manners.\n\nBut I hates what she did to my beans.\n\nOn the days before Monday I thought \"Will we marry the girlfriend? Well it might be so.\"\n\nBut now I am so sad she baked them beans. I am consider to end our relations and not be the boyfriend and girlfriend any more. But, is my idea wrong? Could my girlfriend make promise to not bake the beans? I do not know what doing to do and how to feel forgiving on her.",

This was a fine enough goof, but the OP's insistence that this was much more efficient than putting shower gel on one's body made it become a meme.\n\nSo what happens when two memes are popular at the same time? Exactly.\n\n*Someone froze a block of chili and rubbed their body with it*. And achieved the coveted #1 spot. This site is weird like that. \n\n_Sorry no links as I'm on mobile.

Maybe it's genetic, maybe it's our diet, but everyone births giant logs of crap. If anyone has laid a mega-poop, you know that sometimes it won't flush. It lays across the hole in the bottom of the bowl and the vortex of draining water merely gives it a spin as it mocks you.\n\nGrowing up, this was a common enough occurrence that our family had a poop knife. It was an old rusty kitchen knife that hung on a nail in the laundry room, only to be used for that purpose. It was normal to walk through the hallway and have someone call out \"hey, can you get me the poop knife\"?\n\nI thought it was standard kit. You have your plunger, your toilet brush, and your poop knife.\n\nFast forward to 22. It's been a day or two between poops and I'm over at my friend's house. My friend was the local dealer and always had 'guests' over, because you can't buy weed without sitting on your ass and sampling it for an hour. I excuse myself and lay a gigantic turd. I look down and see that it's a sideways one, so I crack the door and call out for my friend. He arrives and I ask him for his poop knife.\n\n\"My what?\"\n\nYour poop knife, I say. I need to use it. Please.\n\n\"Wtf is a poop knife?\"\n\nObviously he has one, but maybe he calls it by a more delicate name. A fecal cleaver? A Dung divider? A guano glaive? I explain what it is I want and why I want it.\n\nHe starts giggling. Then laughing. Then lots of people start laughing. It turns out, the music stopped and everyone heard my pleas through the door. It also turns out that none of them had poop knives, it was just my fucked up family with their fucked up bowels. FML.\n\nI told this to my wife last night, who was amused and horrified at the same time. It turns out that she did not know what a poop knife was and had been using the old rusty knife hanging in the utility closet as a basic utility knife. Thankfully she didn't cook with it, but used it to open Amazon boxes.\n\nShe will be getting her own utility knife now.\n\nEdit: Common question - Why was this not in the bathroom instead of the laundry room? Answer. We only had one poop knife, and the laundry room was central to all three bathrooms. I have no idea why we didn't have three poop knives. All I know is that we didn't. We had the one. Possibly because my father was notoriously cheap about the weirdest things. So yes, we shared our poop knife.",

                            "comment": "I hadn't ever heard this story before and it reminded me of my high school girlfriend's family, which seemed to have similar problem with toilet clogging poops.\n\nI was at her house as I often was, as we've were dating 2-3 years at that point, and I was pretty much a member of her family at that point. So it goes without saying that her family was pretty comfortable we me there, and didn't treat me like a standard guest anymore.\n\nShe had a younger brother named Bobby and he was the standard level of dorky younger brother Othat most are. Her mom, Janet was very chill and cool and rarely got angry. Her Father Jay, was a different story he was mostly calm a lot of the time, but once he passed a threshold, he became unreasonably angry and it took him a little bit to wind back down. You could see it when we watched football games together, where over time as the bad calls stacked up and ultimately damaged the game he would rant very loudly and for a long time about what kind of life the ref had to have lived to eventually decide to become an NFL ref, with the sole mission in life to fuck the NY Giants. The rage he built himself to always started off a pretty serious and little scary, but they went on for so long that after a while they became funny and epic. They even got him a little ref plush doll with detachable limbs and head to throw at the TV, which he used very often.\n\nBesides yelling at NFL refs about the NYG, the only other triggers he had (besides me holding his daughter's hand) was having to unexpectedly work on the house. So cut to one random day where everyone is home and Bobby goes into the bathroom and is in there for long enough for Jay to knock on the door to tell him to hurry up because he has to go too. There was only one bathroom in the house.\n\nSo out comes Bobby and sheepishly announces he thinks he clogged the toilet and couldn't unclog it with the plunger. Jay goes into the bathroom, takes one look at the toilet and just goes off. \n\nIt starts with a criticism of Bobby's diet, and how if maybe he wasn't eating so much junk food and had a bit more fiber, he wouldn't have such a ridiculous turd, and smaller \"more manageable amounts\". Somehow this was tied to Bobby's lack of respect to for the home he was being provided and the roof over his head. The phrase \"negative crap\" both a physical thing, and just a way of spirit and life seems to be at the core of the rant. How Bobby's \"negative crap\" is just the embodiment of all the things Bobby should improve in his life to live better. Bobby had long retreated to his room, which was in the basement, and mostly out of earshot of this, so it was my gf and I, and her mom who were the ones listening to speech, while Jay tried to work the plunger and undo his son's attack on his home.\n\nEventually Jay just can't hold it anymore, loudly shuts the bathroom door and there is peace for a while. The quiet in the house is broken by a two long flushes, back to back. Out comes Jay with a kind of smile on his face and walks into the kitche\n\n \"I unclogged it\" he says to his wife, to which she responds with \"what?\"\n\n\"I unclogged it with my positive crap\". His wife Janet, makes a disgusted face and says \"oh Jay enough with the vulgarness\" This kind of wounds him a little bit, and he launched into a new rant about how his \"positive crap\" is what holds the house together, and how his positive attitude is what keeps the pipes flowing. She gives me a look that says \"I'm sorry for this\" and Jay continues on about what it means to be a man and a responsible adult, sometimes sticking his head towards the steps that leads to the basement so Bobby can hear, and eventually all my gf can do is plead with him \"daddy please stop\" but can't help start laughing to which we all start laughing at it.\n\nAll this could have been avoided if they had a poop knife I guess.",

This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel. He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious. My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face. He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today. It's painful to watch. But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge. In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says \"heeeey. It's OPS. Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five. Thanks.\" And puts the phone down. And then he just sits there. Squinting. Waiting. And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him. After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me. By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face. He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel. I am in awe. He slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour). But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel. \n\ni still think about it sometimes.",

He then for reddit karma turned a not yet released bit of animation into a meme and Disney found out about it and fired him so he ended up having to deliver mail. If anyone remembers that one and can find a link please do.",

He posted a single frame of an unreleased episode and somehow the mouse found it, and was able to trace it back to him. He owned up and hoped for the best, and they blacklisted him. Since the mouse and it\u2019s properties accounted for such a huge amount of his potential clientele he was effectively forced out of the industry. I think he said that he didn\u2019t mind the mailman job because it got him out of the house, but god damn, if ever there was a story about killing the goose that laid the golden eggs...",

            "comment": "I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been. An honest happy period in my life, and a first at that. \n\nI finally stopped pretending that I was okay, that I wasn\u2019t struggling, and my family tore me apart\u2026 I hit an awful rockbottom, and found out that reaching out for help was tougher and scarier than I thought. I had spent years acting like I was fine, because my family only had time for my older brother as he went through a revolving door of hospital visits. I needed to be okay enough for no one to worry, and bad enough to explain why I couldn\u2019t accomplish tasks I felt anyone could\u2019ve done without struggle. And the facade fell apart,  because there was no way to keep it up anymore. They thought I was just making excuses. \n\nSo, I\u2019m on my way to getting assessed. I needed to investigate what my problems were, and I found out I very likely have adult ADHD. I self identified with 9/9 symptoms of depression. For context 5/9 is needed for one to be diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. And the 9th symptom is suicidal thoughts and self harm, something I hadn\u2019t admitted was there. There was evidence of a possible anxiety disorder as well. It feels surreal, looking at my life through this new lens, knowing I shouldn\u2019t expect to not struggle. \n\nMy family rejected my plea for help, initially. My friends didn\u2019t. They told me I was loved, that they had my back no matter what. My family hadn\u2019t seen me struggling because I felt I couldn\u2019t take what little of their lives they had left after my brothers major mental illness had worn us all down. That situation was a pain unto itself, and a trauma I\u2019m still working on. Looking someone you\u2019ve known your entire life in their eyes, and not seeing *them. *A passenger you don\u2019t recognize. But, I allowed myself to become unimportant, and I suffered silently because *I\u2019m the one who was better. *\n\nI\u2019m crying as I write this. I cry almost every day, and I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been, because for the first time in my life it all makes sense. I know why I\u2019ve rejected my own emotions, and I know why I can\u2019t live that way anymore. I have to give myself space, and now my family knows how hard life has been. I\u2019m blessed to come to this realization while they are realizing they need to make changes for themselves.\nWhen they are struggling, I have a support system of my own, filled with wonderful human beings, a lot of them fellow men who are brothers to me. I miss my brother terribly, and the friendship and connection we once had. He is suffering worse than ever. But, his condition is like the rising and setting of the sun, a constant that will not change for as long as we live. I can\u2019t be angry at the sun. Well, that\u2019s a lie. I *know* I can be angry at the sun. But that doesn\u2019t stop its movement, it won\u2019t shine above me for as long as I need it to. A period of night can be a happy time, if I let it be. But, I won\u2019t be happy if I do not give myself permission to be sad. \n\nA teacher who changed my life might be dead, no one knows, he was simply gone one day. I\u2019m putting down my family dog of 16 years next week. My brother has never been more depressed. And I am going to be okay, because my sorrows are valid, the people around me love me, and now they understand me and do not expect me to be the person I pretended to be. Giving room for the pain has also opened up the room joy and fulfilment. I cry, feel what I *need* to feel, and then set down my burdens. \n\nIt gets better, but only when we start being honest with ourselves and the people who love us. Two months ago I wanted to die. Now, I\u2019ve stopped surviving and I\u2019ve started *living*. Love yourselves men, you\u2019re kings, all of you.",

And to top it all off, she is legitimately my best friend and I love making her laugh. Truly we are blessed.\n\nBut.. the intimacy between me and my wife is gone. I know sex isnt everything, but it isnt nothing, ya know? To he clear, I dont miss \"sex\", I miss being wanted. I know if i pressed her, she would allow me to have sex with her, but that isnt what I want. I want her to genuinely want me. \n\nHow can I blame her, though? I see the guy in the mirror. I'm 41 hears old and totally out of shape. I wouldn't fuck me. But how the hell do parents find time to be healthy?!? I get about 2 hours, late at night after the kids go to bed for myself, and this comes at a cost to sleep. \n\nSo.. no real answers, and Im not asking for help or anything.

Is it any good?  What are you reading?\"  Sign up for a cooking class the rec center.  Or a yoga class or a photography class or a glass blowing class or whatever you're interested in.  Find a hobby shop that has a game night and go play board games with people.  The point is put yourself out there where other people are.  It will be uncomfortable.  It will be awkward.  There will be people who will look at you like you're a freak.  You'll also meet someone who will say, \"Yes.  I read that book before.  It's awesome.  You should totally read it.\"",

Love my soon to be wife a lot. Her, myself, and my parents have put in a ton of effort to make sure the wedding is good. \n\nMy 2 grandmother's aren't in the best shape. My mom's mom has been on the decline since February, and in the last 3 weeks they found out she had some type of stage 4 cancer. She's 94 years old, any treatment would kill her. She's in pretty good spirits, I went and saw her 2 weeks ago and had a great conversation with her. She doesn't deserve to suffer, so as long as she isn't in pain or severely uncomfortable, the situation will be what it is. Mentally, she's 95% with it, she's just run out of gas. She's lived a great life, has 10 grandchildren who are all doing great in life, and 28 great-grandchildren. \n\nMy dad's mom is 89 and really can't take care of herself any more, there's for sure some mental issues there, severe anxiety or something. Back in January she finally told him about ulcers that formed on her legs, there was 3 different types of bacteria in the wounds and she was a few days from going septic. My dad spent 5-7 nights a week over there changing her bandages. Then they discovered she almost ran out of money, so my dad got her condo ready to sell and sold within weeks. I spent some time out there helping him get her moved and some light demo work done to prep for the sale. My dad's brother cut ties with her years ago and isn't involved, and my uncle shows up to take her to lunch and doesn't get involved in the messy things, yet she still \"considers him her son\". Her situation was 100% avoidable and cast this dark cloud over our entire family that has not been easy to escape from. \n\nWhen people ask, I say I'm hanging in there.",

Also in South Africa there's a thing called Alcoholics Anonymous where I think a person can phone in and talk to someone. So maybe try find out if there is a similar service where you live.\n\nI think you should try to find out about the service and create a support system(family,friends, therapy group or all of them), mainly for the emotional support. \n\nI'm not sure if you're religious or not but maybe try praying. Praying has given me comfort with my own struggles so hopefully if will help too.\n\nEdit: the praying isn't some ultimate solution it is meant to comfort you and I'm not trying to make you religious.",

When i was around 18 i was in a dark place myself and really got hooked on Hard Drugs for a long time which made me schizophrenic and booked me a 3 year stay in a psych ward. Drugs may help you at the moment but in the long run its only gonna bring you down more because you keep needing more to achieve that same high again. My advice and thats only my advice you are fee to do what you want, but you should tell your therapist what you are battling with in your head. I wish you the best homie and dms always open if you need someone to talk to \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa",

I realized it's probably because of my untreated adhd and other mental health issues. Ive been trying to find a therapist and psychiatrist for medication assistance, while living effectively homeless. The one light at the end of the tunnel in my life, my girlfriend, is currently mad at me because I got angry when she suggested in front of my group of friends that we should go on vacation in the fall. We are both in debt and have had numerous discussions about being better with budgeting so we can be debt free in about a year, and then we can travel for her job and get paid to do it(she's a nurse). I'm pretty sure she is going to break up with me because why would she stay with someone who can't work and doesn't even want to travel or see the world?\n\nAnd also fascism is on the rise, the world is on fire and getting hotter, the reddit app I use and am very addicted to is going away and I really don't see a point in doing much of anything these days because of all of it. My options are die, or get myself medicated enough to ignore everything above and just get going with a shitty life that will likely end screaming and in pain.\n\nSo not very good.",

I'm in the same province as one of the big Canadian wild fires, so I'm glad we got some moisture. \n\nAs I waited for the bus, the geese living by the pond across the street had their babies out grazing and foraging before the heat of the day settled in.

            "comment": "I hate going home most days. At home my father does nothing but lay in bed. He qorks and is depressed but its dragged my mood down significantly. My siater was in an accident with me, i was driving. She is doing the dame and hiding from everything. I go hoke to an empty house full of people. Seems to be a family issue coz spending a week with my brother accross the country didnt help.\n\nWork is my happy place. Even with all th3 shit i need to deal with in a retail setting. I have friends that atleast seem like they want to spend time with me. Im good at my job and i have earned the trust of most of the people working there. \n\u2079\nId rather walk out of the house in the rain at 6am and take 2 taxis to get to work than consider a remote position that would keep me at home.\n\nI dunno. Im coasting. If it all ends tomorrow i would be fine. If it ends when im 80 i would be fine. No motivation left man.\n\nGonna continue the dnd game i was running. Hope it gives me aome purpoae but if not im just gonna keep coasting",

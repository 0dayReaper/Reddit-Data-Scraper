            "comment": "I once met my worst nightmare from high school while taking college night classes. (She was pure evil, trust me.) I felt panic and heartache trying to overtake me as I mentally started to relive the darkest corners of my high school years. Most of the pain was at her hands.\n\nShe started purring to me about her wonderful life - wages, housing, job, marital status - you get the picture. I actually felt sorry for her. I earned more than her doing a job I loved, had a better house and car, and was happy in my marriage. By the time we finished our comparisons, she was the one walking with her head down. \n\nShe avoided me after that.",

They squealed and got all \u201cOmG gIrL!\u201d Told me I \u201clooked SO different,\u201d I was \u201cso PRETTY now\u201d (\ud83d\ude44) before asking if my friend was my boyfriend (he wasn\u2019t).\n\nI looked at them, pretty faces, smirks, same expressions 4 years later\u2026 and laughed.\n\nTold them \u201cWhy are you speaking to me as if we were friends? We were not friends then, we are not friends now. So walk away- I\u2019ve better things to do than waste my time talking to you.\u201d\n\nThey stomped off sputtering about how rude I was, and I just kept smiling.\n\nMy college friend (who had heard the stories about their clique) bought me an ice cream sundae lmao. It tasted like sweet, sweet vengeance. I got out of that town, grew up, and have an amazing life.\n\nThey\u2019re still stuck there like everyone else in our class who peaked in high school and will spend the rest of their lives reliving \u201cthe good old days\u201d in the dive bar downtown",

You see, a punch hurts. But a punch from someone with a roll of quarters in their fist hurts MUCH more. The more you know! Anyway, he wasn\u2019t working that night, so I ended up having a lovely night of drinks with old friends and brand new friends. I didn\u2019t go back again.",

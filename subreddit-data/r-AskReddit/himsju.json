He memorised the equation he needed to ask, say 327 times 8, walked over to Alexa, asked her the equation, walked back to the laptop, walked back to Alexa to ask her again because he'd forgotten the last 2 digits, walk back to the laptop, enter the answer, walk back to Alexa to check it again. \n\nHe had to keep walking backwards and forwards because he knew it was cheating so he'd turned the volume down so I wouldn't hear from the next room. \n\nSo while he thought he was being clever, he was actually taking more time to figure the answer out using the Alexa than it would have taken to do it himself.\n\nPlus of course there's the fact he was working on a laptop that has a calculator, and a Cortana assistant that does the exact same as Alexa, and he knows how to use both the calculator and Cortana but still chose to cheat in the least efficient way possible.",

In the 1st 2 weeks after getting a hang of my responsibilities, writing all the Excel formulas needed, and basically automating 99% of my work, I was chilling.\n\nI went from actually working from 9-5 to maybe 1 hour tops a day. Finding, importing, cleaning, and reporting usually took hours but with all the formulas it took 2 minutes of clicking. I then helped the other cool intern get his shit set up so we could both just chill. We could take 2-hour lunches (paid for by the company) and nobody said anything cause we were just getting so much more done than the other interns. Ofc I helped for special tasks when asked but those were simple 20min tasks building something in Excel.\n\nOverall, was the easiest/stress-less internship of my life.",

He achieved success writting songs for bands like the Archies, possibly most notably \"Sugar, Sugar.\" After his success he coasted for awhile until his record label dropped him for lack of output. At that point he created his own  label and cranked out hits like \"Rock Me Gently.\" When they saw this, the big record labels then bought his label under the assumption that they would then profit off of the songs he wrote and performed.\n\nHe then very shortly stopped writing songs and largely lived off the sale of his label.\n\nWork smarter not harder.",

This usually kept the class quiet for half an hour or so. Seven year-old Carl  was sitting quietly with the correct answer (5050) while the rest of the class was just starting, so the surprised teacher asked him how he came up with the solution. He replied that he added 1 and 100 and got 101. Then he added 2 and 99, and got 101, 3 plus 98 = 101, and so on. He realized there was a pattern of 50 pairs of numbers with each pair adding up to 101. And 50 x 101 = 5050.",

            "comment": "I was once set to test a certain piece of equipment on a ship. The test involved attaching the unit to a reader, then run loads of command line commands. Then, one would have to make a copy of all the text, copy it into word and save it as a (real crappy looking) report. There was HUNDREDS of units, and they needed to be testet several times a year. We did about 20-30 a day. It would take several weeks to finish. \n\nI didn't know coding at the time, but always wanted to learn it.\n\nWithin two months, I had made a program, even with a GUI (to spot faults with ease, instead of having to actually READ the reports). The program could read three units at a time, and would automatically create a smooth pdf report and save it on our server, named with serial number and date.\n\nThe job was now to attach three units, then wait for about 3 minutes, detach and attach new ones. Basically 30 seconds work, 3 minutes break. I could now test all units in a day, though I would typically spread it out over a couple more days.\n\nWhen I left the company, I left the program on the test computer. I got an email from an ex colleague a few months later, saying they were using the program on several ships now. There wasn't any manual for the program, of course, but it was so straight forward that it wasn't needed.",

One of my main tasks was to make calculation about how many people enlisted for a course, how many of them got discounts (unemployeds e.g.), how many men/women/age etc. That was needed to calculate upcoming courses fees etc. That was my only work there and I hated it.\n\nThis was in early 90s, so PCs were a thing in our offices but I had no idea how to write a program or use a database to use this informations. Lucky as I am our center had an interesting policy: when you want to educate yourself, you can attend that class for free. And when it's during the worktime, then this is worktime - as long as my supervisor is ok with that. She was.\n\nSo I spent 3 months \"studying\" database structures, scripting, coding etc. I told my tutor what I wanna do and he helped me to write a script that grabs all necessary informations from the courses-database, copy that into another database and then I went crazy and wrote code that was insane. I implemented \"what if\" scenarios thanks to filters. At the end I was able to do my work, that needed 6hrs a day within 15 minuntes. I mean, before that it took e.g. an hour to have all the necessary informations to have a \"how many unemployed single parent women does it need to make the costs of that course even. I had EVERYTHING back then. Now you want statistics how many single parent disabled foreign women at the age of 80-90 are needed for the next 2 years to keep the ornithology course running? Sure, no problem. Clickety-Click, done.\n\nAfter that, I started the PC in the morning, grabbed all the data, ran my script, was done within 15 mins and then read the book I brought from home. At the end of the day I gave my supervisor several dozens of papers, statistics, predictions etc and said \"That was a lot of work!!\" and went home. My supervisor was superhappy with me because I did so much more now and was super-effective.",

The dude who didn't do anything but maintain the \"completely automatic\" system.\n\nI got a call about two years later that the server I had set up crashed and they couldn't recreate the process. I never returned the call, and guess who went out of business shortly after.\n\nEDIT. This got more attention than I was expecting, so some more info: This was a small construction-related company, so they were hit very hard by the 2008-2009 recession. I really had no hard feelings about being let go **at the time it happened**, mostly because I was already looking for something else, anyway.  But due to the economy at the time, I still ended up unemployed for another six months, and I felt lied to by the owner about his efforts to bring me back, sell one division that would get me a job, etc. One could say I grew more and more bitter about it at time went on. Still, they asked for some help from time to time, and I did go back to do some consulting at a decent hourly rate more than once. It was a year or so after those calls stopped that they were really in the shit. By that time, I was on to a much better job (still there 10 years later, now making literally triple what I made at the construction company). If they could have afforded to pay what I would have demanded, they could have afforded to not have a problem in the first place. The writing was on the wall at that place for a while, so I may have been one of the straws that broke the camel's back, but hardly the first, and probably not the last. Bad management all around killed that business.",

One of my tasks was to update the landing page every day with the date, a little thing about the day (\"Happy International Women's Day\" or \"Today is Nelson Mandela's Birthday\" or whatever) an inspirational quote, and a link to a random article from our archives.\n\nThe person who'd had the task before me was editing the HTML by hand every day. It wasn't a big task, but it was blocked out in my schedule for 8am to 8:30am every morning. Within the first week, I'd built a very simple database and script. It took about 2 hours total, and then for the whole three years I worked there, I had half an hour in the morning to just drink coffee and browse the Internet until the script pushed the update live automatically at 8:30.\n\nThis is one tiny innocuous example among many from my own experience, and I'm certain anyone who knows even basic programming and has worked in an office has a dozen or more similar stories of their own.",

This triggered an internal security audit which was unable to determine how the hacker was getting in. They eventually decided to roll out physical security keys to make the VPN more secure. This had the desired effect and the illicit connections stopped...for around one week. Then they mysteriously started again. Their network team was baffled as to how this apparent hacker had penetrated their more secure setup. So they called in an external auditor to solve the mystery.\n\nIt turned out that one employee had hired someone in China to do his work for him. He had several other jobs at other companies that were similarly outsourced to a much cheaper Chinese worker and was pocketing more than $1m per year in salary above what he paid his remote workers. He had always received exemplary reviews and had even turned down promotions. When they had instituted the physical VPN tokens, the remote employee had been unable to connect while his token was being sent by FedEX.",

Then I got tired of having more than one program open, and not being able to search within &amp; among those order sheets (at least not automatically, or easily), so I'm having our FileMaker guy integrate it into our greater ordering &amp; invoicing system.\n\nI was frustrated at the pointlessness of sorting a giant pile of paper invoices from an unpaid stack to a paid stack every month, so I just use the accounting software to keep track.\n\nI became *so irritated* with having to fill out a multi-page, printed spreadsheet for every single order (sometimes just one item, two pages in [and frequently, there would be those pesky itemized sub orders]) that I condensed the items into \"most used\", put them  all on one easy to read sheet, and encouraged my co-worker to simply write out the more uncommon items at the bottom.\n\nBasically, I hate busy work, and paper invariably leads to busy work. I have tried to reduce the use of paper in our office, but have not been entirely successful. \n\nWe have to have written order forms available (because sometimes the orders are coming in too fast to be able to type it all quickly &amp; correctly), and have to keep some paper records for things like Organic, FDA, and USDA audits - but all in all I'd say my absolute hatred of filing has reduced busywork here by at least half.",

Some workplaces will also make people dust or sweep floors if they finish their work early - heaven forbid you just let them take off early because, you know 9-5!\n\nAnd going home early but keeping the same amount of pay? Definitely not going to happen. I had a boss that wouldn't even let met leave at 4:47 PM because I was scheduled till 5:00.

Why did I do that? Because I like organizing stuff and keep everyone on the same page and delegate to-dos. \n\nGot promoted because of the success of the project. \n\nI asked my boss why he put me in for it since I never done anything like that. He said because I complained in the first week that most of the work has way too wonky structure, no clear guideline and this could be improved heavily if we just take some time into it. And because I hated talking to others if I had questions and I wouldn\u2019t get a clear answer (like: ask 10 people the same question and you get 15 different answers). In the long run this would make us way more efficient and keeps everyone on the same page. \n\nAll because I hated disorganized work.",

They mostly had me practice and do some basic stuff their head designers was to busy to do.\n\nOne was a real estate add. It had a few basic templates, but it was all kinds of scatterbrained. I would spend 5-10 minutes trying to find the right layer for all the pictures, and had to mess with way too much.\n\nSo I made copies of the files, and made one for each template. I labeled everything, made it so the images on top of each other wouldn\u2019t clip into the lower ones like the previous did.. so on.. you could be in and out of the template in 2-3 minutes. Showed my boss the difference, and he had this face of \u201cwell shit..\u201d he said the next day that if I was a graduate he\u2019d hire me, because I was better than the people sending applications in. \n\nIn short I made an overly complicated/unorganized thing the opposite, and my boss was actually sad he couldn\u2019t hire me.",

I smirked to myself, compared the field to the written text, and repeated THAT process instead. I **did** go back and scroll through that first document to ensure I hadn't missed anything due to a goof in the software or anything like that.\n\nnear the end of my second day, I was called into my bosses' office and asked what I'd been doing the past two days. turns out, as of day two, I was churning through five or six times the amount of documents a day compared to people who'd been working there for years. my boss assumed I was just clicking through new documents without doing any work and was very much acting like he had caught me red-handed.\n\nI asked if they reviewed the documents I finished to ensure that I'd done the work. he replied that they hadn't, but, it was obviously impossible to go through that many pages in the time it took me to do it. I told him that I knew for a fact that if he went through any of my work, he'd see everything was fine.\n\nhe pulled one of my finished documents at random, and spent several minutes scrolling through it, shaking his head to himself, staring daggers at the screen. he admitted that this document was fine, but, it would take hours for his assistant manager to review all my work.\n\n\"Can I show you something? Could you please pull up another random document of mine?\"\n\nhe rolled his eyes, but, he did it. I stood up from my chair, came around the desk, and I hit tab. he was looking at the screen like it was witchcraft, I showed him the field matched, and tabbed my way through the rest of the fields, confirming the rest of the numbers as I did. I finished reviewing the whole document with him in less than a minute.\n\nhe asked me if my trainer showed me that. I replied that he hadn't, but, it was a universal keyboard shortcut that I'd been using since the early 90's - this happened in 2013, btw.\n\nhe just looked at me for a bit, and then said he had to talk to his assistant manager about the whole thing, before asking me to go back to work.\n\nlater, I'm heading out at the end of the day when my boss asks me to come over to his office. he fires me for \"not taking the job seriously\" and \"potentially causing delays to taxpayers due to inaccuracies.\" I actually laughed at him after he got done with his spiel.\n\n...and that's the story of how I managed to flummox several state employees with a highly controversial use of the tab button. still blows my mind.",

Here's a summary of his shenanigans:\n\nEdit: repo code is based on the story, not actually from this person\n\n&gt;xxx: OK, so, our build engineer has left for another company. The dude was literally living inside the terminal. You know, that type of a guy who loves Vim, creates diagrams in Dot and writes wiki-posts in Markdown... If something - anything - requires more than 90 seconds of his time, he writes a script to automate that.  \n\n&gt;xxx: So we're sitting here, looking through his, uhm, \"legacy\"  \n\n&gt;xxx: You're gonna love this  \n\n&gt;xxx: [smack-my-bitch-up.sh](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/smack-my-bitch-up.sh) \\- sends a text message \"late at work\" to his wife (apparently). Automatically picks reasons from an array of strings, randomly. Runs inside a cron-job. The job fires if there are active SSH-sessions on the server after 9pm with his login.  \n\n&gt;xxx: [kumar-asshole.sh](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/kumar-asshole.sh) \\- scans the inbox for emails from \"Kumar\" (a DBA at our clients). Looks for keywords like \"help\", \"trouble\", \"sorry\" etc. If keywords are found - the script SSHes into the clients server and rolls back the staging database to the latest backup. Then sends a reply \"no worries mate, be careful next time\".  \n\n&gt;xxx: [hangover.sh](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/hangover.sh) \\- another cron-job that is set to specific dates. Sends automated emails like \"not feeling well/gonna work from home\" etc. Adds a random \"reason\" from another predefined array of strings. Fires if there are no interactive sessions on the server at 8:45am.  \n\n&gt;xxx: (and the oscar goes to) [fucking-coffee.sh](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/fucking-coffee.sh) \\- this one waits exactly 17 seconds (!), then opens a telnet session to our coffee-machine (we had no frikin idea the coffee machine is on the network, runs linux and has a TCP socket up and running) and sends something like sys brew. Turns out this thing starts brewing a mid-sized half-caf latte and waits another 24 (!) seconds before pouring it into a cup. The timing is exactly how long it takes to walk to the machine from the dudes desk.  \n\n&gt;xxx: holy sh\\*t I'm keeping those",

One year for some reason there ended up being an unusually high number of empty boxes being shipped out. So in order to stop that from happening the head of the company hired a couple engineers to develope a system to catch any empty boxes so they didn't get shipped with the boxes that actually had the toothpaste tubes in them.\n\nThe engineers developed a system that if the box weighed below a certain amount the system would stop and a worker would have to go remove the box and start everything up again. The person in charge loved the idea and implemented it immediately. And right from the get go the number of empty boxes shipped dropped to near zero. \n\nThe head of the company wanted to go see the system in action so he goes and visits the plant one day and notices a huge fan right by the assembly line. Very confused as it wasn't hot he asked the plant manager why the fan was there. The plant manager said the workers were tired of stopping what they were doing to remove an empty box so they just hooked up a fan to blow the empty boxes off the scale before the system recognized it was empty and shut everything off.\n\nSo laziness led to a more efficient (and cost effective) plan.",

It took many days to build up enough to break a line so they employed a team to walk the routes and shake the poles to loosen the snow.\n\nOne day they saw a bear shaking the poles and realized that if they could get the bear to do it they wouldn't need to walk the route.\n\nSo they gave one guy a bucket of honey and he'd walk the route painting the sides of the poles with honey to attract the bears. It worked for a few more years But this still takes a lot of time to do.\n\nSo then they had the idea of flying a helicopter along the route with a trained sniper with honey paintballs that he'd shoot the poles with.\n\nOn its maiden flight the helicopter passed the lines and the downdraft blew away all of the snow.\n\nThe flights continue to this day but without the sniper.\n\nTypos and grammer fixed by u/brotherdbad",

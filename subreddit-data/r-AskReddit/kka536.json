However, they're committed to trying to take Earth because at this point, it's too late to have second thoughts and back out. The books switch from human to alien (who call themselves \"the Race\") characters. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere are several books covering multiple decades, covering military, political, cultural, and technological shifts for both aliens and humans. Humans and aliens are written to portray them as neutral, asses, and/or sympathetic, and also highlight how \"alien\" the Race and the humans view each other. The humans call them \"Lizards\" and the aliens call humans \"Big Uglies\", for example.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's basically like a slower moving Independence Day, but the aliens are portrayed with more motive, emotions, and background for how and why they do what they do. Also you get the bonus of timeskips several decades after First Contact.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwar_series\n\nhttps://turtledove.fandom.com/wiki/Worldwar_Franchise \n\nThe author, Harry Turtledove, is known for doing a lot of \"what if\" alternate universes like this.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Turtledove",

I read it more than 10 years ago an remember it being really good.

[youtube link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuCn8ux2gbs) \n\n\n\nParallaxnick on youtube is very good at explaining astronomy.  I haven't watched his Fermi Paradox series yet, but it seems like the right direction  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1-J6zzHW-c&amp;list=PLa0TgREKn12gYAbb3meSdl3nTzMKj8lcU\n\nI like Moth Light Media and PBS Eons on youtube for covering evolution, although I wish they'd get into theoretical stuff like the origins of life and single cell-to-multicellular.  This podcast with Sara Imari covers that well [youtube link](https://youtu.be/hcG5IBHrvYo?t=373)     , [podcast on website link, skip to 6:30](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2020/01/13/79-sara-imari-walker-on-information-and-the-origin-of-life/)\n\n\nMaybe other people have better recommendations?",

                    "comment": "\n&gt;For all we know, life out there could just be reptile-like creatures with no need to be highly intelligent to survive.\n\nThis is basically what I think. There's no particular _reason_ why sapience and intelligence would evolve on any given life-bearing planet, it's just that it happened by chance once on Earth that one species had a viable path forward for intelligence to be its primary survival trait. It's not like it's a guaranteed end result of the evolutionary process.\n\nThere could even be lots of sapient life out there, but they all just aren't interested in developing advanced technology, or can't conceive of doing so, or something. We see this on Earth, animals like Chimpanzees, elephants, or dolphins probably aren't _that_ much less intelligent or self-aware than us, but they don't have anything higher than the most basic level of technology, probably just because their brains aren't wired to do it. Chimpanzees especially, it's been observed that they don't have the capacity to actively teach other chimpanzees or pass on inter-generational knowledge the way that humans do. They're \"smarter\" than us when it comes to their ridiculously good short-term memory, though, so from the perspective of an alien who had equally good short-term memory, they might conclude that chimpanzees are more intelligent than humans. So the problem with finding \"intelligent life\" might have more to do with the fact that our search is very human-centric and is only looking for human-like technology, rather than \"intelligent life\" itself.",

There are no academic standards, so you're basically just paying someone a lot of money to give you a certificate that nobody will respect. They're not cheap either, with most of them being the same price as a state school and certainly more expensive than community college. \n\nIf for whatever reason you're set on the idea of going to an online school, look into the online degree programs offered by regular universities. These are more legitimate as they're being run by actual professors rather than marketing consultants.",

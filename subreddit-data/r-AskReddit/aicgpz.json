So, the Senate leader controls the schedule. In this case it might make sense to allow the house to act as the gatekeeper instead of the Senate leader, but that's not the way Senate policy works, so there would have to be voting reforms based on it which is something that is generally frowned upon and not desirable to normalize. For instance, the Senate during the previous presidency cycle voted to remove the 60 vote threshold to get judges brought to the bench which in turn gave McConnell the excuse he needed to do the same for the SC judges during this presidency.",

Therefore by definition the budget being presented already has an implied majority.  If the budget fails (and in practice it \\*never\\* does - the last time was in 1885!) then this would be treated as confidence vote and so lead to a General Election.  If the government didn't have a majority in practice it would never make it to a budget vote.  \n\n\nThe key difference with the US is that the various players - the President and both houses - are separately elected leading to a near permanent government coalition.  So there's no implied majority before a budget is proposed.",

More importantly, members of Congress are constitutional officers. The President (and life-tenured federal judges) is also a constitutional officer and also cannot be prevented from carrying out their duties except as allowed in the Constitution. As such, they're all constitutionally entitled to pay.\n\nArticle 1, Section 6 of the Constitution:\n\n&gt;The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\n\n27th Amendment:\n\n&gt;No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.\n\nIt also functionally wouldn't do much besides perhaps damage the one or two financially untenable younger members (AOC for example). The shutdown and pay being withheld impact only those employees that *need* that money imminently, which is not the vast majority of Congress and certainly not the President. So that amendment would functionally not be much more than a feel-good effort.",

United States, 696 F.3d 1174 (Fed. Cir. 2012), a group of federal judges sued the government for not giving them a cost-of-living increase, arguing that it violated the constitution's compensation clause.  The court held that the failure to give the suing judges a raise did indeed violate the constitution and remanded to the claims court to determine the amount of back pay owed to the judges.  The Supreme Court denied the government's petition for certiorari, and the Treasury ultimately paid out the ordered back pay.",

There would be *more* government shutdowns and threats of shutdowns, and \"vote with me or lose your paycheck\" would become a viable, common tactic for the wealthier members of Congress.\n\nA better idea would be to just stop voting for idiots. Or, more applicable to this audience: fucking vote.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the gold and silver, and the great discussions! This shutdown is extremely frustrating for everyone, and there are no easy answers. But the more we talk about potential solutions, the more likely we are to find some that work. ",

However, that might be precisely what some people want, and could default to \"if I don't get the changes I want, then we'll just leave things as they are, which I know you dislike more than I do\". It's probably not as bad as shutting down, but it's not exactly good either. I mean, we lived through last year so it can't really be a bad thing.",

            "comment": "This simple argument against it is that newer or less corrupt congressmen would be the only ones to suffer. If you're making 500K selling your soul to a big corporation, than your check for being a part of congress is an after thought. Mean while freshmen senators who realistically spent nearly all of their money on campaigning to get into congress and change a broken system will be the only ones to suffer. \n\nSo this could just help the spread of corruption against high ranking government members. Although why should they be exempt from suffering the way TSA workers or Prison workers do?\n\nI feel that instead of stopping anyone from getting payed, if a budget isn't agreed upon, than we have an emergency 3 months airbag where we pay federal workers for those 3 months and essentially use the previous budget. If those 3 months go by and still no movement is made, then there should be repercussions for congress and the presidency. Something along the lines of an immediate replacement of all leading members of congress and a removal of the current president. This later one is dangerous because there are times that congress would be willing to kill it's self to kick a sitting president out of power, such as republicans during the Obama administration, and I suspect Democrats during the Trump administration.\n\nAdditionally congress should be forced into a minimum of 8 hour work days with the president sitting in on the meeting trying to find a compromise. There should be no vacations, time off, or excuses with the exception of terminal illness. If a member of congress fails to show up, they would effectively be removed from congress, and if the sitting President or Vice President is not there than their power to veto a budget will be removed and it would only take both houses to confirm a budget.",

I think you could phrase it so that you can comply with the 27th Amendment, but there would certainly be court challenges that you would have to spend time and energy fighting.\n\nBeyond that, though, Senators, Representatives, and Presidents aren't really dependent on their salaries. The majority of them are either independently wealthy or make a ton of money off capital gains (ie investments). I don't think holding their salary would change their standard of living in the slightest.",

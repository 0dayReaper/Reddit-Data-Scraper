The show doesn't need a personality. It just needs a comforting figure to fade into the background for the contestants.\n\nThe show exists as a staple of consistency. It's something family friendly that people can look forward to of all ages and watch with the family. It's the lightest fare on television. It's the among the most innocent bits of truly all-ages programming left on the air. The show doesn't need reinvention or celebrity. It just needs a new host.",

I just desperately wanted to reach the point where I no longer cared. But I think that's exactly what kept me in the dark for way longer than I needed to be. A year later I was definitely doing better but I still felt a little beaten up over how much mental torture I had put myself through. I never really got over it until recently when someone else caught my eye, go figure. From that moment it was like all the bad feelings disappeared, and now I know what indifference is. Obsession definitely does not lead to that. Wish I realised that sooner.",

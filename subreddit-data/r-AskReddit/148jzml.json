It can't account for every possible deviance in formatting that some applicants submit, so the manual input is there to either capture what was missed, or give the opportunity to correct any information that was parsed incorrectly.\n\nThis is also assuming their application flow even has a resume parser. If they don't, and they still collect resumes as well as manually inputted data, it's to capture data entered by the applicant to store in their ATS for candidate management. Your resume is also stored so they have a copy in their database for reference/interviews/etc.\n\nThey're not doing to make the application process harder, most of the times they don't know better because their systems lacked the proper resources to implement correctly years before they even started their role as a recruiter. Garbage in, garbage out etc.",

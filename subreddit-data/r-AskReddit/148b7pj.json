He spent a lot of time mad about being fired from SNL,  spent a decade doing the same stoner persona in his act and people got bored with it.  His time doing a show on sirius was literally him playing the same 80's and early 90s rock over and over.. much like his stoner act.  Now he comes off as a self identified victim of society.  You know that statement about how if everyone you meet is an asshole, you are probably the asshole?   Jim Bruer is likely an asshole.",

I remember thinking that racist people think blacks are gross and that hurts you, but you think gays are gross but you laugh about it. Guess the moral is people shouldn\u2019t take the musings of a weed comic too serious.",

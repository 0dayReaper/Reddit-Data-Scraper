In that same episode he talked about the difficulties blacks encounter. I remember thinking that racist people think blacks are gross and that hurts you, but you think gays are gross but you laugh about it. Guess the moral is people shouldn\u2019t take the musings of a weed comic too serious.",

His whole thing was being about \"raza\" helping his people and he does the exact opposite.  Majority of the chicano community especially doesn't like him either.",

I grew up in London, and was regularly told to go back to Ireland, my family were thick terrorists, etc. So to see something like Father Ted show off Irish humour, and have it so we'll received was a great moment",

            "comment": "I worked at a pretty high end Mediterranean Bistro, my second Valentine's there it was probably the busiest night I've ever worked as a server. We had reservations that booked basically the entire restaurant including the bar and patio from 4 P.M to 11:00 P.M. No walk-ins were to be seated unless a reservation was cancelled, or someone with a reservation didn't show up.\n\nMost of the customers were pretty understanding and either waited or simply left. One dude however kept pushing and pushing asking every 10 minutes how much longer until he is seated, constantly saying how he is a regular customer; and how his date is going to be there at 7 (he got there at 6). We insisted that once a table was available, and all the customers before him we're seated, he would get a table, but because the amount of reservations we couldn't guarantee he would even get a table at all. At about 6:50 the guy loses it, fast-walks up to the hostess stand where the reservation book is, grabs the reservation book and practically runs out the front door.\n\nNow everything is going to complete shit because the only copy of the reservations for the night that is barely half over is gone. Two of the owners ran outside to follow the guy and try and get the book back, but by the time they got out he had already left the parking lot. Even better is, two hours later, chaos is still running rampant and the dude shows back up saying he has a reservation for two. Three of the five of the owners (all brothers) escorted the dude and his date out to the parking lot and banned him from the restaurant permanently. They even took a picture of him and posted it in the window saying \"Do Not Serve This Man\"\n\nTL;DR \nSalty dude without reservation steals reservation book and then tries to come back later\n\nEDIT: If anyone wants to use this for a sitcom feel free; just let me reprise my role as the waiter and we can call it even.",

Woman starts sobbing and asks us to call the coos which we do immediately. Turns out this girl\u2019s boyfriend just beat the shit out of her during a fight, and from what I could tell this probably wasn\u2019t the first time. \n\nSo after the cops show up and haul the dude off, my manager offers her a different room on comp as we need to leave the guy\u2019s stuff where it is for him to pick up the next day. She accepts, and I go up with the woman to help her collect her stuff and move to the new room. There were a bunch of bottles of alcohol in the room, and she donated them to the front desk staff. I got a bottle of Hypnotiq, and some vodka. Manager got a bottle of Patron.\n\nCherry on top of everything, the dude\u2019s wife called later that night saying someone had stolen his card as he was out of town on a business trip. Never one to defend an abuser, I told her where she could find her husband. Fun times.",

She was dressed to the nines and the grandson was in a nice button up and dress slacks. As they got seated at their table the grandson placed a framed photo of what my friend assumed was the boys grandfather and husband of the older women. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\nFound out it would have been their 70th wedding anniversary but he had passed suddenly but peacefully a few months back. The grandfather had always wanted to take her to a nice restaurant but never had the time or money to do it. So the grandson saved up his pay from the last couple of months and even got some donations from other relatives and took her to the restaurant. They ate dinner remembering all the good times with the man. They had my friend to take a picture and she did. They tipped my friend very well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\nBy happenstance my friend ran into the young man some weeks later to find out the grandmother passed away a few days after that night, peacefully in her sleep holding a photo of her beloved husband. He was so happy he could make that night special to her. Said it was the only day he saw her smile since his grandfather passed away. He got the picture they took at the restaurant printed in wallet sized and carried it around with him in his wallet.  \n\nedit: Fixed some spelling and added more details after speaking with my friend again. I am not a great writer so this might diminish the story, I tried though. Thank you for the award! And I posted this to bring something a little different to the thread other than cheating spouses. It's sad because the lady lost her soulmate of 70 something years, before Valentines day, which also would have been their wedding anniversary.",

            "comment": "16 years in hospitality gives you some good stories.\n\nThe most awkward:\n\nMy first job as a waitress a guy wanted to propose to his girlfriend. He came in 2 months before to book and had everything figured out. He planned to pop the question during dessert. We had champagne, balloons and sparklers prepped for the big moment. The time comes, he drops to one knee gives a speech about his love for her. He asks, she says no, puts the ring in her bag, finishes her dessert and leaves. Quite possibly the most awkward thing I have had to witness (alongside around 200 other people.) The manager gave him everything for free he felt that bad for him. Cringed inside every time I saw him after that.\n\nThe most fucked up:\n\nI was working as a duty manager and one of the tills kept dropping off the network. As I was trying to fix it I could clearly hear the conversation of the table by the waiters station. It started out sweet enough with her excitedly telling him she was pregnant. He went quiet and didn't say anything for a bit and then asked her what the plan was. She said she was keeping the baby. He said he didn't want kids and had told her this. She got upset and said she thought he'd be happy and change his mind when he found out. (By this point I've fixed the till, but am unable to step away from this car crash.) Turns out she stopped taking the pill without telling him thinking she could turn him around. He said he knew she could be a little nuts sometimes but this was next level. He told her it was over and she could send someone to collect her things as he wanted nothing more to do with her. He called me over to pay the bill and just left. The guy never even shouted, he just calmly went fuck this and noped out of there. I couldn't even look her in the eye, just left her to leave in her own time.\n\nThe funniest:\n\nManaging hotel room service where there was a valentines package that included getting each course of the special menu delivered to your room. More than a few couples thought it was a good idea to call for the next course and then start having sex. Having to help with deliveries as reception fucked up the bookings; I had the 'privilege' of people answering the door naked, seeing sex toys strewn around and one where the other members of the threesome were carrying on in the background. After complaints of similar instances from my team I had to take action. I ended up having to call the offending guests and tell them if they could not respect my team by answering the door in at least a closed dressing gown they could come down and collect the rest of their meal from the restaurant. \nBonus from the same night: had to call an ambulance for a woman with a dislocated shoulder. The guy admitted that they were trying to recreate a bukkake type scene in the shower using conditioner as the 'cum.' He slipped in the conditioner and fell on her.",

            "comment": "I was the manager of a wings-and-pizza place with a full bar - definitely not the kind of place you'd take someone for a \"romantic\" Valentine's Day dinner, but it was still busy because some people aren't very tactful.\n\nWe had a guy who had called ahead and asked if we could put a ring in a dessert for him and of course, we obliged. He dropped the ring off the day ahead and I put it in the safe in our office to keep it secure.\n\nFast forward to Valentine's Day. The couple shows up, and they're so obviously in love that she didn't seem to notice or care about the fact that he had brought her to a middle-of-the road place with a sports-bar atmosphere on the most romantic day of the year. They ordered champagne (well, the local winery's best sparkling white), entrees, and it was almost time for dessert. I had used my Chef skills to whip up a special chocolate strawberry tart that wasn't on the menu, just for this occasion (because why not try to make their night at least a *little* fancy?)\n\nI went to the safe to get the ring, and... ***It wasn't there.*** I was freaking out big time. I asked everyone there if they knew what the fuck had happened to it. My assistant manager on-site had no idea, so I called my other assistant (who also had the safe code) and they didn't know, either. Finally, my bar manager mentioned that one of the owners had been in earlier, and spent a little time in the office. So, at my wit's end, I called the owner.\n\nIt turns out that he had seen the ring in the safe, and thought it was something a customer had left behind. Figuring that he had come into an extremely lucky situation, he decided (like the scumbag he was) that he'd take it for himself and save money on a gift for his wife on Valentine's.\n\nSo, I asked the server and bar manager to help stall the couple. The server told them that we were going to do something special for their big date, and to hold tight. \n\nI ran out, hopped in my car, and rushed to get the ring from the owner's house (because he was - as I had mentioned - a scumbag, and didn't want to be bothered with bringing the ring to the restaurant himself). \n\nThe bar manager went over to the table, and did some complicated, table-side cocktail mix that had a bunch of flair bartending tricks and ended with a flaming shot that, once dropped into the rest, made it smoke (I was really disappointed when I heard about all of this because I would have loved to see it instead of breaking a ton of traffic laws on my quest to get the ring).\n\nFinally, I rushed back in after about 15 minutes of being on the brink of a heart attack, placed the ring on the dessert, and had their server take it out. At that point, just about the entire staff was watching the table, and when we saw the look on her face, my heart finally started beating again.\n\nShe said \"Yes.\" And, I started looking for someone else to work for the very next day.\n\n\n***Edit: Thanks for the awards, everyone!***",

            "comment": "I was working for a higher end chain steakhouse in the North West corner of greater Los Angeles (in the valley). Valentines is obviously one of the top 5 busiest days of the year for us, we did about 500 covers between 5 and 10 PM. It\u2019s also a restaurant with a very open concept floor plan. Booths along the 4 walls of the restaurant and an array of tables in the middle with no partitions or anything between them.   A younger couple (maybe mid 20\u2019s) dressed to the nines came in shortly after we opened and were seated in a table basically in the dead center of the dining room. They were very friendly and pleasant and I could tell that for them, dining at our restaurant was a really special treat so I did everything in my power to make it special for them. When they\u2019re done, probably around 7, I brought their check which was around $300. When I came back to pick it up the guy had a super embarrassed look on his face and he said he thinks he left his wallet in the car and the woman, who is embarrassed for him, doesn\u2019t have anything with her because her dress had no pockets and she didn\u2019t bring a purse. So he goes out and 5 minutes later comes back in looking pale as a ghost. He has left his wallet at home and asks if he can call back later with payment info. My GM won\u2019t let this fly because there\u2019s no collateral of any sort he can leave, so the guy has to drive home TO BURBANK to get his wallet while the woman waits, with her hair done and her red lipstick and her pretty dress, In The middle of the dining room on Valentine\u2019s Day. Now, on the best day with no traffic (never happens) it\u2019s at least 40 minutes each way from our restaurant to Burbank. She was there for almost 2 hours waiting for this guy. We were all so embarrassed for her that the staff kept discreetly slipping her drinks and little amuse bouche bites from the kitchen. It was one of the most awkward things I\u2019ve ever seen in a restaurant.   When he finally got back he was super apologetic to us and to her, he paid the check and tipped like 30% and they left. It was pretty obvious it was an honest mistake but I still think about that couple from time to time and wonder how things worked out for them. \n\n\nPosting this from my phone so apologies for any typos or formatting problems",

He was a quiet, unassuming older man, and there was an impressive amount of effort put forward in keeping his identity a secret. \n\nFor one, he never ate alone. He would invite coworkers (mostly on the editing side so they wouldn't be recognized) and very occasionally his friends to go with, so he was never with the same group of people. He would also ask everyone to order something different so he could try multiple dishes without coming back too often and raising suspicion. He would hit each restaurant several times, at different times of day and different days of the week, before making his review.\n\nHe would also never be the one who paid for the meal. Instead, he would have someone who came with pay for it, and then the paper would compensate them once presented with the check. There were no photos of him on the company website or anywhere in the system, and I think I only saw him actually come into the office once or twice to chat with his editor. He also made a point to have a wide variety of clothing styles to wear out, but nothing that made him stand out.\n\nI always thought it was over the top until his editor got a phone call from an extremely angry restaurant owner (that had received a bad review). He was demanding to know when the critic had come (in order to check the security cameras and figure out who it was) and also demanding a re-do, where they could give the critic a \"VIP experience.\"\n\nI get it now.",

As his girlfriend was alone (and absolutely wasted) at the bar, a random woman approached and revealed that she recently matched with the woman\u2019s boyfriend on Tinder and had hooked up a week earlier. The drunk girlfriend refused to believe this story, so the woman showed her his Tinder profile and their conversation. The boyfriend returned to a drunk, sobbing and screaming girlfriend. \n\nI felt like I was watching a reality tv show, it was incredible. The poor girl was basically carried out of the bar by her boyfriend of 3 years whom she just discovered has been cheating on her for who knows how long. It was the most dramatic moment I have ever experienced and it was absolutely none of my business.\n\nEDIT: I was a bar-back at the time and this couple sat directly in front of the place I spend most of my time, the glass washing station.\n\nEDIT 2: For those wondering how the woman knew the couple was in a long-term relationship. I really don\u2019t know. My guess is she figured it out the same way I did, based on listening, body language and the fact that this woman was overly touchy and liberal with cheek kisses and such. It was fairly obvious. Regardless, she approached out of concern and curiosity and she succeeded in outing the guy which resulted in a very upsetting scene.",

He said he wanted to drop them off for my coworker so I let her know he was there but understandably she was running around so it took a bit. While waiting, a bunch of folks waiting for tables complimented him on how sweet he was to do that for his girlfriend and how jealous they were. It was kind of cute.\n\nWhen my coworker finally was able to come up front there was a lot of \"awww\" and such. Again, we were slammed so she ran back after taking the items and it was back to work for all of us. When it died down, I asked her how long she was dating her boyfriend for and she replied. \"He's not my boyfriend. He was the salesman where I just bought my car and I think he got my workplace from the paperwork.\" That was pretty fucking disturbing.",

Young woman was all decked out in a spangly, light blue satin cocktail gown, he was in a suit and tie. They wanted to sit at the grill for the show but still ordered a ton of sushi and drinks so their section of table was extremely full of dishes. I'm talking multiple mixed drinks and waters for both of them, soup and salad bowls for both of them, appetizer plates, sushi plates, soy sauce trays, and their entree plates. The hibachi seats 12 and it's basically a bar ledge around the grill for a table, and we were slammed so there was no extra room. I barely managed to talk them into letting me take the empty dishes as they finished with them, but it hardly helped. The chef starts his show and dude is super into it, demanding to be included. So the chef flicks a shrimp at him. In his effort to show off and catch it in his mouth, he manages to miss it completely and crashes into the table sending food, drinks, and a full bottle of soy sauce on a plate right into his date's pale blue satin covered lap and everywhere else. It was a complete shit show. She was screaming and crying, the other couples that had their meals ruined were all upset, he's blaming me(?!) The bus boys and I were just trying to clean up and salvage what we could of the service... it was awful.",

When they were dropped at the table, they immediately asked for to-go boxes because they told their babysitter they\u2019d be home by a certain time. I overheard the wife say \u201cwell I guess this is why we don\u2019t celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d. The worst part was that they weren\u2019t angry, just... very sad. \n\nMy personal feelings about dining out on Valentine\u2019s Day aside, I felt so horrible that this couple clearly had put in an effort to have a nice night with each other only to have it go that way. (We comp\u2019d their meals, btw).\n\n\nEDIT to clear up some timing issues. I should\u2019ve added more context to this the first time but wanted to keep it simple. They made a reservation but unfortunately got seated about 10 minutes late, they ordered a round of drinks while looking over the menu, then a salad course, and THEN entrees. So at the point their entrees arrived they had already been in the restaurant for close to an hour and a half.",

Some of the times, the other person would give a look that pretty much confirmed that they both had very different interpretations of what was going on.\n\nThere's an episode of 30 Rock where they mention that \"going to IKEA\" is a big stress test in relationships.  That has nothing on going to a restaurant on the busiest days of the year, particularly Mother's Day, and Valentine's (especially when it's on a weekend).  I'd say 99% of the \"disasters\" I've seen have just been normal run of the mill issues where couples realize they have different levels of patience, and one person undoubtedly gets aggravated with the packed restaurant, and their time is ruined.",

The woman was decked out in a super nice dress and faux fur coat that was actually very realistic. Well, she was sat and served her frozen drink. She goes to lift the glass to her mouth, and inexplicably, the bottom of the cup simply breaks and the drink is spilled ALL OVER her dress and nice coat.

The guy (20 ish) says he's waiting for someone, so he's gonna wait to order a full meal, but as waiters we are taught to insist a little more and sell something. So the guy finally orders the cheapest item on the menu (a small carne asada taco, just one). A few hours went by, the dude's date still hadn't arrived, and every 20 or so minutes he would order another one of those small tacos. Eventually the owner of the place, who is a really cool dude and has been a friend of my family for years, tells the waiters \"look at this poor sucker, if the girl never arrives, I'll pay for everything he has ordered myself\"\n\nSo another hour and a half goes by and this dude finally gives up and asks for the check. He looked pretty sad so as a waiter of his age, my cousin told him everything he consumed was on the house. He smiled and left good tips anyway.\n\n\n\nStay strong guys (or gals) if she/he has you waiting that long, she/he's probably not worth it anyways.",

            "comment": "My first day of work on the floor at a country club was the weekend after Valentine\u2019s Day. There was a lot of buzz in the back about this adorable family, where every year the mom brought the son out to a nice dinner at the club and the father brought the daughter to the men\u2019s section for a dinner (which shows how much pull the guy had, since women weren\u2019t allowed in that part of the club). It was their Valentine\u2019s Day tradition. The kids are both ~14 or 15. \n\nI\u2019d also been filled in on the gossip that the waitress I replaced had left to have a baby. She was really young and there was blanket disapproval from the staff and a lot of the members. \n\nI\u2019m serving the mom and son in the more upscale dining room, but getting drinks from the bar where the dad and daughter are, so I\u2019m around both groups. \n\nI\u2019m bringing a bottle of wine to the mom when a woman walks in with a baby in a carrier and starts handing personalized golf balls out to people as a birth announcement sort of thing. She hands one to the mom at the table and one to the son and walks off when the mom knocked her wine glass to the floor and starts whisper-shouting at the son. \n\nPeople are congratulating the new mom, and pretending to be friendly, and then each table seems to go perfectly quiet one after another. \n\nI go to the bar to get a new wine glass and see a man duck over to the dad\u2019s table and say something to him. The man gets up without saying a word, (even to his daughter) and dashes into the men\u2019s locker room, leaving her sitting at the table. \n\nThe whole room goes quiet, but nobody intervenes as the old waitress goes over to the table, hands the girl a golf ball, says a few words I can\u2019t hear then walks out of the club. The girl starts sobbing. \n\nEventually, the mom seems to have remembered the daughter, because the brother comes and leads her out, and they all leave together. \n\nWhen I was clearing the table, I read the golf ball, which says:\n\nWaitress +Member(dad) present\n\nBaby first name and member\u2019s last name\n\nAnd the date.",

            "comment": "I was a waitress many moons ago, and two couples spring to mind. The first were an older couple who were dressed nicely. They were polite and cordial to me, but not overly enthusiastic or friendly. They were at the table for a little over an hour and a half, and we didn\u2019t see them say one word to each other during that time. Every time I went over to their table, the atmosphere felt like I\u2019d walked straight into an argument, but they weren\u2019t speaking, or looking at each other or anything. It very quickly became awkward as fuck. \n\nThe second couple was meant to be having a proposal dinner. The guy had rung to book a table, and had let us know he was going to propose during dessert. He\u2019d given the ring to kitchen staff so we could bring it out with a cake, and he\u2019d got some balloons and streamers too. Anyway, he walks in a couple of steps behind his partner - everyone has big grins for them both - but he grits his teeth and shakes his head, surreptitiously dragging his finger across his throat pantomime style. Great. Oh, and lucky me, they\u2019re seated in my section. It\u2019s obvious she was bloody furious with him about something; she spends the first half of the meal seething quietly, and the second having a constant pop at him. While she was in the loo, the manager made me double check he didn\u2019t want us to bring the ring out or anything. \u201cFuck, no!\u201d was his response. I felt really bad for him, she really was mean!",

I agree to take it while all the other servers are complaining about the reservation only being for one. Anyway.

She nonchalantly gives her name, it's on the reservation list, and so the hostess just...leads her to her table... I walked up to them, being super professional (I was so stoned it wasn't really phasing me) and this woman just orders like 200$ worth of random apps, entrees, and a bottle of higher-end merlot. Of course there were stares, of course others tables inquired and/or complained, but he was such a well behaved \"service dog\" and i never mentioned it or asked questions or stared, and I shit you not that lady tipped me 100% in cash with a twinkle in her eye as she left. 10/10 would wait on them again.

Well you can imagine since it\u2019s busy and Valentine\u2019s Day we didn\u2019t have those, so he basically waited an extra hour to make sure he was seated in the back corner. \n\nIt\u2019s my section, I take their drink order and take care of them though the husband was gone when I returned and I didn\u2019t see him go to the bathroom.\n\nThinking nothing of it I go to the bar to get the drink and see ALL of my coworkers huddled around the monitor above the bar along with everyone else in there. Sure enough I found the husband as he was underneath the table going down on his wife. \n\nOnly problem was the camera above their table had a clear view because it was situated in the corner. \n\nSo now the entire hotel lobby can see as it cycles between us in the bar laughing, people checking in and our romantic couple dining on each other. \n\nMore and more people start to notice and the bar fills up. This includes back of the house staff like dishwashers and the line cooks. Eventually it also brings out my manager who runs over to their table, tells them what happened and they both run out mortified. \n\nBut before they do the husband tries to stand up too quickly and flips the table, ruining all the plates while also exposing that his fly was down and his dick is out. \n\nHe\u2019s yelling at my manager, the hotel manager (who came up when he saw it in the lobby) and security unzipped as he\u2019s escorted out. \n\nSo yes disaster for them but man they made a lot of people laugh that night",

About 10 minutes after them sitting down, I notice that they don\u2019t have drinks yet, not even waters. We were backed up but they at least should\u2019ve had water. I checked in with their server and he said he was totally backed up, so I offered to get their drink orders. I took them, put them in, and ran them for the server. By this point they should\u2019ve been on their second course (salad), but hadn\u2019t even had their cheese yet (first course), so I check in with their server again and end up offering to take the table because they\u2019re so behind. They say sure and thank me. The table finishes drinks and dinner and give me a huge verbal tip, even asking me to get my manager so they can tell him how well I did. I was bracing for a 0%-10% tip... the one dude who paid left me a 400% tip ($1,000.00).",

It was time to bring out their ice-cream cake and as I was bringing it out on a tray one handed, I suddenly tripped and the cake was sliding forward. Apparently my body was already prepared to save this cake from imminent destruction and my free hand caught the cake, by the top. So it was sandwiched between my hands. I was absolutely mortified and nearly In tears. The party told me it was okay, the cake was saved and they just cut the top off. But this event still causes me to lay awake at night. \n\nHope this made you laugh because I haven\u2019t told a soul about this haha\n\nEdit: First, THANK YOU to everyone for the rewards. Came back to my phone and was overwhelmed!. Second, to everyone commenting how you\u2019ve done something similar, thank you for sharing your great stories! I am CRYING laughing at them and Third, because I forgot to clarify, this happened over ten years ago. Yes it haunts me til this day and I believe it will forever.",

I used to work at a small southeastern franchise restaurant, it wasn\u2019t anything you could mistake for upscale. We had someone call in and ask if we could fry the ring he was planning to propose with in a hush puppy. Extremely weird request, but we said sure. \n\nThey come in to eat with their families, she gets her order of hush puppies, doesn\u2019t choke on the ring and seems excited enough. Stayed at the table for about two hours total and chatted. \n\nThey dined and dashed.\n\nEdit: Had no idea there would be a ton of confusion over what a hush puppy was. In America (or at least the south) a hush puppy is a fried ball of corn meal. I promise it tastes better than what it sounds like.\n\nAlso, for all those asking, it was a place called the Shrimp Basket. It\u2019s a pretty small franchise. Sorry to break the hearts of all those that were guessing Waffle House or Captain D\u2019s.",

            "comment": "I am a bartender but happened to be the one on the date for this particular disaster. \n\nSo anyone in the service industry knows, you generally just do not make plans on certain holidays because you will have to work, no matter what. I had not had a date on Valentine's in probably 7 years, so when my boss gave me the day off I was surprised and posted something dumb on insta about it. I got a DM from a girl I knew but not very well, asking me out for Valentines and she was way cute so I figured why the fuck not.\n\nThings went so wrong, so quickly. We get to the restaurant, grab a drink in the bar while we wait on our table, took a shot to get the social lubricant flowing since we dont really know each other very well. I pay our bar tab, and we move to the table.\n\nTo set the scene a bit, this place is a really nice steakhouse and they have these dark red, diamond pattern booths that are fluffy, with buttons at each point of the pattern. Hard to explain but it looked something like this:\n https://centralseating.com/classic-diamond-button-back-dining-booth-with-side-walls-and-curved-top-b1043.html\n\nThe moment we sit down, my date lets out a blood curdling scream like she had just been stabbed. She grabs her arm and her hand comes away covered in blood, and she looks so confused and I have no idea what the fuck just happened. I look around thinking someone just stabbed her but everyone around us is seated just staring over at us. I move over to her side of the booth and grab the napkins off the table to find where she is cut. The entire back of her upper arm is sliced from elbow to shoulder. One of the buttons had broken off of the wall and the snapped metal fastener was exposed so when she sat down her arm ran all the way down along it. \n\nShe is panicking, I am trying to stop the bleeding, while the people around us figure out what is going on and call 911 for us. The manager comes over and is immediately a defensive asshole until he sees that it was his booth that did the damage. The paramedics show up, I get the owners info from the manager, and we spend the night in the ER where she needed something like 80 stitches. \n\nWe both are exhausted at this point, when a guy walks in with flowers, champagne and a bag of takeout food from the restaurant we had left. It was the owner of the restaurant coming to make sure we could have the Valentines meal we had missed out on. Sure it was probably because he was afraid to get sued but it was still really welcomed after how shitty the night had become, so quickly. \n\nShe and I ended up dating for almost 3 years and became good friends with the owner. Such good friends she ended up banging him and that was the last I heard from either of them. Woo, Valentines. I have stuck to working those nights ever since.\n\nThe end.\n\nEdit: I would like to sincerely thank the people going through my comment history and messaging me things like \"maybe if you didn't play so many video games like a manchild then you wouldn't get cucked.\" You guys are making my fucking night and it is hilarious. How dare people enjoy things!\n\nAlso thanks u/pmjm for throwing the chair pic on imgur since we killed the site. Link : https://i.imgur.com/Fn0KXIm.gif",

One of the things I sincerely wish I had discovered earlier was that college doesn't guarantee that path. Took me four tries for a proper degree and another try at a tech school to discover that what makes me happy is farming. Like, literally I was gifted a dozen chickens and was like \"this.\" The simple life. Digging in the dirt and raising animals and it's hard and so far I still struggle with the beer money but I'm happy and I love my damn birds so much. Just wish I would have found this before I took out $10,000 in student loans, which I know is a small amount by comparison but still hangs over my head.",

Sometimes they're not even dead...\n\nIt's still worth it though.\n\nEdit: thank you so much fellow beekeepers!!! I didn't have time to answer a lot of the questions and in looking through the questions, I saw a wonderful, beautiful community bringing awareness and knowledge.\n\nAlso, obligatory thank you for the gold. I'm glad my plight with bees has garnered so much attention and I really appreciate the insightful knowledge that is being shared here!",

Were it so easy!\n\nNowadays, buyers want to see photos of a real woman in the exact pair they'll be buying, or proof in the form of being Pantytrust certified. They'll want extras or special requests for their order (plenty of fetishes to go around), and the vast majority of them will drop off the face of the earth when it comes time to actually pay. You'll have to sift through hundreds of responses to your ad, knowing most of them will be time-wasters just trying to get a little dirty talk or some photos. \n\nMy advice? Don't bother. Leave it to the camgirls who make some side cash off selling their panties, because there's always going to be someone willing to go a step further than you, and they will be the one to make the sale.",

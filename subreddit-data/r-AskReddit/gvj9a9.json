The police were right next to the protesters and the two parties were talking and working with each other about what needs to be done so that everyone involved can go home safely after. It was very civil and honestly uplifting to see black protesters working with white police officers in this political climate, and in a way that makes sure no one gets hurt, innocent people don't lose homes or business.\n\nAnother protester got up and said that he talked to the neighborhood association asking permission to use certain streets and how they need to be respectful of the property because destroying it isn't going to help anyone.\n\nBUT THEN!! some stupid little white kid got up, and I quote, \"they want us to be peaceful... we need to fuck everything up to get our point across!\" He was met with boos and blank stairs.\n\nThe whole stream was a great example on how the peaceful people in the crowd protesting are the ones who want real change and the rioters dont care about the cause, they just want to watch this country burn. Literally and metaphorically.",

Last night, protesters in a nearby city were repeatedly tear-gassed over minor vandalism (graffiti and such). \n\nI\u2019m not a big \u201ccivic pride\u201d person, but I was proud of my city tonight. The protest was peaceful, even with a couple thousand people there (it\u2019s not a big city). The police actually joined in instead of attacking anyone. The cops knelt with us for 8 minutes. The chief of police gave a short speech about how they were there in solidarity and want to keep an open dialogue with the people of the community. When I thanked a group of officers for not letting our community become part of the problem, one of them told me, \u201cWe\u2019re pissed off about this too.\u201d \n\nIt was a nice reminder that even though our country seems pretty fucked right now, there are good people on each side, legitimately fighting for change.",

            "comment": "I want to start by saying that when I say Black Lives Matter- there is an implied \u201ctoo\u201d at the end. I am NOT saying my life matters more, or your life matters less. Just that mine is equally important and not viewed as such by unfortunately, many people. \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d is disrespectful because it negates the purposeful attention we are trying to draw to black injustice specifically. I need you to please understand that racism is not the racism they taught us in school anymore.\n\nModern racism is giving black people higher interest rates or bad loans (which a bank was sued millions for doing in 2017!). It\u2019s relators purposely not showing black people houses in nicer areas. It\u2019s companies only hiring 1-5 black people for their quota and not for their merit, which is ironically racist towards whites who potentially deserved it more- spurring more division. It\u2019s colleges only accepting black people to make themselves look good on paper instead of actually valuing that students strengths &amp; potential. It\u2019s enforcing laws in school that don\u2019t allow black people to wear their natural hair because it is \u201cunprofessional\u201d and a \u201cdistraction\u201d to other students. It\u2019s makeup companies only having 1-3 dark foundation shades because we are a \u201cdemographic\u201d without money &amp; thus not worth pursuing- and then suddenly coming out with more shades once they see how successful Rihanna was when she acknowledged us. It\u2019s crooked police purposely going into low income areas, scanning license plates, and purposely ticketing people they know cannot afford it, so that they will go to jail for outstanding tickets and become a part of the for-profit prison pipeline. It\u2019s fashion companies &amp; movies using damaging stereotypes of black people instead of showing how diverse and beautiful our people are, thus instilling an untrue idea of what \u201cblack people\u201d are to others across the world (imagine you\u2019re from a place with no black people- if all the movies &amp; shows portray us a certain way, you\u2019ll assume that must be true).\n\nWhen  I first started at my old place of employment, a very nice tech company, I had a black  janitor stop me one morning as I was heading up to the office, tears in  his eyes. He gripped my shoulder; his hands frail, wrinkled- and told me  how proud of me he was. How happy he was that a little black girl was  working at \u201cone of them tech companies\u201d. I hugged him &amp; told him  thank you. When I tell you I ran to the bathroom and bawled my eyes out.  I was so grateful, but that is a heavy burden to carry- not only was I  working for me, I was working for him, for all my ancestors who didn\u2019t  have a chance. And when I was let go 2 months ago, it hit hard because it felt like  not only did I fail me, I failed them. I realize it was not my fault, a  virus hit the country and I was a part of a mass layoff. But do you see  how race played into my emotional state, something most others wouldn\u2019t  have to deal with?\n\nSo please, when you see Black Lives Matter, when you see protest, know that all we\u2019re asking for is change. Yes we have civil rights, but why are you scoffing at us asking for more? Why are we expected to accept the bare minimum? As a kid (mind you I was born in 1996) I was given the talk that my skin means I have to conduct myself a certain way, in certain environments, for my own safety. That people will fear me for simply having too much melanin. That I will be black first, yourelovely second until I die. I am trying my hardest to create a future where I don\u2019t have to give my kids that same speech, where I don\u2019t have to pass down that generational trauma.\n\nIf you have questions about the protesting, the movement, modern racism- ask me please! I know it can be a heated topic and the only way to change that is to have an open dialogue and educate. This is me offering the olive branch, me saying I am hurting and still have nothing but love in my heart. Too often we are too busy trying to share our thoughts that we don\u2019t hear others.\n\nEDIT: I've gotten a lovely amount of responses- I'm in Boston &amp; its currently 12:13 am, I'm trying to get a semi-regular sleep schedule on track so I'll probably be heading to bed soon, please know if I don't get back to you tonight I will tomorrow! All love &amp; hugs from me, thank you for making a girl feel heard",

                                    "comment": "I  saw an ELI5 a few years ago that stuck with me. \n\n&gt; Imagine that you're sitting down to dinner with your family, and while everyone else gets a serving of the meal, you don't get any. So you say \"I should get my fair share.\" And as a direct response to this, your dad corrects you, saying, \"everyone should get their fair share.\" Now, that's a wonderful sentiment -- indeed, everyone should, and that was kinda your point in the first place: that you should be a part of everyone, and you should get your fair share also. However, dad's smart-ass comment just dismissed you and didn't solve the problem that you still haven't gotten any!\n\n&gt; The problem is that the statement \"I should get my fair share\" had an implicit \"too\" at the end: \"I should get my fair share, too, just like everyone else.\" But your dad's response treated your statement as though you meant \"only I should get my fair share\", which clearly was not your intention. As a result, his statement that \"everyone should get their fair share,\" while true, only served to ignore the problem you were trying to point out.\n\n&gt; That's the situation of the \"black lives matter\" movement. Culture, laws, the arts, religion, and everyone else repeatedly suggest that all lives should matter. Clearly, that message already abounds in our society.\n\n&gt; The problem is that, in practice, the world doesn't work the way. You see the film Nightcrawler? You know the part where Renee Russo tells Jake Gyllenhal that she doesn't want footage of a black or latino person dying, she wants news stories about affluent white people being killed? That's not made up out of whole cloth -- there is a news bias toward stories that the majority of the audience (who are white) can identify with. So when a young black man gets killed (prior to the recent police shootings), it's generally not considered \"news\", while a middle-aged white woman being killed is treated as news. And to a large degree, that is accurate -- young black men are killed in significantly disproportionate numbers, which is why we don't treat it as anything new. But the result is that, societally, we don't pay as much attention to certain people's deaths as we do to others. So, currently, we don't treat all lives as though they matter equally.\n\n&gt; Just like asking dad for your fair share, the phrase \"black lives matter\" also has an implicit \"too\" at the end: it's saying that black lives should also matter. But responding to this by saying \"all lives matter\" is willfully going back to ignoring the problem. It's a way of dismissing the statement by falsely suggesting that it means \"only black lives matter,\" when that is obviously not the case. And so saying \"all lives matter\" as a direct response to \"black lives matter\" is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem.\n\n&gt;  TL;DR: The phrase \"Black lives matter\" carries an implicit \"too\" at the end; it's saying that black lives should also matter. Saying \"all lives matter\" is dismissing the very problems that the phrase is trying to draw attention to.\n\n[link to original](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3du1qm/eli5_why_is_it_so_controversial_when_someone_says/) and credit to /u/GeekAesthete",

I don't recall his name or know much about him but he happens to be black and I happen to be white.\n\nMy question is this: I want him to know... \n\n\n\n\nI just sat here for a minute trying to figure out what I want him to know and what I'm asking. I want him to know I consider him a friend even though I don't know him (he's always nice and I see him several times a week). I want him to know I know I have no idea (nor will I ever have any idea) what he has to go through on a regular basis and has had to endure already simply because of the color of his skin. I want him to know that I hope he's doing okay... or at least as okay as can be expected right now. I want him to know that I don't know what the fuck to do or say or feel right now but that even though I can't know the level of hurt he's feeling... he's not alone in hurting and I hurt for him and for all of us. I don't know what else to say.\n\nI guess my stupid question is... is it offensive or racist to want to tell him some of these things or offer some sort of comfort or support or *something* because he's a member of the black community? \n\n\nI'm sorry if this is really stupid or doesn't make much sense, I'm a little lost right now.",

Potentially this could also be applied to university admissions.\n\n I'm sure there's a bunch of logistical issues with a policy like this but I think it has potential and if anyone has holes to poke in it I ask that they come at it from a place of finding solutions to those and not just shut it down as a nope.",

George Floyd committing a petty crime doesn't make the officer's grossly excessive force more acceptable, and protesters being victimized by cops doesn't give people a free pass to attack cops in other cities.\n\nAnother problem is also assuming that everyone in a group is monolithic until proven otherwise. You know the kind. \"If there were *really* any good people in [group X], they'd be resoundingly condemning [bad thing someone in group X did]. But they aren't, so what does that tell you about them?\" Whether it's protesters and looting, or police and excessive force, and despite plenty of articles of people from those groups condemning those actions, it seems people on this site are willfully being ignorant or saying that it's too small a group to count because it would contrast with their narrative.",

I don\u2019t know anyone who thinks that the cop was in any way justified for what he did.  Not one person.\n\nThe police need to police themselves.  The senseless violence and brutality is bad enough by itself, but when cops stand idly by while one (or more) of them is brutally beating the shit out of someone, that\u2019s where they lose all credibility and support.\n\nI saw a sports figure (don\u2019t remember who) who yesterday said that what \u201cyou people who are outraged\u201d need to understand is that things like this happen to people in the black community EVERY DAY.  While I think most people know that, it drives the point home that, unfortunately, a segment of people live in fear of this happening to them every single day.\n\nThe police need to exercise restraint.  We aren\u2019t Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union.  Our police are supposed to protect us, not threaten us.  Yes, being a cop is a tough job, but no one is being forced to be a cop, so the fact that it\u2019s a tough job is a lame excuse.  In many jobs, if you can\u2019t perform, you get fired.  With the cops, it\u2019s a different story.  Does it take killing a detainee and weeks of riots to get someone fired, let alone prosecuted?\n\nThe way to have this not happen again is to pressure those in authority to take decisive action and clean house.  It\u2019s been gradually happening in other parts of society, whether it\u2019s corporate malfeasance putting executives in jail (that happens more now than in the past) or a slimebag like Harvey Weinstein finally paying a heavy price for being an absolute disgusting pig.  It\u2019s time for the cops to step up and stop the stupid shit that happens in their ranks every single day, and if they can\u2019t handle their jobs, get rid of them.",

They were very kind to me when I asked if I could take  and document, when I explained that I would not post them under my own name out of respect for the tragic event, and as I set up my camera. All they did was give me their blessing, nod, and go back to yelling \"Fuck Racism! Fuck the KKK!\", \u201cWhat do we want? Justice!\u201d, \u201cWhat was his name? George Floyd!\u201d, and \u201cPeace! Love! Unity!\u201d on loop.\n\nIt was a older white male-a good 'ol southern boy-who started the first skirmish. He yelled at the protesters, telling them to shut up about the KKK as they couldn't possibly understand, and told them if they didn't comply he would \\*make\\* them. When they continued to protest, he walked up to them and begun to yell even louder. He jabbed a finger towards them and when a protestor did it back, defending their personal space, he screamed that they had better not do it again.\n\nPolice surrounded the town square a minute later. Sirens on, lights blazing, as officers descended on the scene. The officers behaved as they should have. They separated the protestors and the man. Officers stayed with the protesters, even as they started chanting again, while others appeared to be interrogating the man. As I walked back to my car, the man was in cuffs being led to a police car.\n\nAs I pulled out of my parking spot, all the police cars were gone and the protest had resumed peacefully...\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe protesters, while I was there,  were not the issue.

Let them know that you'll stand up for them regardless of what you think or feel.\n\nIf you want help trying to understand it..think of it this way:\n\nJohn's son is killed in a car accident. John ask his friends to come over and be with him because he needs support and love from them. All of his friends still have healthy and living kids so they dont understand. So instead they say \"Just know that a lot of kids die everyday. It's not just your kid that died. It's happened to a lot of kids.\"\n\nTechnically, John's friends are correct, kids do die everyday, but it wasnt the response John needed. John needed their support and empathy for his loss. He needed them to focus on helping him in that moment. \n\nThat's what Black Lives Matters is all about.  Be there for your black friends and family. Let them know you'll stand with them.\n\n\nIf I've butchered this in any way please correct me. I'm still learning as I go.\n\nBlack lives matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n- The FORMER south Georgia racist redneck",

George Floyd was murdered by a man and a group of 3 other men that watched it all happen and did nothing. All of them swore an oath to protect and serve and simply didn't.\n\nThe protestors who are peaceful are getting drowned by the looters and I hate it. I haven't gone out to protest because I'm terrified of things getting out of hand and the virus. I personally lost my childhood best friend and my mom's best friend who was like another mother me to this virus and I'm still shook. I can't bring myself to large gatherings yet, it will take me a while.\n\nAs a white conservative-leaning male, I believe both sides aren't doing anything. What I believe the people simply want is justice and equality. We need to call on both sides of the aisle and ask for accountability among law enforcement. How is it that a man with a tarnished record was able to carry on his duty as a police officer? There needs to be put forth a law stating that those who protect and serve should be held to a higher standard and potentially make it standard to wear a body camera so when there are altercations, we have a witness. I know there is no one solution to all this but we can start somewhere.\n\nNow will that end all the racism? Absolutely not. We all have to join in the effort of stopping racism in our everyday lives no matter your skin color. We need to teach our next generation that there is no black, white, yellow or brown races; there is the human race. If you pass by somebody of color, simply smile or wave. Start up a conversation with someone you normally wouldn't with a simple \"Hi my name is (name), and you are? Well it's nice to meet you  How are you? How is your day?\" That alone might make someone's day and start to ease some of your own bias.\n\nSomething I haven't mentioned yet is my profession. I am a high school teacher in a very mixed community. We have students of all races and socio-economic backgrounds in our buildings. We have students who are food insecure sitting next to kids who will only eat food from whole foods. I wish I was in school right now. So I can tell all my students of color all this. So I can dab them up and let them know I am here for them. It's hard to convey that message over zoom. It's hard to take class time to talk about their feelings. I'd do anything to get that all back.\n\nSo as a white conservative-leaning male, I'm with you all and I hope for a brighter future with fairness and equality. I pray for a brighter and more fair future. I promise that I will always be in support of the human race.",

            "comment": "Progression? Well, I was quite surprised when I had seen Joe Biden's recent speech, as he called for a special independent force to investigate officer involved crimes. A solution that, I often wondered why, was not the pivotal demand of protestors. \n\nContrary to what some people think, the police are not who make the decision to charge someone with a crime. Police do wield tremendous investigatory and persuasive power, but the decision of whether or not to officially charge a person with a crime lies with the prosecutor, who will be the local district attorney if you are charged with a state-level crime, or the U.S. District Attorney if you are charged with a federal crime.\n\nThere is an inherent conflict of interest in the American justice system arising out of the intimate police-prosecutor relationship that has evolved in the United States over the last forty years. While police and prosecutors formerly operated as independent units, a concerted effort to join forces has resulted in close working relationships. These relationships have increasingly led law enforcement to employ perjury and unethical tactics to obtain unjust convictions against criminal defendants. In addition, they have allowed law enforcement to commit atrocious acts without fear of punishment. And, because police and prosecutors enjoy immunity under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for almost any conduct, victims and their families are often left without recourse in either a criminal or civil forum\u2014even when law enforcement officials commit criminal, malicious, or bad faith acts against them. \n\n&gt; \u201cProsecutors work with police day in, day out, and typically they\u2019re reluctant to criticise them or investigate them,\u201d said Prof Samuel Walker of the University of Nebraska. Describing Lugod\u2019s case as a cause for concern, Walker said: \u201cA major change in our standard legal practice, and the structure of our criminal justice system, is required.\u201d\n\n&gt; Among the 95% of district attorneys who are elected, many like Kleine receive valuable donations and public endorsements from police unions for their campaigns. The alternative, a \u201csoft on crime\u201d denunciation, can be electorally toxic. These unions frequently go on to provide legal representation for officers in fatal shootings handled by the same prosecutor.\n\n&gt; The consequences of falling out of favour with the police lobby can be dire. In Texas, Dallas County DA Craig Watkins was unseated by challenger Susan Hawk this year after police unions ploughed tens of thousands of dollars into Hawk\u2019s campaign, and officers took to the streets to knock on doors for her. Their intervention followed the indictment of four police officers by grand juries under Watkins\u2019 oversight in 2014. \n\n -[Ties that bind: how the bond between police and prosecutors impedes justice](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/ties-that-bind-conflicts-of-interest-police-killings)\n\n Friendships, donations, fear of powerful police unions, fear of losing cases and being forced to face the repercussions. These are the hurdles that a prosecutor must overcome before criminally charging their police counterpart. It creates an apparent conflict of interest that often leads to an abnormally large margin of dismissed cases. \n\n[Charging officers with crimes is still difficult for prosecutors](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2020/05/29/charging-cops-with-crimes-is-still-difficult-prosecutors/%3foutputType=amp)",

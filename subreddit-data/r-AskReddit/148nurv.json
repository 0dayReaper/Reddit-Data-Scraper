I just had to walk up a trail for a bit AND THEN cross a very wide road. The crosswalk thing didn't work, so I had to crossy road style my way across the street. Afterwards, I had to pass a high school and several confused looks. Finally, I reached my school about 30 minutes late. That was a whole adventure. Why didn't I just wait for my mother to get back from work? (For extra context, my father was divorced so I didn't get to ask him, plus I had no phone)",

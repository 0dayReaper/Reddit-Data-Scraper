If I forget, right around 8:15 they will get up and start badgering me until they get fed.  \n\n\nAlso, I get up at 9am for work every day.  I let them out at that time.  On the weekends - when I really want to be sleeping in - 9am without fail they are up and grabbing chew toys and squeaking them in my ear until I get up.  \n\n\nPersistent bastards.",

Might suggest the study of metals and alloys and when we use what kind. He's always talking about the different eras of human history (primitive age, modern age, future age etc) so it'd be a good segue to Iron age, bronze age.\n\nEditing again to add, since it's been mentioned in so many replies, apparently the podcast \"Ologies\" is like this, may not have the most family friendly vocabulary, but I don't know I haven't listened to any of it.",

We talked about oil spills and cleaning the sea creatures after. We talked about dolphins getting tangled in fishing nets. We even talked about how we haven't fully explored the oceans yet and there could be new creatures that no one has ever seen. It was a really cool conversation to have with her.",

But today, although humans and chimpanzees share 99 per cent of the DNA sequences that code for proteins, that DNA is packaged differently into the chromosomes.\n\n&gt;The human chromosome number two is actually two ape chromosomes joined end-to-end, and nine other chromosomes have inverted sequences of genes compared with their equivalents in chimps. Humans and chimps also have differences in their individual genes that are far bigger than the differences between any two unrelated humans.\n\n&gt;These are big obstacles, but not necessarily insurmountable. Other animals with comparable genetic differences, such as zebras and horses, have bred successfully in the past, although the offspring are almost always sterile. There are documented cases of Soviet experiments in the 1920s where artificial insemination was attempted using female chimps and human sperm. However, none of these experiments resulted in a pregnancy, much less the birth of a \u2018humanzee\u2019. There are various urban legends of other later experiments in different labs worldwide, but there\u2019s no evidence that the result was ever any different.",

Because of that, their ovaries won't develop properly which makes them infertile. Only queen bees get gelee royale through all stages of their development in the cell, which makes them fertile and significantly bigger. So, if the queen bee dies suddenly or gets too old, the worker bees start feeding the larvae with gelee royale to raise a new queen.",

            "comment": "Mine is 'hootenanny':\n\n&gt;Placeholder - Hootenanny is an Appalachian colloquialism that was used in the early twentieth century U.S. as a placeholder name to refer to things whose names were forgotten or unknown. In this usage it was synonymous with thingamajig or whatchamacallit, as in: \"Hand me that hootenanny.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Party - Hootenanny was also an old country word for \"party\". It can refer to a folk music party with an open mic, at which different performers are welcome to get up and play in front of an audience. \\[[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hootenanny)\\]",

Shindig, dip, less mellow song stylings, perhaps a large amount of malt beverage, and hootenanny, well, it's chock full of hoot, just a little bit of nanny.",

            "comment": "The ancient Assyrians built a vast empire. The empire reached its height during the Neo-Assyrian era, from 911 BC to the fall of its largest city Nineveh in 612 BC.\n\nThe Assyrian dominion, stretching from Egypt to modern-day Iraq, controlled richly diverse cultures. To quash any uprising in these conquered areas, Assyrian leaders utilized extreme violence. Their horrific campaigns were celebrated in stone reliefs festooning the palace walls.\n\nThey created tablets containing every single punishment the Assyrian army carried out. They cut off the limbs, gouged out the eyes, and then left those poor victims to roam around. Those poor people serve as a living reminder of the Assyrians\u2019 cruelty. The Assyrians were proud of the mass executions. The victim\u2019s skin was hung on the city wall. The brutality of the Assyrians was extreme, even for the ancient standards of cruelty.\u00a0",

Here's an example:\n\n# Nahum 3:1-7, 18-19\n\n^(1) Woe to the bloody city,  \nall full of lies and plunder\u2014  \nno end to the prey!  \n^(2) The crack of the whip, and rumble of the wheel,  \ngalloping horse and bounding chariot!  \n^(3) Horsemen charging,  \nflashing sword and glittering spear,  \nhosts of slain,  \nheaps of corpses,  \ndead bodies without end\u2014  \nthey stumble over the bodies!  \n^(4) And all for the countless whorings of the prostitute,  \ngraceful and of deadly charms,  \nwho betrays nations with her whorings,  \nand peoples with her charms.  \n^(5) Behold, I am against you,  \ndeclares the Lord of hosts,  \nand will lift up your skirts over your face;  \nand I will make nations look at your nakedness  \nand kingdoms at your shame.  \n^(6) I will throw filth at you  \nand treat you with contempt  \nand make you a spectacle.  \n^(7) And all who look at you will shrink from you and say,  \n\u201cWasted is Nineveh; who will grieve for her?\u201d  \nWhere shall I seek comforters for you? \u2026\n\n\u2026 ^(18) Your shepherds are asleep,  \nO king of Assyria;  \nyour nobles slumber.  \nYour people are scattered on the mountains  \nwith none to gather them.  \n^(19) There is no easing your hurt;  \nyour wound is grievous.  \nAll who hear the news about you  \nclap their hands over you.  \nFor upon whom has not come  \nyour unceasing evil?\n\n\u2014\n\nIn the period of the divided kingdom, where the Israelites had divided into a northern kingdom (the Kingdom of Israel) and a southern kingdom (the Kingdom of Judah), the Assyrians invaded and conquered the Kingdom of Israel, and exiled its people, re-settling them in other territories in order to wipe out their identity. Other vanquished peoples were also re-settled in Israel. But in conquering Israel, Assyria was just as typically cruel as they were to the other peoples they conquered. They attempted to conquer Judah as well during the reign of Hezekiah, but they only lay waste dozens of other cities, but they did not end up conquering Jerusalem. \n\nThere is a stele of the Assyrian king Sennacherib III  in the British Museum made by the Assyrians commemorating how they lay waste to the town of Lachish, and brutalized its inhabitants with vicious tortures, skinning them alive and pulling them apart and other barbaric acts.",

Though in this case the eunuchs were probably the bigger problem than the porn, as involving them in politics was considered one of the biggest mistakes of the Ming dynasty.",

            "comment": "Sparta.\n\nSparta has a reputation as no-nonsense badasses who dedicated their lives to become ultimate warriors. People know they were ruthless and had slaves, but the total depravity and sheer stupidity of Sparta eludes common knowledge. Sparta was an extremely oppressive state where a small elite enslaved 90+ % of society and killed them for sport. But being in the elite wasn\u2019t much better: the education system was pure abuse, and produced traumatised close-minded men incapable of anything else except heaping the same brutality on the next generation. The elite Spartiate class was a closed class: you couldn\u2019t become one no matter of your services to Sparta, but it was possible to lose Spartiate status. The Spartiate class became smaller and smaller as the years went on, eventually becoming too weak to keep Sparta alive. And all this didn\u2019t even produce better soldiers. \n\n[Historian Bret Devereaux has an essay series on Sparta on his blog](https://acoup.blog/2019/08/16/collections-this-isnt-sparta-part-i-spartan-school/). Highly recommended for people interested in ancient history.\n\nFrom the conclusion:\n\n&gt;And I want to stress this one last time, because I know there are so many people who would pardon all of Sparta\u2019s ills if it meant that it created superlative soldiers: it did not. Spartan soldiers were average. The horror of the Spartan system, the nastiness of the agoge, the oppression of the helots, the regimentation of daily life, it was all for nothing. Worse yet, it created a Spartan leadership class that seemed incapable of thinking its way around even basic problems. All of that supposedly cool stuff made Sparta weaker, not stronger.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[\u2026\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sparta was \u2013 if you will permit the comparison \u2013 an ancient North Korea. An over-militarized, paranoid state which was able only to protect its own systems of internal brutality and which added only oppression to the sum of the human experience. Little more than an extraordinarily effective prison, metastasized to the level of a state. There is nothing of redeeming value here.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sparta is not something to be emulated. It is a cautionary tale.",

He was never racist, probably because he knew Japanese- and German-Americans are often in the US because they were fleeing their countries' conditions (this grandpap, my Pap, was my mom's step-dad, my dad's dad was German and Pap knew his story so I'm sure that helped), but he strongly boycotted anything from any country he percieved as not atoning enough for their actions during WWII.",

Why such a huge range? Well, when people are murdered for funsies, forced to cannibalize the dead, and prone to hurling themselves off cliffs, a ton of evidence is destroyed and it gets really hard to narrow it down.",

            "comment": "Not sure if it counts as \"ancient\" or \"fucked up\", but there are indications that the Merovingians had some pretty interesting burial practices. There have been excavations where they found people surrounded by multiple heads, indications that graves where set on fire, indications of immobilization of the dead (hand and feet bound, for example), etc. In most cases the last example can be seen as merely a ritual thing, but in some cases excavators claim people were buried alive. There's also increasing evidence that these people re-opened grave some time after burial to take/bury/exchange body parts and objects (kind of like the saints cults that took off a bit later in the same regions). Again, it's not really fucked up imo because it doesn't harm living people, and I'm cautious about playing into the whole Dark and Violent Middle Ages thing, but it's definitely interesting and unexpected for most people. Especially since most high school classes depict the Merovingians as the first Christians in the region, and these practices definitely took place beyond Christianisation in the area.",

Entire unknown civilizations are reportedly wiped out by them with zero trace of their culture intact, just fields of bones saying something big *was* there. \n\nThere was at least one incident of a drunken Mongolian post-raid demanding a group of runaways remain still while he stumbled off to find his sword and kill them, and they **did** out of fear for what would happen had they not \n\nThere was an instance of a relatively small recon element of Mongolians who were sent over some mountains in IIRC modern day Russia-ish region just to see what over there, stumbled onto an entire joint nation army, and merced them all conquering the whole damn place\n\nThe Khans were a hard people. Oddly enough tho, they were relatively progressive for their time. Once you/your people were conquered, they didn't really care what you did/spoke/believed as long as you paid your tributes. They even protected from outside raiders. It's just, y'know, the whole getting massacred and conquered part to deal with\n\nSource: Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast *Wrath of the Khans*, and memory\n\n*There was one instance of their unique brutalism that came back to mind. So being the 'progressive' conquerors they were, they pretty regularly honored the beliefs and Gods of their enemies. In one such instance they'd sacked and captured a host of nobles who believed it was unholy to spill \"high\" blood. In response, the Mongolians decided to honor their traditions and rather than cut them to pieces, they laid the nobles flat, built a dancefloor on top of them, and partied like hell while the nobles were crushed underneath. No blood was \"spilled\"",

The Spanish were able to recruit the help of many other people groups when overthrowing the Aztecs because they were so hated by the people they subjugated. They often used these subjugated people groups practically as livestock, collecting large numbers of them to be ritually sacrificed to their gods in incredibly barbaric ways\u2014riping out their beating hearts while they were alive, skinning them, and other such acts.\n\nThey sacrificed children to their rain god every year to ensure that they would keep getting rain. The tears of the children were thought to bring the rain, so they  would torture the children ahead of sacrificing them to their rain god Tl\u0101loc to make them shed as many tears as possible.\n\n[Wikipedia's entry on Aztec human sacrifice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice_in_Aztec_culture#Tlaloc) says:\n\n&gt;Tlaloc is the god of rain, water, and earthly fertility.\\[43\\] The Aztecs believed that if sacrifices were not supplied for Tlaloc, rain would not come, their crops would not flourish, and leprosy and rheumatism, diseases caused by Tlaloc, would infest the village.\\[44\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Archaeologists have found the remains of at least 42 children sacrificed to Tlaloc at the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan. **Many of the children suffered from serious injuries before their death, they would have to have been in significant pain as Tlaloc required the tears of the young as part of the sacrifice. The priests made the children cry during their way to immolation**: a good omen that Tlaloc would wet the earth in the raining season.\\[45\\]\n\n[Wikipedia's entry on Tl\u0101loc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tl%C4%81loc#Child_Sacrifice_and_Rituals), in the section on child sacrifice rituals, says:\n\n&gt;The Atlcahualo festivals was celebrated from 12 February until 3 March. Dedicated to the Tlaloque, this veintena involved the sacrifice of children on sacred mountaintops, like Mount Tlaloc. **This form of human sacrifice was not only specific, but necessary in the eyes of the Aztecs.** The children were beautifully adorned, dressed in the style of Tlaloc and the Tlaloque. The children were \"chosen\" by the community, and although this selection came with honor, being selected came with great responsibility. Furthermore, **these children were not usually of high social class.** \u2026  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The festival of Tozoztontli (24 March \u2013 12 April) similarly involved child sacrifice. **During this festival, the children were sacrificed in caves. The flayed skins of sacrificial victims that had been worn by priests for the last twenty days** were taken off and placed in these dark, magical caverns.",

It wasn't meant to be malicious.\n\n&gt;In 1323, they asked the new ruler of Culhuacan, Achicometl, for his daughter, in order to make her the goddess Yaocihuatl. Unknown to the king, the Mexica actually planned to sacrifice her. The Mexica believed that by doing this the princess would join the gods as a deity. As the story goes, during a festival dinner, a priest came out wearing her flayed skin as part of the ritual. Upon seeing this, the king and the people of Culhuacan were horrified and expelled the Mexica.\n\nWe'll never know if it's a true story or not, but the Aztec did do some fucked up stuff. But seeing as our sources are the Aztec themselves (hard to distinguish fact from legend) and the conquistadors, who knows.",

Also, supposedly the Egyptians are dated as far back as well.  4000 BC.  So 6000 years ago.  That's all we've got of recorded human history.  6000 years.\n\nHumans have been around for WAY long than 6000 years.\n\nThe first modern humans, or Homo Sapiens, date back 200,000 years.    That's 33x as long as recorded human civilization.  Imagine the type of shit that went down.  It wasn't just a bunch of random monkey looking people hanging out by themselves.  They absolutely got banded up into tribes and you know they went to war with each other.  \n\nThey could have built entire civilizations and burnt them down repeatedly.  200,000 years is a LOT of years to get up to shenanigans, ya know?  And it's completely lost to time.  Just, poof!  Gone.  As if it never happened.\n\nWhich is honestly what will happen to all human endeavor.  On the timescale of the Universe we're all just a fart in the wind.  No one will remember squat about this period of human history 200,000 years from now.  And what they do remember will be completely distorted from the truth.",

            "comment": "Samurai and feudal Japan. People like to imagine the Samurai as some kind of noble order built around the belief that honor and service were to be held above all. Samurai didn't give half a sideways fuck about the \"common peasant\" they were a blue blood aristocracy that used their power and training to perpetuate a totalitarian  regime that would make the house of Windsor blush. \n\nSome examples of the WTFness that people like to gloss over\n\n&gt; showing disrespect to a Samurai was cause for instant death and disrespect could be something as simple as not bowing low and long enough, oh mr old rice farm does your back hurt from slaving in the field for your feudal lord? well tough shit I dont care how loud your spine cracks when you touch your head to the ground for me, if you twitch that a beheading\n\n&gt; the code of battlefield honor only really counted when the loosing side put of just the right amount of fight, not enough to be a problem but you still had to do some pointless dyeing to keep from all being killed anyway. Example, Oda Nobunaga committed a genocide against the Ikk\u014d-ikki monks because they had the audacity to not insta cave when he showed up. After several long sieges he burned the hilltop fortress of Ishiyama Hongan-ji Oda set fire to the mountain and blocked any escape burning alive 20,000 men, woman and children\n\n&gt;The idea that Samurai hated fire arms because they saw them as \"dishonorable\" or \"unsporting\" is bullshit, they hated them because they evened the playing field. Any peasant with a Arquebus could kill any Samurai before he even got his sword out and that was not OK. They couldn't have their absolute marshal superiority questioned  and especially by a weapon that didn't require years is special training and more importantly, the free time to do that training, something your average rice farming peasant certainly didn't have. \n\n&gt;Ronnin were not noble samurai seeking truth through walking the land or whatever the fuck people believe now, they were dispossessed lords who were now turning to banditry against any peasant who dared to not support them with free food and lodging. They were the equivalent of a former seal team six member walking the road with his weapon who will kill you if you don't buy his lunch, let him sleep in your bed, fuck your wife and then bid him adu with a smile  and call of \"thankyou for your service\" \n\n\nSo yah, Samurai were aristocratic mass murdering assholes.\n\nEDIT: just to make it a bit more clear, the Boshin war which was waged at the start of Meji imperial restoration that pitted the Samurai class against the new Empirical court and standing army was fought 100% on the Samurai side to keep their protected class, the imperial court even tried to compromise and offer them high ranking government positions but it wasn't enough, they still wanted to keep their place is Japanese society and one of the stated rights they didn't want to loose was the right to carry swords in public for the purpose of \"protecting honor\" IE, Killing a commoner on the spot if they perceived any disrespect. Also the Samurai forces suddenly didn't have an issue with guns once they started loosing to ranks of peasants armed with them, suddenly the Shogun forces were all about that firearm life.",

Other Canaanite/Semitic peoples dropped this practice, depicted in the Tanakh (Bible's Old Testament) through the story of God sending a goat when Abraham was about to sacrifice his son.\n\nAlthough ancient Jews' annual ritualistic slaughter of thousands of animals is nothing to scoff at, murdering kids is obviously far worse. Even the Phoenicians' peers, contemporary cultures/civilizations of the period, thought it to be a barbarous practice.\n\nHere's Plato on the subject:\n&gt; \"With us, for instance, human sacrifice is not legal, but unholy, whereas the Carthaginians perform it as a thing they account holy and legal, and that too when some of them sacrifice even their own sons to Cronos, as I daresay you yourself have heard.\"\n\n\nIn one notable case, during the late Sicilian Wars, Carthage itself was almost besieged and defeated. It got so bad Carthaginian civilians had to be pressed into the army instead of relying on their mercenary army. Carthage scraped by a victory at the Battle of White Tunis, but since it was so terrible, they thought the gods were punishing them.\n\nSo in the aftermath of the battle, Carthaginian tried to appease the gods through, you guessed it, human sacrifice. 300 adults and 200 children were ritualistically murdered.\n\nHere is Diodorus Siculus describing the event:\n&gt; \"They also alleged that Kronos had turned against them inasmuch as in former times they had been accustomed to sacrifice to this god the noblest of their sons, but more recently, secretly buying and nurturing children, they had sent these to the sacrifice; and when an investigation was made, some of those who had been sacrificed were discovered to have been substituted by stealth... In their zeal to make amends for the omission, they selected two hundred of the noblest children and sacrificed them publicly; and others who were under suspicion sacrificed themselves voluntarily, in number not less than three hundred. There was in the city a bronze image of Kronos, extending its hands, palms up and sloping towards the ground, so that each of the children when placed thereon rolled down and fell into a sort of gaping pit filled with fire.\"",

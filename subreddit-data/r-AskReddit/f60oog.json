Five seconds in he screams loud enough that I\u2019m grounded before I ever tasted the soda. \n\nYears later, it was his turn to make sandwiches.

I had my parents watch The Zygon Invasion and The Zygon Inversion because it illustrates how detrimental the mentality of us versus them is, and how easy it is for people- good people- to get caught up in hatred and vility. The critical lessons we need are woven through obvious fiction. \n\n[I found the clip](https://youtu.be/BJP9o4BEziI), but sadly it cuts out the beginning which I think is important: \n&gt;The Doctor: \"YOU just want cruelty to be get cruelty. You're not superior to people who were cruel to you. You're just a whole bunch of new cruel people being cruel to some other people who will end up being cruel to you. The only way anyone can live in peace is if they're prepared to forgive.. Why don't you break the cycle?\"\n\n&gt;Bonnie: \"Why should we?\" \n\n&gt;The Doctor: \"What is it that you actually want?\"\n\n&gt;Bonnie: \"War.\" \n\n&gt;The Doctor: \"Ah. Ah. And when this war is over, when you have a homeland free from humans, what do you think it is going to be like? Do you know? Have you thought about it? Have you given it any consideration, because you\u2019re very close to getting what you want. What\u2019s it going to be like? Paint me a picture. Are you going to live in houses? Do you want people to go to work? Will there be holidays? Oh! Will there be music? Do you think people will be allowed to play violins? Who\u2019s going to make the violins? Well? Oh, you don\u2019t actually know, do you? Because like every other trantruming child in history, Bonnie, you don\u2019t actually know what you want. {speech picks up here} So let me ask you a question about this brave new world of yours...",

(I would link the post I got this off but idk how)\n\n\nThe Zygon Inversion - A Transcript of The Doctor's Speech\n\n*I've produced a basic transcript of the Doctor's speech at the end of last night's episode, The Zygon Inversion.* \n\n**The Doctor**:\nYou just want cruelty to beget cruelty. You're not superior to people who were cruel to you. You're just a whole bunch of new cruel people. A whole bunch of new cruel people, being cruel to some other people, who'll end up being cruel to you. The only way anyone can live in peace is if they're prepared to forgive. Why don't you break the cycle?\n\n**Bonnie**: Why should we?\n\n**The Doctor**: What is it that you actually want?\n\n**Bonnie**: War.\n\n**The Doctor**: Ah. And when this war is over, when -- when you have the homeland free from humans, what do you think it's going to be like? Do you know? Have you thought about it? Have you given it any consideration? Because you're very close to getting what you want. What's it going to be like? Paint me a picture. Are you going to live in houses? Do you want people to go to work? What'll be holidays? Oh! Will there be music? Do you think people will be allowed to play violins? Who will make the violins? Well? Oh, You don't actually know, do you? Because, just like every other tantruming child in history, Bonnie, you don't actually know what you want. So, let me ask you a question about this brave new world of yours. When you've killed all the bad guys, and it's all perfect and just and fair, when you have finally got it exactly the way you want it, what are you going to do with the people like you? The troublemakers. How are you going to protect your glorious revolution from the next one?\n\n**Bonnie**: We'll win.\n\n**Doctor**: Oh, will you? Well maybe -- maybe you will win. But nobody wins for long. The wheel just keepts turning. So, come on. Break the cycle.\n\n**Bonnie**: Then why are you still talking?\n\n**The Doctor**: Because I'm trying to get you to see. And I'm almost there.\n\n**Bonnie**: Do you know what I see, Doctor? A box. A box with everything I need. A 50% chance.\n\n**Kate**: For us, too.\n\n[The Doctor sighs.] \n\n**The Doctor**: And we're off! Fingers on buzzers! Are you feeling lucky? Are you ready to play the game? Who's going to be quickest? Who's going to be the luckiest?\n\n**Kate**: This is not a game!\n\n**The Doctor**: No, it's not a game, sweetheart, and I mean that most sincerely.\n\n**Bonnie**: Why are you doing this?\n\n**Kate**: Yes, I'd like to know that too. You set this up -- why?\n\n**The Doctor**: Because it's not a game, Kate. This is a scale model of war. Every war ever fought right there in front of you. Because it's always the same. When you fire that first shot, no matter how right you feel, you have no idea who's going to die. You don't know who's children are going to scream and burn. How many hearts will be broken! How many lives shattered! How much blood will spill until everybody does what they're always going to have to do from the very beginning -- sit down and talk!\nListen to me, listen. I just -- I just want you to think. Do you know what thinking is? It's just a fancy word for changing your mind.\n\n**Bonnie**: I will not change my mind.\n\n**The Doctor**: Then you will die stupid. Alternatively, you could step away from that box. You could walk right out of that door, and you could stand your revolution down.\n\n**Bonnie**: No, I'm not stopping this, Doctor. I started it. I will not stop it. You think they'll let me go after what I've done?\n\n**The Doctor**: You're all the same, you screaming kids, you know that? \"Look at me, I'm unforgivable.\" Well here's the unforeseeable, I forgive you. After all you've done. I forgive you.\n\n**Bonnie**: You don't understand. You will never understand.\n\n**The Doctor**: I don't understand? Are you kidding? Me? Of course I understand. I mean, do you call this a war, this funny little thing? This is not a war. I fought in a bigger war than you will ever know. I did worse things than you could ever imagine, and when I close my eyes... I hear more screams than anyone could ever be able to count! And do you know what you do with all that pain? Shall I tell you where you put it? You hold it tight... Til it burns your hand. And you say this -- no one else will ever have to live like this. No one else will ever have to feel this pain. Not on my watch.\n\n[Kate closes her box.]\n\n**The Doctor**: Thank you. Thank you.\n\n**Kate**: I'm sorry.\n\n**The Doctor**: I know. I know, thank you.\n\n[The Doctor looks back to Bonnie.]\n\nWell?\n\n**Bonnie**: It's empty, isn't it? Both boxes -- there's nothing in them. Just buttons.\n\n**The Doctor**: Of course. But you know how you know that? Because you've started to think like me. It's hell, isn't it? No one should have to think like that. And no one will. Not on our watch.\n\n[The Doctor and Bonnie stare at one another for a moment.]\n\n**The Doctor**: Gotcha.\n\n**Bonnie**: How can you be so sure?\n\n**The Doctor**: Because you have a disadvantage, Zygella. I know that face.\n\n**Kate**: Well, this is all very well, but as know the boxes are empty now. We can't forget that.\n\n**The Doctor**: No, well, uh... You've said that the last 15 times.\n\n[The Doctor uses his sunglasses, which begin pulsing.]\n\n**Bonnie**: You didn't wipe my memory.\n\n**The Doctor**: No. Just Kate's. Oh, and your little friends here, of course. When they wake up, they won't remember what you've done. It'll be our secret.\n\n**Bonnie**: You're going to protect me?\n\n**Osgood**: Well, you're one of us now, whether you like it or not.\n\n**Bonnie**: I don't understand how You could just forgive me.\n\n**The Doctor**: Because I've been where you have. There was another box. I was gonna press another button. I was going to wipe out all of my own kind. Man, woman, and child. I was so sure I was right.\n\n**Bonnie**: What happened?\n\n**The Doctor**: Same thing that happened to you. I let Clara Oswald get inside my head.\n\n[The Doctor looks at Clara.] \n\n**The Doctor**: Trust me... She doesn't leave.",

They can't decide how to equitably split the land. Father tells them that one must draw the boundary, and the other gets to pick which portion he wants. So whoever draws the boundary wants to make it as fair as possible since he doesn't get to choose which portion he gets.",

But to divide discrete objects, or quantities of objects where the participants' preferences vary, it's not ideal.\n\nThe problem with discrete objects is more obvious: if you and I are asked to split 3 opera tickets, I'd rather be the one choosing than the one splitting! The most even trade you can offer is 2:1, and I'll happily take the 2. Throwing away the spare ticket achieves fairness, but is wasteful.\n\nDifferent preferences can make a difference even when we don't need to split an indivisible object. Suppose I prefer apples to oranges, and you prefer oranges to apples, and we have 4 of each to split. If I have to offer a split, and I don't know that you prefer oranges, I would split into two piles, each with two apples and two oranges. That looks fair to you, so you pick one pile arbitrarily, and we're both moderately satisfied. But if we could negotiate more, we could reach a trade that leaves *both* of us happier: I'll take all the apples, and you can have all the gross oranges your heart desires.",

Rawls (one of the judges) revealed that, though he may be a second tier philosopher, he is still very much alive (this was in the 80s or 90s).  Everyone laughed uproariously, etc. etc.\n\nDoes anyone else remember hearing this story?",

All good politicians can spin a load of bullshit that sounds nice that the average voter isn't going to fully decipher.  \n\nIf Politician A promises to get you a program with out comes you like, and promises that we can easily pay for it and implement it, most people are not equipped to challenge that assertion of \"this will be easy and cheap\".   Politician B is fully equipped and strongly incentivized to challenge the assertion, especially if it is untrue.\n\nAn adversarial process is a good thing.  I think that debates are good in that they provide a place where the politicians don't fully control their message and are up against people that disagree with them.  I think that that is pretty important.\n\nI too would like a different debate format, but I would want to keep the adversarial nature.  I want candidate A to explain why candidate B is wrong, not just hear candidate A tell me why they are right, and then hear candidate B tell me why they are right.  The last thing I want to hear is an hour long campaign speech.  I can hear that any time I want.  \n\nI want their ideas attacked.  Their ideas *need* to be attacked.  Any debate format that doesn't keep that isn't worth it.",

Starting with these types of threads (the opposite of what this subreddit should be about).\n\nFollowed by no-effort upvote-magnet responses like Q:\"What TV show has a really interesting storyline?\" A:\"Game of Thrones\", Q:\"Firefly\" etc. Thousands of upvote, nothing actually interesting to talk about.\n\nOr how about answers that are just the same old quotes from *The Office*, starting a comment chain with every single one comment being an overused quote or \"/r/unexpectedoffice\".\n\nAlso references to media (mostly video games) that don't specify what you are describing because of course you are only preaching to the choir and counting on upvotes from other fans, and not actually trying to advocate for your favorite medium to a general audience and to make an actual argument for it e.g. Q:\"What character has the best redemption story?\" A:\"Johny after murdering Suzy Q\". What's the point I mean what is the bloody point of such a comment other than to get upvotes from people who know what this references?!\n\nI feel like 95% of /r/AskReddit threads are people just patting themselves on the back for repeating the same stuff over and over.",

            "comment": "I was driving one day and listening to a very popular radio station in my region. And I saw all cars around me on the highway swerve a little bit when a commercial with sirens came on. Very dangerous stuff if you ask me.\n\nEdit: in the city close to where I live carnival is very popular and very well known, for about one month each year the festival gets their own radio station with loud obnoxious party music that is quite funny. Swerve is maybe an exaggeration but I saw the reaction of many drivers in my vicinity since the siren came on quite loud after the news bulletin.",

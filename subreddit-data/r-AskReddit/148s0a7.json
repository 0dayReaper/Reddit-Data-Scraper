Some are harder than others but man, getting rid of those scales under the bags in self checkout was a *mistake*. No one is paying attention to those cameras, the attendant does not get paid enough to give a shit. Buy a few things, make it look good. I basically ring up the cheapest stuff and just put expensive stuff into the bag with it. There is some artistry to it I guess but ya. I do this...I mean shit I'm gonna do this in about twenty minutes. For any FBI agents watching. Unless this has gone all the way up to the CIA because it's such a serious crime.\n\nAMA about regularly eating caviar as a poor.",

I scanned literally everything else, and accidentally buried the cotton swabs under the grocery bags.\n\nMore recently, however, was downloaded porn. I'll never pay for any of it.",

Lawn and Garden didn\u2019t have anyone at the register and the dirt I wanted was outside in the loading area, also unattended but not accessible from inside the store.

It was an antique (from the 70s)  and you can't get them any more.  My mother had the same one and she doesn't cook any more (I cook for both of us)  so I stole hers.  I keep it hidden when the bf comes over, though.",

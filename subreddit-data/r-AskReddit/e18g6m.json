These are post office addresses, not street addresses, and the post office would NOT tell us where the house was located because we were the competition. I stopped at the only store/gas station in town ('town' was this store, a feed/hardware store, and a bar). Every one stops what they're doing and turns to look at me when I walk in. No shit. This town is nowhere near a highway, they don't get many out of town visitors. I ask where so and so at this address lives. The cashier stared at me for the longest time, then tells me to take the road west out of town for so many miles and take a right at the old Johnson barn, then down another mile on the left. I ask what color the barn is, she tells me the barn is gone, I'm supposed to take a right where the old Johnson barn USED to be. Bahahaha!",

Ask to speak with a manager. Shake his hand, look him in the eye and ask for a job!\"\n\nEdit: This post brought to you by painful memories of job hunting during the 2008 recession. My dad was getting on my case every day about \"playing on the computer\" when I was checking job sites and going through their infuriating sites that make me upload my resume, then fill in fields that are on my resume three different times. Someone in the comments below dropped the classic \"Pound the pavement\" and I felt my blood pressure spike. Thanks.",

You're too dependent on smartphones for everything. Why are you setting up a doctor's appointment anyway? If you're not dying you don't need to go to the hospital. Back in my day you don't go to the doctors when you feel sick. You do what real men do and tough it out. Only sissy Nancy boys go to the doctors for feeling sick. Real men only go to the doctors when they have real problems like getting stabbed through the abdomen with a rusty bayonet from the VC or contracted syphilis from a Saigon whore.\"\n\nEdit: I forgot to put quotation marks.",

No rent, utilities, etc. They basically paid for food and stuff to keep us kids entertained. \n\nMy mom worked, but that\u2019s because my dad is very stingy with his money. \n\nHer and my dad all the time: \u201cWell when I was your age I had two kids, I lived out on my own, and I was paying for all of my own stuff!\u201d \n\nNo student loan debt. No real bills. No heavy expenses. Of course, when I point this out to them, they tell me that I should have gone into the military. \n\nI fucking hate the military.\n\nEdit to add: Thats a lot of upvotes and I\u2019m nervous y\u2019all \n\nHaving said this, please be respectful to people who are actively serving or who have retired from serving our country! While they chose a life path I disagree with, they do not deserve hate. We\u2019re all just good little beans trying to make it in this crazy world. Have a wonderful day, you beautiful creatures!",

Most people would look at an email address and assume that's where it's coming from because while spoofing emails isn't that common, if someone's spear phishing, they can make it look convincing.\n\nAnd he said, no, I'm asking how YOU tell if an email isn't legit or has a virus. What steps would you take to determine if an email is safe. \n\nAnd I said, if I had to dig further to find out whether an email is legit, I would have to look at the email header and determine whether the information there matches with the domain DNS. Maybe there's a dkim key. Maybe the mx record points to one server and the email was received from another. There are many other factors we can use, for example call the sender on your phone and see if they sent you something if it doesn't sound like an email they normally send you.\n\nAnd then he said, no, that's not what we're looking for. Why didn't you just do a virus scan on the computer? That tells you right away if there's a virus.\n\nI'm at a total loss of words. I forgot that not opening email attachments from suspicious sources isn't the default thing that people do.",

I see in your calendar that your flight boards at 10:30 and taking into account how it takes 30 minutes to get to the airport, that only leaves you with 1 hour to make it to your gate in time.

He was constantly bullying us, shit talking us TO CUSTOMERS, and doing everything in his power to make us miserable. Well, so many people complained about him that he ended up getting fired. \n\nNew manager was great. He was super chill and understanding with us all. A couple weeks after he took over, the old douchebag comes in and starts talking about how terrible the store looks, how our service is shittier than ever, and how much this store needs him. The new manager looked at him and said \"If you don't leave, then the cops are gonna make you\"\n\nWhen the douchebag didn't move, new awesome manager stuck to his guns and called the cops. The douchebag is no longer allowed on ANY McDonalds property in the city and has a restraining order against him.",

            "comment": "Well, this might be a long one.\n\nI grew up around a mother with dissociative disorder as well as narcissism. She was addicted to opiates as far back as I can remember, and would do anything to get them, and I mean anything.\n\nGrowing up, it wasn't rare for her to have a tantrum during one of her highs and beat the shit out of me, break me down by picking apart every little thing she knew I was afraid or self-conscious of, and actively sabotage my relationship with my father and siblings.\n\nShe would be up for days at a time, pass out standing up with her eyes glassed over and back hunched, and when she festered once again start moving and otherwise destroying everything in the house.\n\nThere were times where I'd leave and the house would be clean, and come home and it would look as though a pissed off tornado had run through the house i.e. broken glass, animal feces, dirty clothes, roaches, empty pill bottles, ground-up pill residue, and other miscellaneous things littering the house. On particularly bad nights she would hallucinate, and during those times it wouldn't be uncommon to find pools of her blood on the ground from running through glass.\n\nI remember being up for days at a time because her and my father would scream at each other for days at a time without stopping; actively trying to get me to pick one side or the other even if it meant barging into my room at 4 am to begin their screaming match where I could watch.\n\nShe manipulated me, abandoned me at times in the middle of nowhere when she'd meet up with her various sugar daddies (she was still with my dad during this), and never once apologized during her brief moments of mental clarity. If anything, she would blame everything but herself. In her mind she was infallible.\n\nMoney was always a big issue since she couldn't work in such a state. She sold some of her pills, yes, but ultimately those funds were used to buy more drugs anyway. Because of this, we were homeless frequently, without power and water for literally years at a time, and barely ever had any food. It was almost every night I went to sleep with the only thing I'd have eaten that day being a school lunch. On weekends, sometimes I didn't eat at all.\n\nThe rest of my family had no clue this was happening. During the summer when I was 16, my aunt whom I hadn't talked much with since I was a lot younger got in touch. She asked if I'd like to come to stay with them in Texas for a few weeks during the summer.\n\nOf course I said yes, and I was absolutely ecstatic. I didn't bother asking my parents since I'd be very much surprised if they even noticed I was gone so they were unaware. My aunt drove up all the way to Iowa and stayed the afternoon with us.\n\nMy parents seemed to lack the cognition to recognize she was even there out of the blue so they didn't come out of their room. As I stated before would happen frequently, when she arrived our house was fairly clean. We left for a bit to go get food, and when we returned the tornado had already passed.\n\nAs she told me when we were on our way to Texas: the thing that bothered her the most wasn't that our house had suddenly gone to hell, it was that I didn't even react to it. Instead, I tiptoed around the debris and started packing my things without a word.\n\nThis deeply unsettled her, and ultimately she asked me if I was safe where I lived. I said yes, as it was all I had ever known. She told me that what she saw frightened her, and she wanted me to come live with her in Texas. Thinking that she was joking, I brushed it off. After a few days down there though, I knew I had to do it. They showed me love, compassion, and care that I'd never even known existed prior to this and it shook me to my core.\n\nSo we decided, I was going to get emancipated from my parents and move in with them. Ultimately, this involved sitting in a courthouse across from my parents and their lawyer.\n\nThe judge asked why I wanted to leave, and I explained the above. I expressed the love and compassion I'd experienced for the first time in my life, and that I wanted to, for once, live in peace.\n\nTheir lawyer rebutted, \"To me, it seems as though you have no respect for your parents. Is it because of their financial situation? It looks as though you're attached to the perks of living in a family that makes a reasonable amount of money, and not that you want to leave because they're unfit parents.\"\n\nMy mother and father joined in, hooting and hollering actively trying to break me down as they have so many times before.\n\nI let him speak, I let them speak, and I held my tongue until it was my turn. They tried to goad me on, tried to break me as they had so many times before, but I wouldn't let them.\n\nFinally, the judge asked me to speak.\n\nWith as level a stare as I could muster, I looked at mother, my father, and their lawyer across from me and said \"If you're asking me if I have no respect for my parents, then you are correct. However, to say it's simply financially motivated is incorrect. I no longer have respect for them because they have-\"\n\nAs I was nearly finished, my mother, as she had so many times in the past began to squirm and scream at me from across the table. \"HE'S LYING THE LITTLE BASTARD IS JUS-\"\n\nUntil the Judge slammed his gavel down and cut the room; my mother staring up at him in complete and utter disbelief.\n\nI looked at her, keeping the tears I knew were right behind the corner at bay and said, \"For once in your life; for once in my life, behave as an adult. You can't stop me by simply yelling over me anymore, you have nothing to hold over me now. You can do nothing.\"\n\nAs I spoke, the judge motioned to his officer who moved towards my mother. Her expression still frozen in complete bewilderment as the officer aggressively told her to get up out of her chair and escorted her out of the room.\n\nThe judge looked to me, my aunt, my father, and his lawyer with one sweeping glance and then spoke.\n\n\"I am sorry that you have had to deal with this for so long young man. There's nothing more that you or anyone else needs to say. You deserve to live a normal life as a normal kid and it's obvious to me now that your parents are unfit to produce that kind of environment. You will go back to Texas with your Aunt, and we will regularly have our social workers in touch to check in on how you are doing. Make the most of this second chance, good luck young man. Adjourned.\"\n\nThough the bang of his gavel was the only noise that permeated the room, all I could hear was the ringing in my ears. My father and his lawyer were escorted out of the room and the tears I had held back all this time came gushing out like a tidal wave.\n\nIt's been 7 years since that day and I am happy to say that I've managed to grow up and become a well-adjusted adult. I have a great career, great friends, and an amazing girlfriend. I've been in therapy ever since we got back to Texas, and I no longer have trouble sleeping or terrible bouts of anxiety and depression as I used to.\n\nLife is good.\n\nTl;dr:\n\nMother is a narcissist with dissociative personality disorder addicted to opiates. Father kind of just went with the flow and didn't really do much. Aunt came down to take me to Texas, saw how shit everything was and asked me if I wanted to live with them. After some time I said yes, went to court against my parents under the pretense of emancipation, and got to stare them down and layout all the trauma, pain, and fear they've caused me. My mother was escorted out of the room when she tried to cut over me, and the judge sided with us and I was emancipated. Now I'm doing really well.",

I stopped to take a drink of water and she marched up to me going \"WE DON'T PAY YOU TO STAND AROUND DRINKING YOU KNOW!\" to which I calmly responded that I was thirsty, and needed a drink of water, and if she wanted to tell me I wasn't allowed to have a glass of water then good luck, but I'm pretty sure health and safety would have something to say about that. She huffed about not having had a break all day, which I ignored cos not my fucking problem, but internally I was put out about it, because it was totally fucking pointless to be such a twat about things.\n\nAbout 2 weeks in I get promoted to Supervisor as I was clearly extremely competent by their usual standards (I could walk and fart at the same time) but she also gets promoted to Floor Manager, so she continues to work her little power trips and try and lord it over me (and everyone else)\n\n4 weeks after that, I get another promotion to Floor Manager, and at this point we're equals, so she can't boss me around anymore. So instead, she tries a different tack, which is to try and lord it over me with her superior knowledge of processes, where to find stuff etc.\n\nMy response is to go (saccharine sweet) \"Oh thanks! That's so helpful, I mean you know how things work so much better than me, because you've been here 5 years, and I've only been here 6 weeks...\"\n\nShe had a face like a smacked arse.

We opened a sister location that I ran for about a year and a half before moving back to take over the old location.\n\nWhen I got back, a lot needed fixing but in particular there were 2 teenage employees that had been fired/suspended on numerous occasions. They were generally lazy, rude jackasses that shouldn\u2019t have been hired in the first place. Problem was, they both had aggressive helicopter moms that intimidated the manager into rescinding any punishments.\n\nOnce I came back, I took stock of our employees and had a long talk with the entire leadership team. I learned which employees caused which problems, who was unreliable, who had a regular habit of skipping shifts, texting on shift, etc. I fired about a half dozen that first week, including those two I mentioned. That night, both moms called my personal cell to scream at me (our numbers are listed in the online scheduling tool so employees can find shift covers more easily).  They demanded to know why I fired them, threatened to sue, have me arrested, accused me of discrimination (against their white middle-class sons), etc.\n\nI simply asked, \u201cIs your son over 18? Yes? So you\u2019re demanding I illegally release personal information regarding a former adult employee? Bye\u201d",

One deputy in particular came up time and time again for this kind of thing.\n\nI was asked to interview this deputy for a defense attorney. Deputy had some of the worse report writing skills I've ever seen. Riddled with grammar and spelling errors. Quite often, deputy wouldn't even include the reason he pulls people over in his reports. \n\nSo I go to interview the guy. As part of the process, there's a senior sheriff's rep there that basically is suppose to protect deputies from people like me and keep them from saying things they shouldn't. \n\nWe sit down and I pull out his report he wrote on the stop he made on my client's defendant.  I've already marked it up, English teacher style with a red pen and start with, \"I had some trouble understanding your report.\" I proceeded to go error by error for the purpose of \"clarifying\" the report.

He's not able to give a definitive response.\n\nAll the while, the sherriff's rep, whom I've worked with a lot and who I have seen be very vocal protecting deputies in interviews like this in the past, is silent. Ultimately, charges against client are dropped.\n\nMonths later, I'm driving through the area on the way home from camping, not speeding or breaking any traffic laws. I get pulled over by a deputy. It's the same deputy.

Kinda long.\n\nThe school he went to didnt allow backpacks, same as my own, so students had to carry around folders and binders to their classes. Well he had this cloth binder with a strap to go over his shoulder. Whats funny in retrospect is that I also had one of these in middle school and never got shit for them. \n\nAnyways he gets to school one day and its already a few months into the year. Hes been using his strapped binder with no issue, but the VP saw it and approached him. Conversation went like this:\n\nVP: \"You're not allowed to have backpacks, im going to have to take that from you until the end of the day.\"\n\nB: \"Its not a backpack, its a binder with a strap\"\n\nVP: \" Well it looks like a backpack and its on your back, do you have any folders?\"\n\nB: \"No, I don't this is all I have\"\n\nVP: \"Okay, youre just going to have to empty it then and carry your papers to class until the end of the day.\"\n\nBoyfriend wasnt having it, like any middleschooler he would just cram his papers in there and didnt want to carry a stack of papers around for the next 6 hours. He continues to disagree and she eventually takes him into the office. Conversation continues:\n\nVP: \"Can I take your papers out? You can have it back at the end of the day.\"\n\nB: \"No.\"\n\nVP: \"Well you're not leaving this office with it.\"\n\nB: \"Thats fine, I didn't want to go to class anyways.\"\n\nThis pisses her off and she says she'll be back once hes ready to have a polite discussion and leaves. Tries to sweat him out thinking he'd get so bored he'd rather just carry the papers to see his friends, but he is incredibly stubborn so that never happened. She eventually gets sick of him in there and tells him fine, just get a new binder after that day and he agrees gets up and leaves the office.\n\nHe never got a new binder.\n\nShe would see him later in the halls for the rest of the year telling him, \"You cant have that.\" And each time he would retort with,\n\n\"Are you going to take me to the office?\"\n\nHe had it for the rest of the year.",

Due to the bad economy and poor money management, my parents have moved into the spare room of the house my husband and I bought a year ago. Things are mostly smooth, tho I\u2019m not the closest to them for several reasons I won\u2019t go into here. \n\nThe other evening I was out gardening (because it\u2019s hot during the day and we have the luck of having a streetlight right next to our front yard, keeping it pretty well illuminated even after sundown, I mostly garden at night), and I thought I had gotten the hose twisted, as it kept getting stuck. This went on for a bit, when I realized that it wasn\u2019t stuck, but being pulled. I looked into the dim area just past the illumination of the street light and spied my father, crouched over and tugging the hose. Well I did the only reasonable thing to do, and I sprayed him. He yelled and ran inside with me chasing. \n\nOnce he got inside he made a face and goes \u201cYou can\u2019t get me now! I\u2019m inside!!\u201d In that father-to-daughter-don\u2019t-you-make-a-mess tone of voice.\n\nI readied my hose, looked him in the eye and said, \u201cIt\u2019s my house.\u201d And just fucking let loose with the hose. He was soaked. Worth cleaning up the mess for that moment of true fear in his eyes.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the appreciation! I\u2019m glad my silly story made your day better!!",

When oil was found in our area, we got so busy we could barely even think. Most of my team were pulling 12+ hour days 6 days a week and we were struggling to hire people quick enough.\n\nOne day, the CEO texted and said he hired an assistant manager for me, which was something I desperately needed. I was dirty as hell from my previous job and swung by the store to pick him up and take him to one of our sites where he would be doing paperwork. The moment he got in the truck, he immediately started talking shit. He started telling me about how everything we were doing is fucked up and the department manager &lt;my name&gt; was a total moron and he would have my job within a few months.\n\nI just sat and mostly listened. He obviously didn't know shit about my industry and every time he would say something wrong, I would try to politely correct him and he'd either backtrack or insist that I was trained wrong. When we got to the site OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEST TEXAS DESERT, he complained about the layer of dust on everything and \"ordered me\" to clean up the entire site.\n\nWhen I sat down at my desk, the guy continued to bitch my ear off about everything that was wrong and chastised me for sitting down at my desk when he told me to clean up the site. So I called for a taxi, filled out a notice of termination, and handed it to him. He looked absolutely shocked. Then he defiantly protested that only &lt;CEO&gt; could fire him. I said and &lt;my name&gt;, right? He sheepishly nodded. So I stuck my hand out for a handshake and introduced myself.\n\nI can teach anyone how to service equipment, but I don't have a clue how to teach someone to not be an asshole.",

I loved computers and they thought I'd make a good salesman, so my job was to stay in the computer department and sell computers; nothing else.\n\nWell, one of the shift managers didn't like that, and started insisted that I needed to go fold clothes for a while. As in, half my damn shift. I told him that the store manager had instructed me never to leave the technology department, but he insisted. This went on for several weeks.\n\nThe store manager showed up one weekend when both the power trippin shift manager and I were working. The store manager walks up with the shift manager close behind. Store manager slaps a stack of [greenbar paper](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;ei=iiBuX4PQEoqc5gL8gJLQCg&amp;q=greenbar+paper&amp;oq=greenbar+paper&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAAyBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeOgQIABBHOgsILhDHARCjAhCTAjoECAAQQzoECAAQCjoECC4QCjoICAAQFhAKEB5Q5g9Y2xRg2RVoAHACeACAAWyIAe8DkgEDNC4ymAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDvZnA4oTsAhUKjlkKHXyABKoQ4dUDCAw&amp;uact=5) (this was a while ago) down onto a shelf and points to some highlighted numbers.\n\nHe looks at the shift manager and says, \"Do you see this? This is our average technology sales numbers for the weeks you are on shift. See this number over here? This is our average technology sales numbers for weeks you are not. At this point, it would be more cost effective for me to simply fire you. What do you think of that solution?\"\n\nThe guy stammers and stutters like a toddler caught bullying another kid on the playground. Fortunately, the dude wasn't fired, but the store manager made it clear that when I was on shift, I was not to leave the technology department unless I was on break or there was a fire in the store. That shift manager never said another word to me.",

We were selling an extremely complex weldment (pressure tank that goes under the shitter) for 4.9K, out costs were 9.3K.  The owner took the bid \"to get in with this big company\". The owner legit said \"we'll make it up in volume\"... We weren't.\n\nAnyway the buyer for the larger company was a huge bitch and would regularly yell on phone calls. We sent them a letter that we would honor the last 5 tanks on the current PO at the same price (I didn't even want to do that) but after that they were going up to 10K per.\n\nShe drove down with her boss the next day and demanded an explanation and threatened to pull the business. I replied that we were losing 5K per tank and couldn't do it anymore. She demanded evidence which I already had pulled up and simply turned on the projector. I said, as you can see we cannot continue to make this part at such a huge loss and I don't think anyone can make it for the original price, so if you have to pull the business we understand. \"\n\nHer boss tripped over himself cutting her off and said they weren't pulling out and actually thanked us for honoring the current PO. I didn't have many run ins with her after that.",

Some kid (19-ish maybe) came in with a much shorter man who I later learned was his dad - for whatever reason (I forget what now) he wanted to cancel out of a contract he was partway through. Now I could already tell from the way the kid explained it in exasperated terms that he knew he couldn't cancel out of it, but his Dad wasn't taking his word for it and had dragged him in to try and 'sort it out' for him.\n\nThe contracts clearly state you can't cancel prematurely without paying off the rest of your dues, which I explained, and his father just went full Boomer Rage mode on me. Spitting, frothing, hurling vitriol - this guy clearly thought this was how you got things done. I stared him down, waited for him to finish, and repeated the contractual terms as stated. He hit me back with 'I'll report you for violating the Sale of Goods act!'\n\nSucks to be him because I had that bitch memorized. I made a point of it, infact, after the first few customers in my early days tried to bring it up to get their own way (*some chode on the internet had made posts about how you could sling the term around and usually scare retailers into doing what you want because 'they don't know it either' so it happened a lot even when there was absolutely no call for it*).\n\nI just looked at him and said 'Sure. Go ahead. You can even use our phone.' and pointed at the store phone right next to him. I knew he didn't have a leg to stand on and any trade commissioner listening to his claim would laugh him off the line.\n\nHe clearly had absolutely no idea how to proceed. After a moment of blank staring he just turned and stormed out with his son rolling his eyes so far back into his head he could probably see his own brain in embarrassment at his Dad's tantrum.",

Technically this shouldn't happen but it does. These patients can be a bit.... difficult.\n\nThis lady's appointment was at 8:55 before we even started at 9:00. She had her work up done when we actually clocked in and was all snooty about waiting 5 whole minutes (bearing in mind she's saving a fortune), then one of the nurses from the ward called and an actual NHS patient needed seen urgently so they were brought up and seen ahead of the \"private\" patient. Well this woman went mental, started shouting and bawling that she'd paid all this money and she demanded service.\n\nOur charge nurse went out, demanded to know who had taken money off of her, really drilled the patient to point to the person who had dared take money off of an NHS patient. Well the woman went beetroot, stuttered that she had paid the other hospital and the charge was like \"exactly, your money is no good here and doctor is being paid by the tax payer to see this emergency patient first so kindly sit down and be quiet or leave my department until you can be civil\".",

                            "comment": "I used to be a flight attendant. Passengers would get super shitty with us if there was even a tiny delay or issue, and accuse us of causing delays so that we could get paid more (most dumbass passengers don't realize that the flight crew don't get paid until the main cabin door is closed, that's what starts our time clock for getting paid). Oftentimes passengers had no problem berating a tiny young soft-spoken flight attendant, but what they don't realize is that the pilots don't put up with that shit. Almost all the pilots I worked for at the regional airline were awesome, they backed up their flight attendants unwaveringly. It was hilarous to see the look on the pax's face when the captain came out (if on the ground) and told the pax to gtfo. Like what do people expect, that you can just treat cabin crew like trash and no one's going to get upset? A lot of pilots and flight attendants date or are married, or are at the very least good friends, so of course they're not going to stand for mistreatment of cabin crew.\n\nThere are certainly exceptions to this, as I have flown with one captain who just didn't give a shit and I was all on my own. The majority were wonderful, many were ex-military and absolutely had everyone's back when a pax issue arose. I once had a pax complain about me personally because the coffee pots were broken (happened all the damn time on those shitty planes). It didn't amount to anything, but I was just astounded by her complaint, I was kind about it and apologetic, but for her to still complain about me was baffling. Flight attendants often take the brunt of pax abuse, and for very little pay. I got out of it after a few years because it was just too frustrating, the treatment was awful, and the hours were terrible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: To all the people telling me how cabin and flight crews are the worst people ever, and that I am literally satan for trying to make it a decent job, you are the problem. You are why people hate their jobs. Please do us all a favor and take the bus next time.",

No discussion, just yell.\n\nBut I realized at some point that he wouldn't yell at me if he had to look up while he was doing it.\n\nI don't remember what our last argument was about, I just remember that I'd sort of caught on at this point. So I'm in my room in front of the computer, Dad comes in and starts yelling at me. I eventually stand up and start yelling back. Dad makes an excuse to leave.\n\nDad comes back about a half hour later and starts yelling again, but at this point, it's all I can do to not just laugh. I know that the instant I stand up, the argument will end.\n\nIt actually wound up being really good for our relationship, because Dad realized that he actually had to make valid points, rather than just going into former drill sergeant mode.\n\nEDIT: Obligatory \"this blew up\" etc etc. It looks like I unintentionally may have hit a raw nerve for a lot of people, for which I apologize. And I don't think that I had it anywhere near as bad as some of the people who replied. \n\nAll I can say is that if you find yourself in a situation where you've got parents whose first response is intimidation or worse, look at how most people who responded eventually got out of the situation. Hang in there, it gets better, and you can find people who will help you if that's what is necessary.",

            "comment": "Probably watching a few Texas DPS Officers realize they couldn't shut down a whole airport.\n\nI was working as a flight instructor at small airport on a Saturday afternoon.  We had one plane that had an issue on takeoff and veered off the runway, it cartwheeled and totaled the airplane but fortunately the pilot was not serious injured.  I had a student who was next in line for takeoff when it happened, he called me from his phone as it happened.  I hopped in the airport car with one of the rampers and drove out to the plane with a radio to inform inbound planes to use the other runway (we had no control tower).  On the way to the runway I called the airport manager who drove to the airport and on his way he made a phone call to officially closed that runway.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later a metric fuckton of DPS officers showed up and immediately tried to close the whole airport, treating it like a giant crime scene.  They were carelessley driving around the airport like they owned the place, ignoring the planes that were moving around, and crossing our only open runway without regard to inbound traffic.  A mechanic and I tried to tell them to be careful and they got mad at us.  One of them told me they were \"locking it down\" a couple times, meaning the whole airport.  Now I was a broke ass flight instructor and I had a flight that afternoon that was ultimately going to help pay for me to eat that week.\n\nThe airport manager was a short stereotypical country guy, also former Navy.  He was not intimidated at all by the cops trying to close his airport.  When he showed up I was about to go out with a student who was preflighting for a cross-country.  There were about 5 cops in the lobby, me with my flight bag, the airport manager, and a mechanic.  One of the cops saw my flight bag and said \"I don't know why you have that or why he's out a the plane, you aren't going anywhere\", the moment he finished his sentence the airport manager said \"it's one runway that's closed, the airport is still open.  This pissed off the cops.\n\nI was about to head out the door, and one of the officers said he was driving out to the disabled plane.  Idky, the pilot had been gone for about an hour.  The mechanic said \"you need to be careful\" and the cop quickly retorted \"AND WHY THE HELL IS THAT?\" and he said \"because this is still an airport, and the first thing that hits you is going to be a propeller\" a few seconds later a plane took off as one of the cars was approaching the runway intersection ironing in that point.\n\nI walked out, and as I was hopping in the plane with my student the same cop came up to me and said \"you aren't going anywhere, we're locking this down!\"  I looked at the airport manager who followed all of us out to the ramp, he said \"have a nice flight AjaxBU!\" \n\nYou could see these cops just fuming that they didn't have the authority to close down an entire airport because one plane went off the runway.   The airport had two runways, where the disabled plane was located was probably a mile or so away from the open runway.  Why they were making a big fuss, I don't know.  The occupant was relatively uninjured, his wife was the worst thing he had to deal with that day, he told her he wasn't going to fly.\n\nWe had a good flight, and I got to eat dinner that week.",

There we have a control tower and FSS. Tower had the radios at that time of day. Pilot reports smoke in the cockpit, declares an emergency. He was \\~20 minutes out, and there's nowhere else to land, so he just continuing to come here. In the interim, emerg procedures put in place, Airport Firefighters are out in force. EMS is on standby, the town firehall comes out. And out comes captain jackass from the cops. BANGING on my door.  \n\"HI IM HERE TO TAKE CONTROL!\"   \n..... of what?  \n\"THE SITUATION, IM IN COMMAND.\"  \n... ok, well, tower has the radios right now, so theyre the ones dealing with the emergency.  \n\"THEN IM GOING UPSTAIRS TO TAKE CONTROL\"  \nAlrighty, you do that. He starts to head up the additional floors to the control tower. Thing is, tower's door, like mine, is locked and can only be opened with our keys or from the inside. I call upstairs and relay there's a cop coming \"to take control\" Naturally they do not let him in. There's really nothing he could possibly do except make noise and be in the way. Not long after he stomps back down and I hear him radio some nonsense about \"who do they think they are? IM IN COMMAND!\"",

He needed a replacement cable for his truck ASAP because the weekends were the big business days for him, bragging about the big money in people who leave their cars somewhere overnight because they're too drunk to drive home. He was shitty and rude the whole time we were on the phone. He demanded that the cable be cut and shipped immediately, sent next day air, saturday delivery (pretty expensive). I rushed his order, ran back to the warehouse to hand it to the manager myself to make sure it could jump in line and get cut before the next day air guy showed up. But we did it, rushed every part of it and got it shipped out in time. Every person involved prioritized this order to get it out to him on time.\n\n\nTow truck dude calls me back later that afternoon saying he got the truck working and no longer needs the cable. He asks to cancel the order and get a refund. I explain to him that because he had it cut to a specific length, if we were to take it back, there would be a restock fee (because we're not going to be able to resell it until someone needs that exact specific length). I also explain that I can't refund the shipping costs because the order has already been shipped the way he demanded it be sent out.\n\n\nDude loses his mind. Screaming at me telling me he's going to give the company terrible reviews everywhere and tell all his friends how we're all pieces of shit. There was literally nothing I could do for him. No amount of him being an asshole could uncut and unship that order.",

I hated every day going into that job but I needed the money. I was applying daily to my dream company in hopes that eventually I\u2019d be accepted. \n\nIn the meantime, every time I complained or mentioned something to my supervisor I was told to shut up and get on with it. \u201cHe was paying me too much to have opinions\u201d \n\nThree years after, we were a small office and the receptionist and assistant prop managers had quit. I finally got accepted into my dream company and happily put in my two week notice. \n\nIn desperation, he offered me more money, a higher position, better benefits (which were laughable). When I said no, he asked why. I have never felt more gleeful than the moment of when I said \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not paid to have opinions here.\u201d \n\nThat was a year ago and even now the look on his stupid old face gives me joy to this day.\n\nEdit: typo and uh, obligatory \u201cdidn\u2019t expect this to blow up\u201d but ....yeah. I\u2019m petty, what\u2019s new? lol thanks for the awards! \n\nTo those who mentioned: this was a very brief summarized version and yes, he did remember saying it to me. He told me I was being too sensitive and should take more money. I\u2019ve kept in touch with my (awesome) supervisor and in the year since I\u2019ve left, the position has yet to be filled. Everyone keeps quitting because they can\u2019t work with someone like him.\n\nSo, bahahaha.\n\nEdit 2: also, since a few people asked - the new job (a yearish in) is doing great and still to this day almost cry at the thought that I have benefits that include - *health insurance* and a boss that doesn\u2019t call me sweetie in a tone that indicates I can\u2019t chew gum and walk at the same time.",

Once they have enough money to leave my grandparents they moved to a small rented house.\n\nMy grandparents came for an unannounced visit and berate my dad for living in such a shanty house and how ungrateful he was for leaving their home.

My dad weren't having any of their bile anymore and kicked them out. \n\nThey stop talking until my grandfather was dying of leukimia.

It just so happened that we wanted to go to the same state for totally separate reasons, so we'd still be fairly close to each other. Well my parents hated our home state, so they decided to move with us so they could be close to us. \n\nWhen they left, about 75% of my dad's side of the family suddenly became very vicious towards them, thinking that my dad \"abandoned\" them for various reasons. It's still so bad that several of them refer to my mother as \"(dad's name)'s wife,\" despite obviously knowing her name (married ~20 years), because they blame her for \"taking him away from the family.\" If you couldn't tell, many of them are abusive and toxic people who only care about posturing for the rest of the family. \n\nI'm not sure if he ever told them that they were a large part of why he hated living in our home state, but I know that none of us has to deal with that toxic atmosphere anymore.",

They used their US power point deck and guided us through the rules &amp; regulations although directed by our local HR team to not do that: Here are some of the highlights:\n\n* We are not allowed to accept tickets for the Super Bowl. Utterly confusion - 90% of the people had never heard of the Super Bowl... a discussion about why we would want to watch that anyways, started. \n* We are not allowed to have relationship with anybody from a supplier or within the company. Uproar in the room:\n   * This is against the German constitution - what you do in your free time is non of their business. \n   * The discussion gets heated, everybody is discussing. The Americans on the line are very confused why.... \n   * The head of QA finally gets up and shouts \"If I love that woman, nobody will prevent me from dating her\". \n   * People signed the sheet that they participated and read and understood the presentation with \"with reservations\"\n   * People start discussing where to sign up for legal expenses insurance. \n\nHR refrained from that day from having mandatory global HR meetings. \n\nManagement tried a couple of other stuff - at will employment (against the law - everybody has a contract), cutting vacation (against the law), canceling bank holidays (against the law). Make people work on vacation days (guess what, against the law) and a couple more. \n\nIt was a prime example of cultural ignorance and incredible funny .....\n\nEdit: Wow - thank you for the awards and votes!!",

The father was....  An abusive prick.  He'd do things like make tomatoes every night for dinner knowing I absolutely hated them.  For a week.  Threw me in a pool when I was small and he knew I couldn't swim.  Classic 70s \"macho man\".  He literally tortured me every chance he'd get.  As an aside if you're a kid and your own mother doesn't give a shit how people treat you, it's pretty much open season.  \n\n\nAnyway, we went out to dinner one night.  Me, my Mom, her friends and their kids.  We were leaving the restaurant.  I don't remember what preceded it, but he said \"go ahead tough guy.  hit me as hard as you can right in the gut\" thinking I wouldn't do it because I was scared of him.  \n\n\nBut this was my moment and I knew it.  He was a small man, 5'6\".  I was at least as tall as him already.  And as he gave me his shit eating grin I pulled my fist back and fucking belted him in the gut with EVERY ounce of strength I could muster.  \n\n\nHe immediately doubled over.  He was FUCKING PISSED.  He tried to turn it around on me, but his wife shut him up instantly.  \"You told him to do it.  If you 'weren't ready' it's your fault, not his\".  \n\n\nOne of the most satisfying moments of my life.  And one of the last times I had to endure mr Tough Guy.",

However, we have a very desirable parking lot, and when people poach it we boot them. I love enforcing these, because I don't have to bite my tounge or apologize, as they aren't guests. My favorite one was this:\n\nGirl parks, and walks to neighbor hotel. Our gm happens to be in the lot, and says hey just fyi this is parking for x hotel, not z hotel. She proceeds to say fuck you, flips him off, and walks into neighbor hotel. \n\nGm calls me, and tells me. I giggle, grab the boot and slap it on her car. She comes back screaming and ranting. I tell her the cost is $200. She calls the police. The police ask \"is this a private lot?\" Yes. Ok then pay them. She refuses to pay and storms off. I get a call requesting the manager. I speak with them, its the girls mom. She is trying to say \"oh my daughter didn't know, she was for a job interview\" yada yada. I let her go on, and when she finally stops making excuses, I tell her that her daughter flipped off the gm, and there is no way the boot is coming off without payment. On top of that, i tell her when she pays she better not come in swearing or yelling, or the price goes up to 300. She hangs up, the daughter comes back and silently hands me 200, with a look of rage on her face. I've never been so internally giggly before.",

After several months of working (again at my first job) I finally had some money to spend on myself and decided to get a computer and a decent internet connection. At the time the best internet I could buy as part of a dish combo package. I bought a dish and brought it home to install on the house. During this time my dad was still living at home with us but he was hardly there and my parents had all but separated at that point. My dad promptly asked me what I was doing putting a dish on his house. I let him know that I pay the mortgage now and I make the decisions on what we do with the house.\n\nI was young but it was a very empowering moment for me.\n\nEdit: I didn't expect to see all this when I checked reddit again. I'll try to answer questions and things below. I like the jokes, probably a coping mechanism LOL!\n\nEdit 2: I see a lot of people talking about the deed and wanted to say something about that. I'm not sure which of my parent's names were on the deed but what I did know is that if I didn't pay it, it was going to foreclosure. We already had warnings and it wasn't the first time that had happened. I was young when this all happened and probably didn't even know what a deed or title was at that time. If I stopped paying, we no longer had a house. A constant argument from parents to their kids is that they pay for the roof over your head so you'll do what they tell you. They rarely say I own the deed, you do what I tell you.",

He was 17 years old and he did it during the hour or two he had between two jobs and school.

            "comment": "I was working a lab assistant shift(I'm a tech) receiving specimens and such, when a doctor phoned the lab. He was very upset that there was a test that was taking far too long in his opinion. I said okay, let's look at it, and asked what the test was. A fungal culture....\n\nA fungal culture takes at least two weeks to see if anything grows. The patient was in the ER. I politely told him the test was a send out and they generally take about about two weeks or longer depending on the fungus.\n\nHe got all huffy and asked why it took so long and is there a way to speed up the process since he wants to discharge the patient. I chuckled a little because this is a common problem with cultures, we're literally waiting for stuff to grow, we can't just make them grow faster. I told him we don't have magical wands that make fungus grow really fast.\n\nHe then asked for a lab tech because I was just a lab assistant. I then let him know I was in fact a lab tech with experience in microbiology and I can tell him from first hand experience that fungal cultures are some of the slowest cultures, right up there was AFBs, and assured him that if anything comes of it, we'll let ER know. \n\nHe didn't really like that, but said fine and hung up.",

We had two kids and I was a stay-at-home dad who did more than 90% of the parenting. One of the tactics I used with our kids was counting to three when they were behaving badly, and if they hadn't shaped up they would go to time out.\n\nCue forward to our divorce; she had manipulated the courts into granting her educational decision making for our kids and enrolled them in a school far from me and close to her. I began volunteering at the school to help in class to give me more time with our kids. She called to tell me that she had made the executive decision that I couldn't do that anymore. I told her she had no right to make that decision. She pulled out the education decision making card, and I told her that gave her no right to tell me what to do on my own time. She started ranting and wouldn't let it go; she had grown accustomed to me just giving in and I wasn't doing that anymore.\n\nShe started getting really angry and yelling. Without even thinking about it, I just said, \"One...\"\n\nShe paused for a moment and then started into it again. I said, \"Two...\"\n\nBy that point she got what I was doing I think, because she took a breath and started a bit more calmly, but then she got to yelling again and I said, \"Three.\" And I hung up the phone.\n\nShe immediately called me back and I ignored the call. She kept trying and I kept ignoring it. Ten minutes later I called her back and we started talking again. She didn't yell, and of course I kept volunteering at my kids' school because I'm a good dad, dammit.",

I was west of town and a vehicle rolled halfway between where I was and the fire hall. So I called the responding people and said I\u2019ll meet you there. \n\nIt was a single vehicle that rolled and they were all immigrants from the Pakistan/Afghanistan region. Before I got there, a doctor from the same region had stopped to lend a hand. She was from the similar region as those involved in the crash and I had assumed she was the eighth person in the van. She started to try to order me around and tell me I only needed to know certain information about the patient she was with. It went something like this. Dr: \u201cShe has midline neck pain and sore ribs.\u201d Me: \u201cOkay, and crepitus or deformity to the.....\u201d Dr: \u201cThat\u2019s all you need to know!\u201d Me: \u201cUhhh wha?\u201d Dr: \u201cI am a doctor and that\u2019s all you need to know!\u201d That\u2019s when I figured maybe I should ask what kind of doctor, in case this is some whackadoo who just claims to be a doctor like we\u2019ve had happen before. \n\nShe tells me she\u2019s a podiatrist. I gave her my best look of trying to be nice but their feet are fine right now. When doctors or nurses show up on scene, they ultimately can trump EMS. But they have to actually do the work and sign off as having taken patient control. As soon as I asked her to sign the paperwork and ride with us to the hospital she realized she was out of her knowledge area and disappeared.",

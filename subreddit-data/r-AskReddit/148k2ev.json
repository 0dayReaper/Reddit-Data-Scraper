He said when you walk into a grocery store , walk the perimeter for your food choices , stay away from the center aisles . Pretty simple really, most stores in the US start with fresh fruits and veggies, meats around the back perimeter, then around to dairy . If you stay in that perimeter loop, you\u2019re good to go. He said you shouldn\u2019t be eating anything that has a shelf life of more than a week .",

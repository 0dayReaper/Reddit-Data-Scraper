It looked like a giant peice of...liver maybe? Just a pile of smooth red meat...no blood around. And it was wrapped up in a t shirt, with some coins scattered around it. We called our rangers to go check it out, and one of them was pretty sure it was a placenta. The weird part is, you have to check in thru a front desk. So someone either snuck a placenta/liver in or gave live birth/removed an organ on our trails. We never got an answer on what the pile of meat was, how it got there, or why.",

Once my coworker and I were working in a more urban environment and came across what we initially thought was a body - which of course triggered \"Oh shit!!\" from us - but it ended up being a firefighter's dummy that had fallen down a hill. We felt pretty dumb.\n\nOther notable things include a small grave in the middle of nowhere for someone's dog (pretty sad), and a stuffed rabbit with shotgun shells placed where its eyes should be, a mannequin very purposely placed in a chair in the middle of the woods, and lots of little random alters.\n\nI also did work in Myrtle Beach (what a hell hole) and accidentally walked into an inhabited homeless camp. I was peering into a stormwater grate when I looked up and saw a homeless person standing in his shelter staring at us and saying nothing. I felt like I was trespassing so we quietly left.",

            "comment": "I used to work in a ship and we're usually gone 3 to 10 months at a time. I worked night shift so this meant I would sleep in the sleeping quarters during day time with either just me or a handfull of other crew members where usually there'd be 20 to 30 of us in there. It wasn't so bad. Actually I really liked because it's a lot more peaceful sleelimg during the day. You don't hear anybody else snoring or someones footsteps because they have to piss or something like that. All you can hear is the light creak of the walls and the floors of the ship and all you can feel is the sway of it on the ocean. A bit haunting and creepy of you really think about it but I like it. \n\nAll that ended when there was a short period of time was literally only 2 of us in there or at least that's what I thought. I started hearing light taps across the room. At  first they were light taps. Then it would get a bit faster. Sometimes it'll get a bit louder. I'd ignore it if it wasn't so utterly annoying. I look at where the other guys is sleeping and he seems to be fast asleep accompanied by his light snoring. 2nd day, there it goes again. I tried to follow the sound but for some reason it bounced around the room like an echo. Eventually it comes to an abrupt halt. So I try to sleep it off. During work at night I tried to ask my mate about it but he said he was too tired to even notice. I guess I'm alone on this pursuit. \n\n3rd day I take my pursuit one step futher by not sleeping right away. I'd be fully awake when it starts so I'll have a better chance of discovering the source. There it goes again. This time I go from one empty rack to the next until finally it was loud as fuck, tapping in progress. My heart was thumping like a jackhammer. I pulled the curtain to the side. There laid the biggest dude I've ever seen on the ship holding his dick mid stroke. You have no idea the speech I prepared for this guy, in my head, for keeping me up for several days but at that exact moment I had no idea what to say. Of course I gave out a small yalp which didn't help the situation. I never thought I'd be locking eyes with another dude while he's gripping his dong when I began this honorable pursuit. \n\nWith the current situation I mustered my best attempt at displaying my annoyance. It somehow came out as an apology followed by \"I keep hearing tapping noises\". He hadn't said anything yet but at that exact moment, I realized that his elbow that which belong to the fapping arm is resting right on the wall probably banging on it over and over and over. I didn't wait for a reply. I nodded my head, kind of rolled my eye and walked away. It will never be easy trying to avoid a big guy like him everyday  in the same sleeping quarters.",

            "comment": "I work on North sea oil rigs on an ad-hoc basis (off the coast of Scotland) .\n\nWouldn't say anything was particularly paranormal creepy but it can be very unsettling/weird place. \n\nFog can come rolling in out of nowhere and other rigs you can see off the sides can disappear in front of your eyes. Sometimes you can't see the walkways 6ft in front of you or if you're walking over grating you can't see the sea below your feet (about 60m down from feck to sea) but you can hear it, all be it muffled. The fog can roll in over the course of a few minutes too so a perfectly clear day becomes pea soup.\n\nYou can also feel the rig moving/swaying on high winds /rough seas. Even though it's a fixed leg Platform. Very unnerving to feel your office swaying when it shouldn't be.\n\nMy last trip was my first ever Nightshift and I found it particularly unsettling as you've got the background noise of the plant but I walked around the whole rig without seeing another living soul for the whole shift (usually there are about 130 people on board although smaller rigs have smaller headcounts) . \n\nUsually once a trip im hit by this awareness that you are just very isolated and in the middle of no where (most rigs I've worked on are an hour's chopper ride from land). So if things go wrong it can escalate very quickly.",

            "comment": "During college that was located away from major cities, the woods were all around us. That being said, there was a highly rated trail, the Loyalsock Trail, which was about an hour drive from the university. I invited a friend to come with me as he had never been on an extended backpacking trip. A 50+ mile trail that we intended to backpack over the four day weekend. I am an Eagle Scout who has spent countless hours in the woods and went on backpacking trips consistently throughout my college experience. As many have said before me, you get used to the minor \u201cspooky\u201d things happening; Coyote howls, raccoons in the middle of the night, even the occasional unknown noise. The scariest thing to find in the woods, however, are people.\n\nWe were about 20 miles into the trail and, being Pennsylvania where the underbrush and trees line the trails pretty densely, I always walk about 100 meters off of the trail to reduce the chances of me disturbing people/people disturbing me (especially in the early morning when I choose to sleep in). Following that same strategy, my friend and I go out of our way to be in this amazing spot a good ways off of the trail where it would even be difficult to see our flashlights from the trail. This spot was on a peninsula where a creek met a river, meaning there was only one way into our camp and only one way out. We start a fire, cook our food, and drink some (but not enough to get either of us drunk). We put the fire out about midnight and head in to our individual tents. All is quite. It is the fall semester, so leaves are on the ground, the moon is brightly shining through the bare trees, and the air is cool. The only noise is the occasional time when I would hear my friend turn over in his sleep. Then, I hear the voices...\n\nThe voices sounded very close for being on the trail 100+ meters away. I check my watch; 3am. Who hikes at 3am? We are 20 miles in. I slowly get out of my sleeping bag, slowly unzip my tent, only to see my friend peaking out of his tent in the exact same fashion. He quickly moves his finger over his mouth in an exaggerated \u201chush\u201d signal, then used the same hand to frantically motion towards the way of the trail. Then we see them. Four adults, three men and one woman, walking directly towards our camp. No lights illuminating their path; They are walking silently at this point. Only one of them has a backpack; An impossibility for the long hike they were 1/3 of the way through. Being a long trip, you bring wood cutting supplies to chop branches into smaller branches to burn; For me, this was a survival knife. Grabbing the knife, believing it is my only way of defending myself, I am more disheveled than I ever have been, especially knowing that a knife is barely defense at all. These people walk into our site, sit down by our extinguished fire pit, and just sit there for what felt like an eternity. \n\nMy friend speaks up and asks what they are doing in our campsite. Without answering the question, they ask if we have any food. Having packed as lightly as possible for the long trip. We had only a few extra Mountain House, MRE-style meals. I grab one out of my bag and toss it to one of the men. In rapid succession, I ask why they aren\u2019t using a light, if they need help finding the trail, and why they are hiking so late. They respond with the following:\n\n1) \u201cWe don\u2019t use lights\u201d\n2) \u201cWe know where the trail is\u201d\n3) \u201cIt is better to hike late at night\u201d\n\nUnnerved at this point, my friend asks them to leave. They respond by asking if we want to light the fire and hangout for a bit. No we do not. They grab their bag, get up, and leave without speaking another word. We watch them leave and take shifts making sure that they didn\u2019t come back. Needless to say, we both got very little sleep that night. When the sun rose the next morning, we finally got \u201creal\u201d sleep. By the afternoon, when we woke up, it all felt like a weird dream of sorts. The only evidence was a fuzzy cap that they must have dropped that I have to this day.\n\nI have never had something as weird/spooky as that happen in the woods and hope to never have it happen again. In the eight years since that trip, I haven\u2019t been back to the Loyalsock Trail.",

We went to look at it and couldnt find an entrance but the spacing was obvious there was an extra room. It might not sound so creepy unless youve been in these shipyards where two things are known to happen: stowaways, although i doubt it in this case, but also hundreds of workers at any given time following orders blindly. So we confirmed that the room had all six sides, yet not a single weld on the outside. There is only one way this couldve happened and im sure youre starting to get it now. They must have welded from the inside for this room and then realized they had no way out upon completion if the gasses didnt kill them first. \n\nIts extremely heavy around that room. People say they hear things. I have definitely. This isnt some old ship either. I rode this ship from China to Amsterdam after completion and then the maiden voyage to America. I guess it happens quick",

                            "comment": "Essentially when youre building a ship. All projects are almost happening at the same time. Its not always a ground up situation. People will be welding crane masts while others are under it welding the floor beneath. There are literally hundreds of people all working on it at the same time. This room had no outer welds whatsoever. Which means the welds are from the inside. The theory is that they all welded the different pieces together without realizing they werent leaving themselves an opening because they all have different jobs and typically dont collaborate. Because the room is sealed on all six sides to our knowledge. I doubt it was all six sides at once, it wouldve been the last two sides and them thinking the other was leaving an opening. I hope that explains it. \n\nI said in an earlier comment theres a possibility that theres an opening between the room and hull. Because it does look sealed at the bottom and top but due to the size of the ship, i cant rule out it absolutely went all the way to the hull just from looking at the decks above and below. The double bottom is inspected every so often by a third engineer. Its not a place people go because theres not much of a reason. Ive only been just to see what its like so i never thought about connecting the two.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a little late to this thread but I hope this doesn\u2019t get buried because this story still haunts me. \nI worked as the county historic preservationist in southern Appalachia, working on the buildings and properties the county owned. One of the \u201cbenefits\u201d included with my job was living on-site at one of the historic properties. The historic house was an imposing brick mansion built in the 1810s and I lived in a small caretakers house about 20 feet away. This was in the backwoods, so to deter trespassing and vandalism the county had built an 8 foot tall fence around the entire 5 acre parcel and put barbed wire on top of the fence. I mention this all just to show it was basically impossible for anyone, or anything, to jump or climb over the fencing and onto the property. \n\nOne night, after working late at another property, I pulled up to my entrance gate, let myself in, locked it behind me and then drove the 100 yards down the gravel road to my house. There were no lights on the property so I could only see by my headlights. \n\nAs I turned my car around the corner of one of the outbuildings and parked it, my lights shown on a thing that I still have a hard time describing effectively. It was the size of a deer, but with long spindly legs and long shaggy hair. Almost like a taller Maned Wolf, if you\u2019ve ever seen pictures of one of those. That alone shook me as there was no way something of that size should\u2019ve been able to get through, or over my fencing. \n\nWhat follows is absolutely true: I got out of my car to get a better look at what the hell the thing was and as I opened the door and got out, the thing took off running away: not on four legs, but on two! I literally watched this thing raise it\u2019s back up, stand at full height on its back legs and sprint away. \n\nI absolutely freaked out at that point, grabbed my maglight and my shotgun from inside and tried to find the thing again. There was no trace. No tracks or anything; I have no idea how it got in OR out of my property. \n\nI didn\u2019t sleep at all that night, just sat on my couch with my shotgun watching my front door, hoping that whatever I saw didn\u2019t come back and burst in. I cannot explain what the hell I saw that night but it still raises the hair on my neck every time I think about it.",

I knew the national park my house backed onto like the back of my hand. I knew from the topography where I was at all times. Both my parents were ex-military and had a sort of \"hands off.\" Trusting me even as young as 12 to venture off on my own into the wilderness.\n\nSo I could just pack a lunch, and my sister and neighborhood friend would come with, we'd head off early in the morning, returning just before sunset usually.\n\nOnce, when I, the oldest, was about 14, we had been following creek beds and bashing over heavily forested hills towards an area I'd never been. \n\nWe came down a hill, through a gully full of ferns and followed a dry creekbed for another hour, the sides of the creek became steep and rocky, before long we were passing through a gorge.\n\nAs we emerged from the gorge, we noticed what looked like a dwelling. Being idiot kids we wanted to see what was up. It looked abandoned at first. But as we got closer we saw that tarps had been affixed to the ramshackle structure. Chicken-wire surrounded what looked like a pen just outside. \n\nAs my eyes traveled across it, I suddenly caught another pair of eyes looking directly back at me. A rottweiler. We started slowly edging back away from the property, but it was too late. The dog started going nuts and, worried that it was coming after us, or at least alerting the person/s living in the hut, we bolted.\n\nI went back to the area a few times, but not too close to the abode itself and found discarded bones from small game and other bits and pieces, spent .22 casings and such. \n\nAs an adult and knowing the area, it's very likely we stumbled across either a homeless person camping out. Or a meth lab. As the area, as I would find out as an adult, was absolutely riddled with meth labs.",

Well, one morning after being there, I get a call from school security and they want me to come in. When I get there I see a police car too. Uh oh, I think. They ask me a few questions like \u201cdid you notice anything out of the ordinary or strange while you were here last night?\u201d No, I hadn\u2019t (usually have headphones in). Security then shows me camera footage of someone breaking into one of the classrooms WHILE I WAS RIDING THE ZAMBONI not far away. I was there for another two hours. Nothing was stolen. But the worst part was they didn\u2019t have footage of the person leaving, they didn\u2019t go out the way they came in, and police had to sweep the entire school. Never did find out what happened with that one.",

Not quite as scary as being alone, though. \n\nI was a tutor for an elementary school where I would pull out advanced reads and conduct a book club of sorts to encourage kiddos that were ahead of their classmates to still find interest in reading, lol.\n\nThis was around the time when school shootings were getting really rampant in the US a couple years ago. So there I am, alone with five third graders joking around and having book club in the empty classroom I was allowed to use. All of a sudden, an alarm goes off and an announcement is made that there is an active shooter on campus and we must lock our doors and conduct active shooter protocol. \n\nI lose my fucking mind. I usher the students into a little coat closet out of view of the door, lock the door, and flick off the lights. To make it worse, me being a stupid college student at the time, I never had my phone charged. I send as many texts to loved ones as I can, trying not to alarm them but letting them know I love them and something is happening at work before my phone dies.\n\nThe students are also afraid and about thirty minutes passes. I hear footsteps outside of the door and quite literally stop breathing but they go past. I don\u2019t hear any shots or anything. Another thirty minutes pass and I realize that I should call the front office to see if they have any updates (my brain goes stupid during emergencies, apparently. I forgot that classrooms have built in phones during my panic). They answer like nothing is wrong and I say something like\u201d hi I\u2019m a tutor here and have five students with me in xyz room. Is it safe to come out? Are the police here?\u201d The woman doesn\u2019t answer for a little and dead ass says \u201coh did we not make an all clear announcement? The drill is over.\u201d\n\nI was so close to tears and just hung up, lol. Then an announcement is made that the drill is over. Nobody thought it would be important to let an outside school contractor know about a drill that very well could have been real!!! I swear I could have pissed myself.",

Our room was an old home ec room so it was huge and open and we weren't able to lock the doors. I hid my kid in a closet for 15 minutes. This school doesn't so drills. The whole time I was there, they literally never had any drills. It turned out there was a shooting outside the school and they used the wrong code.

I cant quite hear it cause the pump is too loud.  \n\nI search around a couple times and see nothing.  I get in the truck and take off drive past the front of the sideboom to see a cougar sitting on top of a dirt pile 15 feet away.  The damned thing was just watching me there and probably could have ended me without me even realizing it.  I've never seen a cougar in the wild before and its hard to understand just how big they are and how powerful until you see one up close.  That thing leaped off the 6 ft pile and probably didnt touch ground for 15-20 ft.  \n\nIts terrifying to think something so big and powerful could just be sitting there deciding if they want to make you dinner",

The cougars (well...and moose) scare me more than anything else out here. My cougar story:\n\nMy husband and I were out hiking an old hunting trail, quite far into the park, with our dog. The dog was super big, a Rottweiler/Irish wolfhound, and very well trained (he sadly passed away at a fairly young age). We'd been out hiking for about 2 hours and stopped for a rest on a fallen log. We'd been sitting for just a few minutes when suddenly the dog starts, sits up and stares intently into the dense brush bordering the path. After a minute, he jumps up and starts growling intensely, hackles up, standing between us and the brush. We don't see a thing, but we know there's cougars in the area, and not much else is so quiet and hidden out there, so we pack up and start hiking back. The dog is super relieved we're leaving and walks alongside us, checking behind us every so often. We hike back for 10 minutes or so and the dog stops again, staring behind us and starts growling loudly again. We have bear spray, but no gun, and we figure the cougar is following us now. So we keep hiking back, adrenaline high, bear spray out. It goes like that for roughly an hour, hike for awhile, dog watching our back and occasionally stopping to snarl/growl at whatever he senses that we don't see. The dog stayed tense the rest of the way back and kept checking over our shoulders, but the last half of the hike back home he didn't growl at anything else at least. Still scared the crap out of us both and we were super grateful that the dog stuck to us (instead of running off to chase off the cougar, which ends in them being eaten), but was big and aggressive enough to keep the cougar at bay.",

Heard a lot of weird noises like mountain lions screaming, deer snorting, what sounded like owls fighting. Woke up one morning to find two bull moose sleeping 20 yards behind my tent. All of this was \"part of the job\" until one night a truck was driving towards us when we were on a BLM square in the southwestern part of the state. The truck was going overland, no road and was slowly driving at us. It stopped about 100 yards away, turned off the lights and we could see a person get out. They walked a full circle around us at ~100yards away, got back in the truck and turned around. This was after dark and this shadowy figure did a complete circle around us. You could hear them walking through the sage brush and I'm sure they could hear us talking. We packed up after that and drove to a hotel an hour away. \n\nI called the office and told them I was taking a gun when we went back out. Didnt like having the bear mace as our only defense.\n\nEdit: BLM stands for Bureau of Land Management",

Once my friend actually had to kill a juvenile cougar because he crept up and stole his dog right from beside him. He didn't notice til it was already a few feet away because the dog whimpered and screeched. He chased after the cougar and it fumbled the dog a bit, slowing it down enough to be grabbed by the body. He said he tried everything from jabbing its neck to hitting its head and it just wouldn't budge or let the dog go. He managed to grab a 2x4 and repeatedly bludgeon its neck until it stopped moving.\n\nThe dog survived with wounds and broken jaw, but just after being free the dog ran home and he followed after her. The neighbours were all shouting at him calling him a dog beater, and he had literally just fought and won against a cougar...\n\nIt turns out a whole family of desperate cougars were living under the balcony of a residential preschool, which was right in front of where he was fighting the cougar. The whole family of cougs were probably watching it all happen....\n\n\nThe other story is short and sad. My friend left him cat on a leash while he went to work and returned only to not be able to find her. Eventually after tons of searching he found his cat's head behind his house in the forest.",

            "comment": "Spent a summer doing conservation work out in the absolute middle of nowhere in Wyoming. Was part of a crew that would spend two weeks camping in remote places to do manual labor in places machines couldn't get to. \n\nFor this story, we were building new hiking/biking trails in the back portion of a designated wilderness area in a high altitude desert. This means that the nearest civilization was a 2 hour car ride to a town of 41 people in a sandy soil area where tracks last forever.\n\nIt was the middle of our stint during the early part of the night where everyone else had gone to bed but I stayed up to read, so maybe 11:30 or so. Still pitch black outside, clouds had covered stars. so my head lamp was probably the only light on in a 40 mile radius. \n\nSuddenly I hear footsteps walking around our camp and head towards the tents from where I was in the community tent. That sound immediately put me on edge as I felt the hair on my arms raise and my adrenaline spike. I recall thinking to myself that two things are very wrong since the person was not using a light to see and the footsteps were not coming towards me from the tents, rather it was the opposite.\n\nWithin the four seconds it took me to drop my book, get up, and turn the corner of the tent to cast my light on the sleeping tents, the sound had stopped but I saw tracks in dirt before me. Looked like they came from one end of camp, looked into my tent, walked through the sleeping tents and kept going out of camp again.\n\nI don't know if I was making too much noise or not by walking around, but the rest of my crew ended up waking up and asking me what was going on from inside their tents. After explaining what I found, they all got up to look at the boot prints in the dirt. They were damn near perfect copies of my own boots except for one small thing, I had a rock stuck in my treads that messed up the symmetry. (I was wearing fairly common work boots, except I also happen to wear US size 15 double wide boots, so there was no way in hell this was one of the other crew members)\n\nI don't think any of us slept much that night. Never saw or heard anything more after that night. A light rain removed the tracks a couple days later, but I do remember none of us were willing to step on the prints themselves and choose to step over them like cracks in the sidewalk.",

            "comment": "I used to own a horse boarding and training farm with about 45 acres surrounded by woods. I used to spend the night there quite a bit, because I had to start chores early in the morning so if I stayed too late it wasn't worth it to drive home. One night at about midnight my dog started to bristle up and growl at the door of the office I slept in, and then my ipod, which I kept on a speaker in the middle of the barn, started blasting out Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire at full volume, which I definitely hadn't left it on. Let me tell you, that song is fucking freaky as shit in the middle of the night. Like shit your pants freaky. \n\nMy dog was full on growling and barking at the door, so I cracked it and let him run out, figuring that if someone were in or around the barn he'd get them (anyone there would have been trespassing at that time of night). After a few minutes I went out of the office into the barn aisle (with a bat) to turn off the creepy ass music. The light I usually kept on so I could see around was off, so it was pitch dark in most of the barn. My dog was just staring out the barn door (which I kept open in the summer to keep the horses cooler) with his hair bristled but wasn't leaving the barn, which he was allowed to do. I wrote it off as creepy as fuck but ultimately just \"one of those things\", you know, like it's weird and I can't explain it, but there's got to be an explanation I'm just not privy to.\n\nBut the real scary part is that my property shared a private gate in back with the property closest to mine, which had a gate at the back. Most of my property was fenced because of the horses, and the property next to mine was like dozens of acres fenced with a chain link fence, which if you know anything about rural fencing is NOT DONE. Anyways we found out later that the owner of the adjoining property was **Todd Kohlhepp** the South Carolina serial killer. He had a woman chained up like a dog on his property who he and his friends would rape and walk around the property on a leash. He also had some bodies of people he killed buried on his property. \n\nHe was doing all that stuff while I lived next to him. In fact I used to ride on his property but would always turn around if I heard machinery (in retrospect probably burying bodies) or got the creeps (like something would tell me to \"turn around and go home\"). I was probably one of the few, if not only, person besides his friends who were raping the woman, to go on his property while all that was going on. \n\nTodd Kohlhepp: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Kohlhepp",

            "comment": "I spent several seasons working at a remote field camp in Antarctica...over 1000 km from the main station in McMurdo. Every once in a while, a Skua bird or Antarctic Tern would accidentally end up following one of the small planes (Twin Otter) out to our camp. Once there though, they'd basically be stranded with no way to get back to the coast. I'd get out of my tent some mornings and see a lonely Tern circling overhead, knowing it was a dead bird flying. It was quite creepy. \n\nAlong these lines, when birds (or seals) do die down there, it's so cold and dry, that their bodies don't decay either. They essentially mummify. Outside McMurdo at Scott's Discovery Hut, there is still a perfectly preserved seal carcass from 1912 sitting by the entrance of the hut.\n\nEdit: Dang...this kind of blew up. Been working all day and just getting back on now. The short answers to some of your questions are:\n\n- I think it's that the birds more follow the contrails than the planes themselves but I could be wrong. I just know from the various camp managers and other scientists down there (particularly biologists) that told me once a Tern or Skua gets that far away from the coast, they're basically toast due to lack of food and temps.\n\n- I have some old pics from my 2008-2010 deployments...but only as partial albums in an old flickr account. Knock yourselves out if you really want. Any album with WAIS in the name was from antarctica. https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnfegy/albums\n\n- How did I get down there? I was in graduate school studying glaciology, paleoclimatology, and in some sense, geophysics. I deployed as part of a big NSF grant to extract and study an ice core record. I actually went back in 2015 to South Pole to work on that core as well. Last year, I deployed on a research ship off the coast of West Antarctica as part of a ocean sediment core team...which was also quite interesting. You can get down there as a tourist as well (see ALE expeditions), but it'll cost you over 10k.\n\n- The most amazing place I visited was the area around Union Glacier to work on remote seismic and GPS stations. We flew all over to tiny exposed rocks in the middle of nowhere. It was quite surreal. Most of those pics are here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnfegy/albums/72157628321851875\n\n- I watched the \"Thing\" at least once a season (as is tradition).\n\n- My little claim-to-fame factoid is that technically I was the first person to reach the south pole in 2016 (I went out to the marker at midnight on dec 31st, 2015). Which also brings up the somewhat eerie notion that while at the south pole, literally every person alive or dead is north of you (except for maybe astronauts on the ISS?)\n\n- While at south pole, I successfully completed the first every 50-mile running ultramarathon in -40C temps...it was insanely stupid...but still kind of fun (see also here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGy_U8AebT8)\n\n- What's my job now? I still do research, but now I mostly teach at a university and work with grad students (see here: https://johnfegy.weebly.com)\n\n- did i miss anything?",

            "comment": "I was the creepy occurrence.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live on a ranch off of a quite dirt road.  Our distant neighbors (nearest house is about 1 mile away as the crow flies) have had issues with people stealing things out of their out-buildings and storage sheds in the area.  It was also late in the year, so it was starting to get dark around 6PM.  So as a result every time I would see headlights go down our road I would watch to make sure they weren't stopping on the property. \n\nOne evening I see a vehicle going very slowly down the road and come to a stop at the end of our driveway (about 120 yards from our front porch).  The vehicle is parked right in front of a 60's pickup I have parked, so I think whoever it is might be looking to steal it, or just looking over the property.  Whatever the case, I decide to put on a black coat and grab my rifle to go investigate.  It's dark out, so I stay out of the headlights of the vehicle so I can get close.  I can tell it is a white van, but I don't see anything else distinguishing about the van.  When I'm about 50 yards away the van backs up and turns into our driveway.  I freeze as the headlights wash across me standing in the middle of my driveway....and I see the reflective Fedex logos on the side of the van.\n\nNeedless to say the Fedex driver probably shit his pants as he suddenly sees a dark figure standing in the middle of a field, in the dark, holding a rifle.  Surprisingly after I try to give a friendly wave and smile he continues up the driveway to the house, and I get to explain the situation and we both have a laugh.  \n\nSo that's how I got to be the creepy guy in some Fedex delivery driver's story.",

            "comment": "I spent some time in the peat swamp forests of Borneo studying wild orangutan. We would go into the forest very early around 4 am. One morning there was a clouded leopard on the trail we used to enter the forest. It was just crouched there watching us. We shouted, tried to act big, one of the indigenous people we worked with even took out his slingshot and shot rocks at it (he missed on purpose just trying to scare it off). It stayed there for a good 5 minutes watching us before it slowly walked into the thick brush off the cleared trail. When we walked by I shined my light to where it had walked to and could clearly see a pair of reflective eyes only 3 meters away crouched watching us pass. Creepy but  also incredibly cool to see one in person for how critically endangered they are\n\nEdit: since I\u2019ve got quite a few requests for pictures I just posted a picture I took of a baby orangutan named Merkur\n\nEdit: These were WILD orangutans. We tried our best to keep our distance and NEVER tried to touch them. The goal was to observe them while trying not to effect their natural behavior. That being said over my year there I did get charged by one of the big dominant males in the area on three separate occasions which is its own terrifying story to tell another time. He never did touch me but sure scared the hell out of me and made me run \n\nEdit: \nSince a lot of people are asking. I am American who studied biology in college. How I got this job was a combination of luck and preparation. I worked my butt off in college and had field experience and then we had a guest speaker one day who is a big name in orangutan conservation research talk to us. I had always wanted to go to Borneo and got to speak with her after the talk and discovered that she needed two students to go do research for a year after graduation. She interviewed me and the rest was history. I do want to mention to anyone considering this field that it is HARD WORK. We would wake up at 3:30 am, spent 14-15 hours in a swamp forest following wild orangutans taking data every two minutes. It was hot, humid and TONS of mosquitoes. No communication to the outside world except on our days off where we could take a 15 minute walk to a tree stand where we could sometimes  get one bar of service to send a few whatsapp messages to family. The camp was only 15ish people and we would spend 2-4 months there at a time before going back to the city (palangkaraya) to bring back samples. The location of this research was in Central Kalimantan Borneo. That all being said it was an amazing experience of course, saw animals and insects that just blew my minds and I miss it all the time.

An hour or so in, there was 6 of us on top, nearly the entire crew now. A big white spot light shines at us. We were near land, but where the spotlight was, was above the water and it wasn't low enough to be on a ship, this was very high up. It shined on us for about 15-20 seconds. Once the light turned off we looked to see what it was. Saw nothing; no trace of an aircraft or anything. \n\nCouple minutes go by and the same light shined on us, this time it was on the other side of our vessel, above mountains. Still, unable to see what it was. We all saw it, we all have never seen any aircrafts hovering above these waters, especially at 2am. \n\nWe don't know what it was. We think it might have been some sort of silenced aircraft the military was probably doing drills or something. But anyways, that was one of the weirder things to happen out on the ocean.",

            "comment": "I used to do salmon spawning surveys, which involved walking up streams looking for fish. Some of the streams are quite remote and/or inaccessible on timber land, and you don\u2019t really expect to see any other person when you\u2019re out there. As a naturally smile-y, friendly, small feminine woman, I\u2019ve learned to be wary of people 100% of the time in the field. I actively try to avoid running into people when I\u2019m alone in remote places.\n\nOne of the survey locations is close to a highway. To get to it, I had to park at a pullout, follow a river downstream to a flagged trail, hike over a ridge to meet up with an old logging road on private timber land. I walked along the logging road for about 100 m before peeling off into the woods (very thick second growth Douglas fir reprod), where game trails eventually lead to the stream at the base of the hill slope. I came here during spring to survey steelhead, but this stream was also a survey location for other types of salmon during the fall. The game trails off of the logging road were flagged by previous surveyors, and multiple routes were marked. This made it kind of confusing, and not all routes actually led to the stream. Some just petered out once the vegetation got too thick. Another led to a cliff face overlooking the riverbed. Lots of faint trails. \n\nOne day I turned off into the woods one of the survey flags tied around a branch at the side of the road. I followed some pink flagging heading south along the hillside. I noticed the trail seemed freshly turned up, and figured maybe a bear clambered through recently since the time I was there last (2 weeks previously). The trail led to a small claustrophobic clearing, and the ground was freshly torn up in the shape of a circle. Seemed strange. I was looking for elk tracks but didn\u2019t see any. Then I noticed an assortment of bones scattered around the edges of the clearing. These weren\u2019t there before. Everything was dead silent, and something about it was setting me on edge. I poked around the bones a bit, trying to piece together this scene. I noticed another slight path, which strayed from my main route, veering to the right from the clearing. I walked a bit down that way, and gazed ahead trying to see if this path was flagged. It was densely packed with trees.  A subtle movement caught the corner of my eye ahead and to the right as I walked \u2014 I turned my head to look past the trees and saw the silhouette of a large shelter maybe about 50-75 feet from the clearing. It was surrounded by what looked to be jugs and bones. Tons of plastic jugs. Light shapes of bones on the ground. The lighting made seeing anything else impossible. Everything was so, so quiet. \n\nI left in a hurry, off the trail, without trying to get a better look, without getting to the stream. The alarm bells in my brain were screaming.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t know if the movement I saw was just a trick of the eye or if there was actually something moving. My gut feeling was someone was present at the shelter when I was there. \n\nAnother clarification, the jugs were large (e.g. not plastic milk jugs). More like chemical containers. It wasn\u2019t random trash strewn around the shelter. It was jugs and lots of bones.",

Growing up here has made me unfortunately very aware of creepy shelters made by drop-outers (folks who want to live completely out of society) because when I was a kid, my friends and I ran into one. It was a cabin in the woods absolutely papered in pornography\u2014but not just any porn. I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, because I was around 9 and this was some of my first exposure to sexual material, but all of the pictures were of children in sexual settings. My two friends were both younger than I was, and I herded them out of there super fast, but I\u2019ll never forget stepping into the cabin and looking around at all these red and pink papers, not knowing what they were, and the slow creeping discomfort when I knew they were something sexual. It\u2019s stayed with me for years, and I feel like whatever happened with that cabin can\u2019t be a good story. \n\nAlso, once, in the same area and with the same two friends, we came across a pack of clearly-owned dogs, barking and guarding this area across a stream. We could almost make out another cabin, and some smoke, and we yelled that the dogs were trying to attack us and to call them off....but no one came. My friends were two sisters, and the younger of the two (6ish) got scared darted off back down the trail, prompting the dogs to give chase. We had to run a good mile and a half back to the edge of town before they gave up.",

            "comment": "Used to teach outdoor education. Which was essentially just summer camp during the school year and school groups would come up and spend a few days at the camp. On their last night we would always tell them a scary story around the campfire. It was the same scary story every time. We worked in partners so there were always two staff members for every school group. One staff member would tell the story and the other staff member would go hide in the forest and make scary noises. So, I\u2019m telling the story and every few minutes there\u2019s like a snap of a twig or rustling in the bushes and of course as always the kids all get freaked out and they start getting scared. It\u2019s very fun. Well, as I\u2019m telling a story I\u2019m walking around the campfire looking at all the kids faces and I noticed a familiar one. My partner Eric. Sitting there smiling at me wondering why I\u2019m staring at him. My heart has never started beating so fast in my life. Eventually I sped through the story and all the kids left and I explain to Eric that I thought it was him in the woods and his eyes got very wide and he said are you telling me that that wasn\u2019t one of the staff members? So we both RAN back to the main road.",

My brother and I go in after the logging company's and grind all the left over piles of wood into trucks to take to the mills for wood pellets.\n\nBack in February of this year we were on night shift about 3 hours from the closest town and the few locals that lived out there warned us about a pack of Timberwolves that was about 25 strong and oddly fearless. \n\nIt was about 3 in the morning and we had worked our way down the block road about half a mile and one of us needed to walk back to the pick up truck to bring it closer to fuel up the machines. Of course I drew the short straw and went for a walk. Not even half way to the truck the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I felt like I was being watched so I sweped my flashlight beam across the treeline and all the eyes watching me lit up. Of course I left my shotgun in the truck, and I didn't think running was a wise idea so I kept walking swiftly while focused on the treeline watching the eyes follow me the rest of the way back to the truck.\n\nI got to the truck fine and obviously never left it too far away again. Ive had many creepy and interesting encounters in the bush but this one was definitely one of the \"Oh shit\" moments.",

            "comment": "I worked in a salt mine under Lake Erie a couple years ago, and generally speaking when things are brought down, they\u2019re never brought back up. It takes a lot of time to disassemble everything up top, secure and cover the parts, and put it back together down below, and vice versa, so there\u2019s tons of old trucks, tractors, and countless other things lined up in the far side of the mine. \n\nAnyway, in the 80s, U of Michigan and Cal Irvine were studying proton decay, and trying to capture measurements when it actually happened. Conducting this experiment top side is problematic because of cosmic rays and other forms of interference, so the mine was chosen as 2000 feet of earth absorbs pretty much everything. So they dug out a pool, about 80\u2019 by 70\u2019, filled it with 2640000 gallons of purified water, and put fancy cameras and other equipment along the side. They had a whole shop, lab, and dive center down there. \n\nI don\u2019t think they ever \u201ccaptured\u201d a proton decaying,  and eventually the grant money ran out after a few years so the mine threw up some caution tape on the main steel door leading to the study and that was that. Fast forward twenty years and I\u2019m working there as an electrician and I get a job to fix some big conveyer motor drive, so I set off and try to cannibalize some parts off old equipment. I remember one of the old timers telling me there\u2019s a bunch of abandoned equipment in an area by the keppy lift (the main elevator). I get over there and find a big steel door falling if it\u2019s hinges with some very old caution tape laying on the ground. The whole study had to be accessed through this one door, which was dug into the wall, so after awhile, the earth slowly crushes, bends, and pushes the ground up. After several tries, I yank the door open and step inside only to shit myself and fall back when I see a full scuba outfit (wet suit, mask, belt, gloves) hanging 3 feet inside. So I collect myself, find that I didn\u2019t actually shit myself (how, I\u2019ll never know) and go inside, past the goddamned scuba dude. Everything inside was left exactly how it was left 20 years ago, coffee cups left out, day planners, job schedules, along with tons of scuba gear, oxygen fill tanks, and computers. I make it about 10-ish feet to the edge of the pool, and it\u2019s hard to see if the waters still in it because there\u2019s no wind to move it, but eventually I see it\u2019s still there, 60+ feet of pure water in an absolutely dark pool. The sight of a huge black pool in a huge black hole in the ground, lit only by the small amount of light my cap lamp put out, and the absolute silence of being underground made me really uncomfortable, so I left in a hurry. \n\nSo that\u2019s my story, it\u2019s not particularly scary, but all that stuff sitting down there nearly perfectly preserved in a such an unexpected place was always just creepy to me. \n\nThe only pictures I can find of the study are in this page:\nhttp://www-personal.umich.edu/~lpt/erie.htm",

She had an old house and the town barely had any streetlights so the night sky was fantastic and the full moons were amazing. So any way she had \"Arachnophobia\" on VHS. I had never seen it and begged dad to let me watch it. He said, \"Sure but you're still sleeping out here in the living room\". That night was the longest night of my life. I was in a sleeping bag on the floor with a full moon outside casting all kinds of shadows through the blinds along with moving tree branches. Every goddamn shadow looked like a spider to me lol. My dad just laughed when he saw the bags under my eyes in the morning and asked \"How'd ya sleep?\" knowing full well what the answer was lol.",

He said one night they were under way with heavy seas, and had to adjust the tie-up between the tug-boat and the barge. (Forgive my nautical blasphemy I'm butchering these terms, he was the one with the time off shore...)\n\nHe described doing anything on deck, at night, in a storm, as about the most dangerous thing you possibly do, because outside of the weather and risk of going overboard, there was such high tension on various cables that if anything snapped it might come across the deck and cut someone in half.\n\nNow - he said this particular sea-going tug had had some \"history.\" One of the previous crew had \"gone missing\" before Dad's time on the crew, and from the way it wasn't discussed, but occasionally alluded to, there may have been foul play.\n\nSo in the midst of the storm, with danger and tension high, an argument broke out. Two of the crew started yelling at each other, and at the moment that everyone thought it might come to violence, a fire-axe flew across the deck and landed between their feet. No one was near the wall where it had been strapped down. A fire axe has its own bracket welded to a wall, with straps to hold it in place unless it's needed. They don't just come loose on their own, and the odds of it landing at their feet were impossible... except... that the two arguing were also the ones who had fought with the lost sailor.\n\nThey did not fight. They put the axe back in the rack. Everyone finished their work quietly, and it was not spoken of again until they returned to shore.",

            "comment": "Not exactly at work, but my previous partner was an amateur industrial archeology photographer, so we were often hiking to semi-remote locations to find abandoned factories, mills, storage facilities, etc. \n\nBeing pretty far from civilization, they were almost always completely empty. We found syringes and trash in several ones that were closer to cities or towns, and once a homeless person living inside, but nothing ever dangerous or creepy. Except once. \n\nThis was a massive paper mill located over a now dry stream, pretty deep within the mountain; think a couple hours hike away from the closest village. It was still in decent conditions, all things considered, but definitely abandoned. We'd been in less than half an hour taking pictures of the main building, which was still standing and had two exit points; one was the main entrance from which we had come in, and the other was the half-collapsed door that led further into the factory. We were about to move deeper in, when we heard what seemed like several dogs growling and barking aggressively. We figured it was probably another group of hikers with their dogs passing by, so we remained inside and after a couple minutes the growling stopped. We got back at taking pictures of a peculiar pyramid-shaped mound of debris, when the growling started again, but *much* closer. I was starting to freak out, as I thought it might be rabid dogs and we had no way to protect ourselves. We tried to gather where they were coming from and move in the other direction, when suddenly the growls and barks turned into screaming, quickly getting closer. We were properly freaked out at that point and started running to the main exit, when a gigantic man covered in rags jumped in from the other entrace, yelling and screaming at us things we couldn't understand in what was surely *not* our language. We sprinted out of there like crazy and run back to the trail, and didn't stop for a good five minutes before I couldn't keep up anymore and had to stop to breathe. We were *terrified,* but the man hadn't followed us outside the building and likely had no interest in pursuit once he got us to leave. Still we did the 2 hour hike back in a little over one hour,as the scare definitely motivated us. \n\nIn hindsight it was probably just a homeless/drug addict wanting to be left alone with his dogs, and the language he had screamed at us in was likely a dialect. But the fact that we didn't see any other sign of anyone living there, no trash or clothes or food, and the ghost dogs, plus the remote location left me a very creepy impression of the whole encounter.",

Well one night I'm working my tenth 12 hour night shift in a row, so I've had more than a few cups of coffee and find myself in dire need of a shit around 3 am. \n\nSo I head into the ol' mobile shit trailer (think 30ft double wide trailer full of urinals and stalls). So there I am pants, coveralls and a couple sweaters at my ankles, phone in hand minding my own business. When I hear the door creak open  and the shuffling of feet and the rustling of coverals as someone pops into the stall next to me. \n\nAt this point I'm already thinking this dudes is weird, there 30 stalls and he went into the one next to the one in use, but the weird level got turned up to eleven when I hear the tell tale rustle of a chip bag. My brain instantly recalls the stories of the \"chip shitter\". I listen in disbelief as this fiend rips open his bag of munchies and digs in. \n\nThe sounds of that monster munching down potato chips while simultaneously unloading what can only be described as a crime against humanity into that toilet, will haunt my nightmares until the end of my days.",

I've seen cats do that before too. To add some more context, the type of doves found were not native to this area.  It's possible they escaped or were released and had a run in with a hungry house cat. And the painted circle of trees and sticks nearby was coincidence.  Who knows--I certainly don't know what really happened so it's all speculation. It's still the weirdest/creepiest thing I've ever found.",

One time I delivered to a trailer park just barely inside our designated \u201cdelivery zone\u201d and it was very dark and poorly lit. I leave my car running and keep the headlights and inside lights on to go deliver the pizza. Upon returning to my car, I sit down in the drivers seat and look up to see a creepy old man standing less than 3 feet from my side of the car. He was just staring. It was the equivalent of a jump-scare. I just started driving forward, had to do a u-turn to get out of the park. When I turned around the man was standing in the middle of the road, so I freaked out for a second before speeding around him only to watch him attempt to *chase my car* out of the trailer park. I put in my two weeks after that.",

I was already running late from all my previous deliveries and I was still trying to find this house at 10:30pm, even though my shift was supposed to finish at 10pm.\n\nI\u2019m driving around the narrowest of country roads with nothing surrounding me but dark fields and hedgerows, looking for anything that might be a driveway. I hadn\u2019t seen another car or person for miles. Then all of a sudden I hear a loud thud on the side of my van, like something was thrown at it. No trees or anything else around for something to fall from, and I remember it specifically hitting the side. I looked in my mirrors and out the window but there was nothing around me. Then it happened again... another thud on the side of my van.\n\nI drove back to the supermarket so fast and told my manager that I couldn\u2019t find the place (I had spent 30 mins looking to be fair), there was no house where the listed address/postcode took me.",

So if it was a prank it was an expensive one. \n\nAlso, the only thing around for miles was empty fields, and the only place someone could have hidden was within or behind a hedgerow, so if it was a human they must've been hiding in a freezing cold hedgerow for over an hour since my delivery was supposed to be scheduled for 9:30pm.",

Anyway this one night I saw my friend hide in one building while I ran for the trees. I was hiding under some bushes and heard breathing. Like human breathing. There were no animals around. It creeped me out so bad I ran out of hiding to greet my friend. I felt so uncomfortable for the rest of the night. Some time during the night my dad heard something and went out to investigate. In the morning he discovered that one of our cows was killed and butchered.",

            "comment": "Not working in a remote place, but a holiday in a remote part of Iceland.\n\nI have always wanted to see the northern lights, so I spent a week travelling around Iceland a few years ago.\n\nThe weather was mostly cloudy so I didn't get to see anything for the first 5 days. On the second to last night we were staying at a little place in the middle of nowhere. I had booked an airbnb, but when we finally found the place it was an old run-down farm, just a couple of buildings at the end of a long dirt road. It was 40 miles away from the nearest other house, just old man and a cat that lived there, and he had put his spare bedroom on airbnb and said he would provide breakfast.\n\nIt was due to be cloudy again, so I didn't bother staying up. At about 3:30 in the morning something woke me up and I could see an eerie green glow coming in through the windows and realised that the northern lights were performing. It was bitterly cold, so I put on several layers of warm clothes, grabbed my camera and tripod and headed outside. \n\nThe northern lights were clearly there, but a couple of electric lightbulbs outside the farmhouse meant that it was barely visible in the photos that I took. I couldn't find the lightswitch, so I used the torch from my camera and headed out across the fields. \n\nI had walked about 150m, climbed over a couple of fences and got to a fairly large dip in the ground. Here I was in almost complete darkness, which meant the faint glow in the sky looked better. I set up the tripod with shivering fingers (I had to take my gloves off to fiddle with the clasps) and mounted my camera. I started hear some strange noises from around me, some rustling like there was something moving slowly, but it was windy so I convinced myself that it was just something blowing around. Occasionally the noises would stop for a few minutes before starting again, but I tried to just focus on taking the pictures and getting back quickly.\n\nIt was tough to get the camera in the right place as I couldn't see anything through the viewfinder or on the screen. I had wanted to get a slow exposure, so as I clicked the button I had to wait, as still as possible, for about 30 seconds. \n\nSuddenly I heard footsteps - something was running towards me at high speed, really fast, somehow running in the pitch blackness across very bumpy ground (even with a torch I had had to take it slow and careful). I couldn't see anything at all, and I FREAKED OUT. I don't think I screamed, but I felt absolute panic, gasped, as my fight-or-flight response tensed every muscle in my body.\n\nThe footsteps reached me and I felt a cat rubbing against my legs in an affectionate way.\n\nThe farm cat must have followed me.\n\nAfter I caught my breath, and laughed so hard that I felt a little light-headed, I stayed out there for another 10 mins, took a few lovely photos and then headed back to the farmhouse to go back to bed.",

            "comment": "I worked at a Boy Scout Camp for two years in High school as a summer gig. A requirement for the Scouts to earn their Wilderness Survival merit badge was for them to set up shelters among other activities. Before I was Staff, the Scouts would go 12ish miles into the woods for their night out to a place called \u201cShelby\u2019s Dream\u201d. The stories of kids waking up screaming talking about seeing ghosts running at them, being hung from trees, and other wild experiences. Everybody wrote those kids off. Called them crazy. Eventually there were things people couldn\u2019t explain, such as staff members waking up with scratches and cuts on their bodies. The backstory of the place is that there was a mass killing of Southern Soldiers (American Civil War) and Shelby was the daughter of the Southern Captain who was hung with his men. She supposedly came back to the camp to find her father and all his men hung from the trees. We stopped sending the groups to that location a few years back. One night my cabin mates and I went out there to see if the rumors were true about that place. I heard voices, cries, and screams that echoed in the forest. There\u2019s a point where you cross a bridge and, once over the bridge, the wilderness stops. The woods continue but there\u2019s no noise from animals or insects on that side. Absolute silence. That was one of the creepiest things I\u2019ve ever experienced.",

            "comment": "I was walking with my cousins about 14 years ago when we found what looked like an old burned out house. So naturally being kids at the time and having no sense of self preservation we decide to explore it. Mostly it was just full of charred wooden crap and junk but then one of my cousins found an entrance to a cellar outside. We busted the old rusted lock off the door and looked down inside.\n\nIt was dark down there and we didn't really have any reason to go poking around it plus we were starting to get creeped out so we kicked some dirt down into it and walked off. When we get about 15 yards away from the house one cousin says he hears a noise so we stop. And yep there was noise like somebody coming up the rotting cellar stairs of the house. We peek back through the trees and see a dark kind of fuzzy shape crawl out of the cellar which we left open. It looked kind of like a big old dog.\n\nAnd then it stood upright. We hauled fucking ass out of there. We all ran off in different directions like morons each of us convinced whatever the cellar thing was was chasing us. I ran right through some briars in a panic and tore my arms and legs all up which got me in trouble when I got home. We were all fine otherwise but we did avoid going that far back into the woods after that for a long time.\n\nClosest thing I can figure is there was a small black bear living in the cellar maybe it had another entrance we didn't know about and we woke it up being little assholes. But seeing something hairy and dark come out of that cellar then stand up was like being in a horror movie. I never want to see that old house again.",

            "comment": "I used to work at a Boy Scout Summer Camp. Every week I had to take a big group of campers to a \"secluded\" spot for their wilderness survival badge where they had to build a shelter out of sticks, leaves, etc and sleep in it overnight. The spot was only about 1/2 mile from the main camp, but we took them a circuitous route that made it seem really secluded.\n\nAnyways, on this one night all the campers had made their shelters, we had cooked dinner, and were all just sitting around the campfire. It was getting late, maybe 11:00, so I sent all the campers to their shelters for the night and started cleaning up the fire. That's when we heard in the distance what sounded like church bells. They were pretty faint, but myself and my fellow staffers could definitely hear them. They went on for about 30 minutes, ringing every 30 seconds, or so. We were all a little creeped out, as there were no churches or towns within 20 miles of us. After the bells stopped, though, the singing started. It was too faint to hear the words, but it sounded like church choir music, but **a lot** of people, and **a lot** more enthusiastic. Also, it was almost midnight at this point. The singing went on for well over an hour, sometimes quieting down until we almost couldn't hear it, sometimes getting so loud we thought it was getting closer.\n\nAll of the campers were super creeped out, but I lied to them, telling them there was a church service going on in camp, and that there was nothing to be scared of. Eventually, at almost 1 AM, the singing stopped. I found out a few days later that there had been a large KKK rally only a few miles away that night, and that's what we had heard.",

We noticed there were these creepy little porcelain angel figures on top of the graves , meaning that these were not super old graves or at least were being somewhat maintained. We didn't have enough time to finish before sundown, so we wrapped it up and headed back to the bunkhouse.\n\nWhen we came back Monday to finish the site, all the angels had been systematically covered by old cow patties, like someone was trying to hide them from us. That meant:\n\nA) People had been watching us that Friday afternoon, unbeknownst to us\nB) People didn't want us there \n\nWe called the USFS archaeologist we had been working with, and she told us to finish and leave as quickly as possible.",

            "comment": "I used to work with wildlife conservation and anti-poaching teams throughout Sub-Saharan Africa as an ecologist and ranger so I have lots of stories...the thing that always bothered me the most were leopards.\n\nIn one reserve we had a local guy who ran his own small guiding business. He would cruise around in his 80s Land Cruiser packed full with tourists and was notorious for breaking the rules (i.e. no off trail driving, don't get too close to animals, etc.) which is probably why people always booked him cause they almost always saw more.\n\nAnyway, one day he stopped his Cruiser on a concrete and iron bridge that carried its users over a creek that swelled and cascaded through the valley during the wet season.  It was dry season so the creek bed was cracked and bone dry. He let his passengers out to take pictures down the creek bed (it was a rather scenic spot). He said he had to take a leak so he walked to the far side of the bridge and disappeared under the spot where the bridge connected to the top of the berm that slowly sloped 30' down to the bottom of the creek bed. Next thing the tourists snapping pics on the bridge see is a massive leopard bound out from under the bridge carrying the guide's body by his neck. As soon as it appeared it vanished and a body was never found. All they located was a pack of cigarettes and a lighter he must've dropped in the attack. His last act of rule breaking got him killed.\n\nIn a different location a young tourist on vacation with her family slept on the open air second floor of the lodge they'd rented despite being told not to. In the morning her family came out to find the shredded hammock, pieces of clothes, and blood. They eventually found what was left of her stuffed in a tree not far away.\n\nHave lots of other crazy stories about poachers, muthi magic, farm raids, civil unrest, animal attacks, lost/missing people, etc. etc. if anyone is interested. At work now though so can't post too much till later.",

When working at night or working really deep, it is absolutely pitch dark, you can't see anything.  That in itself is a little creepy.  To add to the uneasiness, he said that sometimes he would be hit with a big swirl of water as if something very large, very close, just passed by him in the blackness.\nNow, let's take it up another notch, sometimes he would feel something brush up against his leg or nudge him. \nHe said his imagination would wander, and never to a good place. Totally creeped him out every time.",

It was basically rustic living for super rich people. It was a half hour drive to cell service, and an hour drive to the nearest town. I  finished my late shift at about midnight, and I was walking back to my cabin. I clearly saw an elderly man with suspenders and a plaid shirt walking by me on the path. We were not allowed to speak to the guests unless they spoke to us first so I didn't say anything to him.  It was pretty dark, to I turned around to make sure he was headed the right way to the guest cabins, and he had straight up disappeared. There was nowhere for him to go except into the thick woods, and if he had done that, I would have heard it. Very strange.",

            "comment": "I was in southeast Alaska for around 15 days a few summers ago. We had just finished up dinner and washed out our pots and pans and gone to our respective tents in the trees along the shore we had stopped at for the night. The spot we had chosen to camp wasn't ideal. The tide was set to come in pretty far that night and it would only leave us with a few feet before the water would be lapping at our tent flaps. But we also didn't care that much as it had been raining and incredibly windy that day so kayaking was hardly any fun at all and we needed to stop. About 45 minutes after we had said goodnight to one another I heard some splashing in the tidal zone, probably 20 feet from my tent. I didn't think much of it because a few times before when in Alaska we had stopped at beaches where the tide had risen to within a few feet of our tents. Anyway, I try to ignore it, although in my mind I'm freaking the fuck out. Our camp spot was less than ideal if you wanted to escape in the middle of the night. We were at the base of a relatively steep hill that was covered in alders and slick with rain, to the left, probably 70 feet from where we camped there was a rocky outcrop that went out into the water and was about 20 feet tall and steep enough that you couldn't climb it. If, for example, a grizzly bear (and there were a lot out that time of the summer, we had seen 4 or 5 that day alone, patrolling the beaches) wanted to see what was going on down the beach and walked towards us from the right it would basically seal off our movement. Sort of like putting the cork back in the wine bottle, not many places to go. Anyway, after 15 minutes of hearing splashing I start to try to rationalize it enough to go to sleep. But that's when I start hearing something other than splashing. This incredibly high pitched gargling sound breaks through the night's relative quiet. It sounded as though two cats had gotten into a fight but every time they let out a scream the other cat would push the one cats head underwater. This went on for a good twenty minutes. After it died down I hear \"that's weird huh?\" from the other tent, obviously trying to downplay the incident. I, being scared as fuck, just reply \"yep, going to sleep!\" Another 15 minutes pass without much sound, but then the same gargling breaks through the night, this time much much closer. The noises are deeper this time, more guttural. It sounds like an old man fighting with a cat, and each time either of them shriek they are forced underwater, the splashing intensifies and it sounds like it's right outside my tent. I think that the fear of whatever was going on eventually just zapped me of all energy because eventually i fell asleep. I just remember that I didn't move a muscle, and i didn't move for so long that all of my muscles ached after awhile and I could feel my heart beat in my throat all night long. Anyway, we woke up, had breakfast, broke down the tents and got back on the road. Didn't hear it ever again. A few weeks later I did some googling and I'm pretty sure that it was just some sea otters fighting each other in the intertidal zone. But it was scary as fuck. I'll link the youtube audio of the noises if I can find it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1: They were seals fighting, not sea otters, here's the audio: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqUO2L\\_UKEU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqUO2L_UKEU) Imagine hearing this as you lie in the cold dark in the middle of nowhere scared that a grizzly might come down the beach and eat you.\n\nTLDR: Lying in the dark in Alaska and hear guttural screams and what sounds like someone being drowned, in the pitch black in the middle of nowhere, 20 feet outside of my tent.",

I'm often transported by helicopter to very remote regions throughout the already very remote state. \n\nA few years ago, my field partner and I came across what seemed like a bear kill of a caribou carcass. But when we got closer it seemed odd. The only things that remained were TWO spines and one head. The head was arranged such that the mouth was wide open pointing up like it was screaming towards the heavens. The eyes were cut out. Very weird.\n\nTheres also been many instances of coming across old miner's buildings littered with dog skeletons or having strangely new children's clothing strewn about.",

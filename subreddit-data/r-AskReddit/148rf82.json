Don't be a half ass parent. You either go all in and give it 100% or you get the hell out of the way so that you are not blocking the way for other people to get shit done or for somebody else to fill that role and give it the 100% that it deserves",

Stress to her that my husband and I are here for her and will be here for her thru her pregnancy, regardless of my son and hers' relationship.\n\nAnd then I'm going to inform my son he's finding a job and getting a baby safe car, if he doesn't have either yet. I'll leave the rebukement to my husband because he'll be more patient and more focused on teaching him how to step up as a father, and I'll focus on helping the new momma thru life as her body changes. We'll help both with school, appointments, baby clothes, and offer advice when asked.\n\nThey've already made the mistake and will be dealing with the consequences.  No point beating a dead horse.",

It wasn't as capable as android, but everything on it was so smooth and clean. Ever since iOS 7 when they added transparency (color of background impacts the color of the screen you're looking at), it went to shit. It's so fucking janky compared to what it used to be. Granted it's way more capable, and does way more things. But the polished nature of it, always being super smooth, never crashing, has been gone for a decade at this point. Being forced to release annual full scale updates, basically removed any ability to fully polish it. It will be a sloppy mess for years to come.",

Now everything wants to predict what I'm going to want and do it before I ask and I fucking hate it. I don't want any buttons on my goddamn steering wheel, and I want up to be on and down to be off on every vertical switch.\n\nThe sound system in my car worked just fine twenty years ago, and everything that's been added or \"improved\" since then has made it more complicated to use and provided utterly no benefit.",

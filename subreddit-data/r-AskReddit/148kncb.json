Anya from Wolfenstein she is a badass again and bonus she kills Nazis for a living. And last is Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite and Burial At Sea. She is a character that grows. You see her changing as the game goes on. In the beginning she is innocent to the world and couldn\u2019t hurt a fly but as the game goes on she begins to learn the world isn\u2019t how it seems and it can be a very dark place. She learns sometimes you have to make hard decisions to survive and in the end realizes revenge isn\u2019t worth it and usually hurts others. She goes from an innocent person to a killer to someone who rescues. She grows as a person and understands in the end.",

It\u2019s too bad the story leaves her off to the side once Eliwood and Hector take the spotlight.\n\n**Karan Sjet** (Homeworld series)\n\nThe scope of her sacrifice and the atrocity she\u2019s seen, without ever breaking, makes her such a tragic figure. Homeworld doesn\u2019t spend much time on character development, but Karan\u2019s role as the Heart of the Fleet has always stuck with me.",

While most of them are gentler, aside from the party leader, Kerillian is mean and boy howdy will she let everyone know exactly how much they disgust her.\n\nWhile she does get marginally nicer over the course of the two games her bitter edge never truly goes away.  And there's no reason why it should.  She's can't return home, due to reasons in her backstory, and forced to party up with a bunch of people that she has spent centuries killing and hating.  Grudging respect and kind of liking them is a damn miracle.\n\nAlso while she's obviously very striking and pretty there's zero attempt made to play her up for fanservice.  It was nice",

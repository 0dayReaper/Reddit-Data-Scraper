It says her plane crashed in like Venezuela or something when she was coming back from a ski trip, and she not only survived but lived with natives for a while before making her way back to civilization on her own. She was so changed by the experience that she felt like she didn't fit in with aristocratic society anymore and began studying archaeology and indigenous cultures. Her family basically disowned her, but then were so impressed after she made her own fortune they had no choice but to accept her decisions. I always thought that was so badass, and was disappointed when they essentially changed her backstory to \"daddy issues.\"",

A foreigner in Fodlan, but not played for laughs like Petra or a \u201cbig reveal\u201d like &gt;!Claude/Khalid!&lt;. Fights for the Church but isn\u2019t faithful or devoted to Bishop Rhea. An absolute professional killer. Love her to bits.\n\n**Lyndis** (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade)\n\nA great \u201ccomes into responsibility\u201d arc as she rises from a plains nomad to a noblewoman and adapts to life in Lycia. It\u2019s too bad the story leaves her off to the side once Eliwood and Hector take the spotlight.\n\n**Karan Sjet** (Homeworld series)\n\nThe scope of her sacrifice and the atrocity she\u2019s seen, without ever breaking, makes her such a tragic figure. Homeworld doesn\u2019t spend much time on character development, but Karan\u2019s role as the Heart of the Fleet has always stuck with me.",

Anya from Wolfenstein she is a badass again and bonus she kills Nazis for a living. And last is Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite and Burial At Sea. She is a character that grows. You see her changing as the game goes on. In the beginning she is innocent to the world and couldn\u2019t hurt a fly but as the game goes on she begins to learn the world isn\u2019t how it seems and it can be a very dark place. She learns sometimes you have to make hard decisions to survive and in the end realizes revenge isn\u2019t worth it and usually hurts others. She goes from an innocent person to a killer to someone who rescues. She grows as a person and understands in the end.",

A foreigner in Fodlan, but not played for laughs like Petra or a \u201cbig reveal\u201d like &gt;!Claude/Khalid!&lt;. Fights for the Church but isn\u2019t faithful or devoted to Bishop Rhea. An absolute professional killer. Love her to bits.\n\n**Lyndis** (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade)\n\nA great \u201ccomes into responsibility\u201d arc as she rises from a plains nomad to a noblewoman and adapts to life in Lycia. It\u2019s too bad the story leaves her off to the side once Eliwood and Hector take the spotlight.\n\n**Karan Sjet** (Homeworld series)\n\nThe scope of her sacrifice and the atrocity she\u2019s seen, without ever breaking, makes her such a tragic figure. Homeworld doesn\u2019t spend much time on character development, but Karan\u2019s role as the Heart of the Fleet has always stuck with me.",

Chell from Portal again badass but she is also so stubborn and petty that she won\u2019t speak to you it\u2019s kinda funny. Anya from Wolfenstein she is a badass again and bonus she kills Nazis for a living. And last is Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite and Burial At Sea. She is a character that grows. You see her changing as the game goes on. In the beginning she is innocent to the world and couldn\u2019t hurt a fly but as the game goes on she begins to learn the world isn\u2019t how it seems and it can be a very dark place. She learns sometimes you have to make hard decisions to survive and in the end realizes revenge isn\u2019t worth it and usually hurts others. She goes from an innocent person to a killer to someone who rescues. She grows as a person and understands in the end.",

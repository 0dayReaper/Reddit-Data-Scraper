I grew up in the 80s and 90s and cue many scrunched up faces and requests to repeat it etc, questions on how it is spelled, how to pronounce it, where it\u2019s from, what it means, why I have that name. People often mispronounce it despite the fact that it is spelled completely phonetically. It\u2019s exhausting. Also feels very invasive. \n\nThese days I\u2019m sick of it and just go by the first four layers which coincide with a more \u201cnormal\u201d name.\n\nIf I ever have a child I would never do that to them. I might pick something a little unusual but never completely unknown / \u201cforeign\u201d. It\u2019s a massive PITA to be honest and I\u2019m so sick of the questions.",

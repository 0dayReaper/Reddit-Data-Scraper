I remember I had to stay in for recess to take a makeup math test, and I saw them setting up the giant (giant) tv cart with all the vcr and cable hookups so we could watch it live. One of the teachers from the 3rd grade was one of the finalists, so there was a lot of hype among the adults.  The intention was to tape it and show it in class later because of the school schedule, but since I was already there and done they let me watch it live with some teachers and a couple other students. I should also add I was really into space stuff and the space shuttle at the time.\n\nAnd I saw what I saw. I just remember the adults being stunned, people trying to rationalize how they could have survived even when it was clear they couldn\u2019t have. \n\nWhen recess was over each grade assembled in their home room areas while the teachers explained what happened, and I remember they let us watch the news. Probably because they didn\u2019t have words and wanted to watch as well. Essentially there were no classes for the rest of the day for us. \n\nI remember hearing about other big events, but this was the first time where I felt my world shake a little.",

My form tutor and the rest of the staff were informed during the lunch break (I assume some of the teachers went out to their cars for a crafty cigarette and heard it on the radio, I think the school had an aerial connection for the tv's so they probably tuned in in the staff room). He went absolutely apeshit at this boy, which was unfair because we hadn't heard about it, but I do understand why the form tutor reacted the way he did. It was the only mass school shooting the UK has ever had and it was just so incomprehensible.",

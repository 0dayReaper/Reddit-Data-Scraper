I would be in a white void with just shapes and random unidentifiable objects just floating around. It felt like I was stuck \u201cin between\u201d reality. I would wake up screaming and couldn\u2019t escape the void and my mother would have to shake me to get me back to reality. It\u2019s was crazy and hard to explain. I felt like I was in 2 places at once.",

Most nights it ends with me being chased through the woods by it or it coming in the house. But what makes it bad are the nights where the people with me are dead friends of mine. The worst is a friend that died in a car accident when I was 14 and his face was that of the animal.",

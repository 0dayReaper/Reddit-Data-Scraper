But her reaction to seeing him, and how she'd cry tears of joy each time and recount stories about them, my grandfather would spend most of his visits with her. She ultimately passed away after a few years, but on point:\n\nPeople in senior centers are just that: people. They need love, and in most circumstances I'd wager, they're not getting nearly enough of it.",

Volunteering to do grocery shopping for the elderly that can't risk going out, paying bills for them, etc. It sucks because that's a lot of trust to put on a stranger, but everyone I've seen post an offer like this seems pretty trustworthy. I'm glad that at least in my area, most are just good-willed people looking to actually help. It really warms your heart.\n\nOur local co-op owner and his wife also spend the day delivering groceries. Anywhere in town (so like up to a half hour drive ish) for only $5 delivery fee. Basically just covering their gasoline to do the dropoff. And if you want, they'll bring them right in the house and help you put them away! I can see the issue with that due to covid, but the gesture is amazing. He's also running tabs at his store out of his own pocket, for those that can't afford what they need on time, or waiting for cheques, etc. They're really awesome people!",

It\u2019s a matter of safety and security that unknown people don\u2019t just walk the halls - my local facility has had break ins and theft in the past. The residents there aren\u2019t able to protect themselves from any intruders if they wanted to do harm.\n\nAnd I will also turn that on it\u2019s head and say that a lot of people don\u2019t know or understand that not everyone there is a good person - they can harbor sexual predators, like any neighborhood, and can behave inappropriately with visitors or even children. If you take the kids to visit Grandma don\u2019t let them wander off alone because they could potentially be molested.",

Anyone in a care facility is vulnerable, and there are absolutely people out there who will abuse them given half the chance, so care homes really can't let people wander in off the street.\n\nIf you wanted to do this, the best thing to do is find a charity to do it through, or contact care homes in advance and see if they are looking for befrienders/volunteers. Either way they'll do background checks on you etc. so they know who you are.",

The elderly are more healthy and are happier. The young ones are better behaved and do well in school.",

It allows families that have no living grandparents or no or limited contact with the grandparents to have grandparents in their life. \n\nIt helps elderly people who want social contact and it helps families who want their children to experience grandparents. \n\nHow you interact with the \u2018rented\u2019 grandparents is up to you and your \u2018rented\u2019 grandparent. So if you want to do a lot together, they match you with someone who wants to be very active. If you want someone more laid back they match you with a laidback person\n\nEdit: They are called 'rental' or 'borrowed' grandparents. You don't actually pay to spend time with them. Should have probably clarified that.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award. If you like this, you might like the following information and article. People are starting to combine nursing homes and preschools because the children benefit from the elderly and the elderly benefit from the children. https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/01/the-preschool-inside-a-nursing-home/424827/\n\nEdit: Thanks for the second award.

Since we live closer together than my other grandparents I still see my \"additional\" grandma a couple times a year, 16 years after she and my family were paired up. \n\nIt was a blessing for us children who were able to see a loved one, who we knew loved us and cared for us, and who we were able to talk to about our family life as well (because we'd go there after school with no supervision where as all my other elders life so far away that we could only visit them as a family trip with the entire family there together and the children not really being able to talk or get alone time with the grandparents).\n\nIt was a blessing for my parents who were busy working and dealing with my dad's cancer diagnosis and didn't have any other family close by to help.\n\nIt was a blessing for my additional grandma who's younger family had moved away as well and whose husband had died a few years beforehand. She saw us grow up firsthand and was busy, but happy during the times we spent with her. Once we grew older she found a new hobby in traveling and met her current boyfriend, who she's been with for eleven years. But for those first few years after being widowed I believe we truly helped her feel loved and less lonely.\n\nI'd truly recommend this to anyone in one of these three (or similar) positions! Chosen family can be a wonderful gift.",

At the time they were only 2 and 9 and talked to anyone. It only took a few days for us to start chatting over the fence and only a few weeks before our children had a new grandmother.\n\nShe'd have Sunday lunch with us and we'd pop into each others houses for a cuppa. She was like a mother to me and hubby. She had children of her own but they lived abroad so she only saw them a couple of times a year. When she had to move into a care home we'd visit her and it was as upsetting when she died as if she had been my mother.\n\nShe taught the children a lot and I've never regretted it X",

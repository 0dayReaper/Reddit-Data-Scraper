The color and appearance on approach are consistent with a rock that has a high concentration of copper in it.\n\nThe thing in the back yard?  Beats me.  The only media about that part of the story I've found involves Photoshop and a crappy deepfake.\n\nDavid Grusch?  His background and service record are confirmed and independently confirmable (and impressive, I have to admit).  Consistently, when speaking he's been refusing to speculate beyond the data he's seen, he's following the US DoD procedures for publication in conjunction with classified matters (he can say this and not that, what he can say has been cleared for publication and discussion, when he can't talk about something he says he can't).  Most importantly, he managed to get his case up to the Inspector General's Office, which is exceedingly difficult to do because they deliberately put lots of safeguards in the way to ensure that their time is not wasted.",

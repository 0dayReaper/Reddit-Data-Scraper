But I\u2019ve still been wearing a N95 mask with face shield for 9 hours a day since February, while trying to make sure staff and patients mask up and stay 6ft apart too, and vigilantly wipe everything down with purple wipes.\n\nMy parents live in MI and traveled to TN, to visit family against my recommendation. So I\u2019m just home by myself, and will FaceTime them.\n\nIt\u2019s tough, for sure. But, we all choose to live in a society, and this is what a society is supposed to do; when a catastrophic event occurs, we are supposed to do what is best to save the society. It\u2019s a sacrifice for the greater good.\n\nBut, we are an Amazon nation who wants it, and wants it now. We live our whole lives as the individual; we worry about our school grades, our college acceptance, our job opportunity, our immediate family. And, never concerning ourselves with what is best for us as a whole. This a world filled with winners and losers in America.\n\nSo if you\u2019re like me, doing your part for what we perceive to be the greater good for all of us, then a sincere thank you to you.\n\nHappy isolated Turkey Day, and merry isolates Xmas to you. The end is in sight. The vaccine is almost here.",

The conspiracist feels empowered by these beliefs because s/he becomes part of an \"elite\" who know the \"truth\" (what they don't want you to know!).\n\n&gt;This also produces a confirmation bias where they seek the echo chamber of supporting evidence. **Contradictory evidence is dismissed because it is viewed as a personal attack by undermining the thing that gives them power and esteem.**\n\n&gt;All of this forms a self-feeding cycle where they not only double-down on their beliefs but become prone to believe in other conspiracies.

These people trust him because he's not part of the \"deep state\" (a term that I think just means career politicians ??) so anything he says, they'll believe. I don't know when we got so polarized or why everything became political, but it sure is a tangled mess. Our lack of education as a nation is starting to show I think.\n\nI'll also add, there's been a lot of economic problems for blue-collar workers with globalization (\"they took our jobs!\"), Income inequality is absurdly high, and the moral landscape of the country is changing. People who were formally served by or bought into a \"great America\" are feeling the effects of poor management. From all sides. So to put it simply, there's a distrust in the system, or at least the people who've been running it for the last few decades. They see Trump as the \"outsider with some sense\", so they trust him more than scientists (cause \"doctors are all hacks anyway, you know?\") Ok I'm done",

I told her many of the things you guys had suggested and mostly there was lots of crying. She thought I was mad at her (she's got a lot of anxiety and inner demons) so I was sending her silly videos and photos of my son all weekend. She loved them and just wanted to say over and over how much she missed us. We had a video chat and she got to play with my son for a little bit before bedtime. There's an Amazon Echo Show sale going on right now, we're going to try to scrape together enough to get one for my son and one for her so they can see each other easily more often. Thank you all for your kind words and advice. I'm sorry to everyone who is missing family and friends this holiday season because we're all doing the right thing. It makes it even harder watching others break the rules and live the normal lives we miss so much. I fear for the next two weeks as the effects of these super-spreader Thanksgiving gatherings begins to unfold. I'm so exhausted of living in survival mode and I know I'm not alone. Unfortunately this isn't going to be over any time soon.",

Then insisted all the office workers stay. So I walked out. I carried on working from home &amp; completed all my tasks. Got disciplinary action but he couldn't fire me.\n\nMonths later things have finally changed. But I've found another job. If that's how he treats staff's lives, he'll do it again.

Mandatory mask or face covering, spaced out seating, immediately to your seat once you have concession items, sanitize after every showing, etc. \n\nWith some recent increases to precautions (masks going from recommended to legally required indoors) they've had a bunch of conspiracy theorist types coming through their doors refusing the provided mask, pulling out a \"mask exemption\" card. They all tell you to go to the website for proof that its real but it just links to a far right, nazi sympathizing, anti immigration, racist shit hole website (that is almost always down because these dumb asses go to it do much and they are too cheap to upgrade their servers). Every single one says its violating their civil rights to deny them service, demand to have the cops called. \n\nI oblige them and call the cops for their trespassing and then spend the 20 to 30mins waiting for them reading off the Wikipedia page for the website they got this card from. I explain that they are directly supporting nazis by giving them ad revenue, I call them nazis loud enough that other guests can hear is and talk over them so they can't spout more of their shit. Most walk off before the cops arrive, I tell them not to return even after this is all over because we don't welcome nazis. One couple actually stayed until the cops got there and were promptly told their civil rights were not being violated and they were idiots and trespassing.\n\nI've had enough of these morons. If they don't want to wear a mask outside, whatever, their right for now. But come into a business and they aren't going to get their way, they are just going to be banned because they are a much bigger threat than any shoplifter.",

I'm wearing it because the government manufactured this pandemic narrative to get us to wear masks made out cloth that is laced with toxic chemicals that spread around like spores when we breathe out. The chemicals are meant to subdue us and make us more docile. Now that everyone's wearing this toxic cloth, the spores are all over the place. My mask is made of a material that's resistant to those chemicals. It's a special kind of cotton. I highly recommend making your own mask from cloth you have at home so you're safe from other people's mask spores.\"",

This thing gets to us and our whole family is going down. Sure, there's a 99% survivability rate, but 1% starts looking like a big fucking number when that shit hits your family fan. Does the mask work? I'm not going to argue with you. If there's even a chance I could save a life by wearing the mask and the only thing I risk is looking like a fool, I'll wear the fucking mask. I'll wear a rainbow clown afro and a honking nose on each nipple if that helps. I'll survive looking like a fool; people are dying from Covid. Oh, I'm living in fear? I wear oven mitts when I bake, I don't fear the fucking oven. I'm taking a reasonable precaution against foreseeable harm.   \n\n\nIf they're still in it with me after that, it's usually because blah blah blah God's will, and there's nothing I can do about that except say they're free to put their faith in prayer and I'm free to put mine in a mask.

I asked if they wanted me to go home and I found out that they had five other openings that day that they couldn't get filled.

We don\u2019t give these kids enough credit, we really don\u2019t.  They are carrying this society right now and just displaying such an incredible level of grace and flexibility; not just mine but most children.  They are struggling, too but just in a way that is so innocent, so devoid of politics or bias compared to the adults and they are discovering strengths and abilities within themselves that I think most adults should really admire.  I\u2019m proud of these damn kids and they keep me going.\n\nI wanted to edit to add: I appreciate people\u2019s concern and care for me so much.  I am so lucky to have a good support system and I am okay.  I am safe.  I have thoughts but never plans because I do absolutely know my value.  I just wish people gave more credit to the mental health side of this experience; I value so greatly our responsibility to stop the spread, to stay home, to mask but I also want people to know it\u2019s okay to struggle through it, we aren\u2019t alone in it even when it feels lonely.",

This shit has ruined my fucking life. I can't wait for a vaccine and to just get on with life.",

I keep wondering where all this anger is going to go in the next five years, what will it transform into? We will not unsee the hatred. We will not forget.\n\nI've struggled to keep myself alive for 20 years now. Since I was seven. I didn't choose this. I didn't ask for this. But here I am. Now, after all the hard times, after the months spent in the hospital, the possible years taken off my life- my biggest vulnerability is some asshat that fails to think critically? You've got to be kidding me.\n\nSorry, this was a bit of a rant. I just read your comment and out of all of these, yours hit me the hardest. Keep doing what you are doing. I am happy your daughter has such strong parents. We will survive this.",

I've struggled medically my whole life and had people feign support but a lot of those same people are not willing to take precautions in their own day to day life. Then get sad when I won't see them. I've stopped logging into social media other than reddit daily because I've lost enough in 2020. \n\n\nI was inpatient for five days with Crohn's last month. I'm on a new medication that obliterates my immune system and I also have a congenital heart defect. This isn't my first rodeo and I've suffered worse. \n\n\nBut if I suffered this much just to be taken out by some asshole months before a vaccine is available... The thought makes me so angry. Losing friends I've had for decades angry.",

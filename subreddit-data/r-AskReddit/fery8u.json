Cuckoo chicks are often successful because their begging calls, the supernormal stimulus, are representative of an entire reed warbler brood.[11] Due to the host parent's evolutionary instinct, elicited by selective pressures, they will select this exaggerated form of the stimulus. These calls will cause the host parent to primarily invest energy into the parasitic chick and provide it with additional food resources.[11] Studies show that the supernormal stimuli in cuckoo chicks alter the foraging behavior in parental reed warblers.[11]\"",

I'm not going to fap to it, I'm going to pull up REAL hentai for that.\n\nI think Gigguk nailed it when he said it was anime characters in a Hentai world and the writing and world building is way better than most of the shows from this season.  It knows what it is, leans into it, and still has a commitment to it's world in a way that's actually kind of endearing.",

Mike just sounds good for her American last name and doesn\u2019t stray too far from her identity ( no one will ever know to switch the last two letters of her name)",

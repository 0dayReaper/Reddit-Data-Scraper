I remember seeing the ceiling behind her shoulder  and focusing on eyes.  Mouths and other features wouldn't come into focus for me, but eyes could.  This all came flooding back to me because my mother has a small birth mark on one of her eyes and I could always tell it was her.\n\nAnother memory is being babysat by my aunt Jani.  I was put on the master bed and a while later another aunt dropped off my cousing Brent who was only a few months younger than me.  I remember I wanted the blanket he was wrapped in because the one I was in was scratchy and ugly.  I remember Jani checking on me twice, and both times lifting my head off the bed.  I remember the room, the yellow curtains, and sunlight coming in.  This would have been when Jani was pregnant with the twins so this would put me at about 6 months old.",

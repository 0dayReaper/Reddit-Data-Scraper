Permethrin will kill them so you probably don't need a full mattress treat just to ensure they don't take hold. You can also treat your bedding with it. Bagging the mattress with a waterproof cover will keep them out of it, as well, so you'll only need to treat the box spring and not something you'll come in contact with every day.",

Unless you have a massive spider infestation in your house (in which case you have another problem) they will not be preyed upon at all.",

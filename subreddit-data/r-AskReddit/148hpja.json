We were still in the flirting stage. \n\nWe had been hanging out and doing lunches together and we both knew we were into it but kept it low key.\n\nAs I was leaving her place I asked if it would be ok to kiss her goodnight. She smiled and said yes. I cradled her checks in my hands and gave her a soft long kiss. NO TONGUE.\n\nWell ... she jumped me. I was completely under lustful attack. I landed up spending the night. Oh... I still wake up next to her .. we have been married 24 years  :)",

What is my 25 year old self doing here when we could be at her hotel room fuckin?\u201d\n  \nSo we went to her hotel room and you\u2019re not gonna be ready for what happened.  \n\nWe played Mortal Kombat.\n\n\nAnd then fucked.\n\nI went back to my bar the very next day and had my beer.\nShe sat beside and goes \u201cfinish that beer, we have more to do.\u201d\n\nBut then you\u2019re never going to guess what I did.\nI finished that beer. And I ordered another. And another.\nWe stayed there for awhile. She was a nice lady. Coke to find out she\u2019s only in town for 3 weeks at a time. She travels for work to the point she sold everything. Work just moves her from spot to spot. Super cool lady. The evening went on and she is like \u201cokay, I need a fuckening.\u201d\nSo you\u2019re never gonna guess what happened!\n\n\nWe went back to her hotel room and played Mortal Kombat for like 12 minutes.\n\n\nAnd then we fucked.\n\nRinse and repeat for a couple weeks.\n\nShe ended up moving to my town and has a brilliant husband who I actually know very well. She still shows up and even brings him. He knows the story and has offered to open the relationship. That isn\u2019t for me however.\nNeat guy. Neat lady.\nI wish the best for them. They have been married a handful of years. I love their dog.\n  \nShe still sucks at Mortal Kombat though.",

One asked for a ride to get a pack of cigs, and on the way back told me if I were ever up for a \"diversion\", she'd be up for it. Another one, rather tipsy, whispered to me at a birthday party that she wished she could take me home with her. There were a couple more, but they weren't quite as forward as that. (I categorically said no to all of them, btw)",

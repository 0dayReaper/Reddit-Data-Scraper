We were still in the flirting stage. \n\nWe had been hanging out and doing lunches together and we both knew we were into it but kept it low key.\n\nAs I was leaving her place I asked if it would be ok to kiss her goodnight. She smiled and said yes. I cradled her checks in my hands and gave her a soft long kiss. NO TONGUE.\n\nWell ... she jumped me. I was completely under lustful attack. I landed up spending the night. Oh... I still wake up next to her .. we have been married 24 years  :)",

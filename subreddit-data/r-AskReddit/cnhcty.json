Some are stupid things he Googled when we were arguing about stuff (conversions, song names etc) and they made me giggle because it brought me back. Oh man I miss him so much... but at least now I have this little snippets of memories. \n\nThis seriously means the world to me. I\u2019m so glad I stumbled upon this today.\n\nEdited to say;\n\nI always use to harp on him for asking Google everything and using voice to text. I\u2019m so glad he was a smart ass enough to use it mostly for texting me and looking things up when we were together. For once, thank you for being a creeper Google. This is probably the only time I\u2019ll thank you for it and I\u2019m scared to look at my own data but.. thank you for this.\n\nEdited again;\n\nHoly shit you guys.... the immense outpouring of support from everybody is incredible.

It was annoying as fuck because it not only closed whatever app I was using, but also messed with my volume settings (cranking my speakers up to max, turning off  the ringer). Every time I contacted customer support the response was \"this is a known issue, we're working on it!\". After a LOT of looking around on the internet, I found out it was a pretty common problem with cheap mics. Most people were having issues with those cheap earbuds that came with a little mic on one wire -- which was a million times worse when you'd be listening to music and have the volume suddenly reset to max without warning. Others were triggering it with dishwashers, road sounds, or just brushing up against the mic. It took google TWO YEARS to fix the issue.",

I just have reddit and Instagram on my smartphone. \nMy period was just late, but the very next day I got bombarded by ads on Instagram about Clearblue and other pregnancy sticks and some other baby shit. \n\nThere is no way that it was a coincidence since it was the second time getting a very, very specific ad. So the app is listening, and showing me ads accordingly.\n\nEdit: autocorrect\n\nEDIT2: UPDATE &gt;&gt;&gt; I was telling my husband today about this thread and my comment, and guess what ad I got again on Instagram. \n\n[Ad ](https://imgur.com/gallery/9vwpUhP) \n\nI checked and the app had access to the mic. \nI think every time you wanna post, it activates the mic access\n\nEdit 3: since many people asked, I bought it with cash.

Healthy reminder for people to realize just how much data they really give out about themselves and how badly that could end if leaked or used for malicious purposes by some government or corporate entity.\n\nThe huge potential for each and everyone's very own personal shit hitting the fan and spread everywhere without a possibility to clean it up.\n\nEdit: kind thanks to the anonymous benefactor for the gold, I hope this thread is enlightening to many people.\n\nThis might be the day when I get to say \"RIP inbox!\"\n\nEdit: Holy crap! Thank you good people for all the awards. I've never been gilded before and have no idea what to do with those, but I'll find out.\n\nInbox did not die, but for a while it felt like close to choking to death. I read every message, did not reply to everybody, but I tried to thank each and everyone who gave silver, gold or platinum. I am thankful for every award.\ud83d\udc97 \n\nEdit 3: ok, inbox starting to be dead soon, hard to keep up with you guys. I hope I at least managed to up the Google's electric bill a tiny bit or broke a backup drive. Or that at least one Google's network dude noticed a spike in traffic.\n\nEdit 4: ok, this has been going on alk day now, perhaps should give up soon. I've pasted the same takeout link to around 10,000 people who have kept asking how to download the data.\n\nEdit 5: ok, maybe time to finish for today, it's been long and rewarding (pun intended). I think time to call it good night and let's see in the morning whatthe inbox looks like then.\n\nEdit 6: one person informed me that the YouTube's realtime statistics server has been haywire since the birth of this thread and another said that they had waited 24 hours only to receive message that creating the archive has failed.\n\nI think I broke Google.\ud83d\ude15\n\nEdit 7: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB4rqpFrKuw\n\nYeah. Apparently keyboard really is mightier than a Nasdaq listed tech giant's server farm. Not exactly what I expected to happen.",

Minor bit of background - I'm a straight guy with a lot of LGBT friends and was actively involved in supporting the Australian same-sex marriage campaign, so FB probably had me flagged as gay at the start of 2012. \n\nIn 2012 I started dating someone. We'd been friends for some time. I'm on Facebook all the time, she had an account but almost never used it.\n\nWe basically never communicated on Facebook.\n\nImmediately Facebook started telling me to mark her as a 'close friend' and all of its ads changed from \"Gay Singles Cruise\" and similar to \"Romantic Getaways for Couples\".\n\nI can only assume that it was able to tell from GPS that she spent a night at my place, and that I spent one at hers a few days later.\n\n_________\n\nEdit: A few guesses that wi-fi was involved. At the time I didn't have wi-fi at my place and while she did I never connected to it, it was 2012 and I had a 2 GB mobile data limit for the month which felt like so much that I couldn't imagine needing more...",

While it may initially sound useful, the power itself would be limited in scope and not particularly exciting compared to traditional superpowers. The superpower would only come into play when encountering tangled headphone wires, shoelaces, or other minor everyday knots. It would be quite underwhelming in the grand scheme of things, as it wouldn't have any significant impact on the world or enable any extraordinary feats. Nonetheless, it could bring some lighthearted humor and amusement to situations where knots tend to frustrate people.",

            "comment": "Look. this post is old. It's outdated. it's honestly shit. I do not know why I keep getting awards. so listen here fuckers. I no longer condone [playemulator.com](https://playemulator.com). Instead, go to [https://www.retroarch.com/](https://www.retroarch.com/) and download the installer. I'm going to teach you how to play all the games you would have played on playemulator much better on something that doesn't reek. Do not worry about computer specs. my shitty surface pro 5 can run it. it's fine\n\ninstall retroarch, then open it up and click load cores. It should be the first option you see. Select download a core, then choose a core for the system you want. Wanna play pokemon? grab a GBA core. Mega man? get an NES core. Final fantasy VII? we'll come back to that one\n\nInstall the core and you're ready to play a game; but first, you'll need a game! I don't believe I'm allowed to link to it directly, but check out a website called Vimm's lair if you want to accquire some illegal roms the safe way\n\nDownload the game files and move them to a cozy safe folder. Don't forget to unzip them! some of them, mainly playstation games, will require 7zip to open. You should really have 7zip anyway so install it if you don't. when your roms are all nice and snug, open up retroarch and scroll down on the left sidebar until you find an option labelled \"import content.\" Select \"import from directory\" and select your snugg little rom folder as the directory. Any folders inside that folder will be scanned if they also have game files in them, so keep that in mind! now, if you did that right, you should see your games organised by console underneath the import content option. Now, you can play them! wonder of wonders! hook up a controller or map the buttons to keys on your computer if you hate fun. You can also map hotkeys to speed up or pause the game! woo! if you wanna play ps1 games, you'll need bios; that's basically the playstation's soul! I'll cover that in just a second!\n\nOh, and if you want to emulate DS games: Don't! Use melonds or dsmume instead! the full versions, not the cores on retroarch! Retroarch has a fit when you emulate a touch screen, and is generally slower when playing ds games!\n\nSince you motherfuckers insist on continually giving me rewards, I'll tell you how to emulate PS1 Games on retroarch. You'll need a core. I like duckstation myself. To make it work you'll need ps1 bios! You can find downloads pretty easily online, but not all of them are safe! If you ever download a .exe file from a site claiming to offer downloads of ROMS or BIOSes delete it quick! Once you've got the ps1 bioses you need (they should be multiple files) you need to find your retroarch folder. It'll be in the folder you installed it to; I installed to my desktop, but if you installed it like a normal person it'll be in your program files folders, which you can get to from \"this pc.\" don't touch the system folder, you'll break things. when you've found the retroarch folder, open it up and go to the folder called system. this is different from the system folder I told you not to touch! don't get them mixed up or you'll REALLY break things! put the bios files into the system folder (the one inside the retroarch folder.) That's it! You don't need to do anything else, retroarch automatically takes the bios from that folder when you launch duckstation. Add your ps1 games the way you would any other game, then launch them! I really *really* reccomend a controller to play ps1 games.\n\nUnder no circumstances are you to attempt to play n64 games on retroarch. You should use project 64. It's as simple as can be, just download it and open a game and you are playing it. the complicated stuff is the plugins and configuration to make certain games work.\n\nTwo more of you FUCKERS gave me awards just now. Fuck you. here's how to emulate ps2 games\n\nPCSX2 is the only emulator you'll want for this. I reccomend the portable version, since it makes it easier to find the folders where you might want to put things. like bios for instance. you still need to give this thing a piece of a real ps2's soul, don't forget. Legally speaking you're meant to steal it from your own ps2 but you won't have trouble finding it online. When you first launch it, it should ask you to select a bios; when you see that window, look inside the PCSX2 folder; you should see a bios folder has been created. Put your bios in there and select it in the window. most downloads will include multiple bioses; this is good! this will allow you to play games from other regions! just select the most updated US bios in the window for now. There's a lot of tweaking and fiddling you can do with PCSX2 to make it run games on potatoes or use the power of super ultra mega gaming pcs to run these 20 year old games in 4K, but as it is now, you should be able to play PS2 games on it, believe it or not.\n\nThree years. It has been three years. how do people keep finding this post. Fuck you. If you want to play modified ROMS such as hacks or translations in retroarch you need to click on import content, click manual scan. Click content directory to find the folder containing your altered rom. Click System Name and choose the console it's for. click file extensions and choose the type of file your game is. Usually it'll be an abbreviated name of the console (GBA, SFC, MD, etc.) If it's a disc-based console like the PS1, you'll want to use the CUE file extension. When you've sorted that out click Star Scan. Now go fuck you'reselves\n\nI have nothing more to teach you my children.  \nSO STOP GIVING ME AWARDS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Tutorial is over. Below this point is the old comment, which is what actually got me most of those awards in the first place.**\n\n[Playemulator.com](https://Playemulator.com) has almost every game from NES era to NDS era. Most of the pokemon games, the good sonic games, several N64 classics and countless hidden gems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: It is also browser based, so no downloadEdit 2: yes, it saves and loads saves great\n\nIt's been a year please stop giving me awards\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still get awards for on this comment. it has been 2 years. Please. Please stop. I don't even reccomend this website anymore, retroarch is so much better stop this\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomeone just gave me another wholesome award. I'm serious stop. Please. this isn't even a good site for emulators. This was 2 years ago. I've moved on. you should all move on. how are people even finding this post anymore. fuck.",

Lines, plot points, character names, publishing date, etc. I just used them to find this picture book series that I loved so much I checked it out of the library every month between the ages of 8-11. Even though I read it over and over hundreds of times, I could only remember certain things. \n\n1. There was a plot point about \u2018the green eyed monster\u2019 in one of the books.\n2. It had to have been published before I started reading it in 2008.\n3. Rose MIGHT have been one of the characters names. \n\nThat\u2019s all I could remember, yet I found the book series within 30 seconds of searching for it. It\u2019s a great resource to keep on hand!",

If people like them, I'm happy to add more from my list :)\n\n* 'Calculate Your Total Time Watching Tv Shows' - It does what the names says. Super good for figuring out how long certain episodes, seasons or shows will take. You can select specific episodes or shows too!\nhttps://tiii.me/\n\n* 'How Many People Are In Space Right Now?' - It gives you the exact number, basic information about the astronauts, how long they've been there and links to their wikipedia pages. I just think it's really interesting to think about how many people are above my head and floating around out there right now. \nhttps://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/\n\n* 'Ninja Burger' - It's a fake resturant that parodies a burger places based on ninjas. Love the website, think it's really funny. Good place to waste time. \nhttps://www.ninjaburger.com/about.shtml\n\n* 'Post Secret' - Lots of people in the US know about it but I feel like outside of the US, it's lesser known. People send in their secrets on postcards creatively decorated. Every Sunday there are new and repeated secrets. It's fascinating and I check it weekly. Also they provide suicide hotline phone numbers for people who are thinking of harming themself. \nhttps://postsecret.com/\n\n* 'Down For Everyone or Just Me?' - If a website isn't working and you're unsure what's going on, use this. I find it particularly helpful to check 'Blackboard' for university because 50% of the time it's me and 50% of the time it's 'Blackboard'. \nhttps://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/\n\n* 'The Wiki Game' - It's a website that uses Wikipedia in different formats in 'Kevin Bacon' style games. Basically get from one topic to another using the hyperlinked content in Wikipedia articles. There are play options including timed, versus, within a certain number etc. \nhttps://www.thewikigame.com/",

            "comment": "I was in middle school, walking home from school. I always walked by this apartment complex that seemed very calm. That day, a little kid, let\u2019s call him Tom, maybe 8yo was in front of the appartement complex. \n\nTom came to me, he told me about \u00ab\u00a0big boys\u00a0\u00bb, he wanted to go home but was too scared  to go alone because of those boys. He asked me to go with him. He wanted me to walk with him to his building door. \n\nI was 13 or 14 at the time, I was a people pleaser,  didn\u2019t know how to say no, and little Tom seemed really scared. I said no one time, but he seemed so sad, I felt bad and ended up saying yes. \n\nI remember entering the appartement complex, Tom telling me his building was the last one (of course!) While we were walking towards the building, I remember turning around, to see the fence\u2019s electric door closing. I got scared.\n\nTom and I arrived at the building door. I was like \u00ab\u00a0 well, you can go home now, bye\u00a0\u00bb all I wanted was to get out of this place. \n\nTom asked me to walk with him to his appartement. Now it was really shady! I told him no, I\u2019m not going inside. Suddenly, a group of little boys popped from god knows where, I did not saw them coming. \n\nThey started to talk about the big boys, how they were scared of them, and how the boys would never do anything to me, because I was a girl. I was trying to find excuses, the little boys were more and more pressing, then they became agressive, screaming at me to go inside. They were getting closer to me and  started to touch me. \n\nTrying to stay calm, I said \u00ab\u00a0if I walk all of you to your appartements, I will not be able to open the door to go out, I don\u2019t have keys\u00a0\u00bb\n\nThe kid who was next to the door told me not to worry, the door was broken and the lock wasn\u2019t working anymore, so I would not need keys to open it. This kid was smiling with a terrible smile, it was so ominous and unsettling.\n\nThe boys next to me grabbed my arms, some pushed on my back and the kid next to the door put his hand on the handle to open it.  Everything went blurry, I was terrified, i knew that things were about to get really bad. But the door did not move. \n\nIdk if it was repaired or stuck, but that door did not open! The boys started arguing about the door, accusing each other, screaming at each other, and they suddenly forgot about me. I took my chance and ran for my life, I heard them screaming at me, and then a heard the \u00ab\u00a0big boys\u00a0\u00bb voices, telling me \u00ab\u00a0come back princess, we\u2019ll take care of you\u00a0\u00bb. I keep running and look behind me to see a small group of guys, maybe 18yo, with the kids. They were calmly walking towards me. \n\nStill running, I took a corner and bumped into a man. He was maybe 40 something, and seemed safe, I frantically told him about what just happened. He took a look at the place I was pointing out, but all the boys had disappeared. \nHe walked me to the fence, opened the electric door for me, and told me something like \u00ab\u00a0it\u2019s not really safe for young girls like you, i don\u2019t want you to come back here\u00a0\u00bb\n\nYears later, i was a work, it was a slow day. There was this new girl, we started to chat, getting to know each other. \n\nLong story short: she used to live in this appartement complex, but moved when she was a teen. The police arrested multiple guys. They were accused of rape, they used little boys to lure young girls into the buildings and gang raped them. They payed the little boys with candy and Pokemon cards. \n\nMy life almost took a terrible turn that day, and I will never be grateful enough for this nice man i bumped into.",

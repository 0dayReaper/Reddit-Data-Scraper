All the money they make on their cows goes right back into new cows, fresh vaccines and healthcare for the cows. Calving season sounds horrid too. \n\nAnd then when they sell it, what happens to it? I think he's insane for wanting to go back to the ranch but shit that's his family legacy right there, they feed us, he's got a personal connection to it. \n\nI've always been worried about that. What happens when you squeeze out the ranchers and farmers? An apartment complex or housing development is only going to make local food more expensive. They're a critical workforce just to keep society running, and I really would hate to see the way of life disappear and become corporatized.",

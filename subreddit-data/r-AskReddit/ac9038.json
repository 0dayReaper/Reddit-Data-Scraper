Icelanders are automatically registered as a member of their mother's church upon birth and have to opt out if they don't want to be registered as a church member. My Icelandic friends and I call it \"Christian by default\". Leads to a lot of interesting cultural and religious views of what it means to be religious or not.  Most people don't unregister, but just never go to church. And the churches registered with the government still receive money from the state for anyone registered as congregants/members. Churches receive roughly $7.00 per month per registered individual - regardless if they regularly attend or not. Only in recent years have people started to actually bother unregistering from their churches.",

The government basically collects the equivalent of an income based membership fee for churches. \n\nAs a German myself I don't see too much of an issue with that way to regulate things, in principle at least. I was (as somebody who was never a church member) never directly affected but my primary concerns would be around how people enter that system (when starting to work or when becoming a church member) and to what extend they are then informed about that tax. \n\nA more complicated topic would be how that tax as key finance source for churches shapes churches and by extension society and how the government should/should not influence that. The Church or Worship Tax (in case of non-christian religions) makes up around 70% of German church incomes...which of course has a major impact of their financial situation generally, it for example gives them a sort of financial safety net French churches just don't have - and you see that just by looking at the physical conditions of churches in comparison. Another impact is that for example church associated youth organizations are well funded relative to other (non-church) youth organizations, which may get money from other sources (lotto pays for sports clubs I believe) but I can tell you that for example non-denominal scouting organizations are in far less comfortable financial situation than the church associated ones which basically get financed through the church members paying Church Tax while the non-denominal ones have to rely much more on their scout members for financing (all get some financing from the government but thats dwarfed by what the church assosicated ones get from their churches).",

In this moment of trauma it becomes not about you, not about your loved one, but about other people. It's rough. I trust the Drs. when they say your loved one is brain dead..but when their body is there breathing and his head swollen part of you doesn't understand why you can't just wait longer, hope longer..see him lose the swelling and maybe give you just one more look before you give up on them.\n\nETA and just to be clear, I think this bill is a good thing and I am a donor myself. It's just a sad affair sometimes and more complex than it seems.",

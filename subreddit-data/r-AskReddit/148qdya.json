I don't think it's all that significant, but it was probably the right thing. \n\nFWIW, I'm seriously considering voting for Asa Hutchinson if he makes it on the ballot in the general election in 2024. I don't love a lot of his personal opinions and ideology but as far as actual policy goes I feel like he's the mainstream candidate closest to my beliefs. A large driving factor in that is that I'm transgender, and he seems able to placate the far right on gender issues while still respecting personal choice. At least that's what he managed to do as governor of Arkansas. I've also never voted straight party in any election.\n\nEdit: I mention the Asa Hutchinson thing because in personal ideology I'm pretty far left.",

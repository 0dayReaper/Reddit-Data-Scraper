Some scientists believe that the the universe is in what is considered in an artificially high energy State and one day it might slip down into a lower energy state which would make atomic bonds impossible and create a vacuum decay bubble that expands at  the speed of light basically annihilating all matter in the universe.\n\nThe scary part is because of how big the universe is it could have already happened and a low energy State bubble of annihilating space decay could be speeding toward our solar system at the speed of light as we speak",

It would be impossible to detect because the moment it hits you, your dead.\n\nThat is to explain, if we are able to see a \"Bootes void\" (an area, simply with little matter), then it cant be vacume decay, since it travels the max speed of the universe, same as light.",

We hit a rough patch a couple of years ago and she took me for coffee to talk about it and assured me that even if the worst happened, she would *always* be there for me and in my life whether he liked it or not, because she loves me. \n\nI didn't know what a real family was supposed to be like until I met them either. For my 18th birthday - the first birthday I spent with him - my boyfriend asked me what I wanted to do, and I had never really celebrated my birthday since I was a child because we either couldn't afford it or my mom and I were fighting over one thing or another. He knew this, because I told him. So, on my birthday my boyfriend picked me up, took me to McDonald's to get a mcflurry, then took me to dominos to pick up the pizza he ordered for us. When we got to his house, his mom had most of the lights off and she was standing in the kitchen with a cake, candles lit, and a gift bag on the counter. They started singing happy birthday when I walked in. To say I cried is an understatement. They have done this every single year since then. \n\nChristmas is regularly celebrated in my family because we save up for it. But man, that first Christmas I spent with my boyfriend I cried *again* because when I got to his mom's house there was a stocking with my name on it and it was *full*. His whole family got me gifts. I wasn't prepared that year, but the next year I went ALL out on gifts for him and his family. His mom includes me in absolutely everything. And when I can't make it to something, I know damn well she'll be phoning me on her drive home to tell me all about it and give me all the gossip.",

Of course he said yes. Unfortunately two years ago or so she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and today her condition is getting worse and worse to the point he can't leave the house anymore. He has experienced unimaginable pain for a man to now go through what is essentially two deaths of wives in his life. Again, nicest guy ever and the positivity he's always carried about himself. But yes if you have a good relationship with in-laws, keep it. Chosen family is forever.",

            "comment": "Happened to me. Recently.\n\nMy ex passed away on dec 18 2022 from a sudden case of severe pancreatitis due to a reaction from a chemotherapy drug she was told to take by her doctors to treat potential return of adrenal cancer. There was no sign of the cancer as of her latest scan but they said take it anyway. The drug was Mitotane.\n\nShe died in horrible pain and extremely scared. It was a traumatic experience. Her family appreciated me being with her through all of it. They said I will always have a place with them.\n\nI talk to them every couple of weeks. I plan to continue to do so, even when I have a new relationship.\n\nEdit: people asking me some questions in DMs. I am detailing the events of this here now. I also want everyone to know that I\u2019m doing a lot better now. I\u2019m sharing this in case anyone wants to know or has a similar experience with trauma to know you\u2019re not alone. This is not a happy story, but I\u2019m really doing much better now. Really. I appreciate the kind words.\n\nWe were not married but we were engaged.\n\nDec 9 2022, my gf called me at 7am saying she felt sick. I initially was like, upset and frustrated with her. At the time it was the first day of the new season for the game I play and I thought \"Ugh she's sick on league start day, what a bummer.\" I had no idea what was to come. Unfortunately, this quickly became a much worse, much larger issue. \n\nShe said the stomach pain she had was progressively getting worse, so after about 15 minutes we rushed to the ER. I was obviously concerned and felt bad but still was not that worried, i thought maybe she has an internal cyst burst or appendicitis or something. Sure it will be bad, but she'll recover. Unfortunately this was not the case. She was diagnosed with Pancreatitis from a complication due to a drug she was told to take from her doctors. Initially I did not worry because, I mean, she's young and healthy, so she'll be fine, right? I mean she\u2019s 36\u2026 she\u2019ll be fine. I went home from the hospital, sat down to play my game and did so for like 30 mins but I was quickly becoming more worried and I couldn\u2019t enjoy it or focus on it. The next day, I was becoming increasingly worried as the doctors were talking about how they \"could not stabilize\" her and she was experiencing \"Multiple organ inflammation.\" This quickly became unimaginably scary. How can you go from being totally fine to organ failure as a young healthy 36 year old? I was very very worried, but still I thought she would be okay. I couldn\u2019t play my game, couldn\u2019t eat, couldn\u2019t think about  anything. I was way too nervous and anxious and was spending most of the day in the hospital.\n\nBy the next day, Saturday night, she was heavily sedated. I went to see her, she woke up, and the last thing she said to me was \"Baby, I don't want you to see me like this, I'm suffering so much.\" She was in agony. She said her insides were twisting and burning and stabbing and aching. She could not be consoled. I just told her it's ok baby, you'll be fine. This was by far the most traumatic part of the whole experience. \n\nShe was not fine. About 8 hours later at 2am they said she is crashing and they have to intubate her to try to save her life. The next morning they said she could not be stabilized and will die that day. I was in disbelief. How is this possible? So I waited with her all day. I was in shock. \n\nAnd she... didn't die. Yet. Her body was young and was trying to recover. \n\nI stayed up in the hospital everyday with her for 8 days as she was breathing through a ventilator, hooked up to dialysis in the ICU. Tubes everywhere, it was a terrible thing to witness. The doctors said the chance she recovers is almost minimal but they've \"seen miracles before.\"\n\nIt was without a doubt the longest days of my life.\n\nOn Dec 18, 2022, she passed away as the CT scan showed that her pancreas was far too inflammed and multiple organs were affected. She had swelling in the brain. We took her off of life support and watched her pass.\n\nI thought I had been through many rough experiences in my life. I thought I understood stress. In 2013 I found the dead body of my best and closest friend who died at 26 with an undiagnosed heart condition (rip /u/ahd887) . In 2018 my father had a heart attack and dropped dead in front of my family. I've seen a lot... but staying up watching your gf cling to life and not knowing if she will recover or if she recovers will she be disabled or have brain damage... **THAT** is stress. And the loss was immeasurable. For a week straight I was just unable to do anything. I have a regular schedule of gym, Jiu Jitsu, work, gaming, and my gf. I could not do anything. At all. It was like a TV where they show a time lapse of someone standing there totally still as the days go by behind them. Then we had to do the funeral, I had to give the eulogy because her parents weren\u2019t capable of it, and I mean yeah. It was hell.\n\nI could not rely on my family because the situation was unbelievably complex. My mother hated her; absolutely fucking hated her due to my mother\u2019s own biases and prejudices, and I chose to not even tell her what was happening because I know my mom and she would have said something that would have made me unable to ever forgive her.\n\nI relied very heavily on my sister and my best friend. He was as empathetic and helpful as possible. I was more or less living at his house for 8 hours a day, talking when I needed to, crying when I needed to, smoking a ridiculous amount of weed, and staying completely away from any and all other drugs and alcohol. I don\u2019t suggest relying on any substance to deal with trauma, but I did, and I\u2019m just being honest. Thank fuck I no longer drink alcohol.\n\nAnd I mean\u2026 in time\u2026 you start to heal. There\u2019s nothing else in the world that will help but time. \n\nA few months went by and eventually you find yourself able to find joy in things again. It took several months. I finally got back on the mats and found joy in training again. I finally got back into the gym and lifted again. Eventually I started playing my videogame again.\n\nI will never ever fully let go of the trauma; that\u2019s with me for life. But you will move on from it. We don\u2019t have a choice. \n\n\nI will get better, but her parents will have a loss that is likely *far worse* than mine. I owe it to them to check in on them every now and then. \n\nI am 38. Getting older is loving things, then losing them, then finding new things. You can\u2019t experience love without knowing that at some point you will experience loss of that thing. Everything you love will be lost. Your pets, your family, your car, your loved ones, even the universe itself will eventually die. \n\nI\u2019ve come to learn that this truly is the human condition. But it\u2019s not as depressing as it sounds. Because The loss doesn\u2019t erase the love, it\u2019s just part of it. It\u2019s what makes it special. And as you experience more of the loss, we\u2019ll it doesn\u2019t get easier, but you just get better at dealing with it. The world will keep spinning, and you find new things to love. It\u2019s all we can do.",

The weekend I lost it, SIL called my husband asking if she *had* to talk to me (husband said to leave me alone for for the first few days). My birthday was 2 weeks later - she sent me a champagne picnic basket.\n\nThen 2 weeks after that she texted me telling me what she was up to the weekend I lost my pregnancy. I mentioned oh yea, that was the weekend I lost a wanted baby and she just ignored it and went on about what she did, ending the conversation with a giggle emoji.\n\nMIL defended her actions saying the champagne was just a mistake and SIL just didn\u2019t know what to say at the time. Excuse you, an insincere \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss\u201d would\u2019ve been the bare minimum. But apparently I should be the bigger person and understand SIL\u2019s perspective.\n\nEdit - I guess I should clarify. SIL was given a chance to right this wrong by just apologizing. Instead she told my husband she\u2019s done nothing wrong and has nothing to apologize for. So we are NC with her and LC with my MIL. I expect in 4-5 years time we will also be NC with MIL for reasons that I won\u2019t elaborate here.",

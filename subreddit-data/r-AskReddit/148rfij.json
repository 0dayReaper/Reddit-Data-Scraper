I have literally gone from looking 25 to 35 in about 3 years and you just get treated differently.\n\nI'm not even a boomer but I think using boomer as a pejorative wouldn't have stood back in the old days of Reddit. So yeah, I'm getting old.\n\nI tell you something the popculture subreddits have exploded. This used to be a place for nerds and FauxMoi shit about Taylor Swift would never reach /r/all.\n\nOld man shouting out cloud over and out.",

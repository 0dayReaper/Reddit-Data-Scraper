I figured that if you drink caffeine first and then go for a 20-40 minute powernap, you wake up super energetic. The only problem is that you have to actually be pretty tired to fall asleep fast enough before the caffeine kicks in.",

See, he's got this persona--somewhat cocky and unafraid of ridicule. Me, introvert that I was, wanted to be more outgoing. So one night I was at a party and there was this cute girl there and I was too shy to speak with her and for some reason I asked myself *What Would Bruce Campbell Do?* Why, he'd just go over there and talk to her. If he got shot down, no biggie: there's plenty of other women out there. And it worked! I went over, chatted with her. Got shot down, but hey, I did it. I took that first step. \n\nFor the next year or so, I would continue asking WWBCD? Eventually, becoming more outgoing just became natural instinct. I am still a bit if an introvert, but much less shy.",

The cute girl at the walk-up window asked my daughter what the kitten's name was.  \"Princess\" was the response.  Smiling and feebly attempting to make conversation, I said \"Today\" to indicate that my daughter changed the cat's name frequently.\n\nI got a dirty look and the girl left the window to go make whatever cold treat we had ordered.  It wasn't until later, on the walk home, that I realized that she thought I was telling her to hurry the hell up and make my order.  Still haunts me years later for some reason.",

I didn't realize this until I saw the video my aunt had made for me. You can see my dad lean in to give me a kiss on the cheek but I just keep walking. He kind of shrugs and then goes to sit down. It's been 18 years and this still flashes through my head when I'm trying to fall asleep. \n\nAlso, that time I was trying to get to get to the school bus and the sidewalk was icy, so I slipped and fell really hard on my butt. The kids on the bus laughed at me, so I chose to sit there with my head down, wishing I could disappear, while the bus drove away and I walked a mile home (yes, in the snow, uphill, both ways).",

Realizing I'm too drunk to sing I pick my name is by Eminem as my song to perform. There's two versions of that song. One is the original release, the other tamed down (which you most commonly hear today). The woman controlling the music put on the original, and off i went. One of the lines at the end is \"running over lesbians in a spaceship while they screamin at me lets just be friends\". I finish the song and I'm met by applause from my friends and one other table. The rest of the place is silent. The DJ goes \"nice job! Don't know if it was the best choice for gay women's night though.\" And at that moment i wanted to leave my skin.",

Darrell wasn\u2019t a real person. The joke wasn\u2019t really funny, and made no sense out of context, but I guess that\u2019s why it was an inside joke.\n\nFriend group #2: I was hanging out playing some drinking games with a bunch of people that I hadn\u2019t hung out with in a while. It was a kind of get together to remember a friend that they had who had recently died in a car accident. I didn\u2019t know him that well, but I was always down to party. \n\nAnyway the phone rings, and the person who answered started listing off names. Sorting my cards for another round of Presidents and Assholes I offhandedly said \u201cheh and Darrell!\u201d. \n\nIt was the typical record scratch moment where everyone stopped and looked at me. Darrell was the name of the friend who had just died.\n\nThis happened in 2002 and I still think about it all the time.",

It wasn't me, it was my neighbor. \n\nMy neighbor is morbidly obese and my mom is Korean, and they joke with each other about it. My neighbor makes racist commits to my mom, she makes fun of my neighbor's weight. It's just part of their friendship. They often did it in public too, but it was always obvious when they were standing next to each other that it was inside joke.\n\nAt one point my neighbor was out with her husband (they're both white). She was at a check out counter when she blithely remarked about all the damn Koreans taking over the region. \n\nThe check out lady just stares at her. Then the husband leaned over and said \"It's not as funny when [Dragonmeme's mom] isn't standing next to you.\"\n\nCue my horrified neighbor desperately trying to explain that she wasn't a racist, that it's an inside joke. \"My friend is Korean!\" which of course just made her look worse. \n\nMy mom lost it when she heard the story.",

            "comment": "When I was in the 4th grade, I lived in the middle of nowhere and there was practically no minorities, just white country people. This Mexican family had just moved in and could barely speak any English and I befriended one of the kids my age in school. He came over to my place and we were both joking around about his bad English. Just doing what kids do. I would pretend to speak with his accent and then he would copy and it was silly, stupid and innocent. My mom told me I was being really inconsiderate and how uncool it was to make fun of someone for not being able to speak English. I felt terrible. The next day at school my friend came up to me and started joking with me again but I just shook my head and looked down at my desk in embarrassment. He had no idea what was wrong and I was too young and dumb to be able to explain my behavior to him.\n\nAs I grew older I spent probably 20 years thinking about that day and how much of a shit I was to be friendly one day and then without explaining anything just stop talking to him out of embarrassment. I felt really bad about it for a long time and often laid awake at night thinking about it. I ended up finding him on Facebook about a year ago and we friended each other so I told him how bad I felt about it and apologized. He just laughed it off and said it was no big deal and he was still really thankful to find someone as friendly as me when he didn't know anyone here. He said he figured my mom had said something to me about it and it never bothered him.\n\nI don't know if maybe he was just being nice to me or not, but it was such a relief to hear it. It really felt like a weight had been lifted off of me.",

            "comment": "For most of my education,  I went to public school and like most kids, I was socially awkward. For High School, I received an academic scholarship to a private Catholic school. it was a really big deal for my family.  I didn't know anyone at the new school. between an odd combination of academics, sports and the tail end of puberty, I became very popular in this new school. I wasn't used to the attention and it definitely got to my teenage head.  Nearly all of my social circles became around the new school and not with my old local friends.  \n\n  \n\nI'm in my junior year, I head to a McDonalds for lunch with a few friends from the new school. working the counter, I see a girl who i used to go to public school with that I used to have a crush on. She just lit up when she saw me, she was so excited, and I ... I was a shitty teenager and I just ignored her. I pretended I didn't recognize her. She looked so deflated when I didn't acknowledge her.   \n\n  \n\nNote this was the 90's.  My family moved a few times after that. I settled down in a different part of the country after University.  I never made it back to that town.  I've relived that asshole moment for years now. Fast forward to one of those nights when I relive that moment, and I decide to look her up on Facebook to apologize. I find out she died 10 years ago in an auto accident.  since I found out her fate, I feel even more awful about that moment.",

If anything, it was a passing, small feeling of loneliness. Don't beat yourself up over it, the fact you even looked her up to apologize -- that gesture -- is kind enough to cancel out the action (times 10). All we can do in life is to move on and learn from our mistakes, especially those we make when we're younger.",

This was dumb for a few reasons:\n\n1. I just had a bad experience with anti-depressants in high school but apparently could only see my own perspective.\n2. It was just a class to teach public speaking methods and I did not need to pick such a heavy topic.\n3. Somehow I was so self-absorbed I could not register the weird looks I was getting from people, and when a classmate said \"well that was ballsy\" to me after class I did not understand.\n4. I was a Psychology major and I should know better (and I do now).\n\nAnyway that one stabs at me.  I also made a presentation in my sociology class while semi-high which was supposed to be about myself and my relationship to society and I included a bunch of weird \"modeling\" pictures and stuff about my \"eclectic\" music taste.  Oh I'm so special I like Missy Elliott *and* Tom Waits.  Is that what this is about?   Anyway I am going to bury my own head now.",

I meant both of those but it didn't matter. The teacher was seriously hurt by it, although she pretended it was nbd at first. Then as the weeks went by she would mention it once a week, gradually seeming more and more upset. Until one day, when another student mentioned being scared to ask her about something, she shouted at him for an entire period. She also mentioned me a bunch, saying she would never forget what I said but could forgive me.\n\nAnyways, she was the type of teacher to really consider her students to be her own kids and I guess me being scared of her hurt her.

The Maths teacher started our first class by asking each of us about our education background (what school we came from, what they taught in our last year's Maths class etc.), just trying to get a general idea of what kind of students he was dealing with.\n\nThing is, I was so nervous that I spaced out for a bit and got lost in my overthinking mind, so I didn't hear the teacher's questions to my classmates. When it got to my turn, the teacher just said \"Now tell me about you\", assuming I understood what kind of information he was expecting. I just went straight into a monologue that started with \"So I was born in the South Zone of the city, but my mom decided to move to our current neighborhood a few months after divorcing my dad...\" And went on and on giving some very specific details about my short life. Everyone had a really confused look on their faces and as soon as I realized the teacher was also completely lost I stopped talking and went instantly red.\n\nThe teacher then said \"that's all really great, but I was only interested in what happened last year, not the last 10...\", and everyone started laughing. \n\nNext day nobody remembered it anymore, but 12 years later it still comes to mind in pretty random moments.\n\nEdit: a typo.",

We happen on a bus stop with couple of girls seemingly our age. We stopped and tried to chat them up, but their bus came soon after and they had to go.\n\nWe see their bus stop at a traffic light not 20 metres away and one of us says \"Let's run to the next stop\". Nobody thought to ask \"Then what?\" and off we were, sprinting madly behind the bus.\n\nSurprisingly enough, we somehow made it to the next stop just as the bus was arriving. Then the doors opened, the girls sat there giggling and...\n.\n.\n.\nWe did nothing. Literally. I even remember it like the bus driver held the doors a bit longer, but I might as well might be imagining it as the memory is so old. We just sat there, trying to catch our breaths as my lungs burned. \n\nAnd then the doors closed and the bus went off to the next stop. And none of us said anything. We just walked it off, went on to the next stupid shit we would do. \n\nI don't know about any of the other guys, but this still haunts me as one of the cringiest moments of my life so far.",

I decided I\u2019d try to hold it out longer. My parents told me to tell someone when it was emergency should I be in that situation tho. Finally, I was about ready to burst. I raised my hand again, I was doing that piss dance kids do. I say with so much desperation \u201cPLEASE, teacher, it\u2019s an emergency. I NEED to go.\u201d\n\nShe says, \u201cno. There\u2019s only ten minutes left. You can wait.\u201d\n\nPisssd myself two seconds later. I didn\u2019t know it back then, but I seethe at how I was treated by that teacher now. I was SEVEN.

My tiny 5 year old bladder was not having it though, so I started to walk up to the lab monitor (not my usual teacher at least) and was told everyone with their hands up had to wait their turn. So it went back to my seat and waited as she continued to SLOWLY make her way through kids. Back then we needed buddies to go anywhere so I was worried about being allowed to leave without someone with me. Well, eventually I couldn't wait anymore.\n\nI remember being escorted to the front office and them giving me a spare pair of pants they had around to change into. They were jeans, too big, and I remember being so uncomfortable because I had to wear them without underwear.\n\nEventually my mom came to bring me a change of clothes, and my parents made sure to make it VERY clear to me that it didn't matter what an adult said if it was an emergency. And hey, at least no one made fun of me either.",

Well if you\u2019re one of the last kids in the lunch line you have much less time to eat and no time to use the bathroom.  That poor girl ended up peeing her pants and was so embarrassed. My heart broke for her.  Then this damn teacher sent her to the nurses office to call her parents for clean clothes. No one was home and she had to stay that way for the next few hours and ride the bus home that way.  What really is frustrating is after the teacher sent her to the nurses office she told all of us to line up because we were all now going to use the bathroom and she didn\u2019t want to hear anyone say they didn\u2019t have to go, that wasn\u2019t an option.  I don\u2019t remember the girl ever being bullied or picked on for it. I think everyone felt compassion for her.  I was bullied in school and it messes you up!  I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.  I just don\u2019t understand people sometimes.",

Bad teachers, particularly in elementary school, are the worst because they have a tremendous amount of power with very little accountability.  The principal or admin can\u2019t watch every class and kids often don\u2019t know what is inappropriate enough to tell their parents about.",

One day we had to do a paper describing ourselves coming back from summer break and the class had to put a person to a description. \n\nI named my favorite jacket that I wore every day \u201cTakeshi\u201d for fuck knows why, and the cutest new girl in the class read my description out loud and in it I described the love for my jacket and how I had named it was it is. The cute girl looks weirded out, stares at the class and goes, \u201cwhat weirdo names their jacket?\u201d \n\nOnce no one guessed who it was I piped up and said \u201cWell maybe they aren\u2019t here today?\u201d Trying to cover myself. My dumbass forgot though that this was an IN CLASS ASSIGNMENT. And the teacher said, \u201cNo it had to have been written by someone here?\u201d Finally one of my friends goes, \u201cHey XXXX aren\u2019t you like the only one in class who plays soccer?\u201d(also written in my description) \n\nI sunk in my seat as we moved on to the next description.... i wake up sweating feeling that jacket still on my shoulders...\n\nEDIT: Really did not expect the attention and upvotes on one of my most remembered cringey moments... Please stop upvoting before the cute girl in class recognizes me...",

I guess they thought I was telling this girl I was so sick of her...   I had no clue at the time though, so I just let it ride. :(  Still feel bad about that one.",

I asked him if he'd go with me, as friends, but somehow the wires got crossed and he thought I was actually asking him out.\n\nAfter work one day, he asked if he could talk to me and he went into this long speech about how he has a girlfriend and he loves her very much and he can't disrespect her by going to the dance with me. All of that was fine--I wasn't mad or anything--except I'm a stress-laugher, and it struck me as funny that he thought I wanted to date him when the reality was that I didn't want to date anyone except ThE lOvE oF mY lIfE. Of course, all of that is difficult to explain as a mature adult, let alone a 17-year-old girl, so I just laughed.\n\nI think about it sometimes and think to myself about how ridiculous the whole situation was and I wish I could go back and explain it to my ex-coworker...but I can't even remember his first name.",

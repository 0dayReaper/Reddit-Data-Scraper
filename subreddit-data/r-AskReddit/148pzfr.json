A group of guys offered me a a lift home and then got forceful, pushing me into the back of their car. They drove just outside my house and then sped off with me still in the back. The driver started laughing and said \u201cyou didn\u2019t think we\u2019d let you go did you? Your coming back to ours and we\u2019re going to take turns with you.\u201d I panicked, I begged them to get me out. Eventually, the guy in the passenger seat managed to convince his mates to let me out the car - I ran home and didn\u2019t look back. Obviously I should have been more cautious and not engaged in conversation with them in the first place, however I couldn\u2019t have predicted that would happen! I was about 24 at the time, and used to being approached (and more) by guys but this was a very close call!",

Students learn about how ingredients interact with one another under different conditions, they learn about nutrition, they learn about technology in food (ranging from how UHT works to GMOs to drones in agriculture), about ethics in the food industry, food security, marketing, sustainability, etc. It's a huge subject. In their last couple of years they can choose to do a subject that is focused on cooking and the hospitality industry but they can also choose more academic subjects around food and/or health so up until then we cover all the stuff they need to know and be capable of doing to go either way. Kids fresh into high school start super basic and make a couple of very easy things with the real purpose of teaching them to be safe, work both independently and with others, write and follow a plan based on a recipe, and clean up properly. It's also when we start teaching them why they need to use brown vs white sugar and keep eggs out of the fridge for baking, etc.  At my school it's mandatory in their first year and after that they can choose.\n\nEdit: since everyone is asking about the eggs. If you have room temperature butter and then add cold eggs, the fat in your butter is going to be unhappy and get cold. If you've ever creamed butter and sugar together only for it to go lumpy once you add eggs, it's probably because the eggs were too cold. The effect this has on a cake is that it ends up denser than it should be. If it happens, trying folding some flour through the mixture but not too much. If the recipe says the butter is room temperature, your eggs probably should be too.",

The theory is a bit easier sure but my god you have to work so hard in that subject, with science once you get it it's actually not nearly as much work it's just here's a question now solve it.\n\nI'd argue home ec teaches you way more skills you'd use in the workplace.

Then, after I got my costuming degree, I looked into teaching Home Ec kind of sewing stuff, and there\u2019s next to nothing here, too. And when I looked at volunteering to teach these sort of classes (how to fit clothing you\u2019ve bought, how to lengthen or shorten hems and sleeves, what makes a good piece of clothing worth investing in versus something cheap not worth the effort, how to clean clothes... you get the idea) I got basically told those aren\u2019t skills kids need. \n\nWhich is dumb as hell. No matter how much money you have, if you don\u2019t buy good clothes and if you don\u2019t spend money fitting them or know how to do it yourself, you\u2019ll look like a schlub. Plus, who knows? Quilting might become someone\u2019s hobby or passion just for having tried it.",

So many young people coming out of school with very few skills or practical knowledge. It used to be so common to have home ec classes and they\u2019ve stopped them most places. I was on the cusp when they had just stopped but we still had other practical courses like woodworking, parenting, etc. You can see a drastic difference in today\u2019s younger adults and teenagers with very few home skills because so many in my generation don\u2019t know how to teach these skills.

It should be much lighter in color.\n\nBrown sugar adds some moisture. \n\nAlways use butter. Real if possible\n\nChilling the dough has always been a battle for me. I do chill the dough for like 30 min, I used to chill the dough overnight. I don't see much of a difference in the two. But you should chill it for at least 30 min. \n\nI always start with 2 min less baking time then recommended, and check on them. As soon as the edges have even a little color I take them out to cool as they will still bake for a couple minutes. \n\nAlways the middle rack. Not top or bottom. \n\nDon't over mix when combining wet and dry ingredients. \n\nSift your dry ingredients (I never do this cause I'm too lazy, but it does help) \n\nCool them on a rack.\n\nEdit: omg thank you for the silver, my first award ever!!!",

Also that teacher would hunt/fish on weekends so showed us how to butcher our own cuts from a larger piece of whole beef and how to boil fresh caught crabs (on a stove outside because the smell was really awful, like low tide on steroids.) I\u2019ve never done the butchering or crab boil since then but I definitely got confident enough to improvise a meal out of whatever I happened to have on hand.",

Our HS cut home ec courses like, 2 years before i got there, so i can't even operate a sewing machine.\n\nFood science is so fascinating to me, but i don't really have the money to go back to school to learn it practically.

Not only did our high school still have home ec, but I ended up joining a program for \"troubled youth\" (I wasn't troubled, but if I was in the program I could surpass other graduation requirements and graduate several years early), and they very much focused on real world application. Instead of a math class it was how to calculate your taxes, balance a checkbook, make a finance schedule. Instead of social science it was straight up \"here's how to cut up vegetables. Here's how to make a soup so you can survive\". It was a pretty sad last few months of high school, and those kids did not give a single fuck. I don't think trying to teach anyone something they don't want to learn is going to go well. One of the kids from that thing did end up being a solid chef, so maybe the home ec stuff worked?",

It doesn't matter if you remember who Charlemagne was or what a gerund is. You are there to learn how to learn and to provide a basic layer onto which you can add that knowledge.\n\nSo, you come out of school and you've got the broad strokes of history. You remember a few things, most of it is forgot, but when you watch a movie that is set in the past it's not some completely alien concept. You've got a rough idea of what is going on.\n\nYou don't need to remember Euclid's axioms or how to solve a quadratic equation but you now have math-sense. You use basic math intuition all the time, because you got the fundamentals in school, whether you remember the details or not. \n\nOh, and this is the perfect place to talk about English! For whatever reason, redditors have decided, for the most part, to type in full sentences with the right punctuation on either end. You only rarely see people using txt speech or that broken language so common on numerous other sites. The same lessons above hold true for the literature side though. It doesn't matter if you remember every last book on which you had to write an essay; the point is that you now have the bones of a shared culture. When you see yet another Hollywood starlet is getting a turn as yet another Jane Austen character, there's a chance you'll watch it. \n\nIn any case, yes. If schools are still doing their job, figuring out how to do your taxes should not be too difficult. If you ever need help from an accountant, it's because you've made so much money that you can actually afford their services.",

My gym class happened to just have the girls 9th grade but the boys 9th grade teacher, it was his block hour where they got a break to catch up on paperwork, so there were no 9th grade boys that we shared activities with. That class was the hardest working, most fit class of all her classes. The same girls who the year before acted like they couldn't do things cause oh no, cant let the boys see me being physical, were running further, punching harder, lifting more weight without worrying about their Male peers watching. \n\nPre-teens/teens are so obsessed with their gender counterparts that they slide into gender norms to try to \"fit in\" right with them and get attention. \n\nI firmly believe that some more stereotypical gendered things should be separated at this age to prevent this. All boys home ec. All girls shop. Gym classes separated. It would widen their perspectives on that stuff without the peer pressure of conforming or not.",

Sure, it's a bit of effort, but I've personally found that the barrier to doing chores is less knowledge of how do do them and more the lack of it being an instilled habit. Most chores are pretty simple and can be taught in 5-15 minutes. Good cleaning and tidying habits take a long time of dedicated necessity.\n\nSource: My parents were very chore light on me and while I know how to do it all, I don't have that habit of routine house upkeep that I know others do. My brother is even worse and barely even clears out his own desk once a month.",

She was tied to an air tank. His parents were dead and his Grandfather died 3 years prior. This was his life, along with his classes and studying and also just being a nerdy teenage dude.\n\nI only know all this because one day I saw him crying under the bleachers after school, and just sat with him. I was waiting for my GF to finish Cheerleading and we split a four loko from a 7/11 nearby (the dude didn't know they were alcoholic, they were that new) and I got him (maybe) into Mastodon as he talked. \n\nHe moved schools the next month and I never heard from him again. I assume he went to live with distant relatives since I saw her name in the obits. Jason if you're out there and see this...I want my fucking Crack the Skye CD back!",

Wednesdays were 2nd,4th, and 6th periods also extended. Three Wednesdays of the week, we had \"Access\", which took up the last \"class of the day. It way basically a free period for the entire school. You could go to teachers in their main classroom if you needed their help with classwork/homework, you could study/get caught up on any classwork or homework that you were behind on, or do anythi9ng else that you wanted to. The only thing you couldn't do was leave campus because it was still considered school time. The remaining week was just a short day where you got to go home immediately after 6th period. It really helped just about everyone get better grades. Most people did better in school because they got to study with teachers one-on-one or in small groups of 5 or so students at their own pace. Others took some much needed relaxing time away from both homework and home.\n\nEdit: We also had 7 hour school days, from 8:30 to 3:30.",

            "comment": "Schools have these already and the kids in them don't care. It's not immediately relevant to their lives so they don't pay attention. Sorta like if I were to talk to you about the do's and don'ts of denture cream. You say, \"eh, I'll figure it out later when I need to know it\" and stop paying attention.\n\nI've taught in several schools that have tried to teach social skills, kindness, meditation, financial literacy, etc. In every case, the kids did not care. It was their least favorite part of the day because it felt like a waste of time.\n\nThe point of education is to teach thinking, not doing. A well-educated student can teach themselves these things. A quick Google search can teach you how to file taxes, cook, etc. But you can't Google how to do Algebra 2 and expect to understand what you read without some background in the subject matter.\n\nEdit: I got upvotes? Now I'm mad with power, so I'll say this: \n\nI hear arguments like this post all the time, and I think the real issue is people not taking responsibility. \"I can't cook? That must be the school's fault! We need education reform!\" No, it's not the school's fault. It's your fault. You could literally Google a recipe in 20 seconds. Stop blaming other people for your problems.\n\nPeople don't realize that the point of education isn't to teach facts, but the change your brain. For example, physics and math majors earn the highest scores in the MCAT, GMAT, and LSAT. It's not because they learned those things in class, but because their curriculum emphasizes logical thinking. When students slack in schoolwork, they're not just missing out on the opportunity to know stuff; they're missing out on the opportunity to be smarter.",

But education forces you to do stuff like read and write a lot or practice a lot of math problems. Those tasks help develop the brain and develop critical thinking skills. \n\nEven undergrad programs in engineering are not really meant to retain knowledge. They are meant to wire the brain to think like an engineer. Most of your knowledge in engineering is going to come from training you receive in industry and just working in projects in industry.",

Get your prescriptions filled?\" It boggles the mind that kids would be willing to sit their ass in a chair at school for hours to passively listen to this, while \"adulting\" simly means that you take the time to look it up yourself and learn on your own. Since you are \"adulting\", you get to decide how much time you want to spend on any of these things.\n\nLearning to cook does not mean you have to become a chef, it just means you can feed yourself reasonably nutritious food that you enjoy eating. You can go all out and learn to bake a fancy quiche if you enjoy it, or just learn to fry a couple of eggs in two minutes. You decide, and have the power over how you want to feed yourself.\n\nIt's ok if you don't want to learn to do your taxes, although if you only have one job and don't have properties or business, it can be so straightforward that it's probably worth learning to do on your own in a couple of hours.\n\nThere's no need to buy a sewing machine to alter your clothes unless you think you would enjoy it as a permanent hobby, but anyone can spend a couple of dollars on a cheap sewing kit and look up how to sew a button, because it only takes a few minutes and it does come in handy. Totally fine to wait until your button falls off.\n\nThere are no prescribed items you must know to be an adult, you just have to do the best you can with what you have, and that often means learning something new on your own when needed, and you get to decide how to do it.",

Washing clothes, follow the instruction manual. Cooking? Watch YouTube, follow a recipe. What these all have in common is that you need a solid grasp on numeracy and literacy. These are things that must be explicitly taught. These are the core skills that underpin almost everything. People who complain about not being taught how to do their taxes tend to have shitty numeracy skills. People who struggle to fill out a form tend to have shitty literacy. Can't read instructions? Literacy issue. You can make education as practical as possible but the fact is: many don't want to learn, until it's too late. I say this as a teacher: we really do a lot to make education as relevant to real-world needs as possible but there is not getting around the fact that a person must learn to be fluent in both reading and writing, as well as be able to think mathematically to cope in the \"real world\". The rest of what we do is for the purpose of teaching you how to learn effectively, how to think in different ways, how to adapt to unfamiliar challenges and how to deal with abstract ideas. We don't teach the model of the atom because you need to know where the elections go. We teach you so that you can learn how to grasp concepts that are not directly observable, make logical conclusions from them and apply abstract ideas to real-world phenomena. The actual topics are just vehicles for these skills",

If it bit you, you'd suffer the consequences of the spider bite. Depending on the radiation source, one of three things could happen regarding that:\n\n\\- Radioactive material enters the bloodstream through the wound site. If it was an alpha or beta emitter, your cells would be ionised. You wouldn't be at risk if it were a relatively non-dangerous source, but you probably would be as it would cause cell damage. Beta rays can also cause radiation burns on the skin, so are quite a risk to you.\n\n\\- Were it a gamma emitter, there's a risk of cancer forming. The longer you are near the spider, the higher the chance - though it's pretty low if you're not around it for long.\n\n\\- Absolutely nothing, and you've got lucky, as it's neither a gamma emitter nor has entered the bloodstream.\n\nSo yeah, you'd have to get an antivenom and potentially treatment for radiation sickness. Nothing all that fun, I'm afraid.",

She thought items could touch and even be stacked. Often she\u2019d have something block the path of the upper sprinkler,  so it couldn\u2019t spin. I always had to rewatch the dishes. \nShe also thought cleaning meant stuffing any clutter into drawers and closets, regardless of where anything actually belonged. A room could look tidy, but behind every closet door and in every drawer was a mess of unimaginable dimensions.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold and all the upvotes \u2014 all y\u2019all made my day!

I clean his home for him a few times a year and go through each item. I have baskets and boxes laid out for thrift store, metal scrap yard, stuff I \u201cwant\u201d aka will be secretly thrown out... I just wanted you to know that if she gives you stuff, it is her way of letting go of things. It can be very difficult mentally for hoarders to give up these items because they think it may have a use later or they over-inflate its importance. Knowing that it is going to a good home helps them let go.",

We were chilling with the roomates and I  had to pee so I went to the now clean bathroom, but there was very little toilet paper and no spare rolls in sight! Went back to the den area and asked where I might find some, he just sort of shrugged and was like \"I don't know.\" His roomates just stared at him. One if the roomates found a roll somewhere so I could pee and not have to wipe with the cardboard roll, and I left a short time later. We dated for a few months, and I think this was a pretty solid indication of his lazy, inconsiderate interior under a charming, romantic exterior.",

Although I did have to replace the transmission a few years after that because I screwed that all to hell by dropping the Jeep off a four foot embankment while mud bogging.

It\u2019s not so much WHAT someone reads so long as they show an interest in learning, expanding their minds, and enjoying a good story.  Seeing their bookshelf can tell you a lot about what interests they have and the interests you share. You don\u2019t have to like the same books at all - in fact I love the idea of sharing my favorite books with someone who\u2019s never read them (but will hopefully enjoy them) and vice verse.",

He poured out his life's savings (all 3 years of it) to buy the thing but fuck it he was a young delivery driver it's not THAT insane. Well it's definitely a little bit crazy but it's not full on coocoo for coacoa puffs.\n\n\nAnyway, Bob was actually quite a hit with the ladies despite being a normal looking guy of humble means. Not that he didn't have an enjoyable personality but the women he was hooking up with were always drop dead gorgeous. Not to come off like an incel but the math just wasn't adding up and, being more than a little envious, I asked what the hell was his secret?\n\n\nTurns out Bob had been going to the atm at the bank and digging through trash cans looking for anything with a big number on it. He'd take it, write his number on the back and hand them out to beautiful women at bars. Of course only a certain kind of woman responds to that kind of advance and it hit me, this mother fucker was fishing for gold diggers. They call him and he shows up in his fancy ass car and they're sold.\n\n\nI appreciate that the whole adventure is rather morally dubious but I firmly believe turnabout is fair play.",

Add:\n\n- some extra virgin olive oil\n- add some salt\n\nRemix everything.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nWorks best with short pasta such as Penne. Doesn\u2019t work well on linguine or spaghetti. Even less Capellini. But it\u2019s still good.\n\nExcellent both cold and hot. So if you feel extra lazy, and proactively foresee that the following day you\u2019ll want to be lazy again, just do a bigger portion and leave the rest in the fridge.\n\nThe only thing you\u2019ll want to do is to take it out of the fridge a couple ou hours earlier so that it\u2019s back to ambient temperature.\n\nAnother lazy pasta dish that works extremely well:\n\n- just add some extra virgin olive oil\n- tiny tomatoes cut in 4\n- salt\n\nEnjoy.\n\nThis however works only very well if you\u2019re living in a place with exceptionally good Oil and Tomatoes. So basically only if you live in Spain, Portugal, Italy or Greece (or any country with same level of tomatoes and Oil). If you live in countries further north (or equivalent), it will taste like shit. Trust me",

If you want to be fancy, you can add some carrot to the onion, and add some basil at the end. You could also add some parmesan cheese to the spaghetti, if you want.\n\nAnother very common option is tuna sauce, the procedure is almost the same, only you don't add carrots and basil, but you put tuna instead (and, if you like, some olives).\n\nRagu sauce (which heathens call \"bolognese\") is usually used with tagliatelle, not spaghetti.",

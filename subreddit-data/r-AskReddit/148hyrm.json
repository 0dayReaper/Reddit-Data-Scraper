And Alberta on the west.. well, that\u2019s basically Texas.\n\nBut across the board, we share many similarities. And I think certain politics topics like anti-Trumpism are overblown, although I still doubt 46% of this country would vote for a figure like Trump. We have a lot of MAGA types as you move further and further away from the big cities as well.\n\nConservative views exist, and that\u2019s normal and fair. I think everyone is entitled to their own views and opinions. We have our share of covid-deniers, anti-vaxxers, rights advocates, anti-abortionists, etc., just probably less extreme. A lot of people seem to see Canada (as well as other European countries) as super liberal bastions when really I think we are just slightly more reasonable. The biggest thing though is that we probably aren\u2019t as bible-thumping and religion plays less of a role in our lives. We do not hold the constitution as the end-all-be-all with very outspoken views on 2nd amendment rights. And we definitely do not recite a pledge of allegiance before each start of the school day which I find a bit offputting for a modern, democratic, Western country.",

If our healthcare, food choices, traffic, people, cleanliness, and *weather* are worse than Canada, why spend the money and time to travel to the opposite end of the continent? The driving part is particularly troubling, since we Floridians aren't exactly known for our obeyance of traffic laws - but we at least know that you don't go 20 under the limit in the fast lane before swerving through three lanes of traffic with no indicator. If it were just Quebec I'd give you a pass, but I'm seeing a lot of Ontario plates down here right now, and it's making our already Mad Max-esque traffic issues significantly worse. \n     \n     \nWe are a state devoted to tourism as our source of income and I can say without hesitation or reservation that we'd rather you lot just vacation somewhere closer to your natural environment.

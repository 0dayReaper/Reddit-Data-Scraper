I really don\u2019t see myself (Vancouver) too different from Californians and those living in Seattle, Portland (especially Portland), etc.\n\nI\u2019m sure those living in Toronto are more similar to those in New York.. and those in the coast provinces probably have more in common with those in Maine.\n\nWe don\u2019t have much to compare with the American South though, I think. And Alberta on the west.. well, that\u2019s basically Texas.\n\nBut across the board, we share many similarities. And I think certain politics topics like anti-Trumpism are overblown, although I still doubt 46% of this country would vote for a figure like Trump. We have a lot of MAGA types as you move further and further away from the big cities as well.\n\nConservative views exist, and that\u2019s normal and fair. I think everyone is entitled to their own views and opinions. We have our share of covid-deniers, anti-vaxxers, rights advocates, anti-abortionists, etc., just probably less extreme. A lot of people seem to see Canada (as well as other European countries) as super liberal bastions when really I think we are just slightly more reasonable. The biggest thing though is that we probably aren\u2019t as bible-thumping and religion plays less of a role in our lives. We do not hold the constitution as the end-all-be-all with very outspoken views on 2nd amendment rights. And we definitely do not recite a pledge of allegiance before each start of the school day which I find a bit offputting for a modern, democratic, Western country.",

Ran out of my heart meds, so I tried going to the public cliniques  was there at 9 and was there too late.  You have to get there and camp out in line hours before it opens to get  your name on a list it turns out.\n\nI said fuck this shit, made an appointment with a private clinic. Had an appointment in 4 days, was on time, so was the doctor 30 minutes later had my script for meds. Best 200$ I ever fn spent, and the place was busy. But it ran like how it is suppose to run.",

By the time he got a new hip, his other hip was ruined and they put him on another waiting list for a few more years. He died before he got his second hip transplant. He spent the last decade of his life in tremendous pain and could barely walk because he couldn't get the care he needed. But hey, it was \"free\".\n\nThe American healthcare system is horrible, but Canada's is just as bad. Just in a different way.",

Check out public pharmaceutical profit margins - they're actually fairly reasonable, despite the astronomical price tags charged to US consumers to make up for low caps elsewhere.\n\nYou're able to wax ideological about immigration because you're a continent away from any impoverished groups that would try to sneak into your country - you scold the US while letting it absorb all of the issues associated with poverty, desparation, and cartel violence.\n\nOverall, you are a caricature of the \"limousine liberal\" who's happy to propose liberal solutions while being completely insulated from the practical fallout.",

If our healthcare, food choices, traffic, people, cleanliness, and *weather* are worse than Canada, why spend the money and time to travel to the opposite end of the continent? The driving part is particularly troubling, since we Floridians aren't exactly known for our obeyance of traffic laws - but we at least know that you don't go 20 under the limit in the fast lane before swerving through three lanes of traffic with no indicator. If it were just Quebec I'd give you a pass, but I'm seeing a lot of Ontario plates down here right now, and it's making our already Mad Max-esque traffic issues significantly worse. \n     \n     \nWe are a state devoted to tourism as our source of income and I can say without hesitation or reservation that we'd rather you lot just vacation somewhere closer to your natural environment.

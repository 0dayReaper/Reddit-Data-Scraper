Dont focus on it and keep approaching someone you like. yes you are going to get rejected, but you want the ONE that is not shallow enough and give you a chance.\n\nIf you go around with a depressed head down attitude, then that's what you are going to attract. head up smile and be a decent person. If you approach 100 people and the 101 becomes your partner then the other 100 did not deserve you.",

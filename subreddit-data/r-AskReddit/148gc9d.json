            "comment": "When my dad was carrying me as we swam at the beach one day as a kid.  Got pulled like a mile out from the shore thanks to the tides, and naturally I started freaking the fuck out since I couldn\u2019t swim \n\nMy dad remained totally cool and levelheaded the whole time, and just told me to kick my legs while holding onto him. He also told me in the moment that in a situation like that, NEVER swim against the tides. No idea how long it took but eventually we made it back fine.  \n\nIt still impresses me to think about how stoic he was in that moment, but he used to be an avid swimmer &amp; sailor before I was born so he was extremely confident in the water",

I had one of those passes for anxiety that allows you to step outside for 5 minutes so I used it and was trying to calm down outside when I noticed a girl crouching down coughing. I asked her if she was ok and when she looked up, I saw she had been coughing up blood. Not just a little bit, she was covered in the blood she had been coughing up. She was crying, obviously in intense pain and terrified. I was already stressed from my panic attack but I tried to remain calm so I could help her. I had taken multiple medical \"heartstart\" courses that year so I could was eligible for work experience, so I had some idea of what to do. I called an ambulance because coughing up that much blood is serious. I asked her if she felt pain and she said her leg hurt so much she couldn't move and had to sit on the floor because it was to painful to stand on. I noticed her leg was swollen and red. When the ambulance arrived I was worried I might have wasted their time by calling before getting the school nurse but I'm glad I did because the doctor told me this girl had a life threatening blood clot in her leg and I saved her life by calling. It was terrifying but that was one day I was glad I had a panic attack.",

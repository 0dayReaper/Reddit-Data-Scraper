Essentially 245 Trioxin (the chemical that causes bodies to reanimate as zombies) can be transmitted via air or rainfall. A number of medical cadaver zombies are incinerated and the air goes into the upper atmosphere, mixing with rain and reanimating an entire grave yard (Including a civil war era zombie and a literal skeleton showing you aren't safe unless your dust). It ends with the army nuking the town and inadvertently releasing the chemical all over the world. And the zombies are fast, can set traps, talk and only eat human brains to relieve the pain of being dead.",

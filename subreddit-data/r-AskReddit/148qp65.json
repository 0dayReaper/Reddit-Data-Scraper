He jokingly said you'd have to look very, very close. Didn't realize until I was in my late teens that he was talking about data stored within the chip",

            "comment": "Not my parents but something a trusted adult said that stuck out to me. If it helps, this adult shares the same name with my mom. I was raised very religious and know all the bullshit stigmas, 'No sex before marriage.' 'No kissing before marriage' (though I'm pretty sure that no one will care if I break that now.' 'No gays.' etc. One time though, my youth pastor said the equivalent to, 'It is wrong to get back together with a boy after breaking up.' I got sad, because the kids shows I'd watch would usually have couples get together and break up and get back together again, and I was already said about not getting a first kiss the way TV characters did. What can I say? They were my role models, I wanted their experiences.\n\nPretty soon, I organized it into the 'sins that I don't care to avoid category'. But as time passed, nothing like that was ever brought up again the way other religious stigmas would come up. Until finally, I realized, 'Wait a minute- That's not a thing. Getting back together has never been considered a sin. Why did she-?\"\n\nI realize that it could have just been her giving her personal advice or opinion, which is probably true, but it was that I thought that there was something in the bible adamantly against getting back with an ex that confused me. I guess this also doesn't really count since there's a probably a reasonable explanation lol, and who knows? Maybe there is something in the bible about it, but if so it's likely universally ignored.",

            "comment": "my parents were of a generation where racism was kind of baked in. They didn\u2019t trust people who were different colors, or who weren\u2019t of Abrahamic religions.\n\nBut, they grew up in poverty, and in very non-diverse places. I don\u2019t think it was that they were genuinely against people, so much as it was a fear of the unknown, and a suspicion of other people trying to take advantage of them, because that was very common in their impoverished lives. \n\nas far as I\u2019m concerned, all people are people. You should judge them on their character, not on superficial things.",

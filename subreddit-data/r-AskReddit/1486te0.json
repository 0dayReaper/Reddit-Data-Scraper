I saw her perform in a small club when she was popular but prior to being in movies, I watched her sketch show on Comedy Central, all was good. \n\nThen, something shifted. The tone of her show and of her stand up shifted into being more about having a \"message\" and less about making jokes and being funny. Then, the real nail in the coffin, is that there is absolutely damning evidence of her straight up stealing jokes. Not just premises of jokes, but the entire joke and punch line. Totally lost all respect with that.",

I was actually quite nervous as the last time I saw him live was when he was still doing Good News, and I've largely stopped watching his Hour show. \n\nI feel so fucking vindicated in my theory that his jokes are practically sucked dry for television audiences. He has lawyers who check the jokes over, one of his jokes in his live set was about the lawyers being worried about ISIS getting offended that Russell said they're not real Muslims, to put it into context. \n\nHe intentionally asked all audiences to not film so that the jokes aren't all around the Internet (sorry for spoiling one, lol), and I also think that a part of that is because he wanted a little bit more freedom to deviate from the type of stuff you see in his TV shows. \n\nI personally feel like I've had a six year old question finally answered by going to see him live again. Has he still got it? Abso-fucking-lutely. Haven't laughed that hard in years!",

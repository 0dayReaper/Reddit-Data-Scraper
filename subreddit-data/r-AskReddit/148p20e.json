They even created the DARK BRANDON meme because he slays his opponents and they never see it coming. \n\nThose looking for an example. \n\nState of the Union Speech and shortly afterward budget talks begin. So in his State of The Union, where everyone is supposed to be quiet and just listen or clap.. he knows the Republicans have started to not give a shit and yell, etc..  So he uses this to his advantage.\n\nSo what does he do? After they start yelling. He seizes the moment and goes off script. He mentions Republicans plans to cut Medicare/Medicaid and Social Security in the new budget. They all yell out he is lying. Guess what doesn't get cut that Republicans dearly wanted to cut? \n\nDark Brandon wins in a genius move.",

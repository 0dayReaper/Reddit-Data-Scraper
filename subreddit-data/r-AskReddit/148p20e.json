You may hate him, or his publicity stunts, or how he got famous.

I don\u2019t like giving them the clicks or feeding their algo or however you wanna say it these days but what they did and do worked and continues to work. Crazy effective actually. Especially for someone who effectively got famous for doing idiotic stuff with his brother and being willing to do any publicity stunt that would get him the clicks and the attention to sell enough ads over the years to get them where they are today. Craziness. Great comment I never would\u2019ve been able to add him to the mix myself but really is one of the best answers I came across!",

They even created the DARK BRANDON meme because he slays his opponents and they never see it coming. \n\nThose looking for an example. \n\nState of the Union Speech and shortly afterward budget talks begin. So in his State of The Union, where everyone is supposed to be quiet and just listen or clap.. he knows the Republicans have started to not give a shit and yell, etc..  So he uses this to his advantage.\n\nSo what does he do? After they start yelling. He seizes the moment and goes off script. He mentions Republicans plans to cut Medicare/Medicaid and Social Security in the new budget. They all yell out he is lying. Guess what doesn't get cut that Republicans dearly wanted to cut? \n\nDark Brandon wins in a genius move.",

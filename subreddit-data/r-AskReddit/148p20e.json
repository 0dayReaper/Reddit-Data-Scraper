IIRC He also was not great at practical things such as tying his shoe or remembering directions. Today we might understand differently about that.",

So he uses this to his advantage.\n\nSo what does he do? After they start yelling. He seizes the moment and goes off script. He mentions Republicans plans to cut Medicare/Medicaid and Social Security in the new budget. They all yell out he is lying.

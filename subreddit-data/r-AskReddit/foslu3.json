Hence,\u00a0H. salminicola\u00a0provides an opportunity for understanding the evolutionary transition from an aerobic to an exclusive anaerobic metabolism.\"",

I don\u2019t know much about Ethiopian military but Egypt gets over a billion dollars a year in military aid from the USA and have the largest standing army on the continent?\n\nEdit: wow this got a lot of attention. To clarify I was talking hypothetically. As some good commenters have pointed out an actual ground conflict between the two seems unlikely as Egypt would have to either get the permission of Sudan and S. Sudan to move troops through their nations or would have to invade them as well. \n\nThanks for all the great responses!",

Sudan has publicly admitted they want the dam now. \n\nEgypt doesn\u2019t have the logistic resources or numbers to run a multi-day campaign over 1,500 miles of hostile territory.\n\nEthiopia has high-tech military machinery that\u2019s advanced enough to repulse any land or air-missile attack imposed by Egyptian military. If Egypt\u2019s military forces tampered with the dam heavily funded by China and Italy, Ethiopia could easily retaliate very harshly by blowing up their Aswan dam, washing 95% of Egypt into the sea and putting Cairo underwater... \n\nAnd trust me, the west won\u2019t sit back and watch a predominantly Christian country take a beaten by a Muslim one. \n\nEgypt= Muslim country\n\nEthiopia= predominantly Orthodox Christian, with an ancient Ethiopian Jew population that has significant ties backed and supported by Israel.",

[ Comet C/2019 Atlas Y4 is brightening really quickly](https://astronomy.com/news/observing/2020/03/comet-atlas-may-soon-be-visible-to-the-naked-eye), and by May might be one of the brightest things in the night sky!\n\nI mean, comets are notoriously tricky to predict in brightness, as it might just break apart as it gets closer to the sun.  But it's really exciting to think about, albeit no one has heard about it because of the pandemic (though granted, doesn't a pandemic need a bright comet?).\n\nEdit: you might be able to get it in binoculars right now, or at least have fun trying!  [Here](https://heavens-above.com/comet.aspx?cid=C%2F2019%20Y4&amp;lat=50&amp;lng=15&amp;loc=%C4%8CR&amp;alt=270&amp;tz=CET) is a star chart for it.\n\nAnd yes, the last bright northern hemisphere \"Great Comet\" was Hale-Bopp, which was up for about a year to the naked eye.  If you were a southern hemisphere resident in 2006, however, you probably remember Comet McNaught.\n\nEdit 2: because many are asking, that bright \u201cstar\u201d in the evening sky is actually Venus! It\u2019s around its peak brightness and height *right now* and you should go take a look if your social distancing allows it! Might as well take a break from Netflix and look at a whole \u2018nother planet. :)\n\nEdit 3: no there is no chance of the comet hitting us or affecting life on Earth beyond potentially getting bright.",

Because a second cyclone hit occurred during their breeding cycle, instead of drying out and having most of their population die out in the desert, the population exploded. In favorable conditions they can multiply by 400X their population every 6 months. Then they mass migrated. \n\nAlso for clarity, a swarm was identified as 3 times the size of NYC.",

The modern take on the apocalypse is \"everything goes to shit\" which is not what the original definition meant. The word apocalypse literally means \"unveiling\", and I think that even though we are seeing a quick short term decline, after these trials are over we could very well see humanity rebound from the suffering and leave this age of confusion, hypocrisy, lies, anger, and authoritarianism, and enter an age of truth, love, light, compassion, and understanding.  \n\nAfter the black plague, Europe saw the death of feudalism and the birth of a free peasantry, and eventually the renaissance. Very good things can happen after very hard and painful things have happened. This has shown to be the case countless times in history. And this will not be anywhere near that bad as far as disease outbreaks go. If it's any consolation, I'm saying this as a person with a degree in biology. I'm not trying to spout superstition, but to instead spread an outlook that I feel is extremely valuable in today's day and age.",

Tylee is the child of Lori Vallow and her (third) husband, Joseph Ryan; JJ was adopted by Lori and her (fourth) husband, Charles Vallow, at a young age. (JJ Vallow is the grandson of Charles Vallow's sister, Kay Woodcock; Charles Vallow is JJ's adoptive father, but also his great-uncle. [The family trees on this one are *complex*.](https://s3-assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/03133658/missing-kids-family-02-20.jpg))\n\nBy all accounts, the marriage was a relatively happy one until a couple of years ago, when -- according to Charles Vallow's brother-in-law, Larry Woodcock -- suspicions arose that Lori was having an affair with a man named Chad Daybell. Daybell is a Latter Day Saints author of religious-themed books, including ['dozens of books on apocalyptic events and near-death experiences'](https://usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/12/lori-vallow-chad-daybell-religion-missing-idaho-kids-mom-cult/4721695002/). By all accounts, [Lori became increasingly fixated on religion during this time](https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/documents-lori-vallow-claims-she-was-god-preparing-for-second-coming-of-christ), becoming obsessed with the idea that there would be a second coming in July 2020 and that she was going to be one of a special 144,000 (the latter of which [is in line with LDS teachings that there will be a group of 'high priests' raised to spread the gospel at the End Times](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/77.11?lang=eng); according to court documents, Charles noted that Lori claimed to be a 'translated being who cannot taste death sent by god to lead the 144,000 into the Millennium.'). This led to suspicions that Lori was in a cult. (Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell worked on a podcast for which the production company, Preparing a People, [has released a statement](https://www.preparingapeople.com/) clarifying that they are *not*, in fact, a cult, merely a religious materials production company. That said, they also included the line 'We formally are notifying all Media and individuals to Cease and Desist from mentioning the Preparing a People Event Brand, or our Media company in any negative connection with Chad or Lori Daybell, or their case' -- so to reiterate, that's **the Preparing a People Event Brand, the alleged cult and *definitely* employers of Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell, who are wanted in connection with the disappearance of two children and potentially the murder of three other people.** You can't just threaten strangers to keep your dirty laundry secret, you guys. That's not how the internet works.)\n\nIn February 2019, Charles Vallow [sought a divorce from his wife](https://kutv.com/news/nation-world/case-of-2-missing-kids-grows-to-include-deaths-cult-rumors), as well as a protection order after she -- allegedly, according to his sister -- threatened him with violence if he got in her way. Charles Vallow was shot and killed by Lori Vallow's brother, Alex Cox, in July of 2019. (Before that, Vallow had switched the beneficiary of a $1 million life insurance policy from Lori to his sister Kay, JJ's grandmother. According to Vallow's former lawyer, Steven Ellsworth, Charles had warned him about a perceived danger to his life; Ellsworth reported Charles as saying, ['I'm afraid I'm gonna be killed, and I know who's gonna do it. [...] I'm telling you, Steve, so that if something happens to me, I wanna make sure you let everyone know that something happens, I'm killed, that it's my wife Lori and her brother, Alex Cox.'](https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/source-charles-vallow-removed-lori-vallow-as-1m-life-insurance-beneficiary-in-2019))\n\nCox claimed that it was a case of self-defence, after Vallow attacked him, but the case was never conclusively settled. Shortly after Vallow's death, Lori removed JJ from a school that specialised in the care of autistic children, [claiming that she had found a new job in California and would be moving JJ there.](https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/private-school-officials-say-lori-vallow-withdrew-her-son-after-lying-about-charles-vallows-death)\n\nSo far, all of this has taken place in Arizona. Rather than moving to California, Lori moves the kids to [Rexburg, Idaho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexburg,_Idaho) in August -- where Chad Daybell is located and, it's worth noting, a town that's estimated to be 95% Mormon -- and enrolls JJ and Tylee into school. That's pretty much the last time they're seen.\n\nNow, while this is going on, Chad Daybell is married to his wife, Tammy -- with whom he's been together since 1990, and founded a religious materials publishing company which put out his writings. In October 2019, Tammy Daybell claimed that a masked man [shot at her with 'a paintball gun'](https://www.eastidahonews.com/2019/12/tammy-daybell-reported-a-masked-man-shot-at-her-with-a-paintball-gun-10-days-before-her-suspicious-death/); as she put it: 'I had gotten home and parked in our front driveway. As I was getting stuff out of the back seat, a guy wearing a ski mask was suddenly standing by the back of my car with a paintball gun. He shot at me several times, although I don\u2019t think it was loaded. I yelled for Chad and he ran off around the back of my house.'\n\nTen days after this, Tammy Daybell died of what was assumed to be natural causes. She was buried shortly afterwards, without an autopsy. The police *did* attend the scene but apparently didn't find anything unusual; per Fremont County Sheriff Len Humphries: 'My deputies responded and, as we do with most unattended deaths, they took pictures, they looked it over and contacted our detectives. The detectives had a few questions, they satisfied those, got the information they needed and didn\u2019t see anything that alarmed them. [...] [To my knowledge, he [Daybell] was responding like anybody would whose spouse had just passed away. That\u2019s why the deputies didn\u2019t suspect anything suspicious.'](https://www.eastidahonews.com/2020/01/sheriff-details-what-happened-when-deputies-responded-to-tammy-daybells-death-as-lori-daybells-son-makes-a-passionate-plea-to-his-mother/)\n\nShortly after this -- within weeks -- Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell get married in Kaui, Hawaii. The kids are nowhere to be seen; Tylee allegedly [sent a text to a friend](https://www.postregister.com/news/local/new-texts-show-last-known-contact-from-tylee-ryan-s/article_773770ec-1ba1-5bcf-b037-c778719abb30.html) on October 25th, but that's the last of any sort of contact (and even that isn't necessarily accurate). The Daybells were subject to a welfare check on JJ in November (after family members complained they hadn't seen or heard from him in months), but when the police arrived, the Daybells claimed that JJ was with relatives in Arizona; when they checked up on the story, they found he hadn't stayed with the people the Daybells claimed. When this information comes in, police go to have a talk with the Daybells... and they've gone. Vanished.\n\nThis takes us to November 27th, 2019. Convinced that there's something suspicious going on, police start to take a closer look at Tammy Daybell's death, and her body is exhumed on December 11th so that toxicology tests can be performed. (The results are still pending.) On December 12th, Alex Cox -- Lori's brother, and the man who killed Charles Vallow -- [was found dead in a house in Arizona](https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/details-surrounding-death-of-lori-vallows-brother-emerge) belonging to [a woman he had married in Vegas two weeks earlier](https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/marriage-license-shows-lori-vallows-brother-got-married-2-weeks-before-his-death); the cause of death is unknown, and -- again -- toxicology reports are still pending.)\n\nAnd that's *mostly* where the story sits right now. The Daybells turned up in Hawaii and are refusing to answer questions, and there have been numerous appeals from the Woodcocks asking for information about the kids; the Woodcocks filed for guardianship, which is still pending. Lori Daybell was delivered papers informing her that she was legally required to produce JJ and Tylee to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare or Rexburg Police Department in five days -- a deadline which passed on January 30th. Police in Hawaii have been investigating the Daybells, but at the time of writing no arrests have been made.\n\nThe reason this is getting national attention now is because of a *Dateline* special entitled *Where Are the Children?*, which aired on February 14th. Given the Daybells' continued refusal -- or inability -- to produce Tylee and JJ, you can expect there to be developments on this story in the coming days. This isn't one that's likely to just go away.\n\nLori Vallow [was arrested in Hawaii on February 20th](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/20/lori-vallow-mom-missing-idaho-children-arrested-hawaii/4820242002/) on two felony counts of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children, resisting or obstructing officers, criminal solicitation to commit a crime and contempt of court. Chad Daybell was not arrested.",

China was already heavily impacted, and the cuts were in response to the reduced demand from that country specifically.  Everything that happened afterwards was icing on the cake. \n\nFor reference to just how much China alone fuels the oil industry - the last major boom was -in large part- because of China's industrial revolution (as depicted on this graph:  [https://www.stlouisfed.org/\\~/media/Publications/Regional-Economist/2016/April/lead\\_fig2.jpg?la=en](https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/Publications/Regional-Economist/2016/April/lead_fig2.jpg?la=en) ).

Third step is when someone argues against it you say what you hate children? You don\u2019t want to stop child porn? You don\u2019t like patriotism? Don\u2019t you want to get rid of terrorists and feel safe? \n\nWhenever you hear a politician talking about intentions be very skeptical and it\u2019s probably a good idea to find out what the legislation actually says.\n\nEdit: wow thank you for the silver and all the responses, this really blew up more than I expected, even though I haven\u2019t responded I agree with many comments.

Maybe if we weren't on year 19 of the god damn PATRIOT act, with the TSA still fondling children and stealing things, it'd be a little easier to welcome the idea of some strict controls to help in times of crisis.\n\nBut when the government has decided that \"forever\" is a time of crisis for the purpose of them fucking you over, then it's more difficult to trust them.",

He is compliant and unarmed. The SAS guy asks 'want me to drop this cunt' a couple of times and is told to radio the superior. He does, but you can't hear the response. He then shoots the man.\n\nThere have been stories breaking in the past of other very questionable or fucked up activity by the SAS in Afghanistan, but (as far as I know) that never had video accompanying it.  The video of this encounter confirms there *wasn't* some misunderstanding or panic...just a cold blooded killing.\n\nIf I may wear my tin foil hat for a moment, it's *terribly* convenient for the government and armed forces that this news broke in the middle of this crisis. A lot of people I know either didn't see this break or only read the headline and assumed it was some kind of misunderstanding.\n\nEdit: added link for those interested",

What I\u2019ve heard is that companies that continue to use end-to-end encryption will be stripped of their Section 230 protections (they will then be responsible for any illegal shit found on their platform) which will really fuck up every social networking platform because there\u2019s gonna be illegal shit on there. Companies that comply and remove their e2e encryption will keep their Section 230 protections but essentially open up their platform to a host of security vulnerabilities. As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I should point out that a ton of its supporters seem very uninformed on the benefits of e2e encryption. \n\nIt\u2019s a stupid idea.\n\nEdit: For those wondering why the government is even considering this, its because the bill supporters claim it will \u201cbring child predators to justice.\u201d It\u2019s a stupid idea that won\u2019t work and I honestly don\u2019t see how anyone with the slightest bit of clarity could think otherwise.",

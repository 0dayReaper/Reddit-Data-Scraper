            "comment": "I talked to a flat-earther about my job working for a company that tracks ship locations, routes, and speeds by satellite. We also had ways of monitoring carbon emissions based on fuel consumption and known weather conditions. None of this would work at all if the earth was flat. Not a jot of it. I could only explain the most basic concepts, but it was enough for him to understand and realise that I was right and that he\u2019d been convinced by someone who had no practical experience of the spherical nature of the Earth. I think that\u2019s what really did it - my experience was really tangible. This happens then this happens then we measure this etc etc... no theory, just practice. A bit like showing a child a rock dropping to the ground in order to explain gravity, rather than giving them the whole theoretical shebang. Y\u2019know?\n\nEdit: sorry it\u2019s a bit rambling I\u2019m so damn tired",

                            "comment": "That's a great question, I'll try to explain it as simply as possible:\n\nShips all over the world are travelling certain distances - let's say Ship A travels from Location A to Location B, and Ship X travels from Location X to Location Y. Based on weather conditions and detailed information about the engine type and cargo load, we can calculate that Ship A used Amount A of fuel, and Ship X used Amount X of fuel. When the ships come into port, we check in with them: \n\n\"Ship A, did you use Amount A of fuel?\"\n\"Affirmative.\" \n\"Great, so we'll log your carbon emissions as such-and-such an amount, and you'll need to purchase so-and-so an amount of fuel in-port.\"\n\nFor this calculation to work, the DISTANCE traveled is absolutely KEY. That distance can ONLY be calculated based on the curvature of the earth.\n\nImagine a beach ball, and you draw 2 lines on it, both of the same length, one near the \"equator\" and one near the \"pole\". Now imagine flattening the ball into a flat map: in order to read the map, those distances will actually look very different, because the map needs to be stretched or skewed in order to look flat - THAT is the sort of map a flat-earther would use. You can't have a flat earth that maintains the exact distances travelled that are measured all over the world at any given time. (We are talking about thousands of ships and millions of journeys being tracked to within the metre.)\n\nOur fuel consumption calculations are very good. We can estimate them almost perfectly, based on known factors, and none of these calculations could possibly work if the distance was not absolutely correct. The distance is completely dependent on the fact that the earth is spherical. \n\nIn order for these calculations to remain correct and the earth to be flat, the ships that are moving around the earth at measured speeds and distances would have to somehow \"trick\" us into seeing them move (which we track via multiple technologies, including satellite and something a bit more akin to mobile phone tower pinging technology) at totally different speeds than they actually do, then they would have to calculate what the fuel consumption *would* be (based on the premise that the earth is spherical) and the captains would then have to tell us a lie when they get into port, and also lie to the fuel vendors about how much fuel they need... they'd all have to be \"in on it\" and they'd all have to be mathematical geniuses... coming from all different countries, languages, companies, the very notion is ludicrous and is on par with... well, I won't say it! \n\nIt would require a conspiracy to exist on a level that is not only impossibly complex and mathematically impossible, but it would also require almost every person who works at sea to be both a genius and a liar. Now, I don't mean this in a disparaging way AT ALL - but the average captain of a ship that meets the emissions reporting requirements is just an ordinary bloke with a mid-level education, and there's thousands of them working all over the world at any given moment. These are not evil geniuses. They are middle-aged Greek men who don't like using onboard computers and think EU emissions regs are bad for business. These are analog processes - they can't just be intercepted and \"skewed\" to preserve the lie, it's just math. The only sophisticated tech involved is the tracking technology - and this is not one \"layer\" of tech. It's multiple layers that all sync up with each other, and again: some of this is very analog stuff. \n\nEssentially: the impressive, tech-y, digital stuff (which a conspiracy theorist might see as being compromised) is actually completely dependent on the analog stuff - which can't be faked and relies on thousands of simple working-class seamen reporting what they see on a big metal dial connected to a pipe in a great big rusty old ship. If the tech-y stuff was really compromised in some way, we would know IMMEDIATELY, because none of the numbers would ever match up, and ship captains all over the world would be scratching their heads, running out of fuel, landing in the wrong ports, and nothing you ever ordered on the internet would ever get to you!",

Eventually he said yes to the sphere and I told him that was how big the earth is.       \n\nA few days later he reverted, most of these people aren\u2019t mentally stable, they believe in a lot of conspiracies.   \n\n\nEdit: Corny edit, but  as connoisseur of flat earth content my personal favorite is [Professor Dave](https://www.youtube.com/c/ProfessorDaveExplains/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid) on YouTube. He is a underappreciated dude who just had a Science channel on YouTube and got brigaded by flat earthers for an unrelated video. He made like 6 video responses in total just owning these guys but they eventually gave up. Check it out.",

Some flat earthers hold that the antarctic is a barrier to possibly more land. Which allows increase resources available to the elite few whom control the penguinati (the military force encircling the entire circumference of the spherical disk world to prevent anyone reaching the true antarctic land mass, simultaneously utilizing radar to scan the entire earths circumference to prevent trespassers) . When you 'go to Antarctica' the penguinati tourist and elite conspiracy agents take you to somewhere else in the world that looks like what you expect Antarctica to be, with special towers that relay the GPS coordinates of your location to trick you into believing the world is  a globe.\n\n(actual argument I have heard from flat earth on multiple occasions; minus the penguinati trademark)\n\nEdit: [Flat Earther Reacts To Youtube Comments](https://youtu.be/NkwGb_NCeQ0?t=81)   \nExpansive land past Antarctica.

I garnered a decent following with an account dedicated to flat earth travel photos (an intentionally absurd premise). In that time I learned a quite a bit about the community including how to discern the trolls from the real deal. The majority of legit flat earthers are extremely distrustful of anything the government says or does. These same people are 9/11 truthers, Holocaust deniers, and anti-vaxxers and they connect these conspiracies together. Many of them have also attached flat Earth theory to religion, magic, or mysticism. Before my infiltration I\u2019d always considered conspiracies fun. Like they were the fan fiction of real life. Now they mostly make me sad. For all the phony accounts like mine, there are still plenty of people out there willing to drop a couple of hundred dollars on a flat Earth convention.",

The straps anchored him firmly in place, they were uncomfortable but necessary. The engine burst to life with a roar that burned out all the other audio, the vibrations tore through his body and he felt his body sink back into the seat as the G-Force began to take hold.\n\nThe captain was watching the readouts on the LED displays and monitoring their trajectory as the acceleration began to peel his thoughts away, there was no more room in his brain, it had been filled by pure fear. The boosters grew with greater ferocity as they lifted higher into the sky, the sun beaming down on the left side of the shuttle.\n\nBut faster they went.\n\nThrough max Q and higher into the stratosphere until the engines grew quieter, the air more silent, and the vibrations became less violent. They were approaching space, the final frontier.\n\nAn hour later, and with the path of the shuttle a success he noticed as his raw emotions withdrew that his body felt funny, head hair drifted aimlessly across his eyes as the captains pen hovered in mid air and he knew the impossible was true, his childhood dream, he was in space. Weightless.\n\nThe captain turned around to him, and motioned him to unhook his seatbelts. He did as he was commanded. They both left their chairs and glided over to the tiny glass windows to overlook the magnificence of Earth.\n\n\"What do you think now,\" said the Captain.\n\nHe recoiled in horror, it couldn't be. NASA had replaced the windows with high definition screens in order to perpetrate their lies that the world was spherical. Those bastards.",

As Dan from the channel Folding Ideas puts it in his excellent video [In Search Of A Flat Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTfhYyTuT44):\n\n&gt; Nominally, Flat Earth is a belief that the Earth isn't a globe, but is actually flat, a fact that has been kept from Us, meaning normal people, by a nebulous, powerful Them for nefarious, inscrutable purposes. ... I think it's worth considering that the shape of the Earth might actually be the least important belief of Flat Earth. Flat Earth is a syncretic, biblical belief that is both evangelical and apocalyptic. ... The world is flat and They are hiding that fact from you because a flat Earth would be irrefutable proof that we live in a divine fishbowl and, thus, that God is real.\n\n&gt; Flat Earthers are not otherwise empty vessels who believe one kooky thing. They believe that thing because it suits their purposes. Flat Earthers have an agenda. ... Their anxiety is that the world has become too complex, that too many things are changing, and that science and progressivism are actively malicious elements working to obstruct the true nature of God.  Most people don't actually believe Flat Earth because they were persuaded by shoddy evidence... they do so because it says something they already believe about the nature of the social world.",

I was heavily influenced and believed in multiple conspiracies in the Zeitgeist film as well. There was a never ending source of dark, shadowy \"they's and them's\" controlling everything behind the scenes.\n\nI think there were a few factors that helped me escape that:\n\n* Losing my father. It was such a life changing event at that age that it made me reconsider everything in my life. \n\n* Some light training in evaluating information. I learned about how to vet sources, primary, whether something was actually news or just an opinion/editorial, etc.. Ironically, this education came *before* I was duped. After my dad died, suddenly this started to kick in more.\n\n* Lack of time/means to dig myself a deeper hole. I started college shortly after my father passed and that + a full time job took up all my time. I had none to buy further into the newest crazy bullshit. I had no Facebook/Twitter/IG/etc.. No smart phone or texting. My primary use of Reddit once I discovered it was for r/Naruto, r/Bleach, rage comics, and advice animals. \n\nSo all in all, I think the time away gave me time to detox. If I had been on social media as I discovered those things, I can only imagine I very well may have become a Q believer as well. Looking back I see how gullible I was in that moment, fooled by the onslaught of half truths and clever \"logic\" of the various theories. I know better now (and I should have known better then), but I've been humbled to the fact that everyone is vulnerable to this sort of stuff. To think otherwise is deluding yourself.",

I watched one or two conspiracy videos online when they were newish, they asked questions that couldn't be answered, raised doubts, highlighted coincidences, etc. Basically I became convinced a missile hit the Pentagon, and that was my belief. I wasn't obsessive over it, just a background belief. Then I came across a discussion online, a debate about 9/11, and one poster was pointing out there was wreckage of the plane all over the Pentagon grounds, and I was like \"nope\" (relating to something in one of the videos), however within seconds of looking online I found the photos of the wreckage, and just about everything else.\n\nTo cut a long story short, the online \"documentaries\" (911 conspiracy videos) I had previously watched were in fact very carefully crafted pieces of propaganda designed to make the viewer cast doubt on the event by highlighting very specific and selective pieces of information, out of context, distorted or just flat out untrue in order to hint that some vague conspiracy took place without ever specifying that conspiracy.\n\nNow I'm very much a skeptic. The dead giveaway to these type of conspiracy videos is that they never actually detail the conspiracy itself, from the ground up. They never provide a coherent timeline, never provide direct evidence of the conspiracy itself. It's all indirect. \"Look at this discrepancy, look at this coincidence, look at this oddity - can't explain that, therefore conspiracy\"\n\nSame with Boston bombing conspiracies, Sandy hook, all that. Identical process involved each time. I actually (masochistically) spend some time debunking conspiracies online every now and then, it's largely a futile exercise, but the most simple approach is just to ask someone to detail the conspiracy with credible evidence. They almost all instantly fall apart. To this day no one has ever provide a coherent 9/11 theory, not even the guys at AE911 who make money from this stuff. It's a bizarre hobby to say the least.",

Some modern conspiracies have gotten \"smarter\" and provide really shitty \"proof\" that has 10 levels of sourcing that end up back at some 8chan /pol thread that isn't even accessible but just a screenshot. \n\nNonetheless, most conspiracies follow that same \"look I'm asking a question that can't be answered right now if you don't know the appropriate context, that *must* mean there is some dark figures pulling strings...right?!\". \n\nWhat frustrates/terrifies me is watching other people fall into this now. I know what worked for me, but by in large outside intervention isn't what pulled me out of the abyss. I'm never sure of what to do other than follow up their questions with more questions to try to get them see the errors themselves.",

It started with him wanting proof that SARS-COV-2 (corona virus) was real. He claimed it had never been isolated or photographed (because all he saw in the media was \"CGI\"), that it didn't make sense that a virus from a bat could infect a human because we, as he did correctly state, are not bats. I linked him multiple peer-reviewed, pre-COVID scientific articles about zoonotic diseases, including the prevalence at which they come from bats/birds/livestock, an interview with a USAID PREDICT researcher (also the .gov website reflecting his association with the facility) about how they anticipated the virus, and a National Institute of Health primary article photographing an isolated SARS-COV-2 virus. That's when he said it was all lies and that I \"probably believe the earth is round and that we went to the moon\", which is when I made the comment about believing anything since clearly he would have disregarded round-earth proof anyway as well. I really wish I would have screenshot the conversation before he deleted it all, they were (if I do say so) pretty solid shutdowns.",

The day that changed it forever though was when I asked my father what happens when you get to the edge of the world, he of course said the world is round like a ball.

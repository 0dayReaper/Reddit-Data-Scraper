For starters, I'd have some classic finger foods like mozzarella sticks, loaded nachos, and jalapeno poppers. As for mains, I'd offer hearty burgers, loaded hot dogs, and an array of badass sandwiches like pulled pork, fried chicken, and hearty vegan options. For sides, we'd have crispy fries, onion rings, and plenty of spicy sauces to dip them in. And of course, for dessert, we'd have a decadent selection of cake, cookies, and ice cream sundaes. All of the dishes would be given metal-inspired names, like 'The Slayer Burger' or 'Black Sabbath Brownies.' It's all about embracing the vibe and bringing some serious rock and roll energy to every meal.",

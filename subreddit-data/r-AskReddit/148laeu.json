I literally would not date someone who didn't work. I would not date someone who did not desire to work. Some relationships are like that and some aren't. You want a princess to pamper? You want a pet? Whichever is fine but not everyone else wants that. Some of us want an equally capable partner. Who's with us because they see us as a partner. Not because they need a keeper or caretaker to provide for them. I don't mean to criticize other relationship dynamics, just your narrow view. Because I have friends that their wives don't work, and that's fine. Their wives aren't incapable though if anything since they quit their jobs to focus on their families they work even harder. There's nothing wrong with this guy and his wife working and having kids, they are not less for it.",

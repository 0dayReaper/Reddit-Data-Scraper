Tech support noticed it pretty much immediately when we started getting calls, but then we had to confirm, get it through the proper channels, and notify everyone. There was also a pretty heavy delay. Facebook/etc went down and we didn't start seeing our first calls about it until 30 minutes or so later - at which point we were unaware there was an issue, but suddenly every single call is about the same thing.",

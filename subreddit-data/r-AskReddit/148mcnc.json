Um, I usually feel superior to bigots - the racists, transphobes, homophobes, etc.  I mean, I recognize that each one is an individual person with their own journey and all that, but it's 2023 ffs.  If you can get enough internet access to be a jerk online then you have no excuse in ignorance.",

If you can focus, can read a manual/follow instructions, know how to Google, and can provide halfway decent customer service, you are already better than me.\n\nAs a dad, my kids say that I'm the best dad in the world.

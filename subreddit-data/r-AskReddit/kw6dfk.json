Then it was cooking something to eat. As each little thing graduated from my \"thing\" for the day to just habit, I would add a new thing. It took awhile to be functional again. It really did feel like I was crawling when everyone else was running.",

Depending on the day, it could be just getting out of bed and feeding myself. On better days, it's getting some work done and doing dishes. Just commiting to 2 things sounds simple, so it helps keep me to it.\n\nAnd sorry about your mom, I hope you're doing okay and continuing to graduate in doing the things.",

We had two preteen boys that he didn\u2019t want anything to do with. Some how I kicked him out of the house. Didn\u2019t accept his fake apologies. And then watched my run turn into a walk, then a crawl. I dragged us through every day. It happened the last two weeks of school and I still went to their end of the year award programs and smiled even though neighbors were whispering and I hosted birthday parties minus a parent and I taught one to drive. I am not completely sure how I was strong enough but I brought us all forward in those dark days. I wasn\u2019t going to let this affect them. And now, even with their dad living three miles away with his new family and acting like they don\u2019t exist, I crawl, with them on my back.\n\nEdit: I really appreciate all the kindness. It\u2019s comforting to hear the positive thoughts as it\u2019s often so isolating. I can\u2019t believe I received so many comments. I plan to read and respond to all. Oh and the awards! Wow!

My dad did the same shit and moved off to live with another woman and barely chats with us.  Even though 3 years later my brother died in an accident.  He still never tried to have a real relationship with me or my sister after that.  I'm 36 now with a wife and 2 wonderful kids he has never met.  My mom on the other hand who powered the storm and made sure we got everything we needed even if she went without is still in my life and amazing.  My sister and I both have a great relationship with her.  i believe my sister still talks to my dad some but even she still complains he sucks.  I hear he posts depressing stuff on facebook about how his kids dont talk to him but I dont care.  My dad chose to have me I am just his son by default.  The only time in the last 15 years he called me was when my first son was born.  I offered him to come visit and he never went through with it.  All he has to do is ask to come visit and I will welcome him but I'm not going to try and build a relationship with someone who left me and didn't try.  This turned into a wall of text but all I really wanted to say is your boys will appreciate and recognize the work you are putting in. That crawl will become a sprint and you'll realize you are strong as fuck and the true champion.  Keep being awesome Mom :)",

I am so proud of you for standing up for yourself and for your boys. I've been through so many relationships where I was too weak to do just that. And good god was it hell. \n\nOf course it is hell either way. But at least this way your dignity is more intact than it would be otherwise. It doesn't matter to your boys, they don't know a life where you \"made up\" with him and were subjected to it again and again. It matters to you, because whatever is left of your dignity when you have a chance to look back is mountains more than it could have been. You saved your boys, but just as importantly, you also saved yourself. I know so many women who couldn't do it and ended up drug-addicted on the street, kids wards of the state, having lost everything.\n\nYou are a QUEEN. It takes some kind of guts to get up at your lowest and face the day. My mom's generation went, \"Parenting is hard. If your kids ate today, you haven't yet failed as a mother.\" Today I think \"If your suicide attempts have failed, your parenting hasn't\" is more accurate. \n\nThank you for raising your boys. And please consider therapy if you haven't already. It makes everything that much easier.",

After the first semester dropped out and enlisted. 3 years later I'm medically discharged. Worked multiple shit jobs wile attending CC, find a somewhat decent job while nearing the completion of my associates, then the recession happens. Finish my associates while spending a year on unemployment. Unemployment runs out and I decide to hold off on trying to transfer to finish my 4yr degree. Get a job at gas station, month later promoted to assistant manager, 8mo later, I'm store manager. Year later leave for a contractor position at a bank doing ATM support. About a year later im hired on as an employee. 5.5 years later im in a new salaried role doing data analysis and finishing my degree.",

                    "comment": "Man, I thought you were going to say \"now I'm 40 and got my shit together\", but three years is an amazing turnaround in circumstance, my hat off to you. \n\nMy favorite anecdote is about the philosopher who became suicidally depressed when he concluded that there was no meaning to life or the universe, and wanted to end his own life. \n\nBut then he realized, that if there was no external meaning, it meant that life could mean anything he wanted it to mean, and immediately snapped out of his funk and went on with his life. \n\nAnd the lesson there is, a simple matter of perspective can make all the difference.  And that doesn't mean that people can just magically cure their depression, but it does mean that the feeling of hopelessness and despair that feels all-consuming, it isn't forever.  It feels like it, it tells you it is, but its a liar.  There is happiness and purpose *inside you*, inside all of us, and its worth fighting for.\n\nEDIT:  This is a line from the show *Altered Carbon*, but it stuck with me:  The only enemy is despair. \n\nIt may sound cliche at first, but it is helpful because it reminds us that no matter how many struggles we are facing simultaneously, from within or without, these problems are not *the* problem.  Because really, *life* is just an endless series of \"problems\".  That's all life is.  We fight entropy until we die. \n\nFinding something to eat is a problem.  Finding shelter is a problem.  Finding employment is a problem.  Requiring rest is a problem.  All we do, all day, is solve problems.  But that's life, and it can be invigorating!  There's no end goal; we solve the problems for the thrill of *doing*.   \n\nThe *real* enemy in all of this is the *despair* that we cannot overcome those problems.  That there is no *point* to overcoming our problems, that they are too much for us, that we are not worth the overcoming.  We feel as though our problems are *too many*, and *too large*, and we retreat, we cower; *we despair*.  \n\nBut its a simple mental trick, at the end of the day.  Count-as-one, a mathematical trick for dealing with infinity.  When faced with the vastness of infinity, we just point at it and say, \"that is *one*\".  And in doing so, we can now *act on it*.\n\nThe brain gets overwhelmed at the number of obstacles, but you can simplify.  You can crunch the numbers.  It isn't many problems you face, but one problem: the despair that your problems will overwhelm you.  Once you solve *that*, you simply *do*.  You can take action with boldness and decisiveness, and what will be will be.  The problems will be solved, or they will change.  The problem is not the problems; it is your lack of motivation to deal with them.  And this is when we begin to circle suicidal thoughts; in our despair at the magnitude and volume of our problems, we grow paralyzed, we feel helpless, and we feel as though self-annihilation is the only way to regain a measure of control.  And that is depsair. \n\nOnly *despair* convinces you not to act, and in that way, it is the only real enemy we ever face.  Once despair is overcome, there are only the problems to be solved.  No matter how many, you take one down, you work it, you solve it, and you work another, until you are no more.",

Which is what I did, because hey, one more day wouldn't matter, and the worst that would happen is that I'd pack it in and go home.\n\nWell, a day of rest seemed to be exactly what I needed.  I spent a whole day (or most of it, anyway) in blessed air conditioning, ate all the food, drank all the water, and was more or less ready to go again.\n\nI took a few more one-day breaks between Missouri and Williamsburg, VA which really helped me out.\n\nSo yeah, one step back, two steps forward.",

My parents always thought I was just acting up, from middle school on, when really I was so depressed that I hated myself and pretty much everybody else. I didn't even realize that's what it was until I finally went to the doctor at 25 because I was having mood swings from really aggressive to \"I don't want to get out of bed.\" She diagnosed me with bipolar, started me on medication, and put me in touch with a psychologist. From there it was slow going but things started to improve.\n\nBut when I called my mom after I left the doctor's office she started raising h*ll, saying that there was nothing wrong with me, I was just lazy, it was all in my head (uh, yeah mom, that's where mental illness comes from?). And my dad was even worse. Eventually my dad came around when he saw the improvement in me. Mom kind of came around, but not really. She believes that the medication and counseling have helped me, but she still doesn't really believe in mental illness. She's been diagnosed as bipolar also. She cussed the doctor out, walked out, and started looking for a new doctor the next day. She always tells me it's not her, it's \"the situation\" or \"it's (fill in the person's name)\" that's causing her to be the way she is.\n\nSo I definitely know where you're coming from. Having been there I can empathize with you. But you'll be walking soon, then running. Maybe even flying! I'm 41 years old now. I've been on medication for 16 years. The first few years were still rough, but slowly it gets better. Honestly, I felt a big improvement just getting diagnosed from the relief of knowing what was actually going on. I would say I'm running right now. I don't think I'll ever fly, but before I went to the doctor that day I can't even say I was crawling. I was just laying there. So have hope for yourself, and know that at least one person out there is rooting for you!",

In the end it was never finished but had some (at least what I thought) cool stuff in it.\n\nEdit: [here\u2019s an old screen capture ](https://imgur.com/gallery/ThoIKfc) to show what I mean about the age thing. the face and body proportions change so that they actually look younger, not just shorter.

Then 5 days ago I picked up a sketch book and pencil for the first time in years and said, just ten minutes. A couple of days a week. I've ended up getting lost in it for a couple of hours already, and I can't describe the feeling of joy when I looked at the completed outline and thought, holy shit, it actually looks like the thing I'm drawing. I have barely begun shading but I'm so excited to continue it tomorrow.",

I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no resources to pursue it if I did.  \n\nSomething like finishing college or traveling the world or pursuing my artistic dreams or having a loving relationship was completely beyond my grasp.     \n\nBut one day I messaged an acquaintance.  Actually, an ex girlfriend of a guy I knew.  And I asked if she wanted to hang out.  Eventually that became a relationship, we got married, I started publishing books, we lived in Europe for a while, etc.  None of that was possible from the place I started in.  But I dug myself out one small victory at a time.  \n\nLife keeps changing.  I'm divorced but in a much healthier and happier relationship, living far from where I'd ever been.  I found another fulfilling career and lots of good friends.  And I'll never fall into the place I was again because I have memory of my own success.  Once you can recall confidence, you can always use that as the first step to anything else.",

Make a list of places you think you'd enjoy living, then research them more in depth.  Just about everywhere has communities of expats living there who can help you get a feel for what it's really like to move somewhere.  Then you need to figure out how you're actually going to live there.  Presumably you need a job.  If it's a foreign country you'll need to research how to get residency there or at least how long you can stay as a visitor.  You'll need a place to live as well.  Again, expat communities are often great at helping to figure this out.  \n\nMoving far away costs money and it can definitely be stressful, but in my opinion it's absolutely worth it.  The first time I moved I went from the midwest US to Istanbul and it was about as big of a change of scenery and culture as you can imagine.  Things were sometimes frustrating and confusing, but being surrounded by potential new experiences and new people to meet at all times is incredible.",

Immediately before, he had maxed out my credit cards and spent all of the savings.earlier, he prevented me from finishing my BS and from working. I had two toddlers and friends who were kind enough to share time watching the babies so I could work enough to get by. He stalked me and harassed me with threats daily. I also broke a tooth in half (stress grinding) and was hospitalized for a week for what should have been a minor illness. There were at least five times I could have easily died that year.\n\nI did some work from home and paid off enough of my credit line to charge tuition to it. I honestly thought it would kill me, but I finished a degree and kept my babies alive while well under the poverty line with only some help from friends. Just enough childcare to cover, sometimes not enough and I'd have to call in.\n\nIt felt impossible. The only thing that got me through was telling myself that I could because I was already doing it, so I could keep on doing it and the belief that eventually it would be better. We got through. I got a degree and a decent job, the kids are well. I bought a house! We've come so far in just a few years. It's amazing, really.",

            "comment": "My life was completely devastated by sexual violence in my teens. \n\nIt took a while for it to sink in and for the effects to kick in. I had to drop out of University after nearly three years, completely depressed and I gained a ton of weight on medication - I literally went from being a conventionally attractive girl to someone who was very very overweight (although still in my opinion quite beautiful). \n\nI dropped out of University. I had a boyfriend but most of my friends disappeared. I had a breakdown and spent a night in a psych ward. \n\nI did everything I could do help myself after that. I got books on the internet that I knew could help me. I went to see a therapist. Twice a week, I got two buses and walked a long way to see the same therapist. I was huge from the meds and felt like such a failure but I just kept on going. I got a part time job which really helped me with my emotion regulation. I saved up money to go and see my boyfriend.\n\nDuring the year I applied for new courses at university. However, in the ultimate act of humility I ended up going to continue the same degree at a much lower class university. I still had a good time.\n\nThere people didn't think much of me. I was overweight and still quite emotionally unstable. I was having symptoms from the trauma that affected me in a really bad public way. But I knew I was going somewhere.\n\nI kept my head down and ran. Through all the humiliation and some bullying, I did my degree, even though my concentration was so bad from the trauma that I had to work all night every night and had no social life whatsoever. I went to more therapy. And when it went south, I went to more.\n\nI finished that degree seemingly unable to live alone. However I found the subject I was truly passionate about and this motivated me to persevere. Instead of moving in back home, I proceeded to do TWO master's degrees. And by the way, I continued to have many public and humiliating symptoms and I nearly got kicked out of uni a couple of times cos they didn't like it and refused to understand but I kept on going.\n\nFive years after dropping out I have two MSc's. I just landed my first job after 132 applications. I continued to attend therapy throughout the two Master's and I am doing do much better. I am still a bit curvy, but really, there are worse things in life, and it's kind of adorable.\n\nEdit: getting over sexual trauma is one of the hardest things you can ever do, especially if it happened to you as a child. To have overcome this, while persevering with my studies to such a high degree, is to me to have continued moving forward.\n\nSecond edit: Wow thank you for the awards everyone!!",

Her twin was stuck in the NICU for four months that started at the beginning of COVID. Only my wife was allowed to see my daughter and I was stuck at home with a 9 year old and a 1 year old, both on the spectrum.\n\nI became so stressed and depressed I put on that COVID weight and pretty much became a sloth. I never had the motivation to get up and do anything. I quit my job, dropped out of school, wasn\u2019t sleeping, and the cycle of depression continued.\n\nThen I got a counselor. I just wanted to talk about the stress of the NICU and the preemie baby. That evolved into seeing a doctor about my weight and potential health issues. Turns out my circadian rhythm is off, my upper jaw is preventing me proper air flow, and I was showing early signs of Hashimotos.\n\nFrom there I started a new job where I walked a lot. I didn\u2019t lose weight but I started to feel better about myself being active. Then I started exercising, 20-30 minutes a day. Now, I walk about 8-10 miles at work, exercise for 45 min a day, eat healthy, and generally feel great about life.\n\nIt\u2019s not much but I was at my lowest point this year and the only thing stopping me from killing myself was my wife and kids. Now I\u2019m working a great job I enjoy, lost 16 lbs since thanksgiving, and my early signs of hashimotos have reduced significantly. I\u2019m really proud of myself.",

I spent a lot of effort and time figuring out how to make it happen.\n\nThen *those* classes were also canceled.\n\nDepressed, in massive medical debt, and living with my parents, I flung myself to the ground and crawled onward.\n\nEnding up having to wait for the local campus to start classes later in the year, but I did, and though the coming year would not be very pleasant, either, I ended up graduating and got a good job after.\n\nNow, I could mention that the degree was with ITT Tech and I'd end up laid off for bullshit reasons in 2008, but eh, that's another story.",

Through it all I managed to make it to school most days and graduate with college credit. I still don\u2019t know what I want to do but I have hope because I worked so hard. I also worked as a busser all throughout my junior and part of my senior year to save money.my mom eventually sobered up and the day I graduated we signed a lease on a house. It\u2019s still hard, since I was robbed I still don\u2019t have much but it\u2019s enough. I\u2019m proud at how far I\u2019ve come.",

They told me there was one open in my town, but it didn\u2019t work out that way. It was great money and I was newly married. To sweeten the deal and not lose me, they offered me a furnished room in the building and it was only Monday through Thursday. Some of the best times of my 20\u2019s were had there. Wii bowling every night, big dinners, movie nights... the whole 9 yards. I enjoyed it immensely and was almost sad when the opening became available in my hometown.\n\n\nI never edit these and usually thank people individually if I get awards, not possible now, so thanks everyone, I appreciate you.",

I helped her with chores like snow shoveling, mowing, minor repairs and she fed and housed me. We played cards a few nights each week and really got to know each other. It was wholesome and great since she lived 600 miles away when I was growing up.\n\nedit: thanks for the awards and upvotes!",

Absolutely not all alzheimers patients are aggressive, or aggressive all of the time. I personally don't have the fortitude to care for people, with alzheimers, on a daily basis. I have lost two family members to it, and I know how difficult and heartbreaking it can be to deal with. I did it for them, I could not do it again, unless it was family.",

One of my favorite things is that he swore like, well, like a sailor, and was constantly cracking rude jokes, so for the longest time I thought he was just one of those people. Turns out that, despite his condition, he *never* swore around \"the ladies\" (the care staff, who were nearly all female on his floor, but I'm male so it was fair game I guess haha), and they almost didn't believe me when I told them about the stuff he would say. They thought he was just a really sweet old man!\n\nAlso, and I'm not sure if this helps, but one aspect of the disease that seems to be fairly uniform is that people often lose any insight into the specifics of their situation. So, his world was a confusing one to be sure, but it didn't seem particularly scary or as deeply unsettling as one might imagine just hearing about it.",

She also once woke us kids up in the middle of the night to feed us cake. I loved her little quirks but unfortunately she started to have random violent outbursts and my parents couldn't risk it as my little sister was just a baby. It was very sad visiting her in hospital but she also seemed very happy there.

I am currently caring for my elderly mother whose short term memory is almost non existent.  Most of her memories are childhood.  I am learning things about her life with her parents and 10 brothers and sisters.  I never met her parents, my grandparents, and through her memory flashes I learn about their lives.  Mom was the youngest and by age eight both her parents had passed. She spent a good portion of her childhood moving from sibling to sibling.  She looks very much like her mother, I look very much like her.  So I guess I also resemble my grandmother.  Sometimes my mom will slip and say \u2018yes ma\u2019am\u2019 when answering a question from me.  Those are the times I realize she thought I was her mother.  It is a bittersweet period in my life.  One I did not request but glad I am able to do.  To all the other family members who are caregivers as I am, from the bottom of my heart, *bless you*.  I\u2019m sending great big hugs and the assurance that you are not alone on your path. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95",

Most of them didn\u2019t have visitors and would need someone to sit with them through the night in case they tried to leave their room. I would sit and just talk to them. Encourage them. I got a nonverbal person to talk to me just by talking one-sided for three nights straight. They hadn\u2019t talked to anyone else in the 40 days they were hospitalized. \n\nThey are confused souls who have been dealt a horrible hand late in life. I wanted to try and give them as much genuine human interaction as possible. \n\nAlso just a note: barely any PCAs/nurses are as kind and understanding. If you have a relative with memory issues ALWAYS have someone accompany them during their hospital stay. A lot of them are treated less than human. They\u2019re abused and neglected because others don\u2019t want to deal with them. I\u2019ve seen it first hand.\n\nEdit: wow 8 awards?? Thank you but I truly don\u2019t deserve it!",

Three of my grandparents had dementia/Alzheimer\u2019s before they passed. I was young but I still understood the pain it caused my family. It\u2019s important to remember that the person you know as your grandmother is still there. They do truly love and miss you, their brains have just gone through some damage so they can no longer express it or remember. Being there with them may hurt, but it\u2019s also healing.

My Grandma\u2019s dementia started slow...she had started to call me like 2-6 times a day to have the same conversation/ask the same question and I started to notice while doing their accounts that she was making 2-3 trips to the grocery store and purchasing the same amount. Once I got down to my hometown sure enough I checked the cupboards and she had multiples of everything bc she was forgetting she bought it. The anger was only temporary and it\u2019s when they know they are forgetting and are embarrassed at least it was for her and my other Grandma too. I can say that spending those 5 years with her every chance I got was hard so hard as she had raised me and thought I was one of her sisters. She thought my children however were me and my sister so that would make it easier(I talked to both girls and told them to answer to whatever name she called them as I saw no need to constantly remind the strongest most independent beautiful soul I knew that her mind was going). In the end we were praying for God to take her as she was a \u201cfaller\u201d and was in so much pain. I spent every night I was in town at the home with her and made sure she was at a home 2 of my high school friends worked at so I got hourly updates. Her final lucid moment with me was after a fall in the hospital. We were just sitting there looking out the hospital room window and she grabbed my hand tears streaming down her face she thanked me and my now late husband for always being there snd told me it was time for me to go live my new life with my family and stop driving 750 miles every other week to care for her. I\u2019m glad it was her last lucid moment bc of course I was going to get every second with my Grandma before she went and I loved pretending to be whoever she thought I was bc I learned soooo much about her she never would\u2019ve told me lucid. As painful as it is to be forgotten it is sooo amazing to get those precious moments and memories. Plus you get a nice long goodbye! I called her everyday of my adulthood and 4 yrs later I miss her like crazy! They need that interaction with people every day. Keeps them happy and content so they aren\u2019t just lying in a bed staring at the ceiling getting depressed. I\u2019m super grateful and blessed for everyone that would sit with my Grandma and visit with her when me or my sister couldn\u2019t get there! They made her days better!",

While I can say now I wouldn't want to go through that and it's painful for everyone involved, at the same time if they are comfortable and well taken care of by professionals it doesn't necessarily have to be full of misery for them. Yes it's scary and tragic to lose yourself like that, but for example he still enjoys his music they play and art so all life doesn't just stop. I don't know much about this topic so may be totally off, just saying it is a very grey area and that idealistic choice is not so simple when confronted with the reality of death or a more limited lifestyle..",

She'd watch while I played and would call me on snow days to invite me to play. She passed away a little over 16 years ago and I miss her every day. I cried at the opening of Breath of the Wild because I could only imagine how much she would have loved to see it the graphics. Every time I play a Zelda game, I think about how lucky I am to have experienced that with her. I am so sorry for your loss. There are still days when I get emotional from missing her, but you and I were so blessed to have had grandparents to share special games with.",

The gig payed well enough but FML it didn't pay nearly enough for the nurses &amp; the shit I saw they had to deal with.\n\nI had some good memories at least, especially of a blind veteran that would always stop by at the same time every day to chat. He loved telling old war stories and I enjoyed hearing them he was good at telling them.\n\nBut the dementia ward would ruin that every night. So many of them screaming they had been kidnapped or that they didn't know where they were. I remember one had gotten out, kind little old lady in her pajamas I found her on the side of the road trying to hitch hike to the mall. She was so determined to go I had to lie to her and say I was delivering a package before I could take her so I could get her back to the home and tell the nurses.",

Many of the patients there had issues like dementia. There was a lady down the hall who would scream for help any time her family was not there visiting her. I could never keep my door open because of how loud it was, and I could sometimes hear her even when my door was closed. \n\nThe nurses could tell it was freaking me out but they were also incredibly overworked with everything they had to do in that ward. They said with patients like that, there's very little that they can do because they can't just give them medicine to knock them out 24/7 and they really only stop when family or someone they recognizes visits. A lot of them have to be strapped to the bed.\n\nJust...constant yelling and moaning. \"Help me. Heeeeelp me.\" and then moans that sounded like pain. Like something out of a horror movie or video game. It made an already difficult recovery for me even harder.",

Very beige, white and sometimes teal. I\u2019m sure a lot of that is for practical reasons, but I wonder how much is just because that\u2019s what a hospital setting is \"supposed\u201d to look like. You\u2019d think in a nursing home, where people are expected to live long term, things could look a bit less clinical.",

There were aiiiibout 15 residents, &amp; they all had their own little  apartment. It had a kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, &amp; little sitting area. Downstairs was a common room/dining room, where they would have activities &amp; if they didn't feel like cooking, could eat. It was honestly some of the best food I've ever had, so we always loved going to visit around a meal time!! My paternal grandmother lived in a more typical rest home, but they worked really hard to make it not feel like one. They took really good care of her there.",

It was an amazing and positive experience. \n\nWhen I met my partner, he ran the maintenance department for a group of nursing homes that specialised in caring for elderly people with dementia. I went in on a callout to one of the homes at 3am once. There was an elderly lady clawing at the window screaming \u201clet me out\u201d because she didn\u2019t know where she was or why she was there.\n\nWhether it would be an amazing or horrific experience would depend entirely on what level of care the imaginary residents of this imaginary home were receiving!",

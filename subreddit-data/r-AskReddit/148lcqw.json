I strongly suspected he had a crush on one of our neighbour women. I was young and weak, and agreed to the arrangement. He started sleeping with the neighbour. For the first couple of months, I didn\u2019t do any outside activities, but because he was getting laid from the neighbor, our sex life basically dropped to nothing. So I started putting the feelers out. Within two days I had probably 15 men interested. I remember scrolling through their messages one day and he came over and asked me what was going on and I was honest with him. He pretended to be OK with it. A week later, his side chick dumped him. All of a sudden he wanted to be monogamous again.\ud83d\ude44. Needless to say the relationship did not last.",

It sounds like he was outright having another entire relationship with a different woman which if I understand open relationships correctly, isn\u2019t how any of that works. Sounds like he literally just wanted permission to be in a second relationship and you gave it to him.",

Basically just sounding like they were trying to convince their SO to let them cheat, thinking the other person was not going to do the same/not get the same amount of attention. But they were wrong. So if my wife even brought it up to me it would be a red flag (also a huge surprise.)  And I wouldn't be into it.\n\nBut if it's for you, working for you, no judgement here.",

She has more opportunities than I do, because let's be honest, it's easier for a beautiful woman than any guy to get laid. I'm fine with that because I have my fun too and we are very up front about everything. We are both strict on the \"no-feelings\" mentality neither of us want a relationship with anyone else besides the physical part. Some people we know go all out and have full relationships with others. If you can do it and enjoy it, it can be very fulfilling and make you enjoy your marriage more. You can also completely wreck a great marriage out of selfishness and dishonest behavior",

The buffet of life and all that.  But you're introducing additional points of failure into your relationship, and you're watering down the intimacy of your relationship.  Kissing is for my wife and I only.  Fucking is for my wife and I only.  Oral is for my wife and I only.  And all of those other things that go along with it.  Something that only we share.  To share that with a bunch of other people...it just makes those things less special.  And I really don't get the point.  So what?  You're roommates who bang and maybe have children?  Because that's essentially what it boils down to.  Two people who split the bills, and fuck each other and other people.\n\nThat being said, it's none of my business what anybody else wants to do.  While I think it's ill-advised, I would never tell another person or couple how they should live their own lives.",

It's no different than going out with a friend to watch a movie. \n\nBUT....here's the difference: sex with *each other* is where the real love and intimacy is. It's like watching a movie on date night with your SO instead. That's where the REAL fun is. And that's where the REAL love is at. It's completely different and much more personal.\n\nOf course there are a lot of rules and communication, but that's the gist of it. \n\nGranted, that's not how I think of Sex because to me it's much more private and reserved for my SO, but hey, if you make it work and are both happy with it then why the hell not?",

            "comment": "I've been in an open marriage since October of 2016 so I can speak with a bit of authority on how they tend to be.\n\nFirst off, most don't work out. There's a lot of people in \"the lifestyle\" that are in it for the wrong reasons. The typical one is they're trying to use other relationships to bolster the weakest parts of their main relationship. Which is like putting duct tape on a hole in the wall. It's obviously a shit fix, looks terrible, and doesn't really solve the problem.\n\nSecond, the jealous one is almost always the man. I say this as a man myself. There's a bit of grey area here also. A few years back my wife was going on dates a couple times a week and then we'd do stuff with friends on the weekends. So we stopped having time just the two of us. I confronted her, we talked, and now we have limitations. We worked through our problems instead of ignoring them.\n\nWhich brings me to my third point, rules. The only way this works is if you have guardrails on what is ok and not ok. If you can't agree on it then DON'T FUCKING DO IT. Women are obviously at a huge advantage in this type of scenario because there's way more guys looking for action than ladies. This is also why I think the guys tend to get more jealous than the women.\n\nSome tips: give your partner veto power but also don't abuse said power. I usually don't have any issues with the guys my wife is with because her and I typically hang out with couples and just swap with them. But having veto power gives comfort to both parties of something feels off. Also don't try to be equal. For example, don't set a rule to be they can only go out as often as you have. It creates a weird scenario where one person may never do anything and then the other can't as well. Which always leads to problems. Lastly, you have to communicate well with all parties involved. You have to get tested. You have to get tested. And yet again, GET TESTED. You want your marriage to blow up? Give your spouse an STI you got from someone else.\n\nIf you're looking to dip your toes in the water try to find a local polyamory group or swinger group. There are a few apps also but they're pretty hit and miss. Also if you're young and attractive try to find groups with very strict no touching and consent rules. There's a group in my area that's notorious for looking the other way when guys (and sometimes girls) literally sexually assault others.",

I strongly suspected he had a crush on one of our neighbour women. I was young and weak, and agreed to the arrangement. He started sleeping with the neighbour. For the first couple of months, I didn\u2019t do any outside activities, but because he was getting laid from the neighbor, our sex life basically dropped to nothing. So I started putting the feelers out. Within two days I had probably 15 men interested. I remember scrolling through their messages one day and he came over and asked me what was going on and I was honest with him. He pretended to be OK with it. A week later, his side chick dumped him. All of a sudden he wanted to be monogamous again.\ud83d\ude44. Needless to say the relationship did not last.",

For them, it is usually pretty even, if the dude isn't getting a bit more. \n\nThere's also ones where the woman is just very much enjoying sex with other people and the dude does seem to get resentful when she's out 3 nights a week getting three different men from the three last week to fuck her. \n\nBut there is definitely relationships I have seen where the woman doesn't seem to want to fuck a different dude even every month. \n\nThe prime thing is: don't be embarrassed about your feelings. \n\nIt is all the rage to *HAVE TO* be okay with literally everything. And people even shame others for not being that. But hey, emotions are not logic and that is OK. If your stance on jealousy is rooted in logic, you're either faking or not human. \n\nAre you not jealous when your SO fucks someone else? Great, it might be for you. Are you jealous? Too bad, it isn't for you. \n\nDon't let manipulative assholes guilt trip you into thinking you should be okay with it. \n\nPersonally, I get jealous when my SO's fuck other men. So it just doesn't work. Other women doesn't make me jealous though, so that is fine and we do that. \n\nThere's always people who go: *'uh that doesn't make sense because she can also leave you for a woman so you shouldn't be okay with that either'* well, turns out I am. Too bad your logic doesn't mesh with my feelings.\n\n*'well then, you should be OK with her fucking other men too then'* no, I very much don't. Feelings are not a choice you ignorant dumbasses. \n\nI can follow you logically, but it just doesn't work like that.  And if only more people would understand that, there'd be way more succesful relationships.",

Basically just sounding like they were trying to convince their SO to let them cheat, thinking the other person was not going to do the same/not get the same amount of attention. But they were wrong. So if my wife even brought it up to me it would be a red flag (also a huge surprise.)  And I wouldn't be into it.\n\nBut if it's for you, working for you, no judgement here.",

If it\u2019s going to work, it has to have the foundation of a very, very strong and healthy relationship to begin with. There are plenty of people who go into polyamory because their relationships/marriages are broken and those people never find anything but misery. But a lot of us, and I\u2019d wager to say the majority of us, we would never try to use poly/opening a relationship to fix something broken. \n\nUsing my own relationship(s) as an example: I\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9e for 8.5 years. I\u2019ve been dating her best friend for close to three years now. We had a solid foundational relationship from all aspects, as lovers (fianc\u00e9e and I) and as friends (my fianc\u00e9e and my girlfriend have been besties for a long time and I was friends with my girlfriend for years before we started dating). There has never been a single hint of drama or hardship in any of it. Fianc\u00e9e helps me plan cute dates for girlfriend. Girlfriend was super excited to help me design fianc\u00e9e\u2019s ring. \n\nSo like, all good there, right? But what you\u2019re saying also holds. If someone goes in to this kind of thing with a standpoint of an already broken relationship, it\u2019s never ever going to work. Polyamory/opening a relationship will never, ever fix a bad relationship. In all of my time in this life, I\u2019ve never once seen it happen. \n\nSo like, you\u2019re not wrong in terms of broken relationships not being helped, but I\u2019d wager there are more of us in healthy poly situations than you might think :)",

I think all three couples would have just straight up broken up if they weren't living together, but they wanted a safety net before they jumped.\n\nOne of my friends agreed to it assuming his girlfriend would never actually go through with sleeping with someone else, then she did within a month. It took her about another three to decide there was nothing better out there and want to call it off, but by then he was too hurt for them to work it out. So essentially she ended up having to move back in with her parents because she couldn't afford rent alone and realized the grass isn't greener.\n\nMy cousin tried an open relationship in a last ditch attempt to keep his girlfriend from breaking up with him. He really would have stayed with her forever, but she left him for her new boyfriend. I personally think he's better off and am very happy to be free of her at family gatherings.\n\nThe dude I know who initiated this is a POS and his girlfriend was funnier, smarter, prettier than him AND made more money. She agreed to it because he essentially told her it wouldn't REALLY happen. When she found out he had made a dating profile like instantly (another friend was on Tinder and screenshoted him), she dumped him and made him move out. He's still trying to make a career as a DJ work and he's still single. She's head of marketing for a top renewable energy company and engaged to the nicest woman ever.",

            "comment": "I've been in an open marriage since October of 2016 so I can speak with a bit of authority on how they tend to be.\n\nFirst off, most don't work out. There's a lot of people in \"the lifestyle\" that are in it for the wrong reasons. The typical one is they're trying to use other relationships to bolster the weakest parts of their main relationship. Which is like putting duct tape on a hole in the wall. It's obviously a shit fix, looks terrible, and doesn't really solve the problem.\n\nSecond, the jealous one is almost always the man. I say this as a man myself. There's a bit of grey area here also. A few years back my wife was going on dates a couple times a week and then we'd do stuff with friends on the weekends. So we stopped having time just the two of us. I confronted her, we talked, and now we have limitations. We worked through our problems instead of ignoring them.\n\nWhich brings me to my third point, rules. The only way this works is if you have guardrails on what is ok and not ok. If you can't agree on it then DON'T FUCKING DO IT. Women are obviously at a huge advantage in this type of scenario because there's way more guys looking for action than ladies. This is also why I think the guys tend to get more jealous than the women.\n\nSome tips: give your partner veto power but also don't abuse said power. I usually don't have any issues with the guys my wife is with because her and I typically hang out with couples and just swap with them. But having veto power gives comfort to both parties of something feels off. Also don't try to be equal. For example, don't set a rule to be they can only go out as often as you have. It creates a weird scenario where one person may never do anything and then the other can't as well. Which always leads to problems. Lastly, you have to communicate well with all parties involved. You have to get tested. You have to get tested. And yet again, GET TESTED. You want your marriage to blow up? Give your spouse an STI you got from someone else.\n\nIf you're looking to dip your toes in the water try to find a local polyamory group or swinger group. There are a few apps also but they're pretty hit and miss. Also if you're young and attractive try to find groups with very strict no touching and consent rules. There's a group in my area that's notorious for looking the other way when guys (and sometimes girls) literally sexually assault others.",

I have no trouble only fucking my wife until I'm too old to do it anymore.\n\nI also don't think it's advisable.  Like, I get it.  There are alot of people out there, change can be fun.  The buffet of life and all that.  But you're introducing additional points of failure into your relationship, and you're watering down the intimacy of your relationship.  Kissing is for my wife and I only.  Fucking is for my wife and I only.  Oral is for my wife and I only.  And all of those other things that go along with it.  Something that only we share.  To share that with a bunch of other people...it just makes those things less special.  And I really don't get the point.  So what?  You're roommates who bang and maybe have children?  Because that's essentially what it boils down to.  Two people who split the bills, and fuck each other and other people.\n\nThat being said, it's none of my business what anybody else wants to do.  While I think it's ill-advised, I would never tell another person or couple how they should live their own lives.",

I got transferred to Seattle and discovered that he had a mistress in Vancouver BC, Mindy, so he would come up every month to \"meet with me\", which involved me picking him up at the airport, taking him to my office, going over the books for 10 minutes. Then \"Mindy\" would pull up, honk, and he would jump up like a puppy and run out to her. I wouldn't see him again for a month.\n\nMy secretary became friends with his secretary and his secretary was friends with his wife, but hadn't heard his \"open marriage\" story. My secretary eventually told her about Mindy, she told his wife, who happened to be a paralegal for a divorce attorney!\n\nI heard this part of the story later from my secretary (who heard it from his, who heard it from the wife). So his wife arranges for them to go to Cuba on vacation (they were Canadian citizens so they could) at an all-inclusive resort. They are at the swim-up bar having drinks, she says she has to go up and take a nap. A few hours later he goes to leave the bar and sign the tab off to his room, the bartended tells him he can't, because he has already checked out. He checks with the front desk, his wife is gone and taken EVERYTHING with her; his wallet, passport, credit cards, clothes, everything. He has only his swim trunks and his watch. He has to sell his watch to have something to live on because it takes him 6 weeks to get a replacement passport and access to a friend in South Africa that will loan him enough to get home to California.  When he gets home, his wife has sold their house (she had Power of Attorney) and moved back to Ontario. Because he was gone without asking, he lost his job (although I suspect she had a hand in that too). \n\nThe rest of this I found out from him and later, a mutual friend. He moves to Vancouver to move in with Mindy, turns out his wife had called her and told her that he was now broke and jobless, so Mindy dumped him. He found a shit job in Vancouver, but hated it and eventually pinned a note on his jacket, parked in front of Mindy's house, and ate his shotgun!\n\nOpen marriage...",

It's like watching a movie on date night with your SO instead. That's where the REAL fun is. And that's where the REAL love is at. It's completely different and much more personal.\n\nOf course there are a lot of rules and communication, but that's the gist of it. \n\nGranted, that's not how I think of Sex because to me it's much more private and reserved for my SO, but hey, if you make it work and are both happy with it then why the hell not?",

With kids, work, and just everyday life in general, I would be hurt if him or I neglected our family for those important time opportunities to be present.

Ethical nonmonogamy (ENM) requires a lot of discussion, maturity, openness, trust, respect, transparency, and labor. There need to be rules and boundaries, reasonability, understanding, honesty, and patience. I'm not here to write a whole guidebook for ENM but my point is that there's a lot more that goes into it than a lot of people actually practice, engage in, or even think about. A lot of people do it for the wrong reasons, refuse to acknowledge when it's not working out, misunderstand jealousy, don't experience compersion, pretend to be happy, get selfish, become manipulative, etc. etc.\n\nYou'll find a lot of horror stories from people who tried open relationships. Most of those people didn't know what they actually wanted, weren't properly prepared/mentally ready for it, or they made any number of mistakes related to the stuff I listed above. It's one of the greatest human feats of hubris I've ever seen that so many people who just shouldn't be ENM try it for the wrong reasons or without understanding what they're getting into and are just so shocked when someone or everyone ends up heartbroken/angry.\n\nENM does work for many. Practicing ENM responsibly by mutually committing to the well-being of all involved, being mindful and considerate, accepting jealousy in yourself and others and learning how to work through it, communicating openly, and respecting each other is most of a great recipe for open relationship success.",

Who am i to question you?\n\nBut personally i choose to not partake on it nor do i have interest in being in an open relationship, it just means that i want a monogamous relationship with someone that wants the same. And there is nothing wrong with that.",

What I mean, is, I have never seen it sustained over a long period. *Something eventually changes.*\n\nIf you think about it, even two people alone, the chances aren't great that it will last for a long time. Add in a 3rd party, seems to me eventually something bad will happen.\n\nI think for those who do enjoy it, they acknowledge that nothing is perfect. In some ways this is a very healthy outlook.\n\nThe challenge seems to come from the idea that the purpose of the open relationship is, essentially, consumption. In some ways sex / intimacy is a form of consumption. And for some people, it's never enough. They always want more.\n\nSomeone will eventually have to be told that they're not enough for the person they love.\n\nThis is a real problem for a lot of people.",

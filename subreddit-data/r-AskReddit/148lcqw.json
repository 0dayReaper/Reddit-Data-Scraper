Especially if they are not.  Also that it was only really suggested because they had someone else specifically in mind, that falls through, and now they are trying to close the relationship again. Basically just sounding like they were trying to convince their SO to let them cheat, thinking the other person was not going to do the same/not get the same amount of attention. But they were wrong. So if my wife even brought it up to me it would be a red flag (also a huge surprise.)  And I wouldn't be into it.\n\nBut if it's for you, working for you, no judgement here.",

For the first couple of months, I didn\u2019t do any outside activities, but because he was getting laid from the neighbor, our sex life basically dropped to nothing. So I started putting the feelers out. Within two days I had probably 15 men interested. I remember scrolling through their messages one day and he came over and asked me what was going on and I was honest with him. He pretended to be OK with it. A week later, his side chick dumped him. All of a sudden he wanted to be monogamous again.\ud83d\ude44. Needless to say the relationship did not last.",

There's a lot of people in \"the lifestyle\" that are in it for the wrong reasons. The typical one is they're trying to use other relationships to bolster the weakest parts of their main relationship. Which is like putting duct tape on a hole in the wall. It's obviously a shit fix, looks terrible, and doesn't really solve the problem.\n\nSecond, the jealous one is almost always the man. I say this as a man myself. There's a bit of grey area here also. A few years back my wife was going on dates a couple times a week and then we'd do stuff with friends on the weekends. So we stopped having time just the two of us. I confronted her, we talked, and now we have limitations. We worked through our problems instead of ignoring them.\n\nWhich brings me to my third point, rules. The only way this works is if you have guardrails on what is ok and not ok. If you can't agree on it then DON'T FUCKING DO IT. Women are obviously at a huge advantage in this type of scenario because there's way more guys looking for action than ladies. This is also why I think the guys tend to get more jealous than the women.\n\nSome tips: give your partner veto power but also don't abuse said power. I usually don't have any issues with the guys my wife is with because her and I typically hang out with couples and just swap with them. But having veto power gives comfort to both parties of something feels off. Also don't try to be equal. For example, don't set a rule to be they can only go out as often as you have. It creates a weird scenario where one person may never do anything and then the other can't as well. Which always leads to problems. Lastly, you have to communicate well with all parties involved. You have to get tested. You have to get tested. And yet again, GET TESTED. You want your marriage to blow up? Give your spouse an STI you got from someone else.\n\nIf you're looking to dip your toes in the water try to find a local polyamory group or swinger group. There are a few apps also but they're pretty hit and miss. Also if you're young and attractive try to find groups with very strict no touching and consent rules. There's a group in my area that's notorious for looking the other way when guys (and sometimes girls) literally sexually assault others.",

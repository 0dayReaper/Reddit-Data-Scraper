Though this is not necessary for fitness, if you want to gain muscle mass, you should be doing the 12-15. And more reps than that, and you're not giving your muscles the exercise they need.",

It will isolate your muscles more. If you prefer standing you can do both arms at the same time, but alternate with each arm. When you lift your right arm your left goes down it'll make the reps more difficult.\n\nYou can also find other things around the house to lift as well.",

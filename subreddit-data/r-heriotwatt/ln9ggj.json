    "postText": "  \n\nDear Redditors!\n\nI have some queries in my mind and I thought it would be better if I would ask you guys.  First thing first, I am from Pakistan and I will be self-funding my masters so your guidance will help me a lot. So here are the questions;\n\n1. I intend to pursue **Masters in Construction Project Management** **(MSc. Full Time)** and right now I have admission offers from **Queen University Belfast (Russell Group) and Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh** for Sep 2021 intake. Both universities have good course content which meets my needs. I just want to know which university is most suitable considering reputation in industry, employability and teaching quality.  **In a nutshell I want to ask which university I should choose.**\n\n2. I have 2 years of construction industry experience in Pakistan (been working on some major projects as a Site Engineer). I would be really grateful if you could tell me about the **software skills** and **interpersonal skills** one should have to improve his employability?  \n \n\n3.  I **choose construction project management for my post graduate studies** because I have been told by my teachers and friends that I have excellent management and interpersonal skills (I was actively involved with university administration in event organization etc. which might have persuaded them to make such remarks) **while lagging a bit on complex design and hard core civil engineering part**. **Also my love for reading and writing (documentation) also played a part in the decision**. **Will these skills be helpful? What should I work on for finishing strong in a UK institute? Is this the right reason?**  \n \n\n4. My internet research has shown me that Belfast is more affordable as compared to Edinburgh for an international student who will be working to earn the living expenses while studying full time. **Should it matter?**  \n \n\nRegards,  \n \n\n(A Junior Redditor seeking guidance)",

I do computer science so I don't know which uni is better for construction management but...\n\nBelfast is cheaper to live in. \nEdinburgh is a nicer city with more stuff to do. \n\nI had originally planned to go to Queen's but they rejected me which meant I ended up in HW. Queens gave me an offer a year later and I rejected them purely because Edinburgh is just a nicer place.\n\nI can't compare the unis but I can compare location and Heriot Watt in Edinburgh is just a lot nicer",

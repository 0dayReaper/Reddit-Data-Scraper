    "postText": "Some questions regarding the Mechanical BEng course duration in Heriot-Watt Malaysia compared to in the UK.\n\nOn the website it's stated that Malaysia's course duration is 3 years, while UK's is 4 years. \n\nIf my plan is to start in Malaysia and complete my 3rd year (Malaysia's final year) in the UK, would I enter the 3rd or 4th year in the UK? Would I need to do an extra year if I enter the 3rd year (in the UK)?\n\nAnd what would the course structure be like? Would I be skipping the syllabus for UK's 3rd year if I go straight to the 4th (final)? \n\nAny answer/advice is appreciated. Thanks for your time!",

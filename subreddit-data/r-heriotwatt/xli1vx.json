    "postText": "Got a laptop with Pop_OS! (basically Ubuntu). Everything's up to date and all's working fine. Using eduroam in my halls, it works fine. But in lecture halls and the library, although my laptop thinks it's connected, I actually can't use the internet.\n\nI'm a Linux novice, but I'm strongly contemplating swapping platforms because this has been a huge headache for me. The IT folks are super helpful and we've been trying to solve the issue for a few days but it's still not resolved.\n\nIf anyone has a magic terminal command I can type in to fix my problems, or generally anyone else who uses a Linux laptop, would love some advice.",

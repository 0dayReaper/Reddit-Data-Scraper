            "comment": "What a coincidence, I just finished accountancy and finance year 1 and moved out of halls this very day. For me it was half online and next year I reckon you will have more in person which I personally think will be a better experience because it's more social. The course was surprisingly easy considering I half arsed a lot of it, I'd compare it to like advanced highers except it's just one subject and there's a bit more depth. Especially in semester 2 there is a ton of emphasis on group projects, it's a bit annoying when you've got some lazy dick that doesn't contribute but just slam some energy juice and work in the GRID building which is a great quality study building. The lecturers are all sound, a few  had tricky accents but for the most part fine. Robbie Mochrie (I think he's the leader of the business school) was by far the best lecturer I'd say, and he was very relevant to the course. When your not doing uni work definitely use the high quality gym which is professional level (Scotland national team train there), and join a sport club even if you feel your not as good as others. Because I was decent at basketball in high school but didn't join the HW team because I felt I'd be shite compared to everyone else and now having left first year I feel it was a missed opportunity because just using the gym can be boring and not as sociable. For nightlife Edinburgh is considered among the best in the UK but for the lord of christ only go out on student nights because the weekend it costs so much. Hive was my favorite club because of how studenty it is and a vodka coke/lemonade is only \u00a31 most nights, keep in mind Hive is probably Edinburgh's chaviest club and it's not rare to see destroyed drunk people, folk doing lines, folk selling drugs, fights etc. Part of why I love Hive is probably due to me and a big squad of HW people being part of a cult following of Trash Tuesday, and it's a good backup club if other places have long queues. Subway nearby is also studenty and quite good (most of Cowgate actually). Bourbon club costs a lot but makes up with great music and from what I found good people. You'll hear a lot of people say Whynot is good nightlife but I'm in the minority that it's overrated. It's the most costly in Edinburgh, music is mid, very busy, arguably too loud, and personally you get a lot of; lets face it posh dicks. Like the type of girls that are stick thin, probably a few grand worth of premium clothing on them, blonde, posh accent, judgmental to the working class sorta people. The girls at Cowgate are more sound, good crack, and 1 night standish. Heriot Watt is definitely the best uni in Edinburgh according to my social circle, like I had 1 friend that went Napier and 1 that went UoE and we agree I had the best quality of life uni experience. Only drawbacks I give is it's a 30-40 bus ride into city center and the student union is a bit underwhelming (not terrible it's \u00a32 Carling and if your just there to watch the football or with a group of friends it's fine, it's just bad in the sense it's small and usually male dominated, and there's not really any new people to meet). Some people could get unlucky and get prick flatmates but I got lucky and didn't, so just pray you get nice folk",

                    "comment": "Thank you for replying, when I apply I would be starting in 2nd year because I am doing a HNC accounting soon and can get direct entry with that. Tbh I won\u2019t be staying in accommodation, i will just get the train. I will need to get 2 trains but their accommodation is too expensive for me. I\u2019m glad the lecturers are nice, nothing worse than having a lecturer that just pisses you off 24/7 and dread going to their lectures. I was thinking of joining a sports club, I was thinking of doing badminton. I\u2019m afraid I will one of the oldest people on the course lol, I will be 22 if I get in and 25 when I finish. I just have to remember that 22 is not old and I\u2019m glad Im studying something I enjoy (I nearly went to uni last year after 2 years at college doing a HNC and HND but ended up realising it wasn\u2019t the right career path for me.) I am interested in what the nightlife is like and don\u2019t want to end up in some posh nightclub with tories \ud83e\udd22. Ngl I\u2019m surprised first year was easy, I thought they would throw you into the deep end.",

    "postText": "I just completed third year and was preparing to graduate this year. I hadn't applied to graduate this month because I got a bunch of emails saying students shouldn't apply to graduate this summer if they were planning to leave at the end of year 3 instead of year 4. The emails said we should apply only in winter.\n\nSo I was expecting to graduate in winter. Didn't get any emails from uni about final results, completing my degree or how/when I'll receive the certificate. Today, as I was watching the virtual graduation, I found out I graduated(?!)\n\nSo my question is: Will I receive my certificate without applying or do I still have to apply to graduate on the self-service website in order to have my certificate sent to me?\n\nIf I need to apply, can I do that now or do I need to wait until winter applications open? I ask this because I see another graduation date on 31 July on the self-service website and I don't want to apply for that one if I'm going to have to pay for delivery. I'd rather wait a few months than pay, especially since I was expecting to graduate late anyways!\n\nI'd appreciate any help. If there's anyone else here in a similar situation, have you already received the certificate or any info about when you'll receive it?",

The deadline for filling this out for summer was the 17th June 2021. This is also the deadline for the postage waiver, where they waive the costs of the postage, so later graduations will incur this fee.\n\nIt sounds like you can still fill out these details for Winter graduation, so you should be able to apply for that and get your degree certificate sent to you with the winter graduation. More info on this comes out in September 2021.\n\nIf you have questions about this I recommend the student service email, which is on all the graduation-related information packs:\nstudentcentre @ hw.ac.uk",

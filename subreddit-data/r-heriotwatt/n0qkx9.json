    "postText": "I have received an unconditional offer from both universities for Masters in Digital Marketing and was looking for advice on which one to choose and why. Also wanted to know which university has a better employability rate and whether the ranking of universities matter in today's job market in the UK.   \nI heard England based universities are considered above Scotland based universities when it comes to the job market in the UK. Is this true? Thanks in advance for the guidance!",

Edinburgh is a lot different to London so it depends where you want to live.\n\nIm fairly sure we have one of the best employability rates in the country here at HW but im not sure if that stat is out of Scotland or the entire UK. In my opinion ranking doesn't matter too much either. \n\nI would just choose the uni that is were you'd prefer to live. Edinburgh is a lovely city but there's more industry in London. Hope this helps!",

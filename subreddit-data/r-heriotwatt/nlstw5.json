    "postText": "Hi all thanks for taking time to read this post.\n\nI'm thinking on doing MSc in energy. Focusing in power generation and energy sources.\n\nIf there is someone that enrolled for this postgraduate I would like to hear your thoughts about this course as it would be great to hear  someone's experience.\n\nI wish to do it on part time basis and given it would be online it would be good for long distance learning even if I move abroad.\n\nMy background is power generation as an stl and worked as a gas operations  engineer with a BEng in Mechanical Engineering.\n\n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "I would. The campus is really nice with high quality equipment and a lot of open space. The main buildings can be abit of a maze when you first get here but apart from that it's great. \n\nThere is plenty of regular buses to the city aswell so getting into Edinburgh isnt an issue. \n\nHope this helps!!",

I\u2019d say it largely depends on the vibe and experience you\u2019re wanting from uni, as well as the course you choose. \n\nThe campus is pretty far away from everything. Not so far that you can\u2019t get into town for post-class drinks, but far enough that by the end of the day you go \u201cnah, I\u2019d rather go home\u201d. There are regular buses, which are convenient depending on where you live. That\u2019s the only way to reach uni if you don\u2019t drive.\n\nOn campus, the activities are sparse. Most societies revolve around bar crawls on week nights, and the student wellbeing centre organises activities on campus sometimes. I\u2019m not sure what the experience is like if you do a sport, but I imagine it fills up social life a bit more! \n\nCampus is so green and beautiful though, which some nice buildings, which is definitely a plus. It can be confusing at first but there are signs everywhere. \n\nIn terms of campus food, it\u2019s not great- we have a few random cafes, a cafeteria with an average selection and a uni shop, as well as the society building which is okay, but nothing special. \n\nIf anything, I\u2019ve noticed the majority of people come to class, maybe have a coffee catchup, and then go home. That suits me perfectly, but if you\u2019re someone who wants to be out everyday, close to a range of activities, HWU probably isn\u2019t for you. \n\nAll in all though, the uni is quite good. My management/business courses have always been fantastic with brilliant lecture halls and lecturers. My psychology classes, on the other hand, leave a lot to be desired. \n\nPM me if you have any specific questions!! Hope this was helpful.",

The first year is the foundation course where students from non-Computer Science background are taught the basics. Since I had completed my Bachelors in Computer Science, I was shifted to the 1 year course which consisted of purely Masters curriculum. The second year curriculum of Masters for non-CS is the same as the 1 year curriculum of Masters for CS students..",

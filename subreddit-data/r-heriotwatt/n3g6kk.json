    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nThis is my first time ever posting on reddit, I hope you can help me \\^\\^\n\nNext september I'll start an MSc in Edinburgh and I am now considering what type of accomodation fits me the best. I have read that many people recommend to stay on campus for the first year in university because it is easier to meet new people and get involved in university life. Nevertheless, I am not feeling very enthusiastic about living on campus, and I am leaning towards sharing a flat, so that I would be closer to the city life. Are there any 2nd year or old MSc students around that could share their experience to help me decide? In addition to that, in the case that I would like to rent a room, what areas/neighborhoods do you recommend that are not very far from the campus and are not very expensive?\n\nThank you all!",

If you are looking to party a lot I'd say campus is better than living in the city. You'll meet more people of the same age who are there for the same reason. It's a 30-40 minute bus to the centre of town which may seem like alot but it really isn't. Buses run all night as well so its really not difficult to get to and from campus. \n\nIf you prefer to work harder and enjoy the city in your downtime then living in the city works. The only thing I dont like is busing in for a 9am class. Its rush hour, buses get full, its not great. \n\nIf you are going to live in the city, there is private student accommodation. This is a good middle ground as you'll meet students but they might go to different uni's.\n\nAnyway, hope this helps!",

To be honest, now that you said it, it'd be worse (IMO) to have to use public transport every day in rush hour when I am still trying to wake up than just during the day when there is fewer people using it. I also read that the supermarket in the campus is quite expensive and doesn't have much variety. Is there an OK supermarket within reasonable walking/cycling distance?",

There\u2019s a Tesco\u2019s that is about 20 mins away including a walk and bus, and ALDI which can be about a 20 minute cycle. Do a weekly shop and your sorted for the week- your flat mates may even end up having a car to make it even easier!",

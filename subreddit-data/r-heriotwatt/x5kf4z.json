    "postText": "I'm a new student, and I'm doing the welcome week starting from Monday. One of the events on monday is that I have to meet my Personal Tutor, and that the PT will contact me via email, yet they have now emailed me the location of where they will meet me, nor do I know who they are. I looked at my student record and it seems that I haven't been assigned one yet, which is weird since I'm supposed to meet them on Monday. Am I missing something here or...?",

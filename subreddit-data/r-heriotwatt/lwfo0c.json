    "postText": "Hi, I'm a current year 13 student currently considering coming to Heriot Watt to do an undergrad degree, and I just wanted to ask about accommodation. What do most people do for their first year? The only option seemingly available on the website is to live on campus, but from what I've seen other people saying I get the impression that a lot of people choose to live in the city instead, based on how far the campus is from the city. Could someone just clear this up for me? Which option is more popular?\n\nThanks.",

On-campus is the best choice for 1st year I'd say as it's less stressful than a private flat/student halls and also makes it much easier to get to lectures. It's also a lot better for getting to know other people in your 1st year and a lot of the time it'll be the people you meet in halls that'll go onto be your future flatmates",

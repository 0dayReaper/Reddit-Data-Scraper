I don't wanna lose the offer. (I feel I got a useless certificate for the UAE)  \n\n\n\\- I found it is not accredited after my 3rd semester.",

There is one way you could just try for a shorter degree/certification from an Emarati university, keeping your main degree still from HWU. But that may be inferiot, and by that time you might have just lost the opportunity for a govt job.",

I found about that in my 3rd semester.\nIt was a waste of time and money, I asked about it and I have been told that HWD are too lazy to get the accreditation. Its better to join an accredited institution such as Birmingham.\n\nI am happy that I still have my bachelor degree from an accredited university which I can use it in the uae and abroad.",

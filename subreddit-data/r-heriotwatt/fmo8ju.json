I\u2019m from Edinburgh and everything but I\u2019m concerned that HWU is going to be like Edinburgh uni where everyone looks down on you. Is there a level of integration of people or will there be hard times fitting in??\n\nAnyway, see you fuckers in September.",

University is a lot less hierarchical than school because there's too many people to know everybody, a lot of days walking through HWU you don't even recognise their faces.  \n\nFurthermore, it's the first time in your life where the more you put in the more you will get out.  I was told this about High-school but it's bad advice then because most people just think you're a loser for trying.  University that isn't the case, there's much less judgement (unless you hang around these types of people, but they usually drop-out before the end of first year because they don't fit in - go figure!).  Most people won't know you unless you get involved, so my advice is to find out what your interests are and join clubs and societies and try to find people who are likeminded by talking to them about these.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr - you get what you give",

The Chaplaincy is also a nice place to meet new people. There they do soup (afternoon) and dinner (6pm) on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively for one pound.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions. Things should calm down by September for when you'll be enrolled. All the best!",

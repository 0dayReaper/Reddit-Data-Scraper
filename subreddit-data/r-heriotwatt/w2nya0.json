I keep finding only engineering recs, nothing on business. Thanks!",

With your preference in Marketing, you'll find several useful courses throughout your time at HW Dubai.\n\nMost of the assignments are Essays, and some are group presentation/video projects. So it really exposes you to team-building practice. In your case, several of your courseworks will ask you to conduct commercially viable market analysis on different industries.\n\nI have no way of comparing the engineering programs to business, its so apples and oranges. If you want a more secure and lucrative career path, then obviously engineering is a better choice. No use pretending otherwise.\n\nCareer center gets the job done, many universities dont even have one.",

I had applied for BS Computer Science and would like to know if it will be worth it studying Computer Science at Heriot Watt Dubai.\n\nIf you are graduate/current student at HWUD, I would really use any kind of advice you\u2019ll give and please share the insights and your own review.\n\nThank you",

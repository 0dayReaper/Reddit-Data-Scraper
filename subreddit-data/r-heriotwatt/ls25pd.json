Also, which university has better employebility rate among these two in construction management. Also , if there is any other better university i should choose instead of these two? Please can any one guide me through this?",

            "comment": "Hi I've seen you post this before and feel I can maybe give some advice, I've studied at both uni's although not in a similar pathway so I can't give any specific advice regarding construction management (although I will say I believe a placement year and internship year mean the same thing). Both are great uni's and I've had different but enjoyable experiences at each. Not sure if cost is a factor for you but Belfast is a much cheaper city to live in than Edinburgh. The Queen's campus is much closer to the centre and there's still a lot going on (outside of covid times) despite Belfast's smaller size. HWU is based about 7 miles outside of Edinburgh's centre but bus connections are regular and fairly reliable. Edinburgh is an incredible city, with much to do and incredible connections to the outdoors if that's your thing. Sorry I can't give any course specific advice but I hope this is something!",

Im at heriot watt although a different course and they've been amazing so far and tbh im absolutely loving living in edinburgh. As long as you dont mind a bus to campus or town (transport network is pretty good) and a bit higher cost of living its a great place to be.",

So,please can you tell something about the above two mentioned points.",

In august a ton of new bars and places open  for the month so i got experience from that and that let me get a part time job pretty easily. I know my friends who are looking for placements dont seem to be having any issues but thats about all i know. Heriot watt being a campus uni they also have a fair about of jobs they employ students in to keep the shop and society pub running and if you get one of those first year it works great since youll be living very close by",

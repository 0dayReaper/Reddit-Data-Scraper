Decent charge on their charging case so likely haven't been here for too long. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've still got them in the learning commons but I will be handing them into the student shop when I leave. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're missing a pair and can give the brand and colours of the case and the buds themselves, come and get them.",

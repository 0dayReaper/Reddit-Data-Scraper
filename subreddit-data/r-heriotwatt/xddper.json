    "postText": "I'm an upcoming international student for the January intake and I am a bit concerned that I might not get an on-campus accommodation, because when I was checking the website I found that there is an on-campus housing guarantee only for the September intake students, and I suspect that those rooms get filled up very rapidly, right? So are their usually rooms left for January intake students?",

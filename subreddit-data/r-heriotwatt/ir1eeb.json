    "postText": "Hi folks, hopefully someone that's in the know will see this. \n\nMy girlfriend left applying for a part time masters really really late, and sent her application off a couple of weeks ago and HW got back and said they need another document, she sent that off 1 week ago. The HW class calendar starts on Monday and she's not heard anything back other than the confirmation they received the 2nd set of documents (on the day she sent them). \n\nIs there any likelihood shes still in with a chance, or should we expect a rejection email on Monday? Will HW even send a rejection email as I didn't receive one from a masters I was waiting listed for this year (at a different university).\n\nRight now we're both resigned to she applied too late and didn't get in, but I find it strange they haven't even sent an update before the course starts? My girlfriend is also totally qualified and suitable for the course, holding the same undergraduate degree plus professional work experience of 2 of the modules, and I was always under the impression universities want masters students because the class numbers are smaller and of course the fact Uni's love money.\n\nAnyway, hopefully someone can give us an idea of what's going on? \n\nCheers!",

Pretty sure I had people joining my course in October in 1st year (although this may be different for a masters as opposed to undergraduate)",

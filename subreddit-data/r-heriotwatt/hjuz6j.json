On the strikes I don't think they went on long enough to trigger any compensation, I know Edi Uni is giving some money to those who pay tuition but their strikes also lasted longer I believe.\n\nOn COVID the  uni will be completely covered by the fact it  was  out of their control and was essentially  an \"act  of god\".\n\nHope that helps :)",

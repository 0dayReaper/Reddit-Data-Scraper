    "postText": "It has been more than a month since I applied for the issuance of my CAS number and letter. I'm getting more anxious everyday since my course will be starting early September and I still got tons of documents to be done and even apply for my student VISA. I've less than 3 weeks to prepare everything but my CAS letter is still pending. Does anyone know what do I have to do or like what's going on in the university? Is this a normal thing to happen? So far waiting for my CAS has been extremely painful, need help :(",

    "postText": "Hi, first off, I am considering entering Heriott Watt Malaysia, and statistical data science is among the courses offered. I love mathematics, but also am okay with computer science, so that\u2019s why i\u2019m considering statistical data science. However, i\u2019m hesitant as HW\u2019s course focuses more on the statistical side of data science, as opposed to the computer science aspect. As a student taking such a course, I would appreciate your review on it as well as the reason why you chose a more statistical degree over a computer sciency one. As a maths enthusiast, would I benefit from this course or should I focus on computer science because of its current demand? Thank you.",

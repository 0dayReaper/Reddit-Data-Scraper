    "postText": "If I were a foreign student, paying thousands for this tuition, I\u2019d be pissed. This is shameful. I know someone who went to college here in Scotland and the notes they are given are beautifully done booklets and power points. Many of my classes notes are thrown together as quickly as possible because lectures can\u2019t seemly be bothered. I have left this feedback in the student survey and I doubt it\u2019ll make any difference.",

When lecturers have to change things last minute or make it up as they go along teaching the course, you can expect 90% that notes would be hand-written. Crappy or not is just a game of luck. You just have to ask the module leader politely for a clearer version if it's a common problem and multiple students complaint about it.",

            "comment": "Assuming you mean conditional offer rather than contextual? then it is very much dependent on what subject you're looking at studying and also dependent on your personal statement that you write for your application as grades are only part of it.\n\nYour A and 5 B's are likely to meet the minimum entry requirements for most courses however. The specific requirements can be seen on each courses page which you can search for on the [Heriot-Watt website](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/study/undergraduate/).",

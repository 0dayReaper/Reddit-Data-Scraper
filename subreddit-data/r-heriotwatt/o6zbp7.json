    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m starting at Herriot Watt in September and I\u2019m booking my accommodation right now. I\u2019m trying to decide between the contemporary 5 bedroom flat, and the contemporary room with kitchen shared by ten people.\n\nSo essentially, I imagine one is a self contained flat with 5 people and the other would be just rooms along a corridor and there would be a kitchen shared by ten people separate from the rooms.\n\nApart from the the five bedroom flat being slightly more expensive, has anyone got any thoughts on which would be better?\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Hey, when I was in first year I stayed in the 5 bedroom expensive ones. They are the nicest living space flats. My main problem was that you get a lot of older students or just people who are less likely to be sociable. Where as in the 10 bedroom ones you are meeting more people and from my experience much more sociable people. \n\nSo I say it depends what you want. If you want a quieter space where you can work hard, you'd be better off in the 5 bedroom. If you want to party more go for the 10 bedrooms. That being said, it's not a guarantee either way. You could have social flatmates in either but from my experience there's more happening in the 10 bedroom flats. \n\nHope this helped if you have any more questions I'll do my best to help out!",

Also the kitchen is bigger in the 10 bedroom flats. From the flats I visited the kitchens were always clean. People tend to be good about that in first year but it just comes down to who you end up living with. You do have cleaners that will come and mop the floors and sometimes the surfaces so it's normally fine.",

My only concern is that people might not take ownership of the shared kitchen space as it\u2019s external from the rooms. Did you have any problem with people not tidying up after themselves? I know you can expect that anyways but just wondering if you thought that was more of a problem. Thanks",

At the beginning the place was usually such a mess, but only caused by a handful of people, but after this was pointed out to them this generally became less of an issue. Also, bear in mind that the kitchen is proportionally very small for 12 people",

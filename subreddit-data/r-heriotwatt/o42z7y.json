I personally didnt want to skip because i dont like being really clueless but uk it saves a lot of money.\n\n\nUpdate :\n\nFirst year they teach them basic java, c language in terms of programming. There were a lot of practical stuff from what i have heard.\n\nI was a direct entry student and i didnt find it super challenging. Java was a pain in the second sem(Y2), but a lot of the non-direct entry students found it difficult.\n\n (do note i did program in python before so l did have some experience with coding.)\n\nAs for theory,  a lot of the professors expained everything from scratch. So i did not find it challenging to keep up with the class.",

            "comment": "Hey, so im a computer science student but I do believe we share modules like software development. If you find the course page on the Heriot-Watt website, there should be a detailed course guide. You can see exactly what individual modules you'll do and if you go through the link to that modules guide, it should tell you exactly what you'll be learning. \n\nWe focused on Java on our course but tbh first year is pretty simple. If you are a solid programmer than you can skip first year but it is very helpful with the fundamentals.\n\nLet me know if you need anything else and I'll do my best to answer.",

I searched it on the net and nothing came up. \n\nAlso there is 'software development 1' and 'software development 2' in the first year. Is that too in c language or java? \n\nIm soo sorry for asking soo many questions. I just dont want to walk in absolutely clueless.",

Software development is all java but they teach it from the very beginning. Brushing up on any object oriented language will make this alot easier. \n\nDon't worry about the questions, ask away. It's literally been my job to talk about our course to future students",

It's only in year 4 that you do specific data science courses. Again I'd follow my first comment to find out exactly what courses you'll be taking but it will all be related. \n\nYou will use python sometimes but we only did once for about a month. I found you get taught more about the fundamentals so it becomes really easy to pick up new languages. \n\nHope this helps",

This would appear to be a introduction to the OOP world and so I would'nt worry yourself too much with learning ahead of time as you should be able to build the foundations required in this class. I would presume through looking through other courses and information read on the website it would be Java, but I could be wrong. \n\nIn semester 2 of first year, we have \"Praxis Programming\", which seems to be an introduction to the C programming language, which will be used to interact with embedded electronic systems further down the line. From what I gather again this seems like it would be fairly introductory and so you could go in with little working knowledge of C, but could be useful to learn basic syntax and familiarise yourself with the most popular IDE for C development(unsure if the uni will use this or will have set up a self-contained programming environment for us too use). \n\nWe also have in semester 2 \"Software Development 2\", where we build upon the skills we learned from SD1 in semester 1, so again I wouldnt worry too much about this. \n\nAs far as first year goes this would appear to be all the software work we will be undertaking, I hope if you had not already cleared your concerns/queries up I was able to help do so. \n\nOn top of that feel free to reach on through DM if you want to chat to chat/get to know someone before the year begins.",

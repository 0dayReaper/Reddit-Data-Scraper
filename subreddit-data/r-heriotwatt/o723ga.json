Does anyone have anything they would recommend me to do or any places or people that could help point me in the right direction to finding flatmates or any accommodation in the city that may have students in the same position as me looking to move in?",

If you prefer a flat instead of student accommodation, then there are websites and apps for finding room mates you can use. I think there's plenty of Facebook groups for finding people in similar situations as well. \n\nHope this helps, I've not used any of these services so I'm not entirely sure how it goes but if you have any more questions I can try and help out.",

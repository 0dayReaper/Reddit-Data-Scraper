    "postText": "Hi,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am currently a 2nd year Computer Science BSc student and my exam results didn't go as planned. I would like to retake 2nd year and give it another go before trying to get into 3rd year as well. I have spoke with staff about this issue already. I'm just wondering if anyone has done this before and if I could get a little bit of insight into what might actually happen? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you\n\nBrendan",

They should change your year automatically if you've already applied. \n\nMy experience of repeating a year has been that very little changes if you take the same approach. \n\nI know a lot of people really struggled with your course this year so make use of your lecturers' office hours, tutorials, etc. \n\nMy advice would be to identify what went well and what could have gone better and keep that in mind throughout both semesters. I'd really recommend reaching out to the university and/or student union services you feel might be relevant to your situation. They can help with almost any problem that might impact your studies.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to message me if you don't feel comfortable posting them here...",

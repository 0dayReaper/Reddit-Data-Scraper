I have applied for the CAS certificate on 15th July. I want to know about the covid lockdown situatuon in Edinburgh, the cost of housing if I'm accompanied by 2 of my friends, the quarantine costs, and any other information you people feel is relevant.\nThanks.",

            "comment": "Hey, so in Edinburgh there are some restrictions but nothing too major. Basically just wear a mask while walking around inside public buildings. So like shops and restaurants and stuff. If you are outside or sat at a table somewhere you don't have to wear a mask.\n https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-protection-levels/ \n\nI'd look here for more info. Edinburgh is currently in level 0 but keep an eye out as that might change.\n\nThe university have said they want as much in person teaching as they are allowed in the coming year but the first semester will be available to be done from home. So campus might have some restrictions too for the first semester.\n\nI terms of housing for 3 people that can range anywhere from \u00a3300 to \u00a3800 per person per month. If you want to live reasonably city centre you can find nice flats for around \u00a3500 per person per month. There is alot cheaper places the further out of the city you go, just watch how difficult that makes the commute to campus.\n\nHope this helps! If you have any other questions just comment and I'll try to answer as best I can.",

Check your university notice boards too. Other students can give you tips.",

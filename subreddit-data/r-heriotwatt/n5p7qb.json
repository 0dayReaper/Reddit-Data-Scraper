    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI'm a current year 13 student looking at Heriot Watt's marine biology course, and I just wanted to know if anyone has any experience with it; specifically, I'm just surprised at how low the entry grades are- HW is apparently ranked in the top 30 in the UK for biological sciences, and yet the entry grades for marine biology are only BCC. It just seems too good to be true. If you have any experience with this course- what's it like? Is it worth it? \n\nThank you.",

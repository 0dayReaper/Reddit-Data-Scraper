            "comment": "&gt; A UNIVERSITY professor paid himself into a children\u2019s swim disco and followed youngsters around a changing room, a trial heard yesterday.\n\n&gt; Peter Ridges allegedly watched girls entering changing cubicles before wandering into neighbouring cubicles himself.\n\n&gt;Perth Sheriff Court was shown CCTV footage of Ridges in swimming shorts in the changing area. Prosecutors said he was looking at children aged eight to 14 at Perth Leisure Pool, before deciding which cubicle he should enter next.\n\n&gt;When the children exited after changing, Ridges is alleged to have left the adjacent cubicle shortly after.\n\n&gt;Pool staff said they thought it odd that a lone adult would attend the swim disco.\n\n&gt;Police were called in February 2020 when Ridges, from Edinburgh, turned up on the corresponding weekend exactly a year later and was recognised by staff.\n\n&gt;Duty manager Susan Chmiel said: \u2018We contacted the police about a gentleman who was at the pool acting suspiciously. We believed he was looking predominantly at girls in the changing rooms.\u2019\n\n&gt;Ridges, 59, a professor of maths at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, denies breaching the peace by loitering around the changing area on both occasions, and recording \u2018by unknown means\u2019.\n\n&gt;Ridges also denies watching and following children, then watching them enter changing cubicles before entering an adjacent cubicle himself. He further denies leaving cubicles after the children exited.\n\n&gt;The trial continues.\n\n\\^\\^^ Some of the story that was published in the Courier earlier this year, more recent updates from the conclusion of the trial and his admitting to the charges are still behind a paywall.",

            "comment": "From the Courier:\n\n#Maths professor admits following children around Perth pool changing area\n\nA university professor has admitted following children around changing rooms at a Perth Leisure Pool disco and listening to them while they swapped into their swimwear.\n\nStaff at the Glasgow Road facility were puzzled when lecturer Peter Ridges paid himself into one of the pool\u2019s Saturday night kids\u2019 discos.\n\nAnd they called the police when he returned exactly a year later.\n\nThe 59-year-old was seen on CCTV wandering around the changing area in just a pair of shorts.\n\nThe footage shows Ridges, a Maths Professor at Heriot Watt University, watching young girls going into a cubicle before going into the booth next door.\n\nWhen the children finished changing and came out, Ridges is seen to exit the adjacent cubicle shortly after \u2013 wearing exactly the same thing he had on when he entered.\n\n#Not sexual\n\nRidges went on trial at Perth Sheriff Court in June. He initially denied two charges of conducting himself in a disorderly manner and breaching the peace on February 9, 2019, and again on February 8, 2020.\n\nBut on Tuesday \u2013 the second day of his trial \u2013 he pleaded guilty to amended charges.\n\nHis solicitor Gary McAteer said his client had changed his plea \u201con the basis that charges contain no significant sexual element.\u201d\n\nPart of the allegations that claimed Ridges was also recording in the changing area \u201cby unknown means\u201d was withdrawn by prosecutors.\n\nMr McAteer said that Ridges\u2019 behaviour was \u201codd\u201d and \u201ceccentric\u201d but not sexual.\n\n\u201cHe has no criminal record,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHis intention at this time was to simply heat up after a days walking in the hills.\u201d\n\nMr McAteer said that a background report had suggested his client was \u201con the spectrum\u201d and that his behaviour is eccentric.\n\nSheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred sentence until October 17 for further reports.\n\n#Concerned staff called police\n\nStaff at the pool said that Ridges never actually went for a swim during his visits.\n\nReception worker Fiona Pallister, 44, told the trial: \u201cIt\u2019s the kids\u2019 disco on a Saturday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s full of children with loud music.\n\n\u201cNot many people come in on their own.\u201d\n\nShe told the court: \u201cHe said he was meeting somebody down in the leisure pool, so he wanted to go down there.\n\n\u201cHe just asked for a swim. I just thought it was very odd.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t sitting right with me.\u201d\n\nShe said a colleague had gone to check on him and noticed that he never went into the pool.\n\n\u201cHe was just in the changing rooms the whole time and round the toilets,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe came up the stairs without his shoes on.\n\n\u201cHe put his shoes on and left.\u201d\n\nMs Pallister recognised Ridges when he came back a year later.\n\nShe called the police.\n\nThe court was told Ridges disappeared into a toilet when officers arrived and after \u201caround ten minutes\u201d officers went in to tell him to come out.",

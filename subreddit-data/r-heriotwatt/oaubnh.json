I did A level May June 2021 so my results come on August 10th. Any idea what grade you would get in May June? basically your predicted grades. Idk about communication design but for engineering the requirements are CCD for first year and BBC for second year. And this representative told me that they are accepting predicted grades and stuff only for local boards from India and not for Cambridge and IB. Did you pay your deposit yet? I am applying from Chennai, India. Wbu?",

If your final grade is ACCD (during august) or CCD I am sure you wont be having any problem in getting into first year. If it goes to CCE or any worst case scenario, you can try negotiating with them or do a foundation year. You can secure your seat and keep it. If they are like they wont give and all (god forbid ) they would refund it. This zoom meeting is where reps from the uni will explain everything and you can ask them any questions you have. Tbh you can ask them regarding this also before paying if you want assurance tom in the meeting.",

    "postText": "Hey HW students, I'm currently in a band in Edinburgh and my guitar teacher suggested that the Student Union could be a good shout for getting gigs if we are struggling for venues, just wondering assuming you could do with some live music again.  \n\n\nUnsure if bands really play Student Unions again these days but I was told by my GT that HW was a good vibe for playing music to students (keep in mind this was like circa summer 2000)",

In terms of actually gigging there I\u2019ve never seen them do shows but might be worth sending an email to the student union president.",

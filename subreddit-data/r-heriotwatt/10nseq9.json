I've been considering shared living as an option since it'd probably be cheaper, any advice would be really appreciated!",

            "comment": "Heriot Watt have accommodation on campus, they have an accommodation section on their website that shows the rooms and weekly rent etc. I know a couple of people who are doing masters and went for accommodation on campus, mostly because it's very cheap for Edinburgh. The cheapest rooms are pretty small but they do the job.\n\nYou could always advertise on Heriot watt's Facebook page for shared accommodation, I've seen a few people do that. You could look up student accommodation and flats for an idea of how much you'd pay for rent in the city itself, it will be more expensive than on campus if you're living alone, but if you're sharing with a flatmate it will often work out cheaper. And living in the city itself is of course beneficial as you're closer to the centre and nightlife etc. Heriot Watt's campus isn't far from the city by any means, its about a half hour bus ride and they operate 24/7 and up to every five minutes or so, but it does mean you're paying for the bus every time you want to go into the city centre.",

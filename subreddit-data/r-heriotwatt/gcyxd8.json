    "postText": "Hello, I would like to know how is the relationship between Edinburgh Uni and Heriot Watt. Is it normal for a student to pursue a study in one of them and then start another program in the other university?\n\nI'm asking because I want to study Artificial Intelligence at Edinburgh University but I did not get accepted. However I got accepted for Data Science at Heriot Watt, so I'm considering to start with DS at Heriot Watt and apply again to Edinburgh University once I finish Data Science.\n\nWould you recommend me to do so? Or is there any kind of  issue to start at Heriot Watt and then go to Edinburgh University?",

            "comment": "(Disclaimer: I do AI research at Edinburgh uni)\n\nI'm assuming you're talking about undergraduate degrees. Edinburgh Uni is world class for AI, as you probably know since you're interested in going there, but Heriot Watt is very good as well, though the department is smaller. Notably, if you're interested in natural language processing (NLP) down the line, the conversational AI team at Heriot-Watt is extremely good and very well respected.\n\nRegarding the links, I'd say that there are quite a lot in certain areas, and not many in others. Robotics at Edinburgh&amp;Heriot-Watt is very closely linked, and the NLP people interact a bunch too. The Edinburgh (and, more broadly, Scottish) research community is relatively small and there's plenty of events to get to meet everyone, so most researchers tend to be aware of what's going on at the other unis if it touches their area.\n\nChoosing to go to Heriot-Watt would, at worse, not put you in any worse a situation to do a master's at Edinburgh later on, and in practice it's quite likely that you could end up interacting with HW academics with ties to Edinburgh University, which, depending on your specialty, could provide you with very valuable references.",

Do you have an undergrad in CS/Data Science topics already?\n\nAre you interested in ending up in a specific area of research that Edinburgh is good at, no matter what? If so, considering going to Edinburgh Uni at all costs could make sense as it's one one of the very top institutions in Europe. For most other purposes, or even if you're interest in research but not 100% sure, I'm not sure if it makes sense. Heriot-Watt is far from being bad, and the job market for AI/DS is good enough that you're unlikely to struggle getting a job and slowly progressing towards the niche you like.",

It could be both at Heriot Watt or Edinburgh, or even online, that's why I was asking the relationship between both. I'm now considering the MSc in Data Science as the required step for formalizing the skills I lack in order to jump towards AI. \n\nMaking two masters seems way too costly and time consuming, but I wanted to know the options just in case Data Science doesn't give me what I'm expecting.",

I know from hearsay that Edinburgh's taught AI master's are very popular and they do tend to have to reject people for lack of formal pre-requisites (research programmes are different and a lot more attention is given to your overall profile).\n\nI'd definitely advise against two masters, which would cost a lot of money in both fees and opportunity cost. Heriot-Watt does have an Artificial Intelligence masters that I'm not personally familiar with but have heard some good things about a couple of the courses. You could try to contact admissions and ask if you could transfer your acceptance for the DS MSc to the AI MSc, if you feel like the programme structure would be a better fit for you.\n\nIf you do go to Heriot-Watt and are at all interested in speech processing, definitely pick *Conversational Agents and Spoken Language Processing* as one of your courses, it's taught (or at least was taught in the past, I'm not 100% up to speed) by some of the world's best conversational AI academics. On top of it, its assessment system is fantastic and it's constantly updated to cover state-of-the-art topics.",

I'll look for those courses at HW and definetely consider NLP, which I find really exciting!\n\nAs many people have adviced, two masters may be not recommended, so I may consider moving into research after my MSc.",

There will probably be a way you could masters in artificial intelligence after doing something like data science here but that's something you'd have to check with Edinburgh uni.",

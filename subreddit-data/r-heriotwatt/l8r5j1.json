            "comment": "Hey, i used to stay in the university dorms. It was great and we had no curfew. Area was a bit far from the main city but if you could get a cab or a friend with a car perhaps, its all good. Where are you staying as campus doesn\u2019t offer direct accommodation anymore. Extra curriculars, depends. if you\u2019re into sports, you could try out for the team as for arts, im not really sure\nHope this answers your queries :)",

And many drunk students will join you on your way after 10pm.\n\nNightlife is great, I've worked in 2 nightclubs here and you'll get a lot of different opinions on which are the best but you'll find a favourite.\n\nExtra curricular s are alright and there's plenty of societies. \n\nNever stayed in halls but spent plenty of time in them, you'll either get old prison or modern nice. They're renovating them at the minute. There are parties in the halls shared living rooms, I remember when everyone was snowed in and they were the best.\n\nI never planned to come here, I wanted to go to Queen's Belfast but when they gave me the offer at the end of first year I decided I'd stay here and it's been great, you'll love the city as well",

            "comment": "Congrats on applying! Heriot-Watt's an excellent uni and a fine choice for a firm offer.\n\nThe accommodation is a mixed bag. Halls named after women are nice, but the ones named for men range from dated to abysmal. Learn to cook and get self-catered accommodation because the food on campus is pretty terrible (except for Geordies, which is good but pretty unhealthy), and HW is not in the delivery radius of many restaurants.\n\nThe area is very nice (walking distance from the Pentlands!) but isolated, and it's about 40 minutes from the city center by bus or 20 minutes by car. Pretty much everyone I know moved east of campus their second year.\n\nThere's a nightclub called Zeros on campus that does theme nights most weekends. Those are usually pretty fun.\n\nHeriot-Watt has a decent selection of extracurriculars for a uni of 10,000, mostly sport and music. You can find a complete list of societies [here](https://www.hwunion.com/get-involved/societies).",

            "comment": "I stayed on-campus in 2018 for my first year. Can confirm direct accomodation from  the uni is still a thing. It is quite far from edi centre but there's regular buses to the city so still easy to get to, probs roughly 40 mins. During freshers there's always tons of different pres to go to before events but after that things tend to calm down. There is the on-campus union but it's definitely more of a pub than a club",

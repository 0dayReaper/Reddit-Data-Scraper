    "postText": "Hiii I am currently looking for international students studying in Scotland to participate in my dissertation research about international students' understandings of mental health, help-seeking behaviours, and how well they have adapted to Scottish culture. We are hoping to publish the findings so to improve mental health services at universities across Scotland for international students by making them more easily accessible for them. The questionnaire link is below, and it should take around 15 minutes and is completely anonymous:\n\nhttps://hass.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8H5g8cFKROQG0bX\n\nThank you very much for your help!",

            "comment": "1. Unconditional means now you have nothing to worry about. The university will be contacting you soon about the fee payment plan and visa processing.\n\n2. You don\u2019t have to learn anything ig. Just have a look through the detailed course and be familiar with what modules you\u2019re gonna have.\n\n3. HWUD is accredited by the British something something. It doesn\u2019t have a UAE accreditation but tht doesn\u2019t matter. UAE accredited universities are forced to teach Arabic and Islamic as part of the course. \n\nI\u2019m also going to join Heriot watt Dubai this year for BSc Hons computer science with data science. Since the syllabus is the same across all branches, going to uk wouldn\u2019t really help unless you really want to go to. Anyways look forward to meeting you\ud83d\ude0a",

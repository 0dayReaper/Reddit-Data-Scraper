Options I'm considering are:\n\n- Critical Writing and Analysis\n- TESOL 1\n- Applied Linguistics 1\n- Translation Technologies for Professional Translators (I am very interested in this one, but availability is supposedly 'extremely limited')\n\nI would love to hear about your experiences with and/or advice about any of these courses!",

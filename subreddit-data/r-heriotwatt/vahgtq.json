    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm considering distance learning study of the above course after completing a BEng (Hons) with the Open University. Unlike the OU, I cannot find much information on the course's specific modules, so I'm reaching out to see if anyone else has studied this and find out their thoughts about the subjects (whether it was taught remotely or not).\n\nFor anyone who has studied via distance learning with HW on another course, how was it? were exams in person, remote or non-existent? \n\nThanks :)",

You shouldn't need any text books. \n\nJava is the main programming language we use most of the time but robotics might do some other ones on top of java I'm not sure.\n\nShouldn't need to do any summer prep it's all taught from basics but learning abit wouldn't hurt. Most of the modules are easy to follow and have good lecturers.",

Just to confirm, is this the course you\u2019re doing: https://www.hw.ac.uk/study/uk/undergraduate/robotics-autonomous-and-interactive-systems-meng.htm \n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t bother with buying textbooks (at least for the first and second year), maybe try to find some free pdfs online if you wanted. And in terms of preparation over summer: not really needed, just research bits that interest you. \n\nFor during the year, just make you sure you keep on top of the lecture notes, and do all of the tutorials / labs (even if unmarked!) and you\u2019ll be fine. \n\nGood luck with your course!",

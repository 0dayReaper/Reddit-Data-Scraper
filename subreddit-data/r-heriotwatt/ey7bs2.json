I was just wondering if anyone had some websites or just any advice on what we should be doing because I feel like we should be getting a flat soon. Thanks",

            "comment": "So in Scotland there's a thing called a PRT Agreement (Private Residential Tenancy) that came in about 2 years ago which states that there's no end lease on tenancy agreements anymore. What this means is that landlords have little knowledge of when tenants will move out until they're  told by the tenants, so landlords cant rent properties for specific periods, i.e Sept-May, like they used to. This means nowadays that landlords cant advertise properties till the  previous tenants have actually given  them notice that they're leaving. So if you're looking for properties to movie in August/September then you'll probably get none till about July or in my case till August. Although none of this is for certain as I know a few people who did manage to get flats at this time of year with August move-in dates. So really its just a case of looking at Rightmove or Zoopla constantly and waiting. Little tip if you can be bothered is to look at letting agents websites directly as sometimes they don't advertise all their properties on Rightmove or Zoopla. Some big letting agents are Braemore, Southside and Umega.",

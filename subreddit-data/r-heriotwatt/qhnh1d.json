    "postText": "I am part of a team that aims to guide and help international students. If you are currently studying abroad in the UK it would be really helpful if you could fill out the survey below. It is quick to fill out and the responses will be used for research purposes only so that we can provide a higher standard of support and will be kept entirely confidential and anonymous. By filling out the questionnaire you will also be entered for a chance to win an exciting black Friday voucher! \n\n[https://form.typeform.com/to/WgBbMkSF?typeform-source=www.google.com](https://form.typeform.com/to/WgBbMkSF?typeform-source=www.google.com)\n\nMany thanks!",

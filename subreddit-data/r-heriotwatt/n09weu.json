            "comment": "It\u2019s a great mix of a campus uni with a city right next door. The bus into the centre of Edinburgh takes about 35-40 minute (on a good day) and is relatively cheap. The university is close-knit and I found it pretty easy to make friends through both my course and accommodation. Talking of accommodation, the more expensive it is, the better it is I\u2019m afraid, but even for the cheaper ones, you can make it a home pretty easily. In terms of shopping, that is a pain, with the campus shop the only one on campus, with the nearest supermarket about a 25-30 minute walk along the canal",

Oriam is part of the Herriot Watt campus and university but is also the training centre for pretty much all of Scotland\u2019s nations sports teams and Heart of Midlothian Football Club. It will also act as a training base for the Czech national team during the Euros",

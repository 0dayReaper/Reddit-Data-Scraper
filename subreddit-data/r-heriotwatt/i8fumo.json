    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been spending my lockdown going on walks, and more specifically trying to find geocaches wherever I go! I have been to many different places since lockdown began, and I noticed that the University of St Andrews Geocaching Society had placed one and I thought it could be a good idea if maybe I could make a Geocaching Society for Heriot Watt. Would anyone be interested in that? It would basically just involve going out to find geocaches, adding our own geocaches, and having a load of social nights to relax / have fun!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.geocaching.com/play](https://www.geocaching.com/play)",

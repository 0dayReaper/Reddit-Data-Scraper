The uni is great for foreigners, i am not personally one but i know lots of people who are and they thoroughly enjoy it here. The campus is great and open and has a variety of culture.\n\n2. I am not personally studying IB, but my flatmate is, and he recommends the course a lot.\n\n3. There is on-campus accommodation for first years which you can apply for online, otherwise there are flats in the city however they are quite tricky to get due to lots of people trying to move in (im currently in the middle of trying to move out of campus accom into city centre and its painful)\n\n4. The on campus student union is a decent place, as well as the many nightclubs in the city. I recommend the Hive personally, im there every tuesday for emo/punk music and its a great vibe\nAdditionally the E-Sports society is very good for meeting people, they do freshers week activities and are very active and friendly :)\n\nEdit: I\u2019m at the Edinburgh Campus",

There are multiple bus stops on campus and the 25,34,35 busses go right through city centre and theres at least one every 10 mins or so. If you move to scotland you can apply for a Young Scot Card, and those give under 22\u2019s free busses so you can get anywhere for free which is very ideal.",

    "postText": "I am from the US, I want to study at HW Edinburgh in Fall 2023. I just recently decided this, so I'm super later to the whole application process and I'm kind of panicking that I'm TOO late. I just submitted my application (May 14). How long did it take for you to get your offer?\n\nThe deadline to apply is May 31. Obviously that means I could still apply but I'm really stressing I won't be able to get the housing and classes I need because I am late nonetheless. Housing is required to be on campus, so supply is limited.\n\nI'm kind of panicking haha so some words of advice would help...thanks  \ud83d\ude05",

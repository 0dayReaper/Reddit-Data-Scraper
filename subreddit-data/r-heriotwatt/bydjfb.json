    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI\u2019ve just finished second year and I\u2019ve been constantly applying / attended interviews for temporary and part time jobs for the summer (and hopefully continue when uni starts again). However I seem to be having no luck so just wondering if anyone has some advice for what I can do? If I can\u2019t get a part time job I can\u2019t see how I can continue uni (since I get the lowest SAAS) and how will I get a job after uni if I can\u2019t even get a retail job or something?\n\nThanks for your help!",

The first two are on princes street! \n\nTry use the indeed app and search for part time jobs. \n\nThere\u2019s also internships, I think one at Waverley station. \n\nJust walk around Lothian road, Tollcross and princes street with copies of your CV and look at shops to see if they have a job wanted poster at the front if you have a spare day.\n\nGood luck!",

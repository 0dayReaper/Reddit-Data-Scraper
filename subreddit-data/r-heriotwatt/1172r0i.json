    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm scheduled to start MSc Artificial intelligence at Heriotwatt this September, I have a biomedical engineering background so I wanted to fuse that with AI. How's the prospects? After studying the modules offered, personally I feel they're nice as I think this type of program that caters for non-computing background is only offered by heriotwatt. Any advices!\n\nCheers",

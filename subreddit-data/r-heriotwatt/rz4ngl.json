    "postText": "I\u2019m a Malaysian looking at studying in Scotland (Heriot-Watt University) to do B.Eng Mechanical Engineering. What is some good advice for living and studying in Scotland that I might not have been told by the school? \n\n- How\u2019s the community like? Are the students known to be easy going or do they prefer to keep to themselves?\n\n- What\u2019s the night life like? For someone who doesn\u2019t enjoy pubs much.\n\n- How safe is the area? Is there a lot of discrimination (racial etc) to foreigners? In my case- to Asians.\n\n- I know the University is recognised in the UK. What comes to mind off the top of your head when you hear \u2018HWU\u2019?\n\nAny answers are greatly appreciated! Thanks for your time.",

Quite a bit of hipster places haha.\n\nI'm a 6ft, fairly fat white guy so I can't speak for much on racial hate. I'd say the city is fairly diverse however there are a good few idiots that roam around that could be unkind.\n\nFor me heriot watt is recognised and known more for its science and engineering degrees than much else. It's a very well respected uni for sure!",

            "comment": "I did a BEng Mech Eng and helped run some courses for a couple of years.\n\nThere are a lot of Malaysian students at HWU, there's a campus in Kuala Lumpur so there are a lot of students that come and do a year in Edinburgh, especially 3rd/4th year Mech Eng.\n\nThe area the university in is a bit rowdy at night sometimes because it's only first year students for the most part. I don't drink or anything so can't really recommend much to do in terms of nightlife, although Edinburgh is getting more musical acts coming through instead of having to go through to Glasgow and back (the return journey at night can be challenging as the trains stop relatively early). Unfortunately whilst the student union has many societies, most of them are focussed on getting smashed so you might struggle here if you don't want to do to a pub. It's outside the rest of the city, next to some fairly rough areas (Sighthill, Wester Hailes) but not in them. I would recommend being extra vigilant if you want to have a bike and make sure you have a good bike lock as bikes will disappear. It is a bit of a trek to the nearest supermarket, the shop in the university is ok but fairly expensive and has a fairly small selection at the moment due to Brexit/covid related supply issues, this may be sorted out by the time you start. Regarding accomodation after first year, the campus has very good links to the city centre, including night buses, and some links to West Lothian so you have a lot of choice for somewhere to stay. There is a fairly sizeable East Asian community around Leith Walk in Edinburgh. Unfortunately I cannot help with experiences of racism, like all cities there will be some unfortunately.\n\nHWU is one of (maybe the) best university in Scotland for Mechanical Engineering, only Strathclyde in Glasgow really competes. In England there is a bit more choice in some excellent places like Imperial College London, but tuition fees come into it then. It has pretty excellent industrial links in the oil and gas sector especially, and a fairly sizeable F1-based alumni if that is of interest. It's seen as a bit of a second rate university by some, definitely doesn't have the standing of somewhere like Edinburgh University, but it does regularly beat the other Edinburgh universities on student satisfaction.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nAs part of third year psychology, I'm doing some research looking into students' sense of belonging. If you're currently in second, third, fourth or fifth year of an undergraduate degree at a UK university we'd really appreciate you filling in this questionnaire. It should only take around 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nWe're excluding current first years due to covid19 - sorry! Any nationality is welcome as long as you're 18+, studying at a UK university only, and you're currently in your undergraduate degree at said UK university.\n\nThe questionnaire is hosted on Experimentum which is GDPR compliant and none of your personal data will be stored - if you wish to remove your submitted answers you can also do that by emailing either a student researcher or supervisor listed within the study and telling us your code you're asked to produce at the beginning. Thank you in advance!\n\n[https://exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/project?sob&amp;all](https://exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/project?sob&amp;all)",

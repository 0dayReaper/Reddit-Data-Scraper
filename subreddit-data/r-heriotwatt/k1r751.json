Instead of an application, you submit a \"Course Order/Purchase Form\" and you pay \u00a31,000 each to buy courses.\n\nEntry requirement says, if you do not have an undergrad degree, you can complete 3 courses to gain your entry. But they do not even check whether you have first degree or not?\n\nDoes it feel like anybody could just buy their way in???",

But in a much more inclusive way for people who weren't able or didn't go to university or for whatever reason not able to get those grades at that time.\n\nPersonally I think it's great. Most MBA courses require you to have at least a 2:1 at degree. \n\nE.g. I had a real bad time at uni for a number of reasons and just barely passed, that was 10 years ago. Heriot watt was the only university I could find that meant I didn't have to write some long letter explaining myself for ten years ago and allow me to study based on my actual capabilities now.  \n\nI've been doing the online MBA, incase you have any questions about what it's like, feel free to ask away :)",

                            "comment": "No it's definitely not easier in terms of qualification or skill level!  It's 3 Masters level modules which is harder than an Undergraduate level so in terms of ability it is actually harder than the standard undergraduate entry requirement. For a Masters - you have do to substantially more detailed, and more complex analysis and interpretation compared to an undergrad, as well as demonstrate that you can apply theory into a business context - not just prove you have a certain level of theory. It's why MBA's are normally aimed at people who have business working experience.\n\nSo their entry requirements are still a high barrier for quality. You have to either have an undergrad or pass 3 masters level courses. For equivalency - 3 Masters modules = a Postgraduate Certification. So to enter the course, you either have to have a 2:1 undergraduate (therefore they *assume* you are capable of progressing your learning to do Masters)  - or *prove* you can achieve a Masters level by doing the 3 Modules (i.e. achieving a Postgraduate Certificate).\n\nDoes that make sense? It cuts slack as in your background and history don't prove capability so past achievements don't define your current capabilities, but it doesn't cut slack as in the level expected for you to be able to do their MBA. You can't be matriculated unless you pass 3, or have the undergrad. So you aren't an MBA student until you have a postgraduate qualification or an undergraduate qualification of a certain level (and a postgraduate certificate is a more advanced level than the undergraduate, no matter the level of undergraduate) so you at that point are (in terms of qualifications) more qualified than someone who applied with just the undergraduate. You can't matriculate, i.e. you are not an MBA student *until* you have demonstrated this.  It's inclusive/open in terms of where you've come from, not open in terms of the level you have to be capable of.\n\nI totally understand your concerns though, if it's open to everyone, is it lower quality? No - it's open to everyone - but only high quality are going to pass or complete the full MBA - same as all other MBAs - the framework for what makes it Masters level is consistent across the UK - they wouldn't be able to call it a Masters if it was of lower quality or legitimacy to any other Masters.\n\nAlso, if its open to everyone and easy to subscribe to is it legitimate? Yes, the full MBA matriculation itself isn't open to everyone, nor does it cut slack in quality of candidates - just provides more options for demonstrating quality/ability. Anyone can attempt and pay for the modules though, and that's just a sensible business decision I guess. They generate more revenue, than requiring people to have qualifications before they start and at the same time increase the numbers of people receiving qualifications from them. They can also generate more revenue as people might only want to do one module. And also people attempting to meet the requirements to do the full MBA but failing won't count as part of their statistics for the MBA pass/fail rate, as they won't be matriculated MBA students at that point.\n\nSo in summary, I think it's a really understandable question - but I don't think it affects quality or legitimacy. If you didn't have to demonstrate a certain level ability and knowledge, skill etc to pass, or if the content wasn't masters level. Then maybe, but it just allows more people to do the course, less barriers to get on to the course (same requirements to pass as all other masters), and more revenue for them.\n\nHope that helps with your concerns!\n\n**Can you please tell me what happens after I complete the online order form for courses? I am thinking maybe I should try 1 course first?**\n\nThey process it all and then you get access to the online system and your course material is all on there. You can access the general MBA forum, and the module forum where you can ask questions to the lecturers or start/engage in discussions with other students. The first course you do should definitely be 'People, Work and Organisations' as everything you learn in that module can be applied to the other modules. You choose when to do the exams, they are take at home at the moment (until August 2021 then they will review and see), but they used to be in person. Maybe best buy 1 and look through the material and see what you think before buying anymore. I think the contents really great and the forums are great for asking questions to the lecturers etc. It's a mix of videos, textbooks, online text that they've written, additional reading and examples, and lots of questions like multiple choice, as well as essay style questions and questions that are discussions for students and lecturers on the forum to debate etc. I've really enjoyed all the courses I've done so far. I think you can ask to demo and have a look at an example before purchasing too, and they can send you the syllabus for the modules as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**After the form, would someone reach out to me?**\n\nYeah, they will email you the various registration details and let you know if they need more information. If you have the qualifications to matriculate and want to do that straight away then they'll ask for whatever paperwork they need if they need it (e.g. proof of qualifications), or if you want to matriculate after passing the 3 modules you let them know. If you matriculate they will send you your student card. Then you can email the student support services whenever you need, or ask them on the online forum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Would I need to provide them any documents? Such as?**\n\nI did the matriculate after passing 3 modules option so I'm not sure, when I matriculated I had to fill out a student enrolment form, send scan of passport, send a photo etc. If you aren't doing that I imagine they'll ask for your undergraduate certificate scan or similar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How is the Heriot Watt online courses' reputation? Like do you think/believe it will mean or provide much after obtaining the degree? How do the industry or employer consider the school and its qualification?**\n\nDepends on what you're after, you can look at the world university rankings and things, but the way they rank them is pretty old school. I think you're better off looking at student satisfaction. It's obviously not one of the 'top ten' ranked universities like Oxford, Cambridge, etc. and there are certain employers who value that so it just depends if those are the kind of places you want to work. So unless your other option is one of the top 10 global ranked, then from experience in workplace/industry I think they are all just viewed as identical to all other MBAs. The level is the same (Masters), what your expected to know is the same.\n\nMy experience, is that industries and employers in reality don't really care about what university you went to - in 10 years working I've never been asked in job applications or interviews, I've never even been asked what level I got. n my experience where you went to university doesn't really matter as much as it did 20/30 years ago\n\nAlso, there is a huge push on organisations and industry to increase diversity in their workplace so I'm job hunting at the moment and recently I've seen a lot of applications where they don't actually allow you to state the name of the university you went to (e.g. this is the case for most UK government roles) as that introduces bias to the review process. They are just interested in what you studied, to what level, what skills you have and your ability to evidence your knowledge and skills. So I think for any decent industry/organisation having an MBA qualification will be of huge value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that helps!

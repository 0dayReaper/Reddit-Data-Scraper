    "postText": "I was thrilled to recieve an offer to study for a Postgrad Diploma in Brewing and Distilling by Distance Learning! Now I really need to consider my options- I'm looking for any insight you might have.\n\nI don't have a degree, I've been working in the brewing and distilling industry for a few years now, and have completed my general certificates in Brewing and Distilling with the IBD with good results. My plan was to continue and do my Diploma in Distilling with the IBD and I have been studying the learning materials. I thought I'd apply for this course, not expecting a positive outcome, but was very glad to have been accepted.\n\nMy thoughts on doing the PgDip vs the IBD Diploma are that I should be left with a more thorough understanding, I will have more access to resources and teaching, that it will be more recognised, and that I might have the option to continue into doing my Masters.\n\nMy main concern is workload. I work full time currently and that remains a priority. I'm going to be studying part time and spreading this out over 3-4 years, so completing 2-3 courses per year. I've been informed that I should take my Intro to Process Technology and Brewing Microbiology and Biochemistry first and those both take place in the first semester.\n\nI'd be interested to learn more about what will be available to me, and what form studying and examinations take. I notice that both of these first courses, along with most of the others, have coursework and an examination. What form are these likely to take? My other major concern is that, not coming from an academic background, I will struggle to understand what is expected and lack institutional knowledge that may be taken for granted. \n\nI'd be very interested to hear what you think, but overall I am thrilled at the opportunity to study, learn, contribute, and achieve recognition despite my academic background.",

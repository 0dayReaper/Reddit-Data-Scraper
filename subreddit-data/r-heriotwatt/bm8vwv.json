I\u2019m an overseas student who\u2019s just received an offer for a MSc program beginning this September, and I\u2019m not sure how to go about finding accommodation. It\u2019s not too late to find a flat, it it? What are the best websites to search apartments, and where do I find a flatmate? And what\u2019s the best neighborhood to live in? Thanks in advance.",

Otherwise I would say you're definitely not too late to get a flat (Me and my flatmates don't have one yet). Good sites too look on are Rightmove and Zoopla for private flats or there's also a range of private student halls available in the city. A popular one for Heriot-watt students is Mill House. You can find a Facebook group run by the student union [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/flatmateHW/) to find flatmates if youd prefer a private flat. Hope that's helped \ud83d\ude0a",

I\u2019m trying to find a flat because I\u2019m kind of over the whole dormitory thing. Do you think it\u2019s absolutely necessary to see the property before I move in, as HW\u2019s website says, or can I just (sub)lease sight unseen?",

    "postText": " \n\n1. Do the rooms have an  ethernet port or a data port in them? The wifi on my laptop is a bit  inconsistent and unreliable, so I'd prefer to have an ethernet port  available to me when I'm in my room. If you can detail which room type  specifically has this (if any), I would really appreciate it.  \n\n2. Do all the offered rooms have a private washroom? If no, which rooms do?  \n\n3. How  far away are the offered dorms to the lecture hall(s)? Will it be  necessary to organize transportation or are most of the campus and  facilities within walking distance?\n4. Is  there a meal hall building or similar, in-which an annual payment is  made for access to the meal hall that contains provided meals?",

Most halls have private bathrooms expect the cheapest ones which are shared. \nPrivate bathroom halls:\nGeorge Burnett, Lord Holme, Robert Bryson, Lord Thompson, Christina Miller, Mary Furgeson, Robin Smith, Muriel Spark, Anne Macleod. \n\nThere\u2019s multiple food places. All in the main building with variety of foods and a shop. As well as a Starbucks and the student union serves food and alcohol on the opposite side of the campus.\n\nOverall everything you could need is there.",

As far as I'm aware all accommodation on the Edinburgh Campus has ethernet ports.\n\n2. 3 of the 4 accommodation types have private en-suite bathrooms, the only accommodation that doesn't is \nthe Traditional non en-suite rooms at \u00a3119 per week.\n\n3. All accommodation is on campus with a max walking time of roughly 10 mins to all lecture halls and other facilities.\n\n4. There are catering facilities but these act as normal cafes/restaurants, there is no pre-paid annual catering plan available.\n\nHope this answers all your questions :)",

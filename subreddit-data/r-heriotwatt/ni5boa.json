            "comment": "I started out my Construction Project Management MSc at the Dubai Campus as part-time. I\u2019d initially thought about doing to FT. Thankfully, I did not go the FT route. Working FT and attending Masters-level courses is very time consuming. I also, switched from on-campus to online or what HWU used to call Independent Distance Learning (IDL). \n\nI\u2019d made the switch because I started traveling for work and attending classes was very challenging if not impossible at times. I will say that the pandemic made sitting for exams much easier. I no longer had to go to the Dubai campus to sit for exams. \n\nI will say that I am a little disappointed that I was not able to enjoy the new Dubai campus. It looks very nice!",

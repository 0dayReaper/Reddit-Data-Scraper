    "postText": "I\u2019m a student[M] at a university in knowledge park and I am looking to live nearby so I can commute to and fro quickly. The student accommodations in DIAC are too far for commuting which is non ideal. I heard that Mercure hotel in Barsha heights had a student package but they upped its price by a lot until April. So I\u2019m looking for any student shared apartments or something like that. Or of there are other interested students as well then I know of some existing rooms which we can share.",

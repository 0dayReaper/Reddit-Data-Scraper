    "postText": "Hey guys,\nMy sister has got admission to the borders campus in textile.\nShe's looking for accommodations.\nIs the university housing too expensive? Is it cheaper to rent somewhere in the city? How easy or difficult can it be to find a room/apartment to rent considering she's still not moved to Scotland? \nWhat is the best option, renting in the city or the university accommodation for the first year? \nAlso it's her first time abroad and doesn't really have that much experience with such things",

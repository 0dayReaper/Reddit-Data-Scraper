    "postText": "1. What day are courses to be selected and how exactly does it work? If there's a page on the website that explains that you can just link me there I just can't seem to find a concrete answer online.\n\n2. What's the easiest way to get a bus to the Marilyn I Walker campus / the main campus from Niagara Falls?\n\n3. What's the best way to build your timetable? Is it better to have your classes spread out over each day or have them all consolidated and then have 2-3 days empty?\n\nThanks so much in advance for any help! I'm excited to start in September but feel woefully unprepared haha.",

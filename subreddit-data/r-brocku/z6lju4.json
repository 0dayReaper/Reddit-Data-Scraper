These will be included in your top 6 average calculation even if they aren\u2019t one of your highest six marks. \n\nSo, as kingofstorms pointed out, a BA will generally look at English and your 5 best U/M course grades. A BSc, depending on the program, will require English + one or more of bio, chemistry, physics, etc.",

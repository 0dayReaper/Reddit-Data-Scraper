I have taken that course as well as 2P93. 2P93 was fully async and was only: a forum post, an assignment on a movie, a poster, and a fake hole exam. I didn\u2019t read or watch a single lecture until doing the take home exam and I did well all semester. would definitely recommend",

Seminar participation, weekly reading questions which the prof wanted students to write down 1 question we had about material from the week, a take home midterm, which was 10 questions that were easy and didnt expect a lot of writing, you could get by with just glancing at the textbook. A short essay,  which was only 4 pages. The last assignment was a media analysis where he just wanted us to collect 5 news reports pertaining to a sport event of our choice and answer the questions he  outlined.\n\nAlso, have no idea about labr 1p95, but its a labour course labour courses are easy.",

Assignments were easy, but it was definitely my lowest grade of the semester. I finished with a 78%, which is fair considering the lack of work I put in. It\u2019s easy enough, but the TA is definitely a harder marker than I was expecting.",

First is an intro post about your families work history, second is answering questions about a film from the 1950s, third is a poster or podcast + annotated bibliography on a major event or organization in labour history, and last is the final exam which is a take home. It wasn\u2019t too bad!",

    "postText": "Hello, I was curious on what the core differences are of the two programs in my header. I have a passion in computer science but didn't apply to Brock fast enough to get into the normal CS coop so I am wondering how different the CS and mathematics course is! Other then the obvious that theres more math involved, what are the differences and is there any possibility to transfer?",

            "comment": "Take a co-op. For most people the reason for acquiring a degree is to get hired, co-ops project hireability to prospective employers. The programs should be pretty synonymous between the first year or two even. Take all of MATH 1P05, 1P06, 1P66, 1P67, 1P12 and you should be covered for your first year or two on both programs",

Courses look completely different depending on which professor you get, so make sure you get the good ones. Use ratemyprof",

    "postText": "Does your GPA carry over to BrockU from your previous institution or does your GPA start fresh when you transfer? I'm planning to transfer for Fall 2023 and had transfer credits awarded, but wonder if my GPA starts fresh at Brock because I have some low grades from my previous institution.",

Transfer is one column, then Brock credits are the other columns.",

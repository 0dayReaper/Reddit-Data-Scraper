I take both of these classes. \n\nFor HLSC 1F90 you need a new copy of the book because you need one with the one time access code to be able to do the online weekly quizzes that count towards your grade. \n\nFor BIOL 1F25, the textbook is not mandatory and is in reality completely useless. I bought it in the beginning of last semester and never opened it once.",

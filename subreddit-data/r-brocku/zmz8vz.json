    "postText": "I only need one more chem or biochem credit to qualify for an additional qualification for teachers college to teach chem. But I\u2019m really hoping to find a chem credit that isn\u2019t going to kick my ass because I\u2019ve heard second year and up sucks for chem at brock. I\u2019d ideally like for it to be in the summer or online too\u2026. But I know the pickings will be slim. If anyone knows of any courses that run like this I\u2019d love to hear it. I know the timetable for spring isn\u2019t out yet.",

There\u2019s also tons and tons of orgo resources. But there\u2019s first year that runs in the spring too. That\u2019s it. Third year pseudo thesis courses run in the summer, you need to be in 3rd year Chem to get that.",

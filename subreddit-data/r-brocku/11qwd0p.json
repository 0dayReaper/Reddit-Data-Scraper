            "comment": "Typically your alternative offer will state what reason you weren\u2019t accept to your original, or if it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re possibly on a waitlist. What were you originally apply to and what was your average while applying? You also have the opportunity to change your major once you\u2019ve started if you meet the requirements. \n\nAs for Rec and Leisure, the pay and job opportunities depend what area you specialize in and what you would enjoy doing. Outdoor Rec tends to be extremely popular so job opportunities may be more competitive. Therapeutic and Community recreation would have more  job opportunities overall as they tend to be more year-round whereas outdoor can be more \u201cseasonal\u201d at times.",

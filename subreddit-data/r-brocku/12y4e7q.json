    "postText": "So I had 10 unpaid parking tickets on my car from last year but because they did not know it was my car (it was never registered so as far as they know they just have the car and plate) they couldn\u2019t charge me. I graduated this fall and I am now going back to Brock for a second degree and on my Brock account it shows unpaid fines. I paid them, and it is not a big deal to me but I am wondering how they were able to connect me to my plate.\n\nAs far as I know only the MTO/city/police could run plates. Also why wouldn\u2019t they have done this last year and held my graduation instead of waiting until I was already graduated? Anyone else experience this?",

    "postText": "So I will soon begin the process of applying for residence at Brock and I have been doing my own research looking at pictures and doing virtual tours of the rooms. Despite that I feel I can't make a decision with what I have so far. I was wondering if any Brock students could let me know which dorm is the \"best\"\n\nfor me the best would entail the largest amount of room, and privacy as i'm quite a private person (so not the village)  \nof course all the other things like cleanliness and convenience are also involved in my decision",

Newest and nicest, undisputable as a first choice, assuming cost is not your priority.\n\nYou may have to share a bathroom with the room next to you but that's better than sharing with the whole floor, and they're finishing a cafeteria in the first floor of the building. Also, laundry machines are on floor 1.",

            "comment": "I'm going to turn this into a \"guide\" in case others have the same or similar question.\n\nImportant to note, at Brock, unless your average is 90+ you can only sort by residence style and not by exact building.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe two best residences for single rooms are Earp and Res 8. In both these residences you will share a bathroom with one other person. The rooms are decently spacious (biggest single rooms by far) and bright with big windows. If you are looking for a single room I highly suggest one of these 2 residence buildings. There is laundry in each building and the only downside would be that you'd need to walk about 1-3 mins outside to get food so if this is a deal breaker for you then I'd suggest Valle. Res 8 also has a service desk which is great for picking up packages.\n\nValle is another residence that is made up entirely of single rooms however it is not as new or bright as Earp or Res 8. Like the other two, you will share a bathroom with only one other person, laundry is in the building and you also have the ability to walk to the dining hall without ever going outside through a hall that connects it to Decew.\n\nDecew is an interesting residence but I also believe it is underrated. This residence is made up of singles and doubles and has communal washrooms. One thing I will note about the washrooms is that I've spoken to many people who live there and they have all told me it has never been an issue. This building also has no elevator so if that's a problem you will want to pick something else. I do not recommend the double rooms in Decew if you are hoping for one as they are smaller than the double rooms in Lowenberger. The single rooms however are decently sized like Earp, Valle and Res 8. Another pro is that the dining hall is in your building and would be a less than 10 second walk to the main university buildings. You will also get a more community feel and will get to know everyone around you better. There is again, laundry in your building. This residence also has a service desk which is great for picking up packages.\n\nFor someone interested in a double room I would strongly suggest Lowenberger. The double rooms are extremely spacious and you will share a bathroom between 3 people. I will note however, I do not recommend the single rooms in Lowe. They are tiny and very cramped. Another pro is that there is a dining hall and laundry mat in the building so you can go to both without ever stepping outside. The service desk is also in the building which makes it extremely convenient for picking up packages or whatever.\n\nIf you want a kitchen you have two residence options. Quarry and Village. I would recommend Quarry over village because the houses are a lot nicer and the rooms are more spacious than Village. The downside of Quarry is that it is about a 5-10 minute walk to the main university campus. Village rooms are a lot smaller and less new as well however Village is a 1-2 min walk from Lowenberger which has the laundry and dining hall. A downside of Village is that it's the party residence and will often be very loud at night. If you are into parties but want to be able to get away from them and sleep then Lowenberger would be a good option. Word of advice. Absolutely never go for a Village double. They are the worst rooms available and you could be unlucky enough to end up in a bunk bed with this option.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know!",

I'm sure it will continue to help many future students! For my situation I do have a 90+ average so I am able to have a bit more of a role in my room decision. From what I've read here res 8 and earp seem to be my best options, given my criteria. Out of the two would you recommend res 8 or earp? Looking at the other responses res 8 seems to be the best inside and out!",

It's small but cozy. large window. twin bed (i recommend a mattress topper to make it more comfortable), enough room for a fridge. Bring a cushion for the chair or bring your own chair. Village area is party city, so stay away from there. On the residence application, you will be asked to rank your residence by room type. They will assign you the building, so not much choice there. I read that Room types are assigned based on your marks. My daughter is happy with her choice of room and Earp. good luck",

I was wondering if anyone could share things they like about brock, or just share something that could help me decide?\n\nthanks!",

If your average is 93-100% you will get a $16,000 for four years ($4000 for 4 years). I\u2019m in CHYS 1F90 right now for Honours Forensic Psychology and Criminal Justice and it\u2019s a very interesting class. We have weekly seminar reading responses to do which aren\u2019t too bad. They can be tricky but not too bad. The exams for this class are open book, and the professors are pretty laid back. Prof John especially. In short, you\u2019ll learn a lot. Feel free to message me and I can try and answer any of your questions. I\u2019m a first year student \ud83e\udd17",

The profs and people are great, but they run the school like a business. Them first, you last. I saw they just rolled in a bunch of roombas when I walked in one morning. Glad to see my scholarship money went to good use! Big national and provincial awards Brock is known to be scummy with. Half the time students (graduate level) make less when they win the awards than without. Some decline the awards just so they get the money but can write on their CV that they did.",

I think you\u2019d get the same education wherever you go, but you might have better classmates at schools with higher acceptance standards.",

Also if you care about having a fun social life in terms of partying, etc. then Brock isnt the place to be\u2026 If you want good education in addition to a fun uni social life then I suggest going elsewhere but if you only care about the education the Brock is absolutely a solid school to go to.",

I don't know too much about your situation, but either one is a really good choice. \n\nHave you visited both campuses? Maybe do that and see how it feels walking around. Or maybe compare the CHYS program with the Psych program at UW. There are probably a few differences. \n\nAt the end of the day, you have to live in a place for years. I find that following your gut is usually the best thing to do, especially when both are good choices. Comfort and happiness are key. Plus, you can search out things at either school if needed (e.g., restaurants, clubs, hangout spots).\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "I've overwhelmingly heard that Brock is what you make of it, and I think it's completely true. You can experience completely different things if you get involved around you or focus on a few things.\n\nYou will very soon get used to the layout of the entire campus. The halls are not insanely busy most of the time. The best way I can describe the campus is static and homey - little, if anything, changes. It can get dull.\n\nThere are numerous extracurricular clubs you can involve yourself in and events of all kinds. I have also found that seminars for courses are very good avenues for meeting people and forming relationships. I can tell you from personal experience that it is exceptionally easy to build rapport with teachers, instructors, and the like. There are many mental health resources as well.\n\nAs for the city of St. Catharines and the Niagara region, it is insanely boring for long-term residents but could offer some entertainment for newcomers. Your mobility with public transit is subpar; buses to most parts of the city come every 30 minutes during the day and begin to arrive every hour after 6PM. The service COMPLETELY stops around 5PM on weekends, so beware of that.\n\nThe coursework is honestly not difficult if you are consistent. There are so many silent areas to study and loud ones with groups if that is for you. There's a gym, pool, and running track to use if you were so inclined. The school might not do many things well, but it has a lot of things available. In the end, what you get is up to you.",

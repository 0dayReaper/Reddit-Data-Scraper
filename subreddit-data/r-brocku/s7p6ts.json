    "postText": "if you dont wanna listen to my complaining happily scroll along. so i understand that online school is not a reasonable thing to go on forever. we obviously need to return to in person learning at some point. but is now really the right time? we're literally in the middle of the pandemic still and the gov has the province in literal lockdown... we cant dine at a restaurant rn but brock is promising us that we're gonna be back on jan 31. im sorry what? i know many people are in this boat, but I legit only have to be in person for the lectures for one class. everything else is basically online or at least hybrid. i live over 3 hours from brock. im stuck in this dilemma now as to if I should commute to my class once a week, or just move back to st catharines and be lonely and depressed there for one class when I essentially could just finish online. idk about you guys, but last sem was a disaster for me. i felt like there weren't enough in person supports at school. i could only see a counsellor maybe once a month. i could never get a stupid \"slot\" at the gym. there was basically nothing to keep me grounded. on top of this, I have emailed department heads, deans, the provost, presidents office, BUSU, central, and all my profs. only 2 of my profs have replied. central said they'll pass my message along, and one of the deans said they'll pass my message along. I've gotten no response otherwise. i feel like my voice has gone completely unheard. BUSU's poll showed just over half of students preferred to stay online (or just have an option at least), yet brock is pushing everyone back in person regardless. what about the other 50% of the population? im so confused right now. this is the most unorganized situation ever. brocks plan is basically for everyone to just get sick. okay great. i mean I understand you cant hide from the flu/cold forever, but come on. we're told not to come to campus if we're sick. okay literally everyone is going to sick since omicron is so contagious, including profs. well woop de doo if the prof gets sick they cant come teach. if all the students get sick they cant come to class, or they come anyways and make more people sick. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWTF IS GOING ON BROOOOO rant over.",

Once they go back in person, it takes nothing to set up a camera to record and post, having those who want to go present and those who don\u2019t still attending online at the same time as everyone else.",

            "comment": "Just because this strain of COVID isn't very severe, it doesn't mean we should all be forced back to school where we will inevitably catch it and just hope none of us have serious symptoms. \n\nI also completely agree and understand that we need to go back eventually, but these are the highest the case numbers have ever been, it is basically guaranteed that most of the student body will catch it unless some miracle happens on January 31st that makes us all immune. \n\nAnd what happens when a large portion of the student body catches it? Send us all back online? We need consistency in our learning and I am terrified that if we go back in person we will end up online again at some point which will make this semester a nightmare. \n\nAlso what is this phased reopening even benefitting? Many students take courses across various years/levels, so like me, half my classes go back on the 31st and then a other half on February 7th, so what's the point? What is a week difference really going to make except making life even more confusing than it already is?",

And don\u2019t just post on reddit, email everyone and get your friends to as well. Threaten to drop. Even contact your local MPP office since they are obligated to help you and the province funds the schools.",

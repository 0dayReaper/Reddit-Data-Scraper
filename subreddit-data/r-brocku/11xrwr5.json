    "postText": "I hope someone can help me please. If a student is registered for 0.5 credits for Spring D2 and 0.5 credits for Summer D1 is that student considered a full time student or a part time student? I\u2019m having some trouble understanding how it works. I looked at the chart on the Brock site but I don\u2019t know if the D2 for spring is significant. Any help or insight would be much appreciated!",

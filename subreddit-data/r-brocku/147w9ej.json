If you're coming in with any transfer credits, I\u2019d recommend taking a full courseload each semester until you get to your final year. \n\nOthers have mentioned doing school during the spring/summer. Offerings in KINE during this time is mixed, as it\u2019s really based on sabbaticals/ who\u2019s available, although spring tends to offer more than summer. Spring offers a bit of variety between mandatory and elective courses but summer is usually a couple first year courses and a random 3-4th year elective. Although the option is there, I wouldn\u2019t bank on it equating to much, as it may only end up being a 1.5-2.5 credits worth of courses over your full time at Brock",

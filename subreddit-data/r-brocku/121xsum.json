If interested, there is also a focus group you can apply for at the end of survey that will offer gift card compensation. \n\nThe following is an anonymous link to anyone who has the time, with the option to sign up for the focus group upon completion. Feel free to share the link to people you know that attend Brock. \n\n[https://brock.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_3CPfGPszdgDwknQ](https://brock.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3CPfGPszdgDwknQ?fbclid=IwAR2Oau6gi1pRrW56THT-GNQZfKrsimfSlAp8uNYf_T4wF0tny4tmrmRO_lY)\n\nThank you!",

    "postText": "I am an incoming MPAcc student at Brock University within 2 months. To prepare well before going to Brock University, I want to self-study some courses in advance at my home. Then who I should contact to have course material such as slides or textbook, and others. \nAnd about admission requirements of Coop program, is it hard to achieve 75% average? I used to study CFA program, so when compared to CFA course, which is harder?\nAnd could you all suggest any MPAcc student forum or community?\nThank you all in advance!",

Profs usually make course material available as it becomes relevant, like if you have a project due at the end of the semester, you might get a vague idea of what it is at the start, but you probably won\u2019t get rubrics, exact requirements, templates, etc until after the midterm for example. Depends on the prof and the course but I don\u2019t imagine you being able to get course material now",

Most of the time it will be digital and if you want a hard copy you will have to print it yourself with the exception of textbooks, but even then some of them are ebooks. I find that most people use tablets or print slides to make notes on slides if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking to do :) if you need course material a different way (ex. Hard copy instead of digital) for a medical or disability reason, that\u2019s something you can take up with SAS (Student Accessibility Services), but if it\u2019s just preference they may not be able to do much for you. I know one of my friends is still healing from a concussion so they get slides and that stuff as a hard copy from the prof because they can\u2019t look at screens long, but that is because of the concussion.",

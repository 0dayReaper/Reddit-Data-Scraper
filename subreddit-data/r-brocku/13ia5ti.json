            "comment": "I took kine 2P95 this past school year! Professor D. Mack was teaching the course. She's a great lecturer and a really nice prof. However, she supplements her lectures by relying HEAVILY on the associated textbook by using required readings and chapter quizzes. \n\nThe class was structured with: 6 small assignments (20%), weekly quizzes (20%), and 2 term quizzes (30% each). The assignments and weekly quizzes were easy and the bigger quizzes were more challenging because it was a lot of questions/scenarios in a short amount of time. \n\nPersonally, I didn't enjoy this course. Mainly because I don't like psychology (idek why I took 2p95). However, there are some topics that you may find interesting! How moods/emotion effect performance, coaching, stress, etc..\n\n2p95 isn't a difficult course - you just have to make sure psychology is something you're interested in learning about! And be sure to stay on top of the material. I forgot almost half of the weekly assignments and did really poorly on the first quiz and still managed to get a \"B\".",

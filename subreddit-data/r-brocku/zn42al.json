            "comment": "I think common consensus is that it was pretty fucked. \n\nWhen they said it was cumulative I assumed it would mean there would be easy questions from the start of the semester (like chapters 1-6). There was no resonance, the nomenclature was slightly more than what I was expecting, and the hydroboration was a little overcomplicated but it was doable. \n\nI also think there was way to much NMR for what it was worth. There was like 4 questions on NMR which was absolutely wild considering we only worked on it for like 4-6 lectures but I guess I should have expected it. \n\nI had an 80 going into the exam but last night I honestly thought I might have gotten below 30 on that lmao. I forgot what a fucking ester, aldehyde, and amide looked like so that definitely fucked me up a bit. After having a bit of time to think about it I'm sure I passed but I don't know if I passed with a good mark lmao.",

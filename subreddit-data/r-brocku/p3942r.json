Of those most involved a pre existing illness or disease. \nAnyone under 40 yrs old has 0% chance of death if we are healthy. and are the least likely to have any Covid related complications. All Covid related death or complications involved a pre existing health problem. \nThe same number of elderly who passed since the first wave of 2020 are very similar death numbers for the flu season of 2016 and 2018..\nIn other words vaccines are unnecessary and have unknown side effect data. Common sense says wait and stay away from crowds and being around people.. has Brock updated ventilation? No has Brock done anything besides mandate a vaccine that has failed to stop the spread or contraction yes. It\u2019s all about money and power and people should be able\nTo chose not to get an experimental vaccine and Brock should not be allowed to fanfare anything related to unknown substances entering anyone\u2019s body I find your comment very simple minded and uninformed of the data.. read a medical journal. Read stats Canada website we now know a lot of things we didn\u2019t last year.

What level of safety is acceptable to you for a return to campus, what hoops if any would you propose for people to jump through if any? There is this debate about mandate or no mandate, but those arguing against a mandate are not providing an alternative solution.\n\nAs well, in terms of limiting principles, is that necessary when there is an opt-out? Or do you consider Covid testing an infringement on human rights as well (I'm being literal not sarcastic)? I just want to see if I can better understand your view point. I think you have a fine understanding of where the pro-mandate crowd is coming from. If we understand eachother better then discussion will be more productive hopefully. I don't feel I understand you.\n\nThat said here's my answers to each of your questions in order, I don't want to leave you hanging and be asking more from you haha,\n-Limiting principle: none, there is an opt-out, thus principle not needed? not my area of expertise\n-'safe' campus: just curious what acceptably safe looks like to you, I do not know what it looks like to you. to me it would be 100% vaccinated so that anyone that gets Covid is far less affected by it.\n\nMuch appreciated!",

The burden of proof is on those arguing *in favour* of vaccine mandates to show that mandates supersede fundamental rights in this instance. A compelling limiting principle must be articulated. Without this, bodily autonomy means nothing, and the principle of medical non-discrimination is moot. \n\nIt clearly doesn't disturb the pro-mandate side that Brock's administration has not thought seriously about these implications before forcing medical procedures on students.\n\nWhat is a 'safe' campus in your esteem? You have already conceded that it is [questionable whether the vaccinated reduce the spread of Covid-19](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/08/06/fully-vaccinated-may-transmit-delta-just-as-easily-and-new-variant-shows-signs-of-vaccine-evasion-early-uk-research-suggests/?sh=321df6a41ac5), so why mandate vaccination? Of course, this is ancillary to the question of a limiting principle: science cannot arbitrarily destroy fundamental rights. \n\nThere is no 'opt out' of this mandate. There are *certain exemptions* *that can be* *filed* under the Ontario Human Rights Code, and even then the unvaccinated must be subjected to frequent and potentially intrusive testing. That is very different.",

I agree that there should be no mandate, but strong encouragement to be vaccinated, and I agree that Brock has made a mistake in allowing a mandate. If you were solely in charge, what would you have done to ensure majority satisfaction? Is it possible to have Brock change things to be a little less aggressive, this late in the game? I\u2019m thinking of those who have reasons for not getting the vaccine - like I said, I get it from both sides and do not appreciate the iron fist over my education. If there is no way to change it now, why is Brock not accommodating those who are concerned about their post-vaccine health, for example, or those who have another medical reason for remaining unvaccinated? I firmly believe there should be more distance education options. Brock will still make their money by having distance students as opposed to denying students education because of their refusal to comply. Winter term has almost nothing online which is a huge problem IMO.",

However, anyone who's paying attention should be concerned about moving goal posts. Ontario started with \"Two Weeks to Flatten the Curve,\" and now we are in an indefinite lockdown with vaccine mandates. The reopening targets keep shifting, even though other provinces have fully reopened.   \n\n\nAll of this might be justified. Ontario might be a uniquely problematic province. I don't know. However, the idea that we should blindly trust public health authorities with control over our fundamental rights is dangerous. Anyone in a position of power needs to be accountable to their constituents, even during ostensible emergencies.   \n\n\nA simple intervention would be to publicly broadcast the Ontario COVID-19 Science Table meetings, and to have special criminal sanctions for politicians and public health authorities who violate Covid-19 restrictions. [The details of Covid-19 vaccine contracts](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2021/05/25/canadas-secret-covid-19-vaccine-contracts-hinder-the-fight-to-boost-vaccine-confidence-researchers-say.html) should also be made public. These measures invoke Skin in the Game, would make decision-makers more accountable, and would reduce distrust.   \n\n\nI know this doesn't answer your question of what Brock should do specifically, but if leadership from the top is more accountable, then I believe that the leadership at institutions like Brock would follow a good path.",

I\u2019m glad you mentioned the moving goal posts - I\u2019m amazed at how few are concerned or even make note of it happening. I understand new diseases are unpredictable, so that can certainly move some posts. But to see other provinces head toward normalcy while we seemingly are heading in the opposite direction is quite unnerving. It seems a little off that a single province can worsen considerably while others, especially surrounding, are only improving. Should neighbouring provinces not eventually worsen alongside us? But we\u2019ve seen none of that, so what else is going on? \n\nI\u2019m not dismissing the reality of Covid. It\u2019s real, it\u2019s here, and it can be awful. But there are some pieces of this puzzle that aren\u2019t making complete sense. \n\nPoliticians ignoring guidelines is another gripe of mine, but that\u2019s politics for you.",

Your right to not take a vaccine against a virus that has lead to a global pandemic does not supersede the right of someone else to not die of the virus. \nIt's okay to be antivax.

Don't let this person who thinks there is a HEP C vaccine available sway you with some red herring argument. \n\nAll this people are going to be in shock when we lockdown again with higher numbers this year than last even with 79% of the allowed population being vaccinated. They're going to be really shocked when they realise these vaccines are ineffective for the spread and also become even more useless overtime because this virus mutates faster than we can keep up with the medicine.

If the university is able to stay open for in person despite unvaccinated Canadians/Ontarians keeping the spread of COVID up, and those who choose to not get the jab can still attend class via that protocol, yall have *nothing* to complain about, imo.",

The pandemic isn't ending itself however, we have to do it ourselves and the only thing that's doing that is the vaccine. Incredibly less risky than getting Covid, and it's not like smoking or drinking that can have long term effects because you're continuously consuming them, it's a two-dose thing and that's it.\n\nThat said I don't think people get convinced one way or the other, they're either already okay with it and just needed a tiny bit more info, or where never going to get it. Reasoning is more often used to backup a decision, not arrive at one.",

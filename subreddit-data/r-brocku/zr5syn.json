    "postText": "I recently got a 0% on my final assignment because I went over the 1 page max for the assignment. The reasoning I went over was because I was put citations for my research. It was not said that it was required, but I felt the need to put it just in case because most work requires citation. I am currently disputing this but it will be a while until I get a response. Is this allowed because even though I went over the limit I find very unjust to give me a zero because I put citations.",

If you are referring to a references list then this probably shouldn\u2019t count, as it typically isn\u2019t counted for page or word limits. You can try to dispute it, but it might come down to how nice your prof is. And if your prof said they aren\u2019t responding to emails before the 9th then you probably have to wait until then.",

That being said, the best bet is to wait until your prof is back, schedule a meeting and to over how and why. I can't think of a single prof who would do something like this vindictively and without reason.",

From what I remember there\u2019s a few steps, first talk to the prof and if you don\u2019t agree with their decision, you can keep escalating it- hopefully it doesn\u2019t get that far. I think the appeal has to be submitted with 90 day. You have options, just look into it and make sure you have everything needed to help your case.",

You might be able to talk to ombuds but idk if they will reply before the 9th.\n\nIn-text citations unfortunately do count towards your page limit if they were required (I would double check with your prof if they weren\u2019t required).

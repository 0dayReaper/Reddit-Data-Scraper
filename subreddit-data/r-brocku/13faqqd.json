    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm a grade 12 student and have applied for concurrent education in history and geography. I have an 89 average and have only been admitted to an alternate program. Is it too late to still be accepted into ConnEd? Is there a way of knowing if I've been rejected? Are all the spots filled? I'm really stressed out that I won't get in :( Thanks for any help in advance.",

            "comment": "From what I recall- near the cut off date for acceptances, if they dont have enough people for the program, they will send out additional offers to those that got alternate offers to try and meet their quota. \n\nIts not garunteed that will happen though, and things might have changed since I applied for uni.\n\nI wish you the best of luck though!",

            "comment": "My experience is exactly the same as yours lol. Applied for Con-Ed for English as well as just English as my second choice. I got my acceptance for English months ago and accepted it, as I ended up not being in love with the idea of Con-Ed anymore and was happy with just doing English and going to teacher college afterwards. However, a few days ago Brock emailed me saying they revised my offer; they VOIDED my acceptance into English to offer me Con-Ed, which was not at all what I wanted lol, so I had to email them and get my previous acceptance reinstated. \n\nSo TLDR, they will email you about revising your current offer, and you\u2019ve still got time. I just got that revised offer on May 8th and you need to accept by June 1st, so you\u2019ve got time still. Hopefully me turning down Con-Ed bumps you up on that list, and good luck!",

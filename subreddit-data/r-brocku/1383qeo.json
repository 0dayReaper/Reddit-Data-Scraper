But usually you may have to take a few courses in the spring to keep on track to finish at the same time since you have to complete all required courses of your new program/major. For your old major, some of the previously taken courses are used as electives, and some not be usable. Depends on the program u were in and what program you will switch into.",

            "comment": "depends on what level of con-ed you were (p/j, j/i, i/s), and whether you are wanting to declare your major in CHYS or WGST (sorry the posting is a little confusing). I did switch from j/i to p/j, and in p/j you technically declare a CHYS major. I agree with the above poster though, best course of action is to speak to an academic advisor",

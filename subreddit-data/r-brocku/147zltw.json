In this case, it\u2019ll be 0.5 credits.\n\nAs per how these courses work, you\u2019ll typically be assigned readings (papers, textbook, etc.) with the expectations that they are read before the class. There may be some opportunities to refresh on the baseline content/mechanics, although it\u2019s typically not as in-depth as you would\u2019ve recieved in an earlier year class, so it\u2019s really up to you to ensure you understand the material prior to the seminar. They tend to be listed as seminars as the class size tends to be much smaller, thus helping to promote more discussion/opportunity to be engaged in the material.",

Atleast at brock, medsci has a lot more freedom with electives and such in the first few years compared to biomed. I've also really enjoyed medsci at brock, but in reality it depends on your end goal, so take it as it is.",

Are there any specific questions about the program I can answer. Alternatively/additionally, have you visited both campuses for a tour or Open House?\n\nIt might very well be that you find more differences between these two options outside of the classroom, than inside.",

    "postText": "Hey y'all, just a heads up for anyone at Brock that may have crossed paths with me Tuesday, I woke up today with a sore throat and took a rapid test, shows positive. I was in the ITIS 2P91 exam in the WCIBDS gym 7-9pm last night (Tuesday) with a bunch of other exams. Sat in Row 30, seat 2.\n\nI also spent the day leading up to the exam on the 9th floor of the library at the north east corner. Didn't have symptoms to my knowledge at the time, was a tad cold but I figured that's just the HVAC settings.\n\nStrongly recommend doing a rapid test if you were nearby. I haven't been in groups outside of exams, I suspect I probably got exposed last Thursday during the ACTG 2P12 exam in STH 4, at 7-10pm, as I still mask in stores and whatnot. I've also notified Brock.",

    "postText": "Hi!  \nI'm considering going here for the Computer Science program.   \nJust have a couple of questions I would be grateful to be answered. \n\n1. How is the co-op? How difficult is it to get a job through it? Do most people find jobs on their own or are the job boards and services enough?\n2. How relevant are the courses taught? Will they be helpful in getting a job or are they more theoretical like most universities where you must learn specific things on your own. \n3. How would you rate your experience at the program?\n\nThanks a lot!",

Would I be eligible to have/get co-op in my third year? I\u2019m sorta confused because I have applied for co-op",

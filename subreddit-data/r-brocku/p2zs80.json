    "postText": "Okay. Can I just say busu\u2019s latest post on Instagram was just asking for trouble? Everyone is fighting and bad mouthing each other in the comments and it\u2019s just sad. Our school community is becoming divided and hateful against each other over vaccination status. Moreover, it would be great if Brock had a solid plan for this year. I live like 4 hours from the school so I had to sign another lease. But I have no clue if we\u2019ll be sent home again. I wish they would\u2019ve made an online option available so people could just pick that if they wanted to and not have to worry about rent or all this covid crap. I\u2019m just so sick and tired of the lack of communication and confusion. My anxiety is through the roof about school right now. Just thinking about how disorganized and confusing this all is makes me sick. Anyone else feeling frustrated??",

Now I'm scared of not being able to go to WORK or SCHOOL or a GYM. \n\nI thought that the school would provide an online format \ud83e\udd14  ...... this is the information age afterall; digital learning is the demand .... idk, I don't get it. \n\nWhat happened to promoting mental health \ud83d\ude15  what happened to isolation outrage. None of this is promoting personal wellbeing. \n\nIt's sad to see the university go down this road. No surprised, just sad. Maybe the profs will do their parts to make lectured and tests accessible to ALL as we are being taught to do.",

I only had 1 out of 4 have in-person components, but the prof made it optional to be online too. It isn\u2019t hard. I don\u2019t understand why this isn\u2019t a format.  \n\nBut anyway, I will wish you the best of luck this year since we\u2019re started! If you need an ear to listen, you can always DM me! Or Brock has some discord servers for various departments and classes you can join. Sometimes that helps!",

They don\u2019t even state how full the classes will be and I doubt they\u2019ll be at 100% capacity. It feels like they\u2019re treating it as if covid has been cured and everything is normal. I think we\u2019ll be shut down again because of the delta variant.",

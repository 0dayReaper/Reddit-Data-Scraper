    "postText": "Hello,\n\nNow that course planning and the timetables are out I'm starting to decide which times/dates I'll be selecting for my course selection in July. \n\nJust making a post to ask the community which professors they would reccomend and why. \n\nHere are the courses I'll be taking this fall, as well as the repsective professors available to choose from:\n\n**ACTG 2P31:** Glenn\u00a0Skrubbeltrang, Parunchana\u00a0Pacharn, or Samir\u00a0Trabelsi\n\n**ACTG 2P97:** Zhang\u00a0Xia - only one professor to choose from so how is this prof? (if you know)\n\n**ACTG 3P43:** Glenn\u00a0Skrubbeltrang, Michelle\u00a0Lau, or Tanya\u00a0Tang\n\n**ECON 2P91:** Taylor\u00a0Wright and a bunch of TBD professors \n\n**FNCE 2P91:** Geoffrey\u00a0Hoover, Mohamed\u00a0Ayadi, or Onem\u00a0Ozocak\n\nThis is my schedule for year two of the BAcc (Co-Op) program, if anyone has taken these courses and/or professors, let me know which ones you'd reccomend to take classes from. Just trying to make my semester more enjoyable and abovid having to learn from a bad prof and not enjoy a course as much as I could (or not do as well because of them). \n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Had Pacharn for ACTG2P31, she\u2019s a good prof. Lectures can be boring. Easy to get a high mark as she has assignments quizzes and in class exercises which can boost your mark going into the exam. \n\n Didn\u2019t have 2P97 with Celine xia. A lot of ppl don\u2019t like her. But personally she\u2019s not that bad. As long as you do the work and stay on top of things you will get a good mark.\n\nHaven\u2019t had any of the other profs so far",

Least favourite prof I've had by far, and Im in 4th year\n\nACTG 3P43- I'd avoid Tanya, shes not great but not as bad as others say. Michelle is pretty good I hear.\n\nECON 2P91- no idea who Wright is, but if you have Motjaba as an option, avoid him\n\nFNCE 2P91- Hoover was great, would definitely recommend.",

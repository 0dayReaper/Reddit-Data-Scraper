Check the spam folder. \nIf you have the credentials to log in already reach out to your academic advisor as well and always include to please be forwarded to the right contact partner if they know it.\n\nEdit: I think your start date was rather the 7th just like it was for everyone else. (With orientation on Monday/Tuesday). It seems like you\u2018re a little late with your stress there tbh class registration closes in 5 days.",

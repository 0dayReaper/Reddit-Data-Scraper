            "comment": "This is the official word from Brock so far:\n\n\n# TLDR OF ALL SCENARIOS:\n\n## Scenario A\n\nCourse delivery with a significant return to on-campus instruction, complemented with online and hybrid delivery elements as determined through the usual academic planning process\n\n## Scenario B\n\nCourse delivery with some return to on-campus instruction, with significant online and hybrid delivery elements\n\n## Scenario C\n\nCourse delivery almost entirely online, as has been the case for example during lockdown scenarios (i.e., March-April 2020 and January-February 2021).\n# Are we returning to Campus in Fall?\n\n# Defining the Scenarios\n\nIn its preparation for the Fall 2021 term, Brock envisages three potential scenarios:a)Course delivery with a significant return to on-campus instruction, complemented with online and hybrid delivery elements as determined through the usual academic planning process;b)Course delivery with some return to on-campus instruction, with significant online and hybrid delivery elements; and c) Course delivery almost entirely online, as has been the case for example during lockdown scenarios (i.e., March-April 2020 and January-February 2021).\n\n## Scenario A\n\n## TLDR\n\nCourse delivery with a significant return to on-campus instruction, complemented with online and hybrid delivery elements as determined through the usual academic planning process\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScenario A represents a public health situation in which vaccine roll-out has occurred according to the timelines laid out by the federal government, with individuals who want a vaccine able to get one by September. In this case, COVID cases may still occur but their frequency and the associated levels of hospitalization and mortality would be significantly decreased. Public health measures, including physical distancing requirements, will have been lifted, allowing for University facilities to be used as their normal capacity. This scenario also recognizes that instructor preferences regarding mode of course delivery may have changed given the COVID experience, which will likely lead to increased instructor requests to teach in online or hybrid modes. However, with the health emergency over, these requests could be dealt with through the usual department-and Faculty-based academic planning processes.\n\nFor Scenario A, the primary guide in determining mode of instruction will be departmental decision-making around pedagogical and program considerations as translated through the academic planning process.Departments will determine which courses are most appropriate to be offered on campus, with some percentage of the programs offered on-line or in a hybrid format. In this respect, planning for Scenario A will largely be decentralized and will most closely resemble the usual academic planning process.For planning purposes, the Registrar will work with the Deans initially to create a timetable that reflects Scenario A, with the understanding that adjustment to Scenario B may be required prior to the publishing of the final timetable in April if the public health news suggests reducing in-class instruction would be prudent. Planning for Scenario B will take place during March in preparation for any needed changes.\n\n## Scenario B\n\n## TLDR\n\nCourse delivery with some return to on-campus instruction, with significant online and hybrid delivery elements\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScenario B represents a situation where the public health conditions are steadily improving but some precautionary measures would still be required. Given that the public health situation will continue to evolve over the next several months in line with the progress of the vaccine roll-outand other factors, the University needs to plan for flexibility while ensuring the continuing safety of students, faculty and staff. In this scenario, the University needs to be as open as possible while still respecting public health guidelines, including physical distancing requirements,and their associated impact on classroom capacity.\n\nPlanning for Scenario B will be more complex and will require the prioritization of course offerings and their reconciliation with classroom capacity,given prevailing or probable public health restrictions.In this context, the parameters for scheduling will include the following: \u2022At least 50%of courses would involve some on-campus element;\u2022Of that proportion, a minimum of 25% of instruction would take place fully on-campus and a minimum of 25% of instruction would take place using blended or hyflex delivery(e.g.,with the possibility of alternating on-campus weeks for seminars,online lectures but with on-campus seminars);\u2022The remaining 50% or less of instruction would take place fully on-line, either synchronously,asynchronously, or a combination of both.Under current physical distancing requirements, five of Brock\u2019s classrooms can hold over 40 students and nine can hold between 18 and 40 students.We thus anticipate that,unless physical distancing requirements are loosened or removed, in Scenario B most courses over 40 students would continue to be offered online through either synchronous or asynchronous delivery. Seminars, labs, and portions of courses (such as secondaries) would be held on campus as much as possible.In Scenario B, the priorities for fully on-campus instruction would include the following:\u2022Laboratory and seminar sections and classes involving hands-on learning\u2022Courses in the performing and visual arts with experiential components\u2022Graduate classes\u2022Courses in programs that require on-campus learning to meet accreditation requirements\u2022Courses whose requirements cannot be adequately met on-line\u2022Small sections of less than 40 students\u2022Other priorities as identified by Deans\n\n## Scenario C\n\n## TLDR\n\nCourse delivery almost entirely online, as has been the case for example during lockdown scenarios (i.e., March-April 2020 and January-February 2021).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScenario C would occur only in the case of a deteriorating public health situation and the imposition of future lockdowns. In this scenario, on-campus instruction would occur exceptionally and only where public health guidelines permitted. As has occurred during the lockdown in Winter 2021, priority would be assigned to courses that require access to on-campus equip mentor hands-on learning, such as labs, and to small graduate seminars. The principles used to adjudicate on-campus delivery for Winter and Spring/Summer 2021would be used again, with Deans asked to submit requests for on-campus delivery for approval by the Provost. Approved courses would be required to develop safety and mitigation plans to be approved by Health &amp; Safety. While we hope to be beyond the stage of the pandemic in which lockdowns are common by Fall 2021, we need to consider the possibility of this scenario nonetheless.",

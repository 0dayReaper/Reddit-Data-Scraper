My past 2 years I had a GPA of 3.67.\n\nNot amazing but since then I\u2019ve worked in public health and now I want a Masters.\n\nI want to attend Brock but their minimum admissions average is A- (80%) the last 2 years of undergrad.\n\nI fulfill the other requirements.\n\nShould I bother applying with my GPA?",

Also assuming that your 3.67 GPA is based on a 4.0 scale, it should be enough to reach the admissions criteria. But based on experience grades aren't everything, make sure you have a solid letter/statement of intent and if you have relevant experience make sure those are clearly highlighted on your CV and in your statement.",

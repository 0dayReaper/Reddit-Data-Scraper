So for me my first chunk of 5.0 was below 80% and wasn't dean's list, but my next chunk of 5.0 (Year 2) had over 80% average across those credits and was dean's list, and same for my latest chunk for Year 3.\n\nBut if you're still just talking about your first year and are not done your second year, then yeah don't need to worry about upper years yet.",

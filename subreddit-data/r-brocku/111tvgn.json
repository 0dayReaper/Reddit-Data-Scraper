            "comment": "It\u2019s almost entirely financial accounting type math, reminds me of ACTG 1P91 in difficulty level. However, you\u2019re given lots of examples to aid homework. Three assignments, class participation mark, and an email exam. No groups, no quizzes.\n\nIt\u2019s not crushing but if you hate math I wouldn\u2019t describe it as a simple business elective. However, it has not taken up much time for me this semester, and the prof is good. Hardly anyone participates in class, don\u2019t know if they are lost or just disengaged generally. ENTR 3P93 however has no math, and is all theory.",

Otherwise I could see finishing four years and having nothing to show for it. Which is why there is a big focus on assembling a portfolio throughout the program. There\u2019s a pretty big pipeline into video games from the program, but basically anything to do with digital humanities is included. Web design, data science, art, project management. The profs are generally stellar as well.",

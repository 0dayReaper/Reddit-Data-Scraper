However, prospects look good if you search for \"systems analyst\" related jobs, many in the US I've found pay 90k+ USD, pretty wild, and not even senior roles.\n\nI'm in the concentration. Almost all of my 3PXX and 4PXX ITIS courses are this year, so far they're easy but it's only just started. I finish in the summer. They are very, very group-work heavy.",

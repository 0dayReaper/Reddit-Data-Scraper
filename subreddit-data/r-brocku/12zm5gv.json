            "comment": "Personally I suggest taking electives that you find interesting rather than \u201cuseful-to-your-degree\u201d since it will be a lot easier to do better in a course you\u2019re interested rather than one you aren\u2019t. Most people like to take bird courses to help boost their GPA verses taking electives that are useful since it makes it easier to stay in certain programs, achieve scholarships requirements or get higher grades to go to grad school.\n\nI am just about to graduate from BBA and although I didn\u2019t find the work particularly hard, I did find the workload to be a lot with most of my peers not graduating within 4 years (and instead opting to take less than 5 classes a semester). I chose the route of taking bird courses not to improve my GPA, but to lessen the work load so I could focus and study harder for mandatory classes.\n\n^ Just a few things to consider when deciding what electives to take, imo it\u2019s best not to overextend yourself.",

What is the admission average for Ontario high school graduates? How difficult is the program to learn, is it hard to achieve an average score of 70%? (It\u2019s an honour-only degree I believe)\n\nAny information is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Not in the program, but have taken IASC courses for my electives (the GAME program has a lot of IASC classes), the GAME labs are well equipped, and are open 24 hours a day to GAME students and certain IASC classes only. GAME students use the labs in their free time to play games since the machines run anything, and they're stocked with consoles too. I met most of the profs when I participated in a halloween gamejam they ran (I do sound design), they all seem dedicated to their craft. My IASC classes are some of my highest marks.\n\nAlso you write in complete sentences, you're ahead of 80% of folks in university already, haha. You're a shoe-in!",

So far I would say he is satisfied with everything. 3 weeks is not enough to truly rate a program but having access to the labs 24/7 is really nice. From what i have heard, the labs have ps3, ps4, x one, x360, wii u. You have to choose between game programming and game design. They have different courses and depending on which aspect of game dev u like u can go either way. \n\nBy the way, He goes to Niagara college once a week since the program is a double degree major.",

            "comment": "I just finished my first year in the program, 1f90 was very easy, with minimal assignments and papers. Also there was no exams and only two quizzes that were online and very general stuff. The topics discussed in the course are relevant to topics discussed on social media with social issues around the globe. Upper year courses in the program from what I\u2019ve seen are a lot more specific and interesting imo. I decided to double major with sociology because they are both similar in their requirements. I would recommend this program but maybe not on its own, perhaps with another major or a minor",

            "comment": "You can\u2019t take CHYS2p10 and psyc2p12 together. They\u2019re equivalent courses \n\nAlso are you allowed that many courses? Usually I see limits of 6, not 7 \n\nI\u2019m not a math girl and I hated 2f23, but I landed a 70 in it. Tim\u2019s a good prof if he\u2019s doing it this year. Chys was good - one debate presentation, I think one essay, and the rest were bite sized assignments or participation marks. Very easy. The others I haven\u2019t taken.\n\nI have heard 2p25 is ridiculously hard though. Interesting content but the prof makes the exams very tricky.\n\nIf 2p90 is with Scott, you\u2019ll love it. He\u2019s also a great prof.",

            "comment": "2F23 wasn't too bad, depends whether you can do math lol. Tim is an amazing prof tho! Go to tutorials, they tell you what will be on tests, and walk you through different types of questions\n\n2P01 was pretty easy, just make sure you talk lots in seminar and start looking for volunteer work early on\n\n2P20 was decent, very brain based if that is something you enjoy. Labs were interesting and fun, assignment answers were practically handed to you\n\n2P25 was stupid difficult, Prof Ashton makes his exams ridiculously hard for no reason\n\n2P90 was one of my favs, Scott is the best. No big tests or exams, just a few papers and biweekly quizzes. He gives automatic extensions, but every assignment is worth a lot, so be careful\n\nIf you're interested in mental health related topics, I recommend PSYC 2P15, loved that course and it wasn't too difficult. Depends on what you plan on taking later on/your strengths and interests.",

As of last year, part of the requirements for 2P01 is 40 hours of volunteer work before the end of the year\n\nBrock hosts a volunteer fair early on in the year, I'd recommend looking there. BBBS is also great, they give a lot of hours.\n\nGood luck with year 2!",

Reno is my prof and i think he\u2019s one of the best in the psych department. very approachable and fair. you have to stay on top of things in order to do well, you cannot let yourself fall behind in this course\n\n2p25 was okay. his midterms were tricky. if you don\u2019t wanna tank your average, i\u2019d suggest taking 2p30 instead. best of luck!",

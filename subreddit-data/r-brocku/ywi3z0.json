            "comment": "3P91 is Object Oriented Programming iirc? I highly advise holding off on that and taking the super course at the beginning of the spring term with Michael Winter (assuming it's still being offered). The super course is just a single week, Monday to Friday, with easy coding assignments each day and a reasonable exam at the end (yes, you still need to study for it). If you can manage to spare the week, it's well worth getting the half credit this way. I've heard the standard offering is ... not enjoyable.\n\n3P94, assuming it's still taught by Bockus is an interesting course. You'll learn some useful things about design, probably get fed up with the required readings and seminars early on, and question why anyone thought a crossword on a midterm was a good idea, but you'll walk away feeling as if you learned something. One thing I do recommend though is to go in with 1-2 other people you know and trust to pull their own weight for the group project. There were 4 phases of the project when I took the class, the first being a survey (which sucked), but the remaining 3 phases of design, critique, and presentation were enjoyable. It's a serious amount of work though and cannot be taken lightly if you want a respectable mark.",

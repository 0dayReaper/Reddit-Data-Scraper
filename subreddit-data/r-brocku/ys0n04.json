How you are finding it and that kind of thing!\n\nI also am curious how long it took to find out if you got accepted into the program? it\u2019s only been a month since I applied but I\u2019m curious when other people typically found out if they were accepted.\n\nThanks so much in advance!",

You can possibly maintain a part time job while in the program but I had to quit my full time job. \n\nClinicals are very hands on so be prepared to step out of your comfort zone. Advocate for yourself. \n\nThe profs are great and understanding most of the time. A crazy amount of self studying is needed to do well and maintain an 80. This is not undergrad there is no room for slacking. \n\nBecause the class size is small, you get to connect with your profs. You are also given plenty of opportunities to practice lab skills. The lab instructors are awesome (except for one or two lol)\n\nIf I missed anything feel free to pm me! :) \n\nGood luck! I hope you get good news :)",

I was also looking into the program.\nAnd have a few inquiries if you can help out \n\n1) How does the crazy clinical hours work out with the classes and finals? When I was reading into the course description  it said the last 2 weeks there's 32 h of clinical and if I'm not mistaken there's still 5 courses (3 hours each) and your also prepping for finals all at the same time? It sounds insane\n2) Do you have the same profs for all the courses? Are your lab coordinator  the prof as well?\n3) Do you get options for your clinical? Do you have to find it yourself? \n4) How are marks distributed?  I know you mentioned there's  assignment  every week , is there alot of weight to them or more distributed through exams or even practical and lab works?\n\n\n5)What have you liked or disliked so far\n6) what are your tips for anyone going into the program.\n7) if you don't mind me asking what program and school were you in prior to this and how would you compare it?\n\nThank you in advance for the loaded questions",

                            "comment": "1. Clinicals hours are during the week so you won't have classes on the days you have clinicals but the workload is heavy (e.g. post clinical reflections and worksheets). Usually assignments and midterms are scheduled so you don't have 10 things due in a week but expect at least an 1-3 assignments due each week. If it gets too overwhelming sone professors are very understanding and do offer extensions without any penalties so that has been super helpful. Your clinical instructor will be the one to decide when your clinical assignments are due and usually they are not very accommodating. The last 2 weeks are the consolidation weeks where you have a consecutive days (1-3) or 2 per week for 2 weeks of clinicals just before final exams. These are supposed to be the final clinicals where they assess your progress and you get a pass/fail basically. They do try to schedule these so its not too close to finals. And 2/5 classes did not have a final so we only had 3 finals to prep for. If you start studying early it's not as overwhelming. It's not like undergrad at all, but it is doable. \n\n2. Different profs, 2 courses have the same profs. the rest don't. Lab coordinators are not profs. They are separate but they teach the content and practical skills that you will be utilizing during clinicals (but a lot of the skills you learn at the actual clinical setting). \n\n3. We had an option for location of clinical placement in term 2 (they will give you options and you have to pick one, it's based on fcfs or a random draw if too many people want the same location). I'm not sure if they will be able to accommodate options again in the following terms so don't expect it every term. \n\n4. Marks are distributed fairly but the midterms for some courses can be weighed heavily especially if its just one midterm for that class. Lots of essays and assignments. Currently in term 2 our weekly assignments for one course are 5% each so it really depends on the professor. Some major essay assignments can be worth 15-25% - usually just 1 or 2 of these for the course. There are no lab assignments, you just have to show up and participate. If you miss a lab you have to make up for it before your clinicals start. Strict lab etiquette. \n\n5. Likes: I love the people I have met though the program and my profs, everyone is very supportive and want you to succeed and are willing to accommodate when feasible. Some assignments are fun esp. term 2. Clinicals are an amazing experience and I have learned a lot in a short amount of time. Dislikes: class schedule too spread out in term 1, some lab instructors were rude and passive aggressive. There were a lot of unknowns  when we didn't know who are clinical instructors were, when we were starting etc. but that is because the program is brand new and they were figuring it out. \n\n6. Don't really have any tips ahaha. Just that you will have to have great time management skills, the content isn't hard, its the load. Talk to your profs, they will be more than happy to support your needs but they expect you to ask them instead of just expecting leniency. I have a 19 month old so there were days I just needed extra time or a break and they were very understanding. \n\n7. I graduated from Brock in Med Sci in 2019 and worked for a bit then applied to this program in 2022. I loved Brock for undergrad and I love it now so it wasn't any different for me. \n\nSorry for the late reply- I had a lot of assignments and a toddler hehe\n\nedit: wording",

I also had pretty good references  which I believed helped me alot. \nThey do look at an overall requirements  so don't be discouraged . They do require quite a bit of letters and information  but if you have the resources ( references) and close enough marks definitely  give it a go as every year the entrance will depend on all who apply. \nHope this helps!",

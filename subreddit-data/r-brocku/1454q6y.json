            "comment": "Depends on the professor somewhat but if you like to have the content of the course spread over two semesters (1F92) or if you can handle learning the content in one semester (1P98) then either choice will not be hard as long as you keep on top of things and do practice problems. If I had to choose, 1F92 is the easier option out of the two imo.\n\nSo if you picked 1F92, that means you have one full credit which is the equivalent of two one-half credits. If you picked 1P98, then that means you only have one-half credit so you\u2019ll need to pick another one-half credit course to fill that gap in your program requirements. Since it is an elective, it can be any course you want/are allowed to take. And example would be choosing STAT 1P98 and ITAL 1P96 instead of choosing STAT 1F92. \n\nFor future reference: Courses with \u201cF\u201d in the code are full-year (two semester) courses and equal to One Credit and courses with \u201cP, Q, or sometimes V\u201d will be half-credit courses or 0.5 credits. Hope this helps!",

But the rest of the exam i did pretty well!! Good luck with that mate",

            "comment": "I took 1p98, I didn\u2019t take data management in high school and it wasn\u2019t too bad (I got 86), but generally 1f92 is meant for people who didn\u2019t take data management because the course content is more spread out and you have more time to understand the concepts. 1p98 is generally meant for people who already have a basic understanding of stats because it moves fast since it\u2019s the same content but half the time. If you take 1p98 you get a half elective credit meaning you can take any course available to fulfill the remaining half credit in your course load, since 1p98 is only for a semester while 1f92 is for the whole year. If you took data management or you\u2019re a quick learner I\u2019d recommend 1p98 so you don\u2019t have to do stats for a whole year, but if you need more time to understand the content take 1f92",

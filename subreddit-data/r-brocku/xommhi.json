You can also sign up for events through ExperienceBU. As someone said you can enter the E-Sports club here (there is a discord link on their club info page.)\n\nAs for Music, I don't think there is a Music club but there is different ensembles available for non-music majors (I know cause I want to join too.) but they are more like courses that you need to audition for. Info for those are here [https://brocku.ca/miwsfpa/music/play-at-brock/#1594938460442-2e83ee5a-6b71](https://brocku.ca/miwsfpa/music/play-at-brock/#1594938460442-2e83ee5a-6b71) \n\nAuditions happened in August but you can also prepare for Auditions for next year, but do keep in mind this isn't a club but instead a course available for anyone with the skills for it.",

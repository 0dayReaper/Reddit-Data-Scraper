That said, the people behind the scenes setting this up are extremely credible and will likely create the program to be very relevant and useful. Not too familiar with everyone involved, but Prof. Anteneh Ayanso has had a big role in this, so perhaps looking into his background may give you a better idea of what to expect.",

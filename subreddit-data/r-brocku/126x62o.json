    "postText": "Hi there! I'm an international student that recently got accepted on a full-ride with a GA position for the MA in Game Studies.  \n\n\n I want to talk to someone who is in the program or has graduated from the program and hear more about their experience and ask some questions.  \n\n\nI would be extremely grateful as I am very excited by this offer, but I want to know more about the curriculum and the careers people have afterward. Thanks in advance!",

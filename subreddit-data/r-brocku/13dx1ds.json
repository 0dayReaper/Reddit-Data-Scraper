But I've emailed the Professor (a week ago) and multiple people have asked for it in the forum post but she doesn't seem to be responding to anyone. The Syllabus she posted is incomplete and contains dates for the summer term. I don't understand why it seems like a hard task..this course doesn't have any new lectures everything is prerecorded 2 years ago.",

I had it last year and she didn't post the syllabus until a month and a half in.\n\nThe breakdown is 5 journal entries due mid-term, 1 midterm project, 5 journal entries due at the end of the term, and 1 final essay\n\nYou won't have anything due until the middle of the course so don't worry.",

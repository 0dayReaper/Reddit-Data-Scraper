Is it challenging enough to study at Brock?\n\nWhat about the city you are living in? Is it safe enough? \n\nThank you for your comments! Deciding which school to choose :)",

They offer weekly meet ups of only the internationals etc. \nIf you live off campus tho and you might not be part of the main ethnicities represented here, it can feel pretty isolating. The city is really bad for student life but as long as you are around campus, you can make it work.",

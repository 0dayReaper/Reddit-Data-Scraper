As someone who took one of these and thought it was going to be easy as it was said to be a bird course, it certainly was not. If you are not interested in the subject then it immediately is going to be more of a pain in the ass than even what your major courses are. If you are interested in history then take history because you will actually want to learn. Don\u2019t just take something because one person found it easy, figure out what you like and then base what course you will take off that. Also remember you are paying like 1,800 for a full credit so do you really want to waste that on something you don\u2019t care about? \n\nOne course I would recommend is INDG 1F90, which is indigenous studies, I found it very interesting and also I think it is important we understand other cultures and others points of view especially given that this is their lands. Additionally it was not overly hard. But yet again what interests myself may not interest you.",

It may not be hard, but it was absolutely poorly taught when I took it, frustrating, and mind numbing. Also it used the exact same textbook as COMM 1F90, a MUCH better course that oddly is not a context credit.\n\nHIST 1F95 was pretty good, the prof I had was super into the subject so that made it enjoyable for me. If you find essays easy, it was mostly essays when I took it.\n\nThank you for listing all the courses too. Most of the posts on this subreddit are like \"bird course???? plessss?\" or \"need a scienc cred it help me\"",

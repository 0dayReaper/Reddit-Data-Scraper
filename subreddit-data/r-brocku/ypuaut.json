Then go ham at the zone for as long as you like! Don't forget to clean your equipment!",

If you go up one level you will find all of the lifting machines and if you go to the second level you will find all of the cardio machines. They also have personal trainers there that can help you if you\u2019re stuck with anything.",

I work there and we have to count how many people are in the zone each hour, and its almost always 90-140 people between those hours (excluding friday night). The least busy hours are from open-11am, friday night, and weekends. But every worker in the zone is a personal trainer and will be happy to help you if you have any questions about how to use the equipment or do a certain exercise. Just make sure you have a wristband from the checkin desk, keep your shoes on, dont wear jeans lol! Have fun :)",

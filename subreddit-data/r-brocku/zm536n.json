Course content can be a little dry if you\u2019re not interested in it.\n\nEcon 2p35- Economics of Pandemics- New Course and New Professor might be worth a shot.\n\nEcon 2P46- Economics of China with Qian Liu- good professor and goes over interesting content.\n\nEcon 2P90- Intro to Econometrics with Qian Liu- same reason mentioned above.\n\nEcon 3p13- Multinational Economics with Roelof Makken- make sure to pay attention to what he says during lectures rather than the slides as that\u2019s what he considers important for exams/tests but he likes to meet with students over coffee or his office hours and is interesting to talk about economics and business with him.\n\n\nECON 3P90- Econometrics (if you have the prerequisites)- great professor who goes over the material thoroughly and very nice\n\n\n\nTake These courses if you want a challenge or a little on the harder side:\n\nEcon 2p30-math methods with Lester Kwong\nEcon 3p92- Forecasting with Time Series with JF Lamarche",

Thinking about applying to brock next cycle but I am having trouble choosing between medical sciences and psych. \n\nCan any current/graduates from both of these programs give me some insight into what both programs are like? I.e(research/volunteer opportunities, career prospects, competitiveness, what has a better school-life balance, etc).\n\nHas anyone from either of these programs attended medical school?\n\nThanks!",

Brings both in but is very math / science oriented &amp; you can pick between streams (neurobiology, neuropsychology, neuro motor, neuro computing, etc.). Gives you pretty much all of the pre req\u2019s for most Ontario Med schools too if you\u2019re considering!",

            "comment": "I graduated from Medical Science last year. \n\nIt was a decent program, if you get into the Med Plus program (an experiential learning program ontop of the medical science program) you'll be more likely to get good research and volunteer opportunities, but there are some opportunities you can still access as a general student. \n\nAs for career prospects, unless you continue in school (med school, masters, etc.) there are very few job opportunities in the healthcare field. I ended up coming back to school for a degree in TR because I just couldn't find a decent job in the Healthcare field with only a BSc (like obviously you could work in a hospital as a receptionist or a ward clerk, but nothing hands-on medically) \n\nI worked part-time throughout the school year (~25 hours a week), which made the school/life balance really difficult. By the time I finished school, got home from work, and did my homework, it was already late at night, so there was little opportunity for me to ever really do anything else. If you have the ability to not work, I would suggest that so that you do have time for yourself to relax and have fun.",

            "comment": "Although I\u2019m not enrolled in either of these programs at Brock, my friends are. Based on conversations I had with them and the few courses I\u2019ve taken from those programs, psychology is a lot of writing. Psychology has super interesting facts though! Look at the undergraduate calendar for both programs and see what courses you\u2019d have to take for each program. You might find courses for one program more interesting depending on your tastes. \n\nThe professors for the medical sciences program tend to be nicer as well so it\u2019s easier to make good prof-student relationships with them. From those relationships, you can be able to ask for research/volunteer opportunities. Just as a heads up, you will have to fulfill med school requirements (math, chem and physics) as electives.\n\nFor career prospects, I suggest you take a look at the links I attached below. Brock gives you a quick run down of possible career options.\n\nNotably, medical sciences is very competitive. As for school-life balance, that\u2019s all dependent on you. First year is to make you used to the work load of uni but the content is almost all review from high school. If you are able to manage your time better while learning entirely new concepts in subsequent years, you\u2019ll have a great balance. If you\u2019re the type of student that needs to put in that extra effort to understand things and get a 90 then you might have less of a social life (like me). High school is very different from university though. Working towards 90s in uni is the equivalent to trying to get 100%s in high school (at least in my experience). I\u2019m assuming you want to go into medicine so I\u2019m going to be straight up, work your ass off these next 4 years so you can reach your dreams. Friends come and go but the feeling of not fulfilling your dream stays with you forever. Don\u2019t come to university with the attitude to party but instead, come with the mindset to work hard. You can party occasionally but every single course counts so much that even one bad grade could drop your GPA dramatically. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend medical sciences because it\u2019s competitive. No one wants to help each other. Finding jobs with that program might be harder as well if you can\u2019t get into med school. I recommend looking into biology/chemistry-focused programs. For these, most med school requirements are often program requirements so you have space to take fun electives (take ASTR 1P01 and 1P02) \n\nIf you still really can\u2019t decide between the two, you can always do a double major or a major and a minor. Switching programs is not such a huge issue either (although it is quite stressful initially, the extra year in uni might give your more research/volunteer opportunities. You might not even need that extra year if the program requirements between med sciences and psych are similar)\n\nNo matter what you choose, best of luck and I hope you love your future experiences at Brock \ud83d\ude0a Hopefully someone more knowledgeable about the programs comments too!!\n\nhttps://brocku.ca/ccee/wp-content/uploads/sites/68/DEG-AHS-Medical-Sciences.pdf\n\nhttps://brocku.ca/programs/undergraduate/psychology/",

    "postText": "I'm looking for off-campus halal food near Brock. Preferably food that isn't Middle Eastern or south Asian (since I'm already used to that kind of food) however, if there is a really good noteworthy place that fits in that category then it's fine. I'm mostly looking for food I don't usually eat. Also any reasturaunt that has good vegetarian or seafood options or something like that.",

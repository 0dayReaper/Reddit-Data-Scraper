    "postText": "So i\u2019m currently a second year humanities major, but am aiming to switch that to a psychology major, as all my first year classes I took were psych prerequisites. \n\nAnyways, I know for year 2, some Psyc prerequisites are Psyc 2F23 and Psyc 2P01, but i\u2019m wondering if these are written to take under prerequisites if they\u2019re mandatory to take or not. \n\nBecause I struggle with math and I know Psyc 2F23 is based on math, and 2P01 requires volunteer hours that i\u2019m worried I won\u2019t have the time to get. So are these mandatory or optional to take?\n\nAlso, this might be a dumb question but is there social sciences major offered in Brock or is it just majors like (psych, soc, etc) that are under the faculty of social sciences? \n\nI\u2019m just struggling with how hard psych courses are looking for year 2\n\nIf anyone can help with my questions, I\u2019d really appreciate it. Thank you!",

I went to my college grad and found the whole thing pretty boring, so I figure it'll likely be the same for uni. But, I figured I'd ask in case someone has a reason I haven't considered.",

Someone (like maybe yourself) would want their efforts to be appreciated (if at all) through another way. You don\u2019t have to go to grad if you don\u2019t want to! \ud83d\ude0a It\u2019s all about personal choice and I\u2019m sure you can celebrate in a far better way",

You've worked so hard for the last 4+ years might as well celebrate it (plus there's free snacks afterwards, so win-win, right?)",

You may feel things are blurred and trail into eachother otherwise. It's the same reason you should attend funerals. It really is the same as a funeral in a way. That's why it should be boring.",

    "postText": "\nFirst off, I just want preface by saying this was my last exam in my degree and my opinion is probably skewed because of how much I didn't enjoy prof R.V. (And no I didn't bomb the exam that's not why I'm writing this).\nI want to express how unprofessional both the midterm and exam went. Not having exams printed out along with some students getting a different course's midterm is crazy. \nProf R.V recycles lecture slides year after year which makes for extremely dry classes. He also recycles lab exams - 95% of the lab exam is the exact same from previous years. I just think that his lack of effort as a professor really rubs off on how his course is perceived by students. \nLastly I think this course covers a lot of basic material that's taught in other KINE courses (3P91 for example). Which makes me wonder why it's mandatory? And should it be audited? I know it's surprising, but redrawing graphs on exams doesn't teach me anything.\nAnyways, if there are any other kine students out there - share your thoughts!!",

They complement each other as one is about training prescription and the other is physiology to training. \n\nMy biggest laugh about the midterm fuckup is how nobody realized they were writing the wrong midterm.",

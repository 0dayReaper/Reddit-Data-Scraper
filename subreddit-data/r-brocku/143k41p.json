When I took it the prof (great prof, Geoff Hoover) mentioned the course average is around 68%. I ended with an 82 but that was a struggle as I did not leave myself much time to focus on the course during that semester. This is not a bird course for sure.\n\nHoover posts videos on YouTube (though removes them at the end of each semester, so act fast if you want to check these out), so you can see what it's like: https://www.youtube.com/@FNCE2P91/videos",

But I think you just need to have your machine setup with BlueJ and follow the tutorials in the class.\n\nThe tutorials are more like extra/additional help to understand the materials/lab.\n\nEDIT: If you need help setting up BlueJ/understanding anything, please let me know, I'll be happy to help!",

It\u2019s the same professor either way so it won\u2019t be easier from that perspective.",

Marcel is the professor ATM, I think, and he is a great professor, and he will also teach econ 3p90. 2p30 is expotentially harder than most 3rth year classes in my opinion, after the first midterm. In the spring/ summer, you will get bodied. I would suggest taking 3rd year macro in the fall. The profesor who usually teaches the class is off next year, but usually it is more theory based with  an ok amount of math. econ 3p21 has a super hard final that pretty much determines the entire course in the last few classes, the math gets nuddy. So if you take econ 3p22, econ 2p90, and econ 2p30 it is doable. Just never miss a single class of 2p30. \n\nIf you want to make your life easier, take an elective for econ this summer so you have 1 course less in the fall. Or take 2 electives so that you only have to take 4 courses per term.",

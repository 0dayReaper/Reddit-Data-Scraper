    "postText": "Hi guys, I\u2019m from the University of Guelph and most first year science courses are harrrrd - I know they\u2019re hard everywhere but after discussing this with students from other schools and our workload seems heavier by far. \n\nAnyways, I was wondering how the first year biology, calc 1, and gen chem 1 and 2 are in summer school here. Has anyone taken it or have any idea what schools I should go for for an easier workload?\n\nThanks everyone :)",

Brock\u2019s second year Chem courses (especially organic Chem) is known for students to struggle with. To be frank, if the work is put in they\u2019re not that hard. Students that work hard usually crush those courses. That might be something to focus more on than trying to transfer and find easier programs. You\u2019ll run into the same problem elsewhere and waste your time (and money) if you\u2019re looking for an easy ride in the hard sciences.\n\nGuelph has a hard first year, from what I\u2019ve heard. But, the same goes to other schools where here second year usually weeds people out. Putting the work in will make you a better student overall.",

Depending on the prof, there\u2019s quizzes or homework as well. For biology, it\u2019s very lab heavy, but I would say the workload is easier than chem.",

For Calculus, Brock has MATH 1P97 which is calculus for business, Econ, and non-physical science majors and MATH 1P06 which is Calc 2 for science majors.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m taking first year chem, bio, and calculus (1p97) right now and I\u2019d say they aren\u2019t too hard to do well in if you put in the work. They all have a pretty heavy workload though. Chem has weekly assignments, tutorial exercises, labs, and textbook questions for extra credit. Bio doesn\u2019t have as many smaller components like chem, but the labs are more work and the reports are much more time consuming. Both chem and bio have a midterm and final exam. Calculus has weekly assignments that are either online (like an online quiz) or written (you have to show your work, more work than the online ones) as well as two midterms and a final exam. However this is all in the normal year and I don\u2019t know what it would be like in the spring/summer, or if they are even offered",

I would ask your co-op  counsellor the following:\n\n* Is rearanging your schedule an option? Perhaps you could move things around to have another co-op term later.\n* Are any professors in your department in need of research assistants? That is a great way to get a 4 month  experience, although it may not pay as much.\n* Is there anything that can improve things at work for you?",

If students always leave after a term that kind of sours that relationship and the school doesn't really want that. I've literally had a friend go from a small firm to a big 4 and the school gave her shit for it, she even had to write a letter of apology to either the school or the firm. But, it's your career at the end of the day so I think you should do what is in your best interest and not what the school likes.",

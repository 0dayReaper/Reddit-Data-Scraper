As long as you put in the work and ask her for help you can easily get a 90. The prof is also very accommodating and helpful",

My biggest pointer would just be to do the practice questions and understand those as thoroughly as possible when studying. Almost all of the long answer practice questions were on the exams (just with different numbers/scenario, but very similar steps for solution). Besides that, as long as you show up and take detailed notes you will be fine. Oh and my lab TA was very open to helping with the practice questions as well.",

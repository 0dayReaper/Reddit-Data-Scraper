            "comment": "Depends on the course. \n\nI took a .5 (p) credit course last spring, psyc4p71. It ran over four weeks (not including the exam time), with two lectures and two seminars per week. It was pretty hectic. We had to lead a seminar (in groups), write an essay, and there was also a final exam.. My group was one of the first seminars, so I had to work on that while also working on the essay, which was due only 15 days after the course started. Having little knowledge of the subject going in, 15 days was not much time to develop a topic and write the thing, while working on my seminar prep AND keeping up with lectures. That said, overall it probably wasn't much more work than doing a regular five course semester. But because it was all the same topic, it felt very rushed. \n\nI also took a 1 credit course over the summer, wgst1f90. It also ran over four weeks. This class had one lecture per day, two forums per week, an essay, and a \"take home\" exam (four essay questions). This class felt less hectic because there was no seminar to lead and we had more time to write our essay, but it was a lot keeping up with the lectures and I did not do all the readings. \n\nMy take was - they're very fast paced but if you're used to doing five classes at a time, you'll probably fare ok. But each class/prof is going to be different, so some classes will be harder than others in the accelerated format.",

I had 4 hour lectures everyday (5 days a week), one class was online the other was in person. And that other 0.5 credit I took was a 1 month course, it had 3 two hour lectures each week with a 1 hour seminar before each lecture",

Usually there would be 4 hours of lecture a week (i.e. two 2 hour long lectures per week)\n\nAlthough there are some courses that may run for a shorter time, especially in the summer session",

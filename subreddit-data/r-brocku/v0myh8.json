    "postText": "Was sitting in the grass by Mackenzie Chown Complex reading, felt a big ol' ant crawl onto my lower back and went to pick it off. Sure enough I found myself holding a friggin' tick in my hand.\n\nFlung that thing away and did a tick-check in the nearest bathroom asap xD. So beware! Sitting in the grass sure is nice, and I guess the ticks know it too. I'll be sticking to the picnic tables.",

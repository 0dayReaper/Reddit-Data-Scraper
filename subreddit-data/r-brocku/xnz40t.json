While the discussion posts aren't too hard, the amount of stuff we have to do each week seems like a lot i.e read 30 pages of textbook (which is honestly the bulk of the work), read 2 powerpoints, a document, answer a survey, and answer 3 discussion questions each week.",

I find that it saves me a lot of time while still understanding all the key concepts that are needed to do good in the course.",

            "comment": "I took BKin instead of BSc Kin. The biggest difference between the two is that BKin has more freedom to their electives whereas most of BSc Kin is more science-based electives. \n\nOverall the program is great but it\u2019s really how you make it out to be. One tip I can give is figure out what courses you want to take early so you can plan things out. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll miss out on some fun courses come 3rd and 4th year if you don\u2019t have the appropriate prerequisites.\n\nClasses can vary drastically overall. Most classes will have seminars or labs to solidify what is being learned in lecture. Most classes average to about 3-4 hours a week in-class/seminar/lab. Some courses have lab every other week but then require you to be there 2-4 hours. There\u2019s lots of opportunities for hands on learning, mostly in upper year courses but some opportunities throughout.\n\nAs for weeded courses, first year anatomy tends to be a difficult one if you don\u2019t attend office hours or put in the effort. KINE 2P84 is a second year course that people struggle with as well due to shear volume of info. Outside of those, it\u2019ll depend on your preferences and areas of interest.\n\nAs for labs, do you mean the ones you do in-course or research labs?\n\nAs for job market, within the field there\u2019s a few options but it depends on what you\u2019d want to specialize in. Comparatively to Toronto, there\u2019s less obviously, but the industry is growing down here.",

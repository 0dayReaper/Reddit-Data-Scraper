I focus so much better, sleep better, my anxiety is way less, and I don\u2019t feel as lonely. I know not everyone can relate, but I just know personally online was the best thing for me. Really wish my program offered more online options",

I couldn't justify paying for a place to live in st Catharines for just two days of in person classes, so I'm commuting over an hour both ways for an 8am class. I just wish the university either commited to all online or all in person because at least for me this blended thing sucks.",

I wish they at least gave an option, then everyone would get a choice. It\u2019s so easy to just set up a zoom call during an in person lecture.

I never did online classes before starting my b.Ed and I was a bit disappointed when I found out the first 2 weeks were gonna be online but since I\u2019ve had to go back in person I\u2019ve felt exactly the same things. I heard today that York is all online, I wish Brock had at least given us an option \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

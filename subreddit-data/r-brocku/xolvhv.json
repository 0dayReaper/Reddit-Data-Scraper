Like another mentioned, just be a pro at his example questions, and suggested study work. His questions followed those for my class.\n\nAlso he was like, undergrad prof of the year at Goodman last year, he's a great prof, very helpful. Just bring any troubles you have with questions to him, don't leave studying to the last minute where you won't have time to seek his help.",

The best way to prepare for quizzes is to focus on example questions and try understanding them since most of his exam questions were very similar to example questions. I had done this course and exams online so I am not sure what it\u2019s going to be like in person. Overall he is a great prof and was very generous in allocating part marks.",

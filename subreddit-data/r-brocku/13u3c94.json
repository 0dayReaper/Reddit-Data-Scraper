Would it be possible to switch from labour study\u2019s to sport management as I have the grades to do it but they only gave me labour studies as an alternative before I even received my math credit.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s quite easy to switch majors at Brock, especially after first year. The key is to switching into SPMA is to to ensure you keep a strong average in 1st year. I recommend you take all 4 intro LABR courses, but particularly 1P94 and 1P95 as these will have crossover with SPMA. Labour Studies also has course on collective bargaining, labour and employment law, arbitration, and labour of sport that are directly relevant to labour relations in what is a heavily unionized sports sector. This is why many SPMA majors minor in LABR.",

He wants to go into SPMA, so he should take SPMA focused classes with the goal of transferring into SPMA. If his end goal isn't labour studies, he benefits nothing from taking these courses. \n\nHis best course of action would be to take all the SPMA courses he can take along with the easiest electives (which are not LABR courses) and finish with a strong average to strengthen his chances of transferring. I think it's dishonest and very disingenuous to be coming into all of these threads and recommending LABR courses as easy electives when there are much more preferable options (see: ASTRO, ERSC, etc.).",

These classes are typically full and priority is given to SPMA majors. Best course of action here might be to enrol in cross-listed courses until OP can switch.",

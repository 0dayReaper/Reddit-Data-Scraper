    "postText": "I just want to encourage anyone here who wants a hybrid option for this semester because they don't feel comfortable coming back to PLEASE email the school. The registrars office, central, the dean of your program, your profs. The more we let them know how we feel the better. This is not a move to try and not let in person happen, its just asking for a choice for people who cannot come back due to immunocompromised family members, travel  restrictions, etc. For people who want in person, this isn't against you at all. I think if people want to learn in person, they should have that choice too. but I don't think people who feel unsafe/uncomfortable should be forced to return right now. if you are feeling this way, please communicate your feelings and don't let your voice go unheard. there are lots of personal reasons someone might prefer online learning at this time, so please be respectful.",

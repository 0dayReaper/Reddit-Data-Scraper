    "postText": "I recently graduated from biological sciences and looking at doing a second degree in nursing, maybe after a year i could apply to the accelerated BN/MN too after i pick up the pre-requisites. \n\nI was wondering what the program is like? how difficult is it? (i had to take bio courses and organic chem so i feel i\u2019m prepared haha) What year do you start clinicals? are you marked on them? Do you enjoy it overall? \n\nMy original goal was med school with bio but covid killed my gpa, I feel i\u2019d enjoy being a psych or ER nurse, and I can always apply to med school, or do NP with nursing. There just seems to be a lot of avenues and what is there to do with a bio degree? \n\nAlso, what is the age like in nursing? I\u2019m 23 right now and just would feel weird being older than everyone in the class, would be normal if i was in a masters but with a bunch of first years idk \ud83e\udd74. Thanks for any input",

A good portion are like you where you aren\u2019t too young but you also aren\u2019t old. You just ended up changing paths later on. Totally normal. One of our student nurses was in her 30s with two kids. So don\u2019t feel weird about it",

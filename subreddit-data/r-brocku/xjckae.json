            "comment": "They warn you on the ticket prior of being towed. For me my 7th ticket said I would be towed next time, however I got an eighth ticket and didn't get towed. I didn't risk it after that. \n\nI've been told when they tow you they just bring you somewhere near the back of village residence but I can't confirm that. \n\nOtherwise there aren't really any spaces you can park without getting a ticket, they're pretty thorough.\n\nYou can park in zone 1 for free after 6pm and on weekends. Usually you can park wherever you want during these times because the ticket workers aren't on shift, but fair warning I have been ticketed on the weekend before. \n\nIt's also worth noting that 7 tickets is far cheaper than a pass so if you can get away with only that number in a semester then it is cheaper than buying a pass to repay them. However then your car is officially in their system which is not great.",

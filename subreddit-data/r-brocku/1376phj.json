    "postText": "i\u2019m in concurrent education@brock, i barely passed first year because of covid and second year i tried my absolute hardest and best but it still wasent enough. my avg is a 66% which means i didn\u2019t have enough to stay in the program for third year. i will be removed from the concurrent program and put into a child and youth program or be allowed to upgrade. I will be choosing the upgrade route. i am terribly disheartened and disappointed in myself for not trying harder. I did get my ish together and I did make an effort, i got good marks but i think it was one assignment and a seminar mark that fumbled me. I am so so so scared that I won\u2019t make the 70% next year, im from an indian background and failure isn\u2019t acceptable at all. i\u2019m scared that if i fail this coming year, I\u2019m gonna have to choose a new program and start all over again (4 more years) I don\u2019t know why i\u2019m posting this but i\u2019m so overwhelmed and stressed. i know it\u2019s just a me problem because everyone else is doing good and their succeeding. I just feel so alone in this situation and feel like i\u2019m the only one failing. i\u2019ve fallen in a terrible spiral and i just don\u2019t know what to do anymore. any guidance you have to offer, please do, i feel like giving up",

It can happen to anyone.\n\nI\u2019m a four-time college drop out, Brock is my fifth go at it where each year i\u2019ve upped my average from 60s/70s to 88 the last two semesters. I think for me the keys to success have been these things:\n1. Recognize that I cannot expect different results without doing something different.\n2. Actively stop making mistakes like leaving campus with work unfinished that I know I will not do at home.\n3. Create a chronological list of due dates, and work on things early. Always be working on things until I literally run out of things, and that\u2019s when I can relax (and there will be plenty of time left over).\n4. Do not fuck up my sleep schedule ever.\n5. Never skip class.\n6. Participate in class, makes it easier to retain information and succeed on tests.\n7. Successes will build confidence and lower anxieties/stress.\n8. Do not care about what any other student thinks, after Brock you won\u2019t see them again. For example, if no one is taking notes, is it weird if I take lecture notes? Fuck them, take notes! Recognize classmates actively make mistakes too or learn differently.\n9. Don\u2019t completely abandon social life, but learn to say no or end an engagement early. True friends will understand and hang in there. Friendship is an important spark of my motivation and zeal to improve.\n10. Don\u2019t forget about the spark that makes you want to complete school, like independence, financial security, making a difference, access to adventures, helping others, an enjoyable career, whatever. When I\u2019ve lost sight of that spark I question why I\u2019m working so hard and struggle to continue.\n\nGood luck to you! Failures or mistakes are learning experiences, they are still valuable for this reason. You likely were not set up for success, but now you\u2019re a little closer to it, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now.",

You are definitely not alone in that. \n\nYou should reach out to the mental health services offered by Brock, they can help you manage how you're feeling. Talk to an academic advisor, Brock has special programs for people in your situation, they can help you learn things like time management, essay writing, and other skills that will improve your performance next year. \n\nIt sounds like you know where you could have improved, you'll be able to apply that next year. Keep communication open with professors, TAs, academic advisors, and anyone else who can assist next year. They can help you stay on track and keep from getting overwhelmed. There's no reason you can't be successful going forward :)",

            "comment": "Hi there, I\u2019m not too sure if any of this will help you feel better but I was in the same boat as you this year. I passed exactly with a 70% just right after my last class had posted my mark, before that my average was sitting at a 67%. I\u2019m in my second year of Psych and it\u2019s honestly really difficult. My sister always reminded me that there\u2019ll be that one year that\u2019s really hard to maintain compared to all the other years. I thought I would\u2019ve got boot from the Honours stream and had to look into a different stream/program of Psych. Despite all the different changes in my study habits and no matter how hard I tried my best, it still wasn\u2019t the grades I expected or was proud of. All I did this whole school year was reach out to my academic advisor, even when I overthought about being annoying since I go back and forth with them, my academic advisor was extremely kind and helpful. She helped me look into options and what I could do if I didn\u2019t maintain my 70%. And I understand where you\u2019re coming from too. I\u2019m from a Filipino background and failing isn\u2019t acceptable either. But talking to someone within your family could also be helpful. My cousin and sister both just finished at Brock and I always go to them for advise. So if you ever need anyone to talk to, I\u2019m here!",

            "comment": "Its okay that you didn\u2019t get the 70, Brock has plenty of resources to help you be successful! The professors want you to be successful and pass all they ask is for you to do the work suggested. Covid was a tough time but anything can be achieved. Talk to your academic advisor they will be sure to guide you in the right direction. I didn\u2019t maintain my 70 the first year too however with the help of advisors and summer classes i was able to bump it up and keep it there. I come from a family that essentially demands success so i understand the stress and pressure that comes with it. Just remind yourself that school is a process where you find out who you are and what your passion is. Everything falls into place as long as you make the effort in your pursuits",

    "postText": "I have one year left on my undergrad and I was looking to tutor to have a part time job for the summer and the fall. I have done well in my chemistry courses and would like to tutor others at Brock. I see that Brock hires tutors for Brock learning services but only pays minimum wage (while charging 25 an hour). Has anyone worked there before and is it worth it? Does Brock have a private tutor marketplace where I could tutor privately? When I was at Waterloo they had something like that.\n\nI know CHEM2P20 and CHEM2P21 organic chemistry classes run in the summer so there may be some demand soon.",

Most students would rather go through learning services or through their TA to find people who tutor such as graduate students that offer private tutoring. Your main issue will be finding people as students who inquire about tutoring options will usually be directed to grad students. From an undergrad position you will be less likely to find students on your own unless they get referred to directly.",

    "postText": "Hello people of the sub reddit,\n\nI am planning to apply to brock next year and I was very worried if I matched the Admission requirements for the  University. I mailed the school the courses ill be graduating with and I got a reply that my subjects would match the admissions requirements. This should have been the end to my worrying but it is not and I am still very tensed if I match the requirements. What should i do? Is there any other way to confirm that I meet the course requirements?",

If you can run a little faster, you can go to McMaster.\u201d\n\nConsidering some of the dunces I\u2019ve met in my first year here, that can ring true somedays. you should be fine OP. If you care enough to be asking, you probably cared enough to make a good impression.\n\n\u201chard work beats talent when talent doesn\u2019t work hard.\u201d\nSpeaking as a former bright, but lazy student,  my life got a lot better when I started putting in the effort. Those 70\u2019s I used to be happy with are now 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s with that extra effort. Marks I couldn\u2019t have dreamed getting even two years ago. Anyone willing to put the work in can succeed, and I mean that in the best possible way. Brock is great for student assistance. \n\nGood Luck! I look forward to seeing you in September!",

Brock is rather lenient on admissions as well, so I think you\u2019re going to be just fine.\n\nEspecially with TGJ4M and MHF4U, if you\u2019ve got a decent average then I would be surprised if you don\u2019t get an offer",

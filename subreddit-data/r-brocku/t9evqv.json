Idk I just don\u2019t want to sit in the library alone all the time lol. so I was wondering if anyone else feels that way?",

I have friends at Brock but I don't have a friend group where we can all know each other mutually, share inside jokes, have sleepovers and watch movies together \ud83d\ude2d I literally see groups of friends walking around in campus and I just get jealous. Life is great. \n\nA lot of traditional methods like going to parties, residence, and clubs just aren't possible right now because of covid. Most of Brock's clubs are also for philanthropy not shared hobbies. I would reccomend talking to whoever sits next to you ten minutes before class starts, or after class ends just talk to a student you see sitting alone at a dining area. I know it's nerve-wracking but it isn't high school, you won't be well acquaintanted with someone just by being in the same class as them once a week. You need to talk to someone. Although good luck getting past the small talk of, \"Woah what's your program? Where are you from? What year are you in?\" my advice is to just overshare. That way you leave an impression and not seem boring. \n\nAnd hey, if you want you can shoot a DM I'm always down to talk to new people!",

            "comment": "There is nothing wrong or abnormal with the way you are feeling. I\u2019ve struggled with this alot over the years (I\u2019m in my fourth year now). I have friends, but a lot of them have their own \u201cgroup\u201d or closer friends that they turn to. And that\u2019s okay- I don\u2019t blame them. I wish I had a solid group sometimes to have plans with on the weekend and get involved. But over the years I\u2019ve kind of found strength in being a bit of a lone wolf. I\u2019ve really bettered myself over the years physically and mentally, and I think a big part of that is I never was heavily influenced by peers. I\u2019m in a place now where I try to remember I do have friends that care for me, so I shouldn\u2019t worry about the people that don\u2019t. My best advice would be to really focus in on what you love. If you\u2019re into working out, go to the gym and just say hey to someone! If you\u2019re religious, go to church by yourself and just go up to someone and introduce yourself. Maybe a friendship will form and maybe it won\u2019t. Just keep trying and know that you are not alone. I\u2019ve had my moments of feeling extreme loneliness, but honestly sometimes it helps to just get on the bus and go somewhere where there\u2019s people. Go to market and eat lunch alone, or say hi to a stranger. You\u2019re 100% not the only one going through this. I thought this was super lame of me at first, but I was feeling super depressed and lonely last semester, so sometimes I would literally go to Kelsey\u2019s or something and just eat by myself or have a drink at the bar. I would strike up a conversation with a random person and it just kind of reminded me I\u2019m not alone out there. It was very nerve wracking at first but it\u2019s something to try. Get comfortable with yourself. It\u2019s a skill to be \u201calone\u201d and be comfortable with that!",

That said, I can\u2019t recommend Mahtay cafe enough. The friends I did meet outside my original circle, I met at Mahtay. Go frequently, become a regular, and a bunch of awesome other regulars will naturally start talking to you over time. Plus, it\u2019s a great place to study and the owner, Chris, is so welcoming.",

Secondly, a good place is class or labs. You need some nerve but just talk with people that you see regularly! I left university as a whole with 3 friends. I still speak with them today. Majority of your friends will go their own way anyway so don\u2019t sweat it. I get the lonely feeling, believe ne",

I'm in med Sci and almost everyone i know in my program made their friend group within the first week of first year and never changed that group and certainly didn't let new people into their groups, so I understand how transferring halfway through the year would make things really difficult. And even clubs, I've joined a few and never really made friends from those either. I agree with what the person above me said though, labs and seminars are a good way to make friends. I've made a couple friends because we were lab partners or sat together in seminars, so I know it can be totally awkward to strike up a conversation with these people, but there's great friendship potential there in my opinion :)",

It\u2019s hard not starting with every else and feeling like you missed the part where everyone goes into groups and makes friends but I promise you thats not the case, there are so many students just like you. Transfer connect is a social group focused on social activities, making friends and just relaxing and having fun. There are students from many different programs and we\u2019ve had a few in biomed over the years. You can contact Monica through here to find out more about the group. https://experiencebu.brocku.ca/organization/transfer-connect The group is very laid back and you attend when you can and want to but it\u2019s never mandatory. This group has students from 18-70 years as transfer students come with different backgrounds and experiences and everyone is there to help each other and just have a good time.",

            "comment": "i\u2019m currently in my first year of medical sciences and med plus. the reason i chose medical sciences over other programs at brock is because of the flexibility of the program and the ability to choose electives that fit my career goals. there is definitely room to take electives that will help with the mcat and i\u2019m planning to take electives that would help me with it next year! the med plus program so far has been extremely helpful. it has many connections with a variety of organizations in the niagara region for students to volunteer and i\u2019m currently volunteering at a parasports organization where i help kids with disabilities to play sports! it\u2019s so much fun and so rewarding. there is usually 1 (sometimes 2) 2 hour med plus sessions a week where there is usually a guest speaker who talks about their career in healthcare or skills that will help us in our career development. we also do observationals where we are able to gain hands on experience in clinical type settings. we are also able to job shadow professionals in the healthcare field, but during covid they had to stop them and they are still working to get started with job shadowing again. from other students in upper years, i have heard that the med plus coordinators (pam and katrina, they\u2019re amazing!) help immensely with professional school applications. they are able to give great letters of recommendation, help build your application, hold mock interviews, and anything else you could need help with. there is an immense amount of support within the program that has made my time and money worth it. if your goal is medical school, they will help you work towards that goal starting in first year to help you really stand out on your application",

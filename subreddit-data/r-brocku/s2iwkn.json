    "postText": "Hey guys. Idk if anyone else has been feeling like this but I have been having some major issues with residence and not being able to go back. I understand why they've closed the residences and moved us online but I don't understand why we can't go get our stuff. I didn't have any in-person exams for the fall semester so I had to leave Dec 8th. When I left I had no idea that we wouldn't be back in-person or in residence. Since being online I've realized that I need a bunch of stuff from my residence to learn online from home. I've been trying to get back in to my room to get this stuff but they won't allow me access to my room and the only way I could get things from my room is if I let someone else go into my room and get my things. Like I have medications and very VERY NSFW personal items that I don't need other people snooping around my stuff. After weeks of emailing and begging residence to let me back in, they keep saying no. No matter what I say or ask. I'm posting this mostly just to see if there is anyone else feeling frustrated about this or if I'm the only one.",

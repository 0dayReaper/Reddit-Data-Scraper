    "postText": "For this pre-sem we're required to read a case study from the 16th edition textbook (about someone named Joe with a personality disorder). Apparently, its in chapter 12.1, but I am unable to find it in my textbook. I only have the 15th ed. textbook and am DESPERATELY hoping that someone with the newest textbook would be able to graciously send me the case study in order to do the pre-sem.\n\nThanks",

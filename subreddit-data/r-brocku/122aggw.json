I think the graduate programs might be better, because you'll probably get better lab experience. \n\nMy program (bio sciences) didn't have co-op when I first came to the school, though I think it does now. If you're gonna do STEM, I recommend one with co-op. STEM professors are hit or miss, as with any other programs.",

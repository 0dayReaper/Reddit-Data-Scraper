    "postText": "Thankfully, I got an admission offer for the Nursing program in September 2023. I accepted the offer on the applicant portal. Can someone kindly help me with my questions below?\n\n\\- Will I receive another email on what to do next?\n\n\\- The email address that I was assigned doesn't match my first and last name's initials, the first two letters of my student email address should be \"nc\" but I got \"at\" instead, is this common?\n\n\\-  Are mature students who already have a degree eligible to entrance scholarship?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

It's possible they reversed the order by now.\n\nI know when I was a mature student I was not eligible for the entry out of high school scholarships but the smaller scholarships were fair game",

This was causing lots of issues because it's time consuming to get these emails changed in all systems/class lists, especially when many students want these changes. So starting this year Brock has decided to randomize the letters of all new email accounts to reduce this issue.",

Both of my diploma and degree programs have a GPA of mid 90s.\n\nRegarding admissions, I was told that most admission offers are sent between February and March. I probably just got lucky, I am very thankful, or I sent too many emails as I am not expecting to receive an early admission.",

Reapplied after 3 years of bio with an 85 uni average and got in. It's really ridiculous but they get flooded with applicants so this is how they filter some I guess. Did you apply to the 4 year one or the chaotic accelerated program?",

I could maybe try and get into an easier nursing program then transfer to brock, they might allow that? Did you get accepted to the 2023 nursing program already? Or are you already in nursing?",

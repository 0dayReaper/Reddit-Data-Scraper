I don\u2019t have any experience in programming but I do want to learn a bit about it. Earl Foxwell is the professor I believe. How is the overall course load and pressure? Around how much time do I have to dedicate to the subject per day? Is it easy to pick up marks ?",

            "comment": "With no experience in programming at all, it could be a difficult time, especially with Earl teaching.\n\nOverall it's not a terribly hard course or anything but for an elective I think it's possibly a bad choice. Pretty time consuming, pretty stressful. \n\nIf things haven't changed since I took it 3 years ago you'll use Java and learn a lot of basic concepts to computer programming. The assignments and tests can be pretty painful.",

COSC 1P02 is a great course and Earl is a great teacher but I have heard that for students going in without programming experience, 1P02 is difficult.\n\n1P02 is great if you are planning a career in programming. If you just want to stitch an app together using API's and tutorials then I'd recommend learning on your own.\n\nIf you still want to go in I would start learning off the internet in your spare time.",

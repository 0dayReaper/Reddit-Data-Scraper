    "postText": "I already asked this a while back, but does anyone have any suggestions on some kind of easy-ish humanities courses for this upcoming semester? I need one more to help me transition into my new major easier, so I\u2019d like to take it easy next semester so an asynchronous course would be preferred, but if there are none available I\u2019ll take any suggestions. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Honestly any of the PCUL courses are SUPER easy. I can\u2019t remember the number but there was one where you could study comic books and video games in order to understand their narratives. When I took it we did Ms. Marvel Vol. 1, Wolf Among Us, Fables Vol. 1 and I believe some early Superman and Wonder Woman comics. \n\nUpdate: The course code MIGHT be PCUL2P93 aka Popular Narrative but I\u2019m not sure. \n\nThe first year Classics courses are also super easy- granted I am a History minor so, take that as you will. I took both the Classical Greece and Classical Rome courses and basically aced them due to how easily the course material was set up. I also highly recommend them simply because the professor is SUPER cool and has given out extra points on assignments for alliterative titles or if he likes your argument (my one friend had an argument in one of his first papers for a course with him where he compared Odysseus and Dracula and the professor loved it.) \n\nThere you go!",

Do they still count for a humanities context credit even though they\u2019re not on the list?",

I\u2019ve taken a course taught by Dr. Nick in the past and I did not think that he marked particularly hard. Before he started lecturing he was my TA for bioethics and he also lectured for philosophy of art and in both cases I would not say that he was a particularly strict marker. But I\u2019m also a Phil major so maybe I\u2019m not the best person to ask.",

    "postText": "So, in the 90s, there was a kinda surreal comic in the Brock student newspaper called \u201cBlik\u201d.\n\nI didn\u2019t attend Brock, but a friend of mine did. And he\u2019d mail me clippings of the comic.  \n\nAnd I loved it!  It was hilarious, fun, subversive.  Potentially deep, or just messing with us\u2026 not sure.  And I don\u2019t care.  I loved it!\n\nDoes anyone recall this?  Have past copies of it?  Know who did it?  I\u2019d love to find and collect the old Blik comics!",

I have some papers in my portfolio but so far 1999/2000 don't have that comic in them. The best ones I remember from the 1999's was the UniCartoon by Kristy. Ended up having to reprint all the front pages because one comic offended one of the bars that was a big sponsor of the paper.",

It was quite a unique little comic with two bizarrely and simply drawn characters - the main being Blik - and they would have existential, absurd, silly conversations.  \n\nLike Waiting For Godot meets Beavis and Butthead\u2026 but way way more Godot.",

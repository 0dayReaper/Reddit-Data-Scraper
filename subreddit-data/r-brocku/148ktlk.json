    "postText": "Hi, for the first year of BBA, you need to take calculus. I didn't take calculus or do too well in my advanced functions. So to my seniors, any advice you can give?\n\nWould you recommend taking the pre-req that Brock provides or would a review over the summer do the trick?\n\nIf you have any advice or know anyone please comment, on course selections!",

Calculus I is by far the easiest since it\u2019s just basic fundamentals you learn but calculus II was by far the hardest (mainly because of my professor) but as long as you make yourself comfortable with doing integrals you should be fine.",

And I think 1P97 wouldn't be too hard if you do the regular homework so you can identify anything you don't quickly comprehend, and then practice those areas further while you still have time. There's also a gazillion calc videos online, I like 3Blue1Brown's 'Essence of Calculus' series in particular.",

All the assignments and exams for 1P97 are online so you can use your notes and it\u2019s not too hard to get a decent mark",

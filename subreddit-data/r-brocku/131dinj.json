    "postText": "Hi all Comp. Science majors out there, how was going through these two courses this year?  \nWere the assignments hard? What are the main respective area of interest for each? For example, on the Brock's website, it says that you need to be familiar with assembly (for 2p12), how \"familiar\" do you actually need to be?",

And note that this is my experience with Dr. Carvalho based on this semester.\n\n\nAssignments and quizzes were not hard. Prof is pretty lenient and fair with them. And is always willing to answer questions.\n\nAssembly is introduced in the course. You dont need to be very familiar with it. But reading up on it a little isn\u2019t a bad idea, so you\u2019re prepared.\n\nThe course mostly focuses on designing and understanding computer architecture using logic gates and circuits (nothing physical, just diagrams). You will use VHDL to design them. And some software (we used ModelSim) to simulate the designs.",

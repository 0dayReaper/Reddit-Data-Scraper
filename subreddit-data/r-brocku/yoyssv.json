Go to your \u201cmybrocku portal\u201d and on the left hand side click \u201cwithdrawl request\u201d. Click that and withdrawl from the class on that page. You will have to email finances to ask for some of your money back",

            "comment": "What a lot fail to mention is that not only do you not recieve money back, but you incur a financial penalty which typically is the cost of taking a singular course. This is typically applied at the end of the semester/a couple weeks after the withdrawal. Another thing is that withdrawing from a course counts as an attempt. Most courses only allow 2 attempts before having to contact academic advising, so just make sure you prioritize the course next time you take it",

            "comment": "i took it last spring, it was an asynchronous course so everything was at your own pace however there was group work. the two group assignments were weighted higher than the individual assignments (i believe there were 3 papers to write; 2 of them were short and 1 as a final paper). I found it pretty manageable but had some issues with the group work but that could be due to the lack of initiative from my group members. i have the syllabus, let me know if you want it !!",

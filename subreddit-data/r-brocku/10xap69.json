Great for seeing what\u2019s out there, but a bad opportunity to actually apply for work. There\u2019s just too many people, it\u2019s almost impossible to make an impression on anyone. \n\nI won\u2019t say you didn\u2019t miss anything, but I can say that you don\u2019t have any disadvantages for not going.",

My co-op will start on spring/summer 2024 so I could have guessed I wouldn\u2019t miss anything important since it can repeat. But most people I know is in business program and only my is public health so I was worried a bit.",

Any course with her is fulfilling as a student and doesn't feel like a salary padder like some instructors make courses feel like.  I've had 2P49 with a different instructor and the course was low workload, but if the grading scheme is the same, pay attention to the slides and make sure you are able to explain what you learn and you'll be fine. No experience with 3P21. Good luck!",

The constant struggle of not being able to g out with ppl cuz they make excuses or there\u2019s nothing to do here makes life more depressing. \n\nLet\u2019s not forget how everyone stares at each other like they\u2019re Hitler. Esp in thistle or the library.",

Now that I\u2019m in my fifth year, I\u2019ve realized that being lonely isn\u2019t always a bad thing. I\u2019ve made some friends over the years here and I don\u2019t even talk to some of them anymore. Most times when I\u2019m here on weekends I stay in and watch a movie and do laundry. The odd time I go out with friends I cherish it. But being lonely has made me a much stronger and healthier person. Since I\u2019m living away from my hometown while in uni, ive gone to therapy, broke old habits, become more independent, etc. It\u2019s honestly great. I\u2019ve even went out for a drink and dinner by myself before. I\u2019ve learned to enjoy the quiet and my own company, instead of relying on people to keep me busy and distract me. Of course having a couple friends to hangout with now and then is great, but trust me when I say that being alone is a skill that you really learn best in university. But also, I\u2019ve been through it where I feel down and depressed too, you\u2019re not alone in that!",

Here all I have are some acquaintances that I\u2019m friendly with. I love it. It\u2019s peaceful, I can, as you said, learn how to be on my own. I\u2019ve spent so much time with no one but myself, going to the gym, trying shrooms, many different things. \n\nI would\u2019ve liked to have had a group of friends here and all of that exciting stuff. However, I\u2019ll always cherish the calm and peace I\u2019ve been able to find here on my own as well.",

The amount of times I've ducked into the bathroom to make sure there's nothing on my face or clothes because people are staring so intensely at me is insane. This is my fifth year here at Brock and I've never noticed a staring issue before.\n\n\nMy only suggestion for making friends is talking to people in your seminars or joining a club or intramurals. I have found it extremely difficult to make friends here at Brock, but in my experience, even just having someone to sit with in class makes a big difference. I don't have a group of people to hang out with outside of school, but having one person who I can sit with in lecture/seminar and have basic chit-chat with really helped improve my mental health.",

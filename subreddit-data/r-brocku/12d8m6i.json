    "postText": "I am a first year student and just started at Brock in January. One of my professors mentioned the beginning of the term that you need a 40% on the exam to pass the course no matter what your average is. That is for an introductory computer course (APCO 1P01) which I am taking as an elective. Would this be the case for any of my other courses, or is that only for certain courses?",

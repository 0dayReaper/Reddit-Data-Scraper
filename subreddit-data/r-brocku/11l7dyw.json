    "postText": "Okay, so this is a little complicated.\n\nI currently am an \u201cundefined\u201d major, I\u2019m in the middle ground of switching from biochemistry to child and youth studies. This year I still have some left over biochem courses that don\u2019t do anything for my child and youth studies degree. Since I dropped some of my hard courses from biochem like physics, I just took two random electives to fill in my schedule one of them being pcul 2q91. There\u2019s only midterm exams and the expectations are unclear so I bombed my first of 3 midterm exams. The feedback on the essay was hardly helpful so I don\u2019t think I can improve on time for my next one tomorrow. \n\nMy question is, will me failing this class prevent me from getting into child and youth studies even though it\u2019s just an elective? I can\u2019t make an appointment with the academic advisor until march 23rd and dropping the class is not an option because I will be considered part time which will cut off my funding. I need advice on what to do from here if anything. Thanks",

So if you're going to apply those elective credits to the new major you'll need to get the minimum grade. If not, I personally don't see why you would need to? \n\nEither way, academic advising has walk-in hours I advise you use. I believe Tyesdays and Thursdays 1:30-3:30, but check the site to be double sure.",

I haven\u2019t even started taking the transfer credits yet so I most likely still have time to get a new elective. Thanks for the reply!",

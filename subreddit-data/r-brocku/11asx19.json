    "postText": "I submitted an essay on Monday for an english course, and I got 12% on my turnitin report which is the highest score ive ever gotten on an essay. I immediately started panicking and when I checked the report it highlight 3/4 sentences that were nearly identical to an online source Ive never seen before. (Also all the sentences marked come from the same source, so it makes it look even more suspicious)\n\nIs my prof going to think I plagiarized? I wrote the entire essay myself but it\u2019s extremely weird that turnitin picked up these sentences as plagiarism. Help lol",

            "comment": "The type of essay you are writing will drastically influence the amount of overlap turnitin locates in your writing. For example, an argumentative essay should have largely original content as it is a position that you are making the case for given different evidence. Explanatory/exegetical essays will have much more overlap with other sources since you are merely repeating and clarifying what has already been said by others. The amount of direct quotations will also affect this too. \n\nThat being said, you probably have nothing to worry about. If they even decide to check you for academic misconduct (which is extremely unlikely) they will conduct an interview and ask you to explain things. As long as you can explain why you wrote things and give clarification on your writing to ensure that you understand the content enough to have written it yourself, you will be fine.",

Turnitin has, at times, started flagging people for page numbers and commas, which obviously drastically increases plagiarized % scores. I'm sure you'll be completely fine.\n\nIf you're really worried about it though, email your professor and explain the situation. As long as you cited everything else correctly, I'm sure they'll be understanding.",

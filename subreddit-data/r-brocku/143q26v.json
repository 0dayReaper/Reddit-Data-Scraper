I stumbled upon OPER 4P26, I\u2019ve had the prof before and he\u2019s pretty chill and easy marker. Whoever has taken this course can you please help. I am open to any suggestions anyone has for easy Business Electives. Thanks in advance!",

Wrote my thoughts in this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/brocku/comments/13m68rk/review\\_of\\_itis\\_courses\\_bba\\_information\\_systems/](https://www.reddit.com/r/brocku/comments/13m68rk/review_of_itis_courses_bba_information_systems/)\n\nSyllabus is linked in that thread too. Basically it's OPER 2P91 Part II, very similar feel. Project wasn't hard, cheat sheet for the exam. I got a 90 (though I was a bit of a try-hard in the class if I'm honest xD). I enjoyed the material, class felt a bit dry generally.",

The other classes I took were ITIS, but the ones I liked most were not easy, and the ones that were easy I did not like, haha. Details on those are in that same thread I linked.",

    "postText": "I took my first year French at Mac and it\u2019s been two years since I\u2019ve taken the course. I heard French was easier at Brock and I thought I\u2019d get back into since I\u2019m in con ed and it would help me when looking for a job. I took French immersion all throughout elementary and hs. I was wondering if this course was hard. Or profs I should look out for and the work load.",

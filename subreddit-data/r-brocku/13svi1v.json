    "postText": "Hey so I live in Brampton and I might be going to brock starting september 2023. I was wondering if a GO train goes from St.Catharines to stations like bramalea GO or mount pleasant GO. \n\nOnline it shows that a train goes to union station from St.Catharines then another from union station to Brampton, but that takes like almost 3 hours.\n\nA brock student was telling me that they opened up new lines this year and I was wondering if there is a faster way to get to Brampton from St.Catharines?\n(just wanna go back home for the weekends lol)",

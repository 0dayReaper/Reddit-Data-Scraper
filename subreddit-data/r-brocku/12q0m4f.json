            "comment": "I've taken CHYS 3P35 and 3P65. Both classes are taught by Danny Tarulli if you are lucky. I really enjoyed his classes. He definitely is more of a lecturer, rather than engaging through discussion questions. But with that, he offers lots of insight. His courses are set up exactly the same, so if you take one in fall, and another in winter, you're not having to get used to a new course set up and requirements. I really enjoyed this part. Both classes have take home exams that he provides well in advance. There are only 3 assignments throughout the course, mid term take home, term paper, and final take home. He will also point out during lectures what appears on the exams which I always noted and came back to when writing my exams. Overall, you can't go wrong if you take either of these and go to class, he is a generous marker and you could easily bump up your average if you take either of these.",

            "comment": "CHYS 3V55 was fully online but very science based - assignments were easy but exam was tough. \n\nI second what the other commenter said, I took 3P65 with Danny and it was an easy 90. I only went to a few lectures since they were 3 hours long and he rambles quite a bit, but the assignments and take home exams were super easy and he posts all the slides! 20% of your mark comes from \u201cparticipation assignments\u201d where you write 3-5 sentences on the weekly reading. These aren\u2019t graded on content, simply just for completion!",

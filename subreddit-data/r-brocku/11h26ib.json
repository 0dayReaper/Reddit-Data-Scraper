    "postText": " \n\nHey, I am yet to be a transfer student at Brock. I'm currently majoring in computer science, so I will be joining in my second year. I have the option to take the course in co-op. My questions are:\n\n1: How is the co-op in Brock beneficial for computer science students?\n\n2: Will it be easy to get a Job/internship if I'm a dedicated student?\n\n3: Do all students who register for co-op get jobs? Does the university prioritize every co-op student?\n\n4: What are the cons of the co-op program at Brock that the university doesn't share on the website?\n\nAny computer science student who has gone through co-op, please respond as I'm in need of your help...",

You\u2019ll likely have a hard time getting interviews for the first while. As your search goes on it gets easier.\n\n3. Allegedly that\u2019s pretty much the case.\n\n4. Brock makes you do A LOT of useless stuff before and during co-ops. You have to take an extra course that gives advice that is bad, then submit a resume (which you\u2019ve already done as part of the course. Unfortunately the way they want you to do it in the course is not something the program you submit to will like) along with some other stuff before you can view the job board. Then during your search the talent coaches expect you to give them regular updates about your search. Once you finally have a job you have to do a bunch of questionnaires and book a check in meeting over the course of your term.\n\n\nAll in all co-ops are well worth it assuming your placement is good. What you learn is much more valuable than anything you could in a classroom. I would HIGHLY recommend brushing up on a few different languages before your search though. Brock does not prepare you well for many placements especially not for your first one. If you know a few language for different things it should help.",

    "postText": "Hi, during the spring/summer registration I always see courses that are project based courses. From what I understand, you develop a study/project either alone or with a group. But I wanna talk to someone that has already taken a class like this before. I just wanna know the dynamic of the class and the type of assignments given, etc. + are these types of classes open to everyone or do I need to be in the research/comprehensive stream?",

No medicals needed from my country.\n\nStill waiting. I've seen a considerably delay for this fall, just a few studypermits granted searching in groups from FB and instagram.. I think this seasons (fall2023) after covid has brought a lot of work to IRCC, and that 7 weeks processing times is not accurate. I hope all of us  have good news soon.",

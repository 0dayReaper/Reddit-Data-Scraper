I get it\u2019s technically not the university\u2019s problem but is this being considered? This could be a big unnecessary financial strain for some students.",

                            "comment": "I think this is definitely a consideration, but I would also say that student representation has been advocating for a return to as normal as possible activities. Students really want and need to be back on campus for a variety of reasons (research, social, financial, etc.) and while there are very legitimate concerns, we need to have a preliminary version of the timetable up so that people can plan their courses and find leases if they need to.\n\nIt\u2019s a very cloudy crystal ball right now, and I think everyone is trying to strike the right balance. Vaccinations look to be ramping up, which is helping everyone\u2019s confidence level as well. \n\nPlease keep in mind, the timetable is Fall *and* Winter. Even if we are forced to reduce campus activities in the fall, the hope would be to return in January. Ideally that doesn\u2019t leave too many people on the hook for leases they don\u2019t need.\n\nFor Residence, the university did grant pro-rated refunds for everyone living on campus in 2020 who had to move out early. I think that was the right thing to do, and I doubt most landlords did that. \n\nI\u2019ve attached an image that the federal government shared. I\u2019m sure our planning committees have way more information than this, but this does a good job showing where we hope to be in fall.  https://i.imgur.com/oZ8AT1C.jpg",

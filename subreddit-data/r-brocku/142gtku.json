    "postText": "Okay so basically I graduated high school last year took a gap cause I change the major I wanted anyways long story short I had lots of family issues and eventually it\u2019s now June I ended up forgetting to reapply right away I applied to brock commerce like 5 days ago and currently take one of my high school credits with open school Ontario. \n\nBiggest issue is that now I got a email from brock saying that commerce is now full for September what do I do? \ud83d\ude2d I applied to Brock accounting rn as it\u2019s open but my high school average is mid 80\u2019s and coop is high 80\u2019s\u2026.. so my question is what average did people get in with and if I don\u2019t get coop can I do good in my first year in the program to get coop? \n\n\nI\u2019ve been bawling my eyes out because my parents are absolutely gonna kill me cause I screwed up applications",

You are already supposed to have a non-credit co-op preparation course in second semester of your first year. And just for context, despite my Sport Management tag, I am a BBA Co-op grad. I was accepted into Accounting Co-op and switched to BBA Co-op after my first semester",

If all else fails, I think OP should talk to an academic advisor. Because there is people who lose the ability to be in co-op because they have less than a 70% average",

I started in General Humanities, and did the pre-requisite courses of BBA (commerce, to use OP's term). The pre-reqs are required to transfer into BBA, which are ECON 1P91, ECON 1P92, MATH 1P98 and MATH 1P97. All of these pre-reqs are open to Gen. Humanities students (and basically everyone).",

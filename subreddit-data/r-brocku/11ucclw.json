            "comment": "1P03 focuses on concepts that are independent of 1P02 in my opinion - 1P02 is all about what Java is, but 1P03 is more about how to make Java better. 1P03 focuses a lot on arrays, linked lists, stacks, algorithmic design, abstract data types, software design principles etc. \n\nAs long as you can understand how Java works at a syntactic level (control flow, loops, error handling, etc.) you should be fine. Having a good command of Java is important, though, as all your assignments are gonna rely on taking a large, abstract specification, and narrowing it to what is required for proper spec.",

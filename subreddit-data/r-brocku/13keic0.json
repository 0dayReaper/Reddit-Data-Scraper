I'd make it a goal to be in Canada for the 1st of September, justto give yourself a few days to get your legs under you. \nLast year, things kicked off on Monday, Sept 5th, with classes starting Sept 7th. \nMost rental periods also start at the first of the month, but I have no idea what your living situation will be. Rules might be different if you are staying in the school residences\n\nHope that info helps!",

So classes would start on the 6th and, move in date is either 2nd or 3rd as assigned in August. (If you are staying in residence).\n\nIn terms of orientation, keep an eye out on ExperienceBU and  https://discover.brocku.ca/campus-events/",

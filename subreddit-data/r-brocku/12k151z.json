You have to do 2, and they\u2019re based off the three I\u2019s in the course (institutions, ideologies, and interests). You need to show what you learned from the course. The questions are very broad. You need a intro with a thesis, 3 arguments, and conclusion for both questions. If you do a counter argument (you don\u2019t need one,) you need to say why it\u2019s not convincing",

For instance, for the first question on institutions you would need to study weeks 2-6. For the second question on ideas, study weeks 7-9, and for the 3rd question on interests, study weeks 10-12",

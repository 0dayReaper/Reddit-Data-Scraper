            "comment": "The year I took it (I'm currently in fourth year), the average for our midterm exam was 42%. The average for the three years before that was about the same. Also, there was a pretty large (for first year) research paper we had to write that a lot of people struggled with. There really wasn't much work outside of that, other than prepping for seminar (straightforward, not hard) and a few quizzes (not hard). COVID happened at the end of my first year so we didn't do a final exam. \n\nI don't know if they've changed the structure, but a lot of people did struggle with it. They go in expecting lots of fun, and there is, but they don't expect hard to grasp concepts, and think psych is so easy that they don't need to study (hence the 42% average for the midterm!). \n\nI think if you *read the damn text* and take time to study, and understand that grasping a concept means you can easily apply it across different situations and not just define it, you'll be just fine.",

If you spend time shoving them all into your brain with examples, you should be more than fine. This was how it was when I took it many years ago. Tools like Anki or quizlet with spaced repitition are key to success in the course. The reason why most students do poorly is because psychology is like common sense with an explanation lol. So they think their own simple understanding of it will get them through. This is further from the truth since you need to be technical. If you go to class, take notes, make cards to review and actually do it from beginning to end, you will do extremely well. I don\u2019t just talk out of my ass. I remember getting a 65 on the midterm and pulled through finishing with an 86 because I absolutely crushed everything else going forward.\n\nAs an example, role strain and role conflict are two similar concepts but they\u2019re different. You need to know what that difference is. Examples you can draw from are helpful to assist you in sorting this out. These are the kind of minute things that matter is basically all psych courses",

It\u2019s not as subjective as people think but it definitely is passable. If you give decent effort you\u2019ll get atleast a 75. If your really into it 80+ is attainable",

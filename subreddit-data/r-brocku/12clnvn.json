            "comment": "hi, best residence to pick is usually up to you and your preferences, however i live in village and really enjoy it. \n\nvillage is the townhouse style residence on the south side of campus. there are 3 single rooms and one double room, with 2 shared bathrooms and a kitchen. cleanliness depends on you and your housemates cleaning, but in my experience it's very clean and i've seen like maybe 2 spiders this whole year. i feel it's also more private than traditional res, my friends say they can hear everything from the people around them but i rarely hear my housemates, sound proofing is good.\n\nAs for the overnight guest policy, residence staff require you to sign your guest in 24 hours before, and you only get a set number of nights per month, can't have guests certain weeks, etc. now here is where village rocks. there's no front desk or staff in the houses, so *nobody can stop you from just having him over whenever.* I don't think anyone in my house has ever signed in a guest properly, there just isn't the same inforcement.\n\nI'd reccomend you search for residence suggestions in this sub to see other opinions, but i see village shit on a lot by everyone and i just wanted to make my case for why it's great.",

            "comment": "For a single room, cleanliness and privacy I would highly recommend one of the semi suite options. Probably Res 8 or Earp. \n\nIn terms of guest policy, technically you can only have someone over for 3 nights in a row for a maximum of 6 nights a month. But there is nothing stopping you from just having someone over since there\u2019s no checks or anything",

They have been checking recently; myself and a friend have gotten a ticket in the past month. To my knowledge they don\u2019t usually check overnight parking and even if they do it\u2019s like $5",

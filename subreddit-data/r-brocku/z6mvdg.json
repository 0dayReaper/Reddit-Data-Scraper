    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a first year student and I was originally going to brock for biochemistry. My mark was suffering and I decided I hated it so I dropped some of the courses lowering my average. My end goal is to apply to the primary/junior level consecutive education after I get an undergraduate degree, and it says the recommend one to have was child and youth studies. I don\u2019t know much about switching majors, but I know that the courses needed for these two are wildly different and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to switch because the courses are so different. Has anyone else had to make a drastic change in majors like this that can help me out?",

            "comment": "If you're looking for p/j, you might as well do concurrent rather than consecutive. The benefit is that you get teacher Ed courses starting in year three, vs year 5. \nDefinitely book in with the Faculty of Education academic advising. You can book appointments though my.brocku.ca. they also have drop in hours for their on campus office",

The chances of me getting into concurrent are little to none according to them since I can\u2019t take any of their year round courses anymore, and I can\u2019t take the year 1 courses next year because I\u2019ll be too far behind. They recommended I do consecutive as a result",

Concurrent seems pretty strict with their requirements/application window. It seems like every-time I talk to an advisor about switching from biochem to another major it\u2019s just instantly \u201cno you can\u2019t\u201d",

I'm in ConEd so not sure about CHYS requirements. \nI am assuming you wouldn't be able to transfer from 1st year Biochem into 1st CHYS/ConEd at all because the courses don't align. Chances are the courses you've taken might be able to be used as elective/science credit. Definitely talk to someone about starting from year one of CHYS/ConEd. \nConEd requirements are definitely more strict as it is an honours program. You must maintain a 70 average",

I really hate biochem and I struggle heavily so I don\u2019t reach the minimum 70 requirement for con ed. that\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping I can get my undergrad in CHYS to help boost my chances of getting accept into Consecutive education.

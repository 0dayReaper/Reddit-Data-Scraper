    "postText": "As most of us probably received an email in the last few weeks advising us to order our textbooks for the winter semester, there\u2019s a few sites (all of which I\u2019ve used) that have copies of the textbooks on hand that you download onto your computer.\n\nhttp://libgen.lc\nI\u2019ve used this for the past 2 years and has worked wonders for me.\n\nhttps://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks\nI have had a few friends in various STEM courses who have used this, some successfully, some not!\n\nhttps://openstax.org\nAnother resource I\u2019ve used, both in high school and now. \n\n\n\nHopefully this will help and save you some coin!\n\n\nEDIT:\nFirstly I gotta say thank you to the people who\u2019ve reached out to thank me or have given awards. I really appreciate it. \n\nSecondly there\u2019s some concern over the legality, and the consequences if you\u2019re caught. Brock can do nothing when it comes to something like this. WORST CASE scenario is if one of these websites doesn\u2019t have the updated textbook, you might miss something that is placed in the new textbook. I haven\u2019t run into that problem yet though :)\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to cover your bases, you can call the Brock Library and you can be loaned the textbook for free for a few hours to get that information you might\u2019ve missed.",

I don\u2019t thinks it\u2019s fair to charge hundreds of dollars for a book when I\u2019m already paying thousands for school. On top of that 95% of the books a prof requires you to buy for the course are written by them, which means they are making monkey off of it, which I think is slightly unethical.",

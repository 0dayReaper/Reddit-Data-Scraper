They\u2018ll drop hints for the final all the time and only mention things in class that will be on the final. \nIt\u2019s the rarest case that not going to class will still make you excel in any class in university.",

The textbook for more or less every single class (especially in early years) will have everything that you need to get an A+ if you have enough discipline to actually read and understand it. Not everyone learns best in lectures - some would benefit a lot from just skipping and reading.",

Also, if you could specify the course/class name that would make things easier. Any help/advice would be appreciated.",

If you apply yourself and ask questions when you are unsure and make an active effort to understand the content you are being taught, you'll be fine in any class. The primary language at Brock is Java, though there are a number of classes that will use other languages (C++, HTML/JS etc). For the first ~2 years or so, every class will require your assignments to be in Java unless its one that specifically uses a different language, but after that it mostly becomes \"so long as it will run on the lab machines so we can mark it, do whatever\"",

The overall goal is to teach you concepts of how programming works (though there are certain concepts that are language specific). \n\n\nAny of the earlier courses that requires you to learn something other than Java typically will give a brief introduction of anything that out should know. \n\n\nCOSC 2P95 is basically intro to c++ (recommend this one highly, good course and a good language to know)\n\nCOSC 2P89 is web development and crash courses you on like six languages during the semester (HTML, CSS, JS, Mongo, PHP, Python). Not a bad course by any means but also not very in depth given how much it tries to cover.\n\nCOSC 2P05 used to go over python but has since been redesigned to be more of a \u201chistory of\u201d class.\n\nLater on (like 3PXX+ courses) if a class says we will be using &lt;language&gt;, the assumption is that you know enough about it or are willing to teach yourself it in order to take it, as they are going to teach concepts that don\u2019t leave room for basics in the curriculum (COSC 3P98 is a great example, also highly recommend)\n\nHope that helps some :)",

Thank you for taking time out of your day to answer my questions :D\n\nJust to be clear- what does COSC 3P98 (the last one you mentioned) actually deal with? I'm a little lost there. Does it like change often? (the language used)\nAnd would you recommend taking all of the classes you mentioned?  I'll be sure to make a note of them all and try to enroll in them!\n\nAlso, one more thing that I'm curious about is the co-op at Brock. Is it good? Do people get enough opportunities? Have you had any experience with it? Also are there opportunities for extracurriculars? And how are job prospects like after graduation?\n\nI'd really like to hear your thoughts on this. Again, thank you so much for helping me out!",

Was probably one of my favourite courses at Brock, so definitely recommend. The other as well, good general knowledge to have and looks nice on a resume ;).\n\nWould 100% recommend the co op stream at Brock. Dealing with the office can be a pain but the work terms are definitely worth the headache. I did 4 work terms (minimum 3, max 5) and was worth the extra effort for the work experience. Comp Sci job market is healthy with tons of opportunities almost anywhere \n\nPlenty of opportunities for extra curricular stuff, pick your poison really and Brock likely offers it.",

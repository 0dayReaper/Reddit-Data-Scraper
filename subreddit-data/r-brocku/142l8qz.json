            "comment": "The program is not what you expect! This program is different from other MSc programs because it focuses primarily on managerial finance. The MSc in accounting is very similar to this program. I was disappointed when I started my course selection. The program offers attractive electives but they don\u2019t offer them. I wanted to learn numerical methods (which is extremely useful) but the program no longer offered it. You rarely would work with capital markets structures and financial derivatives. That being said, the program should not be considered as equal to other finance programs that can teach you these attractive skills. You won\u2019t be able to compete with other MSc candidates for your phd admissions because you will be missing those skills. I personally found it very difficult to land a phd and opted for industry instead. I would recommend looking into other programs that fit your interest. Good luck!",

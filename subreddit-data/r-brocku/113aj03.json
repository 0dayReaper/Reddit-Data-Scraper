It was also a fall winter as opposed to spring summer, so it could be different in the summer. For comm, there was 2-3 hours of lectures to watch + 3-4 readings + a forum post every week. On top of that there were 2 major assignments in the middle and at the end of the course. On top of all the other course work I had it felt like far too much. For geog there was maybe an hour and a half of videos per week plus a written assignment every two weeks and a final assignment. It was significantly less work",

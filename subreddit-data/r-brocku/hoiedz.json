ASYNC/Asynchronous courses do not require that you attend at a specific time but will still have deadlines that you will need to adhere to.\n\nYou are able to pick any day and any time when it\u2019s an ASYNC course, with SYNC you cannot.\n\n**What are credits?**\n\nCredits are just classes, a 1FXX class would be 1 credit and would generally take place over two semesters, a 1PXX class would be 0.5 credits. Most programs require 20 credits for graduation. Every class is 0.5 credits unless they're 1FXX.\n\n**Residences:**\n\nAs of right now, residences are open for application and in-person courses are planned for Winter.\n\n**BrockU Student Run Clubs:**\n\n[https://experiencebu.brocku.ca/organizations](https://experiencebu.brocku.ca/organizations)\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/brocku/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/brocku/wiki/index)\n\nPlease add in comments if there's anything you think I should add and feel free to post comments/questions about anything.",

Does anyone know if this applies if you were granted more than 3 but arent using that many? I was given 5.0 from college but turns out I will only be using 1.0 this year. Don't think the advisor will be replying to my email in time if I'm to register the 13th.",

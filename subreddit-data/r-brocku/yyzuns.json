I couldn\u2019t find the syllabus online, so I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s exam heavy or more assignment based? If anyone has taken this course before, information would be appreciated!",

The exams themselves were also pretty easy, I found that most times I didn't even need the cheatsheet, even without intense studying. \n\nThe other 15% of the grade was 3 lecture reports. Basically just show up to class and she'll randomly choose lectures to make you submit your lecture notes of. Overall it was a super easy course, I ended up with like a ~95% without much effort.",

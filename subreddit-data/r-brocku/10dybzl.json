You wouldn't be able to take all the required courses for your degree online since there's so few options. There are some courses here and there that are online if that's what you are looking for instead. You can find them by going to the Brock timetable and scrolling through the options and look for classes that say \"ASYNC\" or \"SYNC\"",

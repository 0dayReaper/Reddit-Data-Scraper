            "comment": "What are your thoughts on the current progress of anti cancer drugs? If we look at metal-based vs organic based. It seems to get complicated as one is typically not synthetically heavy meaning the cost is quite low for example cisplatin is rough $5 per 50mg. However organic anti cancer drugs such as pembrolizumab costs $46.54 per mg! However, there\u2019s a problem with cellular resistance, harsh side effects, and drugs like cisplatin can react with sulfur bearing bio molecules. There\u2019s obviously been the push (which we all know I\u2019m rambling) in the realm of Pt(IV) prodrugs, but many have been stopped in clinical trials or are still underway. But, their efficacy seems to only match cisplatin and cisplatin-based approved drugs (oxali- and carboplatin). Then comes the emergence of Ru based drugs which have these interesting properties of both early and late transition metals. We\u2019ve all seen these reports on the development of half-sandwich arene, tetrapyrrole, and polypyridyl Ru complexes. But, those haven\u2019t made it far in clinical trials. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re asking \u201cwhat about the photoactivatable metal complexes?\u201d Well there\u2019s some interesting trans-Pt azide species for sure and then there\u2019s what\u2019s been done with Ru photosensitizers. Obviously the greatest problem I\u2019d finding species that absorb in that biological optical window of 600-900nm. But, that\u2019s easier said than done. Don\u2019t get me started on dark stability too. Anyways my second question is, if I want 20-plus inch pythons like Arnold, should I be integrating bicep workouts frequently in exercise routines or should I maybe have two direct days at the start and end of a week where all I focus on is bicep curls?",

                    "comment": "I knew something was amiss once I saw the username XD \n\nTo answer the real question, optimizing muscle hypertrophy, especially in the upper arm is a difficult feat. Trying to grow the arms is a combination of biomechanics, metabolism, muscle physiology and more so I\u2019ll try to give more in-depth along with a short answer.\n\nFirst thing I\u2019d question is what your workout structure currently looks like. If your structure is very strength/power-based, implementation of bicep exercises may be easier, as the total amount of recruitment already being done by the bicep is not as high. If your workout is hypertrophy focused, you might already be doing substantial amounts of work on the bicep, so the amount of work directed specifically to the bicep may not need to be that high. \n\nThe number of days per week you work out also implicates whether you will want to split bicep work into separate days, as increasing the number of workouts per week decreases muscle and CNS recovery time. Although you may adequate space out the muscle recovery, the CNS can take up to 2 days to fully recover depending on the work (strength programs typically require more rest).\n\nAlso have to factor how exercise selection and order affects hypertrophy. Rows tends to recruit the bicep as a stabilizer, so you will see some usage during this and other similar exercises. Order is also important as exercises performed towards the beginning of a workout typically see the best gains, but isolation exercises before compound ones typically results in lower performance on compound lifts. This is mainly due to both failure within the CNS and fatigue of the muscle.\n\nOutside of that, you should hit bicep exercises that hit the different heads as well as training in a lengthened and shortened positions. Lengthened position tends to promote more gains but using a variety of positions ensures optimal usage along with exposure to different resistance angles.\n\nMetabolism-wise, if your diet is off, nothing you do will matter long-term. Given I don\u2019t know your current workout plans, you should be looking in the ballpark of 1-1.2g protein/kg of body weight at minimum. That will promote and maintain more optimal levels muscle protein synthesis and aid in recovery efforts. \n\nOverall, setting aside a day specifically for the accessory muscles may be more benefit if that\u2019s what you\u2019re specifically targeting. Literature is a bit all over the place, but ~10-12 sets of direct bicep exercises/week is probably what I\u2019d aim for (max 16 sets), although ~8 sets/week can be substantial enough depending on your other exercises/or if your current workout plan is hypertrophy focused. The tricep makes up more of the upper arm, so it may be more beneficial to ensure adequate work of both muscle groups.\n\nTL;DR: if compound lifts are strength/power oriented, you can incorporate bicep work earlier as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with the compound lifts if bicep growth is your main focus rn. If it does interfere, having a separate day for arms may be of more benefit and less taxing on your system, although you\u2019ll need to effectively space out workouts for both muscle and CNS reasons. If your workouts are hypertrophy focused, you might be doing enough bicep work that a seperate day isn\u2019t necessary and that the remaining bicep work can be included throughout the week. Just make sure to get your rest in, train in both lengthened and shortened positions, and eat adequate protein either way.",

                    "comment": "First off, congrats on applying! What area of kinesiology are you hoping to get into/what supervisor are you hoping to pair with?\n\nAs for what I wish I knew, there\u2019s a couple things, all mostly from personal experiences:\n\nTime Management - your time management skills are going to be heavily tested. Whatever time you would\u2019ve allowed yourself in undergrad towards a task, increase that by 1.5-2x. There\u2019s been many times where things get delayed or postponed or suddenly expedited, so you\u2019ll have to be flexible and comfortable working on things in small bursts.\n\nAtmosphere and Environment - It may seem daunting at first as you\u2019ll be exposed to a variety of individuals with varying degrees of experience, but for the most part, everyone in the program is actually quite relaxed. In Cairns (where I\u2019m at), we have a dedicated office space where for the most part, the pods are a nice area to relax and get to know others. The labs across Brock have the same chill vibe to it for the most part, just differs slightly.\n\nProfs - Even though this is a step up from undergrad, profs want to see you succeed. This year, I had numerous events occur that delayed assignments, presentations and more. Most profs are pretty lenient with extensions within reason, so if you need an extra day to finish something, ask about it early and it\u2019ll most likely be accepted. The courses also tend to move away from traditional, regurgitating facts back (except for a couple courses) kind of learning towards more applied and discussion based learning. It\u2019s up to you to figure out how much time and emphasis to put into these courses, but these courses tend to be easier comparatively imo\n\nCourse selection - this has a huge impact on your development going forward and who you collaborate/correspond with. You\u2019ll pick courses under guidance from your supervisor, but if you\u2019re particularly interested in a specific subject, or think that a specific course will help you professionally, take it! Most courses outside of stats and 5N01 are small (4-18 people), so it\u2019s a great way to build connections to other profs/researchers. \n\nComparison is the thief of joy - working in a lab setting, it\u2019s very easy to compare your work/your lab\u2019s work to other labs, leading to dissatisfaction in yourself. You might join a lab with no projects on the go whereas you might join one in the midst of one. If your lab isn\u2019t doing anything, ask to see if there\u2019s labs you could observe or receive some mentorship from. The more you end up comparing yourself to others, the deeper the hole you have to dig yourself out from.",

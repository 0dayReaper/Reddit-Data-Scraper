From what I remember, the first semester final project was a few choices. I analyzed early maps/cartography. Second semester final assignment was an essay about the book \u201cWhat the Oceans Remember\u201d. I didn\u2019t enjoy the fact that you would lose marks for \u201clate\u201d\nforum posts if they were in a day or two before the deadline, because they \u201cweren\u2019t early enough to generate discussion\u201d. Other than that, it was relatively enjoyable and easy enough if you\u2019re a history student.",

It's not an easy course but not necessarily \"hard\" either. The fact that the content is interesting (and far more relevant than many other history courses) makes it worth doing, imo. The design and structure of the course utilizes modern adult education theory quite impressively. If you're wondering, I got an A.",

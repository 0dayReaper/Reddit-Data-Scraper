Some classes, such as some courses for the required science credit, will be asynchronous online so it may not feel as heavy \u2014 at least it did not for me.\n\nI work a part time job on the side as a full time student, it is very manageable and profs that teach POLI courses (which is what most of your courses will be) are very kind and usually grand extensions for reasonable issues.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to PM me!",

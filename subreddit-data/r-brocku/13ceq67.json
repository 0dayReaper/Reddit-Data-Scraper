Searching on indeed can help you identify the jobs. This may influence your decision to choose this route.",

Which HLSC classes from the ones we can pick did you choose and how did you like them? And finally what electives did you take and how did you like them?",

There were 2 mandatory courses that i think you should definitely put the most attention towards: HLSC 2P07 and HLSC 2P49. HLSC 2P07 is Biostatistics and you will learn that there is much controversy with the course instructor (take a look at the rate my professor and you\u2019ll know what i\u2019m talking about\ud83d\ude02). Definitely try and stay on top of that course and understand the content.. you will need to take HLSC 3P07 as well in third year, which is the continuation of the course \ud83d\ude02 HLSC 2P49 has had different instructors, and the one I had was very challenging , so definitely stay on top of that course as well!  For the HLSC courses i took, i chose to do HLSC 2P50 and HLSC 2P90. Both have excellent professors and i am continuing to take their courses now. I have a minor in psychology so I also took PSYC 2P15 and PSYC 2P92 which are also excellent courses of your interested in doing a minor!",

You can really do a lot of things in education with a public health degree, think anything healthwise for prevention - injury prevention, physiotherapy, stuff like that, or work for public health!",

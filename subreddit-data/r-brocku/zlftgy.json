    "postText": "I am in my last year of BBA (business administration) and need one final non-major, non-business elective for next semester. I can\u2019t take any more 1P classes as i\u2019m maxed out at 8 credits there, so I need a 2P or above. \n\nSomething not too hard or consuming. Online would be great but I know it doesn\u2019t always work out that way and I can\u2019t find many, preferably without a high attendance mark too, not trying to be a perfect student in a last elective. \n\nI was originally going to do an INDG course but it has a big final project and like 30% attendance so I dropped it. \n\nany suggestions?",

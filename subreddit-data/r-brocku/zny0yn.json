Disadvantage was that you basically either got perfect on each question or 0. (questions were worth between 5-9 marks)\n\nIf you are in person, I'd practice as much questions as you can. If you have Hoover, he seemed to take exam questions right from the textbook. Also make sure you know how to rearrange the formulas in case you have to solve for a different variable.\n\nIf there is MC, those basically come straight from the textbook too.",

    "postText": "So, I saw there are a bunch of Marker/Grader positions up on the Brock Workday site for courses I've taken in the past. There's about 5 courses in total that I'm interested in and they're all in the same department and have the same contact. For people who have applied in the past, did you apply separately for each course posting? Or is it ok to just apply to one posting and indicate all the courses you're interested in? I tried emailing the contact listed in the posting to ask what to do but they haven't replied yet so I figured I'd ask here too. Thanks!",

Keep in mind however that assuming you are an undergrad, you are competing with graduate students and other undergraduates for the same position. The hiring process tends to prioritize grad students first, then undergraduates. However, some profs may have preferred students to fill the roles, but it's always worth a shot.",

The Winter term will now end on April 9. Exams will take place from April 13 to 23. The exam period for the Winter term will be shortened by two days, but every effort will be made to avoid undue burden on students. The Spring/Summer term will start as scheduled and the dates for Reading Week will also remain the same.",

    "postText": "I'm looking into becoming a French teacher for intermediate/seniors, and I'm trying to figure out how good my chances are at Brock. I'm actually a 105 student since I took a gap year after HS, but my top 6 accumulated to a 90.5%. On OUAC, it say I need low to mid 80s, but honestly, I have 0 experience teaching which might hurt my supplementals. With this info, does anyone know how my chances look? Is this good enough as a safety application?",

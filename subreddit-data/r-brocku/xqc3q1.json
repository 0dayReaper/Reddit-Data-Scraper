            "comment": "Yes you can bring what you\u2019d normally bring to school. They have proctors in the midterm/exam who walk around ensuring everyone\u2019s eyes are on their own page and they have nothing out that they shouldn\u2019t. You will usually only be allowed to have a pencil, eraser, and calculator on your desk. Everything else (including your phone and water and bag) has to stay under your desk/chair, or they might ask you to put it at the front of the room. It seems intense and scary with all the rules but it really is just a test. They take academic integrity very seriously (as they should). Just do your best to prepare and you\u2019ll be fine!",

            "comment": "Yes, you can but once you enter the test room place your backpack at the front or back of the room. The invigilators will be giving you instructions as you walk in and will let you know where to put it. Also, make sure nothing valuable like cash is in your backpack incase a student mistakenly takes it. \n\nBring pencils, pens, eraser, a sharpener or lead if you use a mechanical pencil (you can have those items on your desk or in a pencil case on the floor beside your chair). You can also have a water bottle but it can't be on the desk, so leave it on the floor beside your chair. \n\nTry to get enough sleep the night before and best of luck!!!",

            "comment": "TA for a couple courses here. Profs will typically let you know beforehand what you can bring in. Always bring a mix of pens and pencils just in case. If you\u2019re going to bring something to drink, make sure it\u2019s not noisy or if a standard water bottle, no label. Most profs won\u2019t have extra pens/pencils, or if they do, extremely limited amounts. If you need a calculator for the exam, make sure it\u2019s working beforehand (powers on and off, in the right mode, etc.). Other than that, keep everything in your bag and nothing in your pockets. \n\nPacing of the test is important. Depending on total time you\u2019re allowed, I would typically allocate 1 min per M/C, and 1.5 minutes for each mark the short answer/long question is worth. ALWAYS go through your booklet to make sure each question is answered, it\u2019s common that questions on the last page may be missed. Always tackle the questions worth more points first, as they tend to be on more general concepts. \n\nFeel free to ask questions if you\u2019re unsure about the wording of the question. We would much rather see you ask a question (and us either say we can\u2019t answer that or reword if necessary) than you attempt to assume the direction. We\u2019re instructed on how much we can say, so asking to clarify isn\u2019t a bad thing.\n\nIf you\u2019re a nervous tester, I recommend sitting towards the front so you can\u2019t see how many people are left writing. And remember to breathe, it\u2019s easy to become frantic in the last few minutes but clarity of writing is much better than throwing everything on the page",

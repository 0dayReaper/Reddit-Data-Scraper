A lot of these courses are set up in a sense that you need the background knowledge to get a firm grasp of the new content from the get-go. Without said knowledge, you\u2019ll probably struggle to get the concepts and be able to apply the knowledge. Though somewhat unlikely, there\u2019s probably a good chance that as long as you were close to the cut-off that you\u2019ll get selected for the course (within ~2%). If you were more than 5% off, it\u2019ll be much more difficult to prove you have the background necessary for the course, and at that point, you may be better off retaking the course. If it\u2019s your final year, you may be able to reason with the prof the necessity of you completing the course, but don\u2019t bank on it happening.",

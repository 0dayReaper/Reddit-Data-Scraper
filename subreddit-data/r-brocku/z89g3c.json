Thanks!",

The main distinction is BSc Kin students have to take physics and calculus in first year, BKin students don't. Otherwise, it mostly depends on what you want to do post-graduation. If you're thinking of going into research or med school, a science degree might look better on applications. If you're looking into a more practical side (think athletic therapy, personal trainer, etc.), I'd suggest the BKin. If you already know you'd like to do a master's degree, apply for the AIM degree and save the additional applications later (although I'm not sure the details on AIM so don't quote me!)",

            "comment": "Graduate of the BKin program, now in MSc AHS-Kin program here\n\nAs others have said, there\u2019s not much difference between BKin and BScKin. Mainly more math and physics based courses which could be beneficial for upper year courses (clinical biomechanics especially), but generally limits what electives you can take and the schedule is a bit more strict with pre-requisite courses. Other than that, the programs are pretty similar in mandatory courses. If you\u2019re thinking physio is what you want to do post-undergrad. I would lean more towards BKin as BScKin leans more towards a MSc Kin, and is generally less of a headache for first year students. \n\nThis may help with envisioning what to expect: https://brocku.ca/webcal/2022/undergrad/kine.html\n\nThe Masters of Professional Kin is a 1 year course that may help establish what fields you\u2019re considering to go into and can help strengthen applications for physio, but know that program choice for applying to it tends to have less of an effect overall. The program may put you a leg up over others for further education but do note that multiple assessments typically will go into your application for physio. Physio is a extremely competitive postgrad, with the average being around 6-7/100.",

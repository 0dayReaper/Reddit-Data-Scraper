    "postText": "I can\u2019t understand anything Earl Foxwell teaches. He seems like a nice guy but he goes of on so many random tangents and barely stays on topic. The way he speaks is also pretty confusing. Doesn\u2019t teach like we have zero knowledge, he thinks we already know stuff. Anyone else have this problem?",

            "comment": "Dealing with a class by Professor Foxwell requires a certain mindset. You have to understand that all things are connected. Every single subatomic particle has a minute but discernable on every other particle. The universe is one big dance of contrasting forces, each attempting to influence and leave its mark on the rest. And yet, matter as we know it is the exception to the rule which is emptiness. Even Atoms are 99.9999% space, and never collide except under extreme conditions.\n\nOnce you realize that we will never truly touch matter and instead feel only electron repulsion, it becomes apparent why grasping Earl is so difficult.",

He\u2019s not great at explaining concepts in a way that\u2019s easy to grasp and it\u2019s hard to tell where exactly he\u2019s going with anything he\u2019s talking about, the lectures are truly all over the place.

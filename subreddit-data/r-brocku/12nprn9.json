            "comment": "The buy back sucks. I\u2019ve spent over $100 on individual textbooks in undergrad because I had to get the brand new code and all that crap. The store will offer like 15% of that at most for a book in perfect condition. No one wants to buy them on Facebook anymore, probably because they need a new code too. At this rate I\u2019m probably just going to donate them to a library or another place in need. I\u2019d rather see them go to people in need than have the campus store buy them from me for ten bucks and sell them to students for 150 and make profit.",

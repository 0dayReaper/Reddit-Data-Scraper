    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nSadly I didn't get into Brock's MAcc Program, they said on my Brock portal that I have not been admitted. I had a 79% overall average with a 77% major average but I guess that wasn't enough. I'm just wondering, tho, is there still a chance that I could get into Brock's GDAC Program? Has anyone been in a similar situation as me that could tell me if it's still possible? I don't think the program starts until January 2024 (both MAcc and GDAC).",

I got my rejection from MAcc yesterday and they didn't give me any type of alternative offer. I didn't even get an email or anything. I checked my brock portal and it just says \"Not Admitted\".",

    "postText": "Hello, I'm currently a first year in the bacc co-op program looking to do an early work term this summer, but I feel quite lost on the whole application process and job search. Here are my questions:\n\n1. How do I find job openings specifically for co-op students?\n2. Are there any good firms in St. Catharines or are they mostly in the GTA? \n3. What's it like working in the office at an accounting firm? \n4. I have ACCC 0N90 this winter term coming up, do they go over doing an early co-op term?\n5. General advice?\n6. What should I expect to be paid for my first placement? \n7. Most importantly, how far advance do I have to apply to land a spot for May 2023?\n\nIf someone or a couple people could spend a few minutes helping me out that would be much appreciated!",

Generally speaking though, Toronto is much better in terms of job ops for obvious reasons.\n3. Impossible to answer - very different firm to firm and even office location to office location. My experience has been v lax during non-busy szn, friendly people, and relatively straightforward work, but ymmv.\n4. Yes\n6. Anywhere above 45-50k depending on location is solid, but dw too much about your salary for first internship. Maybe a bit lower if not in Toronto/not at a big firm.\n7. Might as well start now. Big 4 is already done recruiting along with presumably most midsized firms. Look into local firms/large industry companies if you\u2019re not dead set on public. Job board should have stuff",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm in 4th year Accounting Co-op, ill try and give my answers.\n\n1). Career Zone job board. You can look on external sites such as Indeed, but you may be banned from using the Brock job board, can't remember exactly.\n\n2.) Yes there are. Mostly small-mid sized firms, but we do have Big 4 offices in the Niagara region (MNP, KPMG). There are a lot more options in the GTA though\n\n3.) It would vary from office to office. My firm is more laid-back and relaxed whereas a Big 4 might be more intense and cutthroat. It can be stressful and hectic during tax season (March/April) though.\n\n4.) Yes, and they often encourage students to do an early term\n\n5.) If you are in first year, put as much effort as you can so you have a high average that can give you a cushion for the rest of the degree. I would also look at the goodman/career zone events page for networking events and stuff like that so you can at least put your name out there. Maybe even create a LinkedIn account. \n\n6.) Anywhere from minimum wage to low 20s an hour is what I've seen. Big 4's tend to pay salary I believe where as smaller firms pay hourly\n\n7.) Probably within the next few weeks and into February there will start being postings. You might even get emails about them, as I think I used to get them.",

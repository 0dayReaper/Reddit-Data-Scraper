            "comment": "2P90 is amazing, especially if Scott is teaching it. No exams or big tests, just biweekly quizzes and papers. The content was interesting and diverse, and the seminars were great. All the assignments allowed you to be creative as well, different from your usual research papers. However, there are only a few assignments that are worth a lot, so it depends if that\u2019s something you\u2019re comfortable with doing. Honestly kinda biased bc of the prof, but I definitely recommend community psych!",

            "comment": "Lifespan development was the easiest course I did over my whole degree. The prof is condescending and talks to people like they're in 8th grade, but the coursework also appears to be geared to that education level, which is good if you're looking for a bird course. \n\nThe other two weren't offered when I did second year, but I did interview Scott Neufled (I think he's community psyc?) For my thesis, and he's a great guy. I can see his class being very interesting and well designed.",

            "comment": "I took 2P90 with Scott and I loved the courses. There wasn't any exams. Only weekly/biweekly quizzes that were so easy. There's also weekly discussion posts that you had to have done by the end of the semester. If I'm being completely honest, I did not always go to the lectures because I felt like I was doing well in the course without having to go. The assignments were super easy and common sense. What's great about this courses is that all the assignment have a one week extension! The only thing that I think some people might find as a struggle is that the seminar are very heavily based on participation. To get a full mark on the seminar portion you had to contribute to the discussions during class. I only say it might be a struggle because if you're not comfortable speaking in front of others and struggle with social anxiety (like me), it will be hard to get any marks on the seminars.",

Can\u2019t give much insight into it as I have not experienced the exchange but will say that you should make a decision as soon as possible. I waited awhile as I wasn\u2019t sure what school I was going and ended up with my third choice as everything else was full. I do think that the German pathway will be unique in that it will teach me a valuable skill of having to learn German but that might not be something that you want to deal with",

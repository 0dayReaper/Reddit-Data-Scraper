    "postText": "Hi, I really want to transfer from a small college in another province to Brock University in the Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences program. I have an average of 90-95%, which I think is A? On the website it says mid-70s are the cutoff, Bs for transfer students. Anyways, I just want to make sure that I actually have chances lol. I know it's a small program, but is it bc relatively few people apply or bc it's restricted?",

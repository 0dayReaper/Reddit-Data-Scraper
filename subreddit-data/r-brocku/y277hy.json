The program consists of a 2-hour course delivered in a virtual classroom, which includes information on:\n\n\u2022 Stigma &amp; Harm Reduction\n\n\u2022 How to respond to an opioid poisoning\n\n\u2022 How to administer nasal naloxone\n\n\u2022 Self-Care after a Traumatic Event\n\n**Participants who complete the course will receive 2 free nasal naloxone kits**\u00a0for use in an emergency. Naloxone is mailed and paid for by SJA. Naloxone is a medicine that rapidly reverses the effects of opioids on the brain. It is an important tool that can save the life of someone experiencing an opioid poisoning.\n\nThere are 2 different training streams to better serve residents of Canada:\n\n1. For individuals and communities facing barriers to opioid poisoning education and nasal naloxone,\u00a0[**Register Here**](https://calendly.com/oprt/opioid-poisoning-response-training-1)**!**\n2.

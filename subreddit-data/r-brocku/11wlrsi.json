All theoretical that has gone in  one ear and out the other. Idk maybe im just not cut out for it im just wondering if anyone feels the same",

It\u2019s very theoretical and I find that interest is purely based on the enthusiasm of the professor in my experience. \n\nI\u2019ve found other academic interests and gained a new perspective on myself throughout these past 5 years which I value greatly. Although it may not be for me I still loved my experience + the people I met. It might just not be for you if it\u2019s in one ear and out the other",

Judging by your post and comments, maybe psych just wasn\u2019t the right program for you? Maybe university wasn\u2019t right either? \n\nBefore I came to Brock I spent 2 years at college where my learning experience was completely different and much better suited for me. I know it doesn\u2019t help now but just some food for thought. You are not alone!",

            "comment": "University generally (unless you are in co-op) does not provide practical experience but general theoretical background. And you should\u2019ve known that beforehand. But even if you didn\u2019t you should\u2019ve had enough sense at some point to realize that this wasn\u2019t fulfilling for you and left. I am someone who has learnt a great deal from this program but up until recently did not know what to do after grad and felt lost. Psych (and most majors now a days) have limited options for jobs that have direct application of the content you learnt in undergrad. \n\nAfter taking PSYC 4P08 (data analytics) I realized that this is the path I want to peruse. Throughout the program we are dealing with data, analyzing data, and effective communication of data (all aspects of data analytics). But even before that I was thinking of jobs that even had a broad application of what I did here (e.g., marketing, hr) all of which would likely require additional training through a college course or masters. \n\nIf you have read this far for some reason, many people feel this way after competing an undergrad and this isn\u2019t restricted to psych. The problem is that a basic undergrad degree doesn\u2019t get you much anymore, which can lead to people feeling like you\u2019ve been cheated out of a degree.",

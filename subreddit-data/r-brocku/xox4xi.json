    "postText": "Anyone have ACTG 3p41 with su sheng this semester? If so, have you learned anything at all in the lectures? She seems like a nice lady but good god she can not teach. She teaches us like she expects us to already know what she\u2019s talking about, but we have no experience in tax at all so how are we supposed to know? Even the most important concepts she will start explaining for 10 seconds then get side tracked about a story of when she was in school and then just move on. It\u2019s so frustrating, I want to do well in the class but I have no idea how to do so with her as a professor. Anyone else agree?",

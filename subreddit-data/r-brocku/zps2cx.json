    "postText": "So I am trying to switch my major next year, and the academic advisor advised that I take one more half humanities credit and then a second year elective course that doesn\u2019t require a prerequisite. Anyone have any suggestions? I\u2019d prefer them to be asynchronous but any suggestions help",

            "comment": "For humanities context: STAC 1P97 (you\u2019ll have to click to be waitlisted but you might get in and it\u2019s the only asynchronous humanities context course besides VISA 1Q99 which is full. For sync or in person, there are only three options open right now, ENGL 1P91, ENGL 1P94, and IASC 1P06 and out of those three I believe ENGL 1P91 might be the best option since the other two courses have professors who are considered harder markers and such. But you can always keep checking the registration portal every so often before January and see if any spots open up for CLAS 1P92, CLAS 1P97, CLAS 2P34, or any of the first year DART/VISA courses. \n\nFor ASYNC 2nd year electives: There is LABR 2P86, LABR 2P93, and ENSU 2P02. These are the only ones that are not full right now. \n\nIf none of those interest you, you can take these ones sync or in person (that aren\u2019t full currently): CLAS 2P94, CANA 2P92, ENTR 2P51, ENGL 2Q91, HIST 2P02, HIST 2P66, FNCE 2P51, LABR 2P90, LABR 2Q96, ITAL 2P91, ITAL 2P92, ItAL 2Q95, INDG 2P51, INDG 2P91, LING 2P20, LING 2P93, PHIL 2P09, PHIL 2P18, PHIL 2Q91, PHIL 2P25, VISA 2P51, VISA 2P88, ViSA 2Q96, WGST 2P92, WRDS 2P18",

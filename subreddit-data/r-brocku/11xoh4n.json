Pros are the rooms are big and there\u2019s a living area; it\u2019s more private and there\u2019s a kitchen (ended up never cooking once!). Cons are QV is a good 15 mins walk to most classes and dining hall. I\u2019d probably choose decew if I were you, because it\u2019s on the same block as dining hall and more convenient overall especially in winter.\n\n\nI had the opportunity to select my choices from the list when applying. You can view the houses and amenities on Brock\u2019s website too. I got my first choice which is good.\n\nLook up the costs, kind of expensive + meal plan. Much cheaper to live off campus but you lose that closeness/convenience.",

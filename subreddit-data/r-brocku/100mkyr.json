            "comment": "Getting a course changed from in person to online is extremely difficult. There\u2019s typically a lot of logistical issues with courses and typically involves multiple parties to get changed. For it to possibly happen, you\u2019d need support of the instructor, TAs, office of the registrar and probably around 80-90% of the students taking the course. Summer courses are typically on a tight schedule so teaching and learning in person is far more effective. Also given COVID, universities are strongly moving away from online learning. If it\u2019s imperative to learn online, might be best to look outside the uni at other universities to see if they offer an online one that fulfills the credit",

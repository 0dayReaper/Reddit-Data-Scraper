    "postText": "Hi ! My home university has a partnership with Brock University for their graduate program - I could attend Brock\u2019s Master in Psychology for 1 semester.\n\nHow is your experience at Brock and would you recommend it ?\nIs the Psychology program good ?\nAlso, on the website I was able to see only the name of 5 mandatory classes in the MA (on the page where everything about this master is explained) but I wasn\u2019t able to find a list of the elective courses that I could take. Specifically, I would need to find classes that could replace two mandatory classes from my home university : \u00ab\u00a0applied statistics\u00a0\u00bb and \u00ab\u00a0evaluation of psychological interventions\u00a0\u00bb. Does anyone know where I can find this info ?\n\nThank you in advance !",

    "postText": "I was wondering if anyone has taken these courses during the summer so that I could get some feedback on how they are set up. Both seemed to be Syncronious, but I was wondering if the lectures are recorded, or if you have to attend the MS Teams lectures/ labs. I was also wondering if they had an in-person final exam. \n\nThe reason why I am asking is that I will be working throughout the summer, and my job doesn't have regular hours so I can't really attend formal lectures. \n\nI appreciate all the help.",

It is very likely that I\u2019m going to attend brock for con Ed but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s extremely white- is this true? For people who are currently attending, is there a good amount of diversity?",

There have been a lot of instances where I would be the only or one of the very few POC in a classroom. The campus in general is still heavily white but there is some noticeable diversity. Everyone is pretty considerate though so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

But also what seems like half of Brampton ends up in Brock\u2019s first year accounting program too lol. This is what it was like 7 years ago when I started there. I\u2019ve been back and it\u2019s even more diverse. There were always many Asian international students, and now it includes African and Indian students too - although the international groups usually keep in their circles. Niagara region itself has increased in diversity. I remember going to the hospital on fourth ave in second year. I felt weird being the only brown guy in the emerg. But now it\u2019s mixed-not to gta levels but not where you\u2019re the only one lol. Never had outward issues with racism either. Diversity would be more of an \u201cissue\u201d at schools up north than any in southern Ontario. Niagara is pretty local relative to the gta with many people moving there in the last 10 years from the gta",

There is a returning students award that also starts at 80.  Other awards may have different requirements.\n\nFrom the website:\n\nAward renewals will be assessed after completing of each milestone 5.0 full credits, and will be based on their best 5.0 full credits. A minimum 80 per cent average  in each milestone is required to renew the award. Milestones will be assessed when students reach 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 cumulative credits",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am looking for a sublet from May-August. Rent is $650/month with utilities and wifi included! It is just a quick 4 minute bus to Brock and about a 7 minute bus to the Pen Centre. It is an upstairs unit, laundry on site, pets allowed, and comes with all the essentials!! House will be empty most of the time so lots of privacy. Message me if you are interested or have any questions/want to see pictures.",

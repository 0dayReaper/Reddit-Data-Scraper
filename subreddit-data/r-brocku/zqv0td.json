I've heard some horror stories from my friends who took the regular 12-week term offering so I highly suggest taking the spring week long one. \n\nI took it online so it might be different if it's in person but there's an assignment due each evening (very basic just to prove you listened to lecture) I think a couple quizzes, and a final paper due 1 week after the course ends. \n\nI can't remember any specifics about Mark breakdown or anything but it was honestly a really easy course so I'd recommend it for sure.",

Once again it was a few easy quizzes and assignments throughout the month and a final paper!",

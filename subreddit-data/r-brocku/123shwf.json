Internet is not helping anymore. \nif someone has knowledge in SPSS and could offer to help, I would be more than grateful. \n(I can offer German chocolate and I guess a hug lol) \nThank you!!",

From what I\u2019ve understood, the error you might be getting is from how everything is selected going into the one way ANOVAs\n\nIf anything, there are also copies of \u201cdiscovering statistics using SPSS statistics\u201d available for download that have definitely helped me with programming my ANOVAs. Although the 5th edition is the newest, the 4th edition is the most accessible",

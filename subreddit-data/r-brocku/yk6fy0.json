For those of you who were accepted into the program, could you tell me what your average was and what were your chances of getting in? I've heard it's competitive, and it's honestly making me worry\n\nDoes everyone who do the BAcc degree at brock apply to the MAcc program? I'm generally just curious what everyone's though process is.",

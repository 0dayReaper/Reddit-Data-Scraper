    "postText": "Okay so I don't mean to denigrate your university at all, I'm just simply a panicked neurotic guy.\n\nBut anyway, I'm about to pursue an MBA, to be blunt for the purpose of a try at immigration. UofT, McGill, etc... require atleast 2 years of work experience and I simply can't stay in my country for 2 more years. So naturally I have to look at universities with co-op, and yours seems great! It was my top choice. Location near some family I have in Ontario, great specialization choices and allegedly a large co-op program. And yet on reddit I'm reading things like \"If you can walk and talk, etc..., absolutely don't go to Brock it's looked down upon\" or \"You must be delusional if you think you could ever get a good job at a bank with a Brock MBA\" (which is quite bizzare to me, isn't this the whole point of co-op?) \n\nIs there any truth to this stuff are they simply morons who don't know anything? I would appreciate any answers and thank you advance.",

A popular saying around Canada is that \u201cif you can walk and talk, you can go to Brock\u201d, but that shouldn\u2019t detract from the fact that university is what you make of it, especially for post graduate studies. You aren\u2019t there to party and mess around like most undergrads, you have a set plan. As long as you stick to that plan and pour your effort into studying and pursuing what career you want to get into with your MBA you should be head and shoulders above many others who simply go to prestigious schools for the sake of its \u201cranking\u201d. You have the opportunity to be one of the front runners at a school that isn\u2019t known for business, so would you rather be the cream of the crop at Brock? Or lost in the middle of the pack at UofT or other programs. Of course, it\u2019s much harder at Brock to break through because they might not have resources or all the other jargon that bigger schools have, but that just means you\u2019ll have to find ways to create opportunities for yourself inside and outside of the classroom. \n\nHope this helps",

From an education point of view, it\u2019s a wash, and you have a BBA so an MBA is not going to really teach you much you don\u2019t already know (hence why you can do accelerated MBAs, which still teach repeating courses).\n\nSecond, there\u2019s a dumb stereotype for every university. If you\u2019re an alcoholic go to Western. If you\u2019re and out of touch rich kid go to U of T. Etc.\n\nI agree with others that uni is what you make it. And you\u2019ll be better off with work experience, unless you\u2019re willing to take some low paying jobs with an MBA for a few years.",

I'm focusing on business systems analyst jobs, which are more focused on BBAs and work experience.

I was in the undergrad accounting program in its business school, so I doubt its MBA is much better.\n\nAlso, your MBA plan right now is not a good one for value-for-money/job purposes and you should look into other ways to immigrate. Let's just say there is a reason why all reputable MBA's require 2-years minimum of work exp (with the avg being 4-5 years) and Brock's doesn't require any. The value of an MBA is only realized when you have sufficient experience prior to going into it.",

            "comment": "The reputation of the MBA program matters. Many international students are pursuing an MBA for immigration purposes and I have seen most of them struggling to find a job with it. You absolutely need to go to a brand-name school for your MBA, especially if you have little or no work experience and no connections in Canada. If you need to pursue post-secondary education for immigration purposes, then do a cheaper master's degree or college diploma.\n\nAn MBA is a professional master's degree. When you apply for jobs in an MBA co-op program, the #1 thing employers will be looking at is your prior work experience. That is why most MBA programs require work experience. You know automatically that any MBA program that does not require extensive work experience is a complete cash-grab program and will not be taken seriously by employers. Employers that recruit candidates through an MBA co-op or internship program are typically hiring for mid-level to senior roles and not entry-level positions. Before you waste money on an MBA, you need to do your research into what an MBA program is and why people do it. Being in a co-op program does not guarantee you a job. You still need to apply for jobs yourself and be hired through the process.",

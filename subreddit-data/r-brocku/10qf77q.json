    "postText": "Got my first ticket the other day after 3 years. Noticed that they added an extra digit to my plate number, it\u2019s just one too many of a repeating digit so it\u2019s probably still traceable to my home but wanted to ask if anyone\u2019s had a similar thing. I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s not really necessary to pay at all and I\u2019ve never once registered my car other than to the honk app. Naturally I don\u2019t want my car towed so just looking for any pointers. Would rather not pay it either but if it\u2019s the wrong plate they have, why bother?",

            "comment": "You can look up online how many tickets you\u2019ve accumulated by typing in your license plate number. If you look up your license plate and there\u2019s no ticket there, you\u2019re good. If you see you owe a ticket it\u2019s up to you if you want to pay it. I know plenty of people that haven\u2019t paid their ticket (they\u2019ve only gotten one or two). But after three I\u2019d be concerned about being towed. Also, they can\u2019t trace your license plate to you unless you\u2019ve registered your plate under your name at brock. In that case, they could withhold you from graduating until you pay your ticket. But if you\u2019ve never registered your plate, they don\u2019t know it\u2019s you unless you got towed and had to go retrieve your car. \n\nhttps://parking.brocku.ca/tickets/",

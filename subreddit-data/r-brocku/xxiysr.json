But please, if you have a common cold or something and still come to class, wear a mask. I\u2019ve been in a few classes where a student is coughing up a lung without a mask on which is so inconsiderate. Whether it\u2019s COVID-19 or not, nobody wants your germs.\n\nSave your comments about \u201cface diapers don\u2019t work \ud83d\udc11\u201d because I\u2019m not reading them anyway.",

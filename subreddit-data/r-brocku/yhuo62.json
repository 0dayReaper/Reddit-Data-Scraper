    "postText": "Is it just or has it been extremely hard finding ways to commute to Brock from Brampton/Mississauga? There used to be a 1h 30ish min Megabus that went from Square One to Brock but that got cancelled and it was replaced with a Go Bus that goes from Brock to Hamilton go, and now it takes a few bus transfers and close to 3 hours to get to Square One now. On top of that, the Brockride share groups have gone completely downhill! it went from being a group for students charging 10-15$ for ride shares to random people (not brock students) trying to profit off of students, people trying to scam and prey on students and those people now try to charge 30-50$ per seat for rides, all of that makes it super difficult to find ways to commute to Brock!\n\nI wish Brock would do something to bring back a bus similar to the megabus that used to be here before covid :(",

It does suck not being able to take a bus directly from Brampton to Brock but I think taking the direct go bus from Aldershot GO is the next best thing.",

                    "comment": "The way I see it, and the way I've noticed it going since I've been at Brock (since 2017) ride shares are usually students who are already going home or to brock, and its more of a \"since I'm going that way already, I can take you with me if you pitch in for gas\" so up until this year majority of people I've taken ride shares have only ever asked for 10-15$. And yes with increasing gas prices the cost did go up, but now brock students who offer ride shares are asking for 15-20$ in my experience, and I've noticed that its non-Brock students who charge more, and its justifiable for them because they often are going out of the way to take people back and forth, but the purpose of ride shares is brock students helping other brock students out! But also this has happened because the ride-share group became public this year, allowing anyone to join, so it's not just brock students in those groups anymore. It now includes people who are trying to make profits. \n\nI also don't commute daily, but it's the odd weekend or weekday I need to go back home or return to brock, and it's very difficult to find rides those days, so I've been driving.  I've encountered a conflict with ride-shares and bussing this year that I've never had to deal with before. You are right commuting has turned into a huge pain this year! I've been able to rely on the mega bus that went from Square one to BrockU",

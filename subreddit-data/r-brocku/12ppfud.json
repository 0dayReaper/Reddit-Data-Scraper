Does everything from our student email roll over (so nothing gets lost/it looks the same \u2014 almost like the student emails forwards everything to the alumni account)? \n\nI checked on the ITS pages and nothing really covers this specific topic and I don\u2019t know anyone who can answer this definitively and I have no idea which ITS help desk I should contact about this. Has anyone had their student email reconfigured into an alumni account and can answer this?",

If we place each other's names in our residence applications, are we guaranteed to share a room? (we both have 90+ averages, if that is a factor)",

I originally applied for the Accounting program with co-op, and I did inquire with admissions if it would be possible to switch over to the BBA program. They reached back and they made the change for me, but overnight the system reverted it.  \nSent another email again, and they fixed the issue, yet it seems it happened again this evening... not sure what to do about that",

Also in your application put that having your requested roommate is your biggest priority",

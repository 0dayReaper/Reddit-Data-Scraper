    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am in need of desperate advice because I seriously messed up. I am a first-year student at York.\n\nBack in the 2021 admission cycle, I applied to a bunch of universities. After not getting into the ones I wanted. Last min, I accepted and enrolled at Brock. About a week or so into it, I decided to withdraw and take another gap year and a half to figure things out, etc and reapply for 2022 also I lived in Toronto and it was too late for me to get residence. I can't recall correctly but it seems that I did not properly withdraw from the program/courses and received an email last week saying I had overdue fees. (There was silence prior to this)\n\nAfter several tries of getting into my account, I finally logged in and saw the emails. Apparently, I had received grades and I believe was put on academic probation. They are letting me submit a backdated withdrawal form which I am currently in the process of filling out but not quite sure what to add to it besides a proof of enrolment at my current uni and a personal statement. I'm not sure what to do, my university thinks I am a first year, and I don't want to get kicked out of my current university because of this, and even if I have to take a financial hit because of it that is fine. I completely had no idea about this situation.\n\nPlease if anyone can offer any advice.",

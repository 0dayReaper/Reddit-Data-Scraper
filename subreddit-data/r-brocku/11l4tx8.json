It very much depends where in the research process you are that can heavily influence how much work.\n\nLast semester while working towards an abstract, I had 3 courses and 2 courses I TA\u2019d for. Weekly, it roughly translated to 6 hours in the lab, 12 hours of class, 6-8 hours of studying/homework, and 6-8 hours of TA-ing a week. Bigger projects and theses are looking at anywhere between 10-18+ hours a week in the lab.\n\nOverall for workload within the lab, it depends on lab size/numbers along with specifics of research. My area is within muscle physiology, so some days it\u2019s just letting the programs/equipment run its course, in which other  things can be done. Other days it\u2019s more data analysis which requires full attention. The more people in a given lab, the bigger the project overall, but individual work is usually less. A big thing is that it\u2019s an area for learning and collaborations/building connections so it doesn\u2019t feel like work part of the time.\n\nAlso being funded doesn\u2019t hurt \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I do know people who got in with high 70\u2019s-low 80\u2019s but most that are applying are typically mid 80\u2019s-90 average student. One of the biggest things to help solidify a chance is building rapport with prospective supervisors, which can slightly overturn lower averages. Will it fix it? Not fully, but it gives you a better chance. \n\nFrom the sounds of it, you\u2019re either in your last or 2nd last year. Applications for the upcoming year are past due so if you\u2019re done after this year, I strongly recommend trying to improve some marks where possible. Most supervisors have either figured out their students or are currently in the process. If you still have another year to go, I would establish what would give you an 80 average, and start connecting with prospective supervisors now. You need to connect with supervisors prior to applying (you\u2019ll rank your choices during the application) and it allows for possible volunteering.",

Which is annoying because most only care about the last two, but due to covid and online school which isn\u2019t for me my average dropped a lot at the end :/. I was just curious. Thanks",

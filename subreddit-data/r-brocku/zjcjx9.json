I took math in grade 11 and am currently right now in grade 12 and I checked the admission requirements and it says I need 2 Senior math. I'm not sure if brock considers grade 11 math as also Senior or if to apply I need to be taking 2 grade 12 level math courses. Any clarification or answers to this would be a huge help!",

I'm in BC so the course I am taking right now is called Pre-Calculus 12 but its just 1 Math course that I'm taking right now so I'm just trying to figure out if I can even apply to Brock Business Administration.",

You would have to ask academic advisors about that, but if you are going to be fulfilling two math credits then it should show on your transcript that you are doing them but that they are just not completed. Its not like you need to be taking two senior math credits at the time you apply, you just need to have two senior math credits appear on your transcript. In most highschools, atleast where I live, you couldnt take calc until 2nd semester anyways.",

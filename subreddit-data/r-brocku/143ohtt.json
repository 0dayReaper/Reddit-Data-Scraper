    "postText": "Just as the title says, does anyone have any recommendations for extra courses to take for year 1 of BBA undergrad (with co-op)? Anything that combines a light work load with being interesting would be nice.\n\nI\u2019m not too sure which concentration I wish to go into, not sure if that would affect any suggestions. Thanks!",

            "comment": "I'm just wrapping up my BBA, and the first-year level electives I took are:\n\nCPCF 1F95 - REGRET\n\nCOMM 1F90 - Great course, thoroughly enjoyed, not hard, engaging prof (Derek Foster).\n\nCOSC 1P02 - Introduction to Java, basically. I found it hard for a while as I had no coding background, but it clicked after a while. RIP Prof. John Futers.\n\nIASC 1P10 - Intro to different multimedia programs, fun &amp; easy course.\n\nERSC 1P94 - Easiest course I've taken. Learn about the planets of the solar system.\n\nAnd if I can hawk a BBA Concentration, I did Information Systems (reviewed it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/brocku/comments/13m68rk/review_of_itis_courses_bba_information_systems/)), as there are many well paying jobs as a business systems analyst, or computer systems analyst, systems quality analysts, etc. And, conveniently, \"computer systems analyst\" (CSA) is one of the TN-Nafta visa classes, meaning if you have a relevant degree (which BBA Info Sys Concentration is), you can work as a CSA in the United States and qualify easily for a TN work visa (3-year renewable visa). This is exactly what I'm doing as CSA/BSA's make stupid money in the US. I'm looking at 80-120k USD positions, totally bonkers. And I don't have to do finance! Praise the gord.",

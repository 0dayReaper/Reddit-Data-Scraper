    "postText": "i keep my notes digitally yeah, but i like having a physical textbook. especially when it comes to money, id rather spend a bit more knowing i\u2019m able to sell the textbook when i\u2019m done with it, what do you do w an online textbook when you\u2019re done with it? it\u2019s not a pdf so i can\u2019t download it. waste of money imo and i hate it when you have the option to buy it physical but professors need u to have an \u201caccess code\u201d",

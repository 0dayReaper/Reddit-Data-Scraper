No way of knowing what'll be offered online in Fall/Winter til they post those timetables, but they've really cut down on the amount that're offered. ERSC 1P94 is one off the top of my head I'd think is online as they made a whole website for it when I took it, but that was during the campus shutdowns. Enjoyable and easy course, a few quizzes and 1-nighter assignments.",

They did cancel evening classes for snow a couple of years ago, but we had much more than 5-10cm of snow that day. \n\nI'm on campus right now, and all the roads are completely clear of snow on and around campus, so unless the snow becomes severely worse, I'd assume they'll stay open all day.",

Just suddenly cancel classes with people already getting ready and just abandon the people with earlier classes already on campus? I highly doubt they'd make a decision this late.",

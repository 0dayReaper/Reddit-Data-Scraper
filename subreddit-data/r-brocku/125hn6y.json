Always wanted to go into Sports Management, especially at Brock but it is a massive financial commitment as instead of commuting which I\u2019m currently doing, I would need to move there. Just wanted to hear some opinions from people who are in the program right now. How are the professors?, quality of life, etc.",

            "comment": "I disagree with the folks who are bashing it. It\u2019s the best program in Canada. The professors are highly regarded in the wider academic field. Of course, most students have very little interest in the academic side of uni. \n\nYou will get out of it what you put in. Yes you have specific sport courses, but it is not a golden ticket to working in sport. No degree is. But it might open you up to the wider career possibilities and what sport entails (there is a lot more then just the TML). If you are passionate about the topics, put in the effort to network, and search for opportunities, you may be able to find a sport job.",

Its just such a tough situation since there is great risk for future job opportunities because of the fact that this degree won\u2019t look nearly as good as an Accounting and Finance degree for example. On the other hand, I don\u2019t think I can mentally make it through 3 more years of this Accounting program, as soft as I sound. I just need to do my research and man up to a decision.",

Most of my boys here that did SPMA got jobs that they coulda got with just any degree honestly. If you want to work in sports its more about connections honestly. You dont need a SPMA degree.",

When i was in hs I wanted to work in management for a hockey team so I came to Brock cause i got in for BBA and thought i could take SPMA courses thinking those two together would set me up. But once I got here I realized two things. First, management in hockey has a lot of nepotism and requires you to have connections more than education. Second, SPMA is just a useless program. Like i said everyone that ik has a job that was in SPMA coulda got it without it and theres plenty of others who did it and couldnt even get a job in sports and cant do anything else with a degree that niche.",

Talks too much about stuff related to his personal life and then quizzes on it later expecting word for word exactly what he said in the class or else you don\u2019t get the mark. Didn\u2019t give us the full instructions for the term paper so (at least my whole seminar) didn\u2019t have a component of it that was worth a mark (yes Ik one mark doesn\u2019t really matter, but it\u2019s a good example of the level of communication in the class. Over 40% of people failed the final so if I had to guess, plenty failed the entire class\n\nSPMA-1P92 with Kikulis \n\nThis class was incredibly boring and another long rambling lecture that goes off the rails very quick. Everything in the course is online though to success is pretty attainable. \n\nSPMA-1P93 with McKee\n\nThis class is genuinely good. Fantastic content and a great lecturer teaching it. Exams and papers were somewhat graded tough but pretty easy to succeed in this class. McKee is really approachable and understand who he is teaching so the class is actually teaching you and not just throwing testable answers at you in the middle of long winded life stories \n\nSPMA-1P94 with Stevens\n\nThis course was added because the graduates and co-op representatives were not professional enough. This is teaching you the theory of how to be likeable and professional while ignoring the actual important fact that people aren\u2019t robots and studying how to be viewed by coworkers is illogical because a textbook doesn\u2019t change peoples personalities and actions. As for the prof the entire first lecture is essentially her telling half truths about how the course is gonna go. In fact my TA for this class told me how 1st year is essentially bullshit courses designed to get people out of the program when they accept too many people as a cash grab.",

                    "comment": "Our experiences have been very different. I guess I can go point by point here.\n\n1P91- Dr. Hyatt is a beauty. He tells stories because they relate to the course material. The amazing thing about this class is that he tells you what you need to know for assignments, but also give you plenty of opportunity to ask questions in his office hours, or to the TA who marks the work. If you never take advantage of this, that's on you- not him. 40% of your cohort failed? That must be nice- over 50% of mine did. He must be getting soft.\n\n  \n1P92- I had a different prof for this, but every interactions I've ever had with Dr. Kikulis have been friendly. She is very straightforward, honest, and to the point\n\n  \n1P93- Didn't exist when I was in first year. My few interactions with Dr. McKee have been fine.\n\n  \n1P94- This course most certainly was not a recent addition. It has been a SPMA staple for the longest time. I hear the seminars are new, but that is because there are many many many students who do not pay attention to lecture. This is a very foundational course. If your TA is telling you these things, sorry bud, but you don't have a good TA. First year university isn't meant to weed people out- it is meant to give folks a good foundation for what to expect in your future at Brock. If you can't handle that, and expect to be given high marks for having a pulse, sorry to break it to you but unfortunately that's not how it works.  \nSometimes a program just isn't for you. Just because you like sport doesn't mean you'll ace the program. It is an academic degree that requires actual work and effort, not just knowing statistics from pro sport. As someone who went through the program, while it does have it's faults, the highly regarded professors certainly isn't one of them.",

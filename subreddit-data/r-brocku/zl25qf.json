Most likely you\u2019ll have to take the first year pre-requisite courses before you fill out that change of major declaration form. I\u2019m switching my major to child and youth studies next year, and when I met with the CHYS advisor they said I should use my current courses as science/humanities credits and take the chys first year courses next fall, then after the year is over submit that change of major form. Hope this helps in some way",

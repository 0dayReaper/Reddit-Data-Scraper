    "postText": "Im not sure if i have to retake my french class. I find out my results May 8th, but i have to apply obvi before then. If May 8th comes and It turns out that I dont have to retake it, i only get a 50% refund. If I do then no big deal, but May 7th is when I can get a full refund for the course. Is this brock\u2019s way of like scamming me? or is it this way for anyone else?",

In terms of the assignments they\u2019re actually incredibly straightforward and the first few literally take less than 15 minutes. \n\nBUT MAKE SURE YOU GO TO LECTURES. The final exam is take home where you have to draw from specific definitions in your notes. If you try to use the internet you\u2019ll get a 0.\n\nBut Simon Black as a professor is incredible if it\u2019s being taught by him again. The TA I had (Karen) was kind of meh",

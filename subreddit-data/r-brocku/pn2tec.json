The vaccine mandate is probably going to help slow things down but the vaccines aren\u2019t infallible, and with how suddenly brock is attempting to return to traditional learning it\u2019s only a matter of time before it comes crashing down IMO.\n\nAnyone have a different opinion? I\u2019d like to remain optimistic about our current situation but IMO we are returning to in person classes way too quickly.",

I know that some people hated online, but the school could\u2019ve made it optional. If you wanna go in person go and if not stay home. But we can\u2019t always get what we want.

I feel I absorb information much better and can pay attention much easier with in person classes, online just didn\u2019t work for me in that regard.

I\u2019m dreading having to drive there in the winter as there is zero online options. \n\nAt the end of the day, I\u2019d do the commute and get over it. But having school online has been awesome. My grades have reflected it too. I don\u2019t *hope* everyone has to go online, because it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea but I hope they offer an online option in the winter at the very least.",

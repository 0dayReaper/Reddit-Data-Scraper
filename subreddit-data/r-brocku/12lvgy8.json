There are also tests and midterms in some. \n\n- ECON 2P23 (Managerial Economics)\n- ECON 2P28 (Economics of the environment)\n- ECON 2P46 (Economic of China) only the calculation \n- ECON 2P91 (Econometrics)\n- ITIS 1P97 (Data Analysis &amp; Business Modeling)\n- ITIS 2P91 (Management of Info Systems &amp; Technology)\n- OPER 2P91 (Operations Management)\n- FNCE 4P05 (International Finance)\n- ASTR 1P02 (introduction to astronomy 2)\n\nI had 95% or higher as the end grade in all of them. \n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like them and we can arrange how you get them :)\n\nUpdate: all notes have been distributed!!!",

    "postText": "A graduate student has thankfully brought to our attention the corruption that is occurring within the graduate student association. There has been no minutes posted since 2021, several students have allegedly tried to apply for positions but links don\u2019t work\u2026 which leads to all three positions being unopposed. Their current policy is only 5% turn out on voting is required for reelection which is ridiculous. \n\nThey charge us roughly $1000 a year for services that aren\u2019t accounted for. \n\nWe stand with grad students and we want fairness going forward. \n\nHopefully, the \u201cno\u201d votes were enough.",

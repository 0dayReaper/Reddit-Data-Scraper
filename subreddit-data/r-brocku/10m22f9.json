    "postText": "Having spent the last part of enough time in Vancouver, I may be overly worried. But is there issues with bicycle theft on campus? Potentially getting a very good deal on an expensive road bike, but don't want to just end up with it being stolen. Is there a safe bike parking area on campus for when you're in class?",

            "comment": "I haven't heard of an issue with bikes around campus. I'd just recommend getting a hardened U-shape bike lock with a disc detainer lock core in it. I've had a bike stolen before, any sort of flexible bike lock can be cut in two seconds, whereas U-locks are much more difficult, however many of them also have cheap lock cores that can be jiggled open (disc detainer lock is much more difficult). \n\nCheck out lockpickinglawyer on youtube xD",

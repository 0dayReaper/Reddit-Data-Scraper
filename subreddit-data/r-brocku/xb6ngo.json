    "postText": "In this post, I explain what has worked for me, and for other students that I have talked to. The idea is to get you decent marks without having to spend too much time studying, working on assignments, or procrastinating. These tips are no magic bullet and do not replace genuine effort. In no particular order they are as follows:\n\n1: Study consistently and in small amounts: 5 minutes of reviewing your notes at the end of each lecture is much more efficient than in one long cram session at the end of the semester. It is also a lot easier to get yourself to do something when you put a set limit on how much you will do.\n\n2: Know your tools and get good at finding information: Almost every course has some free tool you can use to help in some way. For english/essay writing assignments, there is Grammarly, for math there's Desmos, for comp-sci there are IDE's, github, and so on. The internet is also a tool itself, but sorting through vast amounts of information can be difficult at first. Over time you'll gain an idea of what keywords to use and how to phrase your internet queries. There are guides for it as well.\n\n3: Find a group of people in the course. This seems obvious but it is easy to make the mistake of waiting until a course picks up speed. Having multiple minds and memories makes figuring out problems significantly easier (no plagiarism though!!) and working with others will also motivate you to do better. You will also gain valuable friends if you put in the effort to stay in contact.\n\n4: Practice good health: Drink water, floss, get exercise, maintain good posture. If you don't know where to add exercise into a routine, see if you can walk to home/Brock/job/stores instead of taking the bus/car. That actually saves some time by combining transport and exercise. Sleep is important too. I know some people struggle with going to bed early, so if you have to stay up late, at least try to go to bed at a consistent time. This will keep you focused and refreshed, letting you act more efficiently.\n\n5: Think about how you study and how you spend your day: This is going to sound weird at first, but you need to observe and examine how you approach stuff to find out what your strengths are. Much like how you run a computer program to find out where the bugs are occurring, you first have to actually see how you go though your day before you decide what your issue is. When I looked at how I wrote essays, I found that I wasted the most time starting the essay. I wouldn't know how to start, or was worried about how I would fit it together later. I then knew what to fix and learned how to create an effective essay outline and then fill it out (that is a topic itself), letting me create essays much more quickly.\n\n6: Reach out for help (and know how to ask for help): This is probably the most important, since for whatever reason many people do not have to self-respect to ask for help. Believe it or not, your teacher (probably) wants you to succeed and will help if you ask. When asking a question, it is important to ask clearly. State what you do know, what you don't know, and what you are hoping to learn. Do not just ask an answer to a single sentence question like \"How do I solve \\[problem\\]\", as either they will ask you for further details, or give an answer that may not work for you.\n\n7: Music: If drums and chants can drive entire civilizations to war, then they can absolutely drive you to finish your calculus. Keep a playlist for when you need to work, and keep a second playlist for when you really need to get serious (kinda like your own boss battle music). Don't play that music (especially the second playlist) any other time, so that your brain associates it with getting into study mode. \n\nHopefully, you find these tips helpful. Best of luck in the school year, and share your own experiences as well.",

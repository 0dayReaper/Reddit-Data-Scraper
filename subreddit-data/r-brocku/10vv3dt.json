I genuinely feel like I am going to end up dropping the major cause I feel very anxious and scared right now. I don\u2019t want to but it feels like I am getting close, I seriously need help. Where can I get a tutor for cs? Is there any place where people advertise on campus?\n\n\n\nThanks.",

The Drop-In hours for CompSci are Monday (12-2pm), Tuesday + Thursday (4-6pm).\n\nIf you are looking for more specific information, I recommend going to their site: [https://brocku.ca/student-life-success/learning-services/](https://brocku.ca/student-life-success/learning-services/)\n\nI wish you luck with your classes!",

I don't know which course or assignment it is, but know they've all been done before. I joined Cosc when they switched to Java and the lab assistants were learning as we learned. It was terrible. A lot of people dropped out in the first few months. You made it to Feb, you can do this. What is the assignment? Nobody will do the work for you but knowing the theory and how to apply it to the assignment is part of the puzzle. What are you covering in class, do your notes have any tips.",

Coding it will be key to a lot of future assignments, but event if you write it in pseudo code it can help you break it down, and get you points you might not get if you didn't do anything at all or even help for it entirely. Which language is it in? Could you ask chatgpt to explain it and how to use pointers. I'd you cheat and have it write it for you, you do yourself a disservice as linked lists is that first link in a long chain.",

I took an OO database theory course and it was like everything clicked. Also not all TAs or advisors will help equally. Some are bad at their job, some excel. Find people in your class and see who they think is most helpful, if nobody in your class will help. Sometimes grouping up can help, if anybody is willing to help, ask someone who finished the assignment to go over it with them. Otherwise if you can't outline/type out the assignment that's already written down, then no one can help. What is the topic you're learning in class?",

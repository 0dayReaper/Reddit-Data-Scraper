As for the course, doesn\u2019t seem to be overly difficult, but you\u2019ll need to dedicate some time to it.\n\nAs for being a TA, if you are in undergrad, the pay is only around $20/hr. At first, the position isn\u2019t overly stressful as you are leading a few seminars, but come closer to midterms and assignments being due, it\u2019ll definitely test your patience. If you\u2019re in undergrad while being a TA, you\u2019ll have to really balance your workload, because it\u2019ll be really easy to fall behind.",

    "postText": "So I applied to Brock back in November, I was accepted within a couple days. The programs I applied to were Business Admin and Accounting. Since Business admin was ranked higher than accounting on my choices they sent the offer for BA. The problem I have is I now want to do accounting. Would I be able to decline the offer for BA and wait for a response for accounting??\n\nNote: I did email Brock a while ago about this and no response so far.\n\nI also emailed OUAC and they referred me to Brock for more information",

I don't know the requirements for those particular programs, but as long as you qualify for accounting, there won't be an issue switching. \n\nBut do it soonish (like in the next couple of months), so it's taken care of before course registration in July. Some courses only allow majors to register so you want it all done before that time comes.",

The system will pick up that change and we\u2019ll consider you for the top choice.\n\nNo need to worry about emailing admissions, and certainly don\u2019t wait to transfer programs next year.\n\nPlease keep in mind the OUAC closes for the holidays, and so does Brock, so you may not see the new offer until January.",

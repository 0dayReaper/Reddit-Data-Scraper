            "comment": "So, my first year back into Uni after 10 years of work force, only college experience prior, I was technically bumped to second year due to transfer credits. Anyways, Theories of Pop Culture was my Gillespie class first semester. It was tough, hitting the ground running with no previous Uni experience, my first two essays I got dinged for a few minor things really hard. Tough marker. But then I used it as a challenge to write really good essays and ended up with a lot of 80-90 marks on the WEEKLY essays. I liked it, got an 82.  \n\n\nThe final book report worth 30% was to write a review of Cynical Theories, by crazed conspiracy theorist James Lindsay. The book came out before the US election, so just before he really went off the deep end, so it wasn't TOO bad. Basically the book shits on social justice. It's not bad, it probably contains the most logical arguments against the more far fringe aspects of left wing politics in the west. I chose to write a positive book review because it just seemed easier, given the prof's leanings, etc. Gillespie is a James Lindsay type, basically you should be able to wear whatever the hell you want to a school Halloween event because you know, kilts and stuff.  \n\n\nAnyways... aside from all that. He gives a lot of work, he's a tough marker, and academic advisors and other professors know this. I've been steered away from his courses twice this year without me mentioning him.   \n\n\nTLDR: He's a tough marker, kinda anti-woke, gives a lot of work, comes off as a jerk to most. Steer clear unless you want a real good academic challenge.",

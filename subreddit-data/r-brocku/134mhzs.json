    "postText": "Tuition is due today for me but I\u2019m waiting for Brock to confirm my enrolment so that OSAP can pay out my grant to Brock. Does anyone know what happens when you leave overdue tuition on your account and how long until they start to charge interest? \n\nI can\u2019t pay my tuition until my enrolment is confirmed with OSAP, but my marks haven\u2019t been confirmed yet so just still waiting. \n\nIf anyone could help me out here I would appreciate it, when do spring/summer courses start? I\u2019m doing co-op and my placement starts May 8th so I don\u2019t have classes but I need to pay for the co-op stuff",

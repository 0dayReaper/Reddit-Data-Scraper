    "postText": " This just came in:\n\nBrock is known across Canada for its scenic campus and unparalleled student experience. It\u2019s what makes the University such a great place to learn, teach and work, and it\u2019s part of the reason Brock is [ranked so highly for student experience](https://brocku.ca/brock-news/2020/10/brock-retains-top-national-ranking-for-mental-health-support-and-climbs-in-student-satisfaction-cross-canada-reputation/) in the *Maclean\u2019s* rankings of Canadian universities each year.\n\nAs the region, province and country continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, Brock is planning a return to campus for the Fall Term, with classes offered primarily on campus and residence, dining and campus life services returning to normal operations.\n\n\u201cThe University\u2019s top priority remains ensuring a high-quality academic and student experience, with the knowledge that many students are eager to return to campus as soon as it is safe to do so,\u201d says Brock University President Gervan Fearon. \u201cOur students tell us the Brock experience and campus engagement are an important part of their education and personal development. We are doing everything to ready Brock to welcome students back on campus.\u201d\n\nBrock is planning to offer as many courses on campus as possible, including labs and other experiential learning, graduate seminars and undergraduate classes. It will mean the much-anticipated return to on-campus learning, teaching and working. The University is preparing for the gradual return of community programs such as access to fitness facilities and events.\n\nThe University also plans to have its eight residences fully operational, returning to near-full capacity and ready to receive students. These include a variety of options, such as traditional dormitory-style and semi-suite rooms, as well as townhouses and housing suitable for upper-year and graduate students. Dining services will return to normal and academic supports such as the James A. Gibson Library and on-campus computer labs will be available.\n\n\u201cWhat incoming and returning students to Brock will see when they arrive back on campus is a truly enhanced and upgraded version of the University,\u201d says Lynn Wells, Provost and Vice-President, Academic.\n\nJust before the global pandemic forced all classes to move online in March 2020, the University opened its striking new front entrance and collaborative space, the Rankin Family Pavilion.\n\nOver the past year, a number of significant construction projects and campus enhancements have continued. These include: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Residence      8, a brand new on-campus residence that increases Brock\u2019s capacity to      nearly 2,800 beds\n* DeCew      Residence, a massive renewal project on Brock\u2019s largest residence building\n* The      Zone, the on-campus fitness centre, which has tripled in size and been      updated with more than 15,000 square feet full of modern equipment\n* A new      Starbucks in Guernsey Market\n* A new      full-service Tim Hortons located in the Walker Complex\n* Two      newly renovated dining halls in residences and the launch of an      all-you-care-to-eat dining program.\n* The      ongoing construction of Canada Games Park, a massive arena and recreation      complex being built on Brock land ahead of the 2022 Canada Summer Games\n\nBrock will ensure a Fall Term that prioritizes on-campus experience and is respectful of public health guidelines. Brock will also strive to offer a portion of online and hybrid courses. These will appeal not only to students who may not yet feel safe returning to campus, but also to those who have come to appreciate the flexibility and other benefits of online instruction.\n\nThe University will continue to share additional information as it becomes available in the next months.\n\nMessage sent by \n\n**Brock University Communications**\n\nLocated at Mackenzie Chown A 205\n\n[universitycom@brocku.ca](mailto:universitycom@brocku.ca)",

I'm hoping they didn't put this out to push enrollment, and they really do intend to find a way for at least more classes to be in person.",

They could\u2019ve easily waited. \n\nLots of my peers were stuck in leases for this exact same reason for when the university was one of the last to confirm winter 2020/2021 being online. Thank god I procrastinated the decision",

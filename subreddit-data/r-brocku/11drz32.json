    "postText": "So I am a grade 12 students who will be attending Brock in September. I will be studying accounting.   \nMy school offers various AP courses which you can then choose to take an exam for in May, as I'm sure is the same for many other schools in Ontario. One of the AP courses I'm taking is AP English, does anyone know if Brock considers giving a credit for AP english? From what I have seen it's more maths and sciences. To add, if they do would it be worth it? For context I am pretty confident in my writing abilities but not too confident about the 50 multiple choice.",

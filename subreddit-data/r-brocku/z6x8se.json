It's just been a waste of my time so I read the power points 5x faster outside of class and do the assignments.\n\nAs the semester's gone on I've gotten more comfortable skipping those classes as I become more certain I'm not missing anything, I imagine I'm not the only one with this approach.",

A lot of profs will give extra hints about the exam to the stragglers that make the effort to attend lecture. They also make mental notes of your attendance and if you have concerns about grades, they use it in their determination to help you out. It\u2019s most definitely worth your time attending lectures and those help sessions if available, even if you feel confident. You\u2019ll be surprised how you often get rewarded for it",

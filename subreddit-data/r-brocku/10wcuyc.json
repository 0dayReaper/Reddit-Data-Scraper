You might\u2019ve gotten an email about this from your academic advisor, if not, the dates are always listed on https://brocku.ca/important-dates/\n\nYou can however withdraw from a course, but you will not get the money back that you already paid for it. This just gets you out of failing the course and you will see a \u201cWD\u201d for withdrawal on the \u201ccourses and marks\u201d section of your portal. Important to note that if you currently taking the minimum amount of credits to stay full time (1.5 credits) and you drop below that (say to 1 credit because your dropped a .5 credit course), you will be charged an additional fee.",

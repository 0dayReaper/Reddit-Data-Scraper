    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am a fourth-year enrolled full-time for the fall/winter semester, but I can't finish my term. Essentially I had an injury prior to the beginning of the term. and it got soo bad that I couldn't walk past 1 minute and I can't sit because of the pain. Naturally, I need to go to the doc but my family is not in the country... long story short: I can't do school work. I was wondering If and how I could withdraw from my classes this semester but still be able to comeback next semester, hoping my health improves.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated it.",

If you are able to go to campus, I highly recommend going to Brock Central. I also recommend booking an appointment with your academic advisor so you can come up with a plan for your return. Generally, admin staff is very understanding and will help but you just have to ask",

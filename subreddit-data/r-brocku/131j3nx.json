    "postText": "Is BrockU Cs Program That Bad?\n\nI got accpeted into brock and Yorku for their cs program but I\u2019m super broke so I was thinking about going to brock instead but I haven\u2019t heard anything good about the program. Is it worth working a full-time job and attending Yorku instead or should i go to brock for a year to save up and transfer after?\n\nBackground info:\nI live in st catharine, around 20 mins away from Brock and i\u2019m currently working to save up some money. \n\nThank you guys!",

            "comment": "I don't think you're going to be that far ahead going to York instead of Brock. They're about the same level \"prestige-wise\". Brock is a great school, and beyond your first job, no one will ask you where you went to school (if even that). But prestige is bullshit anyways. It matters a lot less where you went to school, and more what you did during your time there. Did you study hard, make connections, join clubs, etc.?  Plus, you're gonna save a lot more money just from not moving, let alone moving to Toronto.",

However I have heard some actual bad things about Brock\u2019s comp sci program\u2026 bad to the point where it might actually be wise not coming here. You\u2019re right, the degree granting institution doesn\u2019t matter, but the things I\u2019ve read is that there is not a whole lot of teaching. It\u2019s very self taught with high expectations. I don\u2019t know how yorks program compares but if it\u2019s a better learning environment I think it could be worth going there.",

It is true that a lot of the coding is self taught, but coding is really only part of computer science. Computer science is about learning how computers work on a fundamental level, and while that includes coding, there is a lot more to it. For example last year I took theory of computation, which dove more into the mathematical representation of computational systems, and included zero coding. Besides, any job you get in the tech industry will require you to teach yourself how their technology works, so developing the skills to be self taught like that is very valuable.",

            "comment": "With CS, companies care exponentially more about your projects than your program. Interviews will often (if not ALWAYS) revolve around your ability to solve problems they provide you, and they want to see that you have a unique and *extensive* portfolio of experiences. Developing personal projects is a must. Don't worry about prestige of a school.",

            "comment": "Would not recommend Brock CS. Barring the fact that the CS program here teaches with dated and archaic lessons, the TAs who are half the time either clueless or just don't give a shit, professors who have a stuck up attitude, the program barely retains any people over the years. \n\nThe other commenters are valid in the assessment in that prestige as a university is not a big factor, side projects and your practical knowledge are gonna be the biggest things for finding a good job/internship. However, York is located basically in downtown Toronto, a massive tech hub in Ontario whereas St Catharines is practically in the middle of nowhere.  You have a much greater chance of finding meaningful and applicable jobs or internships going to York imo. Along with better networking opportunities.\n\nThis comes from someone who was in Brock CS and switched out after second year. I don't think the program at Brock is worth your money or time. You could genuinely learn more practical and useful information online since all they teach you here is shit nobody would ever use irl or outside of research. Feel free to dm me with more questions if you'd like, but plz don't come to brock for CS. Learn from my mistakes",

    "postText": "I'm a proud parent of a soon-to-be Brock Badger, and while my daughter is handling almost everything regarding this exciting new move in September, we parents are footing the bill :)So I'm trying to financially plan ahead for things that she might need in residence and what to buy. Rather not run around like a crazy person in the last two weeks of August trying to get everything, all at once.Daughter is hoping to have a single room.\n\nSo, I have a few questions that I hope you experienced students won't mind answering?\n\n\\- are the res rooms typically cold or warm? (will multiple or heavy blankets be needed in the winter)\n\n\\- is a fan in the room a good idea?\n\n\\- is the room lighting good/bad, should she bring in a desk lamp, twinkle lights, all that?\n\n\\- is a desk chair provided (and it is actually comfortable), or can she bring in her own?\n\n\\- we assume washrooms are shared (daughter is currently a lifeguard so she is comfortable with gym showers, etc), but anything in particular to be aware of there?\n\nAnd any tips on how she might improve her chances on getting a single room?  (She is still studying hard to keep up her good marks because apparently Brock's room selection goes by grade average, which I think is brilliant btw).\n\nAnd I've been reading previous posts about residence and send a big thank you for all the information being shared. It is so helpful.\n\nEditing to add another question: do most students buy a fridge for res rooms, or is there a company that rents them by term? Thanks again.",

            "comment": "My experience in Lowenberger:\n\nBring a heavy blanket, but they might not use it. Rooms are very inconsistent with their temperature but can get pretty warm.\n\nFor those same reasons I\u2019d recommend a fan. \n\nLighting is fine but I\u2019d recommend a desk lamp regardless just to be safe.\n\nAs for a desk chair there is one provided and it\u2019s honestly pretty decent. \n\nShowers (in my residence) are shared with 2 other people (attached to another room) and they\u2019re fine. I\u2019ve had to problems with point out hygiene issues to other people so cleanliness hasn\u2019t been much of a problem for me, but could be for others. \n\nAs for the mini fridge situation you just rent them and the university will have it in your room on move in day. \n\nIf you have any follow up questions feel free to reply.",

            "comment": "I live in Lowenberger double and I have seen the singles in Lowe and all other residences. \n\n1. I would say the rooms are typically warm, I remember moving in in September and it was so incredibly hot. Also on warm sunny days in the winter they will not turn off the heat which means the rooms can sometimes be extremely hot. I would say my room temperature averages between 21-22C and I leave my window slightly open at night for cool air. I would 100% recommend a fan. Another thing is most residences allow you to adjust the temperature via a thermometer however in Lowenberger this isn\u2019t possible. \n\n2. I have found that all rooms except those in Valle and Village are pretty well naturally lit however the main lights are extremely harsh and so I would recommend a desk lamp. \n\n3. Chairs are provided and I honestly don\u2019t find them bad at all. She can bring her own chair however the chair they give you will have to stay in the room. Additionally, fabric chairs are not allowed. \n\n4. For the bathroom situation your daughter will probably be fine. If she\u2019d rather leave her bathroom stuff in the bathroom she\u2019ll want to go for any residence other than Decew. In Decew bathroom are in a communal area and shared between stairwells. \n\n5. If her average is above a 90 she is guaranteed her first pick residence room. Other than that the only ways to really higher your chances would be to rank all the single options above doubles since you don\u2019t rank by actually residence building but rather by residence style. \n\n6. In terms of getting a fridge I think it\u2019s a good idea to actually see if she\u2019ll need one since you could easily get away without one especially since you aren\u2019t allowed any kind of appliances in the semi suites rooms. I ended up buying a tiny little skincare fridge off Amazon to store some juices and that has worked out great for me. There\u2019s not a huge amount of room in the rooms so I definitely say a mini fridge is something you should wait and see if it\u2019s needed before purchasing. \n\nYou mentioned seeing other posts about residences, I\u2019ve written a pretty detailed guide on the residences which I can send you if you haven\u2019t seen already!",

            "comment": "I lived in Quarry View and found that it was either super hot or super cold, depending on the time of year and how my roommates and I had set the thermostat. I had multiple blankets (a comforter, a thin sheet, and then a few fuzzy blankets) and I found that i used them the majority of the time, but I\u2019m also just always freezing. I would definitely recommend a desk light, yes, but she may not have anywhere to hang/plug in twinkle lights. Desk chairs are provided but they\u2019re very waiting room-y. They\u2019re decent, and I found that if I covered mine with a fuzzy blanket or sat on a pillow I was fine. She can bring her own if she\u2019d rather. Quarry view has two bathrooms - one with just a toilet and stall shower on the main floor, and one with a shower/tub combo and a toilet on the second basement floor (there are three rooms on the bottom floor and one on the top). I quite loved the bathroom, especially since my roommates and I were all really good with keeping it clean. I\u2019d recommend bringing a shower caddy she can easily leave a cupboard or bring back and forth from her own room to the bathroom, toothbrush/toothpaste holder, hand soap, toilet paper, hand towels, and a bath mat. The bath mat isn\u2019t needed but it adds a bit of pizzazz and homeliness to the bathroom. I feel like the hand soap, toilet paper and hand towel are obvious but it was one of those things that any of my roommates if I thought to bring so we had to run out and grab it the day we moved in. I would also recommend maybe a shoe mat of some kind, especially for wet and salty shoes in the winter.",

Same goes for a fan (a small one that can fit on the desk is ideal to save space)\n\n3. Desk chair is provided (though can say for certain they arent the comforts desk chair)\n\n4. Lighting is usually pretty good regardless of where bit many people still bring a small lamp or twinkling lights for *aesthetic*\n\nHope this helps",

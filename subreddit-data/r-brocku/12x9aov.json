            "comment": "When I took it as a spring course it wasn\u2019t too bad. I liked the content but there was A LOT of reading and long lecture notes- more than I expected. there was also lots of forum posts and you also had to reply to someone\u2019s post for full marks each week. I believe the exam was open book which is good but again lots of notes from the lectures the prof posted on Sakai so made it hard to synthesize everything and look through during the exam. It could\u2019ve just been this profs way of teaching so your prof may be different. I ended with a 74. My class was also through Covid when class was online so it may be different if it\u2019s in person for you. :)",

We had 6 quizzes (all on Fridays I believe), and the rest of the grade was based on a term paper, which includes an annotated bibliography, and a peer review assignment.\n\nI did absolutely shit on the paper but still finished with above 80. The class wasnt that hard",

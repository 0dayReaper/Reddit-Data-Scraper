            "comment": "I\u2019m not sure this is the format for every program. But, basically: graduate fellowship from brock changes with masters to PhD. Research fellowship if you\u2019re in a research based program can be more money from your prof. Then you have TA contracts to fill out the rest. I think on average before tuition (which I\u2019m pretty sure a lot of other schools don\u2019t make grad students pay) is maybe around 20K",

            "comment": "Masters Student here (MSc AHS)\n\nFellowship funding is to assist you in completing your studies by providing funding, with the amount differing between Masters and PhD as well as Domestic and International. At Brock, fellowship funding automatically applies to your Brock account before being transferred to your personal bank account. That being said, it will apply to your fees first, so with it along with the other funding, you\u2019ll typically have a decent amount left over (more if you recieve OSAP, but it gets messy sometimes). It\u2019s split evenly over Fall/Winter/Spring so you don\u2019t get it all at the same time.\n\nAs for TA, you automatically get assigned classes during your first year. Unfortunately, it tends to be less than spectacular courses your first go-around, but as for pay, it\u2019s biweekly straight to your bank account. It\u2019s typically 120 hours split over 9 payments, with it being around $430 on average. You can request more hours but you need approval from multiple individuals.",

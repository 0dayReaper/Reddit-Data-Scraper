I think I came across your post yesterday and you have great experiences as well that are a plus point. COVID was a really challenging time and the fact that you still remained close to your previous average is commendable \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd Just like you, COVID was a pretty difficult time for me as well. I was in an entirely new city, trying to help manage my parents\u2019 new business and then my uncle (who I was very close to) passed away. My grades suffered so much because of it\n\nI think they\u2019ll be lenient considering that your grades changed during COVID! Although I\u2019m not sure how admissions work for masters programs, you can probably get in with your high GPA, great experiences and the circumstances not being in your favour. \n\nAs of right now, I\u2019m considering a lot of options. I\u2019m thinking about doing my masters one day then the next, I want to apply to med/dental/pharmacy school to see if I have a shot. Life\u2019s so much harder after graduation \ud83d\ude43",

You could definitely get in but it\u2019ll just be more effort if you\u2019re up for it. If you\u2019re still interested after your masters too, I\u2019ve seen people apply and get in easier (it might even be a little better since a lot of med/dental schools in Ontario are increasing the total number of postgrad seats). \n\nEven if you did a 5th year, how do you know things wouldn\u2019t have gotten worse?

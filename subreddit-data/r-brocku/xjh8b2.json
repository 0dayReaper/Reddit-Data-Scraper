    "postText": "Hi I'm a first year at brock university and my program is computer science. I chose all my courses and one of the courses was HIST 1P91 for my humanities credit. I'm currently in the middle of the course and I'm not liking it so far, I was wondering if it is possible to drop the course for a different course that will still give me my humanities credit or is it too late? I really like music so I tried searching up music courses that will count as a humanities credit and I found that MUSI 1P50 and 1P55 count as a humanities credit. So am I able to transfer to that class?",

You'll need to do it today though, I believe tomorrow is the last day to switch without academic penalty. \n\nThat said, be aware that you'll be behind, and it will be on you to get caught up. Also, before you drop the class, make sure you can get into the other class you're interested in. The other option is to drop the course and make it up in the spring/summer/another year. If the credit isn't made up in the spring, you may end up being delayed for year 2 registration, which can mean not getting into necessary courses.",

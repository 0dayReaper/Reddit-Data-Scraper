But also the highest average mark semester I had at Brock so far xD.\n\nI\u2019d be shocked if they ever allowed someone to do seven. However, if you\u2019re unemployed I think it is doable, just expect it to be your entire world for three-ish months. Like, you don\u2019t have to say goodbye to your friends but your weekends will be all tied up (if you hope to do well in every class).",

I also made sure to religiously follow a good sleep schedule, as being tired creates cascading chaos.",

However, if I took it easy a few days work would pile up and catching up on that was where burnout would occur for me. So I actively try to prevent it, and have been successful, so I would disagree with you.\n\nFor context, I've been doing full-time school and full-time job since Sept 2021, with only a break in August 2022, and so far avoided burnout.",

If you\u2019re trying to get them out of the way and don\u2019t care about the marks you get, I would recommend it. \n\nHowever if you have a job, want to maintain a social life, want to sleep 8 hours a night and have time for other career-related activities, stick to 4-5 courses. \n\nThe most time you\u2019ll save from doing 7 courses a semester is one year. If you need a high GPA and want to pursue higher education, you\u2019ll spend another couple of years trying to make up for rushing through your undergrad.",

Spend your second semester getting a job in your field. You\u2019ll get a head start and be more favored since you\u2019re job searching at a time when students are busy with school. \n\nWish you the best no matter what decision you make tho! \u2764\ufe0f",

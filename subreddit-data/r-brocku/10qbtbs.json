    "postText": "I decided to take this course as an elective and I\u2019m beginning to regret it big time. Our first assignment is due on Friday and I genuinely have no idea how to even start it. I really wish the professor would\u2019ve given us at least some refresher on the 1P02 material, but I guess it\u2019s on me for not taking this course until 2 years after.\n\nAnyone else really worried?",

            "comment": "COSC 1P03 is the followup to 1P02. If you haven't done 1P02 in a while, it will be much more difficult to do well in 1P03 without a programming background. 1P03 builds upon 1P02 and it will only get harder from here. There are multiple supports - including the help desk - but in the end, programming comes down to problem solving. Break the problem into the simplest steps you can - start without even trying to put it into code, start with simple steps. What needs to be accomplished? What needs to be done in each step of the program? What does the list need to hold? What needs to be done to what's the in the list? How does the information get into the list? As a comp sci major, I could definitely help you but you need to break it down into something you can work with (pseudocode even if you can). Start with the beginning and slowly work your way to the end",

My issue is that I just don\u2019t remember how to solve the problems I need to in Java, nor do I remember how to effectively use things like Turtle graphics or Brock\u2019s own packages. I understand the array stuff no problem, it\u2019s the other stuff that\u2019s dragging me down. I wish I\u2019d taken this class sooner, I\u2019d have gotten more out of it.",

As well, many of the lab PDFs have links to relevant documentation references (or refer to your old notes from 1P02 if you still have them)",

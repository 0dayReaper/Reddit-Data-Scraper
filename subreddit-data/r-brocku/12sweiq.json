    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a first year eng student from TMU and was looking to transfer to Brock in the fall since I'm moving to St. Catharines. \n\nDue to a number of extenuating circumstances, including domestic issues which resulted in me moving, my gpa isn't great, around 1.6. I was on a probationary contract at TMU because I couldn't focus on my schoolwork at all.\n\nMy question is: what are the chances of me getting into literally any program at Brock with a low gpa but high 90s highschool marks? \n\nThe programs I'd like to get into are math &amp; stats or accounting, but again I'd be willing to transfer into anything then try to get into these programs later on. \n\nAny feedback would be highly appreciated!",

I've heard that they take pretty much anybody immediately after applying, and that there are a lot of people on academic probation in the program since it's very forgiving.\n\nFrom there, you would mirror the courses of the program you're interested in, and then could hopefully transfer to an upper year. Speak to an academic advisor! They are very helpful and may be able to ease your worries.",

            "comment": "I more or less got in after a similar-ish situation. I'd failed out of Western due to some issues, but I had previously okay marks from Fanshawe, and high school. I applied to Brock under the \"mature student\" status, which is for folks over 21 and starts you as a part-time student until you complete 2.0 credits, then goes to full-time (but I got an 87% average in my first 1.0, and was allowed to go full-time early).\n\nI didn't have the prerequisites for the Business Admin program (Goodman's BBA), so I started as General Humanities, and then did each of the pre-req courses that're required to transfer into BBA (in that case, ECON 1P91, ECON 1P92, MATH 1P97 and STAT 1P98; however I also didn't have the pre-reqs for MATH 1P97 so I did MATH 1P20 also). Then I got admitted into BBA (which I finish this July).\n\nI don't know if you'd qualify as a Mature Student, since it sounds like you'd passed some courses at TMU, might be stuck with the 'Transfer Student' category. (I completed courses at Fanshawe College, which should've excluded me from Mature Student status, but Brock let me use that status anyway). I found this PDF, with the \"University Transfer Average\" acceptance criteria (in letter grades). General Humanities is a C-, and Accounting is a C, and Accounting Co-op is a B-.  \n[https://brocku.ca/admissions/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/Admissions-Criteria.pdf](https://brocku.ca/admissions/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/Admissions-Criteria.pdf)\n\nSo, if you can't transfer into your ideal program, you could probably get into Gen. Humanities, then just get good marks in the pre-req courses that're required to transfer to something else. To find out what those pre-reqs are, just Google \"brocku course calendar\" with the program name, and then on the course page look for any transfer information (as in, existing Brock student transferring from a different Brock program into that program).",

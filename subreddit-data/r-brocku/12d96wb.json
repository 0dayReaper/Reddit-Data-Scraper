    "postText": "hey guys I accidentally submitted a rough draft of my final essay for a class instead of my good copy, unfortunately I wasn\u2019t able to to remove the submission and resubmit (only one submission was allowed, usually this isn\u2019t the case). \n\nmy rough draft didn\u2019t have page numbers, there was some extra spaces between sources on my works cited and lastly there were two point form notes I left for myself on the last page that weren\u2019t removed. luckily the notes weren\u2019t weird they were normal.\n\nI realized this before the due date, and emailed my TA with the good copy as fast as I could, still before the due date.\n\nthis was clearly a simple mistake, I just named both copies too similar to each other I guess. Is this completely my fault, do you guys think my TA or prof will be sympathetic towards me? should I just take the L and move on?\n\n\nthis has literally never happened to me before so I feel like I\u2019m spiraling. I\u2019m so overwhelmed I actually worked hard on this essay and it would suck if I lost significant marks over an honest mistake.",

I did the same thing and my prof just told me to re-submit the correct one as soon as possible but it had to be IDENTICAL to the one in the email. Im sure the same will happen with you.",

Unless your TA is a psycho he will grade the stuff you sent in an email.\n\nEven if you did I seriously doubt he would take off many marks. It seems like the content of the essay is still there.\n\nBelieve it or not most of the staff at Brock want you to do well and get a good mark if you deserve it.",

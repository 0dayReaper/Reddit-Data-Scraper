    "postText": "So I graduated this fall in biological sciences and I\u2019m trying to figure out what I wanna do since my original plan is no longer achievable lol. I have been interested in some masters programs specifically public health and applied health sciences. I was going to apply soon as I know the deadline is mid feb. Also a gap year isn\u2019t really helping me besides paying off my loan, and as I\u2019m 23 I already feel like time is passing and I need to start a program. I know there are easier schools but I would like to stay at Brock if possible as I love the school. \n\nThe only issue is my grades. Most require a min 75 in your last two years. My first two years of study i had 80s and my overall average is 77, but my last two years are on the lower end of the 70s. This is just due to online school and depression during lockdown. I couldn\u2019t really do online school. I should\u2019ve taken a 5th year or a year off during covid instead of now, but by the time I realized I could do a 5th year my degree was conferred.  hindsight is 20/20 I guess :/\n\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone has gotten into masters programs with low 70s? Is brock really competitive? I know many schools require a min 70. They say they value job experience but i don\u2019t really have research experience. My jobs are pharmacy assistant, supervisor at Starbucks, worked security at a hospital and also have volunteered for St. John ambulance and at elementary schools. Would this help? Also, many require references. Do these have to be from a prof? I haven\u2019t ever done research with profs nor do I think any would really remember me. Can I use managers, etc?",

            "comment": "Hey, \n\nMSc AHS student here. When it comes to the grades situation, it\u2019s definitely program dependant. Given public health is 1 year, your probability of getting in higher, but one issue with it is that you mentioned was not liking online when the Masters of Public Health is for the most part online. I would possibly communicate with the program coordinator to talk about the likelihood of getting in. The deadline for MPH is Feb 1st\n\nIn Applied Health Sciences, it\u2019s a lot more competitive and complicated. Because it\u2019s funded, for the most part, you\u2019ll need to lock down a grad supervisor or at least have a couple that may take you on. If you haven\u2019t started looking for possible supervisors, I would start ASAP and booking meetings to talk to them because a good portion will have already had meetings or finalized who they want to take on. Grades definitely matter for this program but if you are able to find a supervisor who is willing to work with you, your chance at acceptance is much higher.\n\nBest of luck with your applications!!",

Online school kinda ruined me, it wasn\u2019t so much it being online but I was just dealing with depression etc being locked down if that makes sense. Wasn\u2019t a good time in my life. I had low to mid 80s first two years",

            "comment": "I think it depends how serious it is and if you\u2019ve done it before too. You\u2019d probably get a stern talking to the first time, or they\u2019d send you straight onto academic probation and have you attend workshops and stuff. If you did it again you\u2019d be expelled. They definitely don\u2019t mess around with it. I knew a girl a few years ago who sent her essay to her friend to help her, and her friend copied it all. They both got in trouble obviously. The girl I knew had a meeting with the dean and stuff. \nPlease if you\u2019re thinking of plagiarizing, do not even take the risk. It\u2019s better to send your own work in half done than plagiarize. I remember in undergrad being super nervous about accidental plagiarism (forgetting to cite something or forgetting to change into my own words). Many classes give you a sample turnitin try so you can submit it and check your percentage first, and if the percentage is high you have the chance to fix it. But yeah definitely don\u2019t even risk it. Get an extension or take the L. But for the love of god for anyone reading this don\u2019t plagiarize. It\u2019s so not worth it. It ruins careers and peoples credibility.",

Later, we were informed by the prof that there\u2019ll be a committee to investigate the case. If the committee finds you guilty, you either receive the punishment or appeal to the Supreme Court.

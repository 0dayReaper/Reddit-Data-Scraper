    "postText": "Brock undergrads can study away AFFORDABLY for a semester or year through the National Student Exchange. Choose from over 160 campuses across the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, or U.S. Virgin Islands. NSE is affordable...you'll actually continue to pay Brock tuition and only pay for room/board, books, and course fees at your host campus. See your campus options at NSE.org.\n\nApplications are being accepted now. Contact Jayne for more information: [intlmobility@**brocku**.ca](mailto:intlmobility@brocku.ca).",

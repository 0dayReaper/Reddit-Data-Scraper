I\u2019m just so shocked that they\u2019re having all these people back, and on top of that vaccines aren\u2019t required. I feel like if they\u2019re not requiring vaccines they should at least give people the option to go online. I just still am in disbelief that we\u2019re all gonna be back in September while many places are still in lockdown. How can thousands of staff and students go back right now as we\u2019re still in a pandemic? I\u2019m so confused whether to sign a lease right now or just wait til more information is released.",

My experience may be very different as I am taking all 4th year and up courses so the number attending are already super low.\n\nAs for lockdowns, with dofo's schedule Ontario will be mostly open well before we start again, though I think it is important to point out that it is far easier for the administration to assignment classrooms to classes now and immediately switch to full online than it is to do the opposite in the event that we have to.",

No vaccine requirements means that you'll have a large portion of students who don't want to get vaccinated and they just...won't. Even with vaccines, they're 90% effective so that's 1/10 and thousands of students to spread to. It's only a matter of how long Brock can stay open in-person.",

A 95% efficacy rate means that in 95% of lab studied cases the desired outcome, which was preventing any lab tested spread. These vaccines are virtually 100% effective at preventing symptomatic spread. So long as Brock is vaccinated roughly in line with Provincial numbers, it should be enough to break the chain of transmission and prevent a major outbreak.",

While it's true that high number of vaccines would help slow the spread, I legitimately doubt that all students will get the vaccine. Even during online classes I have encountered many students who said they had no intention of getting vaccinated. \n\nBottom line, is that we can hope for the best but should prepare for the worst.

You're a masters student and so you must know exactly how first year students think, act, and behave. They're going to make bad decisions. They're going to have big parties. They're going to break all the safety rules. You also know that a huge portion of the student population is first year students where half of them will fail out or quit by the end of their first year. \n\nI'm not saying it will cause \"a doomsday scenario\" but I have no faith that Brock's student (or even staff) population will all get vaccinated or make decisions that keep the community safe. I stand by what I first said that I estimate it'll be a 6-8 weeks before an outbreak and possible shutdown. It's the exact same amount of time that there was last year when they had very limited number of people on campus. There were outbreaks and issues within that time frame and that only had a fraction of the number of students on or around campus. This is going to be full residences and majority of students back on campus. This will not end well regardless of how good vaccines are or the provincial rate. \n\nI respect the fact that you have faith that things will work out but I cannot share that faith. I still hope for the best but I have to be prepared for the worst because the situation seems to be leaning more towards that scenario.",

We\u2019re paying enough good money to deserve our safety be guaranteed by the university. We also deserve as best an educational experience as can be achieved, which is admittedly harder to do during an evolving pandemic situation. \n\nMy hope is that the university is basing these moves to return to in person on the fantastic vaccination numbers Canada/Ontario has been hitting, but it\u2019s absolutely fair to be concerned, especially with the variants, and young peoples general proclivity to being reckless and conceited.

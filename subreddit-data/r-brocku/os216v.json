Assuming someone was gonna live in res and didn\u2019t have their first dose yet, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be 2 weeks past second dose by the time they\u2019re in res\n\nEdit: From the article: \n\n&gt;\tResidence students must have one dose prior to moving into their rooms on campus, and their second dose within 14 days of moving in.",

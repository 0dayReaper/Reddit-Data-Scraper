    "postText": "I\u2019m going into my first year of medical science and have the option to choose CHEM 1P91 for one whole day or three separate days with an hour each day. Anyone previously taken this class have any recommendations as to what time is better? Also how was DART 1P91 and DART 1P94 as electives? I\u2019m looking for an easy elective but also debating if I should take FILM 1F90 or INDG 1F90",

            "comment": "Honestly, it depends on when the class is. My chem classes were at 8am, and i was completely dead in the morning, and i missed quite a few lecture. So if you aren't a morning person i would recommend something in the afternoon.\n\n Also, pro tip for CHEM 1P91 &amp; 1P92, take a lab on a friday because after you do a lab you have to do a lab report, and those are due 2 school days after the lab. So you will technically be handing in the lab on Tuesday of the following week. \n\nAnd for your humanities course, i liked IASC 1F90 because i got to write many essays and forum posts, they kinda help you with writing and grammar. I found it useful taking that course because you will be writing lots of lab reports for your bio classes. I just finished my first year of med sci, if you need any help, feel free to dm or something.",

I would suggest the 3x1h lectures because we used to have in-class clicker questions on the lecture material (you have to review it beforehand in order to do well). I know some people who found the content difficult despite doing fine in gr12 chem so just a heads up",

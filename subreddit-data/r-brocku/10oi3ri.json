How many hours you get depends on your department. Typically you get 60 or 120 hours per semester, depending on how your courses are allocated and how many spots there are to go around in your department.",

The answer would come from the individual literally saying \u201cI\u2019m not trying\u201d everything else is an assumption. For example I would assume you\u2019re not trying to understand my message. Now, only you hold the true information on whether it\u2019s an inadequacy or lack of interest.",

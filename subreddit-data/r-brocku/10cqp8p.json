But you should know that Dr. Hodson does expect a good understanding on exams - typically he will have several long answers (sort of essay style, but not essay length), and not open book. So make sure you understand studies he covers, and that you can apply the stuff you learn - identify concepts in action, and be able to link relevant examples.",

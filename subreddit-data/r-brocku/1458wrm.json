    "postText": "hi everyone, I could really use some help deciding which course to take. If I take 2p35 im going to have a really heavy fall semester, but also don\u2019t want to be bored out of my mind taking 2p49. Neither are really my area of interest so that doesn\u2019t help either. If anyone has any information on how hard each of the classes are and any recommendation\u2019s i would greatly appreciate it! ",

Gave you modules to complete and each module had 2 parts, he\u2019d record the higher of the two marks and drop the lower. He also gives many hints about what\u2019s on the exam which I appreciated.",

I really liked the professor (Stephen Emrich) and would def love to take another course with him. For me, the course was not really hard and I did pretty well compared to all the other psych courses I had last semester. The information can be a bit boring but there were some parts that were interesting. What's nice is that the prof would take your highest two marks out of the 3 exams, so you can basically go for two exams only (which is what I did)! He gave out weekly quizzes that were similar to his multiple choice questions on the exams. The seminars were once every 2 weeks so its wasn't so heavy. They were okay and the assignments weren't really hard if you get the lectures. Overall, I liked the course!",

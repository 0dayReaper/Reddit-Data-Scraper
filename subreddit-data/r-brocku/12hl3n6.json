Them saying they'll take you on is way more impactful than you having a 79% average when the cutoff is 80% (though note, I wasn't doing an MAcc when I did this, so YMMV)\n\nIt's worth noting that a lot of people honestly just haven't bothered looking at that yet. It's the end of term and all the classes etc... are all coming to a head, so this is kind of the busiest time for a lot of the profs. If you're applying for a Fall start, you should probably hear back in a month or two.",

So basically nothing I said in my above comment will likely apply to you.\n\nOne of the main strains people do a masters in is a specifically research-based one (where you do a full research project under one of the main professors) and in that case, you would have likely needed to actually talk to some of the professors under there in order to get them to agree to actually \"supervise\" you.\n\nIn a class-based Masters (which sounds to me now like what you'll be doing) that probably isn't an issue. In which case, nothing I said really applies.\n\nThough not getting in yet isn't something I'd be that worried about. Right now is a super busy time for a lot of profs and so many likely just haven't bothered looking at it yet. It would be cause for concern if you were say, hoping for a May start (if applicable), but otherwise I wouldn't start stressing yet.",

Typically a lot of those in charge of saying yea or nay on your admission is also the profs who were teaching you to kind of okay you on higher-level classwork. \n\nSo it goes around to a bunch of other people who have a dozen other things to do to to sign off on it before you get an acceptance. And since a lot of those people are likely the other profs in the department, they have other stuff going on right now, it might get left at the bottom of a mailbox, etc...\n\nI applied for a January start for my MSc, and I didn't get out of \"under review\" until like, October-November, though it was considered kind of just a given and waiting for my application to really make the rounds. In a classwork-based MSc I'd be less willing to cut it that close though.",

I can't say for sure its the same for you.\n\nAt this point, I don't think it's that extreme to think the people in charge of your admission simply hasn't gotten around to it yet. Do you know anyone else also trying to go on a MAcc, or even a grad program in general? Finding someone else also applying could be a good way of measuring you getting in or not. I totally understand this being worrying, but its just kind of how it works (which yes, is kind of dumb).\n\nI would at least wait until a few weeks after exams are over to really be worried about it.",

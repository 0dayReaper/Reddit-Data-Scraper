    "postText": "hi, this is my first year at brock. i had an extremely hard time with the transition from high school to brock, i had a lot of medical issues at the very beginning of university too (sept-dec) and from my grades currently, no matter how well i do on my exams, i dont think ill be able to maintain the 70% average, i fall around a 68 average which means i will be dropped from the con ed program.\n\ni am aware that you have to take classes to try to boost your grade and get back in, but if i choose not to go back in the con ed program and just carry out my major, will it really matter? cant i just jump into a teachers college after university with my degree?\n\nhas anyone ever been dropped from the con ed program? what do i do? i am afraid lol",

            "comment": "You could just do an undergrad and apply to do a consecutive education program either at Brock or elsewhere.\n\nI'm not sure about your options right now, but just talk to an academic advisor. Don't stress, first year is super early and super flexible. Things happen, and it's better for you to learn things about yourself now rather than later",

            "comment": "If the end goal is to become a teacher, I would personally recommend staying in con Ed and working with your academic advisor. Doing an undergrad and teachers college separately is totally fine, but it is harder to get into teachers college now than it used to be. I\u2019ve heard of people not getting into certain teachers colleges that have good marks, or they were placed in a stream they didn\u2019t want. Con Ed is pretty sweet once you get to the end of your undergrad and realize you can take a breath and don\u2019t have to apply to teachers college. It really does save a headache. That\u2019s just my two cents, but if you feel dropping con Ed that\u2019s your choice and you gotta do what\u2019s best for you. Good luck!\n\nEdit- also being con Ed helps keep your teachables on track. Especially if you\u2019re in I/s, you need two teachables. So if you go down to undergrad and not con Ed, you need to make sure you fill elective spots with all the same subject to make a second teachable.",

If you're in P/J, not much will change, but if you're in J/I or I/S, you may have to take some extra courses.\n\nAs for whether you should reapply, I would recommend it unless you're planning to go to teachers college somewhere other than Brock.\n\nWhile you can get into teachers college either way, most teachers education programs will require a 70% average to get in (hence the con-ed requirement), so if you hope to do teachers college at Brock, getting back into the concurrent education program will save you trouble in applying later.\n\nWhatever you end up doing, I wish you luck :)",

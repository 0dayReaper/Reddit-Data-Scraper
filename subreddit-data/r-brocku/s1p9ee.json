    "postText": "i understand that the latest update as of recent is that we are going back to in-person January 31. but we all know, and the school knows, that this might not be possible due to the current situation. i don't live close to brock, so its not simple to just pack up and head to class for the day. if i go back January 31, ill drive for almost 4 hours, just to head back home a couple weeks later for reading week, and back again the week after. similarly, my classes are advertised as in person, but they're pretty hybrid. there's online components and in person components. so it makes going back feel a little pointless when half the time I'm doing stuff online anyways, but need to be there for little things. i seriously just want them to say hey guys sorry but the whole semester is online. then at least i can plan out my semester and stop worrying about if I'm going back or not. and if we do go back there's always the worry of being shut down again.  i am so stressed over this. I'm not eating properly, i feel depressed and hopeless. i dont know what to do. this uncertainty is not healthy for me. i cant take a semester off bc I've already been accepted to teachers college for fall of 2022. i just want a plan so i can have some comfort and start planning my life out. i know I'm not alone in this, but sometimes i feel like I'm in a dark hole laying there by myself and no ones knows.",

You're not alone, a lot of us feel the same way :( It's so frustrating when there's a limit on 5 people indoors but somehow labs of 20 is safe. And I don't understand how they've decided one month of online is enough when they predict that omicron will reach its peak in a month. Wish they would've at least provided a hybrid option so those who commute or have immunocompromised family members can stay home and still get their education.",

Other schools are announcing their plans or at least providing a date for when they will announce their plans. The high ups at Brock just seem content to sit around with their dicks in their hands without giving students any clarity let alone a voice in the decision making.",

Read that again.\n\n\"Planning\" is all well and good but pivoting is the real teacher.\n\nIsn't it boring to read/watch/experience something you already know...\nIt may be safe...make you feel good for knowing (false ego) but it won't teach you anything new.\nNot too much human growth in that space.\n\nMaking daily choices (with what is actual) in the present moment is all we truly have.\n\nWe are like everything else on this planet...from seed (cell) to \"growth\" to death.\n\nThis growth time...\nallow for what is (like the weather) and simply pay attention to your daily choices. \n\nThat is the best way to \"plan\" for the future.

They offer emergency sessions with a mental health nurse or you could set up an appointment for later. \n\nThey can help you withdraw from your courses even though the deadline has passed or possibly get the courses marked as \u201cincomplete\u201d to allow you to hand things in once you\u2019re ready. \n\nI know it can feel exhausting to try and get this done but it\u2019ll really take a burden off of your plate and from my experience the mental health nurses make it easy.\n\nClick [here](https://brocku.ca/health-wellness-accessibility/#shs-hours) for resources.",

It can trigger academic probation, but probation is really there as a safety net, a minor consequence they hope will nudge students to make changes. Main thing to remember is: you can't expect things to be different without doing something different. Funks don't end on their own.\n\nBrock is my 5th post-secondary school, three of the previous ones I failed out of due to different depressing circumstances. I only mention that to illustrate that there are avenues to recover from it and rebound. Even at Brock, during Covid in 2020/2021 I dropped all my classes as things were bad (but I graduate this July, yeehaw). Try your best to identify what's got you down or what threw you off, and also try to remember the spark that made you interested in your program in the first place. Losing that spark can make a person wonder why they're even trying, but if you re-experience that spark, it can re-cement your drive.",

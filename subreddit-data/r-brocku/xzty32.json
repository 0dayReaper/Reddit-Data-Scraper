Your best bet is to either find an apartment/ room off campus in the area and take the bus to school (full time students also get a bus pass to take the bus for free locally). In terms of socially speaking - I feel like you can get involved in campus clubs to be more social instead of wasting all that money for the \u201cfull university experience.\u201d - Hope this helps!",

I drive 25 minutes from my house to the Aldershot GO station and park my car there for the day and then hop on the bus. It beats having to drive an hour and a half to two hours to school every morning and waste my gas. Also, as a university student you get discounted bus fare pricing so really I only pay $6 one way to school so $12 daily which is really good.",

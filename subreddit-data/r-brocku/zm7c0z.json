I don\u2019t have the prerequisite yet but I am taking it next term and thought it would make sense for me to take both courses at the same time.\n\nEdit: The course I want to take is Econ2P21. I have already taken Econ1P91 but I don\u2019t yet have Math1P97.",

There is basic use of calculus and they review it before class anyways.",

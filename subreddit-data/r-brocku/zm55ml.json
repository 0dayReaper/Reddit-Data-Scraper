So I was wondering if there is a running track and who the track is open for.\nAdditionally, I thought about the social aspect mostly. Are there any clubs to join?",

There\u2019s a lot of clubs but for the social aspect you don\u2019t need to be in a club. I\u2019m a skateboarder and no club for that. But there\u2019s a ton of skateboarders by Brock so we all group up and skate together.",

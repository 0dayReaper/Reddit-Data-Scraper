    "postText": "Hi, I graduated this year in biological sciences and looking at trying to apply to the accelerated nursing program. No clue if I\u2019ll get in as my grades aren\u2019t the best but I would like to try, however, I need to take psych, anatomy, and a research methods course that I never took (wasn\u2019t needed for bio). \n\nI\u2019m wondering when spring and summer course list will be available. And if they are offered, anyone have experience taking them if you\u2019re not currently an undergraduate student? Thank you.",

So, just a couple weeks away.\n\nNo clue on the grad taking undergrad classes, I'd just call the office of the registrar Monday morning (I think it's like 10am-3pm) 905-688-5550 ext 3052",

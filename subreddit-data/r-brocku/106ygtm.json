    "postText": "I am very scared taking this course. Been a while since I did 1p02 and haven\u2019t kept up with coding since then. I keep hearing this is a super tough class. For those of you that have taken the class where you were very new to programming how difficult is this class? And is there a good crash course on 1p02 topics I can look into to prepare?\n\n\nAnd are there labs and tutorials in the first week?\n\n\n\n\nThanks",

If you do, get help asap either from brock, friends or elsewhere. assignments should be started minimum a week before they're due, the earlier the better. the midterm and final exams are heavily based on past exams (based on last semesters exams). study past papers and you will do well. it's not super hard once you get it. good luck and feel free to dm me",

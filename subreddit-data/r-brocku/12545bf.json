I applied to the master's program, however, since I haven't been accepted yet, I'm getting the feeling the admissions committee might offer me the GDAC program as an alternative offer.  If you could tell me anything, that would be amazing! Thanks :)",

            "comment": "Not 100% sure but I believe the biggest difference is the progression towards a CPA. The MAcc program takes you straight to the CFE as all of the prerequisites are met (Capstone 1 &amp; 2) whereas the GDAC (similar to WLU GDIP) would only take you past the electives etc so you would still have to do the capstones after the fact.\n\nIt really comes down to who you are doing capstones with, the peers you know at Brock assuming you took the BAcc or doing it with other people who are doing the PEP program. I wouldn\u2019t say there is a huge difference, (mainly the capstones, and the letters after your name) generally speaking though the MAcc will better prepare you for the CFE. If you don\u2019t end up getting into the MAcc I would still say it would be worth it to take the GDAC over going into PEP. Wish you all the best!",

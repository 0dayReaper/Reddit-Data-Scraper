    "postText": "Hello im currently transferring to Brock in the Fall and I am wondering if I go on residence (non-brock suites), are they going to put me on a floor with all upper years or will they treat me like everyone else who is going in first year? I don't mind either one, but I would like to be placed with first years as I am starting my first year in my program. Also, does Village or Quarryview require a meal plan ",

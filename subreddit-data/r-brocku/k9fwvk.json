You can enroll in the first year requirements for any major and if you get the required grades you can degree any social science, humanity or hard science major. You can even take the first year business classes and I've had 2 friends that switched into Goodman quite easily.\nI only know the three majors I've done (I was a double major psych and Bio and now I'm comp sci and bio) varied quite a bit. If you want to switch into bio you need to talk first year calculus and bio stats (I think they are MATH 1P96 and 1P97) and intro bio (BIO 1P91 and 1P92) and get at least a 60 in them. They are all pretty easy. \n\nIf you wanna switch into comp sci it's introduction to comp sci (COSC 1P02 and 1P03) and two math classes on logic and algorithm analysis (MATH 1P66 and 1P67) the COSC classes for first year are easy but they get way harder in second year. \n\nIf you wanna switch into psychology you just need PSYC 1f90. I was a TA for this last year and a lot of students struggle but you only need a 60 and then things get easier and super interesting (obviously I'm biased lol)\n\nJust google \"Brock undergraduate calender _____\" with whatever major you are interested in and you can see what the first year classes are and take them.\nThe world is your oyster.

            "comment": "Instructor weighing in. \n\nIt was very challenging. Even though all of my curriculum is organized online on Sakai, I always delivered it all in person. So, while the materials transition was easy, not having the human contact has been slowly killing me all term. I miss connecting with my students.\n\nFor the record, my Sakai set up is damn good. I'm a technologist and and a big humanist, so putting user experience first is my priority and I have the skills to do it well. All their learning was asynchronous, they could do the work on their own time at their own pace. My students were actually quite happy with the quality of my courses.\n\nI did run weekly live (synchronous) events as well. But these events were for playing virtual games together, like guess that song, or virtual checkers. Not a lot of attendance in those, but the ones who did join liked it. Just trying to create opportunities for students to connect online just to have some fun social time, not mandatory at all, just if you wanted to join.\n\nBut, it's been hard for a lot of the instructors too. I miss connecting with all my peers and colleagues as well. I'm stuck here at home for 90% of my life right now (excluding dog walks, bike rides, groceries...). Its hard when you have only one space for all your leisure and work. Blurred lines... to add to this I'm a father of four, so my house can get quite chaotic and messy (Family Circus). Campus has always been an escape from home for me, a place where I dont have to worry about laundry and dishes, I could focus on \"work me\" and enjoy that, go home to put on my Dad hat. Now I feel like I have both my hats on all the time and its confusing and difficult, for me.\n\nI'm so sorry for all the students with luddites for instructors. I'm sorry for those whose courses have become canned courses they dont feel engaged by. You all deserve better, and I can assure you there are many of us who strive to give you a quality learning experience.\n\nOn last thing. It's easier said than done. This too shall pass. Put in that work, if for nobody else but yourself. To make it good in life, you gotta trudge through some mud. Yeah, this mud is the deepest thickest funkiest mud I've ever seen too, but you can conquer this. And you can persevere. Life will get better.",

I'm a fourth-year student and I've usually had a pretty chill time with classes but I think everything that's going on in the world and the lack of face-to-face interaction with TA's and profs it's been a lot harder to perform. I think Brock and the faculty I have encountered are trying their best and I'm really happy to be here as opposed to a lot of other schools that I've heard horror stories about with friend having no empathy or support from their profs during all of this. \n\nChallenges were feeling unengaged without live lectures or seminars and no in-person office hours. The weekly work load is also larger with so many profs opting for weekly assignments as opposed to proctored exams but I think that it's better than the alternative.\n\nI feel bad for first years tbh.",

This term has honestly felt like a complete waste of my time and money. I've learned so little and legitimately fear that I may not pass a majority of my classes. Assignments have been little more than stress-inducing busy work with shoe-horned in concepts rather than the well-structured learning opportunities I've come to expect from years past. Perhaps it's just been the courses and Professor's I've had this term, but if I could get refunded the last 4 months of my life, I would.",

It's definitely harder this year because there's a significant increase in workload, but my grades haven't suffered for it.  I really need a break though, I can't wait until next Tuesday (my last exam for the semester). \n\nI do miss in class though.  I would have liked to get to know my profs better, and teams just doesn't do it for me.  I thrive on in person conversation.  So I've missed that, and it would have added to my education for sure.  But I feel lucky that I've managed as well as I have.  \n\nI also have a lot of empathy for people struggling.  Truly, this isn't how school should be and I hope everyone pats themselves on the back for coming as far as they have and accepting their limits and abilities - including those who realized this doesn't work for them and decided to put things off until next year.",

            "comment": "it all depends on the individual. msci is extremely flexible compared to other science programs, bordering the line between science and social science. But there will always be people who'd find something like biochem/math/stats/etc. easier, despite more hours and less flex, and vice versa.\n\nIf you're scoring 90s in highschool, that could be a good indicator. But at the same time, I know people who had 90s in hs getting sub 70s in uni, and others who had 60s in hs getting 90s in uni.\n\nSo tldr, all depends on you",

            "comment": "i\u2019m currently in my first year of msci and i haven\u2019t found it too hard to keep a decent gpa (i had a 91 average in high school and i\u2019m averaging in the 90s now) but i do know the class averages are somewhat low in chem and bio and people have been struggling. but if you put in the work, stay on top of things, and ask for help when you need it, you should be ok. if you have friends not in stem, be prepared to spend more time than them doing schoolwork. make sure you have a balance between school and social life, but also sometimes you just need to get shit done. most content first semester was high school review and some this semester but there\u2019s been more new content this semester. i\u2019ve heard second year is definitely the hardest, there are 6 heavy mandatory courses and many people take additional heavy courses (orgo, bio, psyc) as prereqs for professional schools so you really need good time management. some people take courses in the spring to lighten the load in second year (im taking hlsc 2p27 this spring which people say is usually harder in the normal year). i\u2019m taking astr 1p01 and 1p02 as an elective credit and it\u2019s super easy, no assignments, only 3 online multiple choice open book exams that take me like 30 mins each, and you don\u2019t need to study. i got a 100 in 1p01 last semester and 100 on the first exam this semester lol. you need to take a humanities credit and in the spring i\u2019m taking iasc 1f02 which i heard is pretty easy and you get a full credit in only 2 months (8 months in a regular year). if there is a humanities credit that really interests you though, take that. overall i think it\u2019s a good program, you get a lot of flexibility to take courses that fit your career goals and that\u2019s why i chose it. i don\u2019t know too much else though because i\u2019m only in first year and the courses are very generalized and not specific to msci. sorry this is a lot but hope it helps and feel free to ask any questions!",

            "comment": "Not in med sci, but did neuro. Many overlapping courses in the first two years. Super easy to maintain a good gpa especially in upper years. Comes down to you. Work with others, use old exams if you can find it (hint: get to know people because it\u2019s usually through them you\u2019ll get these things), go to office hours, make school your full time job. Since you\u2019re in this program I have a good idea what your end goal is, and you will need to be a diligent student. In my experience the profs are very willing to help if you are willing to put in the effort. Except Vesprini, he\u2019s a good guy but an asshole of a professor. FYI, 3.9 on the omsas scale is 85+ at brock. So if med school is your goal, as long ad you get above an 85 you are in a good place",

            "comment": "I'm finishing up 2nd year now, 1st year was quite nice compared to this year i didn't know the study methods that worked best for me in 1st year but I still ended up getting a 85% average, honestly it depends on your strengths, for me memorization courses were the hardest for me, like HLSC 1F90, it basically just textbook based, bio was better, the profs were great and the labs and reports were super easy n basically free marks, chem was the best for me but it depends on the profs, I had poly from CHEM 1P91 last year and I found it pretty bad, but i have him from CHEM 2P20 this semester and he's definetly improved his teaching methods, Sergio Paone for CHEM 1P92 was the best prof I've had. Otherwise choose elective credits you're interested in so you don't slack off on them. 2nd year is super interesting mostly because I took biostats and research methods over the summer so I had a lot of leeway with my course load as well as the classes being a easy A. Both anatomy classes are god sent. I will say musculoskeletal does a lot better of a job at teaching it, both the prof and lab dem are amazing and teach so incredibly well. HlSC 2P09 isn't the greatest class, the prof is passionate but not the best at teaching but BIOL 2P97 has a great teaching system, and profs are great, im in the online one which for some reason is a lot of work weekly but I feel like I'm actually learning. I took orgo 1 and 2 as well, not too bad of a class but we don't have the usual prof this sem, and everyone said we got lucky on that one. You just really have to stay on top of orgo  but it's also not required for medsci majors.",

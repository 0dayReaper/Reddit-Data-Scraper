My only recommendation is to focus on getting high grades in your required courses (so biology, chemistry, English and a 4U math). Then pick easy electives to boost your grade. I found intro to kin very easy and also extremely helpful for me in my first year",

I'm quite worried because I my bachelor's GPA is only 3.78; though my diploma's GPA is 95%, \n\nThere's nothing I can do right now but to wait until March next year.",

    "postText": "I am an economics professor at Brock, and teach ECON 1P91.\n\nFor those who are interested, I have a YouTube channel with interviews of academics, physicians, lawyers, and others:[www.youtube.com/channel/UCMTmP0Va0HTpDjjUrb-on-Q](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMTmP0Va0HTpDjjUrb-on-Q)\n\nThe YouTube series is called \"Economics in Quarantine,\" since we are primarily discussing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIf you know anyone, at Brock or elsewhere, who is doing cool things, and is interested in being interviewed, then get in contact with me. Thanks.",

As of right now, I am only taking stats/data management. If it is possible can someone please explain this process?",

Regardless if you found a work around for not needing to take them, I can guarantee you would find BSc program incredibly challenging during your first year. Take the courses that will help you in the future and don't cut corners as the high school courses are free, university courses are not.",

Then again the program was offered to me through a different situation than direct admission so it might not be the same.",

If you\u2019re a new student, the entry requirements are on the admissions website and math is just an option from a list, as long as you have the other prerequisites. \n\nYou may be looking at an older program calendar that requires 1 credit in MATH/COSC/APCO as part of the degree requirements? That isn\u2019t a requirement to complete the degree anymore. \n\nMake an appointment with Central Advising about program requirements and/or changing into the program and they\u2019ll help you through it.",

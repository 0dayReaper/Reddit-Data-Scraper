    "postText": "So, Im in second year and registered for Comm 2F00 and ENSU 2P01 for spring which started today, and after reading the syllabus for ENSU it seems really hard and a heavy course which I don\u2019t want. Can anybody suggest any other \u201cP\u201d course I can take instead of it for the spring that\u2019s STILL available? \n\nMy major is social sciences and im in second year for reference.\n\nThank you!!",

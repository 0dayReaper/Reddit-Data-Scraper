    "postText": "I\u2019ve been at Brock for a few years now and after discovering notjustbikes on youtube, I see some glaring issues with the campus. Despite bus passes being offered to every student, I feel like way too many people are opting to drive simply because the space is available. The parking lots are bigger than the school itself and they only serve one purpose: to store cars. I wish St. Catharines wasn\u2019t such a car dependant hellscape and I feel like Brock has an obligation to do better by the community. Also at the East Academic crosswalk, I\u2019ve seen people blow the light and almost hit students trying to cross. Huge parking lots are ugly and stressful to navigate through for everyone. I could go on but I\u2019m curious if anyone else feels the same way\u2026",

Yet they are still paying for a bus pass they can't use.\n\nI realize you've watch a doc about evil cars, but bikes in the case of Brock are only useful for a select few who live close to campus, but not on the bottom of the hill.",

They took away my ability to park, so I just parked somewhere else. \n\nWe\u2019ve got a balance on campus, you can walk around, live, and eat on campus. And the rest of us can make our education possible in part by having the access to parking.\n\nI\u2019m glad I have somewhere to store my car while in class, and it\u2019s okay that that patch of asphalt doesn\u2019t do anything useful to humanity while i\u2019m not using it. Same for the campus buildings when they\u2019re not in use. Something doesn\u2019t have to be 24/7 useful and aesthetically pleasing to justify existing. And cars are an incredible tool of mobility that save me and others and enormous amount of time, and free us from insane costs of living in dense neighborhoods.",

Here a few reasons why: \n\n1) Since cars are the main option for transportation for most people as they are seen as the most efficient form of transportation, everyone wants to drive. This causes an unnecessary amount of congestion on roads as for most people as there is no viable alternative to get around. Public transit in this country is nowhere near good enough to compete with cars, so everyone drives. The best way to reduce congestion is to get more piece off the road. \n\n2) Having thousands of cars drive on your city\u2019s roads everyday also create more wear and tear on the roads, meaning you have to waste money servicing them more often. More cars also mean more pollution too. \n\n3) Above ground parking is a waste of space that could be avoided if more cities privileged public transit, biking, and even walking as viable modes of transportation in the manner they do with cars.",

Regardless I will quickly rely to each of your points. \n\n1) Nobody knows, probably not even you, what you meant by \u201cmeaningful congestion.\u201d Nobody likes getting stuck in traffic or moving 20% of the posted speed limit due to congestion. This literally happens daily in downtown St. Catherine\u2019s during rush hour. Also occurs daily Glendale and Glenridge. I used to live on Glenridge and work downtown, so I would hop on a bus and it would take 20 minutes to reach the downtown terminal! With no traffic this route takes like 7mins. This is a painfully bad take bud.\n\n2) Upkeek in itself is not a waste and I never said that. My point was that cars weigh a lot, having thousands of pounds of force cross over roads every minute of the day creates a lot of wear and tear on the roads, causing them to need to be serviced more frequently then they should. Servicing roads costs lots of money. How to save the city money in the long run? Reduce the amount of cars that are on the roads, even by just a fraction and this will improve the lifespan of your roads. \n\n3) Parking is necessary for cars, but at the same time parking takes up a lot of space. This is space that could be used more efficiently. For example, you could have more businesses or housing in place of many parking lots. Both of which generate tax revenue for the city whereas parking does not. Not to mention we are in a housing crisis, and more housing wouldn\u2019t hurt. Obviously some amount of parking is always necessary, as cars still serve a useful purpose. \n\nAlso, limiting transportation options to one single option in any city is a bad idea, here it just happens to be cars.",

            "comment": "This is an incredibly narrow-minded take, and basted on OPs posting history, this seems to be the case generally for OP.\n\nNot just bikes fails to consider that not the entire world lives in a city. This youtube channel is based in Amsterdam, a city with excellent public transit because the geography and population density supports it.\n\nCanada is an extremely large country, with an extremely low population density. It is not reasonable or sustainable to create an expansive public transit network. Canada is highly dependent on cars due to this factor. It is also ignorant to suggest most students live on campus, Brock University finds itself in a unique situation where it is the university that predominantly serves most of the Niagara Region and a large portion of the Hamilton region. The Niagara Region does not have an expansive transit network as it shares some of the aforementioned problems that Canada has broadly.\n\nFurthermore, public transit is quite unreliable, as transit does not run late at night. Students often-times like to spend nights at friends dorms who live on-campus or spend late nights in the library studying. Often past the times in which St. Catharines transit runs. The transit does not run because the number of people using transit between these hours is much too low to be sustainable.\n\nLastly, some people like the convenience and comfort of their own car. As someone who takes public transit to and from Toronto frequently, if the city wasn't so undrivable, I would much prefer to take my vehicle. I frequently run into people strung out on drugs in transport terminals, often using them in the terminals, and it genuinely feels like an unsafe and uncomfortable experience. I would also like to leave on my own schedule, rather than waiting for a TTC train, waiting for the delay to end inside a TTC station somewhere along the line, and then waiting at the GO station for another half an hour. When I want to leave, I like to be able to leave.\n\nIf you want the big-city transport go to a big-city. St. Catharines simply does not and could not have infrastructure to sensibly support a model like this.",

                    "comment": "look i\u2019ve made 1000 different arguments in the comments about the very issues you\u2019re saying that i fail to see. why do you think public transit sucks so bad and why do you feel like your car is more efficient? probably because all of southern ontarios infrastructure was designed around cars. cars do not belong in cities because they require a huge amount of space and less dense neighbours should have alternatives to car use. it\u2019s just a horribly inefficient system. \ni probably would agree with you if i was still in high school because i had no concept of what a world without cars would look like. u can say canada is a big country and has tons of space which makes cars necessary, but the population density varies from place to place. southern ontario has a very high population density. \nyou also prove my point that most money goes into private car related infrastructure as you mention that buses don\u2019t run late at night. obviously people are going to drive if a bus isn\u2019t running like come on, think for a moment. bus and train infrastructure was defunded which has forced people to drive because trains barely ever run because there\u2019s zero funding that goes towards it. \nand you talk about how bad driving in toronto is, maybe because it was a city designed for pedestrians and then it was turned into a car infested hellhole because of conservatives in the suburbs who wanted to drive into the city. now the place is a bunch of parking lots and space that only caters to one portion of the demographic. \nnotjustbikes was also born and raised in london ontario so he has first hand experience with the infrastructure and the flaws that come with it. he literally made a video on the evolution of toronto and how cars took over [link](https://youtu.be/KkO-DttA9ew). please broaden your \u201cnarrow-minded take\u201d and think outside of car-centrism please",

No junkies, and freedom to leave at the exact moment I desire. \n\nSure it works for some large cities I.e. toronto, it does not work for 90% of the Niagara Region, making St. Catharines inaccessible by car, would block off the rest of those centre's who vastly prefer to travel by car because it is extremely practical. By and large Southern Ontario is made up of rural communities with the occasional city. We have sparse areas with high densities.\n\nAnd btw, if you're going to make this a political rant about Conservatives, at least do some fucking research. Conservatives just brought in a huge grant for transit within the greater golden horseshoe, and NRT is expanding because of this. They're also completing an Eglinton crosstown extension, building a whole new line in Toronto (the Ontario Line) building a new GO station in Hamilton, bringing all-day go to STC and NF (stations will reopen in the spring currently closed because they're also having the infrastructure upgraded) and they're also extending the subway network in Thornhill.\n\nOn the federal side Pierre Poilievre has been a huge advocate for high density housing in areas that already support transit infrastructure.\n\nSo yes I have done my research, maybe you should before screaming about politics on reddit.",

Just watch the NJB video i sent you before, it will be illuminating. also you seem to mainly rely on personal preference because you hate drug addicts and love the freedom of \u201ccars.\u201d oh hell ya i love getting stuck in traffic and having to work around rush hour but ya let\u2019s just build [one more lane](https://environmentaldefence.ca/2020/09/15/why-building-more-highways-wont-make-your-commute-any-better/). i love having to pay for gas that can just get more expensive out of nowhere. i love relying on the kind hearts of mega corporations to have my best interests in mind. i love paying for insurance, and maintenance, and new tires and all that other stuff. it\u2019s not about completely gutting car infrastructure, im saying there should be more than 1 option for people and it\u2019s clear that cars are the priority while buses/public transit are viewed as some means to get poor people around. NJB has talked about how the netherlands has the best car based infrastructure as well as it forces drivers to pay attention while here, the roads are wide and are designed to make people feel as comfortable as possible. i\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been driving and have found yourself realizing \u201coh shit, im driving on autopilot\u201d and that\u2019s all because of road design. our infrastructure is from the 1960s, im just asking for some innovation im not trying to take away your precious car. car dependency creates ugly, isolated communities that give kids [asthma](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/vehicle-pollution-causes-4-million-new-child-asthma-cases-every-year). we are in the midst of a climate crisis and it might have something to do with forcing people to use a combustion engine to do the most basic things like go to work, buy groceries, go to a friends house, go out for food, go to school, go to the gym\u2026 anything. build the infrastructure (properly, not just a bike gutter next to a fast road), and people will use it.",

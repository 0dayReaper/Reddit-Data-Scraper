But I\u2019m saying truthfully that not attending will not work in this scenario, it might if you wanted to boycott a specific prof or something, but it doesn\u2019t harm the university itself. \n\nIf people are really scared to go back, I would recommend talking to your individual profs to see if they\u2019ll let you tune in virtually. A couple of my classes this year have had people joining our in-person seminars on screens when they were sick at home. If you have a good prof they\u2019ll allow this for your peace of mind.",

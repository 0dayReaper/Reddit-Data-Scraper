If you want to take 7 or more you need to ask for permission but they are pretty strict and you really need a good case to get the permission. \n\nAlso keep I mind what 6 or more courses means workload wise. If you don\u2019t live at home anymore  and have to provide for yourself/work, having more than 6 is a serious challenge. \n\nIMO take 5 and do really well instead of taking 7 and doing mediocre",

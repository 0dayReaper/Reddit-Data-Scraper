            "comment": "I would say make a checklist with dates of absolutely everything you will have to hand in throughout the semester. Once you complete something, delete it from the list. Highlight/prioritize major assignments and exams and give yourself a week or 2 to slowly chip away at working on them rather than staying up all night trying to finish it. Dedicate 1 or 2 days a week to clean up weekly assignments or readings. As the semester starts you should gain a better understanding of which courses will require more attention. Again, prioritize more challenging courses. You can do this by spending some extra time reviewing lectures and practicing/studying concepts or even asking for help. Overall, managing course load is less stressful when you know your deadlines, DON'T cram, and prioritize. Oh.. get some sleep - your brain stops retaining info at some point no need to overload. Your brain works best with sufficient sleep!",

But the time the semester comes to a close you will already know most things. Keep an agenda to stay on top of everything. Anki is super useful for rote memory courses like psych or bio. Less useful for something like Orgo but not fully useless \n\nAs another said, it\u2019s a full time job so treat it like one. I used to come at 830 and leave at 8pm. That was my day 5 days a week. Weekends I would come at 11 or 12 until 6 or so. If I had plans I did them because I was usually on top of things.\n\nSpeak to profs and tas. Ask them how to succeed. Office hours even if you don\u2019t have work to ask about (find something). This was the single best thing I did. Also sit at the front. Ask the kids in the front to work on group assignments or if they want to study together. Awkward to do? Just a bit. But hey splitting up studying works wonders. People also know others who have old material and it works surprisingly well. University is better done as a team than on your own. \n\nGood luck!",

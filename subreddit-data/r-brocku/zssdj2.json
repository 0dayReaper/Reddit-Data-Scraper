Also Info Sys concentration, finish in July.\n\nI don\u2019t study much I just treat class time as my study time and participate a ton cause that saves stuff to my memory a lot better than just listening. I make notes during class too, more so as another way to remember, I don\u2019t really look at them much. I also hate group work as almost everyone is an unreliable, unaccountable slacker so I accept this and often do most of the work to boost my grade.",

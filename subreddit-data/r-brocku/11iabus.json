The details are here:\n\nWe are hosting a student town hall on health care privatization on Monday and I thought you might be interested in coming.\n\nWe are holding a virtual student info-session on **Monday March 6 at 6:30 PM**. It is open to all post-secondary students, and if you are faculty, you are also welcome. We have arranged excellent speakers who will be able to lay out the threat to public health care, how it will impact your future, and how it is already impacting the services that students rely on. \n\nSpeakers:\n\nNatalie Mehra: OHC Executive Director\n\nHisham Shokr: Ontario Medical Student Association\n\nAnissa Carruscal: Community Mental Health Nurse\n\nRegister here: [https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZctdO6vrj8qHtPT0-Ku3doze01AGRtl7dyh](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZctdO6vrj8qHtPT0-Ku3doze01AGRtl7dyh)\n\nPlease join us, and if you are part of any groups or can promote to your friends or students, it would be hugely appreciated. **If you are unable to attend, please still register so we can send you the recording and follow-up.**\n\nIf you are faculty and could promote it to your class or would like to help organize events on your campus, please email [ohc@sympatico.ca](mailto:ohc@sympatico.ca).",

This is all that's on offer (probably the page you looked at): [https://brocku.ca/guides-and-timetables/timetables/?session=su&amp;type=ug&amp;level=all](https://brocku.ca/guides-and-timetables/timetables/?session=su&amp;type=ug&amp;level=all)\n\nMain thing is setting it to \"Returning Students\" in the filters to make sure you see everything available. And no there's not another date that more summer courses registration open up, it is just March 1st.",

In my few years at Brock, I\u2019ve only been able to take 1 summer course and a couple spring courses to apply to my degree. Very few profs teach over the summer, and the ones that do typically teach their specialties.",

I didn't mine him as a teacher but those multiple choice questions were very difficult and screwed up a lot of people's grades.",

A lot of the theory questions were worded very different to the notes, so even if you had the notes memorized, you would struggle. He liked to make the options very similar to confuse people. So you needed to remember every detail of every rule, which is why everyone did bad besides 1 or 2 students. The calculations were similar to the ones in the notes. Like I said this could be a one year off thing because during covid he didn't do multiple choice questions.",

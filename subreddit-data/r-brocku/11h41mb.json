    "postText": "Hello everyone! I have a room available at lofts building 6 floor 4, the apartment is girls only. It would be a lease takeover as i will not be returning to lofts. The rent on the lease is $555/month, that will be the rent you\u2019d pay till renewal in august where it would go up by like $5 or so. Please message me if you\u2019re interested :)\n \nEdit:\nIt will unfortunately be a sublet only for May-July, lofts won\u2019t allow me to let someone take over my lease since my rent is so low :(\ncan also dm on insta: damilxla.o",

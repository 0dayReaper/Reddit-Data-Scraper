Did it give u good job opportunity\u2019s? Coop opportunity\u2019s? How was the work load? \n\nI want to actually go into teachers college how ever concurrent Ed was already closed and I\u2019m kind of scared what if later I wanna back out of it since it is 6 years. \n\nSo these 2 programs interested me a lot but which one gives more opportunities and over all is better?",

So far I\u2019ve only done the midterm however I found it extremely fair. \n\nYou\u2019ll need to take a STATs course. I took STAT 1P98 and I would say I spent about 3-7 hours a week doing the weekly quizzes or assignments (depending on the week). I will note that I\u2019m not the best at math. In this course, the midterm and final were fully online. \n\nThe workload for the rest of your first year classes will depend entirely on what courses you take specifically. \n\nIf you have any other questions let me know!",

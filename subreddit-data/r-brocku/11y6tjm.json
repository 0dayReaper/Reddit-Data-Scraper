    "postText": "I just applied today to applied lingustics speech and hearing and didn't go through OUAC and went through the Brock U website instead. Has any transfer students applied late? Do you think I will get an acceptance before residence deadlines? Also, as a transfer student from Laurier, does my GPA impact my acceptance? I had a 90 average in grade 12 but have a like 65 GPA cuz i hate my program and its not what it says it was. Can anyone help me out with any of the questions I listed?",

I can\u2019t say for sure if you\u2019ll get accepted or not but for what it\u2019s worth, I was able to transfer to Brock from another uni with like a 30% average cause my high school average was like 80%.",

The grades from my last semester of uni before transferring to Brock were all 0's because I didn't deregister properly and they still let me in. I wouldn't stress too much since Brock isn't usually harsh when it comes to admissions. Unless you're applying for a competitive program, they're usually pretty lenient. For your specific situation, I'm not sure what would happen if you don't get 60% but I can't imagine they would reject someone for being right under the cutoff. Just do what you can to meet the conditions and understand that this is Brock admissions not Harvard or Yale or even York admissions.",

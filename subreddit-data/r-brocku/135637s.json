    "postText": "Hello, just reaching out to anyone in here who is in the BAcc program and has done the 2nd year courses: ACTG 2P31, ACTG 3P43, ACTG 2P97, ECON 2P91, FNCE 2P91\n\nHow did you find these courses? How much were the textbooks? Which professors would you reccomend? Advice for succeeding in these courses? Will be taking them in September but need to register for them soon whenever course selection opens up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone could help, comment down below! Thanks.",

            "comment": "ACTG 2P31: easy with parunchana. She lets you adjust weightings depending on your marks with 2 possible schemes which is pretty nice. Just skim the textbook and do a couple chapter end problems for each chapter. Midterm/Exam problems were VERY similar to those end of chapter problems afair\n\nFNCE 2P91: breeze with Hoover but beware - his quizzes are deceptively easy. He gives you 30mins for problems that take like 10 but every tiny mistake is -4 marks out of like 30 or 35 (no part marks). So even if you finish in 10 dont submit then; triple check all your answers to make sure you didnt miss a decimal or input a number into ur calc wrong. As for prep just skim the textbook and do a couple practice problems from the end of each CH. His exam was also crazy easy - he gives too much time for stuff so take advantage of tht\n\nACTG 3P43: idk how this has changed but I did 3P41. 3P41 was super easy with Li, lots of weight on assignments so take your time and do good on those. Exam was just a copy of the assignment problems with diff numbers pretty much, so if you did well on them you did well on the exam. Textbook is v helpful for assignments.\n\nECON 2P91: Had razavi for this. I found it easy but a good gauge for how hard it'll be for you is how well you did in first year stats/itis 1P97. If you did well in those you'll have no trouble here; if not, maybe a bit harder. Lots of weight on assignments as well (like 40 or 50% or something).\n\nACTG 2P97: had Alex for 3P97 here so not sure what they changed about it. but for 3P97: bird course. All assignments and a final project. Only test is a midterm and it's free (word of advice: study source documents like invoices, POs, etc. because that's how the midterm is given. if the course is more or less the same and you get to the midterm, you'll know what this means.)\n\nTldr: this is a relatively light courseload, shouldn't be too difficult to get high marks.  I'd recommend all the profs above they were solid.",

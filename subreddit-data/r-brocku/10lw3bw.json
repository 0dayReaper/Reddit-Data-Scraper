    "postText": "So I\u2019m a grade 12 student interested in sports management. From what i understand it\u2019s a pretty competitive program. I\u2019m like a 83-84 average student based off some peoples marks that got in to the program will those marks even be good enough to get in? I just need some clarity.",

However something you dont get told in HS is that its pretty easy to switch majors in uni so if for whatever reason you don\u2019t get in and SPMA is what you genuinely want to do then dont worry too much because you can always try and switch programs once you\u2019re already enrolled in the school. Keep grinding tho, obviously the higher average you have, the more likely you\u2019ll get in!!",

            "comment": "I'm currently in level 2 of medplus and applied going from year 1 into year 2. \n\n1. There are 60 spots going into year 1, and then if you apply going into year 2, you can apply to take the spots of people who were dropped/kicked out of the program.\n2. The program is relatively competitive. From what I heard, there were about 300 people who applied and they can only accept 60 but those number could be wrong. I applied going from year 1 to year 2 and I think there were about 4 of us accepted. I'm not sure the number of people who applied but I do know of some people who never got accepted.\n3. The program has no shortage of volunteer or research opportunities. There is a lab in St. Catharines called norgen which has close ties with the program, being in medplus also looks great on a resume. As for volunteer opportunities they send them out basically on the weekly and there is a volunteer fair usually around October of each year. I personally started volunteering at the niagara falls public hospital this year which was made a lot easier through med plus. I also already had 6 years of volunteer experience with the lions club when I originally applied for med plus.\n\nAnyways I hope I was able to help a bit. Feel free to DM me any other questions.",

                            "comment": "Extensive work experience being 3 years at food basics lol. My ECs include ski team, swim team, 6 years with the lions club, some church volunteering, and some other small volunteer experiences in high school. My references included my manager from where I worked and my lions club supervisor who is a very prominent member of the local clubs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have to maintain an 80 average as well as get 50 volunteer hours a year to stay in the program. You can also only miss two meetings and modules combined. Med plus is basically a 6th course and I'd say is genuinely a heavier course than most of the bird courses at brock. Its not like the modules are difficult or anything, its simply the consumed time which you could use for studying or something else. MedPlus is fantastic in providing you with very good opportunities to meet with some very interesting people, as well as setting you up with a career path in health care with the trade away being you essentially have an extra class (or half class as it really isn't horrible).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy application in my opinion, really wasn't that strong. I had an 89 average out of highschool and an 84 average in my first year of university. Keep in mind I never studied in highschool and just started in university, other peoples grade changes may be much different. I think what really did it was my volunteering experience. I have a very long term volunteer position and not many people can really say they have been with one organization for that amount of time, so I imagine that worked very well in my favor.",

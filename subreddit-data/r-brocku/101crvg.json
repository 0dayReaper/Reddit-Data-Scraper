It could be during reading week or during the April exam period (which I think would be most likely)\n\nThere might also be something on the syllabus regarding deferred exams. I do think there is a deadline where you have to do it by (end of July I believe) but I dont think there are specific dates",

Typically the make up dates are pretty early into the semester, but they\u2019ll provide enough notice of the date (3-5 business days) and attempt to work with your schedule to ensure no conflicts. Guessing that you may have a make up exam, expect to hear back possibly the end of this week or sometime of next week, but I would say the absolute earliest to expect taking it is the first Friday back. Latest I would expect is the second or third week back as profs do want the info to still be somewhat fresh in your head.",

I love brock, believe me, and while they are making progress to become a research powerhouse, they aren\u2019t up there like their peers (aka uoft, McGill, etc) yet. I do believe they are on track to get there but not quite yet. These researchers are just cited a lot. What this tells me is that they publish a lot. The inference that their work is so great because their work is cited a lot is a stretch tbh. A better metric is how much of their work is used in high impact journals if you ask me.",

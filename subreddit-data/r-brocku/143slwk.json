His grading is very fair, and tests and assignments were not hard if you followed along in class. I didn't take 3P94 however. Also he's very good at listening to students in class and pulling the string of whatever ideas you throw out there, makes for fun discussions imo.\n\nCome to think of it, his classes are my highest marks at Brock, but I was also a try-hard in his classes haha.",

You may get away with a doctor's note but, that usually leads you to doing a lab another time or doubling the weight of all other labs. You have 10+ people do it and try... They're gonna laugh and say see ya in the summer. You may get to work on your computer and drop into a lab to show it's done and dip. But, CHEM 2P20 is run with a firm hand to say the least. Speaking from experience.",

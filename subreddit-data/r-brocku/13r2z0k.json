Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree program is an option for those interested in creating their own customized program of study in the sciences, which ends up being great option for most people. For some, this program could be used as a way to complete courses to meet the admission requirements to programs for which they are not initially qualified at the time of admission to the University. So in your case, if you were still wanting to be in the Kinesiology program, during your first year you would take the requirements you would need to be in that program that were left out when applying to this program and along with Kinesiology first year courses that are needed. After your first year is completed, you would then fill out a change/declare major program form letting the registrar know that you have decided to change your program major. I hope this helped!",

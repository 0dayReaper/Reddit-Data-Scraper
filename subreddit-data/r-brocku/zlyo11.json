    "postText": "I am a third year transfer student previously from UofT who just got accepted to Brock for Fall 2023 BA in Psychology program, but I might switch to the BSc. Can anyone tell me how they like the BA, or the BSc in Psychology? Does the BSc contain an overload of science? Any tips on brushing up on my psychology/science before classes start?",

Your psychology courses will offset the required science courses you have to take so you should be fine.",

But regardless there\u2019s not many job options as a Psych Major anyways. BSc is a slightly more science and math heavy version of the BA. And the psych BSc is a less math and science intense version of the neuropsychology stream in neur. So it\u2019s probably a decent middle ground. \n\nI doubt any employer would prefer you to have a BA over a BSc, they might not care or they would prefer the BSc because it looks better to them, but it depends on the job. It might matter if you are applying to grad school though depending on the exact program you are applying to. \n\nI\u2019m assuming you were doing a BA in Psych at UofT? If so you may have to take extra courses to catch up if you plan on switching to BSc by taking science and math courses you didn\u2019t take in your BA. You probably wouldn\u2019t have to do this if you stayed in BA, that would be one advantage of the BA.",

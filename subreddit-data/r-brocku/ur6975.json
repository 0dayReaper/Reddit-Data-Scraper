    "postText": "He\u2019s been repeatedly emailing the student body accusing BUSU and other parts of Brock of suppressing and oppressing him, yet he\u2019s not elaborating at all. This time he\u2019s sent the entire student body a 6 page essay, and has said that he can\u2019t share more specific details because that would \u201cruin his plans and strategies\u201d.\n\nCan anyone help me make sense of this? From my perspective this seems overly dramatic and nonsensical but if there\u2019s more to this I\u2019d love to know.",

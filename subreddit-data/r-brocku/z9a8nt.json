    "postText": "I recently got accepted to Brock with the knowledge that there is space in the program for the Winter semester. Long story short, when I tried registering for courses there was literally no space in any of them and not even a waitlist for any of the courses I need. I was told to talk to the department advisors bc they are the ones that are able to override the courses. The person I talked to told me she  wouldn't be able to do that (I have no idea why). Is there anything else I can do? Does talking to each professor help?",

It's helpful to have the professors approve the override, but they can't actually put you in the classes. \n\nIf all else fails, you can try contacting the department head, but I wouldn't count on them being able to find a space if the classes are actually full.",

Talked to the department advisors and she said she can't do anything. Should I try my luck with another advisors lmao?",

I'm thinking I'll probably email the department again and ask why she wasn't able to override after accepting my application in the first place but idk im kinda hopeless at this point.",

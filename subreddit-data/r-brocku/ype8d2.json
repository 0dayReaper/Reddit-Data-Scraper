I would not recommend dropping the courses, especially becasue depending on your program and year, it may backfire (I was a CHYS major, and you have to apply for 4th year, and if you don't have all of your courses that need to be done by the end of third year, you run into a lot more problems and headaches, and can't register for certain courses). Just be careful of stuff like that. Honestly, I think you'll be fine, just put in the work, and you'll do awesome",

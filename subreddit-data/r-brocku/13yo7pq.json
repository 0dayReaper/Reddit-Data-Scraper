I\u2019m looking for ways that I would be able to commute via bus, train during the weekends to Brampton but I\u2019m bit confused. I would appreciate if previous Brock students who know a route to Brampton from Brock via bus or train would let me know, thanks!",

My parents would pick me up from the station and it\u2019s about 30-45 mins left to drive home. If you wanna take transit the whole way I\u2019m pretty sure you can take another bus or train that goes to Brampton, bramalea, or mount pleasant from aldershot",

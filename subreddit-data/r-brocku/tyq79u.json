    "postText": "I've seen a lot of discussion on people who are currently doing poorly in certain courses, and who are wondering what the ramifications will be. As the spring term comes to an end I wanted to address a few important points:\n\n1: Failing a few classes is ok and nothing to be ashamed of: The majority of people fail/retake/drop at least one course. In fact, most people in 4-year degrees take much longer, often 6 or more years to get a degree.\n\n2: Ask your academic advisor if it will affect your placement in the program. Most courses have a specific average you have to keep. For things like co-op it is often higher than the base program, and so being unable to meet that level will probably just put you back into the base program.\n\n3: Don't give up: I know it can seem like it is impossible to get a decent mark, but if you still have a final exam then chances are you can squeak by regardless if you study hard enough. Many people overestimate how badly they are doing and how behind they are. I know it can seem tempting to consider it a lost cause and focus on other courses. However in practice, people often lose out on being able to pass, and don't make good use of the time they freed up.\n\n4: If failure is inevitable, start planning how it will affect your future schedule: Although some courses are a prerequisite for others, it is possible to get into a course at the teacher or faculty's discretion. Ideally, you'll have a mark reasonably close to the passing grade, decent marks in other courses, and an explanation for why you didn't do well. Explain your plan to get back on track and how you will prepare for the second course, as well as your plan to retake the first. This is not a guarantee but I have heard of people who got in.\n\n5: Be sure to take away something: Failing a course is tough and stressful, but as long as you learned something, your time and effort was not wasted. Think about what it was that worked and didn't work. If you were going to have problems, it is probably for the best that it happened now rather than later.\n\nBest of luck to everyone in their exams! Surgite!",

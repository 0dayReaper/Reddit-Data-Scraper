            "comment": "Side note: I majored in history. I'm not saying your friend shouldn't major in it (I loved the program and I learned a lot), but he really needs to think about what the end goal is (what kind of work, pay, career trajectory, etc.). It can be a challenging area to find work in. I completed a BA in history from Brock. Then a diploma in nursing. Followed by one year of post-graduate studies in cultural heritage conservation. I am currently finishing up a certificate in occupational health, safety and environmental system. I had no luck finding well-paying, permanent, long-term jobs in the history field. I spent 5 years as a nurse before becoming a health and safety technical writer, and then landing my current job as a training advisor in the mining industry (which I love!). My point - have your friend consider where he sees himself in 5-10 years and what he hopes to do for a living, because good jobs related to history can be challenging to come by. I know some people who have done really well - keeping in mind that it took a good decade of part-time, seasonal jobs to finally land something permanent and/or well-paying. All the best to your friend!",

From what I am aware, within the next few years, there is going to be an influx of teachers retiring. This is a good opportunity for him and I hope things go well for him in the near future.",

Same text for both courses.\n\nIf you get in, YOU NEED TO PRACTICE. You will struggle big time if you don't. They're completely in ASL but the profs are very good at communicating, so as long as you pay attention you won't have any issues. But if you don't practice, you'll definitely fall behind. \n\nThe tests work two ways: either the prof will sign things, and you'll write out the English translations. Or, you'll sign for them. In asl1, we used conversation exchanges from the text and filled in the blanks with our own info in a recorded video (I have one brother, I have two sisters, my favourite colour is green, etc). In asl2, we told a story from childhood to the prof (live). Formats can vary. \n\nHighly recommend these courses!!",

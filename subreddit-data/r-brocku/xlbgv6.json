It\u2019s fibre to the home meaning the condo unit has fibre connectivity. I would use the wifi and get nearly 100 upload 100 download parallel speeds with 9 ping on my Xbox one. Don\u2019t let the low download deter you from how consistent and dedicated it is. There wasn\u2019t fibre cables exposed in the rooms\u2026",

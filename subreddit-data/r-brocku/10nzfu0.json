Honestly, most math-related courses in Med sci require statistics, so I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be at a disadvantage not talking advanced functions. PM if you have anymore questions!",

You will be taking coursed to stats up until your fourth year. I just graduated and you\u2019ll have a course in fourth year thats heavily focused on stats and if you fail it you wont graduate\ud83e\udd72 it was a hectic course because I slackeddd in my stats courses",

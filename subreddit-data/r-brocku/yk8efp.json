Although I wish you would have all thought before you likely, indiscriminately pressed yes to giving away your voting rights: \n\n*Removal of Election process for Executive positions:\n\n-Executives will be hired through a student-led hiring process.\n\n*Brock University Students\u2019 Administrative Council (BUSAC) restructure:\n\n-Open to all students to join without the requirement of an election.\n\nhttps://www.brockbusu.ca/government/elections/\n\nJust wait until the \"student-led process\" ends up being a bunch of elected BUSU directors, and whatever little club of students they form, appointing their buddies into the position.",

Thats normal.\n\nThis one literally had no change if the \"no\" vote won, like the ONLY reason they would promote it was for the yes, or else they were campaigning for you waste your time and vote for basically nothing. \n\nFrom someone inexperienced with poltics, the whole thing looked sketch.",

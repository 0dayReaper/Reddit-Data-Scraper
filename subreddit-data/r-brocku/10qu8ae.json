    "postText": " \n\nTLDR at the bottom\n\nHi. I plan on going to graduate school but I have a 3 years bachelors in Biological sciences and I am from India. The international credential equivalency page says for India -\n\n\"3-year Bachelor's from institutions with a NAAC rating of \"A\"; 2 year Master's awarded beyond a 3-year Bachelor's from institutions with a NAAC rating below \"A\"\n\nI am currently enrolled in\u00a0Siddharth College\u00a0of\u00a0Arts, Science &amp; Commerce in the program Biological Sciences, which is rated as B+ according to NAAC. This college is affiliated to the \"University\u00a0of\u00a0mumbai\" which has a rating\u00a0of\u00a0A++.\u00a0University\u00a0of\u00a0mumbai is also my degree granting\u00a0university, so I will have my degree and transcripts from\u00a0University\u00a0of\u00a0Mumbai.\n\nSo which college's rating is considered? Am I eligible to apply? I asked the Graduate office and they said that it will evaluated after you apply, and to make sure I meet the minimum requirements, but I am confused about this.\n\nTLDR - The requirements says 3 years bachelors from NAAC A insitutitions is acceptable. The college I go to is B+ and the university to which it is affiliated is A+. Am I eligible?",

Although it may be affiliated, the current education you\u2019re getting is controlled and operated by Siddharth. It\u2019s definitely worth applying but I would definitely see if you can get more info from Brock prior to applying",

So even then you would say they would not consider the university?\n\nI did email them but they said we can only evaluate it after you apply and said \"to make sure you meet the minimum requirements\". So I am confused. Would you say I am ineligible?\r  \n\r  \nBtw, have you ever seen anyone not meeting the minimum requirements, but still get accepted based on their profile?",

They won\u2019t know about your school or care. It\u2019s on you to figure out. You\u2019ll need to ask specific questions. Until I know what you asked and how you asked it, it\u2019s hard to say how to proceed. You can alternatively ask other graduate programs with the same requirements and see what they say. Likely, though not certainly, the rules will apply to brock. As for minimums, you need it. It\u2019s a minimum for a reason barring exceptional students. You may also ask your own institution as well as the granting institution how your degree will be granted and considered. In fact I\u2019d be inclined to email your granting school first before emailing anyone else. If they say your degree is considered by/from them, you should be good. Al thought you\u2019d need to double check.",

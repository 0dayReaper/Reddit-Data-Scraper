If you are participating in the ongoing petition and want to see universities remain online for the rest of the winter term or offer the choice to learn in-class/online, please see below: [https://www.change.org/p/lynn-wells-online-option-for-winter-2022-semester-brock-university?utm\\_content=cl\\_sharecopy\\_31984987\\_en-CA%3A3&amp;recruiter=425968898&amp;recruited\\_by\\_id=13678b6a-89dc-447b-b79a-d35020466a19&amp;utm\\_source=share\\_petition&amp;utm\\_medium=copylink&amp;utm\\_campaign=psf\\_combo\\_share\\_initial](https://www.change.org/p/lynn-wells-online-option-for-winter-2022-semester-brock-university?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_31984987_en-CA%3A3&amp;recruiter=425968898&amp;recruited_by_id=13678b6a-89dc-447b-b79a-d35020466a19&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial)\n\nWe'd be looking for either a Zoom or in-person interviews.\n\nIf you're able to send me some of the\u00a0links to people I could reach out to or you'd like to participate, please contact me below.

Yes, they shouldn\u2019t be expected to get a place to stay so last min (and the prices will be atrocious), and commuting for a single class is dangerous and unnecessary. \n\nBut the reopening is causing a higher influx of outsiders coming into the Niagara region, it\u2019s very likely they could be carrying Covid and spreading it. Also, anecdotal insight, but most 20 somethings in Niagara are being reclusive and not gathering, while I have many friends in the GTA that I can see are doing anything but. \n\nI\u2019d be willing to bet that Niagara public health - right across the street from Brock - strongly discouraged this reopening for this reason (amount other reasons), but they ignored the advice of trained public health professionals.",

            "comment": "It should be very easy to switch from bio med into health sciences, especially if you want to switch into medical science. Bio med and med Sci have the exact same first year courses/requirements so you should be able to switch very easily during or after first year. \n\nThe health sciences department at Brock is pretty broad so I can't speak for all of it but I can speak for medical science. It is similar to biomedical science from what I've seen/heard but obviously much less biology and chemistry courses are required. \n\nI enjoyed my time in medical science, after the first 2 years you can really start tailoring the program to your specific needs, so I was able to take lots of psyc/child health courses because I want to work in the pediatric mental health field. There is a huge range of programs in health sci and general sciences so you can for sure find programs useful and meaningful to you.",

    "postText": "I had a meeting with my academic advisor and since I am ahead in my credits and have 2 more years for undergrad in coned she told me I should take some of the internship/ co-op courses in EDUC I guess. I was a transfer student so I had a lot of credits I could transfer. So I\u2019m just wondering if anyone took these internship courses and what are they about? Any info would help",

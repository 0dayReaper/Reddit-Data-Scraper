Surprise, surprise, they expect you to know how to spell as well as possessing proper grammar. It's too bad they didn't practice what they preach here though. (Friday, end of semester?)",

Microsoft loves to have \"smart quotes\" on by default all of their products. They use different \"quotes\" than the ones that are on your keyboard because they \"look\" better. The person who wrote this email, probably copy-pasted from something like Office into Outlook and it looked fine. Other email readers often have problems displaying these characters so they show ? instead. Turning off \"smart quotes\"is always the first thing I turn off whenever installing any Microsoft product because it always causes me so many problems.\n\nAlso, that's not SPAM, that's information that you might find useful or interesting",

I want to give you guys (the 3 wearing a hat, one with a hoodie and the other friend) a chance to return those light bulbs. Im ashamed that you guys (the 2 wearing hats) not only shoved the light bulbs in your jacket pockets, but you also took pictures and laughed about it. I don't want to take this to the authorities but if they aren't returned in a reasonable amount of time, I unfortunately will have to. You don't have to interact with us. Just return it the way you stole it or leave it on the counter.",

It's not the type of light bulbs you put in your house but they're the expensive kind that I have to buy directly from the people that put in the whole light fixture. \n\nI appreciate your concern and suggestion tho!",

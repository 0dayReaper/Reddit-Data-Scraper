Its quick shot of people uniting and having a blast, with an impressive amount of people in a relatively small space, all while promoting the Brock U name. And I think the chaotic mob works well - its actually quite funny replaying it and finding the different characters sprinkled throughout the mob - its like discovering funny little things in a Wheres Waldo. The dude on the right in the leather jacket trying to quitely take notes had me going pretty good, and the shirtless dude being doused in beer. \nAnd the randomness of the objects was hilarious... used car flag, crutches, an empty water jug, a friggin mattress. Comedy.\n\nGood work Brock. \n\n\n/an appreciative alumni. \n\n",

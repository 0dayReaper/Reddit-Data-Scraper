Unfortunately, the way the program is set up you would not be able to move ahead, regardless of transfer credits. Since the program builds off of first year, they do not allow you to transfer in with advanced standing but instead reduced course loads because of the applicable transfer credits. \n\nAs stated by someone else, best to speak to an Academic Advisor for the full answer.",

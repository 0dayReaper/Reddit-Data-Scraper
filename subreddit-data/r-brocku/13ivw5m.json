(what ones are easiest lol) \n- how\u2019s the workload? \n- what should I generally expect? \n\nAny advice is appreciated, thanks! :)",

His exams are MC but weirdly specific. The study guide is priceless. \n\nIn stats, make use of online resources provided, and office hours. Tim is one of the most supportive profs Brock has, he will help you.",

Not too bad at all. \n\nStats has a weekly assignment that's marked on completion, meaning as long as a reasonable effort was put forth (each question was attempted), you get full marks even if stuff is wrong. Then four quizzes, and four exams. I found it felt very balanced and while I worked hard in that course, I never felt overwhelmed by it. \n\nCognition has biweekly assignments that were walked through in seminars, so they were pretty straightforward. And two exams, I believe. There was also a poster project at the end of term, which is a nice change from papers. Also done in pairs. \n\nThe careers class, 2p01, has monthly assignments that aren't too bad (but they shouldn't be left to the last minute), and you'll need 40 volunteer hours as well. The volunteer hours cannot start until October so don't get ahead on it, though it would be super helpful if you figured out where you'd like to volunteer ahead of time. They offered us the option of getting some hours by doing certificates on LinkedIn, but that was COVID year, I don't know if that's still an option. I will say that my volunteer work turned into a good paying job that I absolutely love, so take it seriously - it could be a great opportunity if you volunteer somewhere you want to work.\n\nSocial psych was one paper and two exams. The prof is super nice but expects a high level of retention, so ensure you're familiar with the concepts and studies he goes over in class. He *will* ask specific questions.\n\nAbnormal psych had either weekly or biweekly assignments, I can't remember, but they were pretty easy and very straightforward. You'd watch a video, then either determine diagnosis using DSM criteria, or determine treatment. I can't remember how many quizzes, but no exams. It's an interesting class, too.\n\nLifespan development was probably the easiest course, though one of my least favourite profs. I found her manner condescending, and her assignments were mostly annoying, but they were very easy and not too time consuming. There were weekly quizzes and no exams. The largest project could be done with a partner to lighten your load. \n\nThat's all the psych classes I took second year, can't comment on others. Overall second year was my favourite year!",

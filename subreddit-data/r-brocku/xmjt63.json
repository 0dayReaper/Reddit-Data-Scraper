            "comment": "Wtf are a-levels. I know what they are because my parents are from a country that uses the British school grade tiers but 99% of people here won\u2019t know what that is. The university will likely use a combination of your grade 12 and 13. Look at Brock\u2019s website. They literally spell out what you need. Any further questions they don\u2019t answer you should get addressed via a phone call or email. Also wtf are maths. You\u2019ll need to clarify in your email what your \u201cmaths\u201d covered. Without looking they will probably want advanced functions and calculus. \n\nSo you should first look at the website. See what you have. Second, email and/or call admissions with specific questions laid out. Leave little room for ambiguity if you can (ex instead of asking if your \u201cmaths\u201d is ok, specify that your math courses covered x,y,z , and is or is not equivalent to advanced functions/calc and you want to know if it\u2019s okay). Third, while you wait, do your own research to figure out how things compare",

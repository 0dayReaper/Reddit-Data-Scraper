            "comment": "You can go to the bank, banks will loan you money if your folks will co-sign. They have loans designed specifically with tuition in mind. Highly doubt you'd get bank money though without a co-sign, unless you've built up good credit and have good-ish income.\n\nOther alternative is just working throughout school. I've worked full-time my entire time at Brock (I don't use OSAP, and I think OSAP has (or used to have) limits on how much they'll let you work before they start diminishing your loan allotment). Work+school has kept me constantly busy, but it sure is nice having cash. And when you register for classes, Brock will post what you owe them prior to the semester, however you will not get kicked out of class if you don't pay on time, you will only be bared from registering for additional future classes.\n\nSo I've used this to my advantage when I couldn't pay off tuition immediately, I'd just chip away at it each month over Fall/Winter til the balance was zero, then I'd register for Spring classes, and do the same thing. Just have to make sure your balance is zero before the registration periods.\n\nCrime also pays, I've heard. Or you can breed and sell dogs, that's quite the racket and probably should be a crime.\n\nEdit: OH ALSO, OSAP only looks at your parent's income for 4 years after high school. After that point they don't consider it, and you can get all the loan money you need. So, you could just wait if you're out of options.",

If you've been outside high school for long enough, you don't have to report your parents income as you're technically a mature/independent student. \n\nIf you don't qualify this way, and don't state your parents income, OSAP may question your ability to fund yourself through school, as they ask questions regarding the costs associated to living, travel, additional expenses and savings prior to commencement outside of simply putting your income. They in turn can ask for additional information (proving you\u2019re fully independent/estranged from them). Once it gets to this point, failure to complete the forms, or if found to be falsifying information can result in reduction in funding, cancellation of funding or reduced future funding.",

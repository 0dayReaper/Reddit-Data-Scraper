    "postText": "I have been thinking maybe CS just isn\u2019t for me and was thinking of switching to accounting at Brock. I already have about 1.5 years of the brock CA course completed, mainly the non cs courses that I need to take. The cs classes is what I am struggling with the most. \n\nWhat\u2019s the procedure to switch to accounting? Do I have to go through the whole application process as when I first got into brock or is there a different path I need to take to switch majors if I am already a student here?\n\n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "I'm in a similar process, and (from what limited knowledge I have) it's pretty simple. I was able to get in contact with an academic advisor from the program I wanted to switch to, and she was able to hook me up with a \"Major Switch Declaration Form\" something or other. You might be able to access it on your my.brocku.ca page, but I'm not quite sure. Depending on the program, it may be a limited capacity or not. I'd suggest discussing details further with the accounting department academic advisor(s).",

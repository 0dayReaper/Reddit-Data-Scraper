    "postText": "Dear brock, pls get rid of the frozen yogurt machine and get another Tim\u2019s. The lines for Tim\u2019s and starbs are atrocious. And before anyone jumps on me and says make your coffee at home, I had to get the meal plan in first year so I\u2019m tryna use it all before I graduate :( \nI also just feel bad for the workers because they have like two people trying to do everything and they go through their breaks all the time. They need help.",

I\u2019d imagine it would help wait times at Tim\u2019s, especially now that as it gets cold there will be more demand for the indoor locations.",

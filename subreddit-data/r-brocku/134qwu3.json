I'm an International student and only need requirements for 3.\n\nI was told that applications are reviewed from 1st May, and have received the International Education Fund Award already, but nothing else. I don't believe they tell you if rejected, but I believe you can follow up and ask the status.\n\nFrom what I know, you'll usually get a reply by the end of May, if not safe to assume you were rejected.",

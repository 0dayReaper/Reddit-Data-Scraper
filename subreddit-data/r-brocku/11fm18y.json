    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI have a bit of a situation that I'm hoping some of you might be able to offer some advice on. I recently discovered that I have an exam scheduled for 9 am the day after a concert that I booked during the Christmas break. I had no idea that the exam would be scheduled so close to the concert, and I'm worried that I won't have enough time to study and prepare.\n\nI'm hoping to find a way to reschedule the exam to a later date, but I'm not sure what excuses or reasons might be legitimate. Have any of you ever been in a similar situation and successfully requested a rescheduled exam? What excuses or reasons did you use, and how did you go about making the request?\n\nI know that I may have made a mistake in not checking my schedule earlier, but I'm really hoping to find a solution that will allow me to perform my best on the exam while still being able to attend the concert. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance.",

This ultimately is a life lesson in priorities OP. Sometimes you don\u2019t wanna work early in the AM but you have bills to pay - for example. Some discomforts in life are unavoidable, skipping the concert or feeling tired in the morning if you decide to go is an example of so.",

If you're having to ask for advice on which to choose or if you can reschedule an exam, which you can't spoiler, then you've pretty much summed up your choice. Making up false excuses reinstates your point of view that this class doesn't matter but 4 hours in a sweaty room with music does. I'm trying to not be mean here but how is this even a debate on what to do. And on the off chance your exam gets postponed, it could be moved to the next scheduled exam period that could potentially be the end of spring/summer term depending on the prof/registrar. Reevaluate your decision making, as the registration price for a single course during spring/summer is probably more than your tickets.\n\n\nTLDR: take the exam and skip the concert.",

Profs stress the importance of not booking any trips or special events until after you know your exam dates because that is not a legitimate excuse for missing any form of class work. It is your duty to plan your life around your classes as you are paying thousands of dollars for an education. You have (at the very least) financial incentive for prioritizing school over a concert. This might sound harsh, but my advice to you is to re-evaluate your priorities if this is a thought that even crossed your mind.",

It also doesn't help that we haven't received any feedback or any marks back on anything, and the time frame to drop a course was back in november. How am i supposed to know whether or not to drop it if i haven't received anything back.... and we don't see turn it in results for the project either...",

The assignments had their rubric hidden on brightspace but after I found that it wasn't so bad. \n\nThey do a lot of \"scaring\" particularly to weed out the students who have zero time management skills and arent interested, so jus tlike biol/chem 1p91/1p92 you just gotta get through it.\n\nThe exam is only 15%, way less than most course winter exams so no matter what happens, I would stick it out imo. \n\nAlso yes, seminars are completely unrelated to what the topic is that week, theyre just little exercises so dont commit much effort to the assignments, I do the bare minimum and just prioritize other things. But marks are marks, and the 8% or so from seminars may even make up for a poor exam performance (even though once again, youll be fine!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\njust my two cents, good luck!",

Once you get into the focused courses, I.e. a full term in one specialized area, I found it more in depth and more interesting.",

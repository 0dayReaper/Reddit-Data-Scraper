I tried one of the pizza places and it charged my general dollars :(\n\nI also have a few guest passes I could gift if anyone wants.\n\nIs there anything to do around campus these days. I have 3 days left and it's kind of dead around there. \n\nI also have a physics iOLab I spent way too much on. What do I do with it?",

I\u2019d go to Guernsey Market and grab a bunch of drinks, chips, etc. It\u2019s expensive as hell so you\u2019ll go through your money fast. \nIf this isn\u2019t your last year of school at Brock, the dining dollars do continue on to next year.",

There was no exam but there were quizzes (this may not be the case if it is in person)\n\nADED1P31 is one of those courses where you have to write a fair bit but as long as you do write you get good marks. It is a lot of self-introspection. You can actually learn some pretty interesting things about yourself, but many of the questions they ask in the weekly journals are just incredibly monotonous and repetitive. They force you to take a question that would take one sentence to answer and stretch it into a paragraph.\n\nIf you are a reasonably good typer and not shy about sharing, I would say go for it.",

    "postText": "Hello folks,\n\nI am a HS student planing to get a degree in Game design and Brock is one of the places on my list. I was scrolling through the great Internet and read and saw alot of  stuff and have got mixed results some say Game design is worth it some say it isn\u2019t. Not just that some people are calling out Brock to be one of the worst Unis in Canada and that it should be your option only if you don\u2019t get in anywhere else. This led me down the spiral of overthinking so I think its best to know from the people who are at Brock.\n1. Is Game design worth it?\n2. Is brock worth it?",

I also used their labs as IASC students also have access (I took IASC 1P10), and the labs are nice.\n\nAs for opinions on Brock, you\u2019ll get different answers from students in different programs, and different answers from within programs. And you\u2019ll get lots of opinions from people that didn\u2019t go to Brock. You get out what you put in, profs certainly are into the subject matter. My main critique of Brock is my classmates have been terrible group mates most of the time, just wild the incompetence. People do not give a shit about their education the majority of the time.",

Checkout the labs, meet the students,  professors and ask them questions. \n\n\nI personally don\u2019t care about the ratings or what other people say about a university. If the university offers the program and courses that I like, located in my preferred location, and within my budget, then it\u2019s a good university for me. That\u2019s BrockU for me.\n\n\nVisit BrockU and see how you\u2019d feel about it.",

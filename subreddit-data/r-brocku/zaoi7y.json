How many math courses do I have to take? Also I can't find anything about Co-Op os there no such thing at Brock?\n Any insight would be greatly appreciated thanks!",

I have taken the psychology courses required to take and the workload is not bad just make sure to keep on top of everything and don\u2019t slack off and you should be able to get at least a 75%+.\n\nAnd no, there is not a lot of biology but there is some Psyc courses that have biological elements and neuroscience elements but nothing compared to what a biology major would study. Brock does have Co-op but the FPAC program does not have a Co-op option at the moment but might in the future. The program does have a Practicum Course where you would work for a community organization related to the program where you do 10 hours a week for 8 weeks.\n\nHere are some useful links:\n\nhttps://brocku.ca/webcal/2022/undergrad/fpac.html\n\nhttps://brocku.ca/social-sciences/fpac/#fpac-courses",

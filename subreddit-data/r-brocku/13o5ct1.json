I have a car and B. I\u2019m only going for four months cuz I have co-op in winter term.\n\nAnyone been able to get out of this? Let me know, thanks!",

            "comment": "Nope, there is no opt-out.\n\nA bus pass on the system over 12 months (which is how long yours will be good for), is just over $1000 for St. Catharines residents (which doesn't include out-of-town service, which I think our pass does, which is another $900 for locals). So why isn't it $1000 a year for Brock students? Because Brock guarantees the transit authority that every Brock student will have to pay $300, and in all likelihood the transit authority will only have to service some fraction of the student population, and most of that service will be over an eight-month period.\n\nSo essentially we have a socialized bus pass at Brock, like we have socialized emergency services, health care, public infrastructure, defence, and so on in Ontario &amp; Canada.",

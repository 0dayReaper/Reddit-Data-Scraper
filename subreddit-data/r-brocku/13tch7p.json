    "postText": "This may sound silly, but I\u2019m pretty anxious about making friends. I\u2019ve completed a pre-health sciences certificate and my SSW diploma and have worked in the field for a few years now. In the fall, I\u2019ll be going to brock for Psychology. I\u2019m living off-campus in an apartment with my partner. I\u2019m very excited and very happy, but anxious about the social scene. \n\nAny mature students have luck making friends? I\u2019m pretty much over my \u201cparty years\u201d. I wake up at 3/4am, have a coffee and go to the gym. I\u2019ll go to class then be in bed pretty early. Any tips on making friends/approaching people as an older student without being a weirdo? \ud83d\ude05",

            "comment": "Came back last year at 28. Biggest advice is: Be a joiner. Take as many social opportunities as you can manage. Join a bunch of clubs. Some of them will fit, some of them won\u2019t. The only way to know is by trying. I.e. I tried Fencing, but it turns out I don\u2019t have a competitive bone in my body. \nI\u2019ve had a phenomenal time so far, partly because I haven\u2019t been distracted by partying. Best grades I\u2019ve ever had in my life, because now I know how how to sit down, and focus. I saved my nickels and paid a crapload of money for this shit, and I\u2019m not going to fuck it all up for a stupid reason. \nThere probably WILL be a disconnect. Both from a generational disconnect, and a lot of these whippersnappers are just out on their own for the first time in their lives. I just came to the understanding that I\u2019m an old man, and I\u2019m ok with that. Give them the space they need. \nGood luck OP! Shoot me a message if you\u2019d like to talk more.",

            "comment": "I started Brock when I was 29,  and eventually made some acquaintances when I got to upper year classes, mostly with folks I regularly did group projects with who were in their mid-twenties. I checked out some clubs my first year, but definitely felt like most that I trialed were geared toward 20 year olds and had that atmosphere, so I ditched.\n\nI've just maintained my friendships from before Brock and those have kept me happy throughout (I finish Brock in 33 days :) ), I just keep up online and travel to see my friends every month or so. Kinda worked in my favour as I ended up focusing on my school work way more than during my previous stints at university where I was way more social and folks were much closer to my age.\n\nI think I've also just treated class itself as my social time, by participating a lot and talking to classmates. Then I can leave xD. I also worked full-time my whole time at Brock so that's definitely been a hindrance in my case.",

Is there any courses that would be more beneficial towards my degree or any you recommend? I\u2019m not picky on what the course is about, I just want it to be manageable as I will be working during it. Thank you! :)",

It\u2019s heavily based on writing which I believe will be beneficial in the long run. I am taking it this fall/winter and not sure if it\u2019s going to be offered this spring until the timetable releases. If you have any specific questions you can pm me.",

Derek Foster was my prof, liked him a lot.\n\nI think the selection of 1.0 spring/summer courses is pretty small? I haven't tried to find one myself, but from what I recall it's a lot of 0.5 credit courses (that's all I've ever taken during Spring).",

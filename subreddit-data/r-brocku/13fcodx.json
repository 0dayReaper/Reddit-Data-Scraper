How is living on campus? Is the food good with the meal plan? Would you choose Brock again? If you\u2019re in Law Plus, do you like the program?\n\nIf it matters, she was offered SocSci and Law Plus. \n\nThanks to anyone who offers feedback!",

            "comment": "I just finished my first year. I had applied to 8 universities including Waterloo, Brock, McMaster, Queen's, Laurier all of which I had gotten into. In the end I went with Brock for many reasons nor do I regret my decision in any way. I'm in the BPH program. \n\nI lived in residence and experienced many challenges however all the residence staff were great and for the most part went above and beyond to get my needs met even though it did sometimes take a while to get what I needed. In terms of picking residences, if having a kitchen is not a dealbreaker than go for Res 8 or Earp. Avoid Lowenberger at all cost unless she wants to be in a double room.\n\nI found the food to be absolutely terrible but some of my friends did like it. I would say if your daughter is picky in any way she will probably not like the food from the dining hall\n\nClasses were great. All the profs I had were fantastic and most of the TAs i had were also good. \n\nWellness services (doctors, mental health professionals) I have found to also be fantastic. It's super easy to get an appointment the same day or a day or two out if needed.\n\nGiven the opportunity, I would choose Brock again.",

I\u2019m studying business in particular, finish in July this year.\n\nI never lived on campus, and to be honest I just eat at Burrito Boyz religiously xD.\n\nI think you\u2019ll hear a lot of people say this or that school is better, but in most cases it\u2019s based on second hand info. My only complaint with Brock is my classmates have been disengaged, and hardly ever participate unless forced to. I participate constantly so it doesn\u2019t really matter, but I think class would be more enjoyable if my classmates were tuned in. \n\nOften felt like it was just me and the prof with an audience. But I figure this is due to Brock\u2019s acceptance criteria allowing for B grades from high school when accepting students. If you want more engaged classrooms you probably need to go somewhere with higher acceptance grades. However, I highly doubt you\u2019ll find better profs or better education. It\u2019s undergrad, no one is hiding secret ways to teach it better at other schools, and prof salaries are similar across the province (can check the Sunshine List database for yourself).\n\nI\u2019ve also gone to UWO, and like Brock a lot more, way easier to get support from the school. Also Brock has a much better layout for Winter time.",

I'm in Business. \n\n\nI lived on campus in residence last year. The accomodations are great. The dons are great, the rooms are decent, theres many fun residence activities that the dons plan, no complaints at all. \n\nBut the dining hall food... the food was bad. I've had over cooked and undercooked pasta on the same plate. The vegan and vegetarion options are the same 3 things. Sometimes it was literally just beans. Beans. Nothing else. Just cooked beans, not even with spices added or anything.  I've had a literal hair ball in my food before. HAIR. BALL. At LEAST once a week my friends and I found hair in our food. \n\n\nIf your daughter wants to do residence, I highly highly highly recomend a residence where you can cook your own food.",

Yeah the food will suck for the first year but its really all about the program she wants, thats what matters.\n\nAnd I will say the rest of the food on campus (gurnsey market, hungry badger, etc.) I find are very good.

            "comment": "Hi! As someone who went to both schools during my undergrad, I'd say it truly depends on what matters most to her. (I was in the sciences though)\n\nMac has the better reputation. I did my first year res at Mac and it was one of the best years I've had. There is a lot more school spirit at Mac and just generally more activities/opportunities to get involved in things. I also think it's a nicer campus. However Mac isn't particularly known for soc sci so it doesn't matter as much reputation wise.\n\nBrock is a smaller school, classes are smaller and it can be easier to get to know your professors. Also better food in my opinion. It's also much safer than student housing close to Mac. My friends at Mac had absolute garbage student homes that got broken into multiple times.  You'll get better living opportunities in st catharines rather than hamilton. Although if you're willing to pay more you can get decent housing in Hamilton.\n\nAt the end of the day, undergrad school does not matter THAT much. Schools reputation do not weigh as much as people think they do. If you've toured both campuses, she should go with her gut feeling.",

            "comment": "Public transport to St. Catherines is horrible. So if she is commuting, I would not do it. I say this from personal experience, the Go bus is terrible, especially during the winter. My car broke down last year and adding over 3 hours of daily commute, 5 days a week was a horrible experience.\n\nIf money is not a problem, depending on her program choose McMaster. I got accepted to both. However, Brock gave me a grant. These are very difficult to keep up with, depending on her program, but tuition at McMaster is significantly more expensive.\n\nBrock is supposedly a \"party school\" but I found this not to be the case, also St. Catherine's is very boring outside of the student bubble. I guess if your parents never let you go out to the store before the age of 16, and your curfew is 7 pm, then maybe that is the case? But I wouldn't make my choice of university based on that. Anyone who lived abroad, or traveled, will know that the school is not \"it.\" \n\nYou can get to know your professors depending on the type of people said professors are. I found this to be cool. This is probably not something you can do at McMaster, given that is a much bigger school, with more prestige. That being said, at McMaster, you can meet more influential people, given their status. \n\nIf she wants to go into the medical / healthcare field, just go to McMaster as a first option. In that specific field, the school you go to matters.",

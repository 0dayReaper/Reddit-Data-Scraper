Many professors did not have office hours, and some actually asked students never to email them. Now, in my current degree, professors make a continuous effort to remember everyone's name. They want students to stop in and talk to them - even if it's not specifically course related. The professors care about their students and make sure to provide them with support and help as needed.",

The hot tub is too small. Make it bigger!\n\n3. MSA feels so cliquey which is something I'm only saying because I'm insecure. As a Muslim, most of the people there already have a friend group so if you go to MSA to make friends, find someone to break your fast with occasionally during Ramadan you will not find them. Everyone there already has their friends and they just wanna chill with them during events. Which is, in reality, perfectly fine, but can feel disheartening if you're homesick and lonely! \n\n4. The merch ranges from mid to ugly as fuck (I'm talking about the new merch on the display window with the rounded letters)\n\n5. Campus is prettier than people give it credit for. The pond is so picturesque.\n\n6. I look pretty whitewashed in my student ID. I guess my hot take is just that there needs to be more ink for the ID printing machines.",

The fact that there are so many parking spots to begin with encourages many people to drive, some of which could use transit to get to school instead (e.g., live in a close enough radius to the school to take a 15 min bus ride). Instead of taking a relatively short bus ride, many people still opt to pay for a $700 parking pass (which is insane). If you take a walk around the Glenridge area and even Winterberry area in Thorold you will see lots of cars and many of them have parking passes. The problem is that having a gigantic parking lot makes people think that parking is a the best and most convenient option for them. \u201cWhy would I take the bus when I could just drive, it\u2019s quicker anyways.\u201d If more people bussed the city would be forced to run more busses more frequently to keep up with the increase in demand, but they do not bc the parking infrastructure supports their decision to drive. \n\n2) only a small portion of students commute by car, the majority live on campus or nearby. Obv parking is necessary for commuter students. \nAnd transit is not \u201cfree.\u201d Every student is charged a $300 fee for a transit pass. You can view this in your \u201cStudent Financial History.\u201d \n\n3) The cost of parking is indicated by the damned for it. This is supply and demand lol. So the parking costs $700 not bc brock is trying to dissuade people from parking, they want people to pay for parking passes as they are a business and want your money. The problem is that building more parking will simply \u201cinduce demand\u201d for more parking by tricking people into thinking it is a viable option. But the more parking you build, more people will begin to see parking as a good option to getting to school, and you once again are left with another overflowed parking lot. This is bc many people already have cars but don\u2019t pay for parking due to the price or constant overflow, so you would probably swoop up this demographic at least. \n\n4) The main point is that Brock can implement changes that would serve to reduce its parking lot size and get people bussing, but they don\u2019t. They make too much off of parking passes and parking tickets to be motivated to reduce the size of its parking lot.",

The first quote groups those who commute from afar with those who commute by car locally into one large 30% statistic. There is no indication from this stat about whether \"most students who can take the bus DO actually take the bus,\" as you say. \n\nAnd this is true for the second quote too.  This second quote merely suggests that 12,000 originally come from the GTA and now reside in the Niagara region to go to school. Hence the wording \"from the GTA ***living*** ***in*** St. Catherines and Thorold.\" They are living here, not commuting from the GTA. \n\nAnd 18,000 \\* .70 = 12,600. The number that they provide of 70% of students commuting by bus to school only really accounts for people from the GTA lol, plus a tiny bit extra. \n\nAnd this doesn't even include the 2,400 international students at Brock. And this is old data from 2014 so it is likely more now. [https://www.niagaraknowledgeexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/11/2011-11-04-Stats-re-impact-of-International-Students-in-Niagara-and-Canada-from-Brock-U-Sept-2014.pdf](https://www.niagaraknowledgeexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/11/2011-11-04-Stats-re-impact-of-International-Students-in-Niagara-and-Canada-from-Brock-U-Sept-2014.pdf)\n\nAnd this also doesn't include people who come from other parts of Ontario or Canada to study at Brock, of which I cannot find information on. \n\nNow 2400 + 12,600 = 15,000, which is 83% of Brock's total population. And again, we are still missing students from other parts of the country, so this number is likely even higher, who knows by how much though? \n\nSo why then is the public transit ridership only 70%? I argue this means that a considerable minority uses parking when they likely don't need to (barring the small amount that have disability related reasons).",

Even if only 1000 (which would be about 20% of the 5400) of those students drive when they should bus that\u2019s still 1000 people taking up parking spaces when they don\u2019t need to. \n\nObviously if the number is absurdly small like 150 it\u2019s not going to be enough to make a fuss about.\n\nThis debate also centres around what distance people consider worth it to walk to a bus stop, as well as buss frequency and reliability. If any of these are deemed to be an issue to someone with a car, they will just drive instead of bussing. I agree that there are areas in the Niagara region where any one of these three factors are an issues for bussing. \n\nMy argument (which I suppose will not be resolved here) is that one way to target this issue of overcrowded parking is to make it slightly less appealing to drive to school. And I think that targeting parking spaces would be a way to do this. It may be that parking restrictions would do this job, as you say. Regardless the goal is to dissuade people from dissuade people from using cars when they don\u2019t have to and get them bussing.",

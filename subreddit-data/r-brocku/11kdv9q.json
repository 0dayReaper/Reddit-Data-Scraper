This didn't affect my funding because Brock charges a flat fee for four credits. So dropping one class each term wouldn't change funding. But if you're currently taking four classes, then yes, it could affect you. Regardless, if you drop a class, you must [report it. ](https://brocku.ca/safa/student-loans/osap/osap-forms-and-appeals/)\n\nFor spring courses - yes you only pay tuition, no other fees.",

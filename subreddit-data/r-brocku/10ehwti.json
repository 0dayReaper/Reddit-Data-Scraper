    "postText": "Hello, I am searching for an elective to replace my ENTR  course (not a fan of prof or the online aspect) I am still in need of a  regular elective or a humanities context credit. I have looked at almost all humanities context credits and none of them are offered this term that doesn't conflict with my current classes. I am interested in theory, business communications, consulting, marketing and entrepreneurship. Does anybody have suggestions? Was also wondering if what a regular elective can be. Is there a list I can see them all? or just the course calendar for 2022-2023?",

            "comment": "If it's not a context credit, then it can almost anything (except like, those weird credits that say \"will replace grade for so-and-so course code\" which are rare). You have a max of 8.0 first-year credits that can count toward your degree, so if you haven't maxed that out already then first-year courses are open to you.\n\nI liked COSC 1P02, tricky but good to learn beginner coding. ERSC 1P94 was enjoyable an insanely easy. IASC 1P10 was enjoyable (taste-test a bunch of Adobe programs, basically). What ENTR class are you ditching? I'm in 3P93 and 3P96 right now, liking them so far and they're in-person. May be full though.",

The course is offered online only, with 50% of my grade being composed of group work in which only 2 of my 6 group members have answered my emails (too stressful to have that much group work in an online class) thinking it will be best to put it off till next year in hopes that they offer it in person.",

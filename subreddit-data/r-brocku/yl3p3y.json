Might even be worth wandering down to city hall and qsking the front desk if there is someone to talk about some volunteer positions.\nMight wanna look into the Brock Model UN as well, lots of PoliSci folks in their who'll have good ideas",

It is a very good and easy way of getting involved and some relevant experience for your resume. If your preferred political party has an elected MP or MPP in your riding this makes it even easier as they\u2019re always looking to expand their teams.\n\nLikewise if you are in co-op when you eventually get access to the job board there will be relevant opportunities.\n\nBeware however, as working or volunteering with a political party will/may prevent you from partaking in certain opportunities such as being a poll worker.",

However, it\u2019s small in a good way, since you can walk to whole campus without even going outside, everything is easier to get to. AND, you don\u2019t have to take a bus do a whole different section of the school like other universities. So I think it\u2019s good how the school is built, but Brock could definitely use some renovations in the tower and Mackenzie Chown. That probably won\u2019t happen until the government allows universities to raise tuition (pre sure they\u2019re still locked down cuz of covid regulations)",

The canal.\n\nI was thinking how I used to ride my bike down the hill to the Penn centre.\n\nCrazy! I got moving pretty fast. Busses and cars coming down behind me!\n\nI actually got married by the residence chaplain. I met him 30 years later when we visited St. Catharines. Love that city!",

            "comment": "It's not necessary to take the courses based on the terms listed but if it says either D2 or D3, it will most likely only be offered in one of those terms so you won't have a choice. You can check the academic timetable on the Brock website. It's often structured this way since some of the courses you take in the winter will require a prerequisite course which you will be taking in the fall. As long as you fullfill the prerequisites in the right order, it should be fine. This means if there are no prerequisite requirements, you could take a winter course in the fall.",

As you get into upper years, you can be more flexible and even take upper year courses in the current year to reduce the course load. A  lot of students end up doing that to balance the workload throughout the year. The schdule is really only a guideline. The only thing that matters is making sure you are meeting the prerequsites.",

When it comes to the type of learning, what is the difference between LL and LEC? I know what they mean, but I am just curious which is \u201cbetter\u201d",

You just do some sample questions/analysis using Excel or some program which   is suppose to supplement the lectures but I never enjoyed them. There are usually tests you have to complete in-class and it can be hard to follow along depending on your TA. They are also really boring so I dreaded going to labs.",

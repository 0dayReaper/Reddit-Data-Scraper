I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a \u201cgay or two\u201d",

I think it could be a more robust culture on campus for sure but I\u2019ve felt safe being out to my profs and peers on campus (that saying I am yt and can be cis passing). The city itself has a long way to go but is making good steps towards more inclusivity.",

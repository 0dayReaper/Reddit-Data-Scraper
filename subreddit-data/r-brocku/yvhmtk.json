He throws in little comments in lecture that end up on his final exams and that can make writing his papers easier, and he is very finnicky. I've had him for 2 classes, and I had to attend all of his classes becasue he was so confusing. On the other side of the coin, he also spent 90% of my 4th year class ranting instead of teaching, so it was really hard to go, but I definitely would have failed if I hadn't gone to his lectures. He is a pretty easy marker if he can tell that you are making an effort in his class though, and if you reach out to him and introduce yourself, he is usually more understanding if something happens during a test or something like that. Hope this helps!",

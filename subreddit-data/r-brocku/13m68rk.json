    "postText": "My thoughts on Brock's available ITIS (\"Information Technology &amp; Information Systems\") courses and the BBA Information Systems concentration; happy to answer any questions as well. Mostly applicable to Goodman students, however I believe anyone with the pre-reqs listed below can apply to most of these courses after specified registration dates. I've taken every available ITIS course except 3P92. I'll post a link to a repository of each syllabus for the below courses and timetables/descriptions as well in a comment (if links are in the post itself Reddit spam filter takes down the whole post).\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Hit and miss, but nonetheless a robust education on offer. About 30/70 for application vs. theory content. Would take again. Got A's in all but one class. Fav classes: 4P21, 3P91.\n\n*Overall thoughts &amp; recommendations at the bottom.*\n\n**ITIS 1P97 - Data Analysis and Business Modeling** \\- Stats heavy course, do yourself a favour and take STAT 1P98 first, will make this much easier. You'll learn how to use Excel and Excel's data analysis toolkit, as well as some very random MS Access lessons. I took this class in Fall 2021 with Prof. Shuai Yuan, scored 87. Yuan is one of my favourite profs, really engages with students that show an interest in retaining the lessons. Took this online, don't know if it's typically in a lab or a lecture room.\n\n**ITIS 2P51 - Introduction to Information Systems -** Didn't take this, as far as I understand it is just ITIS 2P91 for non-business students. Same or similar content. See ITIS 2P91 below!\n\n**ITIS 2P91 - Management of Information Systems and Technology** \\- Lecture course. Powerpoints, it's all powerpoints. Very introductory course about the basics of information technology and information systems. If you have a casual understanding of what a database is you'll crush this class. Essentially a memorization course. I stopped attending three weeks in and just read the slides at home and showed up for tests and the final. Took in Winter 2022 with Prof. Princely Ifinedo, scored 74. Could have done much better but simply phoned it in. **Side note**: my exam scantron said I got 11/56, I contested it and was corrected to like 40/56 or something, was wild. **Also**, you need a 70 in this class to qualify for the ITIS concentration of BBA. Pre-reqs: ITIS 1P97.\n\n**ITIS 3P91 - Quantitative Methods for Information Systems** \\- Lecture Lab course (classroom is a lab, mixture of lecture content and using the computers for in-class work &amp; walkthroughs). If you've take STAT 1P98, ITIS 1P97, ECON 2P91, and/or ITIS 4P21, this course will be a repeat of all the stats &amp; analysis stuff you've learned already, but with the benefit of applying it to IBM's SPSS statistical analysis software. It's basically SPSS all class. Had this class with Ifinedo Winter 2023, got an 81. Will be nice to have SPSS on my resume. Ifinedo is a nice and helpful Prof., doesn't always provide full answers but you just have to ask follow-up questions. He appreciates engagement, and punctuality. Pre-reqs: ITIS 2P91 or ACTG 3P97; plus MATH 1P97 and STAT 1P98. (There is no use of calculus in ITIS 3P91, silly requirement)\n\n**ITIS 3P92 - Information Assurance -** Didn't take this class, but it's about cybersecurity, and I'm told it's theory and not application. Pre-reqs: ITIS 2P91 or ACTG 3P97.\n\n**ITIS 3P98 - Fundamentals of Database Design &amp; Management** \\- Lecture Lab course. Name sums it up, you'll learn about databases, SQL and MS Access. Builds on database design elements from 2P91. If you listen and follow along, it's very easy. However, classmates did struggle, I assume because few paid attention or participated. Professor handed out marks like candy at the end of the semester (ie: all quiz marks take on the best quiz mark, made exam optional, etc.), then asked us to do the course evaluation. Had this with Prof. Chatterjee. Nice prof, but will take 30 minutes worth of information and stretch it out to two hours by repeating things ad nauseam (but does make it hard to not grasp the info, I give him that). I had a 96 in this class leading into the group project, finished with 85 :o). Pre-reqs: ITIS 2P91 or ACTG 3P97.\n\n**ITIS 4P21 - Introduction to Business Analytics** \\- Lecture Lab course. My favourite ITIS course, essentially learn about creating different types of computer models using historical data, in order to predict outcomes for new data (for example, we used car insurance quote requests that included knowing if the person bought insurance or not, and created a model to predict if a new person getting an insurance quote is likely to buy or not, and the profile of likely buyers). SAS Data Miner focused class (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks). Not an easy class, but the content sucked me in. Plus I took it with Shuai Yuan, one of my favourite profs. Taken in Fall 2022, scored 88. Pre-reqs: ITIS 2P91 or ACTG 3P97.\n\n**ITIS 4P22 - e-Business Applications** \\- Lecture Lab course. Dear lord, this class. Taken with Prof. Vachon. Very, very nice prof, always willing to meet and talk, however I have to be honest the course was the biggest mess of my time at Brock. Also it used Top Hat in the most haphazard way possible, and the semester-long project with a local business was also poorly tied into ITIS 4P25 (which I also had with Vachon the same semester). Supposedly this course is about front-end applications (think of the user-facing aspects of websites, apps, etc.), however it is a blur of 2.5 hour long tangents unrelated to the course that distract from the material. Final marks took like six weeks to post, finished with an 89. Taken Fall 2022. Unfortunately this course is required under the Information Systems Concentration. Pre-reqs: ITIS 2P91 or ACTG 3P97.\n\n**ITIS 4P25 - Systems Analysis &amp; Design** \\- Lecture Lab course. Very similar experience to ITIS 4P22, however this course essentially is about back-end applications, and organizing a team to build an application for a client. This course and 4P22 felt like you essentially had to teach yourself the material. Finished with an 86. Taken Fall 2022. Unfortunately this course is required under the Information Systems Concentration. Classmates struggled with this class and 4P22, as in one of these classes the Prof literally ran the midterm a second time as most of the class failed what was an easy midterm if you studied for an hour or two (multiple choice and definitions). Pre-reqs: ITIS 2P91 or ACTG 3P97.\n\n**ITIS 4P26 - Supply Chain Management** \\- Lecture course. This course is a cross-listed course, as OPER 4P26, and it is essentially OPER 2P91 Part II. Does not have the feel of most other ITIS courses, however does include some use of excel now and then (professor provided pre-made Excel files we could use with Excel's Solver), but wasn't a focus of the course. It's really about supply chain theory, and a tiny bit of math to go with it. Took this course with Prof. Vaezi, I enjoyed the class, got a 90. Two sheets of double-side cheat sheets are permitted during the exam. Pre-reqs: ITIS 2P91 or ACTG 3P97; ECON 2P91 and OPER 2P91.\n\n**Overall Thoughts -** I feel the mixture of options provided a robust understanding of information systems, however it's clear most of my learning about information systems will come from workplace experience in the future, as most of these courses do little practical application (3P91 and 4P21 did do a lot of application). I'm happy I took this concentration as there's lots of opportunity in the job market for systems analysts and related careers, and the courses were not hard (although they were taxing on my patience in 2P91, 3P98, 4P22, and 4P25). Participation from classmates was disappointingly low.\n\n**Recommendations -** Most of these classes were also 3 hours once a week, making it difficult to remember what was taught the week prior, so I recommend skimming last week's notes for a minute before each class. Main advice is to avoid Vachon's courses if possible (4P22 &amp; 4P25 are mandatory for BBA ITIS Concentration, but I think other profs may teach them too), and choose your groupmates wisely and take the lead on delegation of work, lest you do all the work. Once I understood who the few responsible classmates were, group work stopped being painful and I could focus on learning from the material.\n\nP.S. **ITIS 4P23** \\- **Advanced Business Analytics** didn't exist this academic year, but Prof. Yuan told me it'll be starting Fall 2023. Its pre-req is ITIS 4P21, and there's some info about the new course online (link in comment). Wish I could take this course, but I finish Brock this July.\n\nAsk me anything",

But expect to work hard to learn the applications of the theory you learned in school when you enter the work force. I\u2019d also still go with ITIS if I had to pick again.",

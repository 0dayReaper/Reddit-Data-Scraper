Your high school courses  matter a lot less if at all. Then, you start part time and if your average is good enough you can go full time. \n\nBe warned though, if you hope to transfer credits from college, universities won\u2019t give you much.",

            "comment": "I graduated high school in 2006, so take this with a grain of salt. \n\nI also did plan, but that was because I had no fucking clue what I wanted to do with my life. I took a one year program from college to get into university. Brock looked at my application, and offered me a spot in a similar program. I accepted it. First year at Brock looks really similar for most students. I ended up dropping out after a semester. But in 2017 I went back and I learned that you can always change your major later, it just might take you longer to complete your courses. Some programs students have first choice for specific classes and any remaining spots are filled quickly by higher year students. However, if possible for you, spring and summer classes are a great option. I started in tourism and environment and ended with a degree in child health.\n\nEdited to add:\nOh, to answer your original questions. Yes colleges have their own transcript, but they will look at all of your transcripts before offering a spot.",

Thats where im a bit lost, can I go into language/education with barbering? Im not exactly sure if 1 year excellerated programs even offer side courses/electives for transfers",

I passed with a 60s average and completed mostly college level classes. \n\nMoral of the story is, you will likely get into a less competitive program however you can change to a more competitive major later on.",

However, I did not meet the application minimums from high school, but they considered me after college.\n\nAt the very least, IF YOU HAVE TO you can do some barbering on the side while you take some extra college courses to boost your application to Brock.",

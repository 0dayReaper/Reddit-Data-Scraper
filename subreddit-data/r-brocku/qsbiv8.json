    "postText": "There are only 3 online tests, they are all multiple choice (and many common-sense questions), you can take the test whenever you want within the week it's posted, there are no assignments, and the teacher is incredibly forgiving.\n\nApparently, a ton of students somehow forgot about the test, so the teacher rearranged the marking scheme so that if you miss the test the other two count for 90% of your mark anyways.\n\nIt's a great course overall and I'm learning a lot, and it definitely isn't hard. If you have the option, I'd suggest saving one of your 1pXX credits for 3rd or 4th year and taking this then, letting you have way more time for other assignments.",

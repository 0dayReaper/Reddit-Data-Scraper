    "postText": "Hi guys! I have a question since this is the end of the semester now. \n\nSo i just got the overall marks for Biology which is around 61. But the [co-op undergrad calendar](https://brocku.ca/webcal/2022/undergrad/puhl.html) here said min 65-70 something which I really don\u2019t understand. Can someone explain help if I have failed the course and have to redo, or I can continue second year like my TA said? Thank you so much",

A 51 passes a course, and as long as it doesn't drag you Major courses average below 75, you're fine. (Unless this course is non-major, then that's 65 average across all non-major courses)\n\n  \nSometimes if a course is a prerequisite for another later course, the later course may say like \"must have THIS prereq with a min of ##%\", so be mindful of that too. Also I guess work on your commitment to school work, but I don't know your circumstances.",

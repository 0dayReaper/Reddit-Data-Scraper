So, just wanted to make this post to say congrats to those who are passing (not as easy as you may think sometimes). Also, failing classes happens and it is important that you aren\u2019t too hard on yourself but also take the time to reflect on why you weren\u2019t successful so that it won\u2019t happen again. Good luck on exams!",

I asked registrar and they said probably just typically you get the grade with the \u201cmet\u201d. idk if anyone else has gone through this or not, but pls tell me if i passed",

If your grade is above 50, you passed the class. \n\nIf you are referring to the \u201cMet\u201d in the prerequisite column, that just means that you\u2019ve done the courses required to take that course. It could also mean you have the required amount of credits that is needed to take that course.\n\nTypically, most/all of your courses that you are registered for will have \u201cMet\u201d in the prerequisite column.  Hope this helps \u2764\ufe0f",

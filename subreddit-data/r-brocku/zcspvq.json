However the final was really hard compared to the quizzes. I'm guessing if the course is no longer online than maybe the grading structure has changed?\n\nTo prepare, I'd espcially look at the Wiley Plus assignments (if you had them) and textbook questions.",

If there is none, id try and put down the most important formulas and rules that you need to know. \n\nOr what you could do is put everything you can on it, and then slowly take stuff off it as you get closer to the exam if you feel comfortable",

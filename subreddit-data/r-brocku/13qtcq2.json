You would go to the table titles register to register your courses. in order to know what courses you need to take, check out your program calendar (it will tell you what you need and can take). You will then look at the times and slots available and make a schedule yourself (this is different from other schools as i know Mcmaster has the option to creat a schedule for you with the classes you need). With brock, you need to physically do this yourself. You can print out a template time table online for brock. Then ok registration day, you can register your courses",

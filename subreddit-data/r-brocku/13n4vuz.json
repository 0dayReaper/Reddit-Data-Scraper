    "postText": "A grade in one of my classes was inputted into my portal as 5% lower than what I actually got. I contacted the prof and she said it would be changed in a few days, but this was two weeks ago. I emailed her again last Monday to follow up about why it hasn\u2019t changed yet but no response. The grades no longer say \u201cunofficial\u201d so I\u2019m getting kinda worried. I was wondering if anyone else has been in this situation and if so what to do? Should I call the registrar\u2019s office about this?",

I recently transferred into my program. \n\nHowever, I want to change due to me not being able to join the GSB clubs, or not being allowed to go to the networking events. \n\nPlease advise me on whether or not I should change me major. I am considering it.",

            "comment": "Which is BS right since we also have the pay the same increased tuition as them while taking many of the same classes. I've just accepted the fact and got a hoodie that says \"technically in the shitty school of GSB\", I wear it around every few days. That being said, in Business econ we get Mr Kwong's scarey 2 logic/proof classes (2p30, 3Q91) which cause ptsd in some students. If you really want the clubs go for it and enjoy management/Itis classes but I wouldn't bother, just get an MBA after.",

    "postText": "I'm a female who enjoys being around people. I don't like isolation as I grew up in a loud busy house. I have a 90 plus average so I study a lot but I also like to have a lot of fun. The thought of being alone isolated in my room terrifies me. When I am not studying I like to be social. I love walking and jogging in all seasons and being outside so walking to get food doesn't bother me. I will be on a meal plan.\n\nWhere should I live that is social and fun?\n\nI am thinking Decew, double or single, I am open to both, or Village townhouse. \n\nWhich would you rec for me????\n\nIf you are a fun upbeat person and you are looking for a res roommate for first year feel free to message me. \n\nTIA\ud83d\udc90",

Village is definitely the more social of the two but requires that you are extroverted to create those connections. If you're more introverted, then you can definitely isolate yourself but there's still a lot of noise that goes on. DeCew I would say is the better option for a closer knit connection especially with the people on your floor because you see them all the time. From what I've heard from other Dons, the DeCew team always grows a really close connection so if you're looking to be very social, DeCew is more definite but Village has a larger outreach if that makes sense",

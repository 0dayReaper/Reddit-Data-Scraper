Try to understand why it is you're not doing better (didn't study enough for midterms? more time needed on assignments? not paying attention in class?). Lower marks previously have spurred me to be way more organized with my time and my to-do lists, doing things early, staying off my phone in class (I'm stuck there, might as well make it my study time), and turning down social gatherings when I don't have the time.\n\nBiggest factor early on for me though was if I hung around slackers, I was more likely to be a slacker too. Slackers are rarely lasting friends, best to leave them behind and pair up with folks chasing good grades.",

It\u2019s fairly normal, and it should also be a sign that pushing yourself more going into exam season is probably needed. \n\nThink about it like this\u2026 10% might be pretty common, but the people who don\u2019t learn from that will keep repeating that and that could add up over the years to like 30 or40% drop. Better to address it now and start building better habits.",

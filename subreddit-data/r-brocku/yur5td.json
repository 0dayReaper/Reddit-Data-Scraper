It saves time if you know you want to go into education or administration-based nursing I suppose. \n\nThey also have a very odd MA/MSc combo where the MA portion of your combo includes nursing whereas the MSc is a group of other health-related specialties. The program info is located here https://brocku.ca/applied-health-sciences/programs/graduate-programs/#master-arts-science\n\nBest of luck trying to find more info out! Definitely the most unique program structures I've seen while looking into grad school.",

    "postText": "I did contact the faculty of education to see if they can direct me to a student advisor, but with exams around this time, I don't expect an answer very soon. If anyone knows high-level what to expect, it'd be appreciated.\n\nI graduated in 2013 with a linguistics degree minoring in applied computing (APCO), and applied to teach overseas but it never materialized because I started a business. I returned to Brock in 2017 and worked on a new degree in computer science, finishing it in 2022.\n\nI'm humoring the idea of becoming accredited to teach highschool in Ontario but as far as I can tell, I need an education degree. I don't mind returning to Brock for a short period but I don't know the process, how fast I could complete it, and so on.\n\nThere must be some process for people in my position: I doubt I would need to return for a whole new 3/4 year program. I wonder if there's an accelerated option, or some course to bring me up to speed. I imagine a con.ed program is like 30% EDUC, 70% your teachables, right? I have more than enough transfer credits to fulfill a teachable requirement, or at least I assume so, I just need the EDUC component.\n\nAny advice?",

I am a Brock Con.ed, I finished my undergraduate at UBC, and came to Ontario after years spent outside of the country. It takes two years to become certified if you have a four year degree already. It can't be rushed, everyone does their 6 years to become an Ontario teacher, some way. You'll graduated with a Bachelor's of Education, but do not have to take electives outside of the education department. There is demand for people with STEM backgrounds both from universities and among schools. Ontario Tech University preferences all those with STEM backgrounds in their Education program, particularly. \n\nYou generally need an above average GPA. However, what is not negotiable is the amount of experience you have with children. If you do not have significant experience with children, and strong references from those experiences, you will not get admission, pretty much anywhere. If that's the case, start volunteering in areas related to your interest and age level, now, and stick to it for at least a year. \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/CanadianTeachers/comments/11picnp/prospective_student_teachers_teachers_collegebed/",

I would hate to uproot everything again (I already uprooted to go to Brock having lived in Toronto my whole life previously).\n\nBesides being a parent, I have precisely zero experience with children. I'm aiming for highschool, does that still apply? I thought there might be some EDUC courses that deal with that but I'm naive to what EDUC courses actually contain beyond a cursory understanding. I do have good marks but not sure if it's above average (average was 80, but average between 3rd and 4th year courses was 90).",

A STEM degree will give you preferential treatment, however, you also may get some points for being diverse in the sense you're a male (I am assuming; men are under represented in education), and you're a mature student. It also helps your undergrad is from Brock, afaik. \n\nYour GPA should be fine. But, you still need to have volunteer/work experience with youth. Brock is one of the schools that is especially non-negotiable about that. When I applied I had to write a very detailed profile about my work with children, across three different experiences, in my target age group (primary), backed with references from those experiences. It is the same for high school students. Read the thread I posted, it is rather helpful.\n\nGood thing is, if you get rejected you can always try again next year though. I mean at least you're employable now, and can always just do IT stuff until you get into Brocks education program as you build up relevant work/volunteer experience. Heck, go volunteer to teach some kids how to code, they would love that on a profile. \n\nAlso, I am sure it goes without saying, but you need a squeaky clean, not even a pardon, or arrest but not charged/dismissed/dropped, record with the police to teach.",

It does not hurt to get the ball rolling right now and see about volunteer opportunities in the classroom.\n\nIn 2011? 2012? I spoke to one of the FOE advisors about doing volunteer work (as I knew it was a pre-requisite to get into teacher's college) and was given very high-level advice and informally told to just start volunteering. However, speaking to my old highschool, they required it be through a more official channel, and the FOE advisor said they would not work with me on receipts or placement, not being an education student. I think I may have spoken to her under the context of concurrent education, not consecutive education, though. In your experience did you find it difficult keeping provenance of your work with children leading up to your entry into the program?\n\nAlso, yes: I'm male and over 30. I did not think these would be advantageous; in fact, I thought this might be a deterrent to entry into the program. I'm glad to know that isn't the case.",

Now that I remember it, I think I only needed two references, but three experiences I could speak too, and both my references were from the school I was already working at overseas. But I don't know if the fact I had thousands of hours of experience over others had any influence on my overall outcome. \n\nThe references were not difficult to fill out, it was more like a survey sent by e-mail with some questions about why the person is suited to be a teacher. I think my boss did it in like 30 minutes max.\n\nYou just really need to sell yourself in the profile, because they do take a 'holistic' approach in accepting students in the end. Read up on what makes a good profile etc., leaning hard into things like your understanding of diversity etc.",

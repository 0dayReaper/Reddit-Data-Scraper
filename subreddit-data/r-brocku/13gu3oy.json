In first year you have to take an extra course which isn\u2019t very valuable and adds a bit to your workload. Part of the course involves making a resume (with almost exclusively bad advice from those teaching it). Once you\u2019re getting ready to start your job search you have to submit your resume to a website which uses a program to grade your resume. You must get a certain grade to be allowed to access your job board. The problem is the website and the course want two different things so you have to totally redo your resume just to make the program happy. \n\nDuring placements you have to do a check in and these reflections which don\u2019t serve any real purpose.",

            "comment": "CS major here - I love Brock, but I understand that's a contested opinion. Personally, I'm not in the co-op stream, but I am in the research stream and the faculty are stellar in that regard. They're waiting for students to come ask them to do research, it's that tight knit of a department. I feel you don't need to worry about prestige all that often cause the work you're doing is a very good primer for later on in your career.\n\nBrock certainly doesn't have the best connection, and the department could definitely do with a fresh coat of paint at times, but the faculty are genuine and the support systems offered here are unmatched in my opinion. Plus, Brock offered me the largest entrance scholarship out of any school I applied to ($16k) which really shows their commitment to easing the financial burden (my first semester is paid off every year).\n\nLike I said, prestige is an issue that arises a lot around here. However, the research I'm doing is important to my field, so prestige doesn't exactly matter especially when, in research submissions, conferences are blind judging your paper entry. However, for things like co-op, I can definitely understand the hesitation. Like I said, I love the profs here, and I'd certainly recommend it in a heartbeat.",

Consider finding a research supervisor for COSC 4F90 or 3P99 - for me, it was one of my past professors (Dr. Emami) but you can find anyone's interests relatively easily on their page. Then it's a matter of reaching out, setting meetings, etc. Wouldn't recommend cold calling every prof, that's not good for either of you. I picked my topic by-and-large because of my supervisor.\n\nIf you don't have the space to do either of those courses for credit, you may want to consider independent research or maybe making an arrangement with a supervisor to have an unofficial working relationship with research. It may be a bit harder to fund and you'll have to do it alongside your full course load.",

I\u2019m transferring out, but not entirely because of the school. Whether you stay on campus or not plays a huge part in it. I don\u2019t totally regret my decision though they have a lot of great resources, and honestly other than the discrete math courses I enjoyed all the ones I took.",

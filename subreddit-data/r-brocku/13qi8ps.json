Yes the marking was somewhat specific, but it was still an easy midterm - if the marking wasn't specific it wouldn't even be a test bc half the stuff is just common sense.\n\nThis was by far the easiest 2nd-year accounting course and he curved the midterm average up to a low 70. You don't even need to practice textbook q's. If you just memorize concepts you'll get a 90+. For reference, after the curve, he said there were like 3 or 4 people who scored over 100 on the midterm.",

Completeness is completely different (occurrence is whether the x transaction actually occurred, completeness is whether every single transaction that did occur has been recorded).",

So I wasn't sure whether I'll screw it up in the exam \n\nLike there was this example that said sent letters to company's lawyers to confirm the number of outstanding legal claims. I thought the answer would have been occurence but turns out it was completeness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLowkey think i'm screwed for tomorrows exam lol",

I.e., I see x transaction in the books, I vouch it to purchase orders, invoices, etc.\n\nIn this case they're requesting the # of outstanding legal claims to presumably cross reference to what they have in the books to make sure every single claim is recorded. They aren't confirming the claims themselves but the # of claims",

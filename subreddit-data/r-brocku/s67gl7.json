I really hope this semester remains online or at least extended till reading week. I think it is so unfair to suddenly expect students to just come back in person when everyone is dealing with different circumstances whether that means you\u2019re an intentional student or living with someone that has underlying health problems.",

Mohawk is online for the whole semester. Brock and most other schools are keeping their cards close to the chest and likely waiting for guidance from the province.\n\nI think its likely we remain online until reading week but personally I hope the semester is entirely online or at least we have the option to do so. Students need to have choice and certainty.",

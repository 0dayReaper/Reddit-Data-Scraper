    "postText": "Im taking this class online and we've had two midterms. There are a couple questions on the second i believe i got right or at the very least deserve half a mark.\n\nFor example one of the questions i didnt use the correct format(didnt round off to 4 decimal places).\n\nThe professor responded at first and said to come see him during office hours and we had booked a specific time. I went but he wasnt there and i havent heard from him since.\n\nThere was another time previously that i sat to do an assignment that was due that day at around 6pm when i realised it was actually due at 4.30pm that day instead of midnight.\n\nI tried emailing him but its like he didnt read the email. He just said 'the due date is on the course outline. I cant accomodate your request.' But the time isnt on the course outline. I know i shouldve double checked the time but there almost always due at midnight.\n\nIs there anything i can do or anyone i can talk to? Thanks in advance!",

Some are great, others don\u2019t care and it\u2019s up to you to know when to submit. It was an honest mistake and you tried telling them, unfortunately that\u2019s the best you can do.\n\nIn terms of them missing a meeting, that\u2019s pretty rough. I\u2019d ask to meet via teams next time as they probably just forgot.",

They definitely should make the time it's due very clear, and I kind of feel it's silly to have a \"time\" (really should always be 11:59pm), but it's still on you to not assume.",

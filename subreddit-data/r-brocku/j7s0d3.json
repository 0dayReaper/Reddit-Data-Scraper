Based on my experiences with Brock, their mental health support isn't actually particularly good nor have I ever actually been impressed with their other student support systems",

I\u2019ve never felt so unsupported and lost in the bureaucracy in my life. Thank god my profs were understanding, but every other aspect of Brock\u2019s \u201csupport\u201d system was terrible.",

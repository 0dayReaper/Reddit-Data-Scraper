The assignments where not very tedious as it was all interpretive so long it stuck with the course material. Only complaint/criticism is the text book they made us buy as it really wasn\u2019t relevant and poorly explained the concepts.",

I\u2019ve enjoyed every PHIL course I\u2019ve taken so far. Favourite professors would have to be Drs. Athena Colman and Christine Daigle. Favourite PHIL TA would have to be Axel Gerhard. I have ADHD and read really slowly so keeping up with the readings is where I struggle the most since it\u2019s a reading heavy program, but Brock has some great student supports in place through student accessibility services and mental health nurses, and most professors are very accommodating with deadlines. Feel free to DM if you have more questions about the program!",

            "comment": "As a combined major in Psyc/Phil in fourth year, the Phil department here is small. I often have to make sacrifices on which courses I want to take as a result. Aside from the popular courses such Ethics, bioethics, logic, (and maybe a few others) the courses offered switch every year so you don\u2019t always get to take the courses that you may want. \n\nMy favourite philosophy professor so far has been Dr. Miles, but this will depend on what content and style of teaching you prefer. He post slides, is nice, and marks based on only three things: an Essay, in class test, and take home exam. Pretty straight forward.\n\nMid-tier: Lightbody and Berman \n\nLeast favourite: Singh and Dalvi\n\nI have not taken any courses offered by other full-time professors. Though Dr. Slothouber was aslo pretty good but he is not a full-time prof as far as I understand.",

Many first year classes cover a lot of material from grade 12, especially at first. A lot of Brock courses will have seminars (small groups of 10-20 people) that focus mainly on discussion of lecture content and reading in addition to the lectures. From my experience, many Phil courses don\u2019t have seminar presentations, as Philosophy is mainly essay heavy. But many classes at Brock have attendance/participation as mandatory (especially seminars, not so much for lectures. \n\nBut tbh you don\u2019t need any background to get into Philosophy. Pretty much all courses are offered to anyone (not just Phil majors), meaning 90% of courses don\u2019t require prerequisites (though they can be helpful). The only prerequisites many courses require is that you have taken a first year Phil course. \n\nAll of this is to say, it\u2019s not that hard. Especially at Brock. But if you want to do Philosophy as a major  I would highly consider you ponder for a moment what jobs you\u2019re considering post-grad. Philosophy as you may know is not the best for job prospects (with some exceptions). You don\u2019t need to take Phil in school to study it, you can read books and watch videos at your own time and learn it anyways if you so choose.",

It\u2019s not too heavy and very manageable, the weekly seminars are very engaging and help you gain perspective on what was taught in the lecture. It touches on very heavy but important topics, like bio hacking, abortion, and other classical ethics. The professor is extremely kind and understanding too! And he explains things very well with room for questions and class engagement.",

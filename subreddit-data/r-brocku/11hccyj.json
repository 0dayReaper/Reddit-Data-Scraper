            "comment": "I just wrapped up my minor for geography last semester, I personally found that taking online classes boosted my averages but the first year courses are a lot of memorizing terms for tests. Some advice I would give for ERSC is that when picking the online versus in person classes, be aware that the online classes (1P92 and 94 I believe) are not considered pre requisites for classes that require the in person classes. If you want to per-sue ERSC you need to take the in person classes. Overall I think my Geography classes were kind of whatever, the labs were neat sometimes, but overall they weren\u2019t my favourites nor my least favourites.",

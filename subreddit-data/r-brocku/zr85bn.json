    "postText": "Hello there,\n\nRecently I received an offer from Brock U for the BAcc program with Co-op! I have spoken with many business teachers at my school and they mentioned that this program is comparable to York commerce for accounting except it does not have a co-op program (not Schulich). I was just wondering if anyone could provide a program overview as I am really interested in the program and there is a great chance this may be my final decision. Some info: high 80's low 90's student, really enjoy accounting and have taken co-op in grade 11 at a tax firm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Is it difficult to obtain a 3.5 GPA in the program? What would be the most challenging courses that you've taken?\n2. How is the school-life balance in the Uni or program? \n3. What are the GPA requirements for the co-op terms, and are these terms usually in the spring or summer months? Are people hired by the big 4 and does Niagara have good job opportunities for students?\n4. Why do this program and university get so much hate? \"If you can throw a rock you can go to brock\" Ive heard that their accounting program is great but what are some flaws in the program structure or just in general?\n\nThank you very much for your time!",

            "comment": "4th year BAcc co-op student here.\n\nI was in a similar situation in high school. High 80s average, and I took a co-op in my victory lap year in the finance department at a hospital. I think I was able to land a co-op job as easily as I did due to having that experience on my resume.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how the GPA conversion works as Brock's averages are on a percentage basis. To stay in the co-op program, you'll need a 70 average in the major courses (which are business classes) and a 60 average in everything else (electives, context credits, etc). If you fail to maintain those averages, you'll lose the co-op option but will stay in the accounting program. Brock also offers a highly competitive Master of Accountancy program which is designed to accelerate the process to write the Common Final Exam (CFE), which one must pass to receive their CPA designation. This requires a minimum average of 75 in the major courses, but applicants should aim for an average in the 80s. The master's program is not a mandatory step to write the CFE; other routes are available but they take longer.\n\nI've been able to maintain an average in the mid-high 80s, which has required a lot of time and energy into my studies. As an accounting student, you will definitely work a lot harder than your friends in other programs. A good school-life balance is possible, but it is difficult, to say the least. This is especially true in the spring terms, which are condensed and consist of difficult major courses for the most part. Try to shift your difficult major courses from the spring into the fall semesters. I am currently taking two accounting courses this fall that I would have otherwise needed to take in the spring, which would have been hell. Now I have a few easy electives to take in the spring instead. As for the toughest courses, I would say ACTG 4P34 (Accounting for External Reporting 4, aka Consolidation), ACTG 3P33 (Accounting for External Reporting 3), ACTG 3P23 (Cost Accounting 2), ACTG 4P41 (Taxation 2), and FNCE 3P93 (Corporate Finance 2). These are all scheduled to be taken in the spring terms, so I'd advise you to move them to the fall terms if at all possible. It's worth mentioning that the professor you take can absolutely make a difference in the difficulty of the course. \n\nMost of your co-op terms will occur in the winter terms (Jan-April) as this is the busiest time of the year for accounting firms and the demand for employees is high. I have friends who work at the Big 4 firms, and I know there are smaller-mid sized accounting firms in the Niagara region that hire co-op students. It is possible to obtain an early co-op position in the spring/summer after your first year, otherwise you would have this time off (but I would recommend applying for an early co-op or taking courses early to lighten your workload going forward, you'll want your spring semesters to be lighter as mentioned previously). \n\nOverall, Goodman is a prestigious business school and the accounting program is a true test of endurance. You need to have the discipline to make it through the program. While some programs at Brock are probably easy to make it through, accounting is pretty tough.\n\nGood luck.",

I was really surprised that you said co-op is from Jan to April, as mentioned in another post was the transition to back to school difficult as you have built connections to the workplace? What did you gain out of your co-op the most? Thanks again I really appreciate it \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",

            "comment": "1. Brock has no GPA system they give %'s and letters, but getting all A's is pretty easy. Idk about courses though, none I've taken so far have been particularly hard. Apparently Tax 2 is supposed to be hard but I had a pretty good prof so maybe that influenced my exp\n2. Very good - tbh none of the courses really require too much work (only in 3rd year rn so maybe this changes?). Also pretty great that profs tend to just teach from a textbook, so lectures are mostly optional.\n3. GPA means zilch for getting actg co-ops - trust me, I found this out the hard way. As long as you have like an 80 flat average which'd be the cutoff for B4's afaik, it doesn't matter. Co-ops are usually in winter - you can find the BAcc schedule in the handbook on their website I think. Plenty get Big 4, it's pretty attainable if you network, idk about Niagara job opps though.\n4. Idk it's a good program tbh. I mean maybe it's not the best if you're looking for something like Big 4 in Toronto (still very doable ofc, but it's outperformed by waterloo afm, western bmos, uoft rotman, etc.), but still solid",

            "comment": "I am also in 4th year accoounting co-op. I dont think there's a ton more I can add to what the other commenter said but I'll try...\n\n1.) With effort, a 3.5 GPA is definitely attainable. In 1st year, most of the courses youll take arent that tough, so if you crush first year, you have a pretty solid foundation for the rest of the degree. Most of the harder courses are in upper years and I'd agree with the other commenter on which courses are the hardest\n\n2.) Despite all that, the school-life balance is pretty good. Ive been able to manage a social life, relationship, part time work, etc... while still staying on top of things academic wise.\n\n3.) As the other poster said, 3/4 co-op terms are in the winter because it is the \"busy season\" but one would be in the fall term. Plus there is the option to do one right after 1st year. Niagara itself does have a decent selection of small-mid size firms and I do know quite a few people hired by the big 4 in Niagara and elsewhere (Hamilton, Toronto, etc...) the fact that you already have experience in a firm puts you ahead of most other people.\n\n4.) Some programs have a better rep than others at Brock but accounting and business have a pretty good rep, especially with it being accredited by CPA. If there are flaws in the program structure, sometimes it is not easy to go from a co-op term back to school on a few days turnaround, especially after the busy tax season. \n\nGood luck!",

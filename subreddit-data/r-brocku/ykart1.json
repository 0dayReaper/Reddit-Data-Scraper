    "postText": "I have been struggling with a back injury for the past 4 months that has been derailing my entire semester. I was wondering if anyone here has experience with physical therapy so that I can manage that pain and recover. I don't know where to start or who would be a good professional, and I would appreciate it if another student or staff member has had similar injuries and if they could recommend someone or provide me with some advice. I would really appreciate any help.",

Within 2 weeks she had made substantial progress where before any improvement was marginal.\n\nHe is located in the extreme north end of St. Catharines and I don't know what his current rates are.",

Whatever your physiotherapy plan says to do at home, do it. I've seen a number of people skimp on the homework and not get better and then blame the physiotherapist.",

I will 100% do the therapy as it will be costly for me as a student. But without it, I can't work or complete my degree in my last year, which I can't let happen. I put too much in the line for it.",

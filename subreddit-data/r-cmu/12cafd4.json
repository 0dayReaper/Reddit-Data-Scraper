    "postText": "I graduated from Mechanical Engineering in 2020, and after the chaos of the last few years I have finally received some admits, and here are some of my top choices:\n\n1. University of Washington - MS Bioengineering\n2. Virginia Tech - MS Computer Engineering\n3. Carnegie Mellon University - MS Computational Biomedical Engineering\n\nThough not fully confirmed yet, I also likely have an admit to [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) (Abu Dhabi) for MS Computer Vision. Unlike the US degrees where I have to bear fully responsibility for the degree expenses, this MBZUAI is fully funded. I really would love to head to CMU but at this point I'm just weighing the costs/benefits especially given that I'm an international student from \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3.\n\nI know that this decision mostly on personal preference - but I'm looking for a few detailed opinions to inform my decision. In my MS I plan to work on robotics and AI as applied to healthcare and consumer applications. I'll probably be looking to join industry after my MS, so that involves the debate on US vs UAE industry opportunities of course.\n\n*TLDR - As an international student, debating whether to take up a MS Computational BME at CMU (along with 100k USD in debt) or go with a fully funded, albeit less prestigious MS Computer Vision at MBZUAI? Shower forth thy wisdom, generous folk of Reddit!*",

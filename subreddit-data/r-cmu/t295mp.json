The \"shelling of Russian speakers\" that you refer to is an inaccurate portrayal of this conflict: Russian soldiers were invading Ukrainian territory since 2014, and Ukrainian soldiers have been defending their country.\n\nAs per your claims of \"neo-Nazi\" imagery in Ukrainian protests, would you be so kind to share your sources for these claims? I am happy to address any sort of misunderstanding there might be about this issue.\n\nIf you would like to receive more accurate information about the conflict (both OP and anyone else reading this), please reach out to me and I'll be happy to answer any question you might have. However, please refrain from posting information that is inaccurate and misrepresents the truth of the matter.",

    "postText": "Hey, I am an international student who is attending CMU starting from next fall semester.\n\nSince I don't really have sufficient information towards how housing system works in CMU, or Pittsburgh in a broader sense, I just wanted to ask which in-campus housing options are available for students in CMU and how decent those options are. I specifically wanna know about Forbes &amp; Beeler, Morewood, or Fifth Neville apartements, which I feel the most decent ones, but if there are other suggestions I will be much appreciated.\n\nAlso, I was searching through off-campus housing options, but I can't find something really decent with a reasonable price. I am aiming for a studio or two-bedroom apartment (I have one friend who can share), but decent options are all expensive (my budget is around 1.2k per month). Can someone share experiences on getting off-campus housings?",

    "postText": "Hi friends:\n\nI've had a crush on a guy since last September, but I've never had the courage to tell him how I feel. Since I will graduate this May,  I suddenly realized that I don't want to regret never taking a chance to confess my feelings to him. so...I have a rushed plan to invite him to the Lunar Gala, but when I checked for tickets, they were already sold out. (may be too late, but)I was hoping that maybe someone might have two extra tickets they could sell me. I'm willing to pay an additional ten dollars per ticket. If you or anyone you know has any extra tickets or might be selling them, please let me know. Thanks so much!",

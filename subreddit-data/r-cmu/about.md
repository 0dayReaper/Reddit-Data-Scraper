Description:

A community for [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu) students and alumni.

(If you're looking for Central Michigan University, try /r/centralmich).

Rules:

No advertising, selling, or recruiting.: Any posts selling items, spamming app invites, trying to recruit CMU talent, running surveys, etc. will be removed and the poster banned. Post to e.g. /r/pittsburgh (use their stickied post), /r/PittsburghList, /r/PittsburghJobs, or any other relevant sub instead.

Don't be an asshole.: Differing opinions and debate are fine. Trolling, derogatory remarks, and *-isms are not.

Use the megathread.: For generic CMU questions, please use [the megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/744bx3/megathread_2_post_your_questions_about_cmu/). It improves our SNR, and having the answers in one place is more helpful for everyone. Yours might already be answered!

For questions not specific to CMU (like cost of living, places to visit near campus, and where to buy groceries), /r/pittsburgh is a much better resource.

    "postText": "Hello, I am thrilled to have been accepted into CMU's MS in ECE program, as I have a strong passion for robotics, particularly in the area of robotic control. However, upon reviewing the ECE faculty, I was unable to find any professors who conduct research in this area. I understand that this type of research is likely conducted within CMU's Robotics Institute (RI). I am interested in knowing if it is possible for an ECE MS student like myself to collaborate with a professor in RI on research related to robotic control. Additionally, I would appreciate any guidance on how to best communicate with the professors about their research topics.",

            "comment": "Yup. You can. The department encourages you to find professors who have courtesy appointments in your department, there should be some professors who have appointments in both RI and ECE. Otherwise, you can still choose to work under a professor from a different department, in my case, I was told that they will appoint a professor from my department who can supervise my research progress for the sake of grading and everything. But yea, it\u2019s quite flexible. Tons of people from CIT work in RI labs",

The professor that I am interested to do research with is a courtesy professor in ECE, is this the courtesy appointment that you are talking about? Thanks again!",

They\u2019ll also send an email regarding the MS research process. Once you get access to your Andrew email ID, you can start emailing the professors you\u2019re interested in working with. \n\nYes, if it\u2019s mentioned that they have a courtesy appointment in ECE, it means they\u2019re listed under ECE\u2019s faculty as well.",

    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture. After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.\n\nThis quirky tale comes from the architecture school\u2019s tech department. Long ago, the Soarch head realized that a single 3d printer and a single laser cutter for the entire architecture department were surefire ways to backlog many a student\u2019s project in need of those services. Add in the occasional [devastating fire](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/n7f54v/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_2_fall_asleep_in/) or a clique of [students monopolizing the resources for nefarious purposes](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/qd4m1o/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_25_the_studio/) and people were sure to complain. He consequently gave the green light to the tech guru to look into additional affordable machines to handle the increase in digital design and production.\n\nThe boss selected a new filament based 3d printer to try rapid printing techniques. At the time, he had an undergrad underling who took care of the daily printers. When asked for suggestions on what to print large amounts of, the student replied \u201cfrogs.\u201d The boss was surprised at this choice of animals until he heard the explanation. The underling had a kid brother also studying in a nearby university. His sibling\u2019s unfortunate nickname was \u201cFroggy.\u201d Seeing where this was going, the tech guru happily produced a dozen or so of the 3d frog model he found online.\n\nThe next morning, they were all there, alongside other things made to test the 3d printer, such as a castle, spinning top, and figurines. The neon orange frogs themselves ranged from extremely course to near perfect smoothness, for they were the primary test subject of the filament size and refinement settings, No longer needing them for evaluation, the boss gave all the frogs to the student, who spent the next evening hiding them in his brother\u2019s room.\n\nNaturally, the sibling was displeased and for the next two weeks hunted for them. Thoroughly peeved, he did not believe any claims that he missed one. His older brother kept score at work in the architecture\u2019s tech office for how long it would take for his brother to find out. The boss and other staff chuckled at the news.\n\nSix months went by before the sibling found the last frog, apparently blending in with the bright orange Chinese kite on his wall. Of course, just as the little brother found the last one, the tech boss was more than happy to produce more frogs for his favorite underling to do it again.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d",

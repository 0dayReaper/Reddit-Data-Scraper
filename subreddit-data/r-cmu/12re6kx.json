It\u2019s a challenge bc tools are entirely new to me (I mostly do modelOps, super comfortable w sklearn, gridseachcv, xgboost, etc). In this class we\u2019ve learn tools like airflow, dagshub, etc + business aspects.he stresses though that it\u2019s not an MLOps class, but value creation end to end from ideation to delivery",

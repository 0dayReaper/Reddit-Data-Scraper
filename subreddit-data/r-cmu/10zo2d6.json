            "comment": "I was barricading and did yell at a worker this morning, so there's a strong chance this was me! Here's some explanation:\n\nIn my 4 years of doing buggy, I've seen 3 buggy drivers almost hit by cars (I'm sure I don't need to explain that this would seriously injure or kill them). In all of these case, this was due to car drivers ignoring barricaders and other members of buggy shouting to get their attention because they chose to ignore the line of barricades and people with reflective vests.\n\nPedestrians, bikers, and drivers don't understand the serious risk that they put drivers in when they enter the course. When there are unknown people on the course, we have to immediately stop all buggies for both the safety of the drivers and the people entering the course (if a buggy hits a jogger, the jogger loses- we yell for their safety too!). \n\nWe have permits from the city and with that comes an obligation to have certain safety regulations in place. If we allow people to enter the course at will, it puts at risk our ability to continue to obtain permits. The city expects us to enforce the road closure.\n\nBuggy supervision works with Phipps staff and has an ongoing relationship with them- plus, buggy has been happening for years, 7-9am, every Saturday &amp; Sunday, for decades. There should be no confusion about the situation, and if there is, it is Phipps management failing to communicate with their employees.",

The number of drivers who got aggressive with me, in a way that risked hurting or killing buggy drivers was exhausting, and I lost all patience for it. Sweepstakes has been permitted to close those roads for decades, at painfully early hours to minimize the inconvenience. Drivers can choose to go around, but don\u2019t want to do that or wait for an all clear. Before you judge, try sitting out there at 5am in freezing weather trying to keep your teammates safe and having some jagoff screaming at you.",

The rudeness is unfortunate, but that's actually a private road [0].\n\nThis \"cars and Buggy\" situation has come up before among the students; I think Buggy people are particularly prickly because it's too easy to get run over by cars when you're doing whatever they're doing. (Nowadays, I'm increasingly biased in their favor -- drivers in Pittsburgh are becoming collectively insane. Had a car accelerate and horn to get me off a pedestrian crossing last weekend. Doesn't excuse the rudeness, but I believe that closing the road forever is within their rights if CMU gives the OK)\n\n[0] https://pittsburghpa.gov/innovation-performance/interactive-maps",

            "comment": "Former Sweepstakes (buggy) chair here!\nTo clarify some things:\nSweepstakes applies for and pays for the permits to close the roads from 5-9am, Saturdays and Sundays. These permits are granted to Sweepstakes by the city of Pittsburgh. Sweepstakes also pays four city officers to help close the roads, as required by the city. So to the commenters suggesting reporting buggy practices to the city: the city is already aware, has granted authorization, and has sent officers to help keep the roads closed.\n\nAs far as Phipps goes, Sweepstakes works with Phipps to make sure their employees are able to get into their lot. Phipps employees are allowed onto the road when it is clear of buggies (often a 2-3 minute wait to get the all clear). If a Phipps employee ignores barricader directions and tries to pull onto the course while buggies are rolling, this is a safety issue.\n\nI agree that yelling at uncooperative drivers is a bad look for CMU. But a student being injured at buggy practice due to a car getting onto closed roads is a much much worse look.\nTreat it as any other event. You wouldn\u2019t plow through the barricades to get onto the roads while they\u2019re closed for a marathon, and if you would\u2014you deserve to be yelled at, if that\u2019s what the onsite safety personnel need to do to get your attention.",

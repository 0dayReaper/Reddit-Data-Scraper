    "postText": "I am not doing well. I have been having anxiety attacks for the past 2 days due to some trouble with friends. I have an imminent exam today. I don't know if I can get through it and feel like I'm about to throw up. I studied and think I know what I need but I just can't focus at all and am afraid I won't be able to get through it without a panic attack/breakdown or health issue like puking. Is there any support if I just can't make it through the exam period or do I just fail\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: tyvm for the supportive comments/dms, appreciate it a lot. the exam went better than expected fortunately and am doing a bit better.",

She can help get accommodations for short-term medical issues.\n\n  \nAlso, for finals/exams next semester so you can plan ahead in case this happens again, disability resources can help with longer term accommodation, so if you have a diagnosis they may be able to help with finals in the future.",

The Phipps is beautiful and right behind campus. The Art and Natural science museum is at Craig and Forbes\u2014go visit Dippy and report back what scarf he\u2019s wearing. \nThe weather sucks, but if you have a preferred way of exercising, getting your heart rate up from activity that isn\u2019t panic, try\u201430 minutes, or even five minute breaks scattered through the day. \n\nYou were able to study despite that stress\u2014I\u2019m impressed! Get in touch with CAPS, there\u2019s summer support. And for now, make short term game plan to get through.  \n\nFriendships, even when there\u2019s a rough patch, shouldn\u2019t make you feel this way. Take a pause. The break coming up will be plenty of time to figure things out.",

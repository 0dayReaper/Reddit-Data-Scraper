Also, you can get the CSAPP:3e textbook and it's literally the exact same content with practically the same assignments.\n\nThere are some old videos on YouTube, but aside from that you might not be able to get the same experience. Although, I think slides and textbook really is plenty enough. There's also the same content from the same book at other schools if you look on YouTube",

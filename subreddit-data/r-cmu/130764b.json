    "postText": "Sorry about asking this again, but how good are the recent graduate degrees at INI? \n\nI got into MSAIE-IS, and the coursework seems rather weird. The AI courses are intro level (with one interesting Trustworthy AI course), and the IS courses are independent of AI. - Browser security, networking, etc. \n\nMy end goal is to work in an ML team, either it be MLOps, or fine-tuning models, or working on the data aspect of things. I don't really like information security (based on my feelings from undergrad), and I'm not sure if this course is suited well for me. \n\nWould really like some advice on this, and if i could talk to some people about this and get their feedback! It would really help me make a decision and put my mind to ease :/ \n\nThank you",

            "comment": "Personally I have looked at the AIE-ECE course and it has the courses of ECE with AI specialization only. But the thing with AIE is that the core courses are compulsory across all branches. This makes sense in ECE because the courses other than the core are also AI only and are connected. But for AIE with other branches I think after the core there is no actual continuation or courses where you go in depth of the field( not sure though I'm presuming this). If you want to go in depth of AI those core courses are not enough( have spoken to some students there). If you are able to get a good continuation of these courses with your branch then it definitely makes sense otherwise if you think AIE is enough to learn AI, I would say that may not be the case.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m currently expecting that I get a R grade in one of my classes right now. I didn\u2019t try at all in the class and barely finished any of the assignments because I was so terribly depressed this semester I couldn\u2019t get work done. I some how managed to get all the work done for all the other classes I took this sem but its only this particular course that I couldn\u2019t get myself to finish. I\u2019ve come to accept that there\u2019s probably nothing I can do about this and will just have take the blow to my qpa but I can\u2019t help but feel like an utter failure and a mess. I should\u2019ve dropped the course when I had the chance.  \nDoes anybody else have experience with getting a grade lower than a D? What does it entail if I get an academic probation? I feel like absolute shit and I don\u2019t really know what to do. I\u2019ve already talked to my advisor and the professor but there\u2019s really nothing I can do but accept that I fucked up.",

Get some outside help with the blues (not CAPS), don't bottle it all in like some did, and aim for a better next semester. If you end up taking the same class with the same professor, talk to him and explain you're retaking it seriously and that last semester was lackluster for personal reasons.",

You just have to be cognizant that you're gonna have to make up for it.\n\nMost important of all, I would try to get help with that depression if you haven't. It may have been one R this semester, but it can be the cause of many more if left unchecked. Speaking from experience here.",

He eventually completed his BS and ultimately ended up with an MBA, a JD, a master's in CS, and a PhD from Cal. He was number one in his class in the MBA and JD programs and is now a professor at a highly ranked university.  Consider the R an extreme outlier and focus on your health first.",

I know that is a hard mentality to adopt in an environment like CMU, but you are not alone. I was on academic probation this semester because of how crappy my GPA was last year, but I took the time over the summer to work on myself. It will not be the end of the world and you are not the only one. Utilize the time you have away from school. See if you can talk to someone about your depression. Rest over the break and try your best in the spring. I wish you luck\u2764\ufe0f",

They managed to improve their grades and are now still on track to graduate on time. You\u2019re not alone and it\u2019s completely possible to turn this around!

Finished with 2 Rs due to a depressive episode that escalated over the course of a year.  Also was already on academic probation after getting my first D last fall.  If you fall below a 2.0 during academic probation, you will be asked to take a year off from school.  I was supposed to graduate this spring, but I instead had to appeal my academic suspension in order to return to campus this fall.  I attended to my mental health this summer with a professional, and today I will be graduating after finishing with a 4.0 this semester.\n\nYour grades do not determine your self worth.  It is you that does.  Take care of yourself first and foremost, and your performance in class will follow.  You're clearly capable as you said you passed all of your other courses this semester.  I believe in you, friend.  Keep your head up, and come back strong next semester&lt;3",

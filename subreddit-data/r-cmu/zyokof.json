    "postText": "Hey CMU folks-\n\nI'm considering transfering to CMU for Envrionmental or Civil Engineering and I'm wondering what your experiences with the major at CMU have been in terms of classes/professors, advising, career development, community (what are the students like?) and practically applying what you learned in the classroom outside of the classroom. Also anything else that you think would be valuable would be helpful.\n\nThanks! I really appreciate your time :)",

            "comment": "Hey I'm a five year alumnus from the CEE undergrad program. I loved remediation and groundwater management so that was my focus. The department is pretty small, even as CMU is fairly small this is definitely one of the smaller departments. It means you get really close, which is great since most of your work will be in teams for labs and reports and such. They have dedicated undergraduate teaching professors who are there for you and take you through your tenure there up to your capstone class. You're really there to learn how to solve problems, work in teams, and write reports for different groups of people. You'll learn either how to do things technically or how to manage time/people/resources, and you'll do it while being expected to excel at one of the hardest schools in the country. If you like infrastructure development, cleaning our environment, becoming a bridge between communities and experts, being of real use to the world, I would recommend this program. \n\nYou'll also be setting yourself on track to get a PE as this is an accredited program. They have their own career fair since CMU's general fairs don't always draw the companies we'll end up at, so they made their own. I worked for a contracting company (from that job fair) for a while, got a Master's, then wound up at an environmental consulting firm.\n\nI'll add they only created the environmental degree program this past year or so, and while I'm very jealous new students get to have that, I'm also very happy new students get to have that. I can't speak for the current state of the department but I think it was a great place for me. Hopefully will be for you, too!",

The school that I'm at doesn't have a civil/environmental engineering program which has been hard. It's good to hear that it was easy for you to find a job after graduation.",

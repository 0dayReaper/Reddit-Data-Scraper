    "postText": "There are two small white vans or SUVs that are sometimes parked in front of Tepper and students are picking up food containers from them.\n\nIs this some specific delivery service?\n\nI'm asking because I tend to be walking by around lunch time on my way to campus and what ever it is smells great! (I'm cautiously guessing it's some variety of asian food) It would be a convenient option for me. It appears to be local which I'd rather support than most of the on campus options (I'm on the other side of the street for classes). \n\nTIA for the inside info!",

My one friend was in it, I don't remember how she got in I think it was through a friend. You gotta be able to order in Chinese though if I remember right, it was mostly if not only used by Chinese students.",

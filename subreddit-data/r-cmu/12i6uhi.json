    "postText": "I want to take some courses in the philosophy department and was thinking of taking formal logic this fall. I've already taken concepts and wanted to know if there was a lot of overlap between the two courses and if so, what other courses in the philosophy department I should consider. I'm also interested in taking category theory at some point, but I don't have experience with abstract algebra currently.",

            "comment": "Every programming assignment is designed to take 2-3 hours and if you pay attention in class, it shouldn\u2019t take you much longer since they\u2019re pretty simple and in Python. The exams are open notes so also not bad. Overall I didn\u2019t spend more than 4-5 hours a week outside lecture, and most of that was working on the final project which is probably the heaviest part of the class.",

We had homework assignments once every ~2 weeks, 2 exams, and a group project with some checkpoints across the semester.\n\nTo me, the biggest challenge with the course was that it was poorly administered. The project had vague instructions, and much of the more relevant course content wasn't taught until toward the end of the semester. Directions for assignments often felt too vague or indirect, and I felt like the time I spent on the assignment was on tasks that were very far removed from the content we were supposed to be learning.",

I ended up doing well though I'm not sure what percent of the content I actually retained, and I don't think the project was very valuable as an educational tool. But like I said, the difficulty I had with the assignments was not due to the content itself being difficult",

It's insane, but they pretty have to manually go and count empty spaces in order to see if things are at capacity. Because people purchase permits, even if the lot appears empty, they have to uphold the reserved spaces for permit-holders. However, with the new parking vendor and system that's being implemented through this next year, digital systems should help with managing these issues! (Also, personally, I would recommend public transit or biking as more environmentally-friendly options if possible in your situation!)  \nPlease email me any concerns at gsa-vpca@andrew.cmu.edu and I can not only get the information to folks who can do something about it but also have more anecdotes I can push admin to actually act with. Thanks!",

The buses get full even before reaching forbes and morewood between 5-7pm, leaving many stranded for 20-30+ mins till the next one arrives. I also dislike that they removed the hamburg hall bus stop which was super convenient since you could stay indoors in the winter till the bus arrives.",

I'm not sure what we can really do about that because the PRT needs to basically do a better job optimizing :/ CMU can request stuff and we've had their CEO come and speak to the GSA before, but it's kind of hard to leverage influence across a complex system outside of CMU.

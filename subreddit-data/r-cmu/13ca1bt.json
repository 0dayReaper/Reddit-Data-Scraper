    "postText": "Hello! I don't go to CMU, but I'll be in Pittsburgh for an internship this Summer. I was wondering if anyone might be looking to sublet an apartment over the next few months.\n\nTo give some info about myself, I'm a 19 year old guy, and I go to Penn State. I'll be in Pittsburgh from the middle of May- next week- until the beginning of August, and I'm open to making arrangements for some or all of that timespan. I'm most concerned about finding housing for the first few weeks of my internship, though. I don't drink or smoke, and I wouldn't be bringing any pets or other stuff that would violate the terms of a lease. I would strongly prefer an apartment with access to a parking spot and single bedroom, but I'm open to other situations as well.\n\nIf you or anyone you know is still looking for someone to sublet to, feel free to reach out! My PMs are open, and I'm willing to negotiate a bit as far as rent goes.",

I consider him the smartest man Soarch has, and the biggest shoes to fill since his semi-retirement. The entire IW on top of MMCH is his crowning achievement in building science and research. \n\nMattern has the uncanny ability to reduce complicated talk of BTU's into simple math. Has a sense of humor, which makes his lectures more relatable. Ask him about the one student's report and calculations for the Turkeys on the moon assignment....",

The title sounds dry but the course was very engaging and relevant material on general public policy topics that are interesting as just a person that lives in a society. Especially focused on the intersection between markets and government. Also talked about voting, globalization, technological change, health insurance marketplaces and their value and issues, welfare programs, economic history in disadvantaged areas, and other topics that get touched by public policy as well as what makes policy more or less effective. This was in the Top 3 best classes I ever took at CMU. Definitely would recommend. And there's a good amount of discussion and other activities - it's not just a lecture every day.",

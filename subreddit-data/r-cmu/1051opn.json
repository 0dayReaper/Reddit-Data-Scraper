I\u2019ve read reviews and heard that the older buildings tend not to get the same quality of service as the newer ones, so YMMV.",

The manager assigned to my unit was terrible, but my friends who had someone else had a good experience.  \nSquirrel Hill Flats: 8/10. The landlord Mr. Schwartz was prompt in all repairs and building upkeep. By far my best experience but the apartments are fairly expensive relative to their size. Heating was not included so that made things pricey as well  \nMozart: 6.5/10. Overall fine. Places are reasonably priced. The main issue is the cleanliness of common areas, and the occurrence of pests every summer.",

He has been a superstar landlord for me and is just a great guy - excellent and honest communication, fast maintenance, good prices for the size, units are well-kept, and they are all located in a stellar neighborhood. You can message me for contact info. He usually builds out his list of available leases in early April. I'm graduating this year so my lease will be free too.",

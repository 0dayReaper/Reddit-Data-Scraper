    "postText": "I am an incoming Ph.D. student to CMU for next year. I currently have an electric vehicle and it seems charging is available on campus in some places. In particular, the CIC garage seems rather close to my potential future office. Would it be possible for one to obtain a permit to that garage easily, and are permits generally easy for grad students to buy? Upon perusing the website for the parking permits, I am left with more questions than answers really. For other fellow students with EVs how do you guys manage? There seems to be scant affordable apartments with charging as an option.",

I gave up my permit during COVID, and if I reapply for a new one, I go to the bottom of the list.\n\nIt looks like from the info [on the parking site](https://www.cmu.edu/parking/park/index.html), you can charge your EV in the campus garages without having a permit by booking time with an app, but you still pay the garage rate. Your CMU ID will be a bus pass, and if you live close enough to make use of that and/or the campus shuttles, driving isn't worth the hassle and the expense",

Would you happen to know how long one could expect to wait in the waiting list? I think perhaps for my first year, I might live somewhere closer with public transport and hope for the best later.",

It's been a little bit looser since the pandemic because a lot of people were fully or partially working from home, but now we've been called back to work from campus  for at least three days a week starting next semester. Many staff and faculty who might have given up their permits may be back on the waitlist themselves.",

Having lived in Pittsburgh for a while now, the COL stayed somewhat reasonable until COVID. I would say it is now a more significant problem and is something grad students are going to have to play \"catch up\" with, which is hard. For example, there are certain neighborhoods that I'd heard were great grad student neighborhoods, and they might have been years ago. Currently, however, a 400 sq foot studio apt with no pets and no assigned parking will run you $900/month ***without*** utilities in said \"grad student friendly\" neighborhoods.\n\nETA: the permits cost over $200 a semester I believe (I haven't checked, though) and adding that to the other costs of daily life is just ... wildly difficult.",

Normally different campus factions vie to paint the fence over the normal school year. \nA lot of people aren't part of those factions, but still want to paint the fence (because it's fun and cool). Problem is, it's normally hard to do that as you're competing with a lot of other groups during the year that want to paint and you need to get a possey of other painters to help.",

It was a much more convenient way to hold possession of the fence if you wanted it for more than one day. Hand offs to the next group were usually arranged ahead of time (I assume this still happens).",

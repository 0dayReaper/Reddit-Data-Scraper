            "comment": "After (almost) 2 years I am definitely enjoying the classes and learning a lot despite it being a ton of work. That being said you will not get to designing analog circuitry or other devices unless you do personal projects or join a club like CMR, RoboClub, or [RoboSub](https://tartanauv.com) (which is what I do). You also get a free Altium license with your email which can allow you to just make things if you wanted to. There are plenty of opportunities to speak with professors about their work or research opportunities and they may be able to help you find something. If you\u2019re interested in analog and end up here then take 18-220 and 18-290 as your first core ECE classes.\nThere is definitely a reason why CMU is considered as one of the top schools you can go to for this major. As with any program though, you get a lot out of it by doing things other than just going to class.",

            "comment": "For analog, it can take a bit to get anywhere. I feel like CMU has to take a lot of analog stuff super slow, especially in the core \u201canalog\u201d class, 220, since so many people are just focused on software and computer engineering. The intro course is around 1/2 - 2/3 circuits, but then switches over to computer stuff towards the end. 220 then ends up being half review of the intro class, which is quite annoying especially if you come in with a decent amount of analog knowledge. Essentially you\u2019ll go through 2 ECE classes and learn only a thing here and there depending on your background\n\nOnce you get into maybe spring sophomore year and can take 320, then you start to somewhat get into interesting things in my opinion. Even then there\u2019s still some people that don\u2019t care for analog, since 320 is also partially digital microelectronics, but it\u2019s significantly better I\u2019d say.\n\nYou also mentioned medical devices. Professor Maysam Chamanzar does research in optical neural probes and things along those lines. He also has an undergrad/grad class called nanobiophotnics which is all about using optics/light for medical sensing applications\n\nFor personal projects, there\u2019s the Robotics Club. Roboclub has a room in the UC with 3d printers, a laser cutter, hand/power tools, and a mill+lathe. They also have lots of parts that you can use for projects if you\u2019re a member, and if you need a part they don\u2019t have, you can put in a project request to get up to a few hundred dollars for a project idea that you have.",

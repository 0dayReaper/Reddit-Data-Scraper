I have yet to commit to CMU (but most likely will) and so I don't have a counselor assigned to me. Who can I email to negotiate a potential course pardon?",

I found that 259 (esp if Clive teaches it) really delves a lot deeper than the book/high school material. In my experience, taking and TA'ing 259 was very different from taking calc in high school, despite using the same textbook and I would definitely recommend not skipping 259. Obviously this is my own experience/opinion so take this with a grain of salt :)",

As someone who took the course tho it was way harder than the 3d calc I did in high school (and my high school\u2019s 3d calc class was pretty solid)\u2026 so if having that math background is important to you I would probably recommend you take it. You could also consider taking one of the higher-level versions, such as 21-266 (vector calc for CS people), 21-268 (multidimensional calc with extra matrices fun stuff), or 21-269 (multidimensional calc for cracked people).",

I took dual enrollment multivariable calculus and linear algebra with another university, but they wouldn't accept transfer credits, and for good reason. the rigor and depth of CMU's math courses is more than what you'd usually get in a high school setting, and it's definitely worth it imo to take the course even if you know the material!",

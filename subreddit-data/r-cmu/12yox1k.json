    "postText": "Hi, so I\u2019m petty. I was accepted into the school of art at CMU and am planning to attend! Super excited. So in saying that I\u2019m more of a humanities/ art/ business kinda person and not so much stem.\n\n\nSo yesterday, I was talking to a friend and he was joking how I wasn\u2019t going to make money with art and like other things that we joke about. But one thing struck a chord, when I made a comment about maybe experimenting in CS he laughed and said something along the lines of, \u201cha, you in Carnegie Mellon cs? I would start to question how good the program was\u201d and continued on about \u201cknowing your strengths and sticking to it\u201d\n\nNow, Ik I\u2019m not a stem girl but I\u2019ll be dammed if I let someone tell me what I am not capable of. I don\u2019t want him to apologize, I want revenge, I want blood. \n\nSo, with all that being said what resources do y\u2019all suggest for me to learn the fundamentals to succeed for at least a couple of classes in CS in Carnegie Mellon. Ik there\u2019s an introductory course at CMU and I\u2019ve found some resources online but Ik CS is hard and especially at CMU so any advice would help \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\n\nThank you in advance!",

By the end of the semester long class, a complete beginner to programming should be able to code and animate sudoku and tetris from nothing. That includes solving a sudoku board in milliseconds, which is pretty cool. Basically everyone, including non-stem majors, take the class",

As well as a number of art courses that integrated computer aided design (Digital Fabrication, Kinetic Sculpture, CAD with the Design College) \n\nThere are lots of opportunity to test the waters of programmatic and generative art especially through courses offered at the [STUDIO for Creative Inquiry](https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/) If you fall in love with the idea of staying on a CS track there is also the BCSA program \"Bachelors of Computer Science and Art\" in the [BXA department](https://www.cmu.edu/interdisciplinary/programs/)\n\nCollege is 100% the time to experiment with these possibilities and there is a lot of help offered, especially to non-majors. GO TO OFFICE HOURS if you are struggling. Teaching Assistants are there to help and they enjoy helping folks. I would not have got through these courses without assistance. There is no shame in it. \n\nSome things you will be successful in, some things will be a struggle but anyone who questions the rigor, or the difficulty that comes with any and all majors at CMU has not experienced it. The university is one of the most prestigious in the country and it earns that reputation in spades. \n\nYour art program will also not be easy. But you can handle it! Good Luck!",

(I will caution you that 112 uses a slightly different graphics framework now, and the content it covers changes slightly every semester.) 112 doesn\u2019t assume prior knowledge, though, so you don\u2019t necessarily need to self study to do well and get a lot out of it.\n\nGood luck!!",

Computer science is, historically, and really ought to conduct itself as a melting-pot discipline.  \"Thinking like a computer scientist\", by which I mean building and using (and knowing when to violate!) *abstractions* to design and understand complex things, is a general skill and we should be striving to make it available to anyone.  Dually, without *things* to think about, which largely come from other disciplines, computer science would just be a weird little branch of mathematics.  (I am, perhaps, a little jaded, having been a physicist who hung around CS people before getting that degree, too.)\n\nOthers have said that 15-112, the introduction to the task of *coding*, is available online, and while knowing how to code is absolutely important (and there are so, so many language to choose from; don't get discouraged if you find that you don't like the first one you try!), you might also want to devote some time to the *theory* side.  You say you're not a STEM person, so I'm not sure what you'd consider your mathematical background to be, but the textbook for 15-151 is also available online at [https://infinitedescent.xyz/dl/infdesc.pdf](https://infinitedescent.xyz/dl/infdesc.pdf) and looks pretty good!  Even CS people occasionally discount math, but it's excellent training for *abstraction* and the *art* of matching problems to one's available tools.\n\nYou didn't say what kind of art you do, but you might want to reach out to my friend [https://www.morphingmatter.cs.cmu.edu/people/lea](https://www.morphingmatter.cs.cmu.edu/people/lea) if the kinds of things she does appeal.  There's also [https://ideate.cmu.edu/facilities/index.html](https://ideate.cmu.edu/facilities/index.html) with resources for digital fabrication and shoving little computers into real-world objects (\"physical computing\").  If music's more your thing, there's [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/\\~music/](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/) (perhaps most well known for their robotic bagpipe player... it's definitely a CMU thing.)\n\nIf I can be of further assistance, please ask.",

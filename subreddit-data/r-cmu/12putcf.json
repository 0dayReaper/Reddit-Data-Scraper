    "postText": "Hi\n\nI have a really bad registration time(sophomore at 4pm) and am not a CS major, so I am trying to have as many options as possible for a systems course in the fall. I am currently trying to decide which systems course to take in the fall(having only taken 213) and am struggling to decide between the following courses. Does anyone have any thoughts on the structure of these, their professors, TAs, and OH, or the assignments?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n15-441: I have heard/read good things about this course, one being from this legend [here,](https://fanpu.io/blog/2022/cmu-computer-networks-review/) but I have not heard much else about it because I think it is less popular than the other two mentioned.\n\n15-440: This seems like the most common systems course; I do not know Go but I have heard this course, like 445, is also very applicable to stuff I may encounter outside of CMU. I also have not seen much about this in the fall.\n\n15-445: I do not know C++(would it be really hard to learn from zero knowledge?) but have heard many good things about this course's applicability and its professor,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny input is greatly appreciated !",

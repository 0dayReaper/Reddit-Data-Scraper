But regardless, 50 miles is quite far for the chemicals to disperse to an undetectable level.  And if it travels fast,  the wind would have blown it all out of the area by now anyway.  I guess there could be some residual trace amounts deposited in surfaces but that has to be incredibly small amount. \n\nThe cone of dispersion between the accident and cmu is around 500 square miles.  Assuming dispersion vertically in the atmosphere up to 5000 feet and you get the equivalent volume of 500 trillion gallons and assuming 10,000 gallons were dispersed that is 1 molecule per 50 billion molecules in the air.  That is safe by a factor of 100,000 times under OSHA limit of 5 ppm and would be pushed out of the are by the wind in a day or so.",

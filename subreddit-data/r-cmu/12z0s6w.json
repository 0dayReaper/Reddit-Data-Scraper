    "postText": "Hey all, I'm an incoming student who wants to take the CS placement exam. I don't have credit for AP CSA because my high school doesn't offer it, but I have quite a bit of experience doing competitive programming in C++. I'm having a hard time finding information about what specific topics are tested on the exam (except for the fact that the exam consists of 20 MCQs in Java), so I'd really appreciate it if anyone here could provide more information.",

I've made lifelong CMU friends, but I also felt like we were always so stressed we only truly enjoyed our friendships after leaving. I had to work three work study jobs while attending because it was so expensive, but I feel like all those jobs were very valuable experiences. I felt equally alienated and understood by faculty and fellow students. \n\nA lot of this is pretty CMU specific, butt a lot is also just the college experience.\n\nNow nearly a decade after leaving, my negative feelings have largely melted away and I'm grateful to have attended. You should go wherever you think matches your life philosophy and interests.",

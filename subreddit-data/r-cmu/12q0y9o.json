If you want to do ML on the edge/in the real world, it's a great class to take (we had a guest lecturer from a dude who does edge ML at Apple and his content seemed similar to what we studied). \n\nThat said make sure you have a good group for the group project. Like in many of these ML courses here, if you don't have a group that is willing to work you're in for a bad time.",

Are they very theoretical or practical?\n3. How interesting and engaging are your cs/ml courses? Are they very theoretical or practical?\n4. Are the GenEd requirements an annoying amount of work? Are they at all interesting? Should I just pick the lowest FCE hour ones and try to get them over with?\n5. Do you still have to study for like more than 3 hours a week for GenEd classes? \n\nfrom a prospective student, any input would be amazing :)",

I don\u2019t think these 2 classes are very theoretical at all, 122 teaches many basic data structures\n\n4. They\u2019re easy, and interesting enough for gen Ed\u2019s imo. Grand challenge seminar kind of sucks but I chose a mid topic so it\u2019s also on me. Currently taking microecon as well and it\u2019s pretty trivial\n\n5. No",

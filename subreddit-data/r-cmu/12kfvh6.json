    "postText": "I'm currently a CS sophomore and thinking about what my first systems class should be. I want to maximize learning and doing interesting courses that would be helpful in software engineering life.\n\n15440:I heard that this was the most applicable class to real-world applications since everything is distributed nowadays. The fall is in Go, and I'm a big Go fan. I heard it's better in the fall. I heard it's one of the easier system classes, and I know many people planning to take it (albeit most just want the credit). I also did some stuff in the summer relating to this field, so it might be good to actually get an understanding of what is happening. A high-level overview of how systems interact, a solid option.  \n\n\n15441:I've very good things about this class, particularly from [this post.](https://fanpu.io/blog/2022/cmu-computer-networks-review/) I look up to the guy and he's a genius, so I imagine I would get some good value from here. It would cover weak points in knowledge. Quant related since learning about a bottleneck? Also seems very interesting. Haven't gotten to do many low-level internals about the internet. The problem is I worry how much practicality I'd lose if I had just taken distributed. Also, fce is slightly higher, but it doesn't really matter if the course is interesting.\n\nThe only other hard course I'm taking is 210, and then a bunch of geneds. Please let me know your thoughts. Thanks!",

I would suggest just taking networks.\n\nI wouldn't be that concerned about practicality -- lots of people in the world who have never taken a CMU course but are doing just fine. You can read up on some of the key ideas in distributed on your own (e.g., vector clocks, paxos, raft) to get a general idea.",

I do think CS student should know things like computer architecture(how cpu really works) ,OS and network though you will probably never have to deal with them in your future career unless you are making low level optimization. Anyway both are good courses so you can definitely take another one later.",

I heard all CS courses are extremely difficult and students dont generally have time to do part time jobs or anything. Can someone please let me know their thoughts about the program?",

Feel free to DM me if you want to chat about the program/courses, I\u2019ve picked up a good amount of info just from being an undergrad here and from my previous ML classes. Congrats!",

You'd be taking a single bedroom with a queen-sized bed for 1.9k-2.2k/mo or a single bedroom with a sofa bed + really large desk for \\~1.4-1.5k/mo.\n\nThe house is a fully furnished 3bd 2.5ba townhouse, with a pool and a park nearby, and the owners are the sweetest people! Pls dm me for the video tour. We love the unit and think everyone else will too -- but we can't hold onto it for very long.\n\na little about us: CS juniors from UC Berkeley and Columbia interning at LinkedIn :)",

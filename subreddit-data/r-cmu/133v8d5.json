Five lounges per floor, first floor is one massive game lounge/kitchen/reading rooms/hangout spaces. It\u2019s where you want to be. \n\nMorewood E-tower isn\u2019t bad either! But I\u2019ve RA\u2019ed a bunch &amp; stever seems to be the winner",

My own bathroom? Big room? Amazing. But I was wrong.\n\nMorewood gardens is set up to be an upperclassmen dorm (minimal community spaces, hard to communicate with floor, more personal space) and that\u2019s awful as a first year bc it makes it 10X harder to meet people and make friends.\n\nI only truly realized this once I RA\u2019ed at Stever and Donner and saw how *good* the first year experience can be in traditional dorms. Everyone knows everyone, loads of events every week, and the entire building is first years. It\u2019s awesome.\n\nMorewood gardens is meant for people who already have their friends sorted out and want to prioritize space over socializing. Great for upperclassman! Awfully hard for first years.",

I also think Stever\u2019s smaller size made it more close-knit, and a lot of people I met from the lounges are people I still see from time to time.\n\nI stayed in Morewood for my sophomore year and it\u2019s not bad, but I more highly recommend Stever for the freshman year experience ;)",

If your friend don't post something like these.  I suggest you to enlarge social circle. It was like I immersed into propaganda the whole day with terrorism.  The comments above also discuss about that. Some people in China really are misleaded by propaganda.  It is an honor that you and your friend are reasonable.  For people in HK,  they are suffering the most terrible suppression since 1967. Tear gas are everywhere.  It's hard to say who are the most tolerant group except establishing an independent commission.  So discussing whether HK protestors are rioters are really meaningless.",

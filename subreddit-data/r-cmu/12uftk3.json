    "postText": "Hi all, I\u2019m trying to quickly gather some takes on whether this would be too much to take in 1 semester as a fall sophomore: 213, 150, 21241, 36235.

(bc 241 w Irina &amp; 235 is a little unpredictable for next sem)\n\nFor context, I\u2019m handling 122/concepts pretty well rn. I\u2019m just worried if this schedule would be pushing too far.

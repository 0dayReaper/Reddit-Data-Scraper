            "comment": "Non-engineer here, but I'll give my two cents.\n\nThe bad news is that there's no aerospace engineering here. You could probably do some sort of double between Engineering and Physics, though I'm not sure how common / possible it is to do engineering as an additional major.\n\nThe good news is that for most jobs you'd probably want with an Aerospace Engineering degree, you're better off with a MechE degree*. My understanding is that a MechE's curriculum generally tends to be a superset of what Aerospace Engineers learn, or at least the additional stuff in the Aerospace curriculum isn't all that useful compared to what you miss from not being a MechE. To my knowledge, that's exactly why CMU doesn't offer an Aerospace degree in the first place. There are still many exciting engineering projects going on here that involve space (and air, lol), so you wouldn't be missing out on research opportunities or anything. For more info on research, you can look up CMU Moonranger or CMU IRIS. I also know multiple CMU students/alums who have gone on to work or intern at SpaceX, and I imagine many CMU students similarly end up at other aerospace companies - there's a graduate careers website somewhere where you can find more detailed info on that.\n\nIf you do choose CMU, you should probably talk with an academic advisor ASAP to figure out how to get the education you're looking for. My bet is that most likely, you'll want to transfer into COE and pursue MechE.\n\n*If you're 100% certain that the line of work you're considering really does prefer Aerospace over MechE (idk what it'd be but maybe like designing airplanes or something?), then maybe it's worth going somewhere else that does offer Aerospace. I'm from Maryland, so I've had a good number of friends pass through UMD engineering, and you definitely wouldn't be in a bad spot going there instead. Though CMU almost certainly holds an edge for job placement and brand name, regardless of where in aerospace you're looking",

You don\u2019t need to go anywhere else to get a career in aero!! Loads of my friends (all Engineering, TBF) are in the Aerospace industry from CMU. But I would consider doubling with an engineering major",

            "comment": "I would evaluate what area in aerospace you hold an interest. I came in with a strong preference towards aerospace, but ended up doing ECE/Robotics and completing aerospace projects on the side. There are definitely in campus labs (AirLab, MoonRanger, etc.) that tackle aviation and adjacent topics. You can also always participate in an external aviation competition with other folks here.\n\nUltimately, your degree is what you make of it. It's very possible to pursue aerospace at CMU despite the lack of designated degree. It also lets you be an expert in a core area within aerospace (say avionics) rather than just knowing broad info on the matter.",

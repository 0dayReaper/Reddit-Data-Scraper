Insist on 8 hours of sleep, find healthy snacks that taste good to you, and exercise 3 or 4 times per week. You will accomplish more, not less. (And you'll be happier!)",

If you don't end up with any time for play, then try again because it's a crucial part of self-care. You aren't thriving if you aren't having fun.\n\n2. For snacks, try different kinds of nuts, trail mix, carrots with hummus, berries, jerky, and dates. Especially try to avoid using desserts as snacks. Also, you can have electric kettles, portable induction stoves, rice makers, microwaves, and slow cookers in your rooms (just nothing with a flame). No need to have them all, but consider getting one or two that will make it easier for you to pick healthier eating options\u2014and remember that the keywords are *easier* and *healthier.*\n\n3. Consider signing up for the 1-credit pass-fail exercise courses. They meet 3 times per week for about an hour, and there's no homework or performance requirements. I liked swimming, but they've got a surprising number of other sport and fitness options. Also, the gyms are free and /r/fitness is a great resource.",

                                    "comment": "A big reason why I'm so uppity about getting enough sleep is because several of my psychology professors dedicated a significant amount of time to telling us the following:\n\n1. How much everybody underestimates the dangers of sleep deprivation and overestimates their knowledge about the importance of sleep.\n2. How little it takes for sleep deprivation to begin.\n2. How even just one day of missing only a couple hours has tangible, measurable effect on just about everything you can think of (attention, memory formation, task completion, weight change, muscle maintenance, reaction time, self-reported amount of daily \"energy,\" observed amount of daily activity, willpower, test performance, stress, anxiety, mood, ability to experience enjoyment...)\n4. How quickly the effects accumulate.\n5. How long the effects persist even if you (wisely) sleep a bit more than what you normally need.\n6. How rare nights of inadequate sleep need to be to prevent small portions of those negative effects from becoming long-term and/or permanent damage.\n7. How quickly those small portions accumulate.\n7. How all many terrifying neurological disorders become much more likely for people who don't get enough sleep, and have a higher chance of happening earlier in life. (Have you ever thought about how terrifying and awful it must be to suffer from dementia or Alzheimer's? Like, *really* imagined what it would be like? And that's just the tip of the iceberg.)\n\nBasically, the psych professors\u2014especially my first one\u2014scared the crap out of us. And of course they had tons of studies and meta-studies to back up what they were saying. (I regret not saving those references.)\n\nEver since then, I've been in utter disbelief that society is so casually accepting of things like college students not getting enough sleep, forcing kids and teenagers to wake up early for school, and pretty much anything else that interferes with sleep. It's insane. We're all insane.\n\nWho knows how much smarter, faster, healthier, and just generally *better* I could've been if somebody had told me all this earlier?\n\nAnd who knows how many world-changing ideas could've happened if our brightest minds performed that much better, stayed that much healthier, or lived that much longer?\n\nIt makes me angry to think about.\n\nAnyway, I hope I've been able to do the equivalent of shaking everyone here by the shoulders to make you all see how dangerous sleep deprivation really is, and how much society underestimates it. If I was even 10% as sobering as any of my psych professors, then *good.*\n\n**tl;dr Getting a *full* 8 hours *every* night needs to be everybody's *top* priority when it comes to time management. If you aren't terrified of sleep deprivation, then you're severely underestimating sleep deprivation.**\n\nOkay! Next, let's cover the horrors of dehydration, and how incredibly crucial it is that you drink more water throughout the day if your urine isn't completely clear or at least nearly colorless... ;)",

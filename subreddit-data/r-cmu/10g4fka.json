These programs are just cash cows in the first place. If you want to do a research masters at a good school, you need to have done research beforehand in order to get in. This is where doing your undergrad at CMU may have actually hurt you. You had more chances to get involved in CS research than students at basically any other school. The fact that you didn't take advantage of these opportunities is going to be viewed negatively by admissions committees. This isn't totally fair, as there are economic and mental health-based reasons that a student might not be able to get involved in research. But that is how these committees see things.",

Don't worry about going to OH or anything. Just get an A in some hard classes and ask those profs for rec letters at the end of the semester. The prof will know what to write because this is literally their job.",

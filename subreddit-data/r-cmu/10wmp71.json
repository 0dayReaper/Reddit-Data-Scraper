    "postText": "I am in a position where I am tempted to renege an internship offer from a company. I understand that regardless of how I go about it I will probably burn a bridge with the company, but was wondering if there are any other possible implications from reneging an offer as a  CMU student - for example the company getting cmu involved or something or reaching out to other companies and sharing this with them, or basically anything that could ruin my reputation.",

Word gets around. \n\nIt's not fair as companies in the real world can ghost you during the interview process or outright cancel your internship after you've made arrangements to do it and it's no penalty on the companies; but yeah, going back on your word and not doing the internship you agreed to can have an impact on your career prospects. \n\nIf you need to do it, then be sure to have a solid reason and a sincere apologetic tone so there's no hard feelings and they can't do anything in retaliation without looking like the bad guy, ie. a family medical emergency or other unexpected situation that you can't avoid handling at the moment.",

            "comment": "it can depend on the company. i know one where someone reneged at a consulting company and the hiring manager was just like shucks and moved on. I know investment firms taking reneging more seriously and spread word around to other companies, so I'd imagine more older, conservative companies may have a higher risk of reneging. I've also heard of someone reneging at a bank (not major one but not small either) and it turned out fine, but their explanation was 'for personal reasons'. The bridge is likely temporarily burned, no one is going to keep track of you for too long, you could probably reapply in about 5 years or so or sooner depending on how much the company cares",

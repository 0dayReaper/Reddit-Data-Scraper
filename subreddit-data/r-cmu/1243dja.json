    "postText": "I was just accepted for CS and just recently saw some people mentioning the work load and social life at CMU for a CS major. The only other school I\u2019m considering is not not nearly as known for their CS but would definitely have a good social scene with good support along with it. For anyone who is currently studying or studied engineering/ CS at CMU, could you drop some more info on the school and somethings you wish you knew before you attended the school?\n\n\nThank you!",

If you have a lot of experience already with computer science you will be fine. The workload is heavy, but the bigger issue is the professors assume a base of knowledge from the students and not everyone has it.  Maybe that\u2019s changed as there is a lot more opportunity to learn programming before college and I assume it\u2019s a big criteria for admissions now. As far as the campus social scene, it\u2019s not great.  Your classmates become your friends, especially the ones you click with on group projects.  Greek life is an option or join some clubs.  If you are not big on drugs/drinking, AEPi used to be a dry frat, not sure if it still is. The career center is excellent and the type of companies that recruit on campus are of a high caliber.",

CS, ECE, IS, you name it. Even those with no AP CS in high school, no prior internships, and hadn\u2019t programmed before college.\n\nThe CMU name is really a big deal, if you can put in the work to maintain a decent GPA and have a life alongside it. But as others here have elaborated, it is not an easy time.",

Don\u2019t worry about social life, and because of the heavy workload that everyone is gonna take on, you\u2019re going to get a close knit group of friendships that you\u2019re gonna treasure for life. In my opinion, CMU kids study hard AND play pretty hard too. \n\nI graduated five years ago. Never once have I ever regretted not going to a party vs studying on my desk finishing homework. That\u2019s the fruitful memory you\u2019re going to remember years down the line.",

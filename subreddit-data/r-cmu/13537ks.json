    "postText": "Hi! Since there's not a ton of recent info about this on the internet, I was wondering if any students who are currently studying neuroscience (or similar) for undergrad could share their experiences. What is the major like? How many classes are you taking per semester? How many hours do you spend studying per day? Any advice in general?\n\nThanks!!",

            "comment": "hi, i'm a comp neuro student graduating this sem!\n\nthe major is pretty cool, the classes you can take range from neural signal processing (monkey datasets pog) to modeling information accumulation for decision making to let's dissect this eyeball and interview someone with brain lesions. something for everyone interested in neuroscience, and because your classes can span a lot of different departments (bio, bme, psych, cs) you'll learn a lot of ways to think about the mind. if you're at all interested in research it'd be worth it to check out the cnbc website, many professors at cmu/pitt are conducting really cool research in neuroscience and a lot of them are pretty chill about taking in undergraduates.\n\ni would say the major is pretty flexible (three different concentrations, with not too many course requirements to graduate) -- i feel like a lot of people here find it easy to finish within four years without really having to go over maybe like 45ish fce per semester (which translates to \\~45 hrs per week of work), it's also definitely possible to graduate early if you want/need to.\n\nbut how many hours per week you'll work in a semester really varies by what classes you end up taking, even if you have similar fces for those semesters. some semesters i took almost all psych intro courses and didn't really study at all, some semesters i would be working on my homework til the sun came up. if you're planning to do research or are taking some harder courses during a semester, you'll maybe find yourself working... a lot.\n\nmy biggest advice personally would be to learn how to pace yourself. no matter what classes you're taking, what gpa you want, or how many jobs you want to apply to, you're still human and deserve peace, rest, and relaxation to stay sane and productive. (there's no award for burning out, so be nice to yourself.) as a freshman or sophomore especially i feel like its easier to struggle with this, but no need to be hard on yourself about it because college (cmu especially) can be a big adjustment. trying to keep some lighter classes in your schedule along with harder ones is the easiest way to set yourself up for a sustainable level of productivity, but still be sure to check in with yourself. (in hindsight i should've spaced out some of my psych classes more because they were quite the breath of fresh air)\n\nedit: also feel free to dm with any questions or whatnot",

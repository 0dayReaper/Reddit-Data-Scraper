    "postText": "Because CMU sends too many emails (would be nice if they coordinated between departments). Figured I'd summarize as I force myself to read through all of it.\n\n**TLDR of TLDR**: \n\n- Submit SIO survey asap, [link](https://s3.andrew.cmu.edu/sio/mpa/myinfo/survey)\n- Submit booster docs by Feb 16, [link](https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/vaccine/vaccine-database.html)\n- Take a baseline test when you're back in Pittsburgh and if you're negative you don't need to do anything, if you're positive go [here](https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/health-and-wellness/symptoms-and-reporting.html#positive)\n- Figure out what your course modalities on SIO. IPO/PER/REO (if you're not IPO, Jan 18 to Jan 30 is remote)\n- Wear a mask on campus\n\nEdit:\n\n- If you already caught COVID, you do not need to do a baseline test, **but** you must [report](https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/health-and-wellness/symptoms-and-reporting.html#positive) your positive diagnosis\n\n---\n\nDo this:\n\n1. By ???, login to SIO and do the [survey](https://s3.andrew.cmu.edu/sio/mpa/myinfo/survey). Double-check that your \"local residence address, permanent address, mobile phone, and emergency contact information\" are correct. [0]\n  - Commentary: Historically, you get locked out of SIO eventually if you don't do their surveys.\n2. By Feb 16, upload your booster documentation to [HealthConnect](https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/vaccine/vaccine-database.html), click Submit Documentation Now. [1]\n  - You can register for boosters [here](https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/vaccine/index.html).\n  - You can submit requests for vaccine exemption or vaccine booster exemption, but you'll need to do: daily self-assessment, weekly tartan testing, and of course wear a mask. If you fall into this category for some reason, read [1].\n  - Commentary: Pitt just dis-enrolled people who didn't do any of the above. I wonder if CMU will be as bold.\n3. **After** returning to Pittsburgh, take a baseline test. This can be done through Tartan Testing or an at-home test. [2]\n  - If your test is negative, you don't need to do anything.\n  - If your test is positive, follow these [instructions](https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/health-and-wellness/symptoms-and-reporting.html#positive).\n  - **Edit:** If you already caught COVID, you do not need to do a baseline test. But you must [report](https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/health-and-wellness/symptoms-and-reporting.html#positive) your positive diagnosis. [2]\n  - Commentary: It appears there's nothing _making_ you take a baseline test, but please take one anyway. If you check [3] the [COVID Dashboard](https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/health-and-wellness/dashboard.html), CMU had an all-time high of cases last week, more than we've ever had. [Image](https://imgur.com/a/qHndbwD).\n      - *mumble mumble what is the point of pushing back the semester start mumble lookit me I'm such a smart alumni yall are sheeps mumble*\n      - More seriously, it does look like cases are flattening out quickly, so barring any people intentionally spreading COVID to prove a point and assuming that people are somewhat responsible, in-person in February without any significant fraction of the CMU population catching any form of COVID seems realistic.\n\nGoing forward, information courtesy of [0]:\n\n- Jan 18 - 30 is remote unless your course is explicitly listed on SIO as IPO (In-Person Only). Afterwards,\n- Go to SIO schedule for the [current semester](https://s3.andrew.cmu.edu/sio/mpa/semesterschedule?view=list&amp;semester=S22), click the (i) bubble for each course.\n  - IPE = In-Person Expectation = you should attend in-person by default.\n  - PER = in-Person-Expectation Rotation = (directly ripped from the advisors, thanks!) PER is IPE with \"rotation\", which means once we are back in person for most courses, you are expected to attend in person, but only a subset of the class will attend in person each day, and these subsets will rotate through required attendance in person; on days when you are not in person, the instructor will provide a recording or other material. (e.g. 1/2 the class might attend in person on Tuesday and 1/2 on Thursday if the course meets TR.) Your instructor will explain once we return to in-person instruction.\n  - REO = REmote-Only = this course will only be run remotely.\n  - Note that all remote sessions are expected to run **synchronously** by default (so you need to show up during class time).\n\nAFAIK this is all you need to do and know. Corrections welcome.\n\n---\n\nAlso, because current grocery store prices are _wack_, some financial resources for anyone that might need them (thanks to GSA for sending out great emails):\n\n- [TESF](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/loans/index.html): \"unforeseeable expenses related to the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. travel, moving expenses, medication, food requiring immediate assistance). Approved TESF support **does not require repayment**; however, students receiving these funds are responsible for any potential tax implications\"\n- [CMU pantry](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/resources/cmu-pantry/index.html): **need-blind**, and you can email them if you need any kind of help getting stuff (e.g., quarantined, ill).\n\n---\n\n[0] SCS Piazza  \n[1] https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/news-and-communications/communications-archive/2022/january/please-upload-your-booster-information-into-the-database-today.html  \n[2] https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/faqs/spring-arrival.html  \n[3] https://www.cmu.edu/coronavirus/health-and-wellness/dashboard.html",

            "comment": "Honestly, though, what is the point of baseline testing? You're only gonna do it once, what are the odds it is gonna catch exactly the \\~7 days at which you have covid? (Even less so, if you assume it only applies to asymptomatic infection which is harder to detect, and that the test is not perfectly sensitive throughout the infection)\n\nIf you arrive on campus and don't do it on your first or second day (which seems not doable anyway, because there aren't enough appointments), you'll already have infected a bunch of people at that point.\n\nAnd again, not to mention that that will be only a single test at a single point in time. If you catch covid at any other point, which seems overwhelmingly more likely (especially after in person resumes), the test would be useless.",

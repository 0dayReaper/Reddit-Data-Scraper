    "postText": "trigger warning: suicide\n\nI am an undergrad studying at the Pittsburgh campus. I have been struggling with depression, anxiety, among other mental illnesses and I have been nothing but transparent with CMU, hoping they could support me. This semester I have been hospitalized twice at a mental institution. After my first hospitalization, there was little support offered by CMU, the follow-up with CAPS has a month's worth of wait time and I felt like no one was there for me. I tried to off myself again because of that and was taken in by the hospital yet again.\n\nTo my surprise, the student affairs office sent me a mandate letter basically listing 5 conditions I'd have to follow, or else they will revoke my student status and put me on administrative leave, without ever attempting to reach out to me personally. Besides this, CMU also shared my medical information with my parents' friend without my consent and caused me a great deal of distress while I was in the hospital. I have tried every route before committing s\\*\\*cide, I have reached out to CAPS, I have called the local support lines, I did everything listed on my safety plan, and I was immediately put on wait for at least 40 minutes. It is discouraging and very upsetting how poorly CMU has handled this, and the fact that they threw a cold mandate letter to my face while I was still in the hospital is just unacceptable.\n\nCan someone please help me because I need support from others right now and I am lost? I need to find some department at CMU that will stand up for me and respect me, could someone please provide some resources (eg. student advocate, legal assistance, where to file a HIPAA complaint, student groups, and club that can help me, etc)? I'm sorry this post is awfully negative, I hope everyone can have a nice holiday and stay healthy.\n\nedit: I am not saying that I expect CMU to be fully responsible for my mental health treatment, I have medical support from the hospital and other organizations and I am very clear on what steps I need to take in order to recover from this crisis. I am simply writing this post because as a student, I feel like I am not receiving support from CMU AT ALL, and not only that, I feel like the student affairs department refuses to even try to understand and hear my perspective. Recovery is already hard enough even with all of the support I have right now. I feel hurt and betrayed as a student and a member of CMU, because I am not getting ANY care from them at all, all they do is send harsh and cruel letters to me when I am struggling the most, and it makes me feel threatened that they plan on putting my enrollment in jeopardy if I don't follow their protocols and terms, which are not mutually discussed before they send the official mandate to me. I am also worried that CMU will continue to release my medical information without my consent or even informing me first since they have exhibited that pattern of behavior before when I was in the hospital. I am concerned for my safety because if my medical information is not being safely handled, a lot of people can get access to it, and I do not want to deal with that. ",

I want more social support from my classmates.",

Not trying to be a dick here, but HIPAA is very specific about who is actually bound and when.  \n\nAnd I really hope you get the help you need.  It may not be what you want to hear but, to me, it sounds like you may need to focus on your mental health and not worry about school for the time being.  Maybe a semester or two off might not be a terrible idea?\n\nBest of luck to you OP.",

A lawyer does not need to only sue another party - they can simply advise you on your rights under the law and ways to move forward.\n\nIn any conflict situation (what this is) you need to identify what power you have to affect the change you want. You don't appear to have any power in the university at all, aside from your power of the purse, but they're considering removing you as a student anyway so this is unlikely to work. I also am not sure what change you want to affect - so please sit down with yourself, a lawyer, or a trusted friend and come up with concrete, actionable items you want to happen. An apology from CMU? A financial settlement? An agreement to not remove you from the university? I can't answer that. Only you can.\n\nThe most power that you MIGHT have in this situation is through local, state, and federal laws. A lawyer who is sympathetic can help you understand what power you have and what power you don't have in whatever your situation is.\n\nAlso understand that sometimes in life we can find ourselves in situations that are unwinnable, even if we play perfectly. I find that being able to identify what levers I have access to helps me grab a little bit of the power back from the void.\n\nManage your expectations if you decide to go the legal route. Lawyers are human, and some of them can be very tunnel visioned. Some will only want to take on cases where there is the promise of monetary damages, because that's how they make a living. That's fine, but might not be what you're after. Consider the fallout from this approach as well.",

There were apparently going to be a bunch of hearings and panels about what could be done.\n\nLooks like absolutely nothing has changed since then, which does not even remotely surprise me.  To an extent this is true of all colleges, but CMU seems to be one of the worst in its administration being detached from the realities of the student experience, which I think is reflected in the school's endowment.\n\nFor as much as this school charges, its students have a right to ask for more, or at least be treated with basic decency.",

The school is usually lenient with leave of absence and return to school policies.  And if not, well clearly this is not the place best for your happiness and well being.\n\nIn my time away I found most of my stress and unhappiness had nothing to do with the school perse but the culture perpetuated by us students always looking to be better, achieve more and be the best.  I felt if I was not top of my class I was worthless.  And the level of talent I was \u201ccompeting\u201d against was nothing like what I saw in high school.  Being able to understand all of my issues better allowed me to return to school 4 years after taking a leave and graduating happy and healthy.\n\nTake the time to reflect inward and take care of yourself.  That\u2019s the most important thing you can do for success and happiness not only now but also in the future.  Best of luck OP",

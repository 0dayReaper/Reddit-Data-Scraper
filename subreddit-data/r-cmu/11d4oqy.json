    "postText": "I was accepted into the MSR program and was wondering if anyone knows how easy it is to get a TAship in case I can't get funded for RAship after the first semester? Can TAship possibly cover the whole tuition fee?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI heard RAship depends solely on whether the professor gets funding or not, and most professors in HRI, which is the field I am interested in, do not have much funding since they have fewer projects related to the military.",

Many of the incoming students I knew didn\u2019t even find a project they liked until halfway through the first semester.",

The exception is PhDs because it is a graduation requirement that they TA. \n\nAs a master\u2019s student, you have a limited set of classes that you have taken and auto-qualify for. So you need to find some other course where you are knowledgeable enough to teach. Though this is possible, since I have TAd with other master\u2019s students who haven\u2019t taken the course before.\n\nAlso keep in mind that you need approval from your research advisor to TA (informal, nothing official). And they will want you to dedicate as much time as possible to research.",

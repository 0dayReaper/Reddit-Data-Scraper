                    "comment": "but otherwise, i personally was never the one for initiate talking about my major for anything, other people had to ask it out of me first, and as soon as I got a STEM double major I always made sure to mention that as well. given the comments, sounds like it was more a me thing, but i did mention my major to one person and they went 'ugh' immediately but i think it was because they were super anti capitalist kind of person. I know some people who say stuff like 'oh tepper is super easy' but they were the type of academically intense yet laissez faire kind of people. I heard more of that in my first few years more than anything that was affirming (and other quantitative confirmations of course difficulty). \n\nI will add tho, while it seems like what makes a cs kid successful is how well they're doing in their classes, I think what makes a tepper kid successful/should be what makes them successful is getting pretty involved in extracurriculars, like pushing to do meaningful work on a club (basically all clubs have you do stock pitches/consulting-esque work) or having club leadership responsibilities (officially or unofficially). A handful of people are apart of sport teams, or work w/ career center to mentor other students. Lots of these additional opportunities that build up soft skills. Or they take more intensive business classes (more of a junior/senior thing though), like one where you have to apply to take an MBA class and do consulting work for an actual client. I believe that one is takes a bit of elbow grease.\n\nit's also bc people critique basic tepper classes for not really helping with the real world, bc taking a few basic cs/engineering classes can get you somewhere, whereas taking a few basic tepper courses aren't going to be the reason that pushes you as far if at all (if you just take the classes and dont do much more. you gotta pair the classes with real-ish world experiences to put the theory into practice, hence all of the professional-esque business clubs out there. there's more to this whole thing but that's a convo for another time). \n\nall in all, long ramble aside, this is just to say I feel like there is a bit of a difference for the above reasons, but that will only come from a few people, and honestly you wouldn't want to pay too much credence to those opinion anyways, since in my experience, they came from those who were too buried in grades and technical details. as someone else mentioned, your work ethic and drive are far more important in college and in the real world for anywhere you go.",

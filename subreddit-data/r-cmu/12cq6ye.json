    "postText": "I'm an incoming PhD student at CMU and I was looking to get an apartment at Amberson Gardens. I was wondering what people think about it. For $1030 a month with all utilities included it sounds good. It's also really close to campus which I like. \n\nIf anyone has any other suggestions lmk!",

            "comment": "Lived there 10 years ago and even back then it was worn down. Walls are paper thin, the dryers never seemed to work, outlets were 2-prong, depending on which side of the building you live on, and the headlights from trains will light up your entire apartment or wake you up from noise. The property manager's son who has access to the master key has been known to go into people's apartments and steal things. The parking garage is literally falling apart. The elevators are frequently out of order. But it's cheap?\n\nLol I can only recommend if you are a broke undergrad with a low standard of living.",

They recently put in new washers and dryers so that pretty good, I haven\u2019t had any issues with the property management yet but I\u2019ve only been there for about 8 months now. The noise is definitely a problem especially on the side facing UPMC Shadyside but with a fan/ac running and earplugs I\u2019ve been able to get by. I definitely agree about only living there because it is cheap. If you can afford a better spot with a little more space I highly recommend you look for it.",

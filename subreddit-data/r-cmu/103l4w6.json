            "comment": "RA here, switching into a single (especially this close to the beginning of the semester) is unfortunately unlikely. You may have some success trying to move to a different room with different roommates. I'd recommend reaching out to your RA and emailing rmassign@andrew.cmu.edu as soon as possible to see what they can do. Be aware that for the first two weeks of the semester there is a freeze on all room changes. Best of luck.\n\nCheck here as well, this page gives an overview of what the room change process looks like: https://www.cmu.edu/housing/resident-services/assignments.html",

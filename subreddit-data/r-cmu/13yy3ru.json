Also, it provides me with a connection to math, a subject I'm not very good at. Coding helps me learn math in a new way. Oh yes, also it helps with reading because you need to go through lots of documentations to become a better coder. And yep, money is a nice bonus!",

I do enjoy coding, I find it awesome that we can create websites and applications and make computers do what we want through lines of code, I find the math behind it intriguing, and the fact that technology is changing society's behaviour and our future is also extremely amazing.\n\nNot sure whether taking classes and tests about it over the next 4 years wld diminish or grow my interest in coding...\n\nAnyway I think theres probably ppl in CS for different reasons, theres vv likely many ppl in it js for the high pay, and we can't exactly fault that.",

The people who \"go far\" tend to enjoy something about it; if you do this all day, you need to leave at the end of the day not feeling awful, or you're not going to grow, and if you don't keep growing, you've got a pretty hard cap.\n\n(Admittedly, that cap is currently well paid, so there's that.)\n\nAnyways, when I started in industry, I think my first job was $16/hour, hourly.  If you find the older folks, we didn't do this for them money, because prior to 1995 or so, this wasn't a heavily moneyed profession.\n\nThat said, I wouldn't ever code after work, because I get enough tech at my day job, but yeah, I like building stuff.  After one of the earlier industry recessions, I went and taught woodworking for awhile.  Building stuff is cool.\n\nThese days, I also like helping others build stuff, and occasionally still get to write some code myself, which is still fun.  \n\nFind something you like about it and try and make that part of your job; focus where you're strong.  It's still gonna feel like \\*work\\*, and that's why you get paid for it, but you need to like something about it, or you cap out more quickly.",

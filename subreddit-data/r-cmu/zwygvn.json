    "postText": "TED designed 11 lessons about skills and techniques to help people develop their own talk. I watched the free trial lesson and found it\u2019s helpful. I\u2019m interested in learning the rest of the lessons. I thought it would be helpful to learn these lessons within a small group (3 or 4 people). So that we could do the small group discussions and share learning feedbacks with each other. Here is the link to the lessons: https://masterclass.ted.com/\n\nAnyone interested in joining the group? \n\nTED charge a total of $49.99 fee for the lessons. We could discuss about the cost sharing too if you are interested.",

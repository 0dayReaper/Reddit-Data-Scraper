If you have no experience, you'll either take 15-110 or 15-112. \n\nSide note: you graduated from college before I was born.",

Either way, your entire grade for the class was determined by a single final called the Mastery Exam. Class was taught in C++. The exam was 4 programming problem levels: D, C, B, A in order of increasing difficulty. Each level had 3 problem choices you picked one to implement. I think the time limit was 4 hours?\n\nIt was not fun. You could totally prepare theoretically as they released most of problems well before the exam. So if you wanted to spend the time, you could just solve every problem beforehand. I knew of one insane person who actually decided memorizing every solution was easier than just learning to code, but hey, you know how CMU can be. However they also added new problems every year to the levels so rote memorization was kind of risky.\n\nI called it hazing for a reason.\n\nQuestion: what language are they teaching the intro classes in now?",

If you only got D working - it was a D, If you only got C working, but not D, it was a D and etc.\n\nIf you went to class, did the labs and homework and used TA time in the Wean clusters the test was just nerve racking, not necessarily hard.\n\nI believe it was explicitly the first of two weed-out classes though. (15-211 being the other one) My guess is CMU stopped being so punitive once it got so expensive - Tuition in 1997 was $20,150 after all.",

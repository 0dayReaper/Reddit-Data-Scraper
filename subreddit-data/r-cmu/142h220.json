    "postText": "Yes, I may be crazy, but I\u2019m legitimately interested in all 3. \nGot admitted as a transfer to MechE, am planning to double major with robotics. Im a sophomore but almost junior-level in courses due to coming in with a years worth of AP credit. \nI\u2019m very interested in the full spectrum that robotics has to offer, from the mechanical side to more of the AI/ML part of it. I was planning to focus on the more AI/ML sided course load in the robotics major, which overlaps heavily with the AI additional major. \nWould I be crazy to tack on a few extra courses and do a triple major in MechE/Robotics/AI? Is it possible, in theory?",

But I'll say this honestly: if i could go back, I'd drop one of the majors and take a fuckton more electives. That was the main downside, i couldn't study abroad and I only had a couple electives that were completely outside my majors. Happy to elaborate if it'd help!",

And then my thesis was a history thesis, but using some of the techniques I learned in the others. I did not end up going to grad school, but I can definitely say that all three of those majors made me more employable and better at my job(s). I focused on creative nonfiction writing at CMU and ended up as a journalist and comms person, I've published pieces in big international publications and had stories that went super viral, and the education I got absolutely helped that happen. But so did the internships I did, and if I had gotten to take more electives I would have been exposed to more of the tech that I'm now trying to teach myself. It's all a balance! If i could do it again, I'd try to do one of those \"make your own\" majors, at least to combine two of them. That'd give you a little more breathing room and space for electives. But yeah, talk to your advisor, it depends on your situation but I came in with a bunch of AP/IB credit and I believe I only had to take one summer school class to graduate in four years like normal. It's definitely doable. Just the question of whether it's worth what you give up.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in my third/fourth year of a very similar one (Mech E, CS, and Robotics) and it is possible but very difficult. As was mentioned you should not expect to graduate on time (I\u2019m doing 5 years and some summers though it admittedly could have been done without them). \n\nOn the side of logistics, AP credit will not take you that far. MechE only really takes Physics and Gen Ed\u2019s and CS only really 112 and calculus, though I don\u2019t know what kind of transfer credit you have so results will vary. As you probably know the Robotics major would have maybe 2-3 courses of overlap, with the AI and perception requirements plus maybe an elective. AI has the same probability req so as CS you would have to apply for MechE requirement substitution (admittedly pretty easy). You can also get several robotics courses to count for CIT gen Eds, and there is overlap between MechE and Robotics in the last semester. That being said the lower double counting cap for AI (2) will make things much more difficult. \n\nIf you have access to Stellic that would be the best way to find out. It is probably possible in theory but I would highly recommend leaving slack as things often do not go to plan (especially since many of these workloads will be objectively evil). There are better options if you want to optimize for your qualifications or resume so a triple major is only really the best option if you have coursework you actively want to take and the major is a means to get formal credit for undergoing it. That being said, when I first started I saw a similar comment which I can now confirm to be true. It was something like \u201cwe can try to warn you and provide evidence of its difficulty, but odds are if you really want to do it then we will not be able to stop you\u201d.",

If you\u2019re more interested in AI/ML, I would just drop the Robotics major and do a focus on robotics classes in the AI degree. Most programs have double counting rules so even if there is overlap between two, it\u2019s not always helpful. It\u2019s always better to give yourself some breathing room, and considering you haven\u2019t yet started at CMU, first experience the workload and then make a decision about this stuff. Most technical classes here are 1.5x the work of another school\u2019s equivalent.",

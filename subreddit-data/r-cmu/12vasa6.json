            "comment": "The halal on-campus restaurants are explicitly listed at [0]. There's more options within a short walk / free bus ride to Oakland (61ABCD). Depending on how strict you are (e.g., whether you only eat food that has been explicitly certified halal), there are also a decent number of vegetarian and vegan people at CMU, and it's easy to find options without pork or alcohol. I wouldn't describe the number of halal places as \"a lot\", but you should always have a few options nearby.\n\nThere is a general prayer room [1] in the university center.\n\nYou will generally need to go out of your way to find other Muslim people, I think. I didn't realize someone was Muslim for at least a year until he said that he was fasting one day. You can join MSA as suggested by another commenter.\n\n[0] https://apps.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/dining/conceptinfo/?page=listConcepts  \n[1] https://www.cmu.edu/cohon-university-center/center-facilities/prayer-room/index.html",

Their halal meat are cheaper than the non-halal ones at Giant Eagle. The Libyan family that has run this shop for decades are friendly if you get to know them. This shop, however, is off the bus route so it's a bit of a walk up/downhill from Pitts's library.",

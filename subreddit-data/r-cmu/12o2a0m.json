I've tried looking online but all I can find is that you don't need to take the placement exam if you've taken the CSA exam regardless of score, no word about taking the placement test if you didn't get a 5.",

Just tell your advisor that you feel the score you got isn\u2019t representative of your ability anymore. \n\nIt\u2019s 20 questions, in Java. You need 18 correct. I took the exam on Canvas. Good luck!",

The questions are in Java, but they're logical enough that you can understand it without knowing Java super well. I took it with no Java experience and only a little Python experience and got a 15/20. That wasn't enough to test me out of 112, but that wasn't my goal anyway since I wanted to take 112 but they just made everyone take the placement test regardless.",

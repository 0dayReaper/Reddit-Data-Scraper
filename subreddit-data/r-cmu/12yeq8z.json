    "postText": "Hi everyone  \n\n\nI am an incoming international exchange student for the Fall 2023 semester and was looking for housing options, and wanted to know what would be the best options?  \n\n\nSomethings that i am looking out for are,\n\n1. Private Bathroom(Sharing my bathroom is just a big NO for me :))\n2. Amenities(like AC, wifi speeds, sanitary conditions etc)\n3. Community(i like it quiet or sort of )  \n\n\nOr if someone can suggest me some off-campus housing that is a better bang for the buck would really appreciate it :). I searched on the CMU recommended ones and all seem too far or are too expensive for my taste.  \n\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",

You could try property agencies like Mozart/walnut etc, but they\u2019ll probably the same price as the one\u2019s you see on the website. There are past threads on the areas in Pittsburgh for students on r/cmu, r/pitt, and r/pittsburgh so you can gauge how much to fork out for a room that fits your needs (like: https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/w3okuy/how_much_rent_are_you_paying_and_which_area_of/).\n\nI think if budget is a concern, the best bet is to find housing directly once you are there (i.e. heading to CMU 1-2 weeks earlier and going around the area, looking for landlords directly)\n\nAlso, I see that you\u2019re an exchange student, so you could try looking on FB marketplace/ CMU Housing for a Fall sublet that may be cheaper than renting directly.",

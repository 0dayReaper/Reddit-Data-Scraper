    "postText": "Hey folks,\n\nI'm currently a football player at a service academy and I'm hoping to transfer to CMU this fall. I'm curious about how it is managing school and social life as a student-athlete. I don\u2019t enjoy football at the D1 level because I feel like I am always behind in my academics, and I\u2019m hoping it won\u2019t be that way at CMU. I applied to the IS major at CMU, which I've heard is flexible, and I'm hoping to have more time to focus on my studies and social life if I end up playing football.\n\nI'm also wondering about the social aspect of being a student-athlete at CMU. What is it like to make friends while being an athlete? Are there any particular groups or communities that are especially welcoming to student-athletes?\n\nI'm also curious about how housing works at CMU. What are the options for housing as a student-athlete, and what is the process like for selecting and securing housing? Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

            "comment": "Students athletes mesh pretty well with the rest of the student body as nobody is really looking to go pro from CMU. From my friends on the football and soccer teams, they value academics at least the same as their sport, if not much more. As for social life, it's probably better than the average CMU non-student athlete, but it's not particularly anything to go crazy about",

            "comment": "Graduate mechE, ex-football here, played the last 4 years here and got my undergrad here in MechE\n\nOverall I think it\u2019s a pretty good balance between athletics and academics. One of the biggest upside is that a majority of your teammates would most likely have the same major so you are not alone. I don't think social life would be a problem if you are willing to be social and actually talk to the teammates. Even as an ex-player I was able to become friends with a graduate USC transfer kicker simply because he was in one of my grad classes (i never played with him in my undergrad and he just transferred last fall). Roughly 90-95% of the players are in the same frat, myself included, so we hang out a lot outside of football. I think it\u2019s a great brotherhood. Overall I don\u2019t think there are any particular groups or communities that are especially welcoming to student-athletes but having the title is definitely a perk. Professors would be more lenient as long as you communicate with them. Academic here is a priority for almost all athletes. Everyone chose to go here for the degree and the potential jobs, not the fact that we did amazing this season. Other sports performed just as well but like us we prioritize our academics. \n\nI cannot speak for others but I had no problems making friends while being an athlete. I have friends from all aspect from studies to staff (including people who work in food) and even other athletes on different teams. You can do whatever you want even if you\u2019re a student-athlete. I joined various clubs and ran one of my own as the president. Your experience really depends on what you make of it. \n\nSo the way housing works is you apply/select the campus housing you want to get into. Otherwise you would rent off campus. You have a pretty good chance getting into your first few choices. I don\u2019t think I heard anyone getting rejected from their first or second choice. All freshmen student-athletes get put into the dorms and then they usually move out into off campus housing the second year. There are some who decide to stay in university housing.\n\nI can tell you more if you would like to PM me.",

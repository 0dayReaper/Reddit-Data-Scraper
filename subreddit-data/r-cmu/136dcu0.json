    "postText": "I am incomming ECE MS student in Fall 2023 and the advising team allow me to take 18-613 in summer. However from what I saw my previous course in UCI (ICS53) using same material from CMU and cover lots of topic in this course (we spend major time from ch9 to 12 but only two weeks were dedicated to C) so it doesn't seems to be that neccesary for me to take it and I need more time doing intern in summer.\n\nI major CS in my undergraduate study and mostly spend time on information (data base, search system and stuff) with intelligent system (AI, data mining) so would likely to continue on this way, is it still recommended to take this course? I might consider taking one or two course relate to EE or system but might not be that interesting in it tho.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am a graduating senior at another school. I am planning to work for a few years before deciding to go back for an MS in statistics. However, one program that caught my eye was the MS ML program at CMU. I had a few questions for anyone who has been in the program, or knows of the general requirements that it takes to get in. Are most of the students in the cohort who get accepted people who have done research in ML before? Is that an expectation? Furthermore, does the CMU ML program have any financial aid? I\u2019d like to get some insight into the level of students this program admits to see how competitive I would need to be 2-3 years from now.",

            "comment": "MSML specifically actually does give you (partial usually) tuition waivers with RA work, though it depends on whether your advisor has funding. Read the MSML handbook online, it mentions how aid works. MSML, MLT, MSR all have the potential for funding and are also some of the harder programs to get into. I know nothing about any of the other programs though. Look up Linkedin profiles for the folk who got in (their names are on the MLD department website) to get an idea of who gets in.\n\nMSML specifically has a bias towards students with really good grades and test scores, mathy backgrounds are an advantage, and having publications in strong venues is an advantage though it\u2019s not technically a requirement. Compared to other programs, MSML tends to care less about post-graduation industry work experience and the cohort has a decent number of folk right out of their undergrad.",

What happens if there\u2019s a bad recession when you graduate and you can\u2019t get a good paying job for several years? It happened to me after I was told by my undergrad program at a private uni that the average grad made 80k. The great recession happened while I was in school and I didn\u2019t make 80k until 8 years after graduation. Those 8 years were a struggle because of those enormous debt payments I had to make on a lower than expected salary. I\u2019m only doing a masters at CMU now because my job is paying for it.",

Only then you will be out an extra year of tuition and missing an extra year of experience compared to somebody who went directly into industry from undergrad.\r  \n\r  \nIn academia, you get a master's during your PhD for free. The only reason to get a masters in addition to a PhD is if your undergraduate GPA was too low to apply directly to PhD programs. Industry dgaf about GPA unless it was insanely low.\r  \n\r  \nIDK how it is for other industries besides CS, but for CS there's really no point in getting a master's unless you need a better GPA for a PhD program or to extend a student visa.",

A lot of CS can be done without even going to college, but data science  (and especially data engineering) roles usually require some level of theoretical knowledge expected of graduate students because the roles are a little closer to R&amp;D I think. If you're just doing straight data analytics though, most of those roles are closer to CS software dev roles where you don't need as much graduate-level education.\n\nBut echoing other sentiments, while the masters program for ML at CMU is still pretty good (especially if you \\*weren't\\* an undergrad in AI/ML at CMU), the PhD might still be more worth if you want to get more lucrative data science roles.",

    "postText": "I am an entering first-year student admitted to Mellon School of Science for Biology, but I am looking to switch into Tepper School of Business while perhaps pursing a CS double major or minor. Is the switch into Tepper doable (I know that the CS major/minor will be quite challenging to complete, and I am completely okay with letting my CS aspirations die)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am likely commiting to CMU, but I just want to be sure that I have the flexibility to transfer into Tepper with relative ease.",

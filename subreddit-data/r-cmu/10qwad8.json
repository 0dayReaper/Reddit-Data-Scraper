    "postText": "Hey guys, I got into CMU ED2 and will be attending next fall, any tips on how to have the most fun at CMU? I know it\u2019s a hard school, but I\u2019d also like to get out and have fun as much as possible. I was thinking about maybe joining a frat, but I don\u2019t really consider myself as a \u201cfrat bro\u201d stereotype, any thoughts on the frats at CMU? Is the party scene decent if you\u2019re not in a frat? Any fun things to definitely check out in Pittsburgh? In addition, do you feel like the average student enjoys getting out of their room and doing things? I\u2019ve heard a few negative stereotypes over the internet but now sure how true those are.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Party scene is kinda dead if you're not in a frat. It'll be a lot of small parties between friends. Frats IMO are really not that bad. Many of them are decently academically oriented and a lot of the people in the frats are quite focused on school. \n\nA tip for having fun at CMU is ironically working on the weekend. Personally, I study and do homework for about 2 hours on Satuday and 6 hours on Sunday so I'm relatively relaxed on the weekdays. I still do about 5 hours of hw per day on the weekdays, but I haven't had a panicking about the deadline moment yet.\n\nAs with any school, it's a mixed bag of personalities, but as true with the stereotype, CMU does tend to have a more introverted/nerdier population",

There's less drugs and alcohol but you can still find it. \nI enjoy the great museums (and free admission to most), great parks next to campus (disc golf, hiking, biking), tons of restaurants within walking distance and even more a short bus ride away, bars/clubs if you're interested, frat/sorority parties if you're interested, amazing bike trails all over the city, really great theater (both on campus with the T5 drama school, but also multiple theaters downtown (short bus ride)), 4 pro sports teams, lots of festivals, fun art crawls. There's no beach or mountains but otherwise I think you can find whatever you like to do.\nTake off at least one day each weekend to explore.",

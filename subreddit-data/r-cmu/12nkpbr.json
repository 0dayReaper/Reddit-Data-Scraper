The heat in question starts at 3:53:25 or so. I am not sure, but my guess is that the violation is around 3:53:54, it looks like their buggy (the nearer one) first goes near the far side of their lane, then after passing that support structure crosses the near side line (my guess is this second one is the violation).",

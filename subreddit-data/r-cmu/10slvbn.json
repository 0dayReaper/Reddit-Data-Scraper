    "postText": " Hi! I'm looking for a spring/summer sublease (now-August 20th) on 151 Craig Street (Schenley House), around a 10-minute walk to campus. It's a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom house with a Pitt female student. The rent is 600 not including electricity and internet (around 50/month). It has all the necessary utilities and a twin-sized mattress.\n\nThe other roommate does have cats, so if you are allergic, it might not be the best option (we don't want you to die).\n\nPlease dm if interested!",

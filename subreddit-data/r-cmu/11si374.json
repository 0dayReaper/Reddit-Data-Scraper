            "comment": "If it's still taught by Roger Dannenberg - this class sucks. Stay far away.\n\nIt's highly technical for both music and programming. I have a strong music background and a novice background in programming, took it with many friends with strong programming backgrounds and casual music backgrounds. Everyone struggled - me because the programming was tough, and the \"music\" is more like physics of sound so if you're not versed in that like my friends it's basically impossible to comprehend.\n\nThe assignments are very time intensive, like 12 hours a week. Think a 5-10 coding problem set each week and then a pretty large term project.\n\nThe kicker - the lectures don't actually pertain to the assignments at all. They are more about technical programming and Dannenbergs background. To do the assignments you are supposed to read the documentation he provides.\n\nThe subject matter is really interesting, the guy literally invented Audacity so it should be an awesome class, but it's not really set up to teach you anything.\n\nCannot unrecommend highly enough.",

Though if you're taking this because you like playing music and think you'll make cool stuff, probably stay away lol. The coding language (Nyquist) is kinda funky and the stuff you end up making sounds kinda weird.\n\n* Highly recommend this class as a chill domains elective for scs.\n* Don't highly recommend this class if you \\~ love music &lt;3 \\~ lma, it's not that fun.",

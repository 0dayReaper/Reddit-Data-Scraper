    "postText": "I am joining CMU this fall. I needed some help in deciding where to open my bank account. I heard digital banks like Zolve are better than traditional banks but how do I decide among available digital banks like Zolve, Sable etc. There isn't much on the internet. Generally Reddit search could solve this but with the ongoing protest, I can't get much clarity.",

The other benefit is you don\u2019t need a SSN to open the account. Check out zolve.com",

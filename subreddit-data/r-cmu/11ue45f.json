    "postText": "I'm a recently admitted student to the MS in ECE program. I wanted to see if any current/past students could help me answer a few questions.\n\n1. Does the project option result in an M.S. thesis? Or is it just a project with an informal write-up.\n2. Are there a good amount of faculty working in AI? That's the concentration I am planning to do so I'd like to do my project with a professor in that field too.\n3. Are there any disadvantages to doing the ECE program with an ML/AI focus in comparison to a traditional MS CS program? It looks like the ECE department has a lot of AI related courses, but I'm concerned that an ECE degree might seem confusing to employers when I'm applying for AI research positions in a couple years. \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I have the same questions too as I also want to pursue the AI/ML concentration under ECE (admitted to MS in ECE for Fall 2023). Based on my understanding, I think most ECE faculty working on AI/ML does research related to neuro engineering or other advanced signal processing\u2026? Following this post and thanks!",

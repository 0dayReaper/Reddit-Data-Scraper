    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI have gotten admits from CMU MIIS and UIUC MSCS (Thesis option). My background is in NLP and I have done research for the past two years and want to continue doing that. I am getting an RA position at UIUC therefore I will be fully funded. However, I think that CMU has a better NLP culture than UIUC but I wont have the time to actually do research because of the hectic coursework of MIIS.\n\nWhat do you recommend?",

            "comment": "Firstly, from a point of view where money isn't an issue, I would find it really hard to argue why you'd choose CMU over UIUC. If it was MSCS at CMU, that would be a different story, but MSCS at UIUC would definitely be considered in the same tier as CS-based programs at CMU (again, not MSCS). MIIS has more LTI, i.e. NLP, requirements, which you could take up in an MSCS as well. Overall I would consider UIUC MSCS to be at least as good of an option, because of the fact that an MSCS is a more standard, flexible degree. UIUC is typically considered to be in the top5 CS unis, and tbh it doesn't have any major impact on jobs, as long as you are in top10-20 unis and are active in networking etc.\n\nIf you include the finances, it's a no-brainer. Getting a fully funded MS from a top uni in CS is a golden ticket. CMU is exorbitant and has limited support, and job outcomes and prestige for both are comparable.\n\nTLDR; if it was MSCS CMU, then maybe there's a case. But I don't see why you would turn down fully funded UIUC MSCS for this.",

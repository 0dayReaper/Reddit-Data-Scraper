    "postText": "I got into cmu for neuroscience, since I want to study the brain. However, I was interested in swapping into the school of engineering, since the biomedical engineering major has a track called neuroengineering that I'd rather do than just a straight neuroscience degree. How easy is it to swap into the school of engineering?",

Could always take some of the courses while sticking with neuroscience possibly\n\nOr if you\u2019re set on engineering, it shouldn\u2019t be that tricky to transfer over, as long as there\u2019s room for you in your desired major",

            "comment": "i wanna chime in on the stuff i know \n- cs course rigour, i actually found the first few (112 especially, but 122 also) quite easy; it gets worse. not unmanageable, but worse \n- i never really had much problems with the food, there\u2019s places on campus that are decent, if not exactly healthy. but i only got half of the freshman year on campus (covid), so it\u2019d probably get far more tiring if you stay there longer \n- rez on fifth is the best residence (tbh i can\u2019t exactly compare, but they do have in-unit kitchens and bathrooms, so would recommend) \n- if you want to party, befriend some frat guys, and there\u2019s stuff going on. i\u2019ve never gone though, so can\u2019t confirm \n- didn\u2019t try to get an internship freshman year, but got it very easily sophomore year (only two applications, one accepted), so i\u2019d imagine it\u2019s not too bad\n- job offers are great",

            "comment": "1. As mentioned, Tartan Scholars is a GREAT resource if you\u2019re invited (opportunity to move in early to meet other Tartan Scholars, extra academic support in your first/second year classes, invites to fun events, opportunity to be hired to plan said events or offer said extra support once you\u2019re an upperclassmen, TS lounge, etc). If you\u2019re not invited in (occasionally that happens), join First Together and/or your relevant cultural club (if applicable) to join the larger community (lots of intermingling across TS, Spirit, SALSA, etc)\n2. Honestly, I have found it very manageable. Definitely use your resources early and often (office hours, supplemental instruction which is like a guided study group for certain classes, review sessions) and get comfortable asking for help if you are not already. If you\u2019re not confident in your coding, retaking 112 can be a good idea even if you have the credit already\n3. Controversial opinion but I actually like it (and voluntarily eat it even as an upperclassman). The Exchange is the best place but there\u2019s good variety. You\u2019ll learn what you like pretty quickly although there\u2019s not as many healthy options as many would like\n4. I would recommend choosing traditional style for your first year (donner, Stever, etc) because those tend to be more social. You\u2019ll enjoy apartment style and suite style more as an upperclassman once you have a defined friend group \n5. There is but you have to know the right people to know what\u2019s happening. Greek Life is the easiest path to this, but befriending Greek people is almost as good\n6. Assuming you\u2019re SCS, about half get internships their first year, but I really wouldn\u2019t stress about it. It is a million times easier to get something your second year even if you didn\u2019t do anything your first year. That first summer is also a great opportunity to try research if that interests you, which is MUCH easier to get than an internship that year and is a pretty worthwhile experience in itself\n7. Excellent (see here: https://www.cmu.edu/career/outcomes/post-grad-dashboard.html). You can also find internship destinations there",

So if you have any experience with that you'll do fine, but if you don't you're just like most people and itl be pretty tough to adjust to freshman fall but you'll get the hang of it. The programming courses are fine.",

It's a little strange.\nI'ld say food is above average for colleges but haven't eaten at that many. There's lots of variety. There are also lots of restaurants within 5-10 min walk.",

            "comment": "What college you do BSCF through depends on what your current declared major is. If you're in MCS, you would be a BSCF major through MCS. Same thing with Tepper. The only difference between the two is the gen ed requirements.\n\nIf you're currently in another school (like Dietrich), I think you would have to pick between MCS and Tepper for the major, and again the only difference would be the Gen Eds you'd have to take. If you're currently an Econ major and not in Tepper, see if you can switch to being in Tepper because that would likely make your life a little easier",

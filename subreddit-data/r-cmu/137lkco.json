I think it does definitely depend to an extent on the people who live on your floor, but the small number of people (at least for my floor) led to a nice sense of community, most of my friends (especially in the first semester) were from my floor and we hung out in the floor lounge a lot. I think there might have been floors that were less social tho, like maybe 2 or 3 out of the 6 were quieter? I'm not totally sure. The AC is really nice for sure, as is having a bathroom that you only share with 3-4 other people.",

How difficult would it be to do well in the rest of the labs and the final exam, to make up for the loss of points? I was going through some personal issues and couldn't start working on the lab early and now I think I might not be able to finish it by the deadline.",

I got really really shit scores on cache and bomb lab and was going through a slump myself but I\u2019m in the process of turning it around. Also dm the course staff, they\u2019re super accommodating",

The labs after are not as challenging but some say proxy is as hard or harder than malloc. The historical average on the final at least for the 18s is around 75.",

I\u2019ve headed that cmu students get free public bus rides",

(Did an English group project on this)\n\nFor the public bus system the best options are Google maps and Transit, both of which you can tell where you are and where you are going and it tells you how you can use public buses to get there, though Transit does so with the live data of bus locations (and is very helpful if you ever want to know when a bus is coming).\n\nFor the CMU shuttle and escort there isn\u2019t a similar app for how to get from here to here, though there is a Ride Systems app (with horrible UI) and a website [andysbuses.com/routes](https://www.andysbuses.com/routes) which shows routes and live locations. And what the shuttle and escort service also has is a document made by a couple of students for an English project which explains how to use them and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lriXF20XVUtU9D4sKduo8FAOJTFvHG6F/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=106245419628246791309&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true).",

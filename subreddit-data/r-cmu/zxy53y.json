They said two things on day one that stuck with me:\n\n* If you graduate, you get to represent SCS and CMU - independently of your grade.\n* If you need to pick between getting a B with good sleep and an A with only a few hours of sleep, always go with the \"B with good sleep\" option.\n\nWhen I interview candidates I don't ask for grades. I ask them questions to see if they can be good at the job they are interviewing for. So for me, I'd say focus on learning and not the particular grades.",

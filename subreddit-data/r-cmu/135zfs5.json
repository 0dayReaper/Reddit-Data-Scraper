Recently I've had multiple severe mental health problems that have made it difficult to function as a human let alone complete my classwork successfully. I have a meeting with my advisor coming up and I'm terrified that I'll basically be told I dug my own grave by waiting this long to seek help and there won't be any way to recover. Does anyone have experience with a situation like this or suggestions on how I can avoid getting expelled? Or is it hopeless?",

The tl;dr is that if you have a semester QPA below 2.0 you'll be placed on academic probation. This doesn't have immediate consequences, but you may have to take a leave of absence if your semester QPA doesn't improve.\n\nDon't blame yourself -- it is never too late to ask for help and the most important thing is that you are doing ok and taking steps to recover and feel better. Your advisor can help you figure out what the most reasonable path is forward, whether it's helping get you connected to mental health resources, taking a lighter semester next fall, or taking a semester off to recover and focus on your health.",

They'll be able to tell you how big of an impact this semester will have in the long run in addition to helping you flesh out some concrete next steps. If you feel like your mental health issues are long-term issues then it would definitely be worthwhile to go to CAPS or to go schedule an appointment with a therapist near campus. I wish you luck in finding a way to resolve to your mental health problems, and my DMs are open if you ever just need to somebody to vent at .",

I didn\u2019t complete any of my programming assignments past the second assignment and it finally hit me when I did horribly on both the midterms that I was about to fail. I don\u2019t know if Mark Stehlik\u2019s your advisor but he\u2019s amazing. He helped me drop out of the class by stating it as a family emergency (It kind of was but it was more mental health issues due to family). I just had to fill out a form. Let me know if you have any questions. You\u2019re gonna do fine! There\u2019s always a solution to this.\n\nAfter dropping out that summer I proceeded to get an A in the class the following semester. I\u2019m rooting for you!",

And here is the thing, it got through the end of the semester by working with my advisor. I dropped a few class far past the drop deadline and I failed one class and barely passed my other two. It really freakin sucked. But the worst thing that happened is I was put on academic probation, (it\u2019s not that big a deal)\n\nNow here is some advice I wish I had. Take a step back. Look at your support systems, your friends, family, mental health practitioners. Who are the people and things you need to get well? Are they close to Pittsburgh? And then look at if you HAVE to graduate on your expected date for any reason. \n\nIf and when (and even if not) your advisor brings taking a leave of absence, please do consider it. I know it\u2019s scary, and I know there is a lot of pressure around not dropping out, but A leave of absence is not dropping out. You can re-enroll with no hassle for two years after your take one. The most important thing right now is that you are able to get well and if cmu isn\u2019t the place to support that, come back when your ready.",

I didn\u2019t officially take a leave, I just dropped out - I had transferred to Pitt from another school and had been dealing with depression there too and doing poorly so I just accepted I was a failure at life. \n\nI took a couple years off and when I had better mental health, a better job, and a living situation that was supportive, I went back to school part time and finished my bachelors degree. I got straight A\u2019s for the remaining 2 years, only took 2-3 courses a semester, and then did great in grad school with similar limits on my course schedule. Not to say everyone needs that, but for me - a part time course load made the difference.\n\nA leave of absence can sometimes be the best thing you do while you stabilize and check in with yourself and your care.",

If possible I recommend taking a break from studies to be able to reset. Definitely recommend talking with a trained professional of some sort as well.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any information about grad school, but as an undergraduate if you have been been performing relatively okay (with two semesters on the deans list) it\u2019s highly unlikely you will be expelled. There\u2019s a whole procedure regarding probation and suspension and unless you have been suspended before the most likely action is to be put on probation. I suspect the policy for graduate students is similar but the gpa thresholds are a bit higher.\n\nNo matter what the outcome is I\u2019m sure things will turn out okay. Just do what is necessary to take care of your mental health before anything else. Cheers and best of luck!",

There's a whole department on campus whose whole job is to support and have the back of students with disabiltiies-- and mental health is a disability!

Hugely recommend you reach out, for advice if nothing else. Good luck! Happy to advice more if it helps. &lt;3",

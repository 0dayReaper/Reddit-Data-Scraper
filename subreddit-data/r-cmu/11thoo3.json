So it's very hypocritical for him to make appeals to the ideal of free speech. It's also similarly bad mannered to make those appeals on his behalf.\n\nAlso the \"completely eradicate transgender*ism*\" you bring up in other comments is literally the &lt;&lt;*I'm not touching you*&gt;&gt; of genocidal rhetoric. If you've never had a sibling put their hand a quarter inch from your face and say that, maybe you wouldn't understand.\n\nLike, if I said: \"I see all these madmen with guns in the news *interacting* with kids at schools and *interacting* with regular people in shopping malls. I wish some madmen with guns would go *interact* with right wing commentators. They'd change their tune about the 2nd amendment real quick.\"\n\nOn the face I can claim that I never made any suggestion of violence. \"Interact\" could mean protesting, or talking. How dare someone say that I was implying a use of violence in that quote!\n\nBut really. The difference between that quote and what Michael Knowles did at CPAC is that I'm not invited on stage to say it by one of the two political parties that together control all law in the country.",

What contexts do people typically use the word \"eradicate\"?\n\nAre there ways he could have phrased what he said to have more peaceful or even neutral connotations? Don't you that think a commentator with a million+ strong audience probably has put a lot of thought into their word choice? Do you think he didn't choose that particular choice of words in part for the connotations that they have?\n\nIn 1928 you could argue that the Nazi rhetoric wasn't genocidal. \"Anyone who even thinks of homosexual love is our enemy.\" If you chose to ignore context, you could believe that they didn't want to kill homosexuals\\*. But the goal of that rhetoric is the same as Michael Knowles: it's genocide. And it's not very well hidden, either. You have to choose to ignore all the context and history and common sense to be blind to that goal.\n\n\\*History lesson: The homosexuals that nazi's genocided a decade later included trans people. In fact, transgender people were among the very first people targeted by nazi violence all the way back in 1933 with the attack on the institute of sexology.\n\nIf you look at context and history, use a bit of thought about why it's being said the way it's being said, it's really quite clear. Michael Knowles is putting forth rhetoric intended to lead to genocide.\n\nPeople using a legalistic view of the words is exactly what he wants. He wants to call for genocide, and gain the power that is entailed by demonizing an marginalized group and calling for their genocide. And he wants to avoid the social consequences by not \"technically\" saying he \"literally\" wants to \"kill people\".",

But using Nazis to make a point, especially when it was one of the worst moments in history, is a glaring strawman argument. I don\u2019t think anyone except the very most extreme people want to call for or think actual genocide is the answer to anything. I have had someone call me a nazi because my views were more centrist and centrists were nazis in history.\n\nI understand what you mean somewhat. If someone said they want to \u201ceradicate all asian culture from public life\u201d, then it would definitely be racist and non-ideal for myself. It doesn\u2019t mean kill all asians. I imagine this to be a parallel to \u201ceradicating transgenderism\u201d, which again would be transphobic and very yikes, but not calling for the death of transgender people.",

You and the example I brought up are on a spectrum of interpretations, hence why its hard to directly say if this person is calling for harming others in the form of hate speech or just against the idea of transgenders (keep in mind I am detaching my views from this because its not about the position, but how to be nuanced).

Transgender people don\u2019t dress any differently than anyone in public and you cannot tell someone is transgender based on what they wear. So I do not see how trans people just existing in everyday life pushes the idea of \u201ctransgenderism\u201d that the right wing commentors talk about. It may be the explicit mention being trans?

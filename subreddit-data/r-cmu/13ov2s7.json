    "postText": "I'm an incoming international PhD student at CMU. During my undergrad, I've always found it hard to socialize and make friends. What are the best ways to socialize and make friends to hang out with regularly at CMU? Or maybe even dating?\n\nI can think of joining clubs, but are they very active at CMU? Personally, I'm into some sports, but not much into creative activities like music. Although I'm not averse to learning anything new.\n\nSorry if all of this sounds silly, just that I've been an introvert all my life lol",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nA buddy of mine is joining the CMU MS ECE program in Spring 2024. In our country, visa delays tend to be fairly common and can stretch up to 4 months. He's worried he will not be able to defer in case of visa issues (as in the handbook it says that deferrals are not generally allowed). Can someone point out whether it would be possible for him to defer a semester in case the visa delays are long (something that's completely out of his hand)? Also, considering he is already joining in Spring 2024 (not Fall), would that be an issue?\n\nIt would be great to know if there are any precedents for this.",

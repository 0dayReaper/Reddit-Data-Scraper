    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I  recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets  of the CMU School of Architecture. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past.  You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them  for what they are.\n\nEvery snowfall brings out the Canadians. You can spot then in any frigid temperature sporting their shorts and acting like the chill is no big deal. However little clothing they wear, they could never outdo the tiny Thai architecture freshman who once braved the famously cold \u201csnow-pocalypse,\u201d wearing nothing but her towel, flip flops, and completely drenched with sopping wet hair.\n\nOur true story began one dark morning as the poor unsuspecting lass was getting ready for the day. She was taking a shower in the communal bath of her dorm tower when the fire alarm went off. Like a gazelle hunted by lions, the frightened archie sprinted out of the shower stall, grasping only a towel and her flip flops before darting to the nearest exit to avoid the supposed fire.\n\nOnce outside, no one was allowed back in until the fire marshal arrived and gave the all clear. The cruel snow kept falling on her long dark hair and turned it glistening with ice. The wind blew through her meager towel like waves of needles. Her feet began to grow numb from standing in the subarctic cold. The agony continued until the fire marshal had checked every wing and floor and gave the all clear. Most people began to quickly trickle back into the dorm. The poor girl was understandably too cold to be as quick as they were in returning inside. By the time she made it to the door, everyone was gone. She had no key card. Just a soggy towel getting heavy with the snow that she had to firmly grasp at all times.\n\nGrumbling at the weather and hoping no fellow architecture students saw her, she trudged through the unplowed fields of snow to the student housing office to explain her unfortunate situation. They were more than willing to provide her a temporary key card but she still had to walk all the way back to her dorm. Thus she marched again through those snowbanks, perhaps with a far more colorful vocabulary than I would care to include.\n\nAt long last, she finally made it back to her dormitory floor. All her stuff was still there in the communal bath. Even the hot water was still running.\n\nNow, no one can be absolutely certain but if ever there was a day when the campus seemed to be low on hot water, on that day it would not take too many guesses as to who used the most. After all, it is the only cure to such an acquired chill.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d",

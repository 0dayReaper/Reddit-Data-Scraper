I\u2019m super grateful to have been from a privileged background where I could afford this without loans or anything and didn\u2019t worry too much about living expenses while I was there. I ate out a lot, went on tons of vacations, etc. and I probably spent 100-110k for three semesters, total. My internship netted me some 35-40k (I got lucky, the same program actually pays less this year), TA roles 5-6k each, which meant my expenses were closer to 60-65k for the degree, which I\u2019ve actually recovered with a company signing bonus and a couple of months of work (again, I\u2019ve been lucky and that isn\u2019t the norm). If you go to a different school, I expect the cost to be even lower.\n\nBefore I came here, I planned to have resources for at least four semesters without an internship in between (~125-150k) so I guess I ended up not needing most of it. But it definitely would get stressful if you graduated into a job market as bad as this one and also had very little resources left. Personally not a choice I would make, but not a completely irrational choice either.",

If you work a full 20 hours, it was usually enough to cover rent + food. But this doesn't help you in the first semester + you need to secure a TA position. And unfortunately, there is no tuition benefit.\n\nI can tell you about budgeting. Though things have changed a lot, notably, there is the food pantry [0] now. I think you can still find a single room (not a studio apartment, just a small bedroom) at 500-600 a month, cheaper if you're ok with roommates. Eating out is expensive (10-20 a meal), but cooking is cheap. Free food is starting to return to campus (usually just pizza). I live very comfortably nowadays at 300 a month in groceries, way back then I could do 50 a month with effort and I think I still can.\n\nThere are relatively few additional fees -- in fact, I want to say none but I'm hedging in case that has changed -- beyond the ones listed on the website (tuition, health insurance, technology, activities, transport). Basically, I think you will not go hungry here (and if you come here and you're struggling, please message me and I'll see what I can do to help).\n\nBut yeah, it's a risky gamble to make. From what you've described so far, I think you can afford coming here, but I'm not sure necessarily that you should. I'm not familiar with the opportunities for the analytics track and I'm not sure how these were affected by recent market conditions. Plus, by going to somewhere else, you could probably become a big fish in a small pond which tends to attract all kinds of opportunities -- in my experience, it's much harder to be outstanding at CMU, you need to specialize to stand out.\n\nIf the difference between CMU and your other options is like 10-20k, then eh, that's a summer internship -- you might as well come to CMU. But if it's significantly more than that, say more than 50k, I would think very carefully about whether you want to risk the financial + academic stress combination.\n\n[0] https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/resources/cmu-pantry/",

Sometimes you have too much work and are forced to eat out, you could get into emergencies that require you to spend big amounts, etc. And most good internships would let you save ~20k normally, I just got lucky. I had two roommates and paid about 500-700$ in rent and utilities depending on use. And not all courses would have TAs work the entire 20 hours, plus like u/moraceae mentioned, you probably aren\u2019t allowed to TA in the first semester.\n\nHow useful is the pantry? I\u2019ve heard they have basic groceries but also that they run out a lot on specific things - is that true?",

The best thing to look at before making a decision would be to look at the fit with the program. I have heard that CMU's MCDS is highly theoretical (I maybe wrong). Would you be able to take that for the duration of your course? Are your ambitions more professional? Do other universities have a more professional angle? You are the only one who can think of such questions which are relevant to your goals. Try to find the right fit. If 2 colleges seem similar, go for lower costs. Prestige beyond a certain point doesn't go that far in the professional world. If you plan to continue with doctoral studies, yes prestige is of greater significance, however student loans will definitely feel crushing as a PhD student.\n\nWhat are your other options? What is your expected compensation post masters? Ask a lot of questions. Ask a lot of people. Do a proper SWOT analysis.",

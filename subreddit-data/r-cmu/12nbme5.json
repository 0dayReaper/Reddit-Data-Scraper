There are some drunks on Friday and Saturday nights, who will occasional break something or wander off with something if you left it on your porch.\n\nPittsburgh Police have a decent visualization of crime in the city, as well:  \n[https://pittsburghpa.gov/publicsafety/crime-data](https://pittsburghpa.gov/publicsafety/crime-data)\n\nI'd either walk to campus or probably get a bicycle that wasn't gonna be wrecked if it hit a pothole.  You could also walk over to Forbes and take a city bus to save ten minutes.\n\nDeeeeeep into South Oakland might be sketchier, and I wouldn't leave anything valuable on the seat of my car, but it's fine for being a person living there.",

            "comment": "I live in Central Oakland and just walk to campus (including after dark). And I've walked around after midnight and so on. I feel safe, but I am male so women might feel differently. Majority of the Central Oakland population is Pitt students (and South as well though a bit smaller %). It is normal when I go out after dark but not super late to see students (including female) returning from late classes. On Thursday-Saturday nights there are many Pitt students going to parties and whatnot.\n\nAlso, have you looked at Pittsburgh bus lines? I've never once taken a CMU bus but I take Pittsburgh ones pretty frequently. 61 goes down Forbes/Fifth avenue between Oakland and campus and beyond and comes frequently. You do occasionally get a sketchy person on the bus late at night, but most of the time it is full of students.\n\nIf you go further West to West Oakland and especially further towards the Bluff it does get more sketchy. Central and South are fine tho.",

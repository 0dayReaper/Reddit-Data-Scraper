The poor elderly driver had her blinker on and was waiting for the former occupant to pull out, just like that episode of Seinfeld. As she safely turned in, a red Ferrari 458 just ZOOMED into the spot and nearly collided with her. When they were out of their vehicles, the Ferrari driver wouldn't even look the other person in the eye. Snob.",

It is absolutely inarguably true that, in my area at least, expensive, show-offy cars are by FAR the most likely to do this. But they\u2019re \u201cjust running in!\u201d Lexus, BMW and land rovers, with Mercedes close behind, are the most frequent cars I ticket by a large margin.",

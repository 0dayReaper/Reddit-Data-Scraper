    "postText": "I got accepted to study in Carnegie Mellon University for a Master's in CS. Obviously it is a leading school in the field and it's a great choice from an academic perspective. However the cost is extremely high (only tuition fees reach 55k) and therefore I'm having second thoughts. Does any current student or alumni have a more clear view on the full study costs and the deductions by potential TAs, or any other form of cost reduction available?",

    "postText": "I love spicy chicken sandwiches. I find the SCS far more dependable compared to the hamburger when I visit a new restaurant that features both.\n\nWhen I came to CMU, I identified Wendy\u2019s (all over Pittsburgh) and Chik-Fil-A (that airport food court) as the two prime SCS locations.\n\nI can\u2019t fall asleep right now, so naturally the best use of my time is to tell you all of a profoundly bad sandwich experience.\n\nLast year, my friends told me a new SCS restaurant was opening up: CHiKN on Forbes Ave. They specialize in (optionally) extremely spicy chicken sandwiches. I visited them twice, once last spring and this past fall semester.\n\nMy criticisms:\n\n1.\tThe chicken itself is incredibly bland. This is increasingly apparent as you increase the spiciness level (which is measured on a 5 point scale that you indicate when you order). The spice comes from a superficial sauce. There is no texture to the chicken beyond dry sinew and muscle fiber.\n2.\tThe spiciness is wack. I describe it as though somebody sprayed a shitty chicken breast with pepper spray. It\u2019s spicy for the sake of being hot, with no dimension or gradient in spice level as you eat. It comes suddenly, and if you have the misfortune of ordering the hottest level, will not easily leave your mouth.\n3.\tThe bread is soggy. No further elaboration needed.\n4.\tThe coleslaw filling has no traction between the soggy bread and slick chicken sauce. Your sandwich will hydroplane itself and leave you with horrendous bread-chicken ratio by the end.\n5.\tGenerally more expensive than I would expect a plain SCS to be.\n\nMy praises:\n\n1.\tTheir highest level of spiciness is truly incapacitating\n\nThe second time I ate there, I ordered the SCS with maximum spiciness. That shit rendered me unproductive and virtually immobile for 6 hours. I was limping between my bed and the toilet as I chastised my dumbass for thinking they would know how to make a good SCS. I do not consider this is a criticism, however, since I got what I inadvertently paid for.\n\nThank you for your time.",

I'm looking to get a diverse selection of responses of undergrads and your help would be greatly appreciated by filling out this out: [**SURVEY**](https://forms.gle/bZyRLaMuco9ZTxaP9). All responses are anonymous, and the survey is mainly multiple choice--should take no longer than 10-15 minutes. Thank you in advance!\n\n(Also, if you'd be interested in being interviewed for 20-30 minutes please feel free to DM me and we can schedule a time!)",

    "postText": "I am an aspiring game designer and I was absolutely elated to receive the admission offer to the MET program at CMU, but the cost of attendance is 112k USD and taking the loan for the same would require us to mortgage our home. Ideally, I would like to go there anyhow but practically I think I would be extremely selfish to risk my entire family's savings for my own dream. But perhaps if I can earn it back manifold it would be worth it? Or maybe I just want to believe that.\n\nI would also like to add that I may want to pursue research options in future, so would the brand name play a huge role in applying for PhD programs?\n\nI have also received admission from UCSC's GPM program, WPI's IMGD program and at UCF's FIEA. If any of you have 2 cents on any of these programs, please do share your opinions!",

That said, the game industry isn\u2019t particularly high-paying, so depending on what kind job prospects you have now it may or may not be worth it financially. Mortgaging a house seems like a big decision, have you looked into scholarships/financial aid?",

Still, even in the best case scenario it can collectively account for near 1/3rd of the tuition? And I won't even know if I will be able to receive them before the acceptance deadline. Sigh.",

Scholarships for international folk are almost non-existent, and I personally don\u2019t feel courses at CMU that don\u2019t give you tuition waivers along with TA/RA are worth paying for, unless you can comfortably afford it. Maybe you could work for a while and save up?",

RDP should work fine on campus, CMU does have a Virtual Andrew Windows environment though if you need access to a particle piece of course software from a PC (a bit better than the VM approach IMO now that Apple's transition to Apple Silicon is almost complete. Virtualizing Windows is still possible albeit the ARM64 version)",

    "postText": "I was accepted to CMU's Pre-college Summer Session program as a rising 12th grader in high school and am looking forward to learning a lot. I signed up for 21-241E, Matrices and Linear Transformations and 15-122E, Principles of Imperative Computing and was wondering if anyone had some advice with taking these courses or advice about the school in general. Specifically, I would like to know how different these courses will be from AP courses in HS and community college courses. Thanks!",

            "comment": "15-122 is killer. I quite literally slept through my AP CSA during covid and got a 5. I thought the pre-req for the class 15-112 was fairly challenging. Most of my friends who have taken 122 said that 112 was a walk in the park by comparison. I don't know if they're watering it down, but you'll be working sun up to sun down in the compressed summer schedule",

            "comment": "I did 15122 and Concepts (21127, a discrete math course) in Pre College 2019. I had some basic prior knowledge on programming in C and thought 122 wasn\u2019t that bad all things considered. It was mostly fun even though the programming assignments were by far the hardest I had ever done. If you are new to C, it will be hard. If you have a basic understanding of C, it will just be a major time commitment. Concepts was really tough and I spent about twice the effort on it as 122. Those classes together were the most difficult thing I had ever done up to that point. It was quite a grind (basically no time to do anything else), but worth it imo. I made some great friends to study with, which is really important at CMU. Another huge tip is to go to office hours. OH exists to help you understand the material better, but in practice devolves into homework help sessions especially for classes like 122. Don\u2019t be afraid to keep pestering the TAs if you are really stuck. \n\nI took 21241 freshman fall during COVID and it shouldn\u2019t have been that difficult, but I think that semester was just hard in general for everyone and math is not my strong suit, especially without people to study with. Still, it was much harder than any of the linalg I had done in high school.\n\nThe great thing about Pre-College is that the condensed schedule keeps things fresh in your brain so you don\u2019t have longer periods where you end up forgetting material. Anecdotally I think the summer classes are easier to get an A in if you can keep up with the pace. \n\nI don\u2019t think AP courses are comparable to any core math or CS courses at CMU. I have heard community college courses are also usually significantly easier.",

                            "comment": "CMU has a small course that helps freshmen get better at skills such as LaTeX, command line stuff, and Vim: [GPI](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~07131/f22/). This doesn\u2019t directly help, but you will be using at least some of these tools in those classes and being familiar with them already will save some time. I never took GPI but did look at the material. Vim is not super necessary, but can be good if your VScode ssh connection isn\u2019t working (as it often does not). \n\nIn terms of materials for the courses, you could try to learn about basic C syntax, pointers, and data structures a bit online (just note that 122 uses C0, which is not the same). Also might want to review basic matrix math (cross and dot products, determinants, equation solving, etc) for 241. I do think both classes are accessible to beginners, but having some prior knowledge gets you a head start.",

There is no textbook, but lecture notes should be avaliable on the course website (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15122/).",

I would maybe recommend looking into 15-112 instead of 122 \u2014 I think it\u2019s a better and more fun intro to college CS.",

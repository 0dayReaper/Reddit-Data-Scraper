Of course the  international student office would give you more specific guidance. Unless you are asking for specific ways to work without proper authorization, which sounds very illegal",

Working on anything, including volunteering your time if it would otherwise have been done for pay is a violation of your student visa unless done with prior notice and approval under the CPT and OPT programs.",

If you are a master\u2019s student, my suggestion is to instead look into entrepreneur visas. There are some reqs for that as well but you may be able to find a good team of folks to do this with at the CMU Swartz Center.",

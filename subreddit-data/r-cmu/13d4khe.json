They're just the undergrad and grad versions of the same course, and usually they're even taught in the same lectures / sections.\n\nBesides the +/- grading (which undergrads wouldn't get even if they somehow signed up for the grad version), the only other difference may be the professor choosing to make certain parts of projects / assignments mandatory for the grad students and optional (extra credit) for the undergrad students. So the use of two course numbers is purely for administrative purposes.\n\n*One example exception is that the grad equivalent for 15-351 is 15-650, while 15-651 is the grad equivalent of 15-451",

            "comment": "Unlike many other master's programs (including others within CMU SCS) CMU's MSCS doesn't really have any program-specific courses -- certainly nothing vocational like you seem to be implying. For CSD courses, 600-level (master's) courses are cross-listed undergraduate courses (typically 400-level, in rare cases lower). 700-level and up (PhD) courses similarly won't have much vocational training, and in fact will typically focus on fundamentals for research. I'm not sure what sort of industry skills and tools (or positions) you have in mind, but in my case I can think of several CSD graduate systems courses that prepared me for relevant industry work.\n\nAll of that said, another distinguishing aspect of the MSCS program is how much freedom you have in the program. If you want to take some of the more vocational courses offered by other departments, you can probably work that out with your advisor.",

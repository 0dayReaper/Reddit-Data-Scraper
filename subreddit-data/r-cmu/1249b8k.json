    "postText": "Accepted by both Tepper &amp; Ross at UMichigan. Both end up same $$ for fam.\n\nI expect to pursue consulting, not super big into CS/tech but I'm strong in math and such (have covered calc 3). Very nerdy academic. Looking for success in job placement.\n\nI'm extroverted yet practical - I hope for more work-life balance than I had at my competitive public hs (I'm a bit of a workaholic, not good), smart/fun-loving friends, and attention from teachers.\n\nI'm a prospective student accepted by more universities than I expected - deciding is excruciating \ud83d\ude05 \n\n**How's student social life? Is Pittsburgh depressing? CMU vs UM reputation from your end?**",

Sports, museums, theatres, recreational options. Probably a little warmer than Michigan but still is gorgeous spring to fall. Doubt you can go wrong either way you choose.",

    "postText": "hello! i'm pursuing a statml additional major and wondering whether i should take 36225 or 36235 next semester. though 36235 is a relatively new course, i heard the prof is really good and that the content is more up to date with the real world - but it's harder than 36225. the 36225 prof is currently TBD but i heard from friends that the professor they had last fall was not very good.\n\nso i guess i'm choosing between a class that's easier but with a potentially worse prof and a class that's harder with a better prof and can maybe help me prepare more for 36236 and other classes. another concern i have is that i'm taking 15122 next semester too and i'm pretty worried about that \ud83d\ude25\n\nif anyone has any advice i would be super grateful!! thank you so much \ud83d\ude46\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude47\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

For a stat additional major, it\u2019s recommended that you take 235 over 225. For reference, I took 122, concepts and 235 at the same time and it wasn\u2019t a horrible semester for me. You can do this.",

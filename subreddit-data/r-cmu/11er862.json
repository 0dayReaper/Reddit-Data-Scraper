I thought that a partial refund would be guaranteed but I had to fill out a waiver for a tuition appeal and the hub said it\u2019s not necessarily guaranteed I will receive money back. does anyone personal\nexperience with this ?????? I would like money back \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude16",

            "comment": "For 11411, taking an intro AI course (15281) or intro ML course (10301 or 10315) would be helpful since it gives you a high level overview of what machine learning is whereas 11411 focuses more on ML models for specific NLP tasks. The coding is in Python so that's not difficult, probably 15112 and definitely 15122 would be good enough. Statistics might be useful, but they review this in class so not necessary. You can always talk to your advisor or email the professor if you want a better understanding of the expected background for a class.",

At the very least, have Probability (36-226, 21-325, or similar) and 15-112/22 under your belt.\n\n80-405: good to have Intro Micro (73-102) under your belt, and Probability and/or Concepts (21-127) would also be nice. I think there's also Decision Theory (80-305) that serves as a very natural prereq for it. Other than that, you could probably go in blind\n\nNot sure about the third course",

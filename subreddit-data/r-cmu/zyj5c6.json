    "postText": "Hello everyone. I'm sorry if this post doesn't fit this community; I can remove it if needed. I'm just about done with my application, and I'll be sending it this weekend. I was wondering if I should submit my SAT scores or not. I took it thrice and got a 1360, 1400, and 1460 respectively, with the highest being 760 Math, 700 Reading. Should I submit it or not? Has anybody with a similar score submit it and got in?\n\nThanks a lot!",

I wasn't, so I didn't submit my test score.  Keep in mind tho that if you don't give your SAT scores, your other pieces of your application will really have to shine.  Good luck, and maybe I'll see you next year!",

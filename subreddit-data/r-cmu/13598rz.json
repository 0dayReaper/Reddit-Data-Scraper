    "postText": "Hi. I am a newly admitted MS MechE student. Prior to begin my study here, I really hope to get some valuable advice from current MechE students on concentration choosing. Honestly speaking, I don't have much experiences in robotics, but I really don't want to miss this wonderful opportunity at CMU to learn it. So please, if possible, I'd like to hear about your learning experiences related to robotics at CMU, both on courses and research. Thank you so much!",

    "postText": "I feel like my experience taking cs courses has been kind of isolating and I haven't been able to make many friends or never had anything like some study group. I'm not sure if it's for the best or not, but sometimes I feel like I'm missing out on learning opportunities. I often wonder the way that the people that finish the homework's the day its released think and sometimes wonder if I'm missing in some way of thinking of approaching problems. I've seen myself grow and improve a lot and make tremendous progress especially considering I never saw myself taking any cs courses or doing anything cs related, but I feel like without office hours I wouldn't be able to survive these courses and sometimes wonder how I would've came up with some stuff without any guidance. I wonder what it's like to be the kind of person who has never needed  office hours. Am I missing out on something?",

As you start taking more 2xx+ level courses you will see whiteboard policies explicitly stated, or at least implicitly understood.\n\nTo quote 210 policy from when I took it, \"To facilitate cooperative learning, it is permissible to discuss a homework assignment with other students, provided that the following whiteboard policy is respected.\"\n\nBut personally, as long as you don't directly talk about / copy / look at solutions with your peers, high level discussions are permissible (and often greatly helpful) in any CS classes in my experience.",

I found SI sessions helpful for meeting new people, so that might be something to consider if you're still taking math classes.\n\nAlso, there are very, very few people who are finishing the 200-level CS homework the day it's released. While you should really try to avoid comparing yourself to other people, I would *especially* avoid comparing yourself to these people. You likely lead a more balanced life than most of them, and that is something to celebrate more so than being some kind of coding whiz (or having the assignments from when you took the class in a prior semester, which is often the case...).",

I feel like everything I do revolves around work and even the stuff I do like have good sleep habits or eating well serve to help me with my work, though I have been able to manage it and stay on top of it, it feels like it's the only thing I've done or am doing. I definitely will consider your suggestion to join ScottyLabs and I was interested in other organizations on campus to extend the content of the courses outside of the classroom or things I could consider pursuing myself and also how to remain consistent in pursuing them with the workload.",

What are you interested in? Is there anything you\u2019ve wanted to try but never gotten around to? Or maybe something in the catalog looks super cool but you\u2019ve never even considered it before (juggling? improv?)? Try to select one org to try next semester and block out the time like you would a class. Once that time becomes unavailable, you will naturally shift your work to different times of day (obviously, there is a limit to this so start with a 1-2 hour/week thing)",

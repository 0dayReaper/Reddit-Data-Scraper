    "postText": "Hi everyone! I just accepted to CMU for biology, but CMU's biology is less well known compared to its CS or engineering. I was hoping if the current students can tell me their experiences with the program (e.g. pros &amp; cons, research, comparable to other schools). Also just for context I don't plan on going into medical school.",

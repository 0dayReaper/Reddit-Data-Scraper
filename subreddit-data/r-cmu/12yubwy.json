    "postText": "Hi, I have recently got a aiv violation notice from my professor for a part of an assignment I made a mistake on. Its my first time and Im a freshman, and I believe I missed/ wrote a part of a problem incorrectly and with slight error of plagiarism. I wanted to ask if it is possible for me to get help and was wondering about the next steps and actions due to the AIV. Can anyone with AIVs in the past help me out, I\u2019m trying to keep my sanity but I\u2019m extremely nervous about it",

(\"A slight error of plagiarism\" isn't really a thing; either you copied someone else's work without attribution or you didn't.) Perhaps that's the first thing to figure out, so you understand what you did and whether it was right or wrong.",

Sometimes plagiarism in its many forms may not have been intentional but is clear and present for a professor to see. You need to go through the process and talk to everyone involved along the way.",

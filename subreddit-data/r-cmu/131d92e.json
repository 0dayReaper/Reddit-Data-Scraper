    "postText": "Can anyone share their experience with TA-ing for course 15121? I recently applied to be a TA for this course, even though I've only taken course 122, as they both cover similar data structure topics. However, I haven't received any interview notifications, so I assume I didn't get the position. If I want to apply for a 121 TA position in the future, what should I focus on preparing for the interview?",

    "postText": "Im a freshman studying at CMU this year, and I was wondering or thinking of taking a gap year next year to get a break from college. I have had a lot of challenges and difficulties during my time over the last semester, so I thought of taking it to refresh my mind and start fresh again. Any tips and advice? Have you seen people take gap years?",

It might be a lot harder to come back after taking a year off. The summer is a great time to genuinely take a break from responsibilities and recharge.\n\nI would highly suggest talking to your academic advisor about it. Seriously, that\u2019s what they\u2019re there for! Talking to them is a required part if the process anyway, so if anyone knows about other students who have taken a gap year, it\u2019s them.",

            "comment": "Certainly talk to your advisor. I think that a gap year can often make a lot of sense, _if_ you use it productively and you're not just engaging in escapism. Some things to think about:\n\n&gt; had a lot of challenges and difficulties\n\nLife can be difficult, and challenges always happen. Were any challenges particularly once-off, or will they reoccur? Which of these challenges are within your control, and which of these are not? What will you do differently next time?\n\n&gt; refresh my mind and start fresh again\n\nWhat will you do after another year of CMU, or after one year of work? Life doesn't typically come with redos. Do you need accommodations for an underlying issue?\n\n---\n\nDepending on your answers to these questions, you might either realize that there's no point to a gap year, that a gap year would be very helpful, or that it might be better to transfer to a substantially less difficult school. To me, \"get a break from **college**\" (emphasis mine) is a warning sign that you may not enjoy your remaining three years at CMU.\n\nUltimately, only you know the real answers to these questions. Good luck either way!",

I took a gap year and I know a handful of other people that took a gap year and honestly it really just prolongs your stay at the university. Almost everyone that I knew that took a gap year freshman or sophomore year had to stay additional semesters to complete their degree or eventually just left CMU entirely.  \n\nAnother point to be made, if you\u2019re struggling academically but are passionate about your field of study I would seriously look into transferring , going to community college for a semester or two to regain some confidence and then transferring into  to your state university. What you don\u2019t want to happen is to struggle and then eventually hit a wall and essentially be forced to switch into a Mickey Mouse major just for the sake of having a college diploma. I knew an individual who switched from ECE to philosophy their senior year and was essentially told he couldn\u2019t switch to any other technical major because of his low GPA. It\u2019s extremely difficult to transfer to a technical major if you struggled your first two semesters at CMU or just have a sub 3.0 GPA. \n\nI was in your situation once and ended up taking a gap year after my freshman year. At this point I try not to think about it but if I were you I would seriously look into my study habits and overall daily routine. If you\u2019re struggling you need to suck up your pride and head to office hours. Try to make friends with kids just for the sake of being able to ask them questions on the hw. You can always turn things around but only you can take that initiative.",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI was wondering whether anyone has any thoughts on 18-095 (Getting Started in Electronics: An Experiential Approach). It looks like it has great FCEs, but I couldn't find anyone talking about it online.\n\nIs the course worth taking for someone who just wants to learn a little bit about electronics, or is 18-100 the better course?\n\nThank you :)",

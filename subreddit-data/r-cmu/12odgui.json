    "postText": "Hey... I was wondering if there was a maximum number of APs that you could get credits from, or if there was a maximum number of credits you could get. Anyone know? And if they can do pls tell me in a reply!!!\n\nI took 12 exams from freshman to junior and got 5's on all of them, which I will list out in a bit. If there is a maximum, which APs are best to use for credits for CS majors?\n\nExams taken:\n\n* APUSH\n* AP Chemistry\n* AP Government\n* AP Physics 1\n* AP Chinese\n* AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism\n* AP BC Calculus\n* AP Language and Composition\n* AP Java (Computer Science A)\n* AP Statistics\n* AP World History\n* AP Music Theory\n\nAlso, which of these exams should I take and prioritize? Exams taking in senior year:\n\n* AP Microeconomics\n* AP Macroeconomics\n* AP Computer Science Principles\n* AP Literature and Composition (maybe not)\n* AP Psychology (maybe not)",

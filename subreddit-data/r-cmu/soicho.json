    "postText": "We\u2019re doing something for a class to try and fix a problem on the CMU campus. Since we were all freshmen at one point and forced to sign up for the meal plan, I\u2019m sure many of you know how much of a **ripoff** it really is. We also know how most people have a *gajillion* **extra** meal blocks by the end of the semester (and they **expire**, *lameee*). \n\nIn order to sell meal blocks, students have to get a big trench coat, a fedora, and sunglasses, then stand on the corner of Forbes and Morewood at night and wait, trying to lure in unsuspecting upperclassmen.\\*\n\nObviously, that sucks ass. So, we tried to make a peer to peer marketplace for block-sellers and upperclassmen, but it turns out not enough people are willing to meet people 50 times just to sell 50 blocks. \n\n**Instead**, you will soon be able to sell your meal blocks online and donate a meal to charity! **How it works** is that you can very easily sell meal blocks in bulk online, we then use the blocks to order food that will be delivered to various shelters, family support centers, and our own low-income students in need (through our own efforts and nonprofit organizations like the 412 food rescue, which was founded by a CMU alum &amp; has worked extensively with CMU in the past!).\n\nBasically, you will get paid $3-5 per block, and a meal goes toward the needy. It is a win-win for everybody. And no dealing blocks at midnight.\n\nWe will hopefully be launching in a few days, but we currently have a sign up process for this beta. If you sign up now, you will get emailed when we launch. This is SUPER SUPER helpful for us since we can get a better sense of the scale and work out logistics for the coming days. \n\n\\&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [theblockprojekt.com](https://theblockprojekt.com)  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nAt The Block Projekt, we\u2019re trying to make the dining system just a bit better for everybody :). If you\u2019re on a meal plan, we invite you to participate. If you\u2019re not, we\u2019d be SO happy if you could share this with someone who is on a meal plan, especially freshmen! Thank you, hope you're having a good semester so far!\n\n\\*shamelessly stolen joke &lt;3",

Get\u2019s been replaced by Grubhub but still wouldn\u2019t you have the same problem of picking up the food? Also that you\u2019re limited to spending 2 blocks per meal time. \n\nThis might be too much of a nosy question, but how do people get paid $3-5 if you\u2019re donating the food?\n\nI think this is a great idea. Coincidentally I am currently in the middle of plans to deploy a discord bot to do block exchanges (there are a few kinks to work out, but the core part of the bot is done). I think donating food is good, but also having the option to buy food cheap as an upperclassman would be good as well. I\u2019ll definitely be on the lookout for this though.",

This works because they know how much to prepare in advance, they can prep in bulk, and they can use leftovers, which saves most if not all the expensive costs (time &amp; ingredients). Also, it's not necessarily 1:1 for when meals get delivered. That being, we get an obligation from the restaurants, for which we can do weekly/monthly deliveries or whatever is easiest for the restaurant and nonprofit programs to arrange. \n\nAs for the bulk aspect, it's mostly the fact that you can sell, say, 50 blocks at once on our platform and not have to worry, look at, or manage anything. Like you said, we will only do 1-2 blocks per day per person, but there is 0 effort required from the student side. \n\nGreat intiative for the discord bot as well! Like I mentioned, we did entertain the idea of a peer to peer marketplace for blocks, but it had bad results in our initial testing for a wide range of reasons.",

Did you collaborate with CMU administration on this? Because even when I sold my blocks, I had to physically go to the location to do the swipe for the buyer. Same thing now that I am on the other side buying blocks from people, they have to meet up with me because I didn't think there was a way to use blocks without actually swiping the card.",

Say my balance is 100 blocks and I want to sell 50 blocks on your platform. My balance will still be 100 blocks, but throughout the year, I have to make sure my balance doesn't dip below 50 blocks because I already sold them, or else I am getting free meals.\n\nBasically, I am confused on how you are able to deduct from a student's meal block account balance without physically swiping their cards.",

            "comment": "I can help you find an apartment! I'm a CMU master's student looking to simulate a transaction where we will do a real time virtual tour of an apartment of your choosing for free. Once we arrive at the apartment, we will start a zoom meeting and show you the apartment as we tour it. If you have any questions or are interested in participating, please reach out through our contact information below. \n\nTo give some more context, this is the motivation for our project: \nFinding a place to live can be difficult, so we are creating a live apartment touring service where someone will visit an apartment on your behalf. This person acts as a neutral third party who can verify apartment qualities that are not obvious through the internet, such as if an apartment smells like cigarettes. \n\nanesathu@andrew.cmu.edu | 781-999-5514\n\nThanks!",

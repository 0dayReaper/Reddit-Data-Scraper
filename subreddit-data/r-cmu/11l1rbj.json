    "postText": "Hi, \nI am graduate student in computer science (MS) at Johns Hopkins University. I am mainly focused on NLP research. I want to pursue PhD focused in same research domain at CMU. I know I still have time for applications, but I need some advice on how to improve my application to increase chances of admission. I don\u2019t have any good publications but working in a research project right now. Also I do my own individual research. Any suggestions or advice on improving my profile or getting research experience is appreciated.\n\nThanks.",

Yours might already be answered!\n\nPlease consider posting to subs like /r/pittsburgh for general life in Pittsburgh questions, dedicated subs like /r/chanceme, /r/ApplyingToCollege, and /r/collegeresults for odds of getting accepted, and using the search in the sidebar.\n\n^(If I've misidentified your post, please ignore this message and instead take it as a reminder to contribute your own answers to the megathread.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

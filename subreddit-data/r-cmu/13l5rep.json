            "comment": "hi, Steiner Realty resident here! personally, I have zero complaints. \nThey're great with maintenance, and all rent payments, complaints, maintenance requests, etc. are on a portal that's very easy to access and keep track of. maintenance is also done quickly and efficiently once you make a request. while I don't know about the deposit returns as my lease isn't up yet, I would highly recommend Steiner. Tree Haven is also right on 5th Avenue, very close to the bus stops for the route to campus. it's also within walking distance (about 20 minutes) from campus.",

    "postText": "Hi guys! I just got accepted as a graduate student in the CS department for Fall 2023. I was wondering if anyone had any advice for looking for housing. What neighborhoods should I be looking in? What is the price per month I should be expecting? Are there any resources for finding roommates? And any other advice you think of!\n\nThank you!",

Alternatively, you can bike; not many students bike and Pittsburgh drivers are somewhat crazy nowadays, but anything within ~10-15 minutes should be close enough.\n\nI currently pay 705 a month for a pretty small room. A regular studio is probably closer to 900-1000 a month these days. If you're ok with housemates, you can get that down to 400-600 a month -- I would join facebook or discord to look for housemates. Alternatively, if you want to optimize for comfort, the generic rich student tends to default to Walnut Capital / One on Center. That'll probably be around 1300 to 1600 a month.\n\nPittsburgh has a lot of slumlords, watch out for those. Always do a search for the property location and the name of your landlord; keep in mind that some landlords rename themselves every few years to escape the bad rep.\n\nWelcome to CMU!",

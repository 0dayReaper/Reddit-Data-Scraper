    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am a rising senior in high school. I am based out of North Carolina. I plan on majoring in Astrophysics. I am particularly interested in cosmology and galaxy formation. I have started my research into short listing colleges. It would be really helpful if I can get some inputs on the Astro major and the department:\n\n1. How do you find the rigor of courses for the Astro\n     major?\n2. How competitive are the research opportunities?\n3. What would you say about the professors and \n     the department?\n4. How is the overall environment at CMU, academic,\n    balanced or hard?\n\nI really appreciate any and all the responses. Thank you very much for your time!",

            "comment": "Won't answer the astropyhsics major part since I'm not familiar with it... But I will guide you about the space programs at CMU.... They exist.\n\nThere are a couple real world space projects at CMU. First is [Iris](https://irislunarrover.space/), which is set to launch in May 2023. Another one is [MoonRanger](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/moonranger). These are under the Robotics Institute within SCS, but I'm sure there is overlap with the Astrophysics program. And you'll likely be able to get into the research program no problem with your major. There are proposals for other space projects, too.\n\nAs for CMU environment, not sure about Astrophysics; however, overall, the school is quite brutally hard. Consider this a good thing because the upside to this is that the classes are so godawfully hard that people will group up together to help each other pass the classes. I believe this should hold true for your major, too.",

            "comment": "I'm a junior going for an astrophysics major. You should definitely be prepared to *work your ass off* (this sentiment applies to all physics and math majors, not sure about other departments). Now to answer your questions:\n\n   1. All of the courses in the physics department including the astro courses are unforgivingly difficult and very rigorous. The difficulty can vary pretty widely depending on the professor, but overall they are quite grueling. This will only make you a better physicist, though.\n\n   2. You will definitely be able to find research opportunities with a professor especially if you are looking to do astro research with machine learning. Research is required to graduate, and your advisors will help you find a research position if you can't find one yourself. All of the professors are very willing to work with undergrads and there are tons of options for any kind of research you might want to do.\n\n   3. The professors are great and super friendly. Some are better at lecturing than others but most that I have had were decent. Most classes are pretty small so you can easily develop friendships with them.\n\n   4. Everyone is really friendly here and are happy to help if you are having trouble in a class. The academics are definitely not balanced. You will absolutely have to bust your ass to keep your head above water, but in the end you will learn a lot. I would say go for this major only if you are absolutely sure that you love physics and math because it will take up a *ton* of your time.",

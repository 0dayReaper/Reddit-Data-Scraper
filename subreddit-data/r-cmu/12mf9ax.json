            "comment": "AFAIK, the only freshman dorms that have a dance studio are Morewood Gardens/E-Tower, since both are connected to the Morewood commons area that has a multi-purpose room/dance studio.\n\nEven though I've been dancing for years, I'm still not quite sure what constitutes a marley floor lol. I know for end-of-semester showcases they do roll out marleys on stage in the rangos (especially for [infra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x5m-0KQgMs) contemp and dancer's symposium) but I'm not sure about the dance studios. I will say that [Studio Theater](https://www.cmu.edu/cohon-university-center/center-facilities/studio-theater/index.html), [Kenner](https://www.cmu.edu/cohon-university-center/wellness-facilities/studio-space/studio%20A%20vt/Excercise%20Room/DSC_5991%20Panorama.htm), [Keeler](https://www.cmu.edu/cohon-university-center/wellness-facilities/studio-space/Keller%20Studio%20VT/Excercise%20room%202/DSC_6031%20Panorama.htm), and [Tepper](https://athletics.cmu.edu/facilities/tepperfitness) have nice floors imo, but I'm not sure if they're vinyl or just hard wood.\n\n5th Clyde is open to all students and can be reserved online by anyone in CMU, no matter if they live on campus or not. That also means that it gets booked out pretty often (like it's almost completely booked out 10am-midnight every day for the next week). However, oftentimes the studio will say it's been reserved online but whoever reserved it doesn't show up in the studio, so sometimes if there's no one there I'll just go in and stay until someone who actually has it booked kicks me out. Same with Morewood. I know for Morewood, you have to email the Morewood front desk to book (which is problematic since they sometimes double-book people), but it's still open for any student to book for any purpose. I've been kicked out of Morewood by a guy doing solo martial arts practice, so it really is open to anyone.\n\nI'm not exactly sure how booking studios elsewhere on campus is, but as far as I know, you can only book those other spaces through a student organization. So if you're a dance leader for DS or KPDC or some other dance/activities org, you can book those spaces for official practice, but not personal use (afaik). This includes UC Kenner, UC Keeler, UC Activities Room, UC Studio Theater, Purnell Studio A, Margaret Morrison 119 (I've actually never seen anyone use this though, so it might only be for SOA students ?), Tepper (idk if people can book it since it's just in the gym lol)",

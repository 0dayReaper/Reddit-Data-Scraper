    "postText": "Thank you guys in advance for taking a look at my essay:)\n\nI am currently a BXA freshman thinking about internally transferring into BCSA. (The program size is kinda small, just FYI, the degree is affiliated with two colleges at CMU and one of them must be CFA.) \n\nThe transferring requirement is similar to transfer into SCS. Both require a sequence of CS core courses with a 3.6 QPA, but SCS has 6 required courses and BCSA only has 4(15-122, 21-127, 15-150, and 15-210/15-213/15-251). I don\u2019t want a late transfer and prefer getting transfer requirement done by the end of my sophomore year, so now I am planning my summer schedule and very likely to attend summer session 1 to catch up. \n\nI am taking 15-112 and calculus 21-122 this semester, so courses I am considering for summer are 15-122 and 21-127.  I understand that both of the courses are pretty tough but I can\u2019t take 15-122 solely because concepts is the co-requisite. Also, this combo is doable for my friends who are also freshman and take the courses in fall or spring semesters,but I am afraid the compacted schedule in summer would make things much worse. So I really wanna to know if anyone has previous experience of taking these courses together in one summer session. \n\nAlso I have thought about the option of taking 21-127 with another gen-ed or smth in summer and finish the rest CS core by junior year(122 and 150 for sophomore year, 210 or 213 for junior fall). I personally feel okay with this plan as well but an earlier transfer is always preferred(so I can take some interesting courses in later years). Any advice on the overall transferring process would be appreciated.\n\nThanks again!",

And they do accept some CFA transfers or BXA with other concentrations each year.I will definitely double check things and talk to advisor on SCS side to get a more concrete plan on degree seeking in the future. No matter what I think I will learn a lot from these two courses as you said.",

I knew a decent number of people with 4.0's who transferred in without difficulty. I do not know of anyone with a 4.0 who did not manage to transfer in (assuming that they wanted to). That is to say, external factors aren't really the problem for most people who want to transfer.\n\nBut I otherwise agree with your post -- people should probably aim to get through most of the minor before making transfer plans.",

I took them together last semester and I found it to be a lot of work tbh but still doable so if you really want to finish as early as possible I would consider it!",

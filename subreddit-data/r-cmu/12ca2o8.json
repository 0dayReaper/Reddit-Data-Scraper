    "postText": "I got into CMU SCS and Georgia Tech CS but I am struggling to decide which to go to. I am full pay for both, but I am in-state for Georgia Tech, so CMU would probably be around 80k/year while Georgia Tech would be around 30k/year. Is it worth it to go to CMU for the #1 CS school and the opportunities, and would the degree offset the cost? My family can technically pay for most of CMU's cost, but it would be a slight stretch. If I didn't come here, how difficult would it be to get here for grad school from GT?",

I met friends for life and had the most productive and intense learning experience I\u2019ve had in my life so far.\n\nMy take is that it\u2019s expensive, but if you plan to go into industry and you get a reasonable financial aid package you\u2019ll pay it off. Obviously it\u2019s impossible to verify what would have happened had I gone to competitive state school, but I\u2019ve been in the industry for about a decade now and will say being a CMU student is a huge boon. The only other school that I see similarly represented at the most competitive internships and jobs is MIT.",

            "comment": "I went to Georgia tech for undergrad ECE (and took quite a few systems and intelligence course from the college of computing), and went to CMU for a SCS master. This all happened very recently.\n\nTo answer your easy question first, it wouldn't too hard to come here for grad school in general, however SCS masters has historically been a bit more selective and harder to get in ([admission stats from 2020](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/resources/masters-overview-comp-data-2020-09-15.pdf)) when compared to some other MS in engineering at CMU.\n\n**Course Materials** \\- My experience is that at CMU, it just simply goes deeper, and offers a better insight when I got out of it. I took both 10-3/601 and CS 4/7641 (Intro to ML at CMU; and ML at Georgia tech, both taught jointly with undergrad and grad students). The CS 4/7641 was of more a holistic understanding, the projects were about learning the behavior of the algorithms, how they react under different circumstances etc, you could easily get an A in the course without actually understanding how the algorithms worked. But 1the same course at CMU would ask you to implement everything from scratch, test you on more nuanced aspects in homework and exams, and cover a lot more material. The same seems to be true with the intro to computer systems course at both schools (15-213 vs CS 2110, the other GT alumni feel free to share some input on this), although this is secondhand so grain of salt. I'm not saying EVERY COURSE is better, but there's a big enough gap in enough courses to leave me with this impression. On top of that, there are a few low level CMU courses that are famous out there (15-213 included). I can't really say the same for GT.\n\n**Research Opportunities** \\- It must be difficult for you to pick a direction right now, if you are even interested at all, so the breadth of available faculties and student involvement programs will be more important here. At GT you can choose to directly work with a faculty, or be in a team that has a project assigned by a faculty (VIP, ORS, to name a few). I have heard that CMU's undergrad are often too busy with their homework so it's rarer to see undergrads in labs, but there's no doubt that a similar set of opportunity should exist for CMU. Some part of CMU's research is TRULY VERY world-renowned. One other thing to consider is that the entire University System of GA [changed the tenure process](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/us/georgia-university-system-tenure.html) in 2021/2022. We have yet to see the impact of this decision on faculty retention, but you will undoubtedly do as you finish your undergrad.\n\nLastly, both schools are good enough that you probably won't have trouble finding well-compensated jobs. GT *~~probably~~* has more parties. Hopefully I shared some useful insights.",

            "comment": "I went to GaTech many many years ago as an undergrad CS and am now a faculty at CMU SCS. Some points that haven't been mentioned yet:\n\n- Class sizes. The number of people majoring in computer science at Georgia Tech (or wanting to) is gigantic. It's leading to lots of challenges in terms of getting into your desired classes, TAs, classrooms, etc. Note that this is a general problem for many public universities, no just GaTech.\n\n- Overall size of university (yeah, yeah, I know GaTech technically isn't a university). One thing I didn't like about GaTech when I was there was the sheer size, in that it has to treat folks essentially as a number. I'm sure there are some folks at CMU that feel this way too, but there is a big difference between GaTech with ~16k undergrads vs CMU ~7k. \n\n- Weather. Atlanta will have less snow (though will completely shut down if there is snow). It took me quite a while to get used to the snow here in Pittsburgh. It's also still one of the things I like least about Pittsburgh.\n\n- I was not particularly fond of Atlanta, though a lot has changed since I was there. GaTech is in a strange part of town with not much nearby. There's not much you can walk to, as Atlanta itself is oriented entirely around cars with no real heart to the city. I like the public transit and general walkability of Pittsburgh. \n\n- Job outcomes and salary will probably be comparable, with an edge towards CMU. You can see the job outcomes for SCS undergraduates in the link below, with average of $125k starting salary and median of $120k\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/career/outcomes/post-grad-dashboard.html\n\n- Broadly, you have at least two good options in front of you. It's hard to make a bad decision, so don't stress too much about it.",

            "comment": "&gt;\tGeorgia Tech would be around 30k/year\n\nDo you not have zell miller/ hope?\n\nI made the same decision 3yrs ago in the ECE department and I can say 100% I don\u2019t reget my choice.  Even I theoretically could have gotten to the same place career wise at gt, from what I can tell from the outside it would have been much harder. CMU is definitely not the value optimizing decision, but for some interests in can be worth it.\n\nMy opinion: if your only goal is be a rock solid software engineer. Go to gt. If your goal is to understand computer science (as in the science of computing) you\u2019ll have an easier time here at CMU.  Also private school rocks and being out of state is a pretty nice experience.\n\nHeresay time: from what I can tell cmu cs students have a much stronger understanding of algorithms and systems knowledge than gt students despite being equally employable. BUT this might be some extreme selection bias based on the people I hangout with at cmu vs my friends at gt \n\nIf you want to try to convince yourself that it makes sense financially check out [CMU\u2019s outcomes](https://www.cmu.edu/career/outcomes/post-grad-dashboard.html) and compare them to GT (which is how I convinced myself the cost was worth it)",

I ended up deciding that the value gained from going to CMU over GT for my undergrad wasn't worth 50k each year, and I would go to CMU for grad school. \n\nGrad school generally has a much higher acceptance rate than undergrad because the applicant pool is much smaller. I right now am once again making the decision of either going to CMU for my masters or another school, so I will say it's definitely possible to go to both. \n\nI'd perosnally say go with GT for your undergrad to get full advantage of in state tuition and scholarships such as HOPE and Zell-Miller, then look to CMU for grad. Of course everyone's situation is unique and while ours were similar, there may be differences that make CMU worth it for you! \n\nBest of luck and congrats on getting into both!!!",

            "comment": "I also went to UMich -&gt; CMU, and both experiences were fantastic (also in engineering, but not Mechanical Engineering).  Here are a few of my thoughts.  From my personal experience, CMU is a bit more rigorous academically (or at least is perceived this way), and that also bleeds into the student culture, which is intense (which can be either a good or bad thing, depending on what you're looking for).  Another nice thing about CMU is that it's a small school (both in terms of number of students and physical size), so Mechanical Engineering is (like all other departments) at the heart of campus.  At UMich, Mechanical Engineering is on North Campus, which houses all engineering departments.  It is very isolated from everything going on in the university.  If you take courses outside of engineering you'll have to trek across Ann Arbor to Central Campus (about a 45 min to walk, so you'll be relying on the bus).  The isolation was a huge issue for many students, especially for those who are assigned dorms on North Campus.  I've also noticed that graduates of CMU engineering, as opposed to UMich, are typically hirable across engineering disciplines after graduation (i.e., a Mechanical Engineering grad would be competitive for a CS, CEE, or EE job as well).  Looking at some UMich pros, as other posters have mentioned, there is a much more active and social undergraduate scene.  CMU has a social scene, but the most fun parts were smaller events like Carnival, which are deeply rooted in tradition.  If you are looking to get a job in the Midwest after graduation, UMich has very strong alumni ties in the area (e.g., Chicago).  CMU has a bit of a better name nationally (e.g., California, NY), but might not have as great of a Midwest network.  You will also have access to a wider variety of courses at UMich - it is simply a bigger school.  Due to its size, however, you will probably have more adjuncts at UMich (at least this was my experience - you can just jump onto the course catalog at both schools to check!).  I won't go into the perception of students at each school (e.g., privilege vibes, how hard working they are) - because while I certainly noticed a difference between the two schools, I'm sure everyone has a different experience!  Last thing (to cap this stream of consciousness).  Regarding the weather, at UMich the snow and winter are (very) terrible.  At CMU, the winter is far less mild, but there are certainly a lot of overcast days (Pittsburgh is known for this)!  You have two great options, so you should feel excited!",

Would you say that a mechanical grad from CMU would be able to enter the aerospace field? Or would that be more difficult than minoring and maybe double majoring at UMich?",

                            "comment": "A degree from either school should open up this opportunity.  As an undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering, you will take the same types of foundational courses at either school: differential equations, linear algebra, physics, mechanics (of various sorts), dynamics, systems, control, etc.  However, you might have some additional elective options at UMich (as compared to CMU) that are more specialized in aerospace because UMich has an actual Aerospace Engineering department (right across the street from the Mechanical Engineering department!).  At either school, you can also gain some additional background/expertise in aerospace if you want to build up your CV by seeking a research opportunity (either during the school year or during the summer) under the supervision of a faculty member who works in aerospace-related areas.",

Could this be explained away by the high concentration of grads in the midwest rather than the coasts as CMU has? Also, if I'm looking to work for places like SpaceX and NASA, which school would you choose?",

I don't know the reason for this discrepancy for sure, but the fact that, as you mention, a large number of UMich grads stick around the Midwest after graduation could be a factor.  Meta employees, for example, make less money in the Midwest than in the Bay Area, but housing and the cost of living in the Midwest (say, Pittsburgh) is less than half of that in the Bay Area, so this makes sense.  Another factor could be, as briefly mentioned before, CMU is very, very well known (perhaps the best in the world) for CS and EE, and Mechanical Engineers from CMU are also hirable in those areas (which will tend to have higher starting salaries).  This will sound like a cop out answer, but I would genuinely say that both schools are about equal in terms of the opportunities they will lead to.  I'd give CMU the edge for being perceived as a bit more flashy on your CV (in terms of prestige) than UMich, especially for undergraduate degrees.  They are a bit more neck-in-neck for graduate degree programs. I would give UMich the edge for having more aerospace engineering courses that will be relevant to your interests.  I'd say the most important thing is to figure out which school has more hands-on opportunities that are of interest to you.  SpaceX and NASA will want to see someone who engages in project-based mechanical engineering design.  They will want to see how you talk about those experiences, because it really gives them insight into your problem-solving abilities.  I would recommend that you ask yourself, \"which of these schools has courses and student organization opportunities that will excite me, and allow for my passion to shine?\"  For example, CMU has TechSpark (sort of like a glorified maker space on steroids) that houses and supports a number of project-based courses and student organizations that work with robots or mechanics.  It is a really engaging space where you can be creative, should you take advantage of the opportunity!",

Very work hard / play hard. Great atmosphere, great community, great profs, great city life. It\u2019s everything I wanted in an undergrad. I joined clubs, made friends, took cool classes, went to office hours, did research with professors, and set myself up for a fulfilling life. All of this is slightly outdated since I graduated 8 years ago. \n\nCMU was\u2026 less thrilling. My masters program was only ok but the grad student culture here is amazing. The campus is majority graduate students so there are lots of activities for older students. My profs kind of sucked (might be particular to my program) and most of them were adjuncts. I never had classes with adjuncts at Umich. I did get that CMU stamp on my resume though and I made a much more diverse set of friends here (even met my life partner in another program). I did great research and really launched my career. \n\nI could say more so please ask - what do you want to know in particular? Unfortunately I didn\u2019t do mech E or a similar engineering major at either school.",

    "postText": "I'm currently registered for 15259, 15213, and 17355. I was wondering how much of a difficulty jump it would be to have 15210 instead of 17355. I wondered if any of these combinations were too tough or doable. For reference, I got a high B in 15122 and 15150, and a mid B in 15251. I'd say I do very well on assignments (especially programming) but mid-on exams. For reference, my last two semesters were 15122, 15150, 21241, and 15251, 21259, 15281",

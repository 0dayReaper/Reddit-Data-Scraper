    "postText": "Hey guys, I was just admitted into the school of Music for composition. Writing music is my passion, alongside game development. I run a small indie studio called Banana Yellow Games. I recently reached out to the admissions office to ask about any game design courses, and they said there were some I could take on campus. What do you guys know about the game dev scene at CMU? Is it worth it? I'm considering going to RPI for exclusively game development. Is the game dev scene fulfilling enough at CMU?",

You will find passionate people about game development here, but the program (IDEATE) itself is not that systematic. The title of CMU certainly helps in the long run, but know that the game industry is small and connections can get you a long way. I came into CMU hoping to do more game dev but unfortunately, it was less than what I was hoping for :(  I was able to land roles I want, but purely from my involvement with the Game Creation Society",

I also applied to RPI's GSAS Program and got in. \n\n* First of all, it goes without saying that you should join the Game Creation Society at CMU if you decide to go... \n* CMU has an ideate minor which has a bunch of their own classes as well as ETC courses you can get into. \n* You can take ETC courses as an undergrad if you email into the classes.\n* School of Computer Science has a bunch of real-time graphics courses that lots of people take. I've met a bunch of music people that compose their own stuff that also want to do games so they ended up getting into the CS rabbit hole.\n\nNow onto my thoughts on the above.\n\n* If you commit to GCS and make games + music, you will learn a lot, and work on teams ranging in size from 5 - 20. In interviews, people have asked me about the games I've made here or made with the people I've met through the club. \n* The ideate minor is a waste of your time. You have a game dev background, you know unity, and you probably know 3d modeling. A lot of the ideate minor classes use Unity will spend a significant chunk teaching unity. every. class. A lot of people take these classes for an easy grade and don't put in the effort requiring someone who's passionate about game dev classes to put in most of the work. \n* I think ETC classes that are taught at the Pittsburgh Technology Center are actually pretty good. The students will care a bit more than the ideate students and you will gain access to the ETC building and its students (which is priceless). If you decide to go here, I implore you to take Building Virtual Worlds as soon as you can. \n* Lots of people that go into Game Dev take computer science courses to take Computer Graphics and Game Engine class. Most of the music majors that have game or game-adjacent interests end up taking some amount of CS classes, sometimes enough to end up justifying the switch to BCSA.",

                            "comment": "The biggest reason was that I didn't want to commit to a niche at the time. I liked making games, but did I want to major in making games? I wasn't sure. I realized during semester 1 at CMU I'd rather make applications using game engine tools instead and that led me to approaching my education very differently. I ended up figuring out what niche I wanted to be in and made my own major (yes you can do that \ud83d\ude09 and I knew that coming in) to let me do it without worrying about requirements. \n\nAs for the rest.. \nAt CMU I'd be an art major (very very flexible program), at RPI I'd be GSAS (kind of rigid). The upside of GSAS is that when you're going up to recruiters during career fairs or job apps you're not gonna get instant rejection.\n\nI had concerns of the competence of RPI's administration and the funding (lack thereof) to some programs. RPI reddit was also super pessimistic.  \nCompared to CMU, RPI is in the middle of nowhere and I don't have a car. CMU also has better name and over all higher quality of people than RPI does. I liked RPI's VR accessibility (cuz I do vr/AR stuff), but if you're in CMU's CFA you can get $500 grants to buy your own hardware. CMU is more generous with financial aid. RPI campus is larger and more depressing than ours is IMO.",

    "postText": "Just got my grade for the last assignment and the test. I can't believe I am struggling with Game Theory taught by Bjorndahl. Maybe I underestimate this course since it is a gen ed requirement for me and mathematics isn't my strongest subject. I know I have spent a lot of time trying to understand those mathematical models and concepts. My other courses are overlapped with the OH and I can only go to one OH for help so far. For those who have taken and are currently taking 80405 now, do you have any suggestions or resources for learning?",

There's plenty of people in humanities and politics.\n\nFrats and sororities really don't have a dominant presence on campus, but they are really the only sources for parties. \n\nIn my opinion, CMU doesn't really support coop programs. Some major-required classes are only offered once a year so doing a coop would really throw you off track",

            "comment": "There are two things I would consider if I was in your shoes. The first is the cost of education, since CMU can be expensive. The second is the quality of education. CMU is a good school, but if you\u2019re looking at Ivies and places that specialize in public policy, CMU might not be your best choice.\n\nHowever, there are some things to sell you on CMU. People have already mentioned the Washington Semester Program and the Pittsburgh summer internship program. I have never heard of someone doing a co-op, and it would probably interrupt your flow to try, but the WSP often includes a full or part time job. You should also know CMU has funding for unpaid or underpaid jobs/internships in DC, usually used for a summer position. \n\nFinally, there\u2019s a also a graduate school of policy at a Heinz College, which offers accelerated (five years total) masters degrees in public policy. I grew up in Pittsburgh and can tell you that several town managers and the like went to Heinz and thought well of it. \n\nAs for the social aspects:\nYou can easily ignore the frats/sororities if you want to, but if you still want parties and a big social scene you\u2019ll have to look a little harder. Clubs are probably the best way, groups like CIA/KGB are very social and several of the ethnicity focused clubs (like SPIRIT for black students) host parties. \n\nDietrich students are a minority, but there\u2019s still a  lot of us and it\u2019s not hard to run into people with the same professional interests. The main downside is that sometimes you\u2019ll feel a little excluded when people talk about CMU as a stem school\u2014I can tell you that browsing this subreddit, it can feel like no one outside CMU knows Dietrich exists.",

Why did you choose CMU? and are the humanities really for a small number of students amongst a sea of CS and Engineering majors? What is social life like for humanities majors? Do you know any grads and what have their job prospects been like? thanks so much",

            "comment": "While Nater's comparison between private/public is fair for almost any industry or grad school aspirants, quant (I assume you mean quant trading) is different.  If you are truly certain that you want to do quant and have what it takes to succeed, I'd argue that CMU is worth the difference in expectation.  But those are two big caveats and most high school students wouldn't have grounds to be confident in either so reflect on that before you take any loans.\n\nFor context I am a QR at a top prop trading firm, interned at a couple more, and interviewed at most firms you've heard of.  Disclaimer:  nothing I say is a statement about the way things *should* be, or that they are *fair* in my opinion, just the way I perceive them to be.\n\nI would estimate over 90% of the quants I've worked with come from a very small number of schools (MIT, Berkeley, CMU, UIUC, Stanford, Harvard, Princeton) and the rest are exceptional geniuses who come from schools that would probably be in the next 10.  This isn't a coincidence.  Of course, people at top schools are probably stronger candidates to begin with and had crazy accolades from high school and being in highly competitive environments with similarly motivated peers makes you work harder and learn more and maybe your classes will be a bit better.  But more importantly, going to other schools means you will have a hard time even getting to a first round interview.  Quant firms are extremely concerned with minimizing false positives in their hires and often prioritize this over hiring in large quantity.  Anecdotally, my firm literally only interviews from 7 schools. When I was an undergrad at a non-CMU top 3 state school, many top firms never gave me an interview.  In contrast, as a grad student at CMU, I had interviews from anyone I wanted to talk to except for RenTech (obviously confounding variables but take it for what you will).  It's also very likely that going to a better school (and other resume things) means you will be held to a lower standard in interview performance because firms will consciously or subconsciously have a higher prior estimate of your \"quality\".  Other resources are good of course and doing research or other internships help.  However, the name alone will remove significant barriers to entry.\n\nOk so CMU can help you get a job in quant but, still, does that make it financially worth it?  I'll just say yes here - there's a big gap between quant and tech and another big gap between top quant and the rest of quant.  If actual numbers are important to you, you can DM me.\n\nAs I said though, you should really reflect on the two conditions at the beginning - do you really want to do quant, and are you confident that you're good enough to make it once you reach the interview stage?",

                    "comment": "+1, as someone who also works in the industry.\n\nQuant (both trading and dev) seems to care significantly more about the college you attend than tech. When I was applying to jobs, I found that I almost always received responses from quant companies but was ghosted fairly often at tech companies. \n\nQuant trading/research may or may not work out for you. It's a really competitive career path and in my experience ~requires you to already have a very strong math background going into college, especially for the top firms. And to be clear, by very strong I mean ~USAMO level strong, not 800 SAT math level strong.\n\nIn contrast, I've seen many more people with less legendary credentials make it into quant dev, and I think it's reasonable to assign a success probability of at least ~30% to get into some firm as a quant dev if you attend CMU and are reasonably dedicated.\n\nI agree that you should reflect on what you really want and on how likely you think you are to achieve it, but I also agree that this is really hard to do before you've entered college. Frankly, it's probably impossible unless you either went to a very competitive high school or were significantly involved in math/programming competitions.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I personally would lean to the side of attending CMU, for two primary reasons:\n1.\tIf you decide you'd rather not attend CMU, it will be significantly easier for you to switch back to NC State than if you were at NC State and wanted to apply to CMU as a transfer.\n2.\tEven if you don't end up working in quant, a CMU degree is extremely valuable for a number of sister career paths (software engineer, data scientist, and so forth), and 220k is honestly not going to be earthshattering in the grand scheme of things for a CMU graduate working any any of those fields.",

            "comment": "You're question generalizes to \"Is it worth paying more for a private school compared to a public school?,\" and the answer is \"it depends.\"  CMU will give you more resources than NC State, including, generally, better professors, better funded extracurriculars, better networks, etc.  But if you don't utilize those resources effectively, then you won't get any more out of the CMU experience than you would from NC State.  If you *do* effectively utilize those resources, though, then it's worth the investment.\n\nAll of this is in the general, but, specifically, CMU's MSCF (note: Master's, not undergrad) is ranked one of the best in the country, so there's probably something to be said for it's undergrad program as well.  You can look at expected career/salary outcomes and do the math yourself to figure out if it's worth it, but if you value prestige a lot, then CMU may be a good choice.  With that being said, if you plan on going for the MSCF, then you can probably get away with doing your undergrad some place cheaper, then applying for the MSCF program later.  Obviously this introduces some risk since you'll be a weaker candidate, and you may also have a subpar undergrad experience, but if you're actually serious about this career path, then it shouldn't be much of a problem (of course, if you're *really* serious, then it may be worth the investment to just do CMU from the start).\n\nPersonally, I think going to CMU as an undergrad is for people with pretty wealthy parents or people who *really* know what they want to do and know that CMU is the optimal path for accomplishing their goals.  Most other people ought to stick to a state school for their undergrad.  Your career path may change considerably as you learn more, etc., and it can really suck to realize that you want to do something else and are now saddled with a bunch of unnecessary debt.  I'd argue, for people who are more sensitive about this kind of money, that it's just too risky an investment considering the volatility of career paths while you're in school.\n\nIn any case, you can do a little research and put some actual figures to all of this speculation (you *are* trying to go to a quant school, after all).  It's all just an investment with different expected returns, so it's not *too* hard to understand how these investments compare.",

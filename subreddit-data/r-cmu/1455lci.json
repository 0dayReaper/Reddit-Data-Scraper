    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI applied in R2 for the full time MBA. Got notified in March that I\u2019m put on Priority Waitlist (without interview). It\u2019s now June 9th and there is still no update from CMU. Emails to the Dean, Director of masters admissions and common mailbox have gone unanswered.\n\nI\u2019ve got a June 14 interview for another uni admit (it\u2019s a Msc program) and I just dunno what to do. Thoughts?",

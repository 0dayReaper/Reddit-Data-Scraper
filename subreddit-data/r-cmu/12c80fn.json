    "postText": "I am an upcoming student in CMU MISM 16 Month Track and will be joining the college in Fall 2023, I received an email asking me to plan my schedule for Fall semester, is that email relevant for students not yet in college or should I ignore it? Because I have just started my i20 process and visa stuff. One of my seniors told me I get pre registered courses in the first semester is it true?",

You create a semester plan then use it to register those classes on registration day.  It\u2019s not totally required but the longer you wait to register the more likely classes you want or need will be full.  No money is due at registration.",

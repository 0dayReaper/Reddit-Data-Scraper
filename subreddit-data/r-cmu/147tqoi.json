    "postText": "I graduated from CMU last year and suffered a lot in my job hunt. The job market is so bad right now. My friend and I both had intern return offers rescinded and had a hard time finding entry-level jobs as new grads. I spent at least an hour every day visiting various career sites to look for new job openings.\n\nI felt dumb searching through these openings manually and wanted a way to automate this process, so we built a job board for ourselves. We thought maybe we could share this with you guys to see if there\u2019s any interest to make it an actual product. Currently, we have real-time SWE intern([https://jobpulse.fyi/Software-Engineer-internship](https://jobpulse.fyi/Software-Engineer-internship))  and new grad ([https://jobpulse.fyi/Software-Engineer-NewGrad](https://jobpulse.fyi/Software-Engineer-NewGrad)) updates for the top 90 companies. Please let us know what you think.",

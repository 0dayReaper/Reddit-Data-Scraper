    "postText": "Current student here. Does anyone know any way to know other people except by using online apps (which does not seem to work well in terms of meeting friends or knowing more people in a normal way.) Kind of trying to know more people within the circle through hobbies and everyday life. I personally enjoy gym, travel, coding, photography, hiking, sports, and watching movies. Did not come out yet (only to close friends), so kind of prefer unofficial events. Can also DM me if a comment is not convenient. Appreciate.",

If you\u2019re looking for romantics I\u2019ve had the most luck just getting to know as many people as possible in whatever I\u2019m interested in, I got to know my first boyfriend through the Game Creation Society.",

You can find them by joining the CMU Discord hub, which requires linking your school email to your discord.

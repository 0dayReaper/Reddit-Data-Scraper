            "comment": "The consensus over the years has been \"buy the smallest meal plan that you can\". You can usually buy blocks below CMU's rate if you really need them (e.g., someone else was advertising their blocks recently). CMU doesn't really do dining halls, more of a many independent shops model, you can check them out here [0].\n\n[0] https://apps.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/dining/conceptinfo/?page=listConcepts",

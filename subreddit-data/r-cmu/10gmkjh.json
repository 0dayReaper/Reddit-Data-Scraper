    "postText": "Hello CMU Community,\n\nWe are a group of students who want to improve the dining situation and the volume of unused meal blocks every semester. We have heard that there are attempts every year to create a platform to facilitate block transactions, and we wanted to know how CMU could have shut them down. \n\nHere are links to the past projects we're referencing:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/soicho/think\\_the\\_meal\\_plan\\_is\\_a\\_ripoff\\_sell\\_excess/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/soicho/think_the_meal_plan_is_a_ripoff_sell_excess/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/spez7p/tifu\\_by\\_trying\\_to\\_fix\\_the\\_meal\\_plan\\_for\\_students/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/spez7p/tifu_by_trying_to_fix_the_meal_plan_for_students/)\n\nPlease let us know if you have any information or experience or could put us in contact with students who've attempted to rectify the meal block situation. Please feel free to DM us.",

            "comment": "The main problem with attempting to somehow take advantage of unused meal blocks at end of semester is that CMU would most definitely shut down any attempts to transfer ownership of blocks. However, CMU can do nothing against students using their blocks within the rules then selling the food to someone else. This is likely why the 2026+ discord activities have not been shut down.\n\nA suggested approach would be to ask students to commit to \u201cselling\u201d some number of their blocks each day/week by using them and selling the food to you. This cannot be stopped by CMU without them passing new, extremely draconian measures regarding the dining plan. However, this requires foresight and risk burden on the part of the student, and they are likely to err on the side of still having leftovers at the end of the semester.",

    "postText": "Hi, I plan to take this course in the next semester. But I heard the AIV detection for this course is very serious. I mean, how harsh will this be? Can I borrow ideas from the internet and rewrite myself? Cause I feel like a lot of people taking this course are copying from the internet and not getting caught. I\u2019m just wondering how this whole thing works for such a large course.",

My experience was there were, at least at a big public, there were wealthy students who were absolutely not capable of being there, and then somehow scored well(which professors *haaaated*) and wealthy students who were not capable of being there and tried to cheat to make it work out. We'd catch a lot of those guys, tbf.",

You may have a scholarship to maintain, or maybe your parents have reverse mortgaged the house / put themselves into crushing debt to pay for your education. You can't even talk about your academic struggles with people at home without feeling like a failure, and you don't have friends at other comparable colleges -- so you turn to the internet which is the easiest form of AIV to detect. I can see this happening for a lot of people.\n\nMeanwhile, domestic students tend to know how the US system works. Lots of \"study groups\" and group chats the size of a small class whose helpful members (friends, former TAs) can help you to \"check if you have the right idea\" or otherwise get you unstuck.\n\nBack when I was actively TAing, I personally disliked participating in AIV cases. We only catch people who (1) AIV and (2) generally had nobody else to turn to. IMO, AIVs are like piracy; a service problem. You don't catch people who have personalized office hours on speed-dial, and they also don't need to resort to searching up solutions to make progress.\n\nYou do get the occasional idiot who submits their friend's assignments from last semester without checking if the numbers changed, though. Not much sympathy for those.",

The most important thing is for you to understand what is allowed, and then not do things that aren't allowed. This is a better approach than trying to figure out whether they'll catch you. I know there are courses where \"what is allowed\" just means \"what the plagiarism detector flags, regardless of whether it's being stupid\". However, I would expect the staff of 213 to be smart enough to use the tools intelligently. So if you are doing something that is allowed, it shouldn't be a problem what the tool says.\n\nNow, if your question is really \"I want to cheat, please tell me what I can get away with\", then please definitely get fucked.",

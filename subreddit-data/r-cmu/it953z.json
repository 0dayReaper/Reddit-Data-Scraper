I often treated the TOC as my beginning-of-interview-season refresher in how to talk to recruiters. \n\n2. It's a good place to find out more about companies you're interested in. You can find out what they're looking for and get advice about how to approach the application process (ex: if the recruiter thinks one of your clubs is interesting, talk about it in your cover letter). \n\n3. You can also find out about job openings that might be atypical of a company. I recall one programming company I spoke to that had a tiny construction services department. \n\n4. Swag (although I guess not this year).",

Even the drug/chemical companies like Bayer were looking for programming, not ChemE. The TOC has been useless for at least a decade. I wrote about this problem to the organizers when in undergrad, I don't think it did anything...",

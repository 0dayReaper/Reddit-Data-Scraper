    "postText": " One furnished room with an in-room closet available in a 4 bed 2 bath townhouse for $500 per month including utilities like gas, electricity, and water (wifi additional $15) from 1st June to 31st July. The window is East facing so lots of natural light, especially in the morning. House is located 1 minute away from the bus stop that is on the route for 61C, 61D, 64, and 93 so it is well connected. Giant Eagle is a 4 minute's walk away. The house also has a large living room, dining room, and a fully equipped kitchen, with a fridge, microwave, oven, stove, and dishwasher. The house also has an in-unit laundry. The rent is negotiable so feel free to message me here.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/on5ja3c993wa1.png?width=1601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2c04417d335c60351a98e3037444d6d4f3c771d7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/617jyj9c93wa1.png?width=1601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=86f0473585beed78afa08f7b645345767c482d10\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qteh66f93wa1.png?width=1613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b4542607a0e25ee4e5b2ff773b51cc61e6d2790b",

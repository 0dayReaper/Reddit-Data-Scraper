    "postText": "I\u2019m leaving PGH around mid-May and I currently have a lease for an apartment in Central/South Oakland that ends at the end of July. I\u2019m looking for one (1) subletter between mid or late May to mid August. Start and end dates flexible. Some information about the living situation:\n\n- 3 bedroom, 1 shared bathroom\n- $650 a month for rent, typically &lt;$100 a month for utilities (gas and electricity)\n- Coin laundry in the building across the street, with 2 washers and 2 dryers\n- Wifi is paid for by one of the roommates\n- Both roommates are Pitt students but they\u2019re chill people who also are very clean :)\n- Closest food places would be Shah\u2019s Halal, Campus Deli, and others \n- 7 to 8 min walk to Forbes &amp; McKee bus stop (61s, 67, 69, etc)\n- The lease can be renewed for 1 year (i.e. for next academic year + summer)\n\nThe subletter would be taking my room, which has the living room in between that and the main hallway with the rest of the apartment. The room includes a bed (bring your own sheet), a desk, multiple chairs, some wire racks where I normally store snacks and stuff, a clothing rack, and fabric drawers to store clothes. There\u2019s also a big window that takes in lots of sunlight!\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks!\n\nEdit: I am not capable of reading my own lease lmao the lease actually ends July 31. My apologies",

    "postText": "Hi guys! My CMU roommate graduated and we are now subletting his bright and spacious room in Squirrel Hill South (Murray x Hobart). If you/someone you know is interested, please let me know! (kinda on a time crunch)\n\nThe room is in a 3bed/1bath place, and it's conveniently located less than 1min away from the 61C/D buses which take you to CMU in \\~10 mins!  The rooms have closets, fans/AC's, all-Ikea furniture, a 29\"/34\" ultrawide curved monitor for you to use. The house has most kitchen appliances, free in-house washer/dryer, a patio, and a front porch. It is only 3mins away from Giant Eagle supermarket, 5mins from Starbucks (and close to many restaurants). Rent is for each room and includes all utilities. Please reach out for questions/more pictures.  \n\nAvailable from 1st Feb to 31st May (and can be extended)",

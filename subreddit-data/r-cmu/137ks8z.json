    "postText": "Hello Members,\n\nI would be applying ED to CMU this fall. I know that I wouldn't qualify for any need based financial aid. That means I am looking at a steep net price. It would be good to know if CMU offers any merit based, work-study or any other scholarships? If yes, what range should I expect for them to chip in?\n\nI do have a quite competitive profile. I would really appreciate all the responses and thanking in advance.",

            "comment": "There are no merit based scholarships for the school year, but the Tartan Summer Grant gives aid for taking summer classes (they consider financial need but also other factors like academic achievement, need for summer classes to graduate on time, etc. and you can get a prof/advisor to write you a recommendation to boost your chances). There are also department specific grants, which sometimes cover costs of summer research or study abroad (I know the English dept and Modern Languages have plenty of these). On campus jobs are also pretty easy to find and pay $10-$15 an hour. Also, RAing during the school year or over the summer is a great way to cover housing costs. The HUB website has a ton of info on scholarships/grants/etc., definitely set up an appointment and find out what\u2019s available for you.",

As others have noted, the only merit(ish) scholarships that CMU used to award (Carnegie and Presidential) are no longer offered. Your best bet to not pay full price would probably be to negotiate with external offers.\n\nWhen I applied (granted, they were still offering the Carnegie Scholarship at the time, which I got), there was a form that you could submit to petition for up to $10k/year more than you were awarded based on competing offers (you had to go through a more extensive process to ask for more than that iirc). I was able to use scholarship offers from RPI and Case Western to get the additional $10k from CMU.\n\nIf you apply ED, you lose that leverage and would need to be prepared to pay full ticket price. It\u2019s an unfair game but that\u2019s the game. Either way, applying RD does not disadvantage you significantly compared to ED, though times have changed and your mileage may vary.",

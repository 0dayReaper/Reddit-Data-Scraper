Really depends on the prerequisite chain for any later classes (which I am not totally up to date on, so check that) and how familiar with ML you might already be. If you can wait and can still take engaging classes, 10701/10715 will teach the topic at a more advanced level. However, if the prereqs allow, I don\u2019t think 10703 or 10707 are so hard they necessitate taking 10701 or 10715 first.",

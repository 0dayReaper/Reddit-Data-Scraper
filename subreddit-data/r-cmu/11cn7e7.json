However, I did not manage to get a feedback about the campus life and also life in Pittsburgh in general. I would like my experience to be formative but also fun at the same time. \n\nDo you guys have any advice to give me?",

Campus has a lot of events and clubs. You may try to join some and see what clicks.aside from the fun things, I highly recommend getting some feedback from a CS student. The classes can be very demanding depending on instructors and TAs.",

Pittsburgh is much smaller than a prototypical large American city, but it\u2019s also much bigger than State College (town where PSU is).

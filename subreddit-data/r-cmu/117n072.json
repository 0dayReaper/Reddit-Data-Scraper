    "postText": "15213 and 15150 sounds painful and idk how useful 150 is if i won\u2019t have time for 210?\n\nhow about 15213 and 15251?\n\nor 17437?\n\n\nwhich one is easier and meanwhile useful? open for other suggestions :3\n\nalso can i take them with 05291 (can\u2019t find detailed info of it but ive taken 05391 and did nothing w processing, looking for some fun courses as 391 but where i can learn more about programming), or 15294+394?\n\ni know this is more than one question. Any help and suggestions would be highly appreciated!",

            "comment": "I will say 150 is fairly useful. Functional programming is becoming an important part of the industry (distributed computing) so learning it would be beneficial. It is also an entirely different way of thinking about programming which I think is important to know about. Courseload wise it is around the same as 122.\n\n15213 is going to be challenging, but the course staff are incredibly helpful. I think overall it is not conceptually hard but it is a lot of hard work because of the sheer amount of programming and debugging you will have to do. Courseload is around 1.5-1.8 times more than 122. \n\nI would advise against 251+213 because 251 is very conceptually challenging and also demands a significant amount of time weekly for assignment. Courseload is around the same as 213 but it is much harder to get an A since midterms and final are incredibly difficult. Ada is one of the best Professor I have ever met at CMU though, if you could fit 251 into your schedule I will recommend taking it before you graduate. It is the class that made me realize I actually love computer science.\n\n17437 is a super fun class. The entire course staff is super chill, friendly and supportive. I think it is one of the most fun class I have had at CMU since I personally loved the experience of building a website from scratch. All the weekly assignments are auto graded so you get instant feedback. They won't go too harsh on the term project and the final is fairly simple. Overall I think getting an A in the class is not that difficult. The technology they cover is a bit old but you can still build fully functioning websites with it. I think you need 213 as pre requisite for this class though. Overall courseload is around 1.2-1.5 times 122.",

I found it a lot easier in some ways/during some weeks of the semester and way harder in others, but overall it probably evened out. Taking it with 213 is fairly common but definitely not easy. Good luck!!",

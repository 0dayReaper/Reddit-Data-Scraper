I would generally just take a PAT Bus right down Fifth, and get off at Fifth and Morewood, the edge of campus.\n\nYou could also do this on a bicycle, but I'd not take Fifth Ave in that case.  Take the sidewalk (on Fifth) half a block, then go one block north of Fifth and go parallel to it, then take the left onto Morewood and go directly onto campus. \n\n(Kentucky Ave, right on Aiken, left on Westminster, past the really really ritzy mansions there, right at the next block, left onto Castleman which is also kinda cool, then left on Morewood and campus is there.)",

When bus approaches, stand at the bus stop sign, face bus, and stick out your right hand. Do not touch cars. The bus's two front lights will blink when the driver has seen you (or is about to stop anyways).\n\n2. Wait for anybody to get out first.\n\n3. Get on bus. \n\n4. Tap bus pass / feed bus cash\n\n5. Take your place. Order of priority:\n\n    - open seat without anybody next to you\n    - any open seat\n    - walk as far as u can to back of bus and stand there. \n\nTry to leave the front seats for people with mobility issues if you are able-bodied.\n\n6. When you need to get off, you'll request a stop: press the (red) stop button on a pole or pull the (yellow) string above the window. Bus will stop at the next designated stop. Try to request early enough to give the bus driver enough time to stop.\n\n7. Get off.",

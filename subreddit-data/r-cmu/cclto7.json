This looks like a question from a prospective or newly-admitted student.\n\nPlease consider using the megathread instead of making a new post for questions about admissions, transfers, and general CMU info like majors and dorms. We get these kinds of questions a lot, and having the answers in one place is more helpful for everyone. Yours might already be answered!",

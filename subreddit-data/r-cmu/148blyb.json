    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am struggling with the following two's-complement truncation problem, which is practice problem 2.24 in the textbook.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cnnv76hnbr5b1.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2f7ecc72d08caca643cd09828f6fa2f76ae9a14f\n\nHere is the answer to the problem:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tujhx0mqbr5b1.png?width=158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2ed9f46004c72b0d60779ce60ae4f164e05bb22b\n\nHow does -2 lead to 6 after it is truncated based on equation 2.10 above?\n\nMy understanding is that -2 is 1110, and k = 3.\n\nApplying the equation 2.10, we have U2T(B2U(1110) % 2\\^3)  = U2T(14 % 8) = U2T(6) = -2.\n\nU2T(6) = -2 because when k = 3, Tmax is 3, so we have to subtract 8 from 6, which leads to -2. But the answer here is 6.",

For some reason, the answer table labels the unsigned interpretations of the numbers as the two's complement interpretation. You cannot represent 6 with three bits in two's complement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Original (2C)|Bits|Truncated Bits|Unsigned|2C|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|0001|001|1|1|\n|3|0011|011|3|3|\n|5|0101|101|5|\\-3|\n|\\-4|1100|100|4|\\-4|\n|\\-2|1110|110|6|\\-2|",

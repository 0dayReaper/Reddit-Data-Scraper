For a \"part-time\" program it seems pretty intense when combined with my full-time job, military obligations, and family. 144 units versus 10 courses or so in other programs really has me thinking I'll have to unfortunately pass on CMU.",

So far, the military people I've met have been generally admitted to SCS proper (MSCS, MCDS, etc) and are _incredibly_ good there. Like easily a couple of notches above typical MS admits or graduating BSCS students good, in terms of technical competency and ability to learn fast. If you're anything like them, you don't belong in Heinz, and I would actually encourage you to not come (unless you just want the CMU name). Waste of tuition and time from a technical standpoint, though maybe OK from a policy standpoint. Again, all opinions my own, maybe MSIT is a hidden gem, etc, but the overall Heinz reputation is rather lukewarm at best.",

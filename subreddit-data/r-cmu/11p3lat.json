            "comment": "If you\u2019re already in SCS, it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to declare a major in AI! \n\nI would recommend probably taking an intro course first tho to gauge your interest (I think there\u2019s an AI mini that people usually take? 07-180 iirc) and then evaluate how you feel about it after that. You would still have to take most of the CS core (everything except for 451) as an AI major, but instead of CS electives you would be taking AI electives.\n\nI would [take a look at this](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/artificialintelligence/#curriculumtextcontainer) and see how much the requirements interest you!",

Personally, the AI classes generally seem to be much poorer in quality for how they are organized. It feels like how I\u2019d imagine a cs degree here felt when the program was new. Expect the classes to be crummy or really good entirely based on how they are organized by the professor teaching that semester. Not to say the material isn\u2019t exceptional though",

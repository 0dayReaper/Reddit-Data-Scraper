    "postText": "I've been trying to get an on campus job forever now to try to pay back some tuition while i have a light schedule, but it seems nothing ever gets past pending or reviewed on handshake. I have a federal work-study, so I thought that would help but theres no way to indicate this on handshake. Is there any other way to get a job on campus or is the demand that high that they're very selective. Really need to make some money this sem.",

Lack of focus today could cause you millions in lost opportunity. As you get older, your ability to absorb new information will plummet, but your ability to earn will skyrocket.",

But generally, they want reliable people who will stick around and show up to their shifts with minimal supervision. If they hire you now, and you take a month to get up to speed, even if you're a perfect worker, they'll barely get a month out of you before you graduate.\n\nThat said, handshake used to have a place to indicate work-study eligibility.",

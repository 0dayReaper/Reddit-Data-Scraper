That said, if you're going to have a chance, the sooner you ask the better as far as seeming like you're planning ahead rather than coming up with excuses.\n\nIn scenarios like this where there's something you wish to be accommodated for but do not wish to disclose to many people, one good strategy (if comfortable) can be to go through your advisor, with whom you can discuss the specifics, and who then can send your professors more minimal emails verifying your need or confirming \"a serious medical condition\" or the like. Your professors are somewhat more likely to then take your advisor's word on it despite lacking information.",

    "postText": "I ranked most of the classes I took at CMU. Some similar classes are combined and some nontraditional classes (such as seminar and undergraduate research) are removed. Dropped classes are not included (or else perception would be in the bottom 3).\n\n50.Bioorganic Chemistry Laboratory\n\nReport 1: 1200 pipettes. Report 2:  1200 pipettes (but in a well plate). Report 3: cut your hand since we had the wrong glassware. Report 4: No reaction. Report 5: report 2 again. Reports 6-8 and the presentation: ?. Classes this bad should not be permitted.\n\n49.Mathematical Methods in Chemistry\n\n\"You can just assume that we didn't learn anything in math methods\".\n\n48.Seminar for Supplemental Instruction\n\nI wish this could be lower. It had excessive busy work, made me sign a contract without the details of the position, and worst of all, made me finish CMU with a decimal number of units.\n\n47.Topics of Law: Introduction to Intellectual Property Law\n\nTaught by probably the rudest people at CMU. At least it is very very easy.\n\n46.Student Teaching Practicum\n\nI forgot I even took this class.\n\n45.Physics I for Science Students\n\nWhy couldn't the crouching lioness come and tell the professor to make sure he taught the material before the test.\n\n44.Computing at Carnegie Mellon\n\nDoes anyone else still play the phishing game? I wonder if the proctoring software is still stealing my data.\n\n43.Concepts of Mathematics\n\nWhy did I take this, it's not even required. At least the professor was pretty nice.\n\n42.Physical Chemistry (Thermo): Macroscopic Principles of Physical Chemistry\n\nAt least the professor warned us the class would be boring.\n\n41.Survey of Western Music History/Repetoire and Listening\n\nI'm sad this class was this low, the professor is very nice. Unfortunately, not much was really covered.\n\n40.Neuroscience and Psychology of Everyday Life\n\nApparently you don't have to take two freshman seminars.\n\n39.Physics II for Biological Sciences and Chemistry Students\n\nPretty generic, I'm still not quite sure what is covered by this class even after TAing for it twice.\n\n38.Systems Neuroscience\n\nGood material, but the mandatory quizzes due at 9:05 AM were very annoying.\n\n37.Writing About Sports and Culture\n\nI don't really like sports, so I'm not sure why I took it. Still a good class.\n\n36.Revolutions of Circularity\n\nA point is that of which there is no part. It was good for a freshman seminar.\n\n35.Physical Chemistry (Quantum): Microscopic Principles of Physical Chemistry\n\nClass is too hard, nerf now.\n\n34.Modern Analytical Instrumentation\n\nWHISPERING GALLERY MODES (is it yelling gallery modes if it's all caps?)\n\n33.Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science\n\nIf you ever take this class, do a game for the final project. You will get a much higher score.\n\n32.Laboratory II: Organic Synthesis and Analysis\n\nProfessor: \"Note color change\". Me: \"Clear -&gt; Yellow -&gt; Black\". Professor: \"-2 you weren't supposed to say yellow.\"\n\n31.Laboratory I: Introduction to Chemical Analysis\n\nI do regret forgetting to fill out the form for group assignments. I was with random people I didn't know for most of the class.\n\n30.Cognitive Psychology\n\nIf only this class did not meet at 8:30. If only we knew anything definitively in psychology and not just a lot of competing theories.\n\n29.Genetics\n\niClickers should probably not be allowed for extra credit. Good thing I got one for free.\n\n28.Advanced Systems Neuroscience\n\nI needed 3 extra units for a minor, so why not take a class that is almost the same as a previous one.\n\n27.Inorganic Chemistry\n\nWhen the professor starts speaking German in class and doesn't realize.\n\n26.Honors Chemistry\n\nThe TA might have gotten in trouble for telling us the answers to the tests. Averages probably shouldn't be 98.\n\n25.Laboratory IV: Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics\n\nMathematica/Ampac/Agui/Avogadro/Gaussian/\u2026 has encountered an error and shut down. Some data may be lost.\n\n24.Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Development\n\nThe professor keeps giving me stickers and the class is interesting. Unfortunately, it meets at 8:20 AM.\n\n23.Global Histories: British Empire\n\nEntertaining professor, even with the high amount of readings and essays.\n\n22.Special Topics in Organic Chemistry and Chemical Biology: Remote Automated Lab\n\ncommandcenter.exe has encountered an error and shut down. Some data may be lost. Fun fact, this class has the longest name of any class I have taken.\n\n21.Biologic Foundations of Behavior\n\nFun class, but the professor forgot to pay me when I was the grader. It was only $50 or so, but I'm kind of salty.\n\n20.Special Topics: Synthetic Biology\n\nSimilar to biosensors, but even more quizes and student presentations.\n\n19.Advanced Organic Chemistry\n\nNamed Reaction #267 - Zincke Reaction. These assignments are ridiculous. Otherwise, a good class.\n\n18.Honors Biochemistry\n\nWho needs the haters, I liked this class, especially the first part. Unfortunately, I have forgotten the Krebs cycle since taking it.\n\n17.Introduction to CNC Router/Woodworking/Laser Cutting/ Metal Jewelry\n\nThese classes are always fun, but they kept getting canceled. I'm surprised I've never injured myself in here.\n\n16.Professional Communication Skills in Chemistry\n\nGood professors and I liked the subject material of my presentation.\n\n15.Hot Glass I/Introduction to Moretti\n\nWhat other class do you get to use a glory hole in? (Yes, that is really what the furnace is called)\n\n14.The Molecular Basis of Polymer Mechanics\n\nInteresting material, nice professor, a cool lab experience. Cleaning out the Schlenck line is not fun though.\n\n13.Cellular Neuroscience\n\nI really took the neuroscience classes out of order, apparently this is not supposed to be the first one. I did get a lot out of it though.\n\n12.Summer Directed Study: Scientific Proposals\n\nThis is barely a class since I was the only student, but I enjoyed writing the proposal.\n\n11.Quantitative Cellular and Molecular Biology Laboratory\n\nA good lab experience, but RIP to all the poor cells we killed since we didn't know what we were doing.\n\n10.Honors Moden Biology\n\nThe most informative class of my first semester. It almost made me switch to biology (I'm glad I didn't).\n\n9.Bioorganic Chemistry: Peptides, Proteins and Combinatorial Chemistry\n\nWe studied whatever the professor was interested in that week. Still a good class, but I know more about the Impossible Burger than I should.\n\n8.Introduction to Biophysics\n\nAfter taking this class, I learned how to go and find the \"tasty amino acids\". The professor is very entertaining.\n\n7.Biochemistry of the Brain\n\nChemistry and Neuroscience, together at last. Don't forget to like and subscribe to the podcast we made for an assignment.\n\n6.Special Topics: Biosensors\n\nVery interesting subject. Would be higher if the quizzes weren't so time consuming.\n\n5.Modern Organic Chemistry I\n\nIt was here that I knew I wanted to study chemistry. The professor is very helpful and nice. The pKa of an alcohol is 16.\n\n4.Redistricting and Representation\n\nNot very relevant to my major, but I liked the class. Maybe the professor will get a certain position (not sure if it's supposed to be public yet)\n\n3.Modern Organic Chemistry II\n\nHad some of the best professors at CMU. I wish I won the face mug in the class raffle though.\n\n2.Bioorganic Chemistry: Nucleic Acids and Carbohydrates\n\nThe most relevant class to what I want to do in the future. The quizzes were unnecessarily difficult though.\n\n1.Transition Metal Catalysis for Organic and Polymer Synthesis\n\nReally interesting, really useful, and really well-taught. The professor's favorite molecule is arshole and I think about that sometimes.\n\n0.Chemistry of Addiction\n\nIt made me feel like I could make a difference. (I accidentally messed up the numbering, so looks like this list is 0 indexed now).",

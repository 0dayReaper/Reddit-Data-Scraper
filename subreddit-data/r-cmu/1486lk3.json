    "postText": "I found an iPhone 5 in an e waste bin on campus (no SIM card). It needed a full reset to turn on so I couldn\u2019t access any info about the owner other than the name being \u201cPaul\u201d. The phone is still iCloud locked, with the Apple ID email being \u201cd*****@hotmail.com\u201d. \n\nAny idea how to get in touch with the owner? If the owner doesn\u2019t want it back (considering it was in the trash), I\u2019d kindly ask them to remove it from their account. The phone is basically useless with the activation lock.",

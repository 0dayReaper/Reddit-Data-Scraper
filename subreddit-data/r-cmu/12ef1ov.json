    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all, I was accepted to Cornell &amp; CMU's Colleges of Engineering and would be super grateful if you could help me decide. I\u2019m planning to major in biomedical engineering, and both are the same cost for me. \n\n  \n**Important factors:**\n\n* *Strength of BME program:* One point: I\u2019d have to take on BME as a 2nd major at CMU, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing (I\u2019d avoid the BME \u2018jack of all trades, master of none\u2019 concern). but any thoughts on this?\n* *Flexibility to take non-engineering classes*: I also equally love humanities/social sciences and want to pursue a minor in philosophy or sociology if able. Also want to have some room to explore other new areas.\n* *Intellectual environment*: collaborative vs. competitive? stressful? I\u2019m not a very strong STEM person as of now, so I\u2019d prefer a place which is supportive.\n   * Also, CMU\u2019s undergrad population is 1/2 the size of Cornell\u2019s. Would this make CMU class sizes smaller (potentially more engaging learning environment)?\n* *Research opportunities*: I\u2019m interested in doing grad school --&gt; industry/academia, and I want to be involved in research as early as possible. Is it harder to do undergrad research at Cornell, because it has so many more people than CMU?\n* *Location*: I don\u2019t mind the rural part of Cornell (love nature), but am concerned about the seasonal depression and possible impact on finding internships. (though Pittsburgh doesn\u2019t seem like a much better location)\n* *CS/ECE, potentially?:* I don\u2019t have much CS experience currently, but given the increasing importance of AI etc. I want to leave my options open, to perhaps take a few classes and explore the bio/CS intersection. CMU is undisputably better in CS/computer engineering, and I'd have the option to major in ECE if I want to. If I choose Cornell, would I be \u2018giving up this opportunity\u2019?\n* *Alumni network &amp; job outcomes:* Both are very well-regarded, though Cornell does have more prestige in Asia.\n\n(I was also admitted to GT engineering, which is my third choice. I narrowed it down to Cornell &amp; CMU, but would anyone advocate for GT instead?)\n\nThank you so so much for your thoughts!",

You have a lot of leeway in tami g non engineering classes, especially if you have a lot of AP credits. \nEnvironment: CMU is very collaborative. The workload means it is best for us to work together on homework and we are not that competitive against each other. We support each other. \nResearch: plenty of opportunities. \nLocation: Pittsburgh wins by a smidge, at least it\u2019s a decently sized city. \nCS/ECE: I transferred into ECE from another engineering major, and I would say it\u2019s a good decision for me. I am also taking CS classes.",

            "comment": "What would be your primary major at CMU? BME at CMU is heavily focused either on neuro/signals or on artificial organs research-wise, and classes kinda align with that as well (though you can still do well in other fields still)\n\nAlso definitely worth taking at least a brief look at GT - it is quite good for BME, though in part because it\u2019s joint with Emory iirc. It is a much larger school though (speaking from experience as a grad student at GT and a CMU alum)\n\nLocation-wise I love Pittsburgh btw - atlanta is kinda meh but Pittsburgh\u2019s bus system is really good so you\u2019re able to get around the city quite easily",

Professor Anna in ChemE also does microfluidics work, though how much of that overlaps with your BioMEMS interests I\u2019m unsure of.\n\nDefinitely wouldn\u2019t go wrong at CMU for either MechE/MatSci primary, just note that your number of electives will be decreased due to doing the additional major\n\nI\u2019ll ask some BME friends here at GT to see what they think of that field here - there are a few BioMEMS people at GT like Craig Forest and Todd Sulchek but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re BME or just MechE. (Not that it matters, you could do research with them anyways)",

            "comment": "I don't know much about the strength of the BME program, but I think both schools are probably equally as strong in that regard. Although, again, I would probably lean closer to CMU in that sense for the reason you stated above: you get the chance to major in something else and DOUBLE major in BME. Cornell, as far as I know, is just a main major or minor.\n\nThis, in general, I think is better at CMU. I feel like the vibe here is that you go so much more in depth in your programs compared to other people, and that's even the case if you aren't so technically strong at the moment. It will definitely change and if you know what you want to do, you can really go deep into that. I felt like I, as an ECE major heavily leaning toward CS, was doing so much more by sophomore year than my friends at Cornell. Part of it is because Cornell has a lot more gen eds / requirements in Engineering (P.E., swim, mandatory bio and chem for every engineering major). At CMU, you hit the ground running in your major. But, this can be a con if you want more time to think about what you really want to do.\n\nI also think the smaller size at CMU is nice. I feel like I see people I know often and it's awesome because everyone is really friendly, I've never felt any toxic or competitive spirit with anyone here. In terms of undergrad research, I feel like both schools have equal opportunities. CMU has SURA/SURF for making research accessible over the summer, Cornell has it's own programs. The biggest difference in this sense is Ithaca vs Pittsburgh: if you do research over a summer, for example, I would much rather want to be in a city versus rural location. But during a school year, you'll have plenty of friends and social opportunities around that you won't feel lonely or depressed.\n\nI definitely think both schools have strong ECE/CS programs. But, some key differences (again, this is from the perspective of a CMU major glancing over Cornell ECE/CS curriculum):\n\n1. CMU ECE is really, REALLY broad, in the good sense. For example, if you're interested in software, then you only have to take two analog circuits courses and then you pretty much take software related courses. If you love hardware, you only have to take 2-3 software courses and do all hardware. You have a lot more variety at CMU, versus Cornell where ECE is pretty much dominated by hardware.\n2. But, to contrast the point earlier, Cornell Engineering has both a CS major and an ECE major. So, you can choose to take intro courses to both topics, and then declare CS if you like CS theory / pure computational biology more, or ECE if you like hardware more. At CMU Engineering, you can't declare CS as your major.\n3. But... a lot CMU ECEs go into software and get the same jobs as CS majors interested in engineering. Ultimately, at CMU ECE, the only CS core courses you aren't required to take are heavy math/algorithms courses. So in terms of software work, you get pretty much the same experience from both the ECE and CS program. This might make a difference for research though. As a CS major at Cornell, I'm sure pure computational biology research is easier to get, while at CMU as an ECE/BME you would more easily be able to work with BME labs on campus. All depends on what you'd rather do.\n\nOkay, this was longer than I thought. At the end of the day, both are solid undergrad schools and you won't go wrong with either. If you want to take it a little slower and get a more traditional undergrad experience, you can't go wrong with Cornell. If you want to delve deep into academics and know what you want, I think CMU might be the better choice, unless you find yourself wanting to be a CS/CompBio major on paper. Let me know if you have any other questions!",

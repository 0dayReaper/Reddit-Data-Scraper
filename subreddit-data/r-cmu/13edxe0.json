It doesn't allow people to exit except at the airport and Robinson town center. As a result, it is mostly people traveling to/from the airport. I would say it feels a bit safer than a normal bus. The ride from campus is around an hour.",

So it was drizzling a little and the bus was supposed to come at 5:48 but ended up coming at like 6:03. So expect like a sizeable delay, or perhaps the bus not to come at all. Once I got in, there was another cmu student (well I didn't know for sure, but east asian dude with a suitcase, was probably from cmu). Some other people started to come in and some of them made me feel a bit unsafe. But I just grabbed my bags tightly and it was fine. Managed to get to the airport without dozing off. It took about 50 min to get there.",

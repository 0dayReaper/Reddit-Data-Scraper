If you can get through that document you linked, you will be set for 601 and better off for it. \n\nLook at the previous course pages for 601 too. Some profs uploaded lectures notes which you could compile into something like the document you linked.",

(And if you are physically unable to take notes for yourself, you should talk to disability resources ASAP because I'm sure they have plenty of experience helping with that)",

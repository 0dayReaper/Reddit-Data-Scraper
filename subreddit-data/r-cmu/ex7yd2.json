            "comment": "These are some early drawings of campus buildings done by the architect Henry Hornbostel. Hornbostel, the first architect for Carnegie Mellon, was famous in his day for the beauty of his perspective drawings.\n\nThe first picture is most recognizable as an early idea for (what would later be called) Hamerschlag Hall. Note the original conception interfaced with the railway in Junction Hollow.\n\nThe second picture is (I think!) where Hunt Library now stands. Since Frew Street was originally the primary road interface to campus, a monumental entrance was planned between Baker and the College of Fine Arts.\n\nThe third picture is looking down Margaret Morrison St. You can see how the building on the right is the back of CFA, which looks relatively similar to how it does today. Between the two buildings, another monumental entrance has been planned, which connects to the monumental entrance in Picture 2. (The left building is the profile of the building in Profile 2.)\n\nThese plans were adapted over time, but overall Hornbostel was successful in realizing his plans, except for some of the more flashier elements. Later, he had planned an eight story dining hall/administrative building for where Hunt Library is, but the plan was never realized due to world events. (Great Depression, etc.)\n\nThis is part of my capstone research. If you're interested in learning more, I'll be giving another architectural history tour this Wednesday at 4:00pm. We'll be meeting directly in front of the entrance of CFA.",

Originally, CMU was a commuter school for technical studies (carpentry, machine work, etc), which meant the original campus plans didn't need student spaces like dining halls and lounges.\n\nOver time, CMU transitioned into a more conventional university and so they built Skibo in the 60s. \n\n*Before* Skibo, there was a hill there. In the 50s the hill was \"cut\" and the dirt was used in part to fill in the ravine that used to be in front of the Carnegie Public Library in Oakland. I think that's a shame -- there was probably a beautiful view there before. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",

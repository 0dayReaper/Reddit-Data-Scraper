    "postText": "Im graduating this sem and will be staying in pgh post-grad. I'm looking for a roommate/roommates who are in the same situation. I'm a social guy who likes to go out about 1-2 times a week. In my free time I follow football, go rock climbing, and cook. I'm open to living in a variety of areas, but I would like to be within a 25-minute bus ride to downtown (where I work). Im open to male or female roommates. If you're interested feel free to send me a msg and we can chat!",

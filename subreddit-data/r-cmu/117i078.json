            "comment": "I don't think the content is super compelling, but Rosenthal did a really terrific job of structuring the course and being informative and helpful with lecture when I took it.\n\nWhile the programming and written homework had a good amount of busywork, the expectations and content were very straightforward. The course slides and resources were all very easily readable, clear, and helpful for the homework and exam preparation. The programming specifically was very long, however.\n\nOne thing I found odd about the class were the recitations. I never attended a single one over the course of the semester, and they weren't super necessary or helpful other than as a review on the concepts (which you could get by reading the slides or recitation handouts).\n\nOverall, I wouldn't say it was a super special or interesting course, but I also couldn't say they did anything particularly bad or were ever unprepared.\n\nHope this helps!",

It\u2019s doable if needed but I definitely felt 210 pushing for more of my time so I didn\u2019t feel like I was able to give as much attention to 281 as I would\u2019ve liked to.

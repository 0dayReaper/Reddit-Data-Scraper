            "comment": "I was a statistic and psych double major doing premed before changing to stat/ml. Definitely doable! I\u2019m personally very interested in research so knowledge in the courses helped me. You\u2019ll pick a concentration (very flexible) to go alongside your stat requirements. It\u2019s good to pair with whatever you need to do industry/continue in academia. I\u2019ve enjoyed all the professors I\u2019ve had, especially Zach Branson and Peter Freeman.",

So far the statistics side of it has not been so bad, provided you put in your full effort and don\u2019t half ass anything. My best advice would be to go to lecture, don\u2019t put off the homework until the last minute, and go to office hours or ask on piazza whenever you are really confused about something. The workload is perfectly doable, just make sure you give yourself enough time to actually do the work to the best of your ability. If you have other questions, I would be happy to answer them.",

The CS side, 112 is time consuming but a great class, 122 is time consuming but makes you think. Concepts is hard but OH are great, Matrices and calc are traditional tough math courses.",

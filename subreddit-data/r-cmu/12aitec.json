    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI was recently admitted to UCLA and CMU as an Econ major, and could really use some advice on choosing between the two.\n\nMy deciding factors are:\n\n* Start-up scene\n   * I've always wanted to create my own business. How are the resources at CMU when it comes to founding startups?\n* Career prospects in finance/consulting\n   * Both UCLA and CMU seem to be non-target schools, so would greatly appreciate more context on this part from current students. \n* Access to resources\n   * How easy is it to access social sci research positions, internships, etc at UCLA vs CMU? Does the larger student body make it more difficult to obtain?\n\nCost of attendance is not a factor. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.",

I\u2019m happy to answer more questions about it.\n2. CMU is a non-target for private equity, but there\u2019s always a way around that. I have a friend at a major PE firm after going the consulting route initially. Cmu in particular tho is great for consulting. Ask around, more people with Deloitte and McKinsey offers than any other school I\u2019ve heard of\n3. Internships have been easy for me to come by and I have heard similar stories from business Econ majors too. As a business major I\u2019ve done 2 semesters of social science research, you can 100% do all 8 semesters if you wanted.",

Not that UCLA is shabby, but it's just not in the same league. If you're looking for a great degree, a school with a rising reputation, and a school where you're a name instead of a number, CMU is your choice. \n\nHowever, if you're looking for other things like school spirit, dating scene, local activities, etc then UCLA blows CMU out of the water. \n\nI don't know how to address your startup funding question. I know that CMU has a history of helping their students acquire funding, but I don't know how it compares to UCLA. I know that every one of my friends in Finance (my major) had jobs before they graduated.",

            "comment": "I'm an Econ major, and I have multiple friends who have gone on to create start-ups after graduation. Feel free to pm me if you have questions!\n\nIn general, I would say that start-ups at CMU are a little less common than at other top schools, and that may be because the workload here doesn't allow students as much time to take on a large project like that. The ones that do get created often spawn out of research that the student does (or vice versa - a student with a start-up idea gets the chance to get research or other credit for it as a student). With fewer startups, there is more support and potential funding for those that do get created, which is a huge plus. As others have mentioned, the Schwartz Center is a really great resource and you should look into that more.\n\nIn terms of Econ, I would say that strictly academically, the program is good and decidedly enhanced by the quality of the Math, Stats, and Business programs. Econ here is very quantitative, which some like and others don't. I honestly think that if you're start-up minded, you may be better of as a Business major instead, but that's something you can figure out once in campus. With a recent change in how the Econ department is structured, it should be easier to switch between Econ and Business.",

            "comment": "Did my masters at Cmu and currently doing phd at ucla. Don\u2019t know much about Econ related fields, so I\u2019m just gonna talk about general vibe and life at both schools. \n\nAt Cmu people are more focused on academics with more or less the same goal in terms of what people want to get out of during the time there. People are more hard working. I wouldn\u2019t say people here are less social but they do have less time to socialize. It can be stressful at times but at least I can handle. I was perfectly happy I did a 2-year masters program here and I have achieved a lot academically and found my career passion. However, if I was doing a phd here, there might be times I would regret coming here since it is indeed pretty stressful. \n\nAs for UCLA, people are more diverse, it\u2019s a lot easier to develop other interests and do different things. The vibe is a lot more chill. If you know exactly what you want but also want to have a life outside of just academics, then it would be a good place for you. If you don\u2019t know what you want, you might be able to figure it out but you might also be lost since there\u2019s just so much going on. \n\nAlso note that UCLA uses quarter system while cmu is semester. They\u2019re vastly different, that\u2019s something you need to consider as well",

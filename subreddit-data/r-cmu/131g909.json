    "postText": "It\u2019s not my intention to complain smth but I do feel like most people around me are on the right track?? Some of them receive intern offers or get a campus job, others are doing well in clubs and activities . But I feel like I don\u2019t have extra time to do anything else beside my work for a whole year and still struggle a lot with GPA. I think the first year in college is usually quite chill compared to the following years. So I am a bit worry about the future right now.\n\nAny suggestion for planning sophomore year would be greatly appreciated.",

It\u2019s very easy to fall into the \u201cI have no time for anything other than class work\u201d trap, but I think if you joined a low commitment club, you\u2019d be surprised how it doesn\u2019t feel too different to be in a club for a couple hours a week in terms of workload management. Try it out and expand as you see fit\n\nAs for internships, I never got one ever in my whole time at CMU, and my career has been fine. But if you want to increase your chances, tools like indeed.com and ziprecruiter are great if you haven\u2019t tried them, and really specific targeted searches for what you\u2019re best at helps a lot (e.g. I\u2019m a software engineer, but I\u2019m really experienced in one specific piece of software, and got every job I\u2019ve ever had by searching job boards using that one software as my main keyword).",

I'm in the same boat, I don't think I did nearly enough to merit being here sometimes, and outside of 15122, this semester was hell for me(mainly because I spent all my time on 15-122). It's gonna be okay :) we have summer, and then I'd rec making the easiest possible semsester for next year.",

    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman at Carnegie Mellon University's engineering and CS programs hoping to pursue a career researching pharmaceutical/drug engineering while tenured at a research university. My main interests include biochemistry, nanoelectronics, materials, and computational biology. Here are some of the degree combos I've been considering:\n\n1. BSc/MS in Chemical Engineering (IMB), BSc in Computational Biology, minors in electronic materials and biomedical engineering;\n\n2. BSc in Chemical Engineering, BSc in Biomedical Engineering, minors in electronic materials and computational biology;\n\n3. BSc in Electrical/Computer Engineering, BSc in Biomedical Engineering, minors in materials engineering and computational biology,\n\n4. BSc in Electrical/Computer Engineering, BSc in Biomedical Engineering, BSc in Computational Biology.\n\nNot necessarily out of these four, what degree combination would you recommend based on my goals?",

            "comment": "I started at cmu with this exact same plan, I took the intro the chemical engineering thinking I would love it and get to go into pharmaceutical research. However I quickly learned that chemical engineering is more aimed at you work at a chemical plant and just churn out whatever drug or product you are told, for me personally the intro class was very eye opening, with a lot of grueling arithmetic, so I recommend taking the intro classes before you try to plan your whole career.",

            "comment": "Personally I\u2019m similar to you in that I have lots of interests and really like biology, chemistry, pharmacology, etc. I originally planned to just major in BME but CMU doesn\u2019t allow that, so I chose Material Science &amp; Engineering as the main major because it has more chemistry involved than Chemical Engineering and is honestly really interesting. My recommendation to you is to not try to do everything at once. You can always get your PhD immediately after undergrad (which you\u2019re clearly planning for anyway) so that you don\u2019t overload yourself right now. So maybe pick two interests to focus on for now that make the most sense for your future career, and then you can go to grad school and specialize in pharmaceuticals. You can also always take electives and do research with your areas of interest.",

So edu is as old as it gets as far as I can tell.\n\nColumbia, Berkeley, CMU, Purdue, Rice, and UCLA all got the first non-DARPA edu domains together on Apr 24, 1985\u2014I\u2019d hazard a guess that the team initially standing up the DARPA registry had strong ties to those 6 schools. Interestingly `columbia.edu` seems to have been registered on July 5, 1985 so IDK what name they had in the initial batch; whatever it was doesn\u2019t exist anymore.",

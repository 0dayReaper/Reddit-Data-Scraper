            "comment": "In all seriousness tho, parking here sucks. Since you\u2019re a freshman and likely will be living on campus, I recommend not bringing a car. Anywhere you\u2019ll want to go will likely be possible via public transportation (free with cmu id).\n\nParking permits are also ~$1500 and insanely hard to get. There are many faculty, staff, and grad students who can\u2019t get permits so it\u2019s highly unlikely you\u2019ll get one. IIRC, permits are awarded in a specific order, with freshman at the bottom of the list. If you want to try, I believe open enrollment is mid july.",

            "comment": "The only reason I got a permit as a freshman was due to a family emergency, otherwise they will refuse to give the opportunity to pay about $150 a month to park. And unless you have family nearby, there are very few reasons to need one. That being said, the garage is available to park in during the day (though it is expensive). The Morewood lot is payed for during week days 8-5 but free overnight and weekends. And there is _some_ street parking around campus. Otherwise the bus system is ok enough to get most places that you can\u2019t walk to.",

If you decide that a car isn't viable, but still need to move yourself in... what if you rent a car one-way instead? It might cost you, BUT cheaper than getting a permit or a private parking space.",

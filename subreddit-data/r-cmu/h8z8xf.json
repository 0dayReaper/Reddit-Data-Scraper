                                    "comment": "I have very little experience with her firsthand, so feel free to take this all with a grain of salt. But I've heard really terrible stories from people who DID experience her firsthand. You can find lots of articles about her dismissal from the State Department; she published, I think in the Tartan, a response to the allegations against her when she returned to the university. It didn't really involve her taking a lot of responsibility, though, and mostly just went back to her arguing that there was more to it than what was said.\n\nBefore that, though, she had a reputation at CMU for singling students out and abusing her power. It's my understanding that when one of the first groups of students in the AMP/IRP program wrote a letter to her with some concerns they had about the program, she responded by sitting them down individually. Not to talk about the concerns, but to berate them and guilt them. I don't know all of the details for sure, but it's something I've heard from and heard confirmed by numerous IPS students.\n\nYou can also read plenty about her views on China online, and plenty of responses explaining all of the many layers of what's wrong with them. She has *quite* a few Fox News appearances you can watch where she talks about them, too.\n\nI will say she has plenty of insight into the workings of government, and she does seem to enjoy sharing that insight with students. But her whole vibe is off-putting at this point; as an LGBT student, sitting across from her, listening to her talk about the workings of Trump's State Department, it's hard not to feel nauseous knowing that she was accused of homophobia and that's how she lost her State job. It's hard to swallow, knowing that the director of my department regularly appears on Fox News and has certain views, and worked on behalf of the Trump administration. \n\nI'll also say that from my personal perspective, the way she interacts with students seems... sorta odd. She'll ask questions, but doesn't seem to be listening to the answer. She'll stand there and force a conversation along with a group who is obviously uncomfortable but afraid to leave, before leaving to talk to somebody else. Maybe it's a matter of my own personal bubble, but... I don't know any IPS student or alum who has an overall positive view on Dr. Skinner. I know a lot of students who were hopeful for a long time, but... not anymore.\n\nI really wanted to like her. When I found out the head of the department was a Black woman with a lot of experience and who seemed to have a lot of respect outside of the university, I was really excited; I thought that maybe it signaled an emphasis on diversity and inclusion. As an LGBT woman interested in a career in politics, that's important to me. Over time, though, the excitement dwindled- first realizing that all of her appearances the department shares are on Fox News, reading through her pieces on China, the State Department thing, hearing other students' and alumni experiences with her, and now with Grenell. I don't trust her, I don't share her views, and I am not comfortable being a part of the department in its current state. I don't feel recognized or heard as an LGBT student. \n\nAnd, to be clear, it's **not** that she's a conservative. It's that she apparently allows her views to apparently influence the way she runs the department, as we see with the current situation, and she doesn't respond to pushback, as we see now, as we saw with her response last summer, and as I've seen in stories of other students' experiences. There were calls for her to be fired last summer after the State thing broke. But almost a year later, here she is, having stayed on long enough for yet another scandal.",

Also, the situation seems to be a bit better than them \"not hating each other\": \"Murphy came to Berlin in mid-October. The Democrat is now the governor of New Jersey, and, unlike Grenell, he is still liked and well-connected in Germany. Through his friend Christoph Heusgen, the German ambassador to the U.N. in New York, he sent out feelers about whether the chancellor might want to meet him for a brief coffee....Merkel politely declined. She didn't want to annoy Trump unnecessarily by inviting one of his most prominent critics into the Chancellery. And then there was Grenell: How was she to credibly brush him off after meeting with one of his predecessors? Murphy understood. Maybe next time.\"\n\n&gt; The wikileaks scandal was beyond any issues the Grinnell had.\n\nActually not at all. Murphy had his name attached to a few criticisms of German leaders that were never intended for public consumption. The German leaders mostly didn't care that much, and he did damage control that was needed in the press.\n\n&gt; Not to mention most of the complaints you read about Grinnell come from left wing German politicians...\n\n\"...in Berlin, he has largely become isolated. The powerful avoid him. Doors have been shut. Few politicians to the left of the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AFD) and the populist-conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), want to be seen with him.\" That's an unprecedented ostracism of a US ambassador to Germany by the government and most politicians.\n\nhttps://www.spiegel.de/international/world/u-s-ambassador-richard-grenell-is-isolated-in-berlin-a-1247610.html",

Then the South became bellwether states voting for the winner between Nixon and Clinton.

I realize that all  universities feel obliged to find a representative of the current  administration for their faculty and that it is challenging in these  dark times where the over-riding philosophy is anit-intellectualism and  fascism, but CMU should not settle just to check a box.\n\nRegretfully,",

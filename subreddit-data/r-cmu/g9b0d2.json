    "postText": "I noticed there's a lot of incoming students here, and thought I'd put something out there before anyone even starts to ask/think about. TAKE C@CM OVER THE SUMMER. Don't play yourself by having to go to class for it for an hour a week for half the semester. Just do it. I know inevitably some of you will think you don't have time to do it; I know I felt that way. You know what I actually didn't have time for? Dragging myself to it in person, attendance mandatory, in the actual semester. You probably have time. Do it.",

You\u2019ll hear more about it once you get in contact with your advisor and get your canvas set up. It\u2019s basically rules about computer use and stuff on campus. Super simple, basic, easy. You get the opportunity to do it online before coming and take the test during orientation, or take it during the semester. If you don\u2019t do it over the summer, it\u2019s a mini- you have to show up once a week for an hour long class where attendance is mandatory and do the exact same work.",

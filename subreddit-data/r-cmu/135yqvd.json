    "postText": "I (a prospective undergrad freshman) have been looking for black communities at CMU, but everything I see seems to be for graduate students or they are more academically or career inclined, like Colorstacks and NSBE. I found an Asian Student Association, a Korean one, and a few others on Instagram and on the website club list, but there seems to be nothing for Africans like other schools.\n\nWhat alternative non-academic spaces exist for black students to form a community at CMU?",

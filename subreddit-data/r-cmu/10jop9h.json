    "postText": "Hi folks,\n\nMe and my friend are going to visit another friend in Rome. We plan to spend about a week and a half there. A third friend (a current Carnegie Mellon student) would like to join us but cannot due to some crazy quantum engineering classes.\n\nApparently if he isn't in the lab they'll fail him. Have any of you found a workaround to a situation like this? I'll take any and all suggestions. Some Ferris Buellers Day Off type scheme would be appriciated. Faking covid has been ruled out.\n\nThanks in advance for suggestions.",

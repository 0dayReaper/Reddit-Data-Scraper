    "postText": "I'm an incoming international PhD student joining this fall. My mental health hasn't been great during my undergrad, and I thought I'll start seeing a therapist regularly once I join CMU. I would be enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP). How good is the access to therapists using SHIP?\n\nI would be grateful for any information regarding this.",

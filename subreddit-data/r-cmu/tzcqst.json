    "postText": "Had to repost this, so if you already saw this sorry!! \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\n\nHey everybody, we're back \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc4b and we're memifying school spirit\n\nFor some more context, our group did a class project where we wanted to improve some part of CMU. We did a dining project \ud83c\udf54 where we students could sell excess meal blocks online and our vendors and volunteers would donate the meals to a charity organization. After more than a hundred signups, the university shut our project down :(. Anyway, after some procrastination we got back and made a meme forum for students, so we can actually pass the class.\n\nBasically, the once great CMU memes for spicy teens facebook group is dead. Insta sucks for conversations. Reddit has no memes. Discord feels too closed off, etc. etc. Our group had a incoming facebook engineer and likely a product manager at reddit, so we wanted to create our own social network to atone for our future destruction of society \ud83d\ude4f.\n\nAnyway, we basically did a hackathon and created a meme forum site for CMU students and we did it in like half a week, so beware of technical bugs.\n\n[starterpack.live](https://starterpack.live)\n\nIt's a social network comprised of a series of micro apps.\n\n* The daily fence- we take a picture of the fence and post it here, plus random TIL-style fun facts for the day\n* Posts- reddit-style posts\n* Live-chat discord like general channel for live chatting\n* Bus-tracker-  enter a bus stop # and know when your bus is incoming\n* Quadruple- wordplay and trivia game based off wordle\n* \\+more coming (digital fence like r\\\\place, cmu omegle, block exchange, etc. once we get more users)\n\nAnyway, come hang out if you wanna hang out and share memes. Anonymous accounts, no sign up, but toxicity is strictly prohibited. It's a meme forum not a place to share your gossip and drama. Thanks all  \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 1 over \ud83d\udc93: Thanks for being awesome guys, haven't needed to remove any comments, remember with great anonymity comes great responsibility",

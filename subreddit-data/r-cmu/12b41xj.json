    "postText": "Specifically, is it worth going if my interest lies in signal processing, digital communications, computer vision, and machine learning? I am limited in the number of computer vision courses I can take (2 max) since they aren't under the ECE department.\n\nThere are some signal processing courses but I do not know if there's anything better about them compared to those at other institutions (i.e. Georgia Tech, USC). I don't find speech processing or audio processing to be super compelling, though they are somewhat interesting to me. I couldn't tell if CMU was strong for digital communications or not. \n\nAll in all, with my given interests, do you think it is worth going to CMU? My other options are cheaper, though not by that much. \n\nAny advice is much appreciated!",

To my understanding, the ECE courses at CMU are tailored towards ML/AI (there is an AI/ML track) and they also have courses like ML in signal processing. I guess these factors should be a plus\u2026?",

From there, you can definitely flex your Computer Vision interest and other AI projects related to robots.... and perhaps get into robotic hardware engineering. What I'm saying is that the opportunities at CMU as a MS ECE are quite broad and very interesting. I don't think you will get these opportunities at most other universities unless you're going to similar universities of extreme prestige.\n\nI also took a CV class. Quality of 16720 is through the roof. It's a great intro class.\n\nSource: I led the mission control software effort on MoonRanger until Dec 2022",

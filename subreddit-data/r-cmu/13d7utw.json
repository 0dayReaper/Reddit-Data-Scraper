Even it has happened in past, but some of the student still curious about what is exactly happening and to be the reason there is a rumor comes out about his round. At that time he became the massive grading rumor. The student, especially his TAs are shocked. He just came out with his grade round which is spread massively. Do you still believe or not, this rumor is really much talked by students even in a person of his TAs.",

I paid 1200 for a pretty nice one bedroom (I'm coming from the NYC area so our definitions of nice might be very different lol). I rented from Mozart Apartments. They have bad reviews on Google maps but I did not have any issues with them. No bug problems, and they responded to problems like leaks and blocked drains pretty quickly.",

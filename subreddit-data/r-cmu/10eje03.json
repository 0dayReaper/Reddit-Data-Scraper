    "postText": "I know CS is the popular major and the one everyone wants but overall how do the two of them compare? What would be the pros and cons to each? This is from the perspective of someone that would be basically equally happy with either major as I've considered both for awhile at both CMU and other schools. I would apply to both but as I am considered a transfer student I can only apply to one. My future plans are grad school and I'd also be considered a fairly non standard applicant (been out of HS for years among other things.)",

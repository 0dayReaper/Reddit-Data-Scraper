    "postText": "I'm an incoming grad student to the MSME-R program and I need to buy a new laptop before I join (my current laptop is falling apart). I wanted to know what specs I'd need as a grad student in CMU. I assume that for any project work where I'd need high computing ability, I could avail lab facilities, but would like it confirmed. If this is true, then I'll probably get a simpler generic use laptop.",

            "comment": "You\u2019ll have access to some pretty beefy lab machines (macOS, Linux, and Windows) along with Virtual Andrew (a Windows 10 VDI environment you can access from anywhere; some department have additional software available too like AutoCad and the Adobe CC suite) and a Linux Time Sharing service. \n\nYou could probably get by just fine with a decent midrange Mac or PC (I\u2019d still stick with CMU\u2019s recommended baseline of 16GB RAM and 512GB though - we do have access to Google Drive and Box for cloud storage for freeing up local storage or working collaboratively). \n\nIt might be worth reaching out to your department/school first though to see if they have any additional info on the recommended OS and specs (some majors might require software that doesn\u2019t play nice with the newer Apple Silicon Macs or ARM Windows PCs, require running virtual machines, or an extra beefy GPU; although with Virtual Andrew you can likely work around the OS requirements as long as you\u2019re using software available on it). Some schools have their recommended hardware specs listed on their site like SoA and SCS. \n\nThere\u2019s also a few selected models available at a discount through the CMU bookstore (there\u2019s a CMU discount through the Apple Education Store, Dell, and Lenovo too if they don\u2019t have a particular model you\u2019re interested in).",

            "comment": "I also grew up 30 minutes from Penn, but I didn\u2019t get in there so I didn\u2019t need to make that decision.\n\nCampus wise, I think they are both very good. I used to love going to the Penn campus because how it\u2019s part of Philadelphia. The CMU campus is similarly part of Pittsburgh, just that Pittsburgh is a smaller but safer city. \n\nCampus food in most colleges is not great. I think street food in Philly is better than here, but I wouldn\u2019t put any weight on that. \n\nCMU doesn\u2019t care for sports much. You can do them if you want, but I don\u2019t know anyone that follows any of our teams. I have heard the volleyball team is pretty good though. Tbf I also don\u2019t know anyone that follows Penn teams other than rowing\u2026\n\nBeing 30 minutes from home is very handy. You have better access to help from family, high school friends, and 0 travel cost for going home. Still, a 5 hour drive to Pittsburgh isn\u2019t that bad. I usually take the OurBus ($50 one way) which is cheaper than the cost of gas and driving alone. \n\nFriends from high school are great to have, but assuming you\u2019re from PA, I\u2019m sure you would know quite a few Pitt students. \n\nI am a CS major, so I would have chosen CMU if I had the choice even though 3 of my high school friends are in Penn doing CS. But I think it is a tough choice. \n\nIf you plan on doing a CS minor with Stat ML anyway, CMU might be better. If you want to do further education at a different school, Penn might be easier because of grade deflation at CMU (otherwise both schools have integrated masters programs). I think the Ivy League prestige does not mean more connections for Penn; at least in tech I think CMU is better connected.",

And I think our theoretical CS is a bit more rigorous than theirs, haven\u2019t really compared other course work. \n\nFor work culture, I would assume both involve a lot of grinding. I know CMU is known for students being really helpful to each other. Most CS class TAs are undergrads as well, so you will most likely be in classes taught by your friends.",

And the ML classes are hosted in SCS anyway which you can just take if you declare with the joint ML+Stats program... Based on this, I think you might be better off with CMU.\n\nATM it seems that if you can get into a specialized major as opposed to a general CS major, you're better off going through the specialized major atm, but it again can change in 4 years, especially if you're committed to ML. CMU is top tier in stats and machine learning. I think it would be higher than most if not all ivy schools, and is directly competing with MIT/Caltech/UCB/Stanford, etc. (I think lol).\n\nOff campus CMU food is fine. Not a far walk away (25 minutes?) you can get cheap street tacos at Las Palmas for $3.50 each. And they're California quality lol. There are other places to eat, too. I don't think the on-campus food is really that bad...... There are ok spots but just ensure you have the smallest meal plan.",

Also, been to both campuses and CMU\u2019s is nice if you like a small town vibe, but access to downtown is only 10 minutes from campus. On the other hand, Penn is literally in the city, same with Drexel and the other schools so it\u2019s like if you want a break just walking it\u2019s kind of a pain.",

There are some kids that breezed through, but they were top percent of class. Your outcomes will very likely be the same regardless of school, just everything else might suck at cmu. All of this of course is just my opinion drawn from my personal experience.\n\nEdit: also it seems like having that established friend is a huge plus for penn",

    "postText": "Hey yall! I'm an incoming sophomore transfer student and was wondering if it's even worth doing the housing application because I've heard that space is quite limited. \n\nI would only consider living in a single, I don't care if it's a suite/semi-suite or anything, essentially I need a private room to sleep in but everything else (bathrooms and kitchens) can be communal (pls don't suggest anything that doesn't have a private bedroom space because I would rather live downtown in the commonwealth). Is there any housing community that has rooms that fit these requirements and is not already filled? \n\nI am specifically interested in Forbes Beeler, Fifth &amp; Clyde, Fairfax, Woodlawn, and Resnik, so if yall have knowledge in regards to their availability please lmk. Appreciate all the help!",

    "postText": "Hello,\nI will be at CMU for 2 months this summer for research. I am thinking that it would be handy to have a bike to get around and explore the surrounding area. \n\nWould anybody be interested in letting me borrow their bike for the 2 months?\n\nOr, would someone be able to share where I could get one cheap?\n\nAdditionally, what is biking like in Pittsburgh for transportation? Are there lots of bike lanes, is the area safe in general?\n\nThanks!",

    "postText": "(Edit:++ thank you for all the advices and experiences  shared here!! ) \n\nJust to make it clear, i think all employees working at cmu are so nice and lovely! \n\n--planning to delete this tm btw so I could completely forget about it\n\n... \nSo I went to entropy at night, and I had trouble swiping correctly for the reader to scan my id. Because I felt bad for the person behind me and the employee, I continuously swiped, reminding myself, \"press down, slowly swipe\". \n\nWhile i was trying, the guy at entropy said something in the lines of, \"Can you just press down and swipe your card! omg it's not a game; just put the item back\", in a tone that indicated how annoyed and frustrated he was. \n\nSo I said yes, placed the item back, and left. On my walk back home, I felt embarrassed and small. \n\nI am assuming that my anxiety while hearing the guy influenced my additional swipes, making me swipe incorrectly. \n\nI'm probably going to try recovering from this feeling after a good night sleep. \n\nThanks for reading! I just wanted that off my heart!",

No offense to any of them, I know it\u2019s extremely hard and I don\u2019t expect them to have a big smile on their face, but they have been quite rude while I check out things and look for cash/card.",

If not then you might need to replace the card.",

From what you've described, it was definitely the other guy.\n\nIt's easier said than done, but it's good to be able to stand up for yourself. Like be calm and confident enough to say \"No, I will try this card one more time, and if it doesn't work, I'll try my other card\", and maybe throw in something like \"how about you be nicer to a customer\" or something if you feel like it.\n\nThe words don't matter - unless you're taking minutes holding up the line and are obviously unable to pay, you gotta learn to dish it back when necessary :).\n\n(Also if you're behind the person and you see the cashier being mean to them, you can always stick up for them - hey no come back it's fine take your time and glare at the cashier on their behalf, or pay for them and ask them to venmo)",

I didn\u2019t have earbuds in or anything, so I would have heard her. I have no idea why somehow it was okay to grab me instead.\n\nThis unfortunately happens time to time on campus, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because there are still exponentially more rude instances with students than with rude employees. \n\nIf something similar happens to you again, DO NOT apologize when you\u2019re clearly not doing anything wrong. Keep a poker face.\n\nPutting the food back is also the very human reaction, but the bottom line of their job description is for them to make sure everybody is able to purchase their food. Deadass if that ever happens again, walk out the door without paying. What are they going to do? They\u2019re the reason you didn\u2019t pay for it in the first place, so it would be close to impossible for you to get in trouble for taking it.",

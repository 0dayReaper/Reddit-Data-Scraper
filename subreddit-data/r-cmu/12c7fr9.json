    "postText": "Which one is better? In terms of research and ROI? Can you guys give your 2 cents and honest opinion which one should I go to? \nAlso is the MS funded if I take up RA/TA ship at Purdue? But to what extent? I have been accepted to the Project Track and still have a choice to either choose the thesis track or get te RA/TA ship until July 15 for fall 2023.\n\nAs for CMU, it's my top priority, but as I am an international student and have a loan, I'm a bit confused. The only downside to CMU for me is the fee. Can you help me choose the right college? \n\nCan you also comment on the quality of both the courses and the fee criteria.",

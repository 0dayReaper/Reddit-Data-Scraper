I am organizing another group of people (I have 3 people total so far) to go try out Emiliano\u2019s in Shadyside for dinner on Saturday (Feb. 4) and I am looking for more people to join!? Let me know if you're interested.\n\nI've been trying out different restaurants on a weekly basis, so if you can't make it that weekend but are interested in joining in a future meal, let me know!!\n\n(All are welcome :))",

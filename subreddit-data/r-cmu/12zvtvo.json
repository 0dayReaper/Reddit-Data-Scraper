    "postText": "As a future CMU student commencing in the fall, I am exploring ways to travel to Pittsburgh. Due to the high cost of direct flights,  I am considering going via New York instead. Could you advise me on the most efficient mode of transport to reach Pittsburgh from New York? I have observed that there are trains and buses available, but which one would you recommend? And do they permit 3 luggage (with some extra charge)?",

Take NJTransit from Penn Station to EWR and then when timed right, a Spirit flight might run around 40-50 bucks or less.  \nIf you miss the timing, then OurBus is your next best option, plus free practically unlimited luggage for around 60-70 bucks at peak times. Usually it picks you up from Hudson Yards and drops you off at the convention center in Downtown Pittsburgh. And then it's a short 61 bus ride straight to campus. If you have any questions about the routes lmk",

Direct flights here are sometimes brutal - Heathrow to PIT is often insane - but connections to get here are very easy.\n\nOr, you're already \\*at\\* the airport, and you've already paid any baggage fees, so I don't think stepping out of a different airport 400 miles away is likely to be the easier choice.",

    "postText": "I'm a current junior in SCS thinking about applying to the fifth year master's program, either in CS or in ML. I mostly hear about how it's relatively easy to get in but I haven't been able to find any statistics for internal acceptance rates, only for the master's programs overall (and those statistics indicate it's actually pretty competitive). \n\nWondering if anyone knows of the current admissions statistics? Or just any anecdotal evidence about the program? Thanks!",

If I recall correctly, we were told that it has a ~25% acceptance rate, which is still quite competitive given that all the applicants are highly-qualified CMU students. In fact, we were told that it is probably easier to get into the normal (i.e. non-fifth-year) masters program despite having orders of magnitude more applicants.\n\nEDIT: after another round of OH it was mentioned that between 1/4 and 2/3 of applicants are accepted.",

Only then you will be out an extra year of tuition and missing an extra year of experience compared to somebody who went directly into industry from undergrad.\n\nIn academia, you get a master's during your PhD for free. The only reason to get a masters in addition to a PhD is if your undergraduate GPA was too low to apply directly to PhD programs. Industry dgaf about GPA unless it was insanely low.\n\nIDK how it is for other industries besides CS, but for CS there's really no point in getting a master's unless you need a better GPA for a PhD program or to extend a student visa.",

Do you think having a master's can at least widen the range of jobs you're likely to be offered? In terms of finding a job that goes beyond just software engineering? I figure having a master's degree would make you a better candidate for fields like ML, NLP, etc",

Students don't seem to understand that academic experience is not a substitute for industry experience, and when I hired for ML we had a strong preference for people who had graduated undergrad and done ML at a startup over just had a coursework masters. Research master's tend to be preferred, where you have actual research/papers in the field you are applying to.\n\nThe thing is, coursework doesn't mean jack shit in industry. Practically speaking, nobody cares about PyTorch or constructing a Bayesian network from scratch at the application level -- and application level is what someone with a master's would be applying to (i.e. not full-fledged research positions, where you might actually spaghetti-code in PyTorch). Coursework shows your intelligence and work ethic, but beyond say 10-701 Intro to ML the specialized stuff isn't useful unless you have practical experience with it.  So master's in ML is most useful when you have good projects and a paper to back it, not just a random selection of extra classes. Make sure your classes count towards specifically the jobs you want to apply to (example: if you're interested in deep RL, study deep RL). Depth is more important than breadth after you've achieved undergrad baseline knowledge.",

            "comment": "Phew! An entire year after graduating, I finally finished revising my undergraduate thesis. But if anyone is interested in why campus looks the way it does, here's a link to the PDF: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iA7Pv-4tcUD6b6sWl\\_YiLxGZNMhDfyHd/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iA7Pv-4tcUD6b6sWl_YiLxGZNMhDfyHd/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThis all came about because Purnell looks a bit fascist, and I heard there was even a small protest when Purnell was finished in 1999 -- students even projected Hitler onto the facade. And so I was curious about how that came to be. What were the administrators and planners *doing*? And the answer turns out to be somewhat interesting!\n\nBriefly, the paper covers three particular construction booms on campus, and looks at how they all march to Purnell.\n\n* The first building period was 1900-1920, with the founding of campus, where the cool 'old' buildings like the College of Fine Arts went up.\n* The second was 1950-1970, with the unorganized erecting of modern structures like Scaife and Hunt.\n* The third was 1990-2000, where there was a careful expansion of thematically similar buildings, including the UC, Purnell, and the football stadium.\n\nEach of these periods link to each other in very interesting ways. And they make campus more interesting to look at! Architectural landscapes come together slowly over time, with each new building relating to the last building or the wider world. But this time element isn't something we see naturally: We arrive and see the 'flat' result, with the interlinking decisions kind of 'smushed' out. But it can be kinda neat to unfold campus.\n\nThis is an Unofficial History, with the major emphasis on making it readable to casual people with no architecture background. (\"Lord of the Rings references are not appropriate in an academic paper\" my professor wrote. But he's WRONG.)",

            "comment": "This is a lovely trip through the 1001 re-re-re-designs of the campus.\n\nI'm going to be That Jerk and nitpick -- at least by 1980, the administration was very vocal that Skibo was *not* a \"student center\" -- which was their excuse for taking away student held areas.\n\nRooms that had been or could have been used as student org offices or spaces were used for administrative groups such as catering and the parking office. [One could argue that catering should be near the food service hub of the campus but it was still annoying; as they grew so did the number of offices they took over.]\n\n(Amusingly, when they built the UC there was much noise about CMU finally having a \"real student center.\")\n\nOh, Skibo, that building we all loved to hate for so, so many reasons. Rest in Rubble.\n\nAlso:\n&gt;In the 70s and 80s, decades\nthat lionized individuals and fetishized macho leadership, Richard Cyert was the perfect man.\n\nThis is hilarious.",

I have time conflict with their OH, otherwise would\u2019ve asked in-person there. I just need to know soon so I can reach out to another professor before it gets too close to the deadline",

Ask them if they would consider it in-person, but let them know you're going to send a follow-up email later that day as well. That way they're not necessarily put on the spot, but they'll have a record of the request via email.",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019ll be joining CMU as a grad student in Fall 2023 and I\u2019m confused between taking 10-605 and 10-745. If anyone has taken them, would you be able to tell me what the major differences are between the courses?\n\nI\u2019m looking for a practical big data and ML course that would help me in the industry, rather than a research-oriented course. I\u2019d also like to gauge the difficulty of taking this course with 15-619. \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "10-745 looks to be a Phd level course more focused on preparing students to do research.  I took 10-605 back in 2019.  You will read some research papers, but the course is more hands on and geared towards practitioners in ML. That's the one that you want.   I didn't find it that challenging, nor the workload to be out of hand.  But it was the only class that I took that semester (I'm a staff member with a full-time job at CMU)",

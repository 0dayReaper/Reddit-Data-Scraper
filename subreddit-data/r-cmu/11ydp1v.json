    "postText": "Got this the beginning of march\nDear xxx,\n\nHello from Carnegie Mellon University!\n\nThis is xxxx xxxx, your main point of contact here at Carnegie Mellon. I wanted to check in again to see if I could assist with any questions about admission, financial aid, academics, our campus community or anything else.\n\nAdmission decisions will be released at the end of March, so I especially want to make sure that, if you've applied for financial aid, you have all your questions about your aid application answered. If you haven't yet started your financial aid application, you can find directions here. Our Net Price Calculator is also a great tool to help you and your family understand an estimate of your aid from Carnegie Mellon.\n\nIf you'd like to connect over Zoom and talk through any questions or concerns that you have, I'd encourage you to join our Partnership and Access Support System (PASS) network by registering for an online counselor chat.\n\nSchedule a PASS counselor chat here!\n\nIf you can't find a time that works for you, please reply to this email with your availability for a 20 - 30 minute meeting during regular business hours, and we can schedule our chat within the next week or so. You're welcome to invite family or caregivers to join you. \n\nI look forward to connecting with you soon!",

Yours might already be answered!\n\nPlease consider posting to subs like /r/pittsburgh for general life in Pittsburgh questions, dedicated subs like /r/chanceme, /r/ApplyingToCollege, and /r/collegeresults for odds of getting accepted, and using the search in the sidebar.\n\n^(If I've misidentified your post, please ignore this message and instead take it as a reminder to contribute your own answers to the megathread.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "postText": "I am an alum and my CMU content (gmail, Drive, Canvas, Gradescope) will no longer be available soon. Computing services provides instructions on how to migrate and save Gmail and Drive content seamlessly, but I am finding that saving my Canvas and Gradescope content is very tedious. For example, on Canvas I have to go to each course and download the files. Are there any alums who downloaded their Canvas or Gradescope content and know of a more seamless way to do this?",

They manage the Canvas LMS and should be able to advise either way.\n\nIf they say there\u2019s nothing they can do at first, don\u2019t hesitate to follow up with something like \u201care you sure there\u2019s nothing you can do?\u201d (Obviously include more than that though) Sometimes persistence goes a long way.",

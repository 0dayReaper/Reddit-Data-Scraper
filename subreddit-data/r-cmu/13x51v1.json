Meal plan wise, best bet is probably just cook for yourself kinda thing.\n\nVisiting, definitely check out the museums around especially if you get free access (again, unsure how visiting status works but CMU students get free access to a bunch of museums in the area, there should be a lost somewhere of them). Would also recommend going to a pirates game - they have one of the most scenic ballparks in the country, and the team\u2019s not half bad this year.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI currently live in a great, spacious 1B apartment in North Oakland on Centre Ave and am looking for someone to take over my lease starting June 1st. Reasonable rent, 0 issues with the maintenance company/landlord, and a straight 10-15 min walk to campus. Would totally stay if I wasn\u2019t moving from Pittsburgh. However, I\u2019m looking for someone to take over my lease starting June 1st so I can move out. Posting here bc I had a nightmare time apartment hunting before and ended up in a horrible situation (never rent with nexus real estate \ud83e\udee0) before living here. It\u2019s a lovely apartment in a great location. Message me if you\u2019re interested and I can send the official website listing :)",

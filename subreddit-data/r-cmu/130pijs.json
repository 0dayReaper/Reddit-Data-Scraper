    "postText": "Hi everyone, I got admitted to a summer program at CMU Heinz not too long ago and accepted my offer last week. I was wondering what CMU is like over the summer and if there's really any student life or the like. I know I won't get the full experience of being a CMU student given 1. it's during summer break and 2. I'll only be there for 7 weeks, but I'm still curious if there are events or things to partake in during my time there, and I'd love to make some friends from the North while I have the chance. \n\nIf anyone has any recommendations of things to do, see, or eat while I'm there, I'd love to hear them as well. Thanks!",

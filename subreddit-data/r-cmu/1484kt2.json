    "postText": "Hey all! This summer I will be a visiting student to Carnegie Mellon from July 1 to September 18. I have rent a room starting from July 1 to August 18. But I am worried about potential housing options from August 18 to September 18 since most students at Carnegie Mellon will come back. Does anyone have recommendations for this period? Thanks so much!",

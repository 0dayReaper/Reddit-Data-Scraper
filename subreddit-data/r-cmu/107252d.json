Also as a person who took the review, I would say it was not as formal as other arch schools\u2019 interviews and only took 15 mins or so to finish. Very limited parts in my portfolio were discussed.",

Some other factors include regional geography of where your from, work experience, passion and set of goals for cmu. Etc and then also your portfolio. This is according to my grad admissions experience hope that helps",

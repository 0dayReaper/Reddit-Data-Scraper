    "postText": "Hello folks!\n\nI\u2019m a prospective grad student - Fall 23 for MS in Energy Science, Technology and Policy for the applied advanced study.\n\nI recently saw the post here asking about the party culture of the Uni and the comment section was filled with how there\u2019s no such culture and instead there is just a lot of burnout, exhaustion and sleepless nights because of the workload. \n\nI wanted to know if this is true, and in case it is, what are the best parts of CMU that allow you to have the university experience that you remember fondly.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m deciding between UMich SEAS and CMU EST&amp;P and figuring out what I should do/where I should go taking into account culture, rigour of the Uni etc as well.",

They\u2019re all from different programs than me and our social circle keeps expanding. There are so many incredible people here. And yes, we did party, both out at bars and at fun house parties. We also had game nights, dinners/potlucks, and other hang outs. The best part about CMU is the people you get to meet and become friends with here.",

While the homework is really tough and can be very exhausting, I actually find that a lot of them can be fun (with how much you learn at the end). I plan on playing hard during breaks next year and fly out with friends :)",

I and most of my friends don\u2019t really like the idea of big parties like that. We prefer smaller events and are really satisfied with just hanging out with a dozen or so people. If you were looking for some though, you could easily make friends with the right people literally down the road. \n\nIn terms of work and grinding it is true, but it really depends on your program. In particular MS programs in some departments tend to have a lot of \u2018mini\u2019 classes which other MS students have told me are stressful. I know the CS programs don\u2019t have this, idk about Engineering. I would say it\u2019s manageable if you make good friends; collaboration is the norm.",

My fellow grad students in my program are nice people and they plan other events for our department along with little things like doing stuff around the city or going to the gym.\n\nEveryone is really collaborative and it is also a treat being a TA and seeing the next generation of leaders coming through the system and being part of forming them is really special.\n\nI personally don\u2019t value partying or anything like that, but GSA puts on some pretty interesting events and there are opportunities for you to get involved to put forward your own idea of fun ideas.",

    "postText": "Hii all! I am a high school student right now and am applying to college at the end of this year. \n\nI have always been interested in quantitative finance and saw that CMU (which I absolutely love) offers a bachelor of science in computational finance. But from the website and what I read, are you only able to apply for it in sophomore? Does that mean that when I am applying for CMU on common app, I can't pick BSCF as my major, and can only choose another major in MCS or Tepper School before transferring to BSCF? (and bcs of this I can't be guaranteed a spot in BSCF even after I get into CMU using another major?)\n\nThanks in advance!",

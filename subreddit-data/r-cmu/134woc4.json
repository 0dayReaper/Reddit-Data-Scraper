    "postText": "The issue about CMU that I see for most of my student peers is that the work is not something that they take pleasure from, but rather a means to some unclear but lucrative career in the future. I'd like to see CMU students lean in to what they truly enjoy deep inside, instead of following a path that is likely to lead to either #1) some form of displeasure/wasted time in the future after being stuck in a place that isn't aligned with their interests, or #2) the extinguishing of the desire to follow what they really want amidst the pressures of conformity/stability in the post-grad world. If you don't know what you like, intentionally try to figure it out while you can in college. Post definitely doesn't apply to everyone, but some people probably need to hear this\n\nEdit: Honestly super glad that this sparked some discussion, and it was interesting to see the varied responses. Definitely a subjective topic, but didn't expect this to be such a controversial take \u2014 the goal of the post was to just put into words a few observations I've seen and potentially suggest an alternative to those who feel like they're in that uncertain spot.",

I definitely did not mean it in the way you described, and I respectfully think you jumped on a few conclusions a little early. I guess an area that I could clarify is that in my observation, there are people who absolutely have the means to pursue their own thing, but choose not to out of conformity or external pressures which ultimately inhibit their internal desires for something else. Even worse, become too full of themselves due to their income and title and judging others solely by those qualities (but that\u2019s another conversation). Again, from the beginning I mentioned that this opinion doesn\u2019t apply to everyone",

In fact, I think you're currently replying to someone who hasn't even started their CMU undergrad yet. It's ok to cut them some slack for being naive or ignorant, imo. They don't know what things are like elsewhere because they've generally lived life cushioned by their parents and/or their governments (and I wouldn't wish anyone this kind of stress anyway). Plus, they don't have much power to change anything right now. They will hopefully become more empathetic once they understand what it means to be the breadwinner of a family.\n\nBetter for your mental health and heart rate to let dumb comments pass by. :) If you have finals, good luck on finals! Otherwise, good luck on your next paper deadline. I'm going back to working on mine. :P",

            "comment": "Sure I see the point you are trting to make, but it depends on the individual. As an academic, I can say that passion is almost overrated. It is simply a way to get people to work for less and their work probably not amounting to anything and if so just some credit. I can't really say a lot about industry but the 1% of successes you see with startups whose CEO's proclaim passion as a metric or necessity for success don't represent the entirety whereby the remaining 99% failed despite being equally passionate. At some point the world works on connections and even just pure luck which is completely out of one's control.Look at the ROI in expectation im that case, isnt it just equal to an average person's daily salary(assuming CS grads). In such an uncertain world, the only certainty people can have is to work for someone and get a job and I guess once people have responsibilities, it is ludicrous to follow ones passion even if the net reward in expectation is probably just the same monetarily. And I guess if your argument is probably following passion leads tohappiness, then there are other things people do that make them happy for instance being able to provide for their loved ones. So yeah it's really just person specific and you really can't fault them for not thinking the way you want them to think because you think in that particular manner. What you should see this as an opportunity to make connections to people who using their expected stability in the future, can pull you out of miserable situations if you do happen to face them.",

    "postText": "A decent number of people don't seem to be aware that you can just look up the compensation of the president / provost / etc. from IRS Form 990 filings. For example, the president obtained $723,599 in 2018 -&gt; $1,099,141 in 2019 -&gt; $1,314,892 in 2020.\n\nProPublica is a particularly nice website for skimming Form 990s, though I recommend reading one of them in full sometime if you have never done so. This can provide additional context with regards to raises in tuition or lack of raises in professor/staff/grad student salaries. Unfortunately, the IRS is behind on releasing 2021 and 2022 filings, but you can get a general sense from the 2020 filing + I suppose you could always just ask CMU since it's public information that will be released eventually anyway.\n\nYou can look up a lot of non-profits! (e.g., UPMC) Thought this information might make for more interesting dinner conversations than your generic \"yeah another tuition raise\".\n\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/250969449\n\nEdit: if you're reading this post, note that most of it has been hijacked by \"arguments\" with a particularly obtuse individual. I would suggest that you ignore most of the bickering and read [0] instead to get a sense of what the exec have accomplished as well (which you'd already know if you've been reading your emails; the arguments put forth in this thread are just so awfully poor that the exec look much worse than they should. So it's worth reminding people what they've accomplished -- it isn't nothing). Personally, I'm somewhat fond of the Singaporean system of paying politicians -- it's fine to have astronomical paychecks if you can deliver results that justify them. I was hoping this thread would have more people discussing what we think of the results so far, but it got sidetracked and will probably not recover.\n\n[0] https://old.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/10rkl7k/psa_you_can_look_up_cmu_exec_compensation_on/j705uss/",

Combined with the public [list of the top brass / trustees](https://www.cmu.edu/leadership/board/index.html) (as well as third party sites to get more legal intel on them), information like this can help make the case in determining who actually benefits more from the yearly increase in tuition, in comparison to inflation or other costs as well as those major endowments. It may be a prestigious institution but it's also a non-profit so our appointed leaders shouldn't be here to become millionaires, not when I've seen the poor conditions of some of the buildings on campus in my days as an archie student.\n\nJust don't be surprised if you get push back from the brass should you pursue this rabbit hole of finances. As a shuffle survivor, I can tell you some in administrative roles may be more about preserving their gilded image rather than properly dealing with the dross beneath it.  But it's your right to explore these things and make a stand regarding the sheer tuition costs.",

What roles in stugov or committees have you worked? In my experience and in the experience of others, we have lots of _support_ as long as it costs absolutely nothing, so for the most part, we achieve practically nothing.\n\nEdit 2: I should note that we have some professors who are stepping up by offering their _personal funds_ towards such initiatives, when they make a fraction of what the exec makes.",

I could also argue they already are the for profit left overs because they are paying them ten times less.  It\u2019s sort of an appeal to ignorance fallacy.

(though yes, in practice, quite a few are really real estate or investment agencies with an education side business -- for example, MITIMCo president was given 2x the MIT president's compensation back in 2020)\n\nTherefore, if the executives want to demand high compensation, they should bring in enough value that everyone else clearly recognizes that they are the upper percentile of execs. It's absurd that there's been constant top-down penny-pinching directives while they seem to be the only people getting significant pay rises (academic committees are almost exclusively run on free labor, and CMU is no exception). It's absurd that professors make less than new CS grads. There's a huge service and prestige component to being in academia -- why should the execs be any different? Did CMU become a world-class university through the efforts of the execs alone? How many undergrads apply to CMU thinking \"these execs are awesome\"? Personally, I came here for the academics, not the administration.\n\nNote that back in 2000, the president was only making 400k (9x the median household income, assistant professors made about 68k, tuition was 22k) as opposed to 2020's 1.3m (19x the median household income, assistant professors made about 100k, tuition was 57k). 2.5x increase in tuition, with a 3.25x increase for the exec and 1.47x increase for the profs (note also that the starting points of these numbers are not the same). Does that seem right to you?\n\nAnd the president is only one role, of course -- nothing against him personally. There are other roles where you're wondering whether you're really getting what you pay for.\n\n(note: I do have slight personal misgivings about people who are comfortable earning over ~10x the median household income)\n\nEdit: fixed more wonky math (thanks for the DM!), doesn't change the overall argument much.",

Yes.\n\n:)\n\n(If you're not in academia, you may not have known (and had no opportunity or reason to discover) that many professors do a **significant** amount of fundraising of their own. The execs are not especially unique in this regard, except it seems that they mostly bring in new buildings whereas professors cover everyone's day-to-day. I'm mostly bristling at the idea that professors don't seem to be getting their share of increases, to your point, eventually students will decide to not come here if it gets too expensive.)",

Do you really think the university doesn\u2019t have an obligation to stop actively exploiting students unless it\u2019s disallowed by the law? \n\nAlso if all the money coming into CMU is from donations and grants, why is tuition so fucking expensive LMAO",

While some of them would have probably donated regardless of whoever was president, some of the fundraising efforts are truly worth being proud of. For example, Mastercard gave CMU Africa 175m in perpetuity. Lots of smaller 10m to 15m gifts. It's worth reading about those. https://makepossible.cmu.edu/\n\nI'm not saying that the president deserves more or less off that, or that it negates the fact that professors seem to be chronically underpaid and overworked, or that tuition fee matches or doesn't match inflation, etc. I think people should just know the facts so that they can come to their own conclusion. Which, again, is the point of this post.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nIf anyone has lived or is living in the Albion at Morrow Park apartments, can some of you let me know how it is like there? I'm considering moving in and would like to hear what it's like. \n\nAlso, I'd appreciate if anyone has recommendations for relatively new apartments near CMU with an enclosed garage. (I would like to keep it under 4k a month for a 2 bed 2 baths apartment)\n\nthanks in advance!",

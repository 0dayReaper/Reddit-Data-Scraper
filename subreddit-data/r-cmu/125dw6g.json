    "postText": "My heart isn\u2019t in the work! Over the past few months I\u2019ve been feeling super isolated. Most of my classes are online,  and I\u2019m graduating from grad school here in May and I feel like my social life has taken a big hit. No one that I know does anything remotely fun, and I feel super overworked, stressed and depressed. My weekends just bleed away with me doing homework and I also don\u2019t have a job lined up and this is also severely impacting my mental health as an international student. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt more socially isolated and stressed in my life. I don\u2019t even know what to do\u2026.",

Everyone I\u2019ve meet is genuinely nice and willing to get to know you, and could also be facing the same struggles your having!",

From what I\u2019ve seen most clubs here are catered towards undergrads plus i genuinely don\u2019t have time except on the weekends to socialize since I also work as an RA on the weekdays and since it\u2019s my last few months, all the deadlines are also piling up :(",

Plenty of graduate students join clubs since they move from all over. Just remember to put yourself first, have to keep the triangle happy (social, personal, work)!",

Not to add more to your list, but you may want to consider a program from OIE called [Virtual Neighbors](https://www.cmu.edu/oie/community-connections/programs/host-family-program/index.html) \\- it matches you with a faculty or staff member who will be a friendly contact for you. You can set the parameters of when/if you want to meet in person, they can simply check in on you if that's all you want.  I know some Virtual Neighbors have hosted holiday meals for their students and taken them to various cultural events in the city, and have kept in touch after graduation. But it's up to the student how much involvement they are seeking. \n\nJust a suggestion if you're feeling isolated - it may be nice to have someone you know is in your corner, rooting for you. Good luck.",

You never know what kind of opportunities that'll get you in the future.\n\nYou only have a few more weeks left, then you have the rest of your life to look forward to!",

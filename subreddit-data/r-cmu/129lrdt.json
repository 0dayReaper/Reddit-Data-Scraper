    "postText": "Am coming as an exchange student from CMU-Q this fall, and was looking forward to taking certain data science courses. All the courses i see focus heavily on core theory of ML/AI, and am looking more towards practical Application of data science sorta courses (unless ofc u advise me against it and go full on death wish :))))) )  \n\n\nCurrently i am still undecided between these,\n\n1. 17-428 Machine Learning and Sensing\n2. 95-451 Making Products Count Data Science for Product Managers\n3. 05-434 Machine learning in Practice\n\nI am open to reviews about there/ other suggestions/ bashing me for my choices :)  \n\n\nOh and if it is any help i am an Information Systems Junior focusing mainly on Data Science  \n\n\nAny help is appreciated :))))",

Focuses on practical modeling, not a first principles class. Interesting assignments and projects (supervised learning, NLP). David Steier is an excellent prof!\n\n17-691 also called ML in practice is really useful - I\u2019ve got a lot of experience doing ModelOps but Isaac takes you through MLOps cycle, which I think is a very useful skill that\u2019s not taught a lot. Very real world oriented, where class provides a high level concept overview of data engineering, model engineering, and model serving. [airflow, metaflow, docker, etc]",

There are no live lectures / class meetings, but you can still interact with instructors on Piazza and in office hours.",

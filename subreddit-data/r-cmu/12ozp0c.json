    "postText": "Does anyone know how gender is distributed in each dorm? E.g. gender separated by floor, gender separated by room, etc. I prefer dorms with as much separation as possible (mainly bc I feel safer that way), and I think the least I'll go is separation by floor. I'm female by the way.",

            "comment": "IIRC all dorms are divided out in a way that ensures that each gender has relatively guaranteed private access to relevant bathroom/shower facilities within a given pod. For example, buildings with communal showers will have gender-specific floors (or separate wings of a given floor number, e.g. East/West). \n\nOther dorms with private suites (which have a dedicated bathroom inside the dorm room) can have mixed gender on the same floor and even placed in adjacent rooms.",

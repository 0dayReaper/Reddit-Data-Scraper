            "comment": "You will know if they ask.  The school can\u2019t release your disciplinary info without your permission (or a court order).  So the employer will ask for your permission if they are going to check for disciplinary records.  But note that the permission may be buried in the fine print of the terms for you to consent to other background checks, such as credit checks and criminal history.\n\nBut in my experience, employers mainly want to verify that the degree is legit and you aren\u2019t lying on your resume.  Schools don\u2019t need your consent to verify date of graduation, degree and major.  So employers can check it as part of their normal screening.  Most major companies have third party services that handle these checks.",

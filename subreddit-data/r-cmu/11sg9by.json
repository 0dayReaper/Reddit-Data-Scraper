    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture. After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.\n\nThis particularly controversial tale occurred around the passing of the millennium, and unlike the other occasional noted lore passed down from before my time (such as the [studio goat](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/n7f4nf/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_1_the_legend_of/) and [steam tunnel kid](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/n7f60a/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_3_the_steam_punk/)), this oft-repeated true story can be backed up with actual documentation found on the internet. Consider it a highly cautionary tale worth remembering, lest history repeats itself, as one professor said when retelling the infamous story to fifth years.\n\nThere used to be a time when archie undergraduates could present almost any subject matter for a final thesis endeavor. That project could be simply a self-designed personal house with a complete set of drawings and renders. Sometimes, it would be a conceptual hypothesis explored, dissected and reconstructed into a full-fledged theorem backed by painstaking research. I still remember a few sustainable endeavors such as the heated extruder that cranked out plastic hotdogs by the foot as building materials and the ambitious proposal to install non-invasive solar passive comfort systems within studio. You never knew exactly what the students would present but their honest intentions were always interesting and reflective observations of real-world concerns.\n\nOne student long ago walked down the monumental colonnades on campus and was somehow inspired with a dreadful proposition. He apparently saw similarities with campus classical architecture and the pompous style implemented by the national socialists that had plunged Europe into the Second World War. He set about to prove a relationship between the two.\n\nNormally, this would not be cause for concern. Famous dictators and their followers have been included in such studies before, their influences on architecture presented as part of pinup studies of history. However, the student went one step further to \u201cprove\u201d his point. On the night of his presentation, he projected films of those infamous marches and speeches on the side of the then newly built University Center for all to see and compare with their campus architecture.\n\nIf ever things went from bad to worse, he could have not picked a worst night to do his thesis exhibition. Driving home from a special holiday dinner were scores of believers whose families experienced countless horrors inflicted upon them by that dictator projected on the side of the building. As they passed the campus, they saw with their own eyes the familiar face which incited unlimited rage at the university.\n\nThe following morning and for days after, campus phones must have been ringing nonstop with irate local citizens and angry benefactors threatening to withdraw their funding to the institution. The local news got a hold of the story and nothing could keep it from going viral. Damage control was desperately needed lest the entire university would forever lose its gilded image and its funding.\n\nAs the ones who let this exhibit happen, the culpable architecture department turned to one man to save them all, a notably loquacious professor who might not be able to write a single point in under a hundred words to save his own life. Regardless of his verbose inclination, he was a historian well-studied in the many theories and movements related to architecture. He, and his team of fellow professors tasked with the response, submitted to the local newspaper a long article stating a few key points, which can be condensed to spare anyone a good thirty minutes of reading:\n\n1. The university did not endorse the projected images in any way shape or form.\n2. The student had the freedom of speech to express his views for his thesis project.\n3. Campus and national socialist architectures have roots in the classical style but they were developed in different times and for different reasons. It would not be right to judge an older, established style because of a more recent interpretation by an infamous movement that committed countless crimes against humanity.\n\nWhether or not everyone agrees with these assertions, such was the professors\u2019 monologue in defense of the institution and classically-inspired campus architecture in general. As far as I know, the student was not affected by any consequences for his thesis project. The university apparently suffered no known major loss of donations for it has continued to grow since then. Whatever shock it may have had when it happened is now largely forgotten outside of the architecture program, which still uses this true tale today as the main reason why thesis projects have a much more stringent approval process. In memory of everyone\u2019s old relations who lost everything during those terrible times, may history never again repeat that darkest chapter.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d",

AND CANCELLATION ISN\u2019T ALLOWED??? This is actually just robbery\n\nI feel like cmu built too many dorms and is now using a policy change to lock students into paying crazy rates for shitty moldy rooms",

They also bought residence on fifth, fifth Neville apartments and started using more of Fairfax.  In those twenty years student body has grown 50% and it has also driven up rent all over the area.  That\u2019s 500 new beds for 5000 new students.\n\nThey tore down the old Doherty apartments.  Those were awful.  Three people to a tiny room.  The new building is much better with half the rooms singles. Donner is scheduled to be replaced also.\n\nRents around campus\n\nhttps://www.apartments.com/amberson-gardens-pittsburgh-pa/w2vgfbj/\n\nhttps://www.apartments.com/walnut-on-wightman-pittsburgh-pa/cktm3zd/\n\nI lived in the walnut on Wightman in 2010 and it was $2100 then and now it\u2019s $3800.  Usually had to walk home because the buses were always full by time they reached campus",

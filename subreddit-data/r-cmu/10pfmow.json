            "comment": "I took CV last semester and haven\u2019t taken NLP, here\u2019s my two cents: CV as it was taught by O\u2019toole was far more of a computational photography (camera physics/ intrinsic, graphics) course than the DL stuff I thought it\u2019d cover. It was a good and tough class nonetheless, lectures were great and assignments were challenging. From what I understand, NLP is overall less polished (marginally poorer instruction/assignments) but it is exactly what one expects of an intro NLP class, and is a good toolbox of older/newer concepts.\n\nGiven that I\u2019m far more into NLP, I probably should have ignored the slightly low reviews of lectures from friends and taken 11-411 instead, but your mileage may vary.",

    "postText": "Hi Folks,\n\nI am about to wrap up my MS in Biomedical Engineering this May. I was disappointed with my program and generally had a bad experience, so I wanted to leave a warning for future prospective students here. \n\nPros:\n\n* The degree is very flexible. You can enroll in many courses across the university.\n* The department is very small, which means you will often have smaller class sizes.\n* The field is very interdisciplinary, for better or worse. Your studies focus on breath and not depth.\n\nCons:\n\n* Poor quality coursework. Very few courses offered by the department are as rigorous or comprehensive as those offered in other departments. Most have the flavor \"xxx for BME\" which is a watered-down version of a course offered elsewhere. Examples: Intro to ML for Biomedical Engineers (take intro to ML instead), Neural Signal Processing (take a signal processing course instead), etc.\n* BME courses often have massive grade inflation. I took a course where every student was given an A. This can be frustrating.\n* Poor outcomes. BME graduates get paid roughly 60-80% of those in other College of Engineering programs (\\~80k vs \\~110k). You can check [here](https://www.cmu.edu/career/outcomes/post-grad-dashboard.html). This is likely because of the reasons above.\n* Unpaid research is expected. If you take a \"Research Focused\" degree program you will be expected to perform the work of an RA without compensation. What a scam.\n\nI hope this info helps future students make an informed decision about the program!",

Masters are a business and generally self paid, often by professionals. They want everyone to graduate. My ECE masters was the same. \n\n3) BME is likely underpaid because it lives so much in the intersection of fields. Probably because the niche place that it exists has a bit less demand.",

            "comment": "I graduated from this program a couple years ago, the classes offered by the department are not up to standard and the logistics are kind of messy but I got to do the research I liked and take the courses I wanted. I heard they are less flexible with courses now tho. Imo they just don\u2019t have enough professors to form one department. The courses are way too broad without much depth into it. What made me very mad was that they required you to select some field to focus on but there are not enough courses in each of the fields (at least not enough good ones). Everyone is doing vastly different stuff so if you\u2019re more into research and want to go deeper in that regard, then most of the classes here are not useful at all.",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm looking for someone to sublet my room from 15th May 2023 and potentially take over the lease starting from Aug 2023. If you're looking to take it up between May and July, we can work that out as well!\n\nRent - $650/month \n\nThe room is fully furnished. You'll share a bathroom with 1 person. The kitchen is equipped so you'd just have to move in with your stuff. And you don't pay for the laundry! \n\nThe utilities including gas, water, electricity and wifi are usually approximately $80/month. \n\nIdeal for CMU students. You can take 61A/B/C/D and 67,69 to CMU and takes about 7-8mins. \n\nPS - Looking for female roommates only.\n\nShoot me a DM if you're interested :)",

            "comment": "Not a CMU grad student but have some insight from my undergrad time\n\n- Make use of Pittsburgh\u2019s bus system, which you\u2019ll get free access to with your student ID. If you\u2019re committed enough you can get almost anywhere in the city using it\n\n- CMU gives you free access to a bunch of museums, so take advantage of that (should be a listing somewhere?) Phipps is a popular local choice.\n\n- Pittsburgh also has a bunch of other great opportunities - I love going down to the Point tbh. Can also go kayaking on the rivers or head out to kennywood for amusement park rides\n\n- If you\u2019re into baseball, pirates games are very inexpensive (the Pirates kinda suck unfortunately but the ballpark has an amazing view of the city and they\u2019ll play every other team at home at least once this year so pick your favorite non-Pittsburgh team if you want)\n\n- Penguins tickets with student rush can also be decently affordable, though you might be up in the nosebleeds\n\n- Coffee shops (incomplete list of locations): Gates building, Wean, CUC, CFA, Hunt Library? Definitely missing some if current students want to add on. If you\u2019re in the Mellon Institute you might be out of luck, though craig street isn\u2019t too terribly far away",

It\u2019s colder here in the winter than I expected so bring good winter clothes  it\u2019s not awful but you want to be sure to have a good coat, gloves and hat and boots.  The shadyside and Squirrel Hill neighborhoods are very nice and close to campus. A surprising nice place is the Carnegie Art and Natural Science museum. Interesting that they put both the art and dinosaurs together in one museum but it is good for variety. It is right next to campus and has one of the best dinosaur collections I have ever seen.",

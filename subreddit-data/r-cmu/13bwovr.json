But I only took 122 and the stats in the summer and after checking the summer courses they offer I don't know if there is another easy A class. But I would recommend to you during the semester to take 76-270 (Writing for Profession) and 05391 (Interaction Design Overview). These two are pretty chill and easy to get an A. I am not sure if you are interested in HCI, but I know Service Design is offered this summer, have not taken it yet but I heard as long as you follow the requirements of the assignment you will end up with an A.",

The 122 course in the summer are usually taught by the grad students and they have a lot of OH that you can reach out to for help. What I did when I took it was sitting in the OH to complete my hw so it was easy to get help and concentrate. For the stats, you have a total of three stats reports, some lab assignments, and around 8 hw (these are all done using R) and I would recommend you find a group of friends to study and do hw together (I remember they allow collaboration on the lab assignments and the hw as long as you include your friends' Andrew id on your work). The professor is very nice so ask him if you are stuck. Go to every lecture and you will understand most of the materials for the exams (exams are multiple choice and some need you to do simple calculations).",

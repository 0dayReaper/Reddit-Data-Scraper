I'll probably join regardless of the answer to this question, but I was wondering if y'all (especially grad students) feel any connection/pride in attending CMU?\n\nI'm coming from a university in South-East Asia, but due to the size of the school and my limited involvement in extra-curriculars, I don't feel as strong of a connection to my school as I should. I was wondering how y'all feel about coming from CMU, thanks!",

The belongingness doesn't have to be from extracurricular, but it does help. Doing a group project or finding an organization that fits your interest (within CMU or just in the city of Pittsburgh in general) can be a gateway to friends and colleagues.  \n\n\nEDIT any questions that are SE Asians related ?",

For example, I don't think you can find bak chor mee or nasi lemak around here. The closest thing is https://www.spiceislandteahouse.com/ having char kway teow. In general, food prices in the US have gotten a little crazy -- especially compared to hawker centers back in SG -- so be ready to pay $10-30 per meal, or cook.\n\nWelcome to CMU!",

            "comment": "The MSCS program is a fast three semesters (optional fourth for Foundational Studies), so how connected you feel to CMU will depend on how you use your time here, especially outside of coursework. My advice is (1) find something to get you out of Gates unless you want that building to be your only memory of CMU. Play recreational sports (basketball and squash are good year-round, tennis is good for about half of the year) or join clubs. On the academic side, \"connection/pride\" with CMU for me came from getting involved with research. As such, my other advice is (2) find a topic area you're interested in and start crashing seminars or research meetings. Do an independent study for a semester. Don't spend all of your time on coursework, and have some conversations with smart people about something you're interested in. You'll make more genuine connections that way than just sitting in lectures and silently submitting assignments to Autolab/Gradescope/Canvas.",

Obviously I\u2019m very proud of the program and grateful for the opportunity, and we\u2019re constantly publishing papers and innovating (we\u2019re sending robots to space like it\u2019s no biggie). I enjoy the extracurriculares I\u2019m in and have found belonging in that sense. But I do get imposter syndrome, specifically in the SCS. There are so many people here that are just simply smarter and more efficient. It\u2019s demoralizing and makes me feel like I \u201cdon\u2019t belong\u201d sometimes. But it can also be encouraging and motivating to be around such aspiring people, which makes me want to perform better, and I remember that these are some of the best of the best \u2014 comparing myself to them is like comparing to the 0.01%, which is unfair to me.\n\n\nSo yeah, I have lots of school pride, but the occasional imposter syndrome :) I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t have to worry about that much given that you made it into the MSCS.",

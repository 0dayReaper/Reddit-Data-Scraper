Everytime I get met with this message in the screenshot below...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hs7htwj18zsa1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bd449bed89502da305c325b30148683d8cf88ad8\n\nI've tried using an incognito tab, using my phone, using a different web browser and it was all to no avail. What's more is I'm able to log into my andrewid email and housing sign ups account so I'm pretty sure it's just HealthConnect that's the problem.\n\nI've emailed the department about this already and I'm waiting for a response, but I was just wondering if anyone with this same exact problem has found a solution! I'll update once I find one as well.\n\n**Edit:** I just received a reply. We can't sign in until mid May!!! If you can't login it's perfectly fine :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r5yzjpvgu4ta1.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=95bb2d060cc5641ba5a16a36ed6cc86c20922f35\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

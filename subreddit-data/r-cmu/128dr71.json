Not sure what is your majors planning but usually people don\u2019t have to do all this during summer?\n\nRemember that you just need to complete the path you\u2019ve set in stellic, no need to do extra",

Otherwise, you'll probably struggle a bit, depends on how good you feel with programming in general. If you've already taken 36225, 36226 (stat inf) basically picks up from the end of 225. So however you did at the end of 225 is likely how well you'll do in the entirety of 226, though many say that 226 is harder (it depends on how easy your 225 prof was, mine was pretty difficult at the end so 226 felt pretty much the same)",

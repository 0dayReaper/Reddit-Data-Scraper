Yours might already be answered!\n\nPlease consider posting to subs like /r/pittsburgh for general life in Pittsburgh questions, dedicated subs like /r/chanceme, /r/ApplyingToCollege, and /r/collegeresults for odds of getting accepted, and using the search in the sidebar.\n\n^(If I've misidentified your post, please ignore this message and instead take it as a reminder to contribute your own answers to the megathread.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Due to this, the university wants to accept people off the waitlist that are for sure going to accept. They tend to look for what they are missing (example: not enough minorities from the west coast, then they will be more inclined to choose a minority from the west coast). But telling them you are happy that you have a chance and that you\u2019re still very inclined to go to CMU if they give you an offer. That could boost your chance even if it\u2019s minimal. (There was a YouTube video of an admission lady who said this, I\u2019ll link it if I find it )",

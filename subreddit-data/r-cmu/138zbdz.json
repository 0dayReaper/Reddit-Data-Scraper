    "postText": "Hi, I am planning to take 15122 and 21241 during summer 2. I assume I have to spend most of the time in 15122 as the course is supposed to be more intense during the summer which might leave less time to work on 21241. I personally struggled with 21127 proofs for which I am a bit apprehensive about 21241. I heard the difficulty of 21241 depends on the instructor. Irina will be teaching 21241 during summer 2. Can anyone share some insights about the difficulty level of Irina\u2019s 21241? How can I prepare myself from now if I want to stick with 21241? I am also open to register for a comparatively easier course instead of 21241 as I want to focus more on 15122.",

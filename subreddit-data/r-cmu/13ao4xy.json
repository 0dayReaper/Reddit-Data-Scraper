    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nHope your finals are going well! As we near the end of the year, ACM@CMU is looking for organizers to join our team for the upcoming 2023-2024 school year.\n\nACM@CMU, Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery, is the premier organization for computing professionals. Our mission is to provide opportunities in interdisciplinary computing for our students as well as drive forward their professional development on campus.\n\nIf you attended our events and enjoyed them or would just like to help out, we'd love for you to join us!   Organizing can be done async and remote over the summer as we prepare for HackCMU early in the semester.\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask! And to any alumni interested in making a connection or collaborating, we'd love to talk :)\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaKFBweo8JkEPZa8uqmZVFpM5EUP1QMH6fuEwyh8Md5rNwLg/viewform ",

    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture. After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.\n\nFor archies, there is nothing more terrifying in woodshop than triggering the brake on the table saw. One wrong move or wrong material and that sensor would activate in milliseconds, ideally to save the user\u2019s precious fingers from irreversible injury. More often than not, the sensor was triggered by mistake, as archies sometimes forgot to deactivate it before cutting aluminum sheets or accidentally skewing the board into an odd angle for the blade. Indeed, it was a temperamental safety feature that was only appreciated when it actually saved digits. The rest of the time, it produced unfathomable levels of agony and dread because of the incurred penalty to pay for a new saw brake. One such winter morning, a student working for the school between semesters for much-needed cash found himself in that same predicament the moment he turned on the table saw.\n\nInstead of the usual roar, there was a sudden thud then perfect quiet. Recognizing the ominous sign of a sunken sawblade, the kid opened up the table shield to find the brake had mysteriously activated and shredded itself against the blade. That would be a hefty fine to replace the brake, perhaps more if the carbide-tipped blade was damaged.\n\n   At first, the woodshop director was inclined to the normal routine of charging the student. Even if working for the school, such mistakes were lessons that students had to learn on their dime. However, the kid had discovered evidence absolving himself. After disclosing all he did was turn on the table saw, he let the director peer into the blade chamber under the table top. As the dim rays of the fluorescent lights overhead made their way into that steely cavern, a fine layer of aluminum dust could be seen glittering from the darkest recesses. \n\nIt was a curious mystery, for a moment or two. The director\u2019s face lit up as soon as he recalled who had used the table saw the previous afternoon before closing: the digital media instructor.\n\n   Yes, the nerdy-voiced ghostly pale teacher-turned-studio-coordinator who was rarely seen outside of the Maggie Mo basement had previously ventured into woodshop to cut some aluminum track for his project. At the end of the day during the usual cleanup routine, he must have neglected to vacuum inside the table saw. When the kid turned it on the next morning to cut plywood shelving, the aluminum dust kicked up and made contact with the electrified blade, setting off the infamous brake.\n\nOff like a flash, the woodshop director went to his office in the back to grab the form necessary to charge the instructor for the damage. Relieved to be off the hook, the kid happily carried it through the piles of snow to deliver it while the director changed the brake and blade. When presented with the bill, the surprised digital media instructor let out a small chuckle. He whipped out a notecard from his desk and entered the necessary code on the form for the school\u2019s own charge account to pay for his blunder. In his defense, it was metal being cut for a project funded by the school. After all, students had to pay for their mistakes but Heaven forbid if a professor ever had to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d",

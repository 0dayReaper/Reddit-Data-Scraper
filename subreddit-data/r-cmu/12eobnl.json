My interview was more about pedagogy and the kind of projects I did beyond client appointments. Also, my \"training\" was more self directed and I got to start immediately. The six-week practicum was waived for me because of my experience. \n\nYou'll likely be asked about related experience with helping others with writing or putting together presentations. Because CMU has a large international student population, they'll want to know if you have any second language experience. We offer speaking appointments and conversation groups for those who want extra practice speaking English (we also approach this topic from a de-colonial perspective). The basis self-motivation, time management and dealing with challenge, will likely be asked as well.\n\nYou are only assigned 5 hours a week but can sometimes pick up more if someone needs their shift covered (happens most often around holidays, midterms and finals).",

I did go through the job descriptions and from my understanding, a lot of it has to do with that of a writing coach. I do have some experience in that. Are those clients mostly international students who need help with their English?",

The goal is always about helping the client put their ideas together coherently and with regard to genre conventions. If you have a chance, you can look at the numerous [CLS Handouts](https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/other-resources/handouts/index.html) we offer. Fun fact: when I applied to CMU, I used their personal statement handout! Needless to say, it worked!\n\nThe english language practice is an optional training module you can take to provide those appointment types in addition to the writing centric ones. Some consultants only do writing, some only do speaking, and some of us do both!\n\nThe speaking appointments are very popular and we always have waiting lists to join the conversation groups--I highly recommend tackling that training if you think it's something you would enjoy. Personally, I only hold the conversation group and have my bookable appointments as writing only. This gives me a predictable balance and minimizes burnout. \n\nI will say that the job can be very l lonely :( After training, consultants generally work by themselves (and many opt to hold their appointments online instead of in person--I prefer in person because of my learning style, but zoom option has come in handy when I had mild Covid last Fall.) It's by no means fast-paced.",

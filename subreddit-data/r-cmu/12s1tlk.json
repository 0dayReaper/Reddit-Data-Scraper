To do this, we are providing free live apartment video tours for incoming CMU students. If you send us an apartment, we will schedule an in person tour and then video call you as we do the tour.\nIf you are at all interested or have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out (really please reach out, we want to help as many people as possible and it distracts me from coding all day long) \nThank you! \nanesathu@andrew.cmu.edu\u00a0|\u00a0781-999-5514",

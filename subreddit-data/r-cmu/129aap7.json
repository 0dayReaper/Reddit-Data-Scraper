    "postText": "Hi guys, \nI got admitted to the MS program for ECE at CMU. Looking at the fees structure, it is hella expensive. I was wondering, if there's a fee waiver opportunity or some scholarship opportunities at CMU's college of engineering? Do people here get any fee waiver or scholarship who have TA and RA opportunities ? I am an international student and would like to know, if there's an option to get the funding right.",

            "comment": "Very few professors offer funding in the form of tuition waivers for any of the MS programs. I believe MSR/MLT are the only exceptions where most students get funding.\nTA/RA pay is hourly, and covers living expenses (at best).\nSo you're pretty much reliant on either being rich or taking a student loan.",

You can check the outcomes here: https://www.cmu.edu/career/outcomes/post-grad-dashboard.html\n\nMy 2c: research the possible career paths in the department (silicon, AI, etc.) and select BEFORE you enroll. That will maximize your outcomes. In other words: make a plan and find the courses, professors, students,  etc. who can help you make that plan a reality.",

But since you asked about downsides: you might have less of a \"cohort\" as fewer students will be starting at that time. Depending on when you graduate (3 semesters or 4 semesters) you may have to plan well to sync up with companies recruiting seasons. It might be a little hard to plan for a PhD if you are intersted in that route. That's all I can think of! There might be upsides as well. Good luck!",

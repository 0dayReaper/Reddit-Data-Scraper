    "postText": "\nHi guys, need some help. I got admits for my Masters from both Harvard Data Science and CMU MS CV. I wanted to know which program I should consider and why?\n\nI would be an International student. I have a mix background in Computer Science and Biology. I would have 1 year of work experience before joining as a research engineer (in computer vision).\n\nI am not into PhD after Masters and would like to work as a research engineer/scientist in Industry.\n\nI have worked at Harvard for about a year and made some good connections there and in the rest of Boston and I liked living in Cambridge/Boston. 0 living experience of Pittsburgh.\n\nI know Boston is costly and Pittsburgh is less expensive, but I want to know other reasons apart from this.(I believe in the long run this won't matter hence need other reasons).\n\nOne of the main point of confusion: CMU is at the top ranking wise in CS or ML/AI but the general brand name that Harvard has along with the ability to cross register at MIT!",

            "comment": "Depends on what you want. If you want to be a data scientist and get a chance to be an ML engineer, go Harvard. If you want to be either an ML/AI engineer in the CV space, robotics SWE, or an AR/VR/CV SWE, go CMU. Harvard has a brand, but CMU does, too. You can't go wrong with both, but CMU opens you to a ridiculous high paying specialized SWE path, while Harvard has you set on a more ML or data science path.",

I personally would not recommend taking a 100k loan _unless_ you will do anything to stay and work in the US afterwards, it will be very difficult to pay off that kind of money outside of the US.\n\nThis is indeed the story of many others. I know a lot of people who are/were much more talented _and_ more hard-working than me who didn't go to college for cost reasons.",

That plus covid forced me to drop out.  It was either that or a bunch of loans. Its not worth it to me if I spend the rest of my career paying off debts, especially since I just wanna teach. I think you should go with your gut on this one. If your career path is lucrative it wouldnt take long to pay off considering how valuable a CMU degree is. This all doesn\u2019t really help but im just sharing my perspective. Best of luck to you and your future endeavors.",

Just fyi, some masters and all PhD programs have $0 tuition and actually pay a decent stipend.\n\nI do agree that even to think about studying in a different country you typically need to have rich parents (rich to pay for at least a one way ticket, other incidental costs). Even then, there are students who come from absolutely dirt poor backgrounds and miraculously make it to CMU. They are extremely rare, but they exist.",

It\u2019s common to have research masters/Ph.D. students from humble backgrounds, because all they need is enough money for a one way ticket. However, depending on the source country that might be a luxury too. For example, the ability to afford a one way ticket to the US will put you above 90% of the population of Pakistan/India/Nigeria. \n\nIt\u2019s extremely rare to find people who basically come from nothing (but they exist!).",

There's no good solution to their immediate problem, and it can be pretty frustrating to be in their situation. It would suck less if you knew the opportunity difference was down to talent, but for many programs the difference is really down to money (and not even your money at that).",

Unfortunately, the people for whom it sucks the most are super talented folks who cannot even afford a computer, let alone be on Reddit. I feel helpless thinking about such folks often, and I'm not sure if things are are getting better. When I was talking about miracles, I had such stories in mind; those who came from absolutely nothing and still made it to CMU (with many assists from luck).\n\n*\u201cI am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein\u2019s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops.\u201d*  \n*\u2015 Stephen Jay Gould*",

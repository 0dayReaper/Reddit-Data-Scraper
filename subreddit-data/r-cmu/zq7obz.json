    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the CMU School of Architecture. As a  survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their  institution's past.  You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you  the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.\n\nMany an architecture student might wonder what exactly happens to their models, drawings, supplies, and knickknacks left behind between spring and fall semesters. Sure, they are removed from studio as the infamously short tempered facilities manager always warned students during final exam week, but the stuff did not always go straight to the landfill.\n\nSalvageable materials such as wood, vellum, and mechanical pencils were typically gathered onto a table for archi camp to use with high school students. Forgotten USB drives and CDs were handed over to the tech guru, who reused them for various computer work. Miscellaneous items from leather purses and jewelry to expensive clothes were placed on a table as a makeshift \u201clost and found\u201d station, before finally being thrown into the trash. Library books likewise found themselves in a communal pile until finally returned back to the library after students called the office to complain of late fees on their accounts.\n\nOf course, preceding all these secondary allotments is the primary rule: \u201cfinders keepers.\u201d Soarch students paid to clear out studio were naturally allowed to keep materials and other things they wished to use themselves. Doing so often saved themselves thousands of dollars in future projects. When Soarch staff, accustomed to sitting in their chilled offices all day, started cracking down on this old rule and insisted anything and everything useful be given to them, the hardworking and overheated students got clever in hiding their little hoards and snuck them out at the end of the work day. In fact, the [fabled student-ran secret store room](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/n7f71d/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_5_the_room_of/) was well-stocked many summers by this practice. Students kept the finer basswood and gave Soarch staff the detested cheap balsa wood for their archi camp. They wouldn\u2019t know the difference and the school could certainly afford better if they did. The tech guru received a few found 2gb flash drives while the cleanup crew held onto the better stuff. Thus the students continued their salvaging enterprise but the remaining unclaimed architecture models found no such love in their eyes.\n\nArmed with big sticks and all the time in the world to get studio cleaned up in time for the fall semester, a group of three students once found some time for a sporty diversion. The two ladies took turns at a make shift plate while the dude grabbed a decent sized model. He wound up the pitch and threw a slugger. On the moment of contact with their bat, the models exploded into thousands of pieces like the famous Death Star every time. The shrapnel would shoot back at the pitcher and he would have to cover his face from the onslaught of broken basswood pieces, stray plexi, and cardboard that ended up littering the entire floor behind him. One model after another met its fate that day until none were left in studio. A few sweeps of the broom and the Soarch facilities manager was none the wiser about their underground summer baseball program, no matter how many times she stopped by to check the cause of their laughter.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d",

    "postText": "\nJust for some context, I am a Quant Developer working at JPMorgan for some time. I applied to a bunch of universities for Data Science and Computational Finance.  My top 4 picks from where I got an admit are Columbia MSDS, NYU MSDS , CMU MSCF, UWashington MSDS. I need some guidance and help deciding. I do like quantitative finance, but I dont want to restrict myself to finance industry forever. I would want an option to maybe work for product based companies and in core technology. I am getting confused between the IVY tag and CMUs awesome curriculum. Any guidance would be really appreciated.\nI have 15k$ scholarship from CMU which means the total tuition would be 75k, whereas I didn\u2019t get any scholarship from Columbia, but their tuition itself is close to 75k. Both programs are 1.5 years, and very competitive. I am glad to have this confusion to decide between the two, cuz its quite rare.",

            "comment": "I'd do UW or CMU. NYU and Columbia are good schools, but UW and CMU's CS programs are definitely ahead of them, especially in ML/DS.\n\nSomething to also keep in mind is the cost of living in those cities and the quality of life. I currently live in Seattle but visited Pittsburgh three weeks ago and I can confidently say that prices in PGH are far more reasonable, at least as far as rent and food goes. I know some might argue that Seattle has more to do than Pittsburgh (hate to say it, but it's true) but if it's just for 1.5 years it really doesn't matter; you'll be drowning in work so I don't think you'll get out all too much.",

            "comment": "CMU - if you don't mind the heavy course load. My understanding is that the vast majority of Columbia's MS programs are cash cows. Although I understand that MSDS is not one of them, the employers may not think that way.\n\nThe MSCF is way more selective and CMU provides better networking resources than Columbia.",

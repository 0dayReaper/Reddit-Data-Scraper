Most TAs at this school are severely underpaid, especially in the cs department. It honestly it sucks, most TAs are being exploited by the school.",

Thus only people who want to do it (either for Resume or want to) will do so for the experience and thus will do a very good job. And if this eliminates the possibility of some good students being able to afford TAing that's a cost they are willing to take.",

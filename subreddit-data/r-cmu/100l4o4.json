As soon as that shift starts to happen\n\nI don't really know what you're taking offense at, nowhere in any of those three bullets did I say \"CMU sucks because we don't emphasize sports any more\". My core point was that ~90 years ago we were just as renowned for our sports as we are for our academics today. Isn't that neat on its own? The team that contested TCU for the national championship, and the team that shut out Notre Dame are notable in history. This factoid was more to highlight the interesting coincidence that CMU has a relationship to something happening in national news today/this week. \n\n&gt; And by athletics, I mean coaches and advertising for the school, but not to the players, because they're not allowed to be paid\n\nAlthough it is still true that players do not get paid salary (i.e. professional employees of the school), there is a new policy that allows students to profit from their name, image, or likeness (NIL). Suppose one of TCU's relatively no-name players manages to snag a Wheaties cereal deal after this upcoming national championship game, then any profits from that are acceptable now. That wasn't the case when you or I were in school. I personally don't think it's enough to justify risking life and limb (esp. considering that only the toppest most popular athletes will be able to consistently take advantage of this policy) but it's better than things used to be.\n\n&gt;  If you want to take pride in your school, take pride in what makes CMU great, rather than in an exploitive system that is \"amateur\" athletics.\n\nAgain, what are you mad about? I do take pride in CMU. I love coming going back to visit old spaces like the Black Chairs or my old residence/dorm. I still keep a correspondence with my academic advisor because I owe that dude my life. I donate time *and* money to our alumni association. If I didn't value the academic pedigree of our school or the time I spent there, I wouldn't do half this stuff. It's from these experiences that I think CMU's student-athletes are really admirable for toughing out all the same academic rigor in the same classes as me, while also putting in amazing work outside the classroom, too.\n\nCMU athletics *today* is pride-worthy. Did you know that the football team made the playoffs for the last two years in a row? Did you know that the (women's) soccer team reached #7 in the nation and was in the Sweet 16 just a month ago? Doesn't stop there, [the volleyball and track-and-field teams are doing great things too](https://athletics.cmu.edu/generalnews/2022-2023/proclamation_cityofpgh). So like, I'm kind of taken aback by your opinion that \"nobody fucking cares\". I think more people should.",

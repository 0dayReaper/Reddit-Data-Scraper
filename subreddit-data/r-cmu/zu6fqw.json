Rarely you may have to work it out with your advisor to get a slot but generally you just sign up and clear the wait list. My process for 11-411 was literally no different than 10-601.\n\nWell, the attendance was quite different. The ML course (back then) was already burgeoning with the industry and was like a 200-300 person lecture. Every single one of Alan's classes were much smaller 15-20 person classrooms and I promise the learning experience was more enriching because of that.",

Almost every class has an undergraduate equivalent with different course numbers (like deep learning was 11-785 and I think the undergraduate one was 11-385).  The class is the same, with the same lectures, just slightly different assignments.",

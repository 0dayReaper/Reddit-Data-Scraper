Expecting a B, is it bad for a grad student to get a B in such a foundational course? \n\nI don't even have an internship for the summer, making me hate myself even more.",

Are you taking anything that has 213 as a prerequisite? For example, if you're going to be taking 15-410 Operating Systems or equivalent, I would suggest making sure you have a very very strong handle on the 213 material.",

But you can't call it until the grade comes back, especially if you have the padding of all the labs and just need a ~63 to get an A. And worst case, even a B will not be bad. Just make sure to study hard for courses that follow 213",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently a high school senior who's been fortunate enough to receive acceptances from both Carnegie Mellon University and Johns Hopkins University. Now, I find myself in the challenging position of deciding between the two. I thought I'd reach out to this community to get some input from people who have firsthand experience at CMU.\n\nMy main academic interests are physics (specifically quantum physics and subatomic physics) and **possibly** computer science (with a focus on AI and quantum computing). Additionally, I have a strong interest in entrepreneurship and hope to potentially start my own company in the future. However, I've participated in research as a high schooler and have genuinely enjoyed that aspect.\n\nHere's how I'm currently seeing the two schools:\n\n**CMU:** Known for its excellent CS program and strong entrepreneurial culture. I know there's a Quantum Computing Group within the Physics Department which could potentially offer opportunities that combine my interests.\n\n**JHU:** Renowned for its research and strong programs in physics, which might provide more specialized knowledge in quantum physics.\n\nBoth schools seem to offer different strengths, and I'm struggling to decide which would be the best fit for my interests and future goals.\n\nIf anyone here has been in a similar situation, has insight into the physics or CS programs at CMU, or has advice on balancing academic interests with entrepreneurial goals, I'd really appreciate your input.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

For instance, many of my friends all across different majors have taken the intro cs class (15-112) and our algorithm and data structures class (15-122). Also, I feel like cs tends to blend into almost all courses at this school.\n\nBasically, if you come here, you'll benefit from some form of cs exposure no matter what.\n\nI would just be wary of the workload if you choose to come here. Being a STEM major at cmu is no joke, and some people struggle under how much work you're expected to do on a weekly basis. Not everybody is happy under these circumstances, but if you're a habitual workaholic (like me Ig, lol), it'll fit you very well.\n\nNot to mention that research is very easy to get into on this campus. There's a huge culture surrounding it here, and its not difficult to look up professor websites and email professors. Many of my friends even got involved spring freshman or early sophomore year.",

You couldn't really do much around the area other than maybe the inner harbor. If you look at the inner harbor area now, it's a a ghost town, I was shocked when I saw some recent YouTube videos of it.\n\n\nMy problems with CMU are essentially all with the bureaucracy, not the students, not the professors, and not the city. I learned a rediculous amount at CMU and for cost of living it's great. That part is important for grad students looking for housing. If you're at a program like Columbia in NYC you will regress to having roommates as a 20-something year old. In Pitt I was able to have a 1 bedroom apartment in grad school which was a game changer for sanity, especially during covid.",

The scary parts of Baltimore are really scary, but the nice parts are really nice, and the Homewood undergraduate campus is in a nice part of the city--Charles Village and Hampden are both really fantastic, with great restaurants and bars, great local ice cream options between Taharka Bros. and the Charmery,  some great local festivals (HonFest, Charles Village Fest, the Mayor's annual Christmas parade, etc.), nice local bookstores, vinyl stores, etc.\n\nInner Harbor area isn't what it used to be to some extent, but the American Visionary Arts Museum is great (and this past weekend was the annual Kinetic Sculpture Race which is always amazing!), the aquarium is fantastic, Camden Yards is a great stadium for baseball or concerts (Paul McCartney last summer was FANTASTIC), etc. It's also pretty inexpensive to get from Baltimore to DC on the MARC commuter train (last I looked it was $9 each way), if one wants to take advantage of the museums and food and theater and concerts there too.\n\nPittsburgh is a wonderful city too, and I look forward to moving there soon. National Aviary, Pirates and Penguins, the zoo, lower cost of living than some peer cities, great restaurants there too, etc. I have no dog in the fight between CMU or JHU, or Pittsburgh v. Baltimore--they both have their charms!\n\nThe advantage I have to give to Baltimore is ease of train travel to other cities up and down the Northeastern Corridor--lots of Amtrak trains each day if you want to hit Boston, New York, Philly, etc.",

            "comment": "I did undergrad at JHU and am a postdoc in CMU robotics institute right now.\n\nI echo most of what has been said in this thread; JHU is not as strong in CS as CMU but is excellent for research, especially in areas of strength like physics and medicine.\n\nKeep in mind that undergrad course content will not vary much from school to school; most of the same things in will be covered in class at JHU and CMU as you would at University of Nowheresville. How well those things are covered...may depend more on the professor than the school. \n\nAnecdotally, even my very very research active professors were engaged and active in teaching undergrads at JHU. I am sure there are some who half ass their teaching, but I didn't encounter any who weren't at least trying to do a good job. That is not something that is guaranteed at schools with strong research, since faculty usually care more about that part of the job. Professors may try to fob off as much of the teaching work on grad and undergrad TAs as they can manage. I do not know if this is a major issue at CMU; I have heard students complain but do not know if it is widespread.\n\nFood and rents were lower in Baltimore than in Pittsburgh, but it's also been a few years so inflation explains some of the difference.\n\nThe other thing you may want to consider is campus culture and extracurricular options, especially if you are interested in starting a business. What fraction of people join greek life? Are there social activities that aren't Greek affiliated? Intramural sports, or musical groups? If the only thing you do on campus is study, you will burn out.",

It's a bit disheartening for someone who loves physics, but it's clear that ML/AI is becoming more prominent in both theoretical and experimental research across all subfields. Modern physics research also requires substantial computing skills.\n  \nAI's influence is somewhat reminiscent of the quantum and relativity era in the early 20th century when physics experienced major breakthroughs. Considering your keen interest in entrepreneurship, I'd strongly recommend CMU over JHU in your case.",

            "comment": "I know very little about JHU (or physics, for that matter), but here are my thoughts on CMU:\n\n\\- as others mentioned, CS is really top notch and it's super easy to get into the classes, even if you are not a CS student. A lot of physics students seem to be at least somewhat interested in CS, but not everyone. There is also a very strong teaching emphasis in the school of computer science (and throughout the university) due to dedicated professors, \"teaching track\" professors (professors who choose to focus exclusively on teaching), and the teaching assistant system (courses tend to be well-staffed with TAs, especially in cs classes, and they are mostly undergrads who have already taken the class they're teaching and done well).\n\n\\- The [Swartz Center](https://www.cmu.edu/swartz-center-for-entrepreneurship/) is the hub for entrepreneurship here. My impression is that we have less entrepreneurially-minded students than, say, Stanford, but it seems to be a big push on campus in the last few years, so there are A LOT of resources available and not that much competition for them. Definitely look into [Innovation Scholars](https://www.cmu.edu/swartz-center-for-entrepreneurship/education-and-resources/innovation-scholars/index.html), which is a cohort program that you would apply to while here (although if you're active in the undergraduate entrepreneurship association and genuinely interested in startups, there is a very good chance you'll be accepted). The UEA also have frequent guest speakers and panels of founders, which are open to anyone.\n\n\\- It is really, really easy to get involved with research while you're here, if that is something that you're interested in. A lot of departments will send around spreadsheets with labs that are looking to take on new students and professors that you email are generally willing to help you find another lab that interests you if they're not currently taking new students. I didn't have any research experience before college, but I found a great lab that completely aligned with my interests in my first year. [SURA](https://www.cmu.edu/uro/summer%20research%20fellowships/sura/index.html) is a great program that makes research very accessible to inexperienced students, but you may be eligible for [SURF](https://www.cmu.edu/uro/summer%20research%20fellowships/SURF/index.html) in your first year, given your research experience. Note that students are not generally allowed to do research in their freshman fall, which is a good thing, imo (you'll have more time to acclimate to CMU and coursework, make friends, etc. before adding that to your plate).\n\n\\- unsolicited but the area around CMU is very safe and friendly to students. We are in a very college-y part of the city (Pitt is literally down the street and there are some other campuses nearby too) and you have the opportunity to interact with other college students through clubs (many will host events in conjunction with their counterparts on other campuses) and cross-enrollment privileges (which are an under-utilized resource, imo). Food and housing in the area also tends to cater toward the student demographic.\n\n\\- if you are thinking of double majoring in physics and cs, I don't think that is doable given the number of courses and lack of course overlap. You could easily do a cs minor with the physics major if that's of interest\n\nFeel free to PM me if you want to chat or have any other questions :)",

            "comment": "One advantage of JHU is that is houses the APL (Advance Physics Lab), probably the most prestigious of the UARCS, which does groundbreaking work in Physics and Systems Engineering (all funded by DoD dollars, but if you are on the academic side of Quantum, thats likely where you funding comes from anyways).  It also has strong ties to MITRE FFRDCs, and is recruited heavily for Physics-oriented labs like Sandia and Los Alamos.\n\nCMU houses the SEI (Software Engineering Institute) FFRDC, but as you would imagine that is much more focused towards CS/IT, mostly Cybersecurity, although there are some efforts in Quantum: https://www.sei.cmu.edu/our-work/quantum-computing/\n\nAt the end of the day, CMU is more prestigious in CS than JHU is in Physics.  The tradeoff is that Quantum at both schools is primarily housed in Physics (QComputing is just an application of it).\n\nIf your question is which will open more doors?  CMU will open more doors in general, but JHU will open more doors in QC, especially related to defense.  Just take note that QC opportunities are not nearly as abundant as CS/IT opportunities, and a lot of Physics majors end up working in CS/IT anyways, so I would only choose JHU if you are extremely set on QC, and a career in academia/DoD research (where most opportunities will be).\n\nIn an ideal situation you could be bound for MIT, which is very prestigious in both fields, but honestly I believe you are well set if you choose either school, and you will have no problem finding a role with enough determination.  QC values things like research experience and networking a lot more than where you went to school.",

They are also very communicative with tenants. \n\nWhen i was first looking, they only sent me a video of the apartment and I did an in person tour. I didn\u2019t ask about a virtual tour though. I don\u2019t know much about their deposit returns though since i\u2019m staying there again next year. \n\nI had a friend that stayed in one of their houses in squirrel hill and had the same experience. They liked them enough to stay with the company and switch from their squirrel hill place to the same building i\u2019m in. \n\nI promise i\u2019m not paid to say this lol I genuinely like them a lot.",

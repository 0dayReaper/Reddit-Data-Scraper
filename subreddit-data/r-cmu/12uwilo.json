    "postText": "I know CMU is one of the only schools in the world to teach eurhythmics so I wanted to try it at least once. My high school choir teacher recommended it too. I sing for fun and did honors choir and AP music theory in high school, but I don\u2019t really have any other contact with music education otherwise. I think taking the class would be overkill, but I saw there are summer and winter workshops offered by CMU. The shortest summer workshop is 1 week and the winter one is a weekend long. Anyone have experience doing them? Would either be suited for a non music major just to try? Who is the target audience supposed to be?",

Don\u2019t have much formal music training so I can\u2019t really assess it, but it seemed primarily targeted as continuing education for music teachers.  The instructors were super nice and might let you attend for free if you reach out.",

I didn\u2019t end up pursuing a music degree but still incorporate some of the things I learned in it when I play or sing.",

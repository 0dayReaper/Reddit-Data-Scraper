    "postText": "Hi, so I'm applying to cmu this fall and I would rather choose a major outside of scs to have a better shot (25% vs 7% acc rate...)\n\nWithin CS, I am interested most in either ML/AI or software engineering. So far I think StatML or IS might be a good fit.\n\nOutside of general tips and info, answers to these questions would really help:\n\n1. Are the acceptance rates for these programs actually much higher than CS?\n\n2. Would it be feasible to add CS or AI as a second major or switch into one of these programs, or is it generally difficult to switch majors across schools?\n\n3. What are the differences between StatML and IS (and maybe AI/CS?\n\n4. What are the outcomes for IS and StatML majors (jobs/salaries)",

Do you think StatML could lend itself to a career or graduate degree in ML better/as good as CS would?",

I'm attempting that rn.\n\nStat ml is a stats major with a concentration in ml. IS is what you make of it, it's the cross between a lot of fields. Sorta like decision science.\n\noutcomes are approximately the same lol",

Please refer to [this link](https://csd.cmu.edu/academics/bachelors/guidelines-transfer-or-dual-degree).\n3. I would say if your interest lays in AI, StatML is a better fit because AI is very closely associated with statistics and machine learning.\n4.

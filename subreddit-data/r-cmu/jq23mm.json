After I took those calls, my job required me to write up a note as to why the individual is against donating and I had to submit it to whoever handles the alumni donations at cmu. I would get maybe like 10 of these calls a month? I think if they see a large enough trend, they\u2019ll finally get the message that literally no one wants him here. \n\nI quit because it was honestly making me depressed talking to so many angry people and begging for money on behalf the school. I don\u2019t blame y\u2019all for being annoyed at the calls, but it was def draining and not worth getting like $11/hr",

I'm sorry you need to field calls like this from grumpy jerks like me, but I hope it actually leads to something.",

I think some people I called forgot that I am also a cmu student too (taking out a lot of student loans may I add haha) and I was doing the job for the money alone. I honestly felt really guilty having to call alumni begging for money, but a good chunk of the calls I took were super nice and I even had a long convo with this one person where we just ranted about administration at CMU haha",

(The title didn't exist before him, and they followed the rules in hiring, to be very fair.)\n\nHe's a rabble-rouser who doesn't stick to facts and uses anger as a primary tactic, near as I can tell.  As the most recent example of that, he was the Trump Campaign spokesperson in Nevada this week shouting that the election was a fraud, and explicitly providing no proof.  MSNBC isn't always great, but has a clip on just this, as it was their reporter who followed up with the question.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/jomxcr/msnbc\\_reporter\\_demands\\_a\\_trump\\_campaign\\_official/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/jomxcr/msnbc_reporter_demands_a_trump_campaign_official/)\n\nPreviously, he's had several petitions against his appointment from within CMU:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KyZv\\_O01xRuwPzUX0N4yYY77RB7QIH1C4yMjetCK16U/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KyZv_O01xRuwPzUX0N4yYY77RB7QIH1C4yMjetCK16U/edit)",

There's a good summary about him here:\n\n[https://militarist-monitor.org/profile/richard-grenell/](https://militarist-monitor.org/profile/richard-grenell/)\n\nThe Institute for Politics and Strategy has a conservative department head (Kiron Skinner),  and as a favor to Grenell, who she worked with at one time, she brought him on. People were outraged. He has since been spreading disinformation, engaged in virus denialism, and worked as a political operative.\n\nThere's been such a big stink about it that it's been causing internal issues, and the president of the university sent out multiple emails to the entire community about it. Overall, there's an issue with the ISP (Institute for Politics and Strategy)  that they would bring him on in this way and think that it would be fine. (Like, it would be interesting to hear Steve Bannon talk, but would you really want to announce he's now a \"senior fellow\" and drawing a CMU paycheck...?)",

    "postText": "Heard all the other meal plans, even the red one, were too way much, so what do yall think about the yellow one\n\nred is 205 meal blocks, 850 flex dollars per sem for $3534\n\nyellow is 125 meal blocks, 190 flex dollars per sem for $1773\n\nI'm thinking of staying in rez on fifth or clyde js to take the yellow plan and save money on meal plans\n\nAlso a question, how much would a person who does not eat a lot and spend on food every semester (especially if they go for the more budget but filling and healthy options), if not on a meal plan?",

            "comment": "the amount you would save doing yellow + apartment is more around $500-900 per semester considering that the room is more expensive. but it\u2019s a lot fewer meals, so you\u2019d probably spend that on food outside. if you cook, you could definitely get a good meal for $5-7 on avg so that\u2019s an option, but if you buy out then it\u2019s probably $10+.",

I actually used up all of it, unlike some of my friends who got the red plan and ate 3 meals a day but somehow still didn\u2019t use up their meal plan. Plus, towards the end of the semester; everyone\u2019s trying to get rid of their meal plans, so even if you run out you can just get a block from a friend. I would say go for the yellow plan if you don\u2019t eat much in general",

            "comment": "As someone who lived in Rez last year, definitely take the yellow plan. On average, I had 7 block meals a week (lunch or dinner) and used the flex on energy drinks and snacks from the vending machines. Ended both semesters with exactly 0 blocks and basically 0 flex (did sell a few blocks in 2nd semester).\n\nAs for my other food costs:\n\nCooking with fresh ingredients is probably $3-5/meal. I also got frozen meals from Trader Joes that are $5-7 each.\n\nFor breakfast, I ate 2 scrambled eggs, ramen, and an apple ($2?) in the first semester and Costco pastries (\\~$1 each) in the second semester after sharing a membership with my roommate. But some block meal portions are very big, so you can get away with skipping breakfast entirely and still have sufficient calories.\n\nSo assuming $8 of outside food/day, for 4 months a sem, that's $960.\n\nI also ate out on average 3x a month (\\~$20/trip).",

            "comment": "The flex dollars was godsend for me TBH. I didn't really use my blocks so I sold them to upperclassmen (got around $20 a week doing this) and still ended with about 20 blocks to spare at the end of the semester. Instead I used a lot of my flex for the on-campus convenience store for stuff like AAA batteries, some tylenol/advil/nyquil/dayquil, blackberries, and late night snacks. You can also use flex for off-campus pizza delivery which is great if you wanna blow through the $400 dollars near the end of the semester (it's always great tipping drivers and you can get food faster sometimes \ud83d\ude0b )",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am currently a sophomore in high school, and I am applying to CMU's Precollege residential program called Summer Session. If I do get accepted, I will enroll in \"Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science\"(15-112) and \"Concepts of Mathematics\"(21-127), which are two real CMU courses. The entire program lasts 6 weeks and costs 12k. My family is willing to pay full tuition, but I am wondering if and why this program(these two courses specifically) is worth that much money.\n\nThank you and Happy New Year,",

Many of the pre-college students were some of our strongest and we have a lot of resources you can use. I have heard that in that summer (\u201822) concepts didn\u2019t allow precollege students into office hours because they didn\u2019t get full clearances for their staff so that\u2019s something to note. Overall, I think both courses are awesome and you\u2019ll learn a lot. Whether it\u2019s worth it depends on both your family\u2019s financial situation and what you would be doing instead of this program.",

Even though it is a CS class, nearly all engineering students and STEM in general take it. Beyond that, even business and liberal arts students take it. The goal of 15112 is to take a complete newcomer and make them into an intermediate level programmer.\n\nAs for 21127, it's a proof-based math course, which is something most high schoolers have never encountered. It requires you to take a different approach to solving problems and really expands your way of thinking. If you're thinking of studying CS, a lot of the problems you will encounter will require proof-based thinking.\n\nAgain, these courses will likely be very difficult if they're not watering it down as they're the basic requirements for the CS major/minor at CMU. But if you're planning on studying CS, engineering, or math, you'll definitely come out the better for it.",

Just like what this person said, both classes aren't easy, and as a previous participant of the CMU Summer program, it took me a couple of weeks to adjust to the college learning process (going to office hours...). \n\nIf you do end up choosing one of the classes, I would encourage you to take 15112. It's a very well-taught introductory course and opens you to a lot of things, and the term project at the end of the course is also very rewarding, which you can 100% include in your college application. 21127, on the other hand, is more theoretical and more difficult than 15112 in my opinion.",

            "comment": "I think whether or not it is worth it is dependent on what you want to get out of it. I took 21-127 and 15-122 in my sophmore going into junior year of high school, and am a current sophmore here in ECE. For me, I probably took ~25 hours a week on 15-122 and ~20 hours a week on average for 21-127.\n\nI think it is a way of getting accustomed to living away from your parents, make new friends (who are likely similarly minded to you), get a feel for what college classes might be like, and figure out if CS is something that you definitely don\u2019t see yourself doing in the future. For example, if you hate the content of 21-127, I would advise thinking a lot before setting your heart on SCS. \n\nIf you are trying to take this to boost your chances at getting into CMU or other colleges, you likely won\u2019t get that. Of my group of five friends who took the same courses as me over the summer (we all did well), only one of them got into SCS, and he definitely would have gotten in even if he hadn\u2019t taken the courses. Also, if you don\u2019t go to CMU, you likely won\u2019t be able to transfer credit, (but my friend who went to Michigan was able to transfer 21-127).\n\nI haven\u2019t taken 15-112, but I\u2019ve heard it is a good introduction to (python) programming (and also maybe computational complexity). I\u2019m pretty sure there are some term projects (and maybe even course material) publicly available to peruse, and that might give you a good feel for if 15-112 is worth your time/money, especially if you want a more structured and supported learning environment. Being able to code a project like that (even without having taken 15-112) would likely prepare you to make other projects that would look impressive on your resume, and might even prepare you for hackathons or getting an internship while you are in high school.\n\nAs far as 21-127 goes, I found it much more conceptually difficult than 15-122, and spent a lot of time in office hours. As others have said, it is a proof based math theory class. Looking back on it after having taken more classes here, I think it helps you nurture a very valuable style of thinking, as understanding why something works (like in math) makes future classes much easier. If you\u2019ve already done competition math, I\u2019m not sure how much you\u2019ll get out of 127. However, if you haven\u2019t done competition math, it is a good way of getting into that, and you also will get a glimpse at some of the type of thinking that you\u2019d do if you go to SCS. One thing to keep in mind is that there will (likely) be two years between taking 21-127 and going to college, which leaves a lot of time for you to forget the material if you haven\u2019t used it or tried to learn more.\n\nI know that was a lot but feel free to DM me if you have any questions.",

            "comment": "112 and concepts are both really great classes so I would definitely recommend them in general. I will say tho that taking them both together will be super time consuming and stressful \u2014 for 112 you will have to do the whole term project (~3 weeks long during a usual semester) in one week, and I found concepts to be super fast paced when I took it in a usual semester so I can only imagine that summer concepts would be a lot more intense.\n\nIf you have to choose one, I would personally choose 112 as it\u2019s my favorite class I\u2019ve taken at CMU (might be biased tho bc I\u2019m a 112 TA). Also, I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s teaching the summer session of concepts, but imo (if you want to come to CMU) it may be worth waiting to take concepts until you can take it with Clive Newstead. He wrote the textbook for the course and is one of the best professors I\u2019ve had. \n\nUltimately, though, it depends on your interests and what you feel you will enjoy more! I would start with looking at the schedules for both classes:\n\nhttps://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/schedule.html \n\nClive\u2019s version of 21-127 is on Canvas and not available publicly online, but I found a schedule from an older version of the course: https://www.math.cmu.edu/~mradclif/teaching/127S19/calendar.html\n\nAnd I think Clive\u2019s textbook is also worth looking at! https://infinitedescent.xyz",

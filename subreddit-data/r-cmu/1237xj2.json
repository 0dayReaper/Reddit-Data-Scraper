He provides academic advisement and will eventually prepare your committee letter of recommendation as part of your med school application package. He is a nice guy, but he is very busy and won't have time to speak to you very often since he is in charge of all health-related professions advising (so including dental, veterinary, optometry as well). Stay on his good side.",

We have a thing called grade deflation, unlike other schools like Harvard or Stanford, a B at Carnegie Mellon is like an A somewhere else. Our classes are notoriously demanding and the student body is competitive. And it is absolutely possible to flunk out of this school. \n\nThis is not ideal for a premed applicant trying to maintain a high GPA. However, take everything I say with a grain of salt as I am an engineering major.\n\nFun fact, B stands for bad at Stanford.",

I've never had a class where grades were curved down, and more commonly they're curved up. Granted, grades are inflated AF at ivy's, so the end results are the same, but I'm confident med school AOs know this.",

I should rephrase, it\u2019s simply harder to achieve an A here than at an Ivy League for instance. From what I read the average graduating CIT GPA is a 2.9 - 3.2, which is relatively lower than other schools.\n\nI\u2019m sure Med School OA\u2019s are familiar with CMU and so are recruiters for those looking to tap into the industry. But having a sub 3.8 GPA will hurt you regardless of which school you went to, given that it was possible for someone in your class to achieve a higher GPA than you. However, I must remind people that Med School admission is holistic.",

A few things you should probably keep in mind:\n- The classes you take here are significantly harder than other (similarly ranked) schools so getting a high GPA is a lot more difficult \n- From what I\u2019ve heard, there aren\u2019t a whole lot of premed students here so there isn\u2019t as much support as there might be in other places \n- I only took a few bio major requirements, so I can\u2019t speak for the program as a whole, but I feel like the intro courses aren\u2019t as well designed and structured and don\u2019t offer as much support as the intro CS and math ones\n\nI think CMU would be a good choice if you\u2019re interested in the intersection of bio with other fields (like biopsych, or neuroscience/computational neuroscience, or computational bio) since we\u2019re known for having good interdisciplinary programs, but if you want to study pure bio and be premed, I would possibly recommend against coming here\u2026",

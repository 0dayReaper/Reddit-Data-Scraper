    "postText": "I love the campus. Its beautiful! A mix of super Gothic hard-core winter tank architecture like Wean, hamerschlag, and doherty, contrasted with the modernity of Gates and Scott hall. You can tell that the Tepper building was like a mix of the two styles. I seriously love the Tepper building btw, its like a building from the future!!\n\nThe makerspaces with the meches grinding away look so cool. Im proud of going here because I'm surrounded by such talented and hard working people. I like to imagine that when I get out into the working world, ill tell people I went to CMU, and because they can imagine what my classmates are like, they think some scrub like me is on their level!\n\nI'm just playing. CMU is my home away from home. The professors have my back so, so much. My department is like a family. I dont like some of them and I think some of them are annoying, but man I love them all. Because everyone in this school seems to have my back!\n\nI didn't always feel this way. I HATED cmu when I first came here. Absolutely hated it. In my first few years here, i wanted to jump off Pausch bridge a few times. I felt so, so, so alone. So homesick and resentful. I had some dark winters at this school.\n\nBut I stuck through it. No, WE stuck through it. Together. Every office hour, every frat party where the nerds finally let off some steam, every crappy taste of India plate, every amazing exchange sandwich, every ice cold night waiting to paint the fence, every holding the door open for the person behind you, everything. Every bit of it, we did it and do it together.\n\nToday, I am a proud tartan. So, so proud. I love this school. I love its people, its pride, its passion, its innovativeness, its inclusiveness, its resilience, its accepting of all people from anywhere and any background, its solidarity in the face of adversity, and just, its CMU-ness!!\n\nI love the way CMU embraces all its quirks.\n\nI love the way I've always been able to find a listening ear, as long as I asked humbly and expected nothing. Maybe I couldn't get an extension every time, but im grateful nonetheless.\n\nAnd I love the way that my experience here has shaped me into the person I am today, for better or for worse.\n\nI love this school. If you don't feel this way, I respect that. But I dont feel the same way as you.\n\nI love CMU. I love it deeply in my heart. So GO TARTANS!!\n\n\n\n\nEdit: more things I love about CMU:\n\n I love going to Schatz and eating until I feel like exploding. \n\nI love seeing freshmen start to make friends, and overhearing their conversations with each other and theyre awkward as hell lol. Freshmen everywhere are awkward, but these are CMU freshmen. Now This is awkwardness on steroids!\n\nI loved breaking into the graduate ECE lounge, getting to the top of the hamerschlag rotunda, and smoking a joint up there with friends. (Im not advocating for you to do this,, im just acknowledging that this happens.. also dont do drugs.) \n\nI love flagstaff Hill. Its view is so hard to beat!\n\nI love sleeping on those reclining chairs in Sorells.\n\nI love going to the 2nd floor of wean and picking out candy and chips like a goddamn child to prep for the all nighter ahead of me.\n\nI loved when orgs would set up in front of Doherty and I would have to look straight ahead and avoid eye contact because sorry, im not interested!!\n\nI love that doherty hall kind of smells.\n\nI love that non SCS students can't get above the 5th (6th?) Story of Gates, because I like to tell visitors that they do some crazy missile tracking, drone bombing, Middle East terrorizing computer science up there. But they probably do do that, which is kind of fucked up. Still, Its funny to see visitors eyes widen from imagining the mystery of it.\n\nI love the first day of spring thats above 65 degrees each year. The entire campus is ALIVE with activity.\n\nI love the gyms in the UC and in Tepper. Non-CMU students tell me that when they drive past our school on Forbes, they get super jealous of our gyms, and sports fields.\n\nI love the evenings when I'm having a pleasant evening and I hear the Kiltie Band playing from the cut. On moodier days, im like \"Yo keep it down!!\" But more often its just another quirk of CMU im proud of.\n\nCarnival is cool too, which may be the understatement of this entire subreddit!!\n\nWalking to the sky looks like shit though imo ngl. They need to bulldoze that thing over asap. Its funny though, it actually used to have half the number of \"people\" on it, and then one day we woke up and they filled in the gaps with more \"people\". It kind of freaked us out, as if they were starting to multiply or something lol.\n\nI love walking from Gates to Donner through the path next to Gesling Stadium. When its winter and they have all the xmas lights up. That walk is really nice!\n\nEdit2: a few more things\n\nI love how from around 5 pm to 7:30 pm, everyone that lives in squirrel hill is at the forbes and morewood bus stop, but sometimes the busses just get too full of people to let more people on.. when its super cold, this is the worst!! I had a method though, I would always flank the crowd from the right, somehow that always worked and I always one of the first people to get on the bus.\n\nBooth and buggy are cool!\n\nI loved giving blocks to my friends as a freshman. It was a great way to become friends with upperclassmen",

It was a difficult 4 years of undergrad and another difficult 1.5 years of grad school, but I honestly loved the experience and the people I've met along the way. CMU is hard, but I've learned so much during my time there that I wouldn't trade it for anything.",

I *went* to other schools for my undergrad and masters, but I *lived* CMU.\n\nAlso, CMU being hard is kind of the point. I was surrounded by some of the smartest minds I've ever met, but they're also the kindest most hardworking and helpful people I've met and I'm happy to still call them my friends.",

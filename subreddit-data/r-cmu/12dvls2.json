    "postText": " \n\nHi everyone,\n\nI was recently accepted into College of Engineering for Fall 2023, and I'm super excited to start this fall! However, I have a question about choosing a major.\n\nMy admit letter says *\"Congratulations! It is an honor to invite you to join Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering for Fall 2023. If you enroll in the  College of Engineering, you will have the opportunity to select a major  from the departments of Chemical Engineering, Civil &amp; Environmental  Engineering, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, Mechanical  Engineering or Materials Science &amp; Engineering, as well as our  double major programs in Engineering &amp; Public Policy and Biomedical  Engineering.\"* \n\nWhen I applied, I selected Materials Science &amp; Engineering as my major of interest, since most of my extracurricular activities were chemistry-related and at that time I was interested in materials science and nanotechnology. However, now I'm leaning towards Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, and I'm wondering if I'll have the opportunity to switch my major when I start this fall.\n\nWill I be able to choose my major right away, or do I have to wait until the end of my first year and choose based on my grades in the mandatory \"Intro to ECE\" course in my freshman semesters? I'm just a bit confused about the process and would appreciate any advice or insights from current students or alumni.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

First year engineering workload (if you are not planning to double major CS) is fairly manageable imho. I can pm you my schedule if you are interested. As for programming, the programming/CS intro class at CMU (15-112) is fairly easy and does not require prior knowledge, but you may find learning some Python beforehand helpful (15-112 is taught in Python, and later labs in ECE intro/18-100 require you to code in Python)",

    "postText": "Hello!  \n\n\nDoes anybody have the syllabus for Enviroment 1: Climate and Energy taught w/Vivian L.? I took it back in 2021 and my grad school coordinator needs the syllabus to see if the course could be waived. I  don't have access to canvas or any of my course information since graduating. I tried emailing her, but  haven't received a response  \n\n\nDM me if you have a copy of the syllabus (2021 preferred, but I'll take anything) and I'll tell you where to email it.",

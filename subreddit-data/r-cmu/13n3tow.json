            "comment": "11-485 has a very heavy workload, but very rewarding at the end. You do multiple HWs that enable you to code some of the PyTorch functions yourself, and also train models for deep learning tasks in speech and one HW for face recognition and verification. I\u2019ve heard CV is more math-y and not deep learning focussed. 11-485 also supports collaborative work with study groups so i suggest joining with a group in mind to make things easier.",

            "comment": "I took 16-385 last fall. Personally I think it was a very rewarding class. You get to learn a lot of cool cv algos, implement them(from scratch/numpy), and watch them run. As comment above says, it does get quite mathy at times(you definitely need some linear alg + calc knowledge to get through). Debugging could also get annoying since it is all numerical data \ud83d\ude02. Also if grades is ever an issue, CV has ample extra credit with homework assignments(which is the majority of your grade), although you do need to spend time doing them.\n\nThere are two assignment in CV that has to do with deep learning I think. You make a small neural net from scratch in one, and in the other you do scene recognition. The thing you don\u2019t get a lot of practice with though is frameworks like PyTorch.",

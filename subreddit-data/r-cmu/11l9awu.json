    "postText": "Hello! Im an international applicant who got accepted to the programme ( \\^ ) today. I am truly overjoyed. Before applying, as any student does, I went through the website and absolutely loved the course curriculum and freedom one can have while in the degree. \n\nHowever, a lot of information w.r.t the experience of how the degree is wasnt found on the internet (even on reddit, sadly). I really hope a current EST&amp;P student sees this because I'd be super grateful if someone could tell me how the 3 semester course ACTUALLY is. My concentration would be Engineering and Public Policy and I come from a chemical engg background (undergrad). Also, is the 100k+ worth it?\n\nIf any of you have friends in the course, please do tell them about this post. I'm a prospective student and truthfully a little lost.",

    "postText": "Hi! I hope this is an appropriate place to post this. I'm currently stuck deciding between paying full for CMU Tepper and UMD CS + 50k scholarship (out-of-state btw). \n\n**A bit of context:**\n\nIn terms of what I want out of college, I value good job prospects and a well-rounded and collaborative community. I'm not too big on Greek life or anything, and I really want to go somewhere where I can learn as much as I can both in and out of the classroom. I'm not set on a major yet (I really like both business and CS \ud83d\ude2d). I also have a lot of college credits since I'm graduating high school with an associate degree (60 credits) and I would love for some of these credits to transfer. My parents are letting me decide what college I want to go to, so although they don't want me to worry about cost, they still want me to consider it in my decision. \n\n**Pros/Cons?**\n\nCMU is obviously really prestigious, the classes there are amazing, and I oddly don't mind the hustle culture. I think college is what you make out of it, and I know CMU is high risk but high reward. I'm hoping to get a double major between business and another STEM major. The only thing I'm iffy about is that they won't tell me how many credits will transfer until over the summer. So I don't know whether or not I can graduate in 3 years, which is pretty important considering I have to pay in full at CMU. \n\nCMU and UMD cultures are day and night, and I think I'll enjoy the social aspect of UMD a lot. I love how UMD is right next to DC, which can make a big difference in job prospects and internships. The issue is, UMD is HUGEE and it feels like I won't be able to find a tight-knit group of friends or receive the same sort of help as I can at CMU. I also feel like if I go to UMD, I won't have the time to switch majors or explore my interests as much at CMU. But then again, the cost and time would also be less than CMU.\n\nIs CMU Tepper's prestige worth it? \n\nWhat do you think I should do in this situation?",

They should list the requirements for other credit transfers. Usually it has to be in person and have a syllabus that shows what was covered. You can understand how they don't have time to review every prospective student's college credits.\nI think you have a pretty good understanding of your choice, except I think your underestimating the social life of Tepper, and CMU in general, students.\nGood luck.",

            "comment": "I had this same decision! UMD CS vs CMU ECE, so I can't speak to business much. I have a ton of friends at UMD CS (Went to HS in MD), and they're all really smart and seem to be having a decent time, but constantly complain about no success in job/internship search. The way they put it, there's *so many* of them, and they all look the same to recruiters, even though the program is good.\n\nIn my sophomore year as ECE at CMU, every single friend/co-TA in CS/ECE/IS/Stat ML who wanted a Facebook interview got one. As a junior, most people around me think an Amazon/Microsoft/Facebook is not bad, but not particularly difficult or special. Two of my good friends in CS never programmed before college, and are making over $100/hr at their upcoming summer internships. Good career opportunities don't rain down from the sky, but if you grind for them, you'll get them. In my experience, schools with less prestige unfortunately cannot guarantee this much.\n\nAt this point I haven't *really* answered your question, and here's where I tie it together - have you considered CMU CS? It is **difficult**, but you mentioned you don't mind the hustle. I, my gf, and two good friends transferred from ECE/Tepper to CS, and the transfer is basically guaranteed if you have good enough grades on a set of 6 brutal classes. Just wanted to put this on the radar as a plus for CMU.",

If you know you want to try for it earlier, taking some of the harder classes like the two I mentioned over the summer is a great option, as they're easier then and you have more time to focus on them. Many people who don't end up doing research/internship their first year, which is very common.\n\nI do want to emphasize that it is not at all easy. In sophomore year my weekends were full of work and I hardly went out, and most of my time with friends was working together on assignments. I ended up overshooting the required grades though, so it might not have to be so bad.",

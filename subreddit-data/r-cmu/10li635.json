    "postText": "Hi, My name is Cole and I am part of the Undergraduate directing program in the School of Drama, and my directing class urgently needs actors for this semester, and we would love to have anyone! It\u2019ll just be a very low stakes chance to act in 2-3 scenes directed by students throughout the semester, and get a few credits. Your work would help our learning very much, and the focus of the class doesn't require you to have any experience in acting (But if you do, that is great!). So if you are free from 11-1 (or for any hour in that timeframe) on tuesdays and thursdays, then please add yourself to the waitlist for 54192 (Acting Ensemble for non-majors) and our professor, Will Davis, will contact you with info about the course and how to join us. We really need a few more people so if you or anyone you know is interested in acting or directing or plays/film, please sign up for the course or email our professor for more info. (Or message me on here) We would love to have you!",

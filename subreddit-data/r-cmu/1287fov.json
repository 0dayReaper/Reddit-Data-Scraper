            "comment": "(Correct me if I'm wrong but:) It depends on where you're from / what your residency is. You'll be paying federal taxes and local taxes, but PhD stipends are tax-exempt for the state of Pennsylvania. If you're a resident in another state that doesn't have reciprocal agreements with Pennsylvania, you may also have to pay those state taxes. Tax brackets depend on total income, which will also include any income you get from internships and etc.\n\nUPitt has a page with some better details about this: [https://payroll.pitt.edu/us-tax-information-4/](https://payroll.pitt.edu/us-tax-information-4/)\n\nFor what it's worth - CMU offers a pretty good stipend in a relatively low cost-of-living area compared to many other top research universities. You will not be anywhere close to starving here, and you could probably eat out at restaurants for every meal if you are dead set on doing so (though I wouldn't recommend that).",

They'll be more than happy to help you responsibly enjoy your partner. \n\nIn situations like this, I find it personally helps me to declare that I'm embarrassed. So when I act weird, everyone else involved knows that's the reason I'm being shifty.",

You\u2019ll need to make an appointment for those somewhere, whether it\u2019s UHS or a local clinic.  (If you want to go off campus for that for whatever reason, the planned parenthood downtown will take good care of you.  Allegheny Reproductive Health Center in E. Liberty is also great, but they\u2019re pretty swamped with abortion services and I don\u2019t know how long their waitlist is right now for routine care.)",

    "postText": "So i\u2019m a junior in hs and i submitted an application to CMU\u2019s pre-college program NHSGA (national high school game academy) on march 8th, about a week before the deadline for admissions was (march 15th). Their website says decisions will be sent by April 5th (today). It\u2019s rolling admission tho so I feel like I would have received an email a little before april 5th. Also, pennsylvania is 3 hours ahead of my time zone (california) and it\u2019s 11pm right now, meaning it\u2019s already the next day, april 6th, there. I\u2019m worried something might have happened with my application, like something got lost or corrupted idk to make them not receive it or part of it or something like that. you can prolly tell i\u2019m stressed and tired from how i\u2019m typing. Has anyone heard of someone getting their summer pre-college admission decision late? Did I screw up my application somehow? was I supposed to apply earlier before the international deadline since I will be flying in from california or was I right and it doesnt count? hhh thank you for any feedback you can offer, i\u2019ll gladly accept anything &lt;3",

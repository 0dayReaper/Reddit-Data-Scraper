    "postText": "Hi folks, \n\nI have been admitted to the Masters in Software Engineering program at Carnegie Mellon University, and I am truly impressed by its course offerings. However, given the current market scenarios(ongoing layoffs), I am hesitant to pursue the program. Although my current salary of $55,000 in India is considered good here, I would have to take a loan of $100,000 to attend the program and compete for placements next August(2024). \n\nMy concern is that the job market may not improve by then, and I may not be able to secure a decent job. As an Indian, I am also subject to stringent immigration laws, and I only have 90 days to find a job on OPT. Additionally, I must find a company that is financially strong enough to sponsor my H1B Visa application. Although I recognize the prestige of CMU, these factors are causing me significant anxiety.",

Many companies in other industries are still hiring and the competition for those roles is normal. Which isn\u2019t to say that getting a job will be *easy*, you still have to be competent; but, it\u2019s not any harder now than at most other times. \n\nMoreover, you\u2019ll never regret investing in yourself (so do it early and often), and timing the job market is as difficult as timing the stock market (exploit opportunities when they arise, but be flexible). \n\nSource: got my BSCS in 2011 from somewhere else, MS from CMU in 2013, and have had no problems finding positions since then.",

I feel like most of the software engineering jobs in the US can be obtained with a bachelor degree with the exception of few positions. Also, finding jobs will not be easy if you are looking for people to sponsor a H1B visa even when you take in account the prestige of CMU.",

You will most definitely earn it back with some time. Also, like others are saying, by the time you graduate the market will probably be better than its current state.\n\n\nCongrats again :)",

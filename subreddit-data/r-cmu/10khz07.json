    "postText": "Asking because typesetting the first homeworks took me a long time, probably more time than solving the problems, and I predict homework taking more time from here on.\n\nI'm thinking of switching to handwritten, but my concern is that my handwritten solutions might sacrifice some quality. When I typeset, it's easier to go back and add more justification, revise, etc., and it's also easier for the grader to read.\n\nSounds like a small thing to ask but wondering what you prefer &amp; how it's worked out for you? Thank you!",

While it made my homework organized and easy to read, it ended up taking hours of my time that would have been better spent sleeping \u2014 and as the homework got longer and harder, it took more and more time to finish. Unless your homework is illegible without using LaTeX, it\u2019s better to just turn in handwritten work. I probably spent at least 40% more time than I needed to on every homework just writing everything up. It\u2019s better to use that time to do other schoolwork or get a full night\u2019s sleep.",

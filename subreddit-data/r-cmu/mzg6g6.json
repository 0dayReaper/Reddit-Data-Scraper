            "comment": "There used to be a building called the Old Student Center on Forbes across the street from Morewood dorms. There was a steep driveway that led to a little parking lot where the campus police station was. At the other end of the parking lot was a weird looking garage thing. I was told it was the police evidence locker. Now, right next to the evidence locker there was a side door into the Old Student Center. If you went in that door and down two flights of stairs to the basement there was this poorly-lit, moldy, rat-infested, dank-ass room with a cage in it. If you look up dank in the dictionary, you will see a picture of that room. The cage in that room is where we, the CMU ice hockey team, stored our hockey gear in between games and practices until the year 2000, when we moved our gear storage room to the Skibo gym. Okay, so in that basement, three of the walls were made of wood/drywall and the fourth wall was cinder blocks. In that cinder block wall was a door with very explicit warnings on it, something to the effect of \"Unauthorized personnel prohibited beyond this point under section \\[number\\] of the US Code. Deadly force authorized.\"\n\nFor three years I wondered, \"What the fuck could be behind that door?\" Nobody knew. Over the years, I asked everyone. I asked hockey alumni, professors, random campus maintenance staff, deans, etc. Eventually I talked to Dean Murphy? who was Dean of Student Affairs at the time. He finally told me the answer. As you probably know, CMU has always taken heavy funding from the Department of Defense and has long been at the forefront of military software design. Behind the door in the cinder block wall was the dive tank for testing underwater missile/torpedo guidance software for the US military. Apparently the building that I was told was the evidence locker room was actually the top of the dive tank (and may have also been used for the evidence locker room, not sure). \n\nIf anyone knows more about this subject than me, please fill in the gaps or correct any misunderstandings I have. Remember, I heard this from a Dean - he may not have had all the correct info himself.",

                    "comment": "The 'Old Student Center' or sometimes the \"Temporary Student Center\" was originally a building built and owned by the Navy.  There was even a little mast on top where NROTC students could go up and fly a flag or whatever.\n\nI vaguely remember that there was a big pool/tank in the building but didn't think it was ever used for military research.  I thought it was just used for training.\n\nThe building was bought out fully by CMU when they went to (finally) tear down Skibo, the 'student center that wasn't a student center' that had been built in the '60s. Skibo was a very weirdly designed building with lots of problems, among them rats 'n' roaches (because nearly ALL of CMU's food services was in the building) and lack of space for student orgs because the administration kept taking over more and more space. On top of that, the building design and location didn't allow for further expansions of the building itself.  \n\nThe first step towards getting rid of Skibo was when they tore down the old stadium [which used to face Maggie Mo] and put in a new one 90 degrees from the old one  which was also part of the new parking garage.  There was originally a lot of local pushback against building the garage but CMU has long held weight with the city government.\n\nWhen they finally started tearing Skibo down, the NROTC building became the pseudo-student center.  CMU didn't really have a \"real\" attempt at a student center until the current building.",

            "comment": " The Wreck of the Morewood Piano.\n\n\nMorewood, if you didn't know, was originally an apartment building.  With the exception of E-tower, which was added on later, the 4 \"towers\" were all apartments, two to a floor.  I was in A tower in the olden days and you could see all the signs -- there was a doorway on either side of the elevator, each with a painted-over button (doorbell) next to it. Each side had a single room which had clearly been a walk-in closet. The bathroom was still the bathroom but expanded (IIRC it was combined with the kitchen area).  After renovations were done throughout the '80s, the place no longer looked like the apartments they once were.\n\nAt some point in the late '70s, probably due to a grant or donation, CMU sprouted a bunch of baby grand pianos.  One went into the lobby of Morewood which, at the time, was mostly Gray Matter and a relatively big TV.  [Gray Matter was this bizarre seating stuff that was basically particle board covered in this tight, ugly, gray carpeting. It was at one point in Morewood, Skibo, Donner, and I forget where else.]\n\nOne night, a bunch of nutbags decided to steal the piano. And they did, and they somehow not only got it out of Morewood but across the street and they dumped it in front of the main doors of Warner.  \n\nSomeone called Phys Plant to have them come remove it.  They came out, stared at it for a while, scratched their heads, and drove off.  Then they came back with implements of destruction, destroyed that piano, and drove off with the pieces.\n\nBack in the '70s &amp; '80s, Pi Lam [Pi Lambda Phi] was known for singing original parody songs for Greek Sing.  One year, one of the songs was [The Wreck of the Morewood Piano](http://schmitt.org/henry/pilam/song-WOTMP.html).\n\n\nAnyone want to hear the tale of the Great Protest Against a Huge Tuition Increase (With Cookies)?",

Get comfortable and grab a $BEVERAGE. This is a long read\nand a ride that's both funny and infuriatingly CMU bureaucracy at its\nworst.\n\n\nYou know it as Cyert Hall but it was originally the UCC -- the\nUniversity Computing Center.  Campus computing used to be based in\nScience Hall [you call it Wean] but that building was getting crowded,\nespecially as computer science was growing as a major.\n\n\nThe UCC was funded in part by funding from IBM, who was going to\ncreate a new distributed computing environment.  As part of the\ndeal, once it was stable it was to become the primary computing\nenvironment for the campus, to replace the aging TOPS-20 machines that\nwere currently running everything.  The CMU administration has long had a jealousy over MIT's achievements.  CMU wanted their own version of MIT's Athena, so this was to be the start of the Andrew project.\n\n\nThe IBM group would get the top\nfloor of the building and campus computing services could have the rest.  The\ncatch?  CMU had to pay a major part of the building costs. And how were they\ngoing to do this?  By raising tuition. By a lot.  \n\nThe then-president of CMU, Richard (aka Dick) Cyert, was an economist. When he\ntook over CMU he took over a university with financial problems and he\nput the university into the black, moving more money into investments,\nand if he wasn't the one who started funding CMU spin-off companies for a cut of the profits, he\ncertainly encouraged and supported it.  So it's not like he didn't\nknow how to make money for the university.\n\nThe students, however, were not happy to learn -- from the city\nnewspapers -- that tuition was going to get a big hike, and that IBM was benefiting from the whole thing. After much yelling around campus, the Student Body\nPresident announced a protest to be held in front of Warner Hall.\n\nNow, let me tell you about the person who was SPB at the time.  He still is a great\nperson with a wicked sense of humor.  He ran for office on a platform\nthat included \"removing the &amp; from H&amp;SS\" (that's the original name for\nDietrich College, for you young'uns). During the campaign he showed up 5 minutes late for\na scheduled debate, apologizing profusely. He got to his seat, opened up a\nbriefcase, took out a pile of papers, took out another pile of papers, and then... a package of Twinkies.  He opened the package, pulled one\nout, and took a bite. Then he held up the package and said, \"Sorry,\ndoes anyone want the other one?\"  (Somewhere I have a copy of the Tartan's\npicture of the reaction of the WRCT engineer\nlive-broadcasting the debate.)\n\nThe SBP called for a protest to be held at 3 pm on a date in the next\nweek.  \n\nThe day of the protest came and it was\na warm fall day, getting into that period that happens twice a year,\nwhen it's too hot during the day for the heating but too cold at night\nfor the A/C.  Warner had HVAC problems for years and on nice days it\nwasn't uncommon to see the windows open, as many were that day. This\ncould be a problem when the days were warm enough but the nights went\nbelow freezing, as sometimes people forgot to close the windows\n[despite tons of signs and email] and pipes would freeze or burst.\n\n\nI got there fairly early and got to see ALL the antics.  At first it\nwas just a few people wandering around.  Then the A/V dept showed up\nwith some speakers-on-a-stick, a small podium, and a microphone, as\nthe crowd started to fill out.  The podium was set up on the edge of\nthe Warner patio so everyone else is on the Cut.  A bunch of guys from\none of the fraternities came across the street with a giant couch,\nonto which four or five got comfy.  People showed up with signs, from\nsimple \"CMU Already Costs Too Much\" and \"CMU not IBM\"  type stuff, to the two that have\nstuck in my head for nearly 40 years: A picture of Andrew Carnegie with the words, \"My heart is in the work. My hand is in your pocket,\" and a picture of Dr Cyert that said, \"Dick Cyert Before He Dicks You.\"\n\n\nJust as the SBP was about to start, a bunch of tables were set up in\nfront of Warner and a small swarm of people set stuff up on them.  The\nthen-Dean of student Affairs, a jackass who got fired a few years\nlater [but that's a whole other suite of stories], came over and asked\nfor the mic and said something like, \"We want to talk to the students\nabout this issue. There will be an open meeting in the Skibo Ballroom\nnext Wednesday, [DATE], at 4 pm. We hope to see you there. We've put\nout some cider and cookies, compliments of the University. Please help\nyourself.\"  And then he wandered back into Warner.\n\nThere were two or three other speakers besides the SBP, who talked about\nhow CMU was already too expensive, how we had the right to know of\nmajor changes that would directly affect us (and not find out through\nthe newspapers), and how this contract with IBM to fund the building\nwas unbalanced in IBM's favor and another step to CMU becoming\ncorporate owned.  Some speakers got us shouting chants. \"Let Warner\nHall hear you!\"\n\nNobody had noticed that the trays of cookies, the whole trays, had been walked into \nthe crowd until someone yelled, \"LET THEM EAT COOKIES!\" and cookies\nstarted flying at the open windows of Warner.  When they made it\ninside, the cheers were loud.  Within a minute, the windows started\nslamming closed, except for one.  One lone window, probably the window\nof someone who'd gone home early and forgotten to close their window.\nAll the cookies were now aiming at that window. The crowd was chanting and laughing \nand cheering madly when a cookie made it in.  Then, suddenly, a hand\nappeared and SLAM the window was shut.\n\n\nThat was pretty much the end of the protest, and people started wandering away.  The SBP had repeatedly encouraged everyone to show up to that meeting the next week.\n\nSo folks did.  A smaller crowd of people showed up at the Skibo Ballroom on the appointed day at the appointed time, only to find the\ndoors locked and a sign on them, stating that the \"Open meeting with\nstudents about the tuition increase\" was rescheduled for Monday, with a date that was two days before.  \n\nWhen the administration was questioned on this move, they refused to\nreschedule the meeting, stating that \"it already took place.\"\n\nThe \"distributed computing environment\" IBM built became the original Andrew system, which in part became a  filesystem which you may know as AFS. For a while, AFS was an IBM product and they charged an arm &amp; three legs for it.  Now it's FOSS.  Parts of the original Andrew included a mail and newsreader, a WYSIWG editor, a mail system back end, a window manager and tons more.  Almost all but the filesystem was a flop; most annoyingly to CMU-I-Wanna-Be-MIT, Andrew's window manager lost out big to X11 from MIT.\n\nAnd now you know why Cyert Hall is the perfect name for that building.",

Posner Hall (I think that's what its called) was where they would have undergrad events for the business majors, and I think a lot of business courses too. We used to have classes sprinkled all over the place before they finished construction on the Tepper Quad and just shoved basically everything there. It was kind of weird going from running around all over campus to pretty much just shuffling between floors in one building.",

Apparently, a student hid under the floor in one of the computer clusters, and at night came out, opened up the computers, and stole the RAM. However, he accidentally left his tools there, which were branded with the name of the company he did an internship with that past summer. It didn't take the police very long to find him. \n\nAnd of course, there is Randy Pausch in general. Go watch his Last Lecture and you'll hear a lot about CMU. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo",

My uncle went to Pitt in the 90s and early 00s and he said that there was a CMU student at that time who was doing some performance art project. This student apparently dressed up as a farm animal (chicken, cow, etc I don't remember) was silent, and lived on the campus in a tent for the semester. My Uncle said that him and his friends would take time out of their day to watch the student. \n\nI've brought this up to some of my friends, but no current students have heard of this. \n\nAs I said, I would love if anyone had more information, or to tell me that this doesn't exist and my legs being pulled.",

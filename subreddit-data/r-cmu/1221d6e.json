    "postText": "Hi all! I recently got admitted this morning (much to my own surprise haha) to CMU SCS.\n\nI'm OOS but was offered the CMU Undergraduate Grant, but it is still quite expensive. The acceptance fee of $800 is crazy hahahah\n\nOn the other hand, I was rejected from Georgia Tech for the 23/24 school year, but I was offered the Talent Initiative Pathway Program, where I would do my gen ed courses at UF (in-state, quite cheap) and would have a guaranteed transfer into Georgia Tech CS major.\n\nI am interested in CS with a focus on AI but I am just worried for the high expenses that CMU is asking for... do you guys have any thoughts? I'm just torn atm and would like some other opinions.\n\nThank you so much !!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Hi guys TYSM for all the info I appreciate it :D I am also wondering about the levels of stress hahaha.. since the #1 thing I hear about CMU is the insane stress levels. Is GT and CMU similar in terms of levels of stress / workload? ",

BTW the $800 is a deposit (ie its an early payment on your tuition not an additional fee). Personally I feel like the extra money was worth it but depends on the difference in price. Depending on your current ability to pay it may generally be infeasible, but **IF** you can swallow the upfront cost, some small student loans should be manageable if you build good money habits and get a fairly average new grad offer.",

If it is only for the 1 year then I probably could not keep up with the costs for the other 3 years.",

If CMU ends up being too expensive after the first year/you don't enjoy it, you can just transfer as long as you meet the reqs. After all, one of your comments mentioned that the cost of CMU for this first year is reasonable.\n\nFor reference, I didn't get into CMU and will prob be transferring to GT under pathway so perhaps I'm not the best person to give advice but that's just my two cents.",

    "postText": "I am a PhD student at the CMU Pittsburgh campus. I am going to be staying in bay area for 2 months in the summer. I wanted a place to work from (fall back is to just WFH). \n\nAre CMU Pittsburgh students allowed to enter the SV campus? Is there library style office space in the CMU SV campus that is generally available? Do they have monitors for connecting to laptop? (I am guessing campus should be mostly vacant due to folks interning)\n\nAlternatively I am considering Stanford libraries (they do have fee based entry), but parking there might be an issue. Any thoughts?",

CMU SV campus is part of the NASA campus, so you need CMU id card and a valid government ID card just to enter the NASA campus (valid government ID since it\u2019s a federal property?)\n\nCMU just had one building in the NASA campus, and the doors are access control locked. When normal school was in session, we could enter in without ever having to badge but since it\u2019s summer semester, you might\u2019ve to badge in. Since you were from Pittsburgh campus, I do not think, you would be in the list of people who will be allowed to badge in. You should send them a mail so they can add you to the list. They might need your id card for that.\n\nThey have meeting rooms that you can book. Not sure is that what you\u2019re looking for, when you say office space. I would suggest bring the expectations down a little since library in CMU Pittsburgh is bigger than the whole SV campus, haha!",

You have to drive, so you kind of need a reason to be there as well as permission. \n\nVery cool campus if you happen to be there when it\u2019s open for a tour, though. Once a decade or so.",

I suspect you can get permission, but definitely contact them in advance.  Again, information a few years old, but library-style space is expecting too much.  A shared table and chair and a fairly extensive vending kiosk, sure, but if you\u2019re expecting much more than that like a monitor, definitely ask in advance about it.",

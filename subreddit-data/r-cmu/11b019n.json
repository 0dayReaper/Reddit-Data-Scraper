            "comment": "I'm in the class right now. Reviewing the lecture slides has been really helpful. It's been helpful also to have them open while doing the homeworks - when I miss something on the hw, I usually realize that the answer was something that I overlooked from the slides.\n\nStudying basic graph theory independently of the course may be helpful. I learned some via 21-228, and it's useful for intuition and especially for understanding how to correctly do induction proofs on graphs. Practicing more with big-O notation and learning some basic complexity theory would also help, as would reviewing 15-122 info on data structures.",

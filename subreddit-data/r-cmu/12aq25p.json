    "postText": "I'm about to accept an offer for MSCS from CMU. Since my eventual goal is to work in a big tech company research lab as an AI researcher, would it be possible to do so after graduating from master's or are PhD studies essential for such kind of roles? Do you guys know any MSCS alumni who managed to get a similar job?",

I would like to apply for a master in artificial intelligence at Carnegie. However, I don't understand the differences between the two following master's programs :\n\n\\-  [https://msaii.cs.cmu.edu/](https://msaii.cs.cmu.edu/) (MSc in AI)\n\n\\- [https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/primary-ms-machine-learning-masters.html](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/primary-ms-machine-learning-masters.html) (Primary master in ML)\n\nWhat is the \"\"best\"\" for you in my case ? I would like to do research and a PhD after that.\n\nThanks to you",

            "comment": "MSML is the more traditional standard ML master's program at CMU. Quite well regarded in industry and academia, and definitely the better option if you are 100% sure about PhD. The cohort is on average very strong, however most CMU master's programs do seem to be diluting over time, from what I know it used to be ridiculously selective, not too sure now as the profiles of students in the program seem more varied with regards to the student backgrounds. It is still one of CMU's prestigious, flagship programs\n\nMSAII is newer, more industry focussed and has a few non-technical courses which are compulsory, although they do not take much time (as per FCEs), however their utility for someone who has no industry/startup inclinations is probably quite minimal. The cohort is generally more varied and the bar for entry is lower from a technical standpoint. MSML is generally more research focussed, and MSAII will have more projects with industry and requires a summer internship in industry.\n\nYou could pretty much take the same courses in both however, as they fall under the MLD/SCS bracket, which gives you enough flexibility. (As compared to Heinz/Tepper etc, which generally have less rigorous versions of the same courses).\n\nGiven your research/PhD ambitions, MSML would be the better fit for you 100%.\n\nIf you are going into industry, I don't think it matters too much, at least when compared to networking and using your CMU connections to get jobs.\n\nHope that helps!",

            "comment": "Besides being in different departments, one key difference is that the MSAII is expected to be a professional masters where the MSML is more research oriented. \n\nMSAII requires an industry internship and capstone, while MSML requires an in depth research project (although an internship can be substituted in some cases). Although some students from MSAII do go on to a PhD program most go out to industry.\n\nFor doing a PhD right after, MSML is likely better, but both are high quality programs that can lead to a PhD.",

            "comment": "To not echo existing comments, regarding MSAII, I think it is a great course for Machine Learning *Engineering* while MSML is probably more catered towards Machine Learning *Research*. As mentioned, you can practically take the same courses ( while accounting for required courses that will differ ) and graduate from either programs. Some core courses in MSAII are very directly related to industry, intrapreneurship, and entrepreneurship, that try to drive the point of user-centric design, presentations, and ML Systems home. Can't speak to MSML since I don't have direct experience there, sorry!",

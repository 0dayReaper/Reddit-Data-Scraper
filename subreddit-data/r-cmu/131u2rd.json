            "comment": "With regards to the Coursera mention, CMU does actually offer a few classes via LinkedIn Learning: [https://www.cmu.edu/web/training/linkedin-learning.html](https://www.cmu.edu/web/training/linkedin-learning.html) , as well as a few other random Content Management courses: [https://www.cmu.edu/web/training/index.html](https://www.cmu.edu/web/training/index.html) There's a bunch of software in general on this page: [https://www.cmu.edu/computing/software/](https://www.cmu.edu/computing/software/) \n\nThere's a few additional benefits that haven't been mentioned yet / aren't specified:\n\n\\- Campus things that normally cost money to use are usually free or at least heavily discounted, e.g. School of Music/ School of Drama events, \"Group X-ercise\", etc. (I know this link is for staff but it's also correct for students/ignore the 'staff council' section: [https://www.cmu.edu/hr/work-life/discounts/culture-sports.html](https://www.cmu.edu/hr/work-life/discounts/culture-sports.html))\n\n\\- Beyond 'the museums' you also get free access to the National Aviary, Phipps Conservatory, and Carnegie Science Center, and a few other things ([https://www.cmu.edu/idplus/services/artspass.html](https://www.cmu.edu/idplus/services/artspass.html)). You can also get discounted tickets for many things, e.g. the Symphony ([https://www.pittsburghsymphony.org/pso\\_home/web/subscriptions/group-student/university-discount/cmu](https://www.pittsburghsymphony.org/pso_home/web/subscriptions/group-student/university-discount/cmu))\n\n\\- Courtesy of the Libraries, all students get free access to a number of news sources: NYT and USA Today, and others in a more indirect/hard to use method ([https://www.library.cmu.edu/services/journals-newspapers](https://www.library.cmu.edu/services/journals-newspapers)), as well as a ton of databases/e-tools: [https://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php) and pretty much all of the big academic journals that you can think of\n\n\\- Courtesy of Student Health and Wellness (or UHS in general) you can download and use the Headspace mental health app for free. Counseling and Psychological Services are free and confidential for all students ([https://www.cmu.edu/counseling/](https://www.cmu.edu/counseling/)). Additionally, TimelyCare, another digital wellbeing services ([https://www.cmu.edu/wellbeing/resources/timely-care.html](https://www.cmu.edu/wellbeing/resources/timely-care.html))\n\n\\- Courtesy of GSA and Student Senate, you can get a free NYT Games subscription (GSA will send another email out to grad students in the fall so don't miss that, because it's literally just a link/code I don't know of another way to do this yet)\n\n\\- IDK who funds this but you can also get discounted tickets to events in the Cultural District ([https://www.culturaldistrict.org/group-sales/cmu](https://www.culturaldistrict.org/group-sales/cmu))\n\n\\- CMU subscribes to Xfinity on Campus, which is pretty cool -  Go to the site here ([https://xfinityoncampus.com/home](https://xfinityoncampus.com/home)), select \"Carnegie Mellon University\" and log in with your AndrewID. This only works over the CMU network.\n\n\\- GSA (and the administration) also sponsors a number of other things, such as:\n\n* Family Care Concierge ([https://www.cmu.edu/hr/work-life/support/family-child-care-resources/concierge.html](https://www.cmu.edu/hr/work-life/support/family-child-care-resources/concierge.html))\n* Care@Work for backup child and adult care ([https://www.cmu.edu/hr/work-life/support/family-child-care-resources/care-at-work.html](https://www.cmu.edu/hr/work-life/support/family-child-care-resources/care-at-work.html))\n* a free Legal Consultation ([https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/resources/legal-consultation.html](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/resources/legal-consultation.html) \\- really popular, book in advance)\n\nThere's a number of other things I'm forgetting but I'll update this post as I look! And feel free to reach out to me at [gsa-vpca@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:gsa-vpca@andrew.cmu.edu) (or [gsa@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:gsa@andrew.cmu.edu) in general) with any questions or comments!\n\nOther links:\n\n* [https://metals.hcii.cmu.edu/student-resources/cmu-id-card-benefits/](https://metals.hcii.cmu.edu/student-resources/cmu-id-card-benefits/)\n* [https://www.cmu.edu/wellbeing/resources/people.html](https://www.cmu.edu/wellbeing/resources/people.html)\n* [https://www.cmu.edu/hr/news/2022/08-10-mental-health.html](https://www.cmu.edu/hr/news/2022/08-10-mental-health.html)\n* [https://www.cmu.edu/wellbeing/resources/therapy.html](https://www.cmu.edu/wellbeing/resources/therapy.html)\n* [https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/Resources-for-Graduate-Students/index.html](https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/Resources-for-Graduate-Students/index.html)",

There's a lot of internal processes that need to be updated so we can get information out there easier.\n\nBut yes this is a great idea, thank you!",

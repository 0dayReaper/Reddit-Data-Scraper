The \"operations research\" part of IE is in mathematics (as a BS concentration) and in Tepper (as part of their business analytics concentration). For the full IE experience, CMU is not the place.  You might cobble together something with, say, mechanical engineering along with some well chosen electives but it won't look like an IE degree.\n\nInformation Systems overlaps with, but is not really similar to an IE degree.",

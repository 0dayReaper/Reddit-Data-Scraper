    "postText": "Hi, I'm wondering if there're any places on campus where I can borrow a 4'x3' landscape poster board? I'm presenting a poster for a previous conference at another event where the poster size is slightly smaller. My poster isn't hard-backed so it'll hang off the one provided unless I find a board to pin my poster to. I really don't want to spend money printing another poster but if needed, where on campus can students print posters and how much do they cost?",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a sophomore trying to take as mini3 this semester so it fulfills the lab req together with my credit from AP Chem. Beside this course I already have 42 credits of course and an independent study. I feel like it\u2019s a little bit too much after one week, but I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ll be busier in future semesters. \nShould I better take it this semester or in the future, any advice?",

The biggest time commitment really was the 3 hours in lab every week, I don\u2019t remember there being any exams or the crazy lab reports like in the higher level chem labs\n\nEdit: I took it with Vuocolo, not sure if he still teaches it now",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m a senior coming to CMU next year and I\u2019ve heard a lot about the workload and stress of the school, especially on this sub. Would you say the workload is comparable to other programs for CS or engineering? I will be doing mechanical engineering. As I know engineering is quite rigorous everywhere, I was wondering if the reputation comes from CMU being a highly stem based school or if the programs are intrinsically different. Also, any tips for managing work and fun + any recommendations for things to do for fun freshman year?\n\nThanks!",

For me and many other meche freshmen, we're putting around 12-25 hours of homework per week. I don't know how comparable the workload and stress is to other schools, but it is definitely stressful at CMU. You'll probably be working up to midnight on a somewhat regular basis.\n\nI manage to party maybe one night a week (fri or sat) and make good grades. Anymore than that, your grades will suffer as weekends are the prime time to do work",

Most sports, carnegie mellon racing, scotch n soda, ethnic orgs, etc.) I was pretty surprised that the stem/engineering clubs threw parties. Most weekends for me, its small dorm parties with my friends (like 4-8 people).",

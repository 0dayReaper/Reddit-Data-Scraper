    "postText": "Yesterday, CMU's Office of Admissions emailed me saying I was missing my teacher's letter of recommendation. However, she's submitted it 2x through the Common App and emailed it to them as well. Has anyone else experienced this and what can I do to solve this? \nAlso, what's the deadline? I'm assuming if they emailed me yesterday then I still have a week or so to submit it but the other sources I've found say that it should've been sent over a month ago.",

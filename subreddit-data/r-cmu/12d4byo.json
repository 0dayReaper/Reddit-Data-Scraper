Currently a sophomore in high school and got waitlisted for this Computer Science Scholars Program. But I also applied to there Summer Session and Computation Biology program for my 2nd and 3rd choice. Do any of yall know how to see your decision for these results?",

My other friends were rejected from AP/EA and pushed into SAMS bc of it\n\nI'm actually blown away at how many programs they added and how diverse the options are. If I remember correctly there were only 3-4 programs when I did it, theater, APEA, and SAMS, maybe another program for CS I'm forgetting since they had us all on different campuses",

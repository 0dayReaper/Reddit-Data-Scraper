    "postText": "I really want a single at CMU, but I know there aren't a lot of them available so it's obviously not guaranteed. But if I do end up in a double, I'd want a roommate I've gotten to know already rather than someone chosen completely random. If I find someone I'd be comfortable with rooming with, what should I do if I still want a single the most?",

The only exception to this is if you have a medical need, in which case talk to housing. You can\u2019t make a roommate group with someone and then go for a single, so you have to decide before you apply.",

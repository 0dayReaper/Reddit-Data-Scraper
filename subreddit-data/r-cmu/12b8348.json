A bit concerned about 21-127, I wonder what is the best way to prepare for it. I understand that there's a book called \"an infinite descent into pure mathematics.\" Should I give it a read in the summer? Alternatively, should I take a look at [this video series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxersk8fUxiUMSIx0DBqsKZS)?",

Having taken all of them, together you\u2019ll be dedicating at least 50 hours per week to them and that is if you don\u2019t get stuck having to debug code or having to go to OH. Make your freshman semester be a bit less harsh for yourself.",

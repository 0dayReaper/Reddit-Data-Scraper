    "postText": "Has anyone taken 15-418/15-618 Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming? How much of a time commitment is it? I also looked at rate my professor for Professor Railing, who will be teaching the course, and it's making me a bit nervous that he has pretty bad reviews, albeit for the 15-213 course.",

            "comment": "I took 418 about two years ago with bpr and Nathan Beckmann and quite liked it. The course material is a bit more interesting if you haven't had a ton of other systems exposure (imo) because otherwise it is a bit of an amalgam of things you might tangentially touch on in other contexts, and if there's enough overlap here you might not really get a full \"12 units\" worth of knowledge out of it.\n\nThe assignments are alright, with a very reasonable workload, although I didn't feel like I got a ton out of the 3rd/4th one, which was basically \"just do the same thing twice with OpenMP and MPI\". \n\nThe project component is fairly well done and provides a pretty good opportunity to explore applications of course concepts in domains you're interested in.\n\nI have not found ratemyprofessor to be useful or generally representative of my experience with almost any professor at CMU.",

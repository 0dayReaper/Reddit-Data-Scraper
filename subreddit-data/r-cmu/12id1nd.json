Wanted to try my luck and see if anyone else is going there and would be interested in being roommates \u2014 because boy LA rent is expensive. \n\nI know this is a long shot but I thought I\u2019d give it a try :)) please DM me if you\u2019re interested! I\u2019m a 22F, no preference on roommates gender.",

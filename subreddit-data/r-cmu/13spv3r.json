    "postText": "Today I just saw that we have a task due 5/31 to set up email and personal tech.\n\nI'm able to log into my CMU Andrew email account. Does this mean I've already finished setting up my email?\n\nAs for tech... I'm leaving tomorrow for a trip and I still need to finish packing. I'm coming home ON the 31st. I also am not bringing the computer I'm currently using to CMU, and the one I plan on bringing isn't yet ready for use. To say it shortly, I'm not able to do the check, and even if I could I don't have the time to.\n\nDoes anyone know if this 31st due date is a hard due date or if it's just a guide? Should I start getting worried?",

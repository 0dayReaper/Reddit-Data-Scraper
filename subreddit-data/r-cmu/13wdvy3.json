As someone on another thread put it, \u2018you have to commit war crimes to get rescinded.\u2019 Doesn\u2019t sound like you have, you\u2019re good.\n\nWith that said, I would worry though about your level of preparedness for CMU classes. With those grades, it\u2019s possible that you missed critical material, in which case I would just be prepared to self-learn some stuff so academics don\u2019t run you over like a truck.",

CMU does not commonly rescind people unless they have multiple Ds, failing grades, or have other violations on their record. Unless you're failing or a criminal, the most you'll get is an email asking you to explain what happened.",

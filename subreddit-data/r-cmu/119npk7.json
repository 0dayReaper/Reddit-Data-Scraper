I\u2019ve been spending hours looking over the 15213 slides and the handout for cachelab and I have no idea what the fuck is going on; I literally don\u2019t understand shit. This is the last straw for me. I\u2019ve been toughing out CS classes for the last two years in the hopes that it might get better somewhere done the line, but it hasn\u2019t. \n\nI think I\u2019ve accepted that this school has honestly made me despise coding and computer science, but I\u2019m already two years in and I have nowhere else to go. I\u2019m having a panic attack since there\u2019s no way I can pass this class given that the rest of the labs are even worse. I really don\u2019t know what to do or where to go at this point.\n\nI wish I could restart my life all over and pick a different school and major.",

Can you talk to someone at office hours?\n\nAlso, uh, you do not have to quietly suffer through panic attacks. It\u2019s possible to get help for things like that, whether through CAPS or other mental health support.",

Turn them into a list and give each of the suggestions a go and reflect on what works and doesn\u2019t.  But take a break. Do something away from CMU if you can.

I started school as BXA with CS, but realized my heart just wasn't in the work when I was looking at having to retake 251 again. \n\nI ended up being able to salvage pretty much all the credits I'd already gotten and graduate with a student defined major that qualified as \"within the school of computer science,\" and honestly, people generally just equate it to \"CS major\" in the real world.\n\nNot saying you can't do a classic CS major - you've got this!! But I wish I'd realized there were different options sooner. I didn't talk to my advisor nearly as much as I wish I had, early on.",

In most of industry, people aren't working on building the fundamental components, but building on top of libraries that someone else built. It's great if you can understand it, but it's unlikely you'll have to do it very often, and probably never on your own.\n\nHack the system. Keep taking the class until the withdraw deadline so you can learn as much as you can, then drop it and go back in next semester with less to learn.",

The point is that these classes teach you how to think in completely new ways and that can be really frustrating and depressing.  I was a TA for 15-213 twice and saw many many people struggle.  There are some things I would have liked to change about the course but the professors are very stuck on teaching the course  the same way for two decades.",

            "comment": "Hi - current student here.\n\nCachelab can definitely be one of the most conceptually challenging parts of 15-213. I would highly recommend going to office hours, and especially the professor office hours if you can. The professors often find that their OHs are fairly empty, and would love to have students come in and ask questions. It doesn't have to be debugging questions that you bring to a professor; they would be more than happy to help with conceptual questions.\n\nIf you ask a TA to sit down with you and discuss the course content one on one, I think they would be more than happy to, speaking from experience. Your recitation TAs should be your best resources as they are your primary point of contact besides the professor.\n\nStay strong - you were admitted into CS because you belong in the program. College isn't about grades, so focus on learning and you'll get a lot more out of your experience here :)",

Again, some of friends like systems classes and even doing a systems concentration, while they were less fan of the theory heavy courses.\n\nI have seen other comments highlighting how to make your 15213 experience better, for which I'm not adding anything to it. You have already completed 15210 and 15251 by your sophomore year, which proves you are 'smart' enough to complete a major in CS from CMU. But if you have firmly decided to switch out of CS, you have options open for that as well. In this case, I would recommend Information Systems. \nInformation Systems at CMU is world class and super flexible. It is definitely possible to complete this major on time even if you switch now. An IS major with a possible CS minor from CMU would definitely be a great fit.",

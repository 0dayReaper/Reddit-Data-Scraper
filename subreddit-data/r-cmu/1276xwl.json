    "postText": "I recently went to Chestnut Hills Squirrel Hill for routine teeth cleaning. I purchased the university blue dental insurance, and it guaranteed two free dental cleaning per year for in network dental services. Chestnut Hills Squirrel Hill is in the network for the dental insurance.\n\nHowever, when I visited the dentist, the dentist told me that I would need deep cleaning, though my teeth were actually perfectly fine. She told me that they were not clean enough and needed deep cleaning, and insisted that it was necessary. I asked how much it would charge, and she confirmed me that it would charge 234 USD after insurance. I said ok. However, it was not deep cleaning at all, with no anesthetic, it took only 20 mins to finish, which has no difference from routine cleaning. I chose to let it go.\n\nHowever, later I received an additional 850 USD bill from the dentist, telling me that this was not at all covered by the insurance. I asked why, and they basically said it was not. They also said that they gave me the wrong quote, even with insurance, it should be 458 USD instead of 234 USD. But it would not go through insurance. I said this was a fraud, and they said by using their company's policy is that, the price was estimated. But in their patient agreement that I signed, there were no such words at all. If the price can be manipulated anyway, how can we use medical services at all?\n\nI contacted the insurance company, but they just resent the same bill, even if in their handbook, it said cleaning would cover 80% for any kind of cleaning ([https://www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/pdfs/cmu-student-dental-book.pdf](https://www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/pdfs/cmu-student-dental-book.pdf)).\n\nThe staff and dentist there were also not friendly in communication as well. For example, when I asked the price, the dentist just said sarcastically, \"Oh, other people will not ask the price and do it immediately.\"",

They\u2019ll ask you if you want more and then put it down as something else to charge you more or they\u2019ll say that you have a problem when you don\u2019t. This might be bad, but I\u2019ve always denied any additional service with my first appointment at a dentist.",

Their office sent my husband\u2019s bill to collections even though we called them five times to get them to put it through his insurance (and they never did, even though they had done it for prior visits). They kicked him out of the practice for the bill and I was honestly relieved even though we had to find new dentists.",

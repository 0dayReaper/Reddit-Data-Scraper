    "postText": "Grad student here. Never worked on Java projects before though I've taken a few system courses here and in undergrad (they are mostly in C or Cpp). Had to say this project 2 ckpt 3 is the most painful one for me. I am already spending the first grace day rn. I know the concepts, but I just find it so hard to keep everything together. I've done well in the tests and the hws, but all the projects are just way too painful for me. Damn it. I am feeling so dumb right now.",

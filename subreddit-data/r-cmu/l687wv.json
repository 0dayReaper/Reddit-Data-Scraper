    "postText": "I did a COVID test on campus this morning. The person who did my test was annoyed about CMU's instructions telling people not to eat or drink for 30 minutes before their COVID tests. This is causing people's tests to be rejected.\n\n**30 minutes is not long enough!**\n\nI overheard the person in the stall next to me, who was told that their test would probably be rejected because their saliva was discolored. They said they drank coffee over an hour ago and nothing since then.\n\nI asked the person who did my test, and they said that if you eat or drink anything other than water, you need to **rinse your mouth out with water and wait at least an hour**, maybe even longer, before your saliva is OK for the COVID test.\n\nHopefully CMU will update their instructions because a lot of tests are being wasted.",

    "postText": "I'm considering dropping 251 not because of difficulty issues (I don't need the course to graduate and can use a drop voucher), but primarily because it seems like I could be getting close to the same experience doing proof-based math problems on my own. Or just looking at the textbook, they use and doing the exercises. Maybe it's just because it's week one, but I feel like this class is only for people who are required to take it to be like \"hey, I have taken this class, pls allow me to enter another class.\"   \n\n\nJust want to make sure that reasoning's correct. Is there REALLY something special that I'm missing that every hypes this class up for?",

            "comment": "I do think you may be missing something here. I've talked to a multitude of SCS undergraduates whose hardest course was 15-251, even after having been seniors and taken 400 level and grad level courses. It definitely does start to ramp up as time goes on, and I definitely can see where structural induction and week 1 content can seem very approachable.\n\nI would say one of the major benefits of this course compared to any CS course I've seen at CMU is the quality of the teaching staff and instructor. It's really apparent how much time and effort Anil puts into the course.\n\nI also wouldn't say this course is just a proof-based maths course, as I think it's really something different than 21-269 or 21-355. At heart it's still a CS theory course and while not 100% necessary depending on what you want to do, understanding P vs NP, randomized and approximation algorithms defined rigorously, and some graph theory can be really valuable (at least it has been for me).\n\nThe only other thing I'd think to say is that the textbook exercises don't give the course justice -- there are some quite cool problems on the writing sessions, especially some of the opens and bonus problems.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't be too quick to judge. And also try and talk to Ada if he has an office hour -- it's a lot of fun and I'm sure he'll have something interesting to say :)",

If you're confident in learning accurately from textbooks, and don't feel like having classmates and professors to guide you is needed, then it's not unreasonable to drop i think.",

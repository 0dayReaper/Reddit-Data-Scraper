    "postText": "When I first started here 2x years I found myself feeling similar to many people who post on this reddit, \"that CMU has ruined my love for Computer Science\". The immense workload, the difficulty of assignments, the stress, the fact that no one really understands what you're going through (family, friends, employers, even people at many other CS programs don't know what it's like)......these things all add up. And in the face you of that you have to raise your head back up and tackle every assignment with every amount of effort within you over and over and over and over again.\u00a0\n\nAs my last semester here comes to a close in the next couple of weeks, I realize now that I actually love wholeheartedly every struggle and stress I've encountered here. There has been so many times when I thought, \"this is it, this is the lab that I'm gonna fail\". Some of them I figured it out, some I didn't. But with all of them, I walked away a much stronger person than I was before.\u00a0\n\nMaybe its the joyful nature around campus right now with the return of Spring Carnival...or maybe it's the fact that I've come to terms with what CMU's about...or perhaps both...but regardless of the reason, I find myself starting to love CMU a little. I'm glad to have gone through this struggle with all of you. I would definitely choose CMU SCS over any other option again if I had the choice.",

Halfway through my career and it still feels like I've been breezing through on easy mode.\n\nPlenty of developers are confident in what they already know and expand their comfort zone slowly. But CMU alum are confident in being able to figure out what they don't know. We don't need a comfort zone.\n\nAndrew Carnegie's personal motto may have been *My heart is in the work*. But the university's motto really should be *Dolor hic tibi proderit olim* (this pain will be useful to you someday).",

If so, how did you cope with it?\n\nI don't know, the whole pipeline seems kind of disappointing now that I'm on the other end of it: get accepted to CMU, work really hard for a few years and learn about some really interesting concepts with really motivated peers, get a well-paying position at a great company, and then... what? Become ever more efficient at playing office politics and building internal APIs at FaceGoog to rise from L3 to L4 to L5? What is the endgame?\n\nMaybe it's just rose-colored glasses/Stockholm syndrome but I'm starting to wish I was back in \"hard mode\".",

Set a goal to learn a new language, revisit other high-school subjects, go to research conferences, go back to grad school, improve family relationships, discover or question your faith(s), minmax your TC, fat FIRE, travel the world, or whatever really. Undergrad is just 4 years out of say 70 years alive; you have plenty of time left to work at whatever you set your mind to.",

And for better or worse, I have always been the type to rise to the occasion and pull off my best results when there's a lot on the line. Conversely, it's difficult for me to motivate myself to do anything nontrivial without a carrot in front of me or -- even better -- a stick behind me.\n\nYou've mentioned a lot of great and interesting pursuits, though. Hopefully I will be able to manually re-engage hard mode to pursue some of them at some point.",

There are a lot of reading groups online that try to follow university-level material, e.g., Keenan's computer graphics group has a discord server which seems reasonably active, Pittsburgh had a bunch of tech meetups pre-covid that were pretty friendly for things like functional programming and Rust, if you're into databases Alex Petrov had an open slack for the Database Internals book which is pretty good too. It won't be quite the same, but you can recreate a similar \"classroom\" experience in this way.\n\nIf you haven't watched Avatar, you may want to skip this paragraph for mild spoilers. There's a part where a certain character lost touch with their \"bending\" ability due to a sudden loss of the ambition and anger that drove it, but they regained a better form of their ability by learning to view it through a healthier lens. I've often thought that this was somewhat applicable to the typical would-be high-achieving student -- we grind so much to get in here and out of here that our ability is built up in an unhealthy and externally-motivated way, and it takes time and conscious effort to relearn and adapt to a healthier form of practice. At this point, I'm just procrastinating by rambling on reddit, but I hope you find a way to do things and appreciate what you're doing without the need for carrot nor stick.\n\nThough there's definitely no harm in taking a break for an indefinite amount of time either. I personally find that the itch to do something comes back after enough inactivity. :) Either way, good luck and hope you enjoy employed life!",

There's many times where you have to devise a solution to something and you have no idea if you're even going in remotely the right direction......but at some point you have to pick a plan and be fully confident with it (even if it may fail).....because if you're not fully confident or committed you won't be able to think the problem through.

When things are difficult and scary, the last thing I want to do is give up and stay there under all that stress. You have to find a way to get through it.\n\nAnd sure, I still get imposter syndrome sometimes. But for the most part, I know I can figure out a solution. I'm not a college student, broke, starving and sleep deprived. I make good money and eat and sleep every day. Work is just work.

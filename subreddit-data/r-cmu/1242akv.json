    "postText": "I\u2019m currently a CS major and thinking about transferring to Tepper to study business instead, and I\u2019d really appreciate any advice (I\u2019m pretty ignorant about this type of stuff)\n\nDoes the average business grad earn enough to pay off a significant amount of student loans and live decently in a big city if they land a job in something like UX design or Product Management? Or if they get a job as a consultant or analyst? \n\nI saw that the avg CMU business grad reported salary is around 83k, but the CMU tool doesn\u2019t show how much specific jobs pay. Sorry if these are dumb questions",

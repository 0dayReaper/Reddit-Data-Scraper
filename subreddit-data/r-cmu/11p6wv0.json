    "postText": "Hey all, I\u2019m an international student currently working as an sde at microsoft india. I got the admit for mse for professionals program, and I\u2019m very happy to be getting into an scs program! But i did not get any funding, and the tuition fee seems too high. The professionals track doesn\u2019t allow internship and it has a studio project instead, and TA roles dont pay much compared to the fee. I understand that an experienced candidate wont benefit much from an internship and hence the program structure without it, but I\u2019m not able to make an estimate as of now if going for 16 months with no pay would be worth the risk after graduation.\n\nThe other admits i have are cmu mism and udub msim. I\u2019m waiting for umass mscs, but pretty much no hopes at this point.\n\nCan anyone who has an idea about the ROI give some insights?",

            "comment": "As a former student of CMU's Masters in Software Engineering program, I'd like to share my experience with you. I have to warn you that the program is very expensive and the quality of education is average, despite the fact that it may seem appealing given the reputation of the School of Computer Science. It was even harder for me to justify the expenditure because I wasn't given any funding either.  \nGiven how important real-world experience is to the field of software engineering, the lack of internship opportunities in the professional track is a major disadvantage. The studio project does not offer the same level of exposure to real-world issues and solutions as an internship, making it an inadequate substitute.  \nI would advise considering alternative options, such as the MS in CS, DA or Statistics, in terms of return on investment. These programs could give you a better return on your investment and more chances to gain a good internship experience.  \nYou should think carefully about the cost and quality of education before making a choice. There are other options to consider that may provide better value for your investment and the MSE program may not be the best choice for everyone.",

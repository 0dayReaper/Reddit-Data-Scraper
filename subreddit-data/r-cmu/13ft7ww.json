    "postText": "Hi! I'm a non-CMU student who will be living in the Highlands Apartments this summer through CMU's summer intern housing program, but I'm not sure what the best option for parking would be. On CMU's website, I saw that they offer summer parking leases for East Campus Garage, the Greek Quad Lot, and Dithridge Street Garage. Which of these options would be the most convenient? Or is there another parking option I should consider? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",

The CMU summer intern housing website said that parking isn\u2019t coordinated through them, so I was under the assumption that the Highlands Apartments don\u2019t have parking, but correct me if I\u2019m wrong.",

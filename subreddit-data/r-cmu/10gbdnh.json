    "postText": "im taking 15122, 21241, and 21120 this sem and got a B in 21127 in the last summer. Would that be enough prep for 15251 if i plan to take it next sem? \n\nalso would that be feasible if i take 251 with 213 and probability (36225?)\n\nand how useful is 21259 for a non-but want to be-cs major? \n\n(i only have one year left and i will be finishing my music thesis next spring so this two sem are crucial for me to take cs classes",

            "comment": "it would be feasible. 251 is not necessarily too difficult of a class (overhyped imo). 21259 is not a really useful class simply because of how poorly it\u2019s taught here at CMU; I would take 21266 instead of 259. Similar concepts except you also cover matrix calculus but is also a much better taught class.",

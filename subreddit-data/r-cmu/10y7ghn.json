That's fairly regular, but what adds interest is that it ended in exposed wire on both ends and had a sign that said \"Do Not Lick\" above it.  (He'd removed part of the wire but left the insulation in place...so it looked insanely dangerous but there was no way to complete the circuit.)  \n\n\nCorrection: Talked to the owner of the website.  Big sign was something else, and the wires had spoons on the end that said \"Do Not Touch Spoons\". Time plays tricks with memory.",

I know carnegie mellon has prestige to its name and the job opportunities are good but we can barely afford 83k. Would love to hear your guys\u2019 thoughts.",

The vast majority of people don\u2019t even make $83k a year let alone have that much to spend on college, so how could we answer if it\u2019s worth it? Only you can make that decision.\n(I\u2019m saying this because I come from a background of significant privilege and even I get aid so I know you have a ridiculous amount of money.)",

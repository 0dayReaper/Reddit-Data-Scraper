Apart from class, research, part-time work, or an internship, tf are yall doing this summer if you're stuck near/on campus?\n\nI'm bored as fuck. Msg me if you wanna try playing spike ball, tennis, table tennis, volleyball, or anything really, I'll try anything out. (If you got a group already, lmk) I'm pretty ass at sports in general but I'm down to learn/get better this summer). Looking for a gym buddy too to force myself to get in shape.\n\nOr honestly, if you wanna just grab food or something I'm down too.",

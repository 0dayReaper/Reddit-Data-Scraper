    "postText": "I always put 82279- Anime: Visual interplay between Japan and the world on my course schedule somewhat as a joke, never expecting to get in because it fills up after the very first day of registration usually, and it was the same case this year, but by some miracle it allowed me to register anyways. Is it actually a good course? I honestly want an easy A for a PPC gen Ed so I'm between this and the Beatles course. Any advice would be appreciated!",

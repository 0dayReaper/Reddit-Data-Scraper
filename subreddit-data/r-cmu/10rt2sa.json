I especially enjoy the idea of unspoken love through the act of giving someone a blanket.\n\n  \nIf you could share with me a thought or make a poem, I will be including these in my book/zine that will then be put into a 50 cent book vending machine.   \nif you aren't able to produce a poem or thought... I'm sure an ai can help you. \n\n  \nthank you!",

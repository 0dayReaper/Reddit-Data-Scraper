    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture. After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.\n\nOne day long ago, a group of students took a nice Saturday off and went to the UC building for swimming sessions. Now, the pool at the time was huge, with the intent for the various types of aquatic sport training. One could indeed practice for Olympic dreams and not feel constrained. Blame it on being focused on their lap times but the swimmers that day never bothered to look down at the wall along the far wall. Had they done so, the ladies present in the pool might have gasped for there were several archie faces having a good time peering through small windows. How did they end up there?\n\nWell, to start, almost everyone knows about the steam tunnels. Before any student finishes orientation week, rumors and legends are shared about that mysterious labyrinth beneath campus providing heat during the harsh winters in the steel city. By the first month, that same student will have heard the [tale of the unknown kid that lived for a semester or two in those deep dark tunnels](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/n7f60a/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_3_the_steam_punk/), undoubtedly retold as someone from their own school, be it engineering, architecture, or computer science.\n\nWhat people don\u2019t know is just how connected everything is via those steam tunnels. Were it not for the fact that trespassing there warranted a semester in exile, people could theoretically traverse from one building to any other without the need to be outdoors in the cold. This makes sense when one considers the intent of the steam tunnels to provide heat to all buildings. However, where exactly those tunnels end isn\u2019t always as logical.\n\nIndeed, as retold by some senior colleagues to those of us who never ventured into the tunnels, there was a branch of the tunnel that stopped right beside UC pool and was granted light via some thick watertight windows. The quickest way to access that branch started all the way back in the Maggie Mo lower basement level. Apparently, archies used to walk past the double doors and make their way into that space via the steam tunnels, not to peep at swimmers but to relax and get away from their studio projects in a calm still space beside the water. It was a fun little pastime for them until campus security implemented a system of security cameras at all entrances to the steam tunnels. Until the administrative killjoys cracked down on such explorations with a semester long ban, you could have said the UC swimmers had their own underground spectators cheering them on between studio assignments.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d",

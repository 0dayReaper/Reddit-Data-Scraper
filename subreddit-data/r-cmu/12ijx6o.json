    "postText": "Recently I was admitted into CMU-Q for Business Administration, but I want to double major also in Information Systems. Cmuq itself is selective (4.7% this year) and I know that cmu is considered as a really good school in the US. + they give really good financial aid and I couldn\u2019t afford going to cmu main campus anyways. But I have huge concerns if the quality of education and career prospects after graduation are the same as in Pittsburg (also networking and basically sense of belongingness to the cmu student community). There is not a lot of info on these questions and cmuq in general anywhere, so I would be really grateful if cmu students who had experience with cmuq or just heard about it replied here!",

            "comment": "I was a CMU Pittsburgh campus ECE student, and took a CS class over Zoom hosted at CMU-Q over covid. At least for the CS classes, they're just as rigorous (and hard!) as the classes in the Pittsburgh campus. In fact it was arguably even better, because there were just 4 students in the class so it was actually a two way dialogue for all classes, instead of one way lectures. I can't speak for the business administration side, but I'm very confident they're more than comparable to the classes offered here in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe possible downsides are:\n\n* The variety of classes are limited. Not all classes are offered in CMU-Q, which can limit the gen-eds or even the electives you take. Some of the classes I enjoyed the most were random gen-eds, such as a US First Amendment law class I took. You can look up the classes offered at all campuses at https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet However, I think the ability to cross register and enroll at the other universities at Qatar education city makes up for it\n* Career options after graduation can also be more limited. I'm assuming you're an international student (i.e. not from the US). International STEM graduates have the ability to work for 3 years in the US after graduation (1 year if you aren't a STEM graduate, but CMU's BA degree *might* qualify, double check on that), which makes it much easier to get hired and remain in the US after graduation. It's harder to move to the US after CMU-Q if that's something you want to do, but it's definitely not impossible either",

Yep I am an international student and also have offers from other us colleges but they turn out more expensive + lower ranked.. but the question of staying in the us is really important and basically rn I have this dilemma of what would value more for my career: cmu diploma but studying in Qatar or studying in T50 but in the us. Anyways you gave me a lot of food for thought, thanks again!",

            "comment": "I went to CMU for my BS in Information Systems in Pittsburgh for my undergrad, taking many courses in Tepper related to a minor as well. Granted this was in 2014 and the country has rapidly changed, but I also had the chance to study at CMU-Q for a semester abroad, again taking multiple IS and Tepper courses. I would say the quality of the education is exactly the same, with the school amenities, sense of community, and teacher-to-student focus being all better at the Doha campus than in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe only disadvantage I noticed from CMU-Q (apart from enjoying living in Pittsburgh more than Doha if I had to choose a place to live for 4 years) was the amount of course options and majors available but that's just a biproduct of the campus being much smaller. Those I know who graduated from CMUQ had similar career outcomes to those from the main campus and as far as I remember you get the exact same degree, so you should be able to just list graduating from Carnegie Mellon University on your resume if you are truly concerned. I think the school holds the same prestige in the region regardless.",

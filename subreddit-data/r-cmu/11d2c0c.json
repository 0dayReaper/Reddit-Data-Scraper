I\u2019d say the best option would be to export your Drive data using Google Takeout, which you would request access to via the Google Workspace Email Tools site.\n\nThat being said, if you don\u2019t take any action with your Drive data by the time your Andrew account expires, it won\u2019t actually be deleted (as of writing, anyway \u2013 this could change in the future). You could always request a temporary reactivation of your Andrew account from the Computing Services Help Center for the purpose of accessing your Google Drive information again.",

    "postText": " We all know how stressful this school is, and all too often it pushes people too far that they feel they have to end their life. Just because the school never reports any of the suicides that happen to keep their reputation clean, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not occurring. Please remember to take care of yourselves outside of school and reach out when you need help, since this place doesn\u2019t care enough to offer it themselves.",

No school is allowed to divulge this information due to privacy laws, but the information always gets to the local press. I assure you there is no cover up at CMU or any university.\n\nCMU has several options to help you if you are having mental health issues, and I encourage you to pursue them. CMU, like all colleges, does not have the personnel or facilities to treat severe depression but there are multiple hospitals nearby highly experienced in the evaluation and treatment of mental health emergencies. Please dial 988 if you need help. They will guide you to where you need to be.",

I\u2019ve spent years at this school, and have personally known of multiple instances of this happening, and it never has been acknowledged by the school or local media. University mental health resources are severely insufficient to the students needs, and the overall stress culture cultivated throughout the university is the main reason that so many students here struggle. If you don\u2019t see that, you must be severely disconnected from the actual happenings on campus.",

I'm guessing you're angry, possibly because grades just came out, but please don't take out your frustration on Reddit by making things up. Seek help. Things will get better.",

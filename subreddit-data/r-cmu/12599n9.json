    "postText": "I just got admissions from both UMich MS in Robotics and CMU MS in ECE and these two schools gave me a hard time deciding which one will be my destination. I want to pursue Ph.D. in robotics/control in the future.\n\nThe Pros for UMich are:\n\n1) The robotics program of UMich is #2 in the state\n\n2) The program is more directly related to my interest field\n\n3) I heard UMich will ask students if they want to pursue Ph.D. in the second semester, so it might be easier to get a Ph.D. at UMich.\n\nThe Cons for UMich are:\n\n1) Ann Arbor is a smaller city compared with Pittsburgh, and I want to change my learning environment to a larger city because my undergraduate school is in a rural area.\n\n2) The reputation of UMich seems less effective compare with CMU.\n\nThe Pros of CMU are:\n\n1. CMU's RI is also very good in robotics-related areas, and I learned I can do research with RI professors as an ECE student.\n2. Pittsburgh is a larger city compared with Ann Arbor.\n3. The alumni network might be better than UMich.\n\nThe Cons of CMU are:\n\n1. It might be harder for me to get admitted to CMU's Ph.D. program compared with UMich.\n2. I heard the workload at CMU is significant.\n\nSorry about the long post, but these two schools really gave me a hard time deciding. Please let me know your thoughts!",

    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture. After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.\n\nFor some archies, the phrase \u201ceasy as riding a bike\u201d brings not calming reassurance but absolute terror. Such was the case for one third year studio long ago. Their professors had arranged a visit to our nation\u2019s capital, Washington D.C., and had filled their itinerary with many activities. Most of it was the usual miles of walking that these visits typically require but as a treat, the professors had included a special bike ride so that their pupils could coast from monument to monument. Their attempt at good will only sparked panic among a quarter of the students, who were quick to object with a deeply embarrassing flaw: they did not know how to ride a bicycle.\n\nTheir faces turned red at this revelation. Some were quick to point out in their defense that in America, not everyone gets a bike for Christmas as a kid and some cultures overseas think nothing of the contraption entirely. To their dismay, the professors presented a simple solution: those kids had a week to learn how.\n\nI can\u2019t quite tell which was more frightful for the kids, either the mad scramble to find someone with a bike they could loan for practice or the act of learning to ride. Like a popular sitcom, many found the bicycle quite intimidating as they toddled around the parking lot and sidewalks, completely petrified and screaming at every near fall. Some wore helmets. Others may have worn knee and elbow pads. All were quite scared of not having their feet on the ground. After some mishaps, they each eventually learned the secret about bicycles: stability came with speed. They soon figured out how to cruise and then how to keep their balance at lower speeds. By the end of the week, most had overcome their phobia of the bike. The few remaining souls that did not get to practice were sweating bullets about the weekend trip. The professors were adamant no one was allowed to miss the bike tour or any part of the itinerary, for that matter.\n\nThus they all went to D.C. and went on the various scheduled architecture tours. When the day and time finally arrived to ride the bicycles, they found it was all for naught. The bike tour had been shut down for over a year and not a single professor had bothered to check. The unacquainted were spared.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d",

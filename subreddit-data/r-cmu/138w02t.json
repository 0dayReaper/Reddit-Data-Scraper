    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman accepted through RD, and I was hoping to get a single room. Since I was a child, I\u2019ve had really sensitive hearing that often caused me to be unable to sleep through the night or take 45min-75min+ on average to fall asleep. When I was younger and shared a room with my sibling/sometimes my mom, I\u2019d get so bothered by any little movement they make that I can\u2019t fall asleep until they are completely still and quiet. Over time, I developed some sort of anxiety over the constant apprehension that I can\u2019t sleep until (essentially), the person I share a room with has fallen asleep. And then I start having anxiety to fall asleep before they start snoring or flipping in bed. As I got older, I could sleep through the night, it just takes forever to fall asleep, which leaves me tired the next morning. And I got frequent headaches (most likely) from bad sleep too. My situation got better when I got my own room. But even then, it\u2019s difficult to sleep unless I have my air filter on, which makes a loud white noise (like air blowing) so any noise caused by my family/neighbors is muffled. I also use ear plugs but they barely work. It still takes ~30 min to fall sleep (where the normal is 15-20). The thought of having to share a sleeping environment with someone causes me a lot of anxiety right now. My situation also normally gets worse if I\u2019m having other stressors in life like academics. I really dont want my CMU education to be ruined because I cant ever have restorative sleep. \n\nI havent gotten any formal diagnosis, but I\u2019m planning on seeing some neurologist/sleep doctor next week. Since I heard that it was difficult to get single room as a freshman, I was wondering if anyone can shed light on what CMU housing has done to accommodate (or not) to sleep disorders or anxiety? Tysm!",

I forget how exactly I went about this as it was 5 years ago but reach out to housing services they will let you know how to submit the documentation.\n\nYou might also want 24/7 quiet hours, there used to be a dorm for that and I imagine there still is. If your doctor states that this is necessary they will accommodate you.",

They have a Housing Accommodation form that I and the doctor that diagnosed me to fill out, describing my condition/diagnosis and why I need housing accommodations. Would that be the medical documentation you\u2019re referring to? Or do they want to look at medical records directly from the clinic?\n\nAlso, with the form being said, should I additionally reach out to her to describe my situation (email or call?)?",

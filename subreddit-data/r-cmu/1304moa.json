I've always gotten every class I wanted, even when I've been on the wait-list.\nDouble majors, additional majors, and minors are very common. The retirements for each are different but usually listed on the website.",

            "comment": "Sometimes students will get waitlisted when there's still space in the class. That's because some seats will be reserved for students who are required / expected to take the course due to their study. This means the wait-list is just artificial to some extent, and it will move later.\n\nAnother reason the waitlist is not a huge concern is that people will often register for more courses than they intend to take, and then drop some courses closer to the end of the semester.\n\nWaitlists are not a serious issue here, and you shouldn't factor that into your calculus for choosing a school. If anything, I've found the courses here to be very accessible to all students of all disciplines, and it's really nice that there's often students from a diverse set of disciplines enrolled in the same classes (or at least some of the larger flagship courses).",

I got waitlisted for all my classes coming into this semester (bc I'm a freshman and I had a 3:45pm registration slot lol) but I got off all the waitlists by the time the semester started. Some classes go waitlist everyone at first and then advisors start taking people off, and some classes have a ton of reservations set aside for specific colleges/majors. For example, 21-325 (probability) has a max enrollment of 35 students for each section and the waitlist for section B is currently 25 people long, but because I'm a math major, if I wanted to enroll in section B right now I can do that without getting on the waitlist.",

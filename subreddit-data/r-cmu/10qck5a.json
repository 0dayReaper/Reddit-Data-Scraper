And now it's on Zillow. You glance over the overview, and there you see it. The man himself.\n\nMike Bupp.\n\nAt first, you don't know who he is. But then, you go into detective mode. You look at the neighboring school Pitt's subreddit to see if anyone has rented from him before.\n\nYikes.\n\nOh no.\n\n\\[All of these posts and comments are coming from r/Pitt and are within a span of a few months to 2 years ago, so they are very recent.

College student housing standards are super low because they'll likely trash the place with parties, so landlords won't bother putting in nice hardware. On top of that college students are price anchored by getting ass blasted with room and board prices from universities, so paying $1k / mo for a room in an 80 year old Pittsburgh shitbox with friends for 1 year is somehow a step up.",

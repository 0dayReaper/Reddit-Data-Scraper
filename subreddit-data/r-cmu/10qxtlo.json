It's fascinating to see how it has progressed.  Below just picks out a few years...\n\n|Year|Tuition|Fees|Room|Board|Total|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2023-4|$62,260|$1,014|$10,400|$7,068|$80,742|\n|2020-1|$57,560|$880|$9,210|$6,340|$73,990|\n|2014-15|$48,030|$756|$7,280|$5,120|$61,186|\n|2009-10|$40,300|$620|$6,060|$4,280|$51,260|\n|2004-5|$30,650|$576|$4,964|$3,590|$39,780|\n|1999-2000|$22,100|$200|$4,105|$2,705|$29,110|\n|1994-95|$17,900|$100|$3,510|$2,170|$23,680|\n|1989-90|$13,000|$80|$2,610|$1,832|$17,522|\n|1982-3|$6,300|$50|$1,670|$1,176|$9,196|\n\nHas the value of the education gone up that much in the same time?  I guess that's a judgment call.\n\nEDIT: I should also add that if you adjust the 1982 tuition total by the inflation rate each year, the 2023-24 total should be $29,692.",

Good luck with that.\n\nThat said, you have a little bit of transparency from public filings, e.g., according to [0], the sender of the email makes $659,795 a year. You may compare this with historical filings (such as [1]) to see how they've given themselves raises over time (e.g., the same sender used to make $412,880 in 2016 -- so about 1.59x in 7 years -- I should note that they were working with fewer responsibilities then, you should go by roles instead of individuals. For a more apples to apples comparison, Farnam took 723k in 2018, 1m in 2019, and 1.3m in 2020, which is a pretty sweet increase -- also, the rounding error in writing down those figures is enough to cover 3-5 grad student stipends).\n\nYou may further amuse yourself by making overlaid charts of executive comp over time vs. professor comp over time (if you find a few profs willing to share) vs. grad student stipends over time (GSA will have info) vs. tuition over time. If you do, I think the campus community may find such charts very amusing too, so you can consider sharing them and/or printing a few posters, perhaps.\n\n\n\n[0] https://nonprofitlight.com/pa/pittsburgh/carnegie-mellon-university  \n[1] https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/250969449/201721319349303822/full",

If this were truly the case, then meal plans should not be mandatory. Parents can always buy their kid one, or send them money monthly, or get them gift cards to franchises, etc.\n\nI think it's telling that lots of people still eat on campus, they just don't get the meal plan. I suspect that if you ran a student poll with just two questions:\n\n- Do you eat on campus?\n- Do you have a meal plan? (if not, why?)\n\nYou would find strong student support for getting rid of the meal plan system entirely. What value does dining services add here? I recognize that they may need to raise money for the overhead of getting someone to negotiate with vendors + point to the captive first-years as leverage of \"you can milk these students\", but at some point, you wonder if we'd be better off without dining services entirely.\n\nFor context, I can buy two to three years of groceries with that \"traditional first-year meal plan\".\n\n(also, some kids are _still_ hungry with the meal plan system, which forces you to commit a lot of money to options that generally aren't that filling. I spent the overwhelming majority of my blocks back then on Schatz and Taste of India for a reason. But I don't expect enough people to relate or care, and we have the food pantry nowadays, so eh.)",

(being able to work part time to put yourself through college, not being buried by debt on graduation, a bachelors degree actually meaning something in the job market, etc). When times are good, everyone tolerates more waste / excess / corruption. But times are a little less good right now, so... :)",

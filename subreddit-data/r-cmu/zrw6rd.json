Helps you destress, be more healthy, and of course look better. I would caution you about approaching people in the gym though - some people just want to be left alone and its hard to tell who's who sometimes. We are both grad students but in different programs, which I think is a smart move. Unfortunately she has to move away for a year so we are going to do the long distance thing.",

I did not want any  architecture lady to go through hell for being involved with me so I refused to turn any arch friendship into a relationship, even in gradschool, though some might think otherwise. (Which is a shame as I valued a dear friend named \"C.O.\" more than she'll ever know but I didn't want her to be hurt by the bad apples.)  Instead, I pursued various engineers/artsy gals, or rather, they pursued me, if I want to be honest about who was chasing whom. But yeah, date outside your major to avoid drama and take advantage of events to meet new people. Put yourself out there in the open.",

We started dating in Feb of my junior year. In addition to a full class load, I was VP of my fraternity. Suddenly, something had to give and I, objectively, did a mediocre job as VP. Not the worst by any means but nowhere near what I had intended.\n\nI managed to not let my academics slip much but I did put off looking for summer jobs, etc. Thankfully, I had thrown my resume in a pile for Applied Physics Lab and they called me up at the very last minute.\n\nSenior year was about the same. It was not a deciding factor but proximity was a factor in choosing grad schools.\n\nOne interesting thing is that I used to fall asleep at almost every one of our watch-TV hangouts/dates. I was so tired that once I stopped moving, I was out.",

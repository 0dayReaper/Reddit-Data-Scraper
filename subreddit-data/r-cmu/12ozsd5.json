    "postText": "hi guys, i was recently admitted to cit unrestricted, and i\u2019m super super excited to come to cmu and study so many cool and interesting subjects!! however, browsing through the different subsections of cit, i\u2019m feeling a little overwhelmed by the sheer number of options available \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab and i wanted to know if any of u guys could help me decide what kind of trajectory i should take in my four years at cmu!!\n\nmy primary interest is using computational tools to solve novel problems in medicine. so anything from in silico drug discovery, to medical nanobots, to graphene-based drug delivery, to organ printing, to soft robotics! for this, i\u2019ll need bme and probably a minor in comp bio. however, since bme is always a double major, i need to choose another major from meche, ece, and mse. \n\ngiven my research interests and considering the relative difficulty (i don\u2019t want to die at cmu\u2026) and popularity (i also don\u2019t wanna be forever alone lolz) of each bme + (x | x \u2208 {meche, ece, mse}) dual major program, which majors/minors would you recommend i choose at cmu? any guidance would be so so appreciated!! thank uu \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79",

            "comment": "ChemE/BME here. bme isn't really a major itself. that's why it's not allowed as a single major here. bme is just a bio perspective of the principle engineerings (cive, cheme, matsci, ece, meche). what you \"study in bme\" is determined by your primary major. i study cheme, so i do research with drug delivery. \n\nfrom your list of interest, i would categorize them like this:\ncheme: silico, graphene, organs\nmatsci: silico, graphene, organs\ncive: (lol!)\nmeche: nanobot, robotics, organs\nece: nanobot\n\nif you're really interested in computation, you could try transferring into compbio in scs, but that's p difficult i think. ece would definitely give you the strongest computational background",

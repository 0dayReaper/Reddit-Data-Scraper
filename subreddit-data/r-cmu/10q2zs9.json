Are the tax filers at CMU good at what there doing or am I better off filing it myself through turbo tax or something like that for more accurate write-offs?",

            "comment": "Not quite an answer to the original question, but if you made less than $73,000 you should probably not pay for tax prep unless you have rather complicated investment related profit/loss. The IRS has several programs which offer free tax prep if you have less than 73k AGI.\n\nI think the most well known is [IRS Free File](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free), which basically gets you free access to turbo tax or similar. I have used FreeTaxUSA for this previously and would recommend it (for 3+ state returns as well) and have had no issues, although they do have a lower AGI threshold than some of the other options.\n\nAdditionally you may qualify for [VITA](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/free-tax-return-preparation-for-qualifying-taxpayers); depending on where you live, this would be through https://www.getyourrefund.org/en. The AGI threshold here is around 60k.",

TurboTax has a cd you can but that has multiple state filings included.  Or you can do the pa return by hand because it\u2019s easy.  What other state are you filing for? What kind of write-offs are you envisioning?  Is this w2 income or 1099 or self employed?",

I am sure this not specific to international students and would probably be for everyone.  Not a 100% sure though, you could email the student services (The Hub) for a confirmation.",

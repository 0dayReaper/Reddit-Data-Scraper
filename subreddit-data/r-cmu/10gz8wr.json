The degrees awarded are CMU degrees (not CMU-Qatar degrees).\n\nThe biggest hindrance I've seen for CMUQ graduates finding jobs globally are work-visa related, not degree related.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that CMUQ is small.  This is both good and bad.  Good because you'll have smaller class sizes and a better relationship with the faculty.  Bad because your course options are much more limited.",

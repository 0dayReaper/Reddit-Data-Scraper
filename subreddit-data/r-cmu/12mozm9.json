Else, the core courses that have exams will be shared and soon after the type of material that you will be tested on will also be shared. You take the exams on your home computer using a lockdown browser. Academic services should share with you when information becomes available but the exams are typically scheduled throughout the summer. If there is a core course (one that doesn\u2019t have an exam this summer) that you feel you took an equivalent course previously then you can petition the professor who teaches it with like a copy of your syllabus and transcript grade in the class to exempt it.",

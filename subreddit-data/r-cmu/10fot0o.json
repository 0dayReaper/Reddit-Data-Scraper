Intro to accounting student here, and I was wondering if anyone may have an e-copy of  Horngren's Accounting 13th edition Miller-Nobles, Mattison and Matsumura , or a physical copy they wouldn't mind me borrowing/taking pics of? These textbook costs sure get expensive... any help would be appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jmsyg0wrlwca1.png?width=703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d5b796e52df49e19cd01ce1a01143ca74578bb0d",

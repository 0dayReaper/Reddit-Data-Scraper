    "postText": "Has anyone ever taken Learning in Museums? I have a last minute waitlist decision to make and I'm not sure if joining that course will be worth dropping 2 other courses I've already started.\n\nGeneral question even if you haven't taken the course - is it worthwhile to drop one course after syllabus week to join a full week late in another course? For reference, I'm a second semester senior and none of the courses I'm choosing between are required.",

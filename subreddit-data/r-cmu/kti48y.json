            "comment": "Holy shit. In one of these emails, someone who I assume is Kiron Skinner says \"I don't condone what they did. **I believe had I been there I could have persuaded some of them to stop the violence.**\"\n\nFucking lmao. What a pompous response. Sure thing Kiron! Seems likely you could have talked a white supremacist braggart into taking his feet off of Nancy Pelosi's desk. Or maybe you could have talked flex cuff and pistol guy into, I dunno, rethinking his plot to run extrajudicial trials for any congressperson unlucky enough to cross his path? Why call the National Guard when we've got KIRON SKINNER and her lecture about STRUCTURAL REALITIES?! What were you going to do? Read them excerpts from your Regan letters book until everyone fucking fell asleep? \n\nIt's pretty clear from her responses here that Skinner is operating in bad faith. At least I hope that's the case, because honestly, if she actually believes what she's saying in these emails, she's too stupid to continue to be employed by CMU. \n\nAlso, heads up u/TribLive. I hope this gets some traction in the press, because this is wild and the university should be exceedingly embarrassed.",

It was about a national security medal he had gotten.\n\nFor context, Richard Grenell has been actively destabilizing the country by casting doubt on the election results (Nevada specifically) and coronavirus safety protocols. He is being funded not from CMU's budget but from a private pot of money that Kiron controls and raised from her political connections. CMU's administration has done nothing to contain him.\n\nAccording to Farnam, Richard Grenell has never once stepped foot on CMU's campus.\n\n\\*EDIT\\* see u/moraceae's comment.",

The current claim of SCS specificity is made by a M.E. on Facebook and the widespread assumption seems to be that Kiron is involved as well.\n\n2. The veracity of the emails can be challenged, though none are doing so and I trust my overlapping sources.\n\n3. The distance between sources and myself as a mouthpiece is intentional. I would encourage people to not confirm the identities of anyone in the chain, though I strongly encourage people to point out any omissions or inaccuracies as well.\n\nLet's focus more on what people are saying, and less on who is saying it.",

            "comment": "Hi, original poster here.\n\nI am a secondary source. I received the anonymized emails from numerous students who wanted to share them but were afraid of doing so. To quote my personal views on the ethical implications of sharing this anonymized multi-department-wide email chain:\n\n&gt; ... as it currently stands I view the thread as an expression of ideas and not an identification of individuals nor their viewpoints. Notably, it includes sorely missing dialogue from the people who wish to keep Grenell, and it includes the usual objections against that, so in some sense it balances the discussion.  \n&gt;\n&gt; The student body has been stonewalled for a very long time with regards to this issue, which strongly factored into my judgment on this matter.  \n&gt;\n&gt; The idea in posting these were to demonstrate to the student body that some faculty did care, quite deeply, and I suppose also on both sides.\n\nAdditionally, the anonymization is meant to focus the discussion around the ideas expressed instead of the individuals involved. Please debate ideas and not individuals.\n\nI would prefer to keep all discussion to the CMU community, where people have skin in the game and will stand behind what they say. The Overlooked @ CMU Facebook group requires authentication and I encourage all discussion to move there. Please note that this post is not deleted there -- it is unclear why /u/RicoHatchVS believes that to be the case.",

Grenell did action X, Y, Z indicating certain \"facts\" and most of these can be falsified by actual evidence. \n\nThere are basically 2 simple questions that needs to be answered in order to get to a decision:\n\n1. How does CMU characterize and define misinformation and thus does what Grenell did fall into that category?\n2. In the spirit of the fundamental principle of free speech, do we then allow misinformation to get through as a compromise? Because it's always gonna happen and hell, its happening all over the freaking Internet. (the US government itself struggles to answer this)\n\nI'm all about debating ideas but in this case, we do need focus. Without that, it is easy to bring in seemingly relevant issues and this discussion will go nowhere or default to the neutral state.\n\nMy 2c.",

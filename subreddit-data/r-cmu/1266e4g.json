    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture. After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.\n\nDesperation has always been a common aspect to life in architecture studio. Even overclocking computer science majors had a better time finding a date than your typical archie, who was always chained to his work in studio. Still, some archies had worse luck than others. This true tale occurred with one such unfortunate soul.\n\nBack then there used to be a scrawny bearded Indian fellow who ran his year\u2019s clique of A-grade students. While he earned the admiration of his professors for topnotch work, he received nothing but various levels of disgust by colleagues outside his rambunctious clique for different reasons. Some say it was because he was always bullying and harassing his favorite victims on an almost daily basis. Others say it was because his creepy sketches and doodles betrayed a sensually deviant side to him. A few would point out his irregular hygiene and the [one infamous time](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/uuweww/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_43_the_strongest/) he stunk up an entire studio in the early summer heatwave. Most would agree it was a combination of all of the above. Regardless, he earned by third year a less-than-positive reputation apart from his golden studio presentations. This may have turned a campus usually verdant with opportunities into an empty desert for his lonely heart.\n\nOne spring day, a solid white life-sized mannequin torso appeared in the CFA architecture studio. Its exact origins were unknown. It could have come from the famous Lunar Gala crew, or maybe from the design school in Maggie Mo. It was a pristine profile of the fit feminine form, blessed with features to adequately model women\u2019s fashions without the trouble of awkwardly fitting the attire on a live model for testing.\n\nWhatever its reasons for suddenly appearing in studio, the mannequin torso quickly moved from the general studio space to one desk in particular. I can\u2019t imagine the excuses he must have given the professors for its presence but day in and day out, that kid had it on his desk. A study on the human proportion and architecture? Ergonomics? Scale reference? Eventually, even the professors must have grown tired of seeing the naked form on his desk gathering telltale graphite smears in certain areas. A mere few weeks were all it took for the smudged up torso to betray the true nature of that student\u2019s activity with the mannequin. Hushed whispers flurried about it. \n\nWhatever love the student found that spring with his beloved mannequin did not survive past the semester; for indeed as soon as he left to return to his family for the summer break, another student paid to perform studio clean up and maintenance took one look of disgust at the creepily smeared mannequin and threw it in the dumpster. Apparently, he may have found more than just graphite stains on the dry old torso figure and spent the rest of the day washing his hands. Sometimes in studio, you really do need gloves.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d",

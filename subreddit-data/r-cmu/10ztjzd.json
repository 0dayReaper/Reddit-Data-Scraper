            "comment": "36700 - Probability and Mathematical Statistics is an amazing foundational course in prob/stats for ML folks. Highly prof dependent though, would 100% recommend if Siva Balakrishnan is taking it. Will keep you in good stead from the stats side of things in future ML work. You could also try 36-705 (if you are more daring :))\n\n11785 - Introduction to Deep Learning, really solid course that covers everything DL related. Taught from a very application POV, but wonderful in learning how to actually deploy DL models and pipelines.\n\n10605 - ML with Large Datasets, A more utilitarian course on handling large datasets and running models at scale. Not super eye opening or anything, but quite useful.\n\n10725 - Convex Optimization, An MLD course focusing entirely on optimization (both convex and non-convex), and going into optimizers and their properties. Goes quite deep, good to check course content before deciding if it is relevant for you.\n\n11611/11711 - NLP, decent course for language models, and the field of NLP in general. I thought it was pretty poorly taught, but good to learn it formally I guess.\n\n10-708 - Probabilistic Graphical Models, covers modern graphical methods in ML, quite a heavy course, but definitely useful (and will become more useful in the future)\n\n10716 - Advanced Machine Learning, a super theoretical dive into ML, very geared towards proof based methods and algorithmic guarantees of ML frameworks. Requires heavy math, real analysis, linal etc. ONLY take it if you have the necessary background.\n\n11777 - Multimodal, 10703 - Deep RL, Visual Learning and Recognition etc are quite domain specific, and are good if you are interested in learning more in that area.",

I would guess that in any given year, there should be 3-5 undergrads (out of 200-250) who would be able to take this and do well.\n\nThat's based off BSCS -- I'm not sure whether the BSAI changes (increases?) that number.",

I guess DeepMind's Stratego [0] is an example of relevant material. I'm an outsider to these fields, but game theory problems have always seemed much more relevant and applicable to my work (e.g., exploitability matters much more than accuracy, and games seem more real than yet another spin on MNIST).\n\n[0] https://www.deepmind.com/blog/mastering-stratego-the-classic-game-of-imperfect-information",

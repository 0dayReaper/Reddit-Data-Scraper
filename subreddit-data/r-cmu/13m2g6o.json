    "postText": "Hi all, I was recently admitted into Tepper as a transfer student. I just wrapped up my first of year college, and to be honest I really enjoy going to my current school, so I would only really transfer for academic reasons (currently at a top 40-50)\n\nFirst of all, is CMU good for accepting transfer credits? My letter says I was admitted as a first year even though I would now be a sophomore. I\u2019d be paying full price and I cannot afford to take an extra semester/year. \n\nSecond, what do you all do for fun? I was wondering how feasible it is to go out into the city and what the culture for parties is like. Also, do people go to the sports games here?\n\nThird, is the school really that hard? I\u2019m gonna have an easy business major. The school I am currently at is notorious for being hard and having grade deflation but I was able to get a 4.0 with club involvement and a social life. Im not even that good at time management either so I just want to hear some opinions on this.\n\nFourth, does CMU have good study abroad programs? If I stay at my current school I\u2019m gonna do a semester in London which I\u2019m really looking forward to. I just want to make sure I could do the same here. \n\nFifth, is there a good alumni network for business majors? I wanna do consulting or investment banking and I wanted to hear some opinions from students who are doing the same. \n\nThanks in advance everyone",

There's also a soccer team nearby. \nThere are a few neighborhoods besides Oakland with nightlife that are accessible by bus but quicker to ride-share. Laurenceville, Southside, Northside.\nYou will have no trouble maintaining an active social life in Tepper, from what I have seen.\nGreat museums (and free admission to most), great parks next to campus (disc golf, hiking, biking), tons of restaurants within walking distance and even more a short bus ride away, bars/clubs if your interested, frat/sorority parties if you're interested, amazing bike trails all over the city, really great theater (both on campus with the T5 drama school, but also multiple theaters downtown (short bus ride)), 4 pro sports teams, lots of festivals, fun art crawls. There's no beach or mountains but otherwise I think you can find whatever you like to do.",

I came here with an Associates in Arch and the advisor in arch accepted all transfer credit except studio \"because we do studio differently here.\" \n\nSo I started first year studio here with a bunch of freshmen. I told her if I had to start studio at the beginning, then the profs were to not be told of my prior experience lest I be judged differently. She thought that was fair enough. All the other credits being transferred let me pursue a bunch of other courses while my colleagues kept wondering why I wasn't in the other required courses. \n\nWatch out for housing, as you may start as a first year but housing may boot you for being technically a second year, sometimes within a couple weeks of school starting. That happens sometimes. \n\nSchoolwork is demanding for Tepper, Arch, and other departments but someone figured Arch was most demanding of hours required. So you should have some free time for fun in Tepper as Archies do but won't admit. \n\nStudy abroad is possible but on your dime. You have to figure out the logistics.",

Some you pay the same as you would going to CMU (including any financial aid) and others you pay whatever the other school charges (usually less than full price at CMU). However, if u/roy4lewithcheese is looking to get out of here in three years, that may limit their ability to study abroad during the semester, depending on how the transfer credits look. CMU Qatar would likely be an option since they have the same Business Administration major",

I also had a matlab based CS class count for the Python based class required at CMU. Every humanities class I took, such as  psychology, got transfer credit that I was able to use as general electives. CMU requires you take 2 intro engineering classes - I had one transfer which I heard is rare - but I ended up taking an additional 2 anyways, along with a required writing class that freshman have to take. So I got all caught up with the freshman requirements, completed the major and a minor, all in 3 years at CMU without ever overloading my courses (did have a few AP credits that helped as well). I will say, have your daughter start compiling the syllabi to all of the classes she has taken, they ask for those and I was scrambling to find them!",

            "comment": "Hi! Rising Tepper senior that has dealt with transfer credits. I have also studied abroad in London before. \n\n1. The transfer credit process is very convoluted. There are restrictions to the amount of transfer credits you can receive. I believe it\u2019s 5 classes total but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same for transfer students (I believe it\u2019s slightly different). But in terms of the classes you can transfer, Tepper (and other colleges/departments) will only transfer a class if there is a class almost identical to the transfer class at cmu. Sometimes it can be counted as an elective but you only need so many of those. I transferred 2 college credit classes from high school that counted as direct replacements. Also, in Tepper it is very easy to graduate early. I have many friends that are graduating in 3.5 or even 3 years. All of them have double majors too. So even though you\u2019re being admitted as a first year, you can definitely graduate in 3. \n\n2. In half the students there\u2019s a work hard, play hard mentality. There\u2019s definitely opportunities to go out and have fun with friends. There\u2019s about 2-3 clubs that students like to go to and quite a few bars that are close enough to campus. There are parties too but it\u2019s definitely not as much as other party schools. It\u2019s also relatively easy to go to the city since we have free access to the bus system. I usually try to go out and do something every other weekend. But I also have a car, which makes it much easier to go out. For fun, people usually get food together, join clubs they\u2019re interested in, and hang with friends tho. The other half have a pretty set grind mentality and they mainly focus on career and academics. Sports games isn\u2019t that common. I have never once gone to a football game and I don\u2019t even know when they happen. Sports is not a big thing here at all but it is available if you\u2019re interested. \n\n3. This school is HARD. I cannot stress how hard this college is. Although i have no concept of how rigorous BU is, cmu is very rigorous. There is a reason cmu is one of the most depressed schools. But it also depends on what your high school was like. I come from a public high school in the Midwest, so my classes were very easy and I didn\u2019t have to try much in school. The classes at cmu are definitely rigorous. Less so in Tepper but we do also have to take non Tepper classes. If your high school was very competitive, then cmu would be pretty similar. I would say though that the hardest part would be the culture and less of the classes themselves. Many people choose to overload on classes and are involved in other extra curricular a such as TAing or doing research. There is also a big internship culture at cmu where everyone focuses on getting internships for the summer even as freshman. I realized that I don\u2019t like pushing myself as hard as others and have found people that also like to explore the city and take breaks every so often. I have also joined a lot of non academic clubs that really help with the academic stress. Time management is pretty important here though. I have even considered transferring out of cmu a couple times, but I am at a place now where I have found a good balance and am enjoying cmu again. \n\n4. Cmu does have a few good study abroad programs but everyone (even the study abroad advisors) recommends you go through a separate program or apply directly to the college. If you go through cmu, you have to pay cmu tuition, and most of the time the cost of the program is much cheaper than tuition. Unless you have really good financial aid. I studied abroad in the summer and did two 3 week programs at two different unis in London. Each program was about \u00a31500-2000 and I got to transfer two classes. If I went through cmu, I would have had to pay their summer tuition which is ~$450 a unit and typical classes are 9 units. \n\n5. I think there\u2019s a pretty good alumni network here? I\u2019m not the most well connected with alumni but they are very willing to help even if they don\u2019t know you at all. There are a lot of people in the ib and consulting industries from cmu (i\u2019m doing consulting this summer) and quite a few companies recruit from here. Numerous alumni reached out to me after i got an offer for my internship asking if I wanted to set up a chat and they can answer any questions I have since they have experience working there. I knew none of them previously. I think alumni are usually so willing because they understand what we have gone through and want to help since others have likely helped them. Cmu is definitely a very collaborative school rather than competitive from my experience. \n\nI can definitely answer any more questions if you have them !\n\nEdited to add more info.",

I think it\u2019s because Tepper has a pretty decent double counting policy and a lot of majors that people double in work well with the business major. Quite a few people I know also come in with a lot of ap credit. Although I had none so it\u2019s not necessary. \n\nI think mainly it\u2019s because not many Tepper classes have prerequisites so it\u2019s common to take them in whatever order we want. For other majors, it\u2019s pretty sequential and certain classes are only offered one semester (spring only for example)\n\nTepper also requires a minor + concentration for every student. But double majoring exempts you from that. It\u2019s only a couple classes more so it\u2019s pretty common to do that too.",

It\u2019s just a much smaller portion than other schools. So like some folks have said, the frats throw parties, the sports teams throw parties, and some of the other student Orgs throw parties. The reality is that the party scene is small enough that you\u2019re going to be partying with pretty much the same people most of the time, which can get old.  Also like other people said there are bars nearby, and if you\u2019re outgoing like I wasn\u2019t, you can find your way to parties at Pitt or other nearby schools.",

It was fine, nothing insane but the sports and Buggy orgs all throw some decent parties.  Mostly people who live off campus will host smaller events with friends though.  Find some good friends, or be a host yourself.",

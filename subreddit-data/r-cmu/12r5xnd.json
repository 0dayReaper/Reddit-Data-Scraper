Morewood is slightly more complicated since the first entry door is the same for both gardens and e-tower but there is additional spots where you must tap your id card to gain access making it so that only e-tower can access e-tower and gardens access gardens. This doesn\u2019t mean that you will be unable to enter the other buildings but you will need to be invited by someone who lives there and they must open any doors that are controlled there.",

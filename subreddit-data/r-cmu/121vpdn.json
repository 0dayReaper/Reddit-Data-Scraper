    "postText": "Hi everyone,   \nI have received an admit from CMU for MS ECE for Fall 2023. I had some questions regarding TA/RA opportunities:\n\n* How difficult is it for MS ECE students to get TAships/RAships in the same/different department?\n* Is there any tuition fee waiver for TA/RAships?\n* I read that co-op interns are not allowed at all for international students and that any internships must be done only during the summer. Can someone please confirm this?\n\nAny help will be appreciated.  \nThanks in advance!",

    "postText": "I'm trying to get a parking permit on campus but the waitlist is too long and I don't think I'll get off until next fall.  Does anyone know alternative places to park off campus (long term) but close by?\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I don't mind spending a bit of money to park.  I'm just looking for a permanent place to park my car for the semester that is preferrably nearby campus.",

This part of town doesn\u2019t require street parking resident permits and has no parking meters. \n\nThere\u2019s also 3 hour meter parking on Schenley Drive south of campus that\u2019s good if you only need parking for 1-2 classes. \n\nAlso FYI, if you plan on leaving campus after 5pm, you can enter the east campus garage at anytime and then swipe your CMU card when leaving to get free parking.",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI am looking for apartments for the next year and wanted to know about the experience of CMU students with housing management like John C.R. Kelly Realty, Forbes Management, Meyers Management, etc. I went through some of the posts on the Pittsburgh Reddit community and I observed that the student crowd sometimes gets a different treatment from landlords and management. If you all know about the other housing management and can share your experience with them, that would also be helpful.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I've been living under Colebrook Management and they're not totally awful. Management has sent people for repairs and generally left us alone, but their properties are probably some to try and avoid. The buildings have roaches and they basically blamed us for that, and there has been constant early morning construction as of late. Also, when lease renewal came around they increased the rent by 400 dollars. I would say if you can make the most of it or don't have any other options it's not the worst, but I am moving somewhere else next year for sure. Good luck.",

    "postText": "Hi,\nI was recently admitted to MS in Mechanical \u2013 Advanced Study Program but before making a final decision, I had a few doubts about the program:\n1)\tI am interested in pursuing the degree with a concentration in Energy and Thermal Systems. But scouring linkedin and reddit I could not find any such profiles. Most of the students are pursuing Robotics, Control Systems or diving towards ML courses. So, is there a particular reason for this and are the faculty and research opportunities for energy and thermals, limited/subpar ?\n\n2)\tTo apply for RA and CA positions can I start applying right away ? I could not find any bulletins where they have put up for any vacancies and any open spots for the same. It would be great if anybody could share it. \n\n3)\tIt is a 3 semester program. Most traditional masters program are 4 semesters, so will it impact in any way while applying for jobs post MS.  And how is the job scenario in energy and thermal systems department, haven\u2019t heard anything great until now.\n\n4)\tCan I switch from an advanced study program to a research program. What are the requirements for that ?\n\nThankyou in advance !!!!!",

            "comment": "For 1: There being many robotics, controls, and ML courses, which are broadly popular hence you seeing them more on LinkedIn. There are groups focused on energy, thermal systems, and thermo fluids but it does not have as big of a research presence, in comparison, at CMU. Check below to see some class offerings https://meche.engineering.cmu.edu/education/graduate-programs/ms-advanced-study-concentrations.html. There is a graduate handbook that can give you details regarding switching https://meche.engineering.cmu.edu/education/graduate-programs/handbooks.html. I'd recommend browsing the cmu faculty list in MechE, cheme, and CEE to see which groups interest you the most. Not sure if RAships are available for masters, maybe a professor might rarely be able to offer one. Try emailing some profs to see their recruitment plans for MS students for 2023",

I plan to get an internship during the year and work while I attend college. \n\nRice is beautiful but TX is a little out of my comfort zone. \n\nCMU seems to only focus on engineering and CS which I have no interest or particular talent. I didn't get into any other schools :(\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "First of all, don\u2019t feel bad about \u201conly\u201d getting into three great schools. Admissions gets harder every year and you did great.\n\nOf those 3, I\u2019d personally say it\u2019s a toss up between CMU and Cornell. The Ivy imprimatur is worth something, and Cornell\u2019s academics are great, but like you said \u2014 quality of life also matters.\n\nI can say that the math undergrads (and PhDs) I\u2019ve met at CMU are passionate and skilled, and I think Pittsburgh is a good place to live. I\u2019ve worked with some policy grad students at CMU and think Heinz is also an excellent school.\n\nAs for internships\u2026 term-time internships are tough. Would not recommend. I did one for one semester and it was hard. Work-study and on-campus jobs are more chill and doable, but you can get those from any school.",

It sounds like you may have a bright future as an analyst at some think tank. Look inward to find out what your most interested in. It\u2019s ok to be uncertain and to change your mind a lot. \n\nHave you considered looking at the faculty for both departments at the two school? Perhaps there\u2019s a few professors whose work you are interested in and you\u2019d like to work with on undergrad or graduate research. \nExample: you\u2019re interested in studying methods of determine the impact of X social program. At Y university there\u2019s a professor who\u2019s a current leader in the that exact field and they love working with students. \n\nUltimately, Networking is very important, I got my job because I assisted with my professor with their project. You also learn a ton by talking to people in the fields your interested in. It\u2019s really more about WHO you know and WHAT you can do than what ever scores you get in classes.\n\nLocation is also important. Personally I think Ithaca is a great laid back place to focus on studies. Pittsburgh has that city feel. I didn\u2019t get out much when I was working on my Masters at CMU. \n\nI wish you the best!",

It\u2019s true CMU has heavily leaned on the fact that they are a #1 CS program and have a top 5 college of engineering as well. However, we are incredibly interdisciplinary. Heinz is highly rated and we have renown statisticians. \n\nI don\u2019t know much about Cornell. The only thing I do know about Rice is that their applied math department recently made it too hard for a GEM Fellow to continue, even though they had a full ride. I actually facilitated their meeting one of the Deans in our Math dept for their potential choice for PhD. Beware if you\u2019re looking for inclusivity.",

            "comment": "CMU math major here! I feel like I can tell you about my perspective on the math department. \n\nI came to CMU intending to major in something else within MCS. I decided to choose math at the end of my freshman year because of how great the math courses were. All of the instructors are passionate about what they teach, and my peers are helpful and supportive. I\u2019m currently doing mathematical research under a very supportive, understanding professor, and there aren\u2019t many places that offer undergraduate math research opportunities. And I can confidently say that I made the best possible choice that I could have made. \n\nIn terms of on-campus jobs, you can always become an undergraduate TA, which was one of my favorite jobs I\u2019ve ever had. It depends on who you ask, but math TAs get paid pretty well imo, and you might get a raise depending on your level of experience. \n\nAlso, before you say CMU only focuses on CS, try doing a research on the math department here! We\u2019re world class for combinatorics and mathematical logic. I.e. try searching up Ramsey Theory/Number in google and go to a wikipedia page. You\u2019ll see two of our amazing professors in the references section. (If you\u2019re lucky enough and the timings are just right, you\u2019ll probably be able to learn ramsey theory from them too!)",

You reach out to professors who do math logic and ask if there are research opportunities. Ofc read some papers/texts on math logic. Do keep in mind that math logic is a big area, so be sure to see which area of logic you are interested in!",

CMU doesn\u2019t have name rec either and it\u2019s also a very grindy environment, but it does have a very nice location. Cornell has great name rec but an awful location and a worse culture than CMU. Obviously all three have great programs (don\u2019t sleep on CMU, its math programs are often ranked within T10 and they score incredibly high on the Putnam). IMO if you\u2019re alright with the grind culture at CMU, come here; otherwise go to Rice, you might like the location more than you think!",

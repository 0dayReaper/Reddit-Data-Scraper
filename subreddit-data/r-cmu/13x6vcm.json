    "postText": "Obviously this is just my opinion, but I largely dislike the Antin brothers as my landlords. They\u2019re unresponsive to my requests, wrongly charge me for things out of my control, and are overall hugely rude to me and my family. I realize it\u2019s somewhat hard to avoid leasing from them especially if you want to live near campus, but I am so disturbed by their behavior towards me as a tenant that I just have to put it out there.",

They seem to predate on underclassmen students who don\u2019t know much about renting in Pittsburgh yet. \n\nI went out of my way to avoid their other properties even if it meant living farther from campus; my landlord this year wasn\u2019t amazing but was a dream compared to the Antin\u2019s.",

What was your reason for taking those course and do you know if it\u2019s significantly harder than other capstone courses?\n\nCould you also share pros and cons of the class? Most people ik take 18500 so I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t really have a team to work with either",

People in the class include ECE, MechE, CFA, HCI, and others (both undergrads and grad students).\n\nI took it because it was later in the day compared to 18500 (18540 was at 3pm compared to 18500 at 10am). I think 18540 actually was significantly easier than 18500.",

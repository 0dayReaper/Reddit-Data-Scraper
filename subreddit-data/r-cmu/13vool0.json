    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all!\nI\u2019m an international incoming grad student and my friends and I are looking for housing externally. I had a couple of questions and would be grateful if anyone could clear these up for me -\n\n1) What areas are best in terms of affordability of housing and proximity to the university?\n\n2) What rent bracket (per person) should we be looking at?\n\n3) How much do utilities cost and which utilities typically should already be covered in the rent?\n\n4) Apart from zillow and apartment.com, any other good sources to find housing? \n\nThank you sm!",

            "comment": "Welcome to CMU!  \n1. Most grad students I know live in Shadyside or Squirrel Hill, the later I believe from anecdotes to be cheaper on average. Some folks live in Oakland as it is very close to campus but most undergrads also live near there and UPitt undergrad seem to be a little more lively in that area. I would try to see how you can easily access bus routes from a potential home.\n\n2.this varies greatly on a number of factors, and rent is increases year to year. Check out this link to see details gathered from the GSA on a surveyed pool of students and their living conditions: https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/Resources-for-Graduate-Students/gsa-housing-guide-updated-3.7.19.pdf\n\n3. I am not sure exactly how to answer this. Personally my utilities are separate from rent. (Live in squirrel hill). This includes gas, water, electricity, and internet.\n\n4. I would try Facebook groups (they often are titled CMU/PITT off campus housing and roommates). BUT PLEASE BEWARE OF SCAMS, never pay anything unless you have seen video footage of a place and can verify who you are talking is a landlord or actual roommate.",

Know that the GSA is working on updating housing info - it unfortunately probably won't be helpful for this upcoming academic year but it'll definitely be in place by spring of next year for the '24-25 year!",

            "comment": "I would look at shadyside or Oakland for closeness! I was able to walk to campus from shadyside and took about 20 minutes or an 8/10 minute bus ride! I pay about $650 a month (I live with two other people), and my current utilities for the house run around $150 for electricity and $100 for gas that changes depending on weather but it\u2019s also split between three people. For groceries I would stay away from giant eagle and go to Aldi! Extra advice about Pittsburgh and cmu- m as an incoming international grad student - invest in good winter clothes! Thermals are a must, and good winter boots! It really helps when you\u2019re waiting for buses or walking! Good luck!",

    "postText": "Hello Guys\n\nHow is the \"Online\" offering of Masters in Software Engineering at CMU compared to \"Online\" Masters in Computer Science at Georgia tech?\n\nI understand CMU is probably one of top 3 in the US but my question is for their 'online' offering.\n\nAlso, CMU says software engineering compared to GaTech's Computer Science.\n\nDo you have some information on how these two compare and what is better over what, in what way? \n\nCost could be one factor. GaTech's OMSCS costs about $8K total. How much does CMU's online MSE cost? \n\nAnd I'm interested about other comparisions too as my company will reimburse upto a certain limit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankyou in advance.",

            "comment": "MSE student here.  It\u2019s not CS.  Software Engineering is all about people, processes, and techniques for constructing software.  Classes include software management theory, communications for leaders, and requirements.  It\u2019s very different from computer science that focuses on algorithms and data structures.  Although the MSE program has electives and people do take CS courses like deep learning and machine learning, it\u2019s not the focus.  The MSE program costs roughly $57k.  You really need to know what you want to get out of a program before you commit.",

            "comment": "Why do you want the degree? SE and CS can be very different curriculums, especially at graduate level. If you just want the credentials go cheaper. If you want a particular set of topics pay close attention to the course descriptions.\n\nBe mindful that many graduate programs simply look at Master\u2019s degrees as money makers to support doctoral students.",

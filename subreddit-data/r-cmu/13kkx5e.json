    "postText": "Hello, I am an incoming grad student at CMU and I trying to finalize my apartment for this upcoming year. The 2 options I was between were Tiffany Place and an apartment owned by Forward Management, I was wondering if any current students had any information about the management for these two buildings, specifically if there were any issues to be aware of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions for 1 bed 1 bath apartments under $1000 that would also be greatly appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

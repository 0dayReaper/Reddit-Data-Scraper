    "postText": "Most of the TAs I have had the pleasure of meeting so far have been so helpful. Intelligence and humility is a combo we don't see enough, and the world would be a much better place if we had more people like them who are not only smart but also down-to-earth. Thanks for being so immensely helpful!\n\n\\+ you guys seriously need a raise lol (ik it's an honorable job but still)\n\n\\+ oh wow, thanks for giving me my first award, u/farnamjahanian! This is the validation I didn't know I needed. Also this officially confirms now that a) we CMU folks all be out here on reddit and b) the school at least knows we want pay raise for TAs.",

    "postText": "\nHi so I was recently accepted into these programs and I\u2019m totally lost on what to choose. I\u2019m leaning Cornell because it seems beautiful and interdisciplinary but also the most once in a lifetime experience of the three, but I admire how cool CMU\u2019s cs program is a lot and I can\u2019t believe I was accepted, and Berkeley isn\u2019t a sleeper either and is very close to home but I don\u2019t like the idea of going to school with so many people. I\u2019m mainly considering CMU and Cornell at this point but I haven\u2019t completely crossed out Berkeley yet. I haven\u2019t gotten a financial offer from CMU yet but Cornell is looking like it will only be 2k a year and Berkeley 10k. I do have a soft spot for Cornell and how much they\u2019ve been reaching out to me for support and all that (I even got a likely letter) but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that the whole world is available to me if I go to cmu, please help.\n\nAlso are y\u2019all okay lol I\u2019ve heard that many students at CMU (not even just cs majors) are malnourished and depressed, is this true or is it just complainey stuff, thanks.",

Consider CMU is slightly better academically, and that its student body is smaller, kinder, and more collaborative, but the social life is relatively dry and everyone is depressed. On the other hand, Berk EECS is ever so slightly worse than SCS, and its student body is enormous and cutthroat (Berkeley loves to torture its undergrads), but the social life blows CMU\u2019s out of the water and people are generally happier there.",

I am from berkeley and currently attending cmu and having the ability to drive to the beach or to a lake or go for a hike is much more convenient in berkeley than in pittsburgh. Otherwise I completely agree with this tier listing. I would have chosen berkeley if I had been accepted to one of there engineering programs could I go back and do it all over.\n\nAnother note, the culture on the east coast is a lot less accepting in general in terms of weed but also like getting into parties and events. Everything sells out instantly and is stressful to get. And parties (at least frat parties) always have a list and multiple bouncers. Berkeley has a much more accepting layed back culture.",

I\u2019ve heard all the stories of depression from there, especially from the engineering school. They had to put a net under what the students called the \u201csuicide bridge\u201d so do what you will with that. The surrounding area is basically only a college town, so you can\u2019t really go out anywhere else besides school. They also sent me a likely letter, but I couldn\u2019t shake all the stories of being depressed from my friends and classmates who went there. Keep in mind I am very biased due to the people I know so take what I say with a grain of salt.\n\nIn terms of CS CMU and Cornell aren\u2019t even close. The huge amount of opportunities with jobs and internships are almost just handed to you, especially as you go closer towards graduation. The breadth in CS and the support is amazing too. There is only one CS major in Cornell Engineering, while at CMU SCS, you can choose between CS, AI, comp bio, and human-computer interaction. Besides the primary majors, there\u2019s additional majors/concentrations in Robotics, systems, language technologies (like NLP), computer graphics, ML, security, and software engineering. In Ideate there are minors in game design &amp; animation and much more. You\u2019ll learn all about these majors in the freshman immigration course if you choose to go here.\n\nBesides having so much to explore in SCS itself, CMU is also interdisciplinary, and you\u2019re able to take essentially any class you want. I took a Body Politics class once and talked about the clitoris all day. It was awesome.\n\nAddressing the depression at CMU, it\u2019s not going to be much worse at what is happening at Cornell. I don\u2019t really experience this, but I think for those that are depressed, they\u2019re mainly depressed at work in the classes, not competition. You bond with the people you\u2019re taking these classes with, and you help each other succeed.\n\nI ultimately chose CMU due to these reasons and I don\u2019t regret my choice one bit. I almost went to Cornell too because I hadn\u2019t heard of CMU before applying to college but now that I\u2019ve spent 4 years here, I can safely say you would be throwing away a huge professional/educational opportunity if you chose Cornell. Congrats though on getting in all 3 schools, that\u2019s a huge accomplishment!! :)",

Since you have no idea if they go to the school in question, and they generally represent a skewed subset of students if they do. \nYou will find your people no matter where you go. The vast majority of undergrads in SCS lead balanced, enjoyable lives, and love what they're doing, as I'm sure they do at your other choices. I think SCS has the best curriculum and professors in the world but I and also sure you will get a great education whichever you choose. \nThere are huge differences in the campuses and locations between your choices, especially Cornell, if that's important to you. I have no idea if the mental health issues at Cornell are myth or not, but it is seriously rural. I love Pittsburgh's location, cultural offerings, food, entertainment, parks, transportation system, sports, and the convenience of living in a major city. You may not.\nI hope you don't base your decision on Reddit, but I think you be happy wherever you choose. Good luck.",

It absolutely will count for the SE concentration (source: I am the concentration advisor) \n4) it has only be taught a few times, so it hasn\u2019t built up a buzz yet. \n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any more questions.",

After reviewing some of what he's written about API design elsewhere, I would encourage you to take the course. I think a lot of software would be a lot better if more people took it. (It sounds like he used to present the same material as part of a software engineering course that covered more topics. Perhaps he only recently decided that this topic merited a course by itself.)",

I know the course used to be a lot more Java-heavy when Josh taught it but when I took it, Charlie redesigned the curriculum to focus more on general API design principles, rather than Java. I'm not too sure how this Fall will look like since it seems like Josh is teaching it alone, but I can talk more about my experience taking the class with Charlie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n17-480 was definitely one of my favorite classes at CMU. The assignments were all in pairs or groups and each week, we focused on different aspects of API design, like naming, documentation, etc. with gradually increasing levels of design complexity. I found the class content really interesting and discussions were pretty engaging. We'd usually have class activities where people designed APIs to tackle some sort of problem and you'd discuss in small groups about different design choices you made and why one choice might be better than others. I used to think API design was simple and straightforward but taking the class made me realize that there was actually so much more to it if you wanted to build a good API.\n\nI also found the skills I learned in the class to be super helpful in industry when I interned last summer. Ymmv since I'm also generally quite interested in this field, but if you're interested too, I highly recommend this class!",

Your insights and feedback have been incredibly helpful in helping me decide to take this course.

            "comment": "I would either check with an advisor or with Joshua Bloch himself regarding 3 or 4, maybe it\u2019s a new course?\n\nMy personal opinion on these types of courses: like you said, APIs are widely used in industry. But that also means you will have the opportunity to learn it in the industry, and as a new grad, no one really has any expectation for you to know much about it. It might be helpful in terms of impressing people with your experience and getting promoted into a higher position faster, where you have more influence on the design aspect of projects, and once you\u2019re there, your experience in the course may help you design (and implement?) better. If this sounds good to you and you know you\u2019re going into the industry, then there\u2019s no better person to take this course from than Joshua Bloch.\n\nHowever, I would also consider the opportunity cost of this course. Because you take the time to take this, you miss out on being able to take another course at CMU. In my mind, there\u2019s three types of courses that are worth taking. 1) Courses that open up new paths for you. This could be courses in areas such as ML, networking, theoretical CS, etc. 2) Challenging courses that impress. The biggest one for me in this category would be OS. This course can significantly challenge your design and implementation skills. If displayed on your resume, people will probably recognize this course and be impressed. This is significant because it can open doors for you. 3) Courses that you are personally interested in. It might not exactly open pathways, but if you personally value this course then go for it.\n\nIf anything falls outside these categories, I would consider not taking it if you are able to. This is just advice from someone who wishes they selected courses better during their time at CMU :)",

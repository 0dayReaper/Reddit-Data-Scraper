At these you simply ask the desk attendant for the practice room key but you'll have to leave your ID with them until you return the key.\n\nThe Res on 5th has an okay piano (baby grand) that's just sitting in a front parlor, no key required. Everyone passing by can hear you, so if this makes you uncomfortable, this may not be the place for you.\n\nDM me if you want tips to get into other technically-not-public piano rooms.\n\nSource: non-major piano-playing alum who has played a lot of the school's pianos",

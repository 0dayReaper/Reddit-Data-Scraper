I keep debating if I should get pursue an ML concentration or not, keeping both the possibility of grad school (getting a master's in ML) and going into industry (doing ML related work) in mind. Would having an ML concentration help in either of these aspects? \n\nIf you have any insight please share! Thanks!!",

The only time you can be disappointed is if you could have tried harder and didn't.\n\n\nGrades seem like everything now because that's basically the only measuring stick nerdy kids have been using to measure themselves their whole lives so far. I know people with great GPAs I wouldn't trust to run a bath, and people who had meh GPAs who actually know how to think outside of a classroom test.",

And I can guarantee you, being on both sides of the school spectrum (Pitt Undergrad, CMU Masters), you'd probably ace all of Pitt's exams. Most companies will understand that. Hope that helps.",

I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be well prepared by Tuesday, the final probably won\u2019t be as intimidating as you practice more with the material. Reminder that a grade is just some letter associated with a class that probably wont mean too much in the long run :) u got this!",

Life goes on and I currently continue my study in a top 20 CS program (not the best but I shouldn't have anything to complain). I am doing what I enjoy and working for a robotics lab.  \n\nI lost my confidence during my undergrad. It was full of self-suspect, even a scotty could be a better programmer than me. But I am realizing it is not the fact when I back to school.\n\nTry to accept yourself, make peace in yourself and stop wasting your time thinking about it. It won't change anything. Do your job. You don't need to be superb, but you should at least have something that makes you proud.\n\nI know it's hard. I really do. My advisor told me to transfer to information system while another prof saved my whole life. He is the coolest man in my life. Good things will come. You just need to look ahead and go. Fuck the rest.",

What you remember, what you learn, and how you can apply it to various things in the real world, that's more valuable than your grades or how you compare to others, it will be what you remember down the line anyways.",

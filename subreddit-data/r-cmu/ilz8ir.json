There's no reason for you guys to be \"explaining\" things ahead or come up with something that is seemingly clever or otherwise spamming the chat and distract the class with all the notifs. We absolutely do not care about the 10+ AP courses you've taken in high school so please stop telling everyone. Please seek for validation from your parents instead of people who are actually trying to make the most out of the course.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the class isn't the most engaging... I would have dropped this class already if not for the fact that it's a requirement.\n\nThankfully none of my other classes are quite as freshmen-dominating or excruciating.. Hopefully the rigor of CMU subdues them a notch by soph year.  At least that seemed to be the trend in high school.",

You're absolutely right about about \"the rigor of CMU subduing them\" however, it'll likely be much sooner than sophomore year. (think: 2-3 weeks once the course material veers from basic E&amp;M to more ECE-stuff) \n\nRegarding lecture, you're certainly not alone. It's hard to stay engaged when you're in a (Zoom) room with 150 other students. I recommend taking advantage of office hours, small groups and recitations to get more personalized interaction with the course staff. (this is true for many, many other courses in ECE and at CMU)",

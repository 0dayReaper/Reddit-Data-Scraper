    "postText": "Hi, I'm an incoming Master's student @ LTI (3 semesters) and I have some prior experience with DL and training models (though not in depth). So would it be a good idea to take both 10601 IML and 11785 IDL in the 1st semester?   \n\n\nI know 11785 is intensive however I want to get good in DL ASAP and postponing it to 2nd semester doesn't really make sense to me as even then I'll have 2 more courses out of which one is similar in time commitment to 10601. Thoughts? And is this a supremely bad idea?",

I just got my ID today and I was able to get out of the garage when I left at 6. My other coworker who is also commuting and not a CMU student mentioned that they might bill it to a payment account. Has this happened to anybody? I'm trying to figure out if it will be better to just get a parking pass to avoid an unwanted surprise bill",

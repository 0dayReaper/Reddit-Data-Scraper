I\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely worth some thought.",

They sent me an email promising a refund that I never got. Would not buy again.",

Southwest used to do direct flights between Philly and Pittsburgh for dirt cheap, but that was like 15 years ago lol. Yes, the train is long, but it\u2019s actually a fairly comfortable experience - much better than the bus. I\u2019ve done it all and highly prefer the train.",

            "comment": "If you enjoy c0vm and took 112 / know a bit of Python, I strongly encourage you to play around with `dis` [0]! You can see the \"c0vm\" instructions for all Python functions pretty easily. :) For example,\n\n    &gt; import dis  \n    &gt; def fib(n):  \n          if n &lt;= 1:\n              return n\n          return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n    \n    &gt; dis.dis(fib)\n      2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (n)\n                  2 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)\n                  4 COMPARE_OP               1 (&lt;=)\n                  6 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE        6 (to 12)\n    \n      3           8 LOAD_FAST                0 (n)\n                 10 RETURN_VALUE\n    \n      4     &gt;&gt;   12 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (fib)\n                 14 LOAD_FAST                0 (n)\n                 16 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)\n                 18 BINARY_SUBTRACT\n                 20 CALL_FUNCTION            1\n                 22 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (fib)\n                 24 LOAD_FAST                0 (n)\n                 26 LOAD_CONST               2 (2)\n                 28 BINARY_SUBTRACT\n                 30 CALL_FUNCTION            1\n                 32 BINARY_ADD\n                 34 RETURN_VALUE\n\n\nIt's pretty cool imo to actually understand how this actually works (and to have written something similar). You can go further; understanding c0vm gives you all the techniques you need to get started with writing and/or understanding emulators for old systems (e.g., chip-8 is probably the easiest and you could do that in a month, you can try SNES or look up GBATEK (gameboy / nintendo DS) as a challenging summer project).\n\n[0] https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html",

I\u2019d suggest staying with the original NES. It has a number of hardware bugs that some games rely on, but nowhere near the complexity of the SNES.",

The class is about programming language theory and you'll learn all about implementing different languages with features and type systems of increasing complexity. You'll need at least 15-150 first though I believe. I came into CMU without knowing CS and programming languages ended up being my absolute favorite subject.",

If you enjoy writing your own programming language, \"Crafting Interpreters\" [0] has been highly regarded in tech circles (disclaimer: I have not read it myself and I don't have a good grasp of its difficulty level). It has the benefit of being free (!) and is explicitly catered towards someone who wants to build their own programming language, with fancy features like closures (being able to define functions inside functions) and garbage collection (not having to call `free()` manually). As an additional bonus, you'll probably develop more Java and C experience than most students at CMU.\n\n[0] https://craftinginterpreters.com/",

    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture. After  all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor  of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can  be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.\n\nOne sophomore spring semester, a group of archies were drafting their plans and sections. Out of boredom, the various tools at their disposals were eventually reimagined as weapons. T-squares became swords. Tubes were bazookas. An occasional scrap of basswood became a missile. You get the point. However, one of them grabbed a triangle and placed two corners between the palms of his hands, leaving the squared corner to pivot around freely. He spun it around quickly like a radar dish to the amusement of his colleagues.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d one of them asked.\n\n\u201cAn idiot detector.\u201d the kid answered with a smirk.\n\nSeconds later, the triangle stopped, pointing at one of the crowd, causing the rest to laugh. The kid walked around a few aisles, letting the triangle stop its rotation to point at random curious colleagues caught by the joke. This caused quite the guffaw and encouraged others to later pick up the simple trick.\n\nIronically, when a few tried to do the same trick with their own triangles, they found those triangles pointing back at themselves. This only caused more laughter at the unintentional self-deprecating humor.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d",

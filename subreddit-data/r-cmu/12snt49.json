I have decided I really want to major in MechE with Physics minor. Should I email the Engineering Dept and ask or does it look bad since I haven\u2019t committed yet. Thank you for any insights!",

Or are you saying that I should wait until Fall semester starts and talk to her then instead of reaching out to engineering now (before I start at CMU?)",

I should have said that no, there is no current plan to hire an overnight staff person. Hours were rolled back during COVID and have been (glacially) slowly been being extended here and there. Currently looks like the next likely move would be to extend Saturday hours, and it does seem like expanding hours is always being considered, but I am not aware of any concrete plans at this time.\n\nSource: I am cool with the ghost of Roy Hunt and he tells me stuff",

I've emailed the Assistant Dean of CMU Libraries about the opening hours, and there's apparently been a lot of discussion going on behind the scenes about re-extending the library hours to 24/7.\n\nI have a survey that I'm using to gather student opinions, and hopefully this will be supporting evidence for the Libraries to make the appropriate changes. If you guys fill out the survey (takes 2 minutes max!), I'll pass along these sentiments in an official proposal to the CMU Administration.\n\nhttps://forms.gle/7R1fTC9UYH2zqabW6\n\nBe part of the change you want to see :)",

He will refuse to give it back unless you can provide him with an immaculate donut. This turns out to be a ploy, and not a sincere attempt at a transaction.\n\nYou\u2019ll take a dim view of this vagrant, and will even have police remove him from the library. But as time goes on, you will begin to form an unlikely friendship with this man, who has a wealth of wisdom and a unique perspective on life.\n\nYou might be upset that he took your thesis paper as collateral and he insists that you repay a debt you owe him, and of course you are going to be desperate to get it back. You will try everything you can think of to retrieve your thesis, but he refuses to give it up until you have learned the lessons he believes you need to learn.\n\nAs you interact with him more, you will begin to see the world in a different way. You will come to understand the importance of relationships and experiences over material possessions, and you may start to re-evaluate your priorities both academically and in life. This will have a profound impact on you, and you will eventually become grateful for the lessons he has taught you.\n\nIn the end, you will retrieve your thesis, but it will no longer hold the same importance for you that it once did. Having learned that there is more to life than academic achievement and material wealth, you will find yourself determined to live your life in a way that reflects this new perspective.\n\nThe Hunt library cannot provide this level of enrichment for all students, which is why they must limit their hours.",

I\u2019m an incoming freshman at CMU and have been struggling on figuring out which residence is the \u201cbest.\u201d I\u2019m even more worried since the due date is coming up. I found a roommate and we plan on living in a semi suite. Based on that I would like to hear what everyone thinks is the best dorm to stay in your freshman year. Thank you to everyone in advance!",

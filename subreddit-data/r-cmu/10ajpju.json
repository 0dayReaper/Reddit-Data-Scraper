            "comment": "15-386 is pretty cool, and teaches a mix of things like fourier transforms in audio/image processing, how visual information is processed in the brain, neural networks, etc. \n\nwhen i took it s22 half of the class or so got an a so its definitely doable, and it seems like tai sing lee might make more of 15-386 in python (class was originally taught only in matlab) which imo should make the course assignments a little easier too",

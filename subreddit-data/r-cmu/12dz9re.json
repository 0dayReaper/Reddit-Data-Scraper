I\u2019m currently interested in animation, game design and VR. So I was curious not only what was the general consensus about the school and also how do students do after they graduate? Thank you!",

If the latter, I've got quite the set of true tales about their Arch department over on r/soarchtattler. \n\nIf just the actual art school, then my friends from there seemed to do all right after graduating. They do art still, some do book covers. Others paint. The CFA clusters have both PC and MAC machines ready to do your AV work.",

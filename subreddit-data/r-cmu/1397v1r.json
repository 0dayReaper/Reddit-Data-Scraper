He might have some spare stain you can ask politely for. If not, consider going to Lowes at the waterfront.\n\nStain is not a finish coat. So you may want some polyurethane. I'd recommend spray lacquer but campus doesn't take too kindly to spray cans outside of a dedicated spray booth.",

You should definitely be able to use the little room for wood staining way in the back right area beyond the generic team tables. It has ventilation and all the right equipment but I recall from my woodshop class there that you\u2019re expected to bring your own stain/finishing to apply there. \n\nIf you\u2019re lucky/convincing/polite, maybe the staff there will have something you can use, but I wouldn\u2019t count on it. \n\nLowe\u2019s on waterfront is good, yeah. I believe some of the buses (61D/C maybe?) can take you directly that shopping center from campus if you don\u2019t have a personal transport",

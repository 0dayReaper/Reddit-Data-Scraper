    "postText": "Coming into cmu I had no cs experience and took 112 for a major requirement and enjoyed the class a lot and decided to take more cs courses; however, even though I'm at the point where I've almost completed a cs minor I've found the classes challenging and have been averaging a high C in them. Despite this I still feel the experience has been a lot better than 112 which I had found very challenging. I'm trying to figure out how to address my gaps in the cs core to prevent this trend from continuing and wanted to know how I could address this. I know grades aren't completely representative of one's understanding, but I've found the trend to be alarming and not sure what to do since I devote a lot of time and attention to these courses.",

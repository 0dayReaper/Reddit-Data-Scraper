    "postText": "I took 251 and 210 this past semester and wanted to get some idea of how 213 compares in terms of difficulty and workload before the semester begins. I really didn\u2019t like 122 and haven\u2019t used C in a while, so I\u2019m a bit worried.",

            "comment": "213 is very different. It's a much more hands off class, they teach you concepts and it's on you to learn the specifics on how to code things. I felt the same way about C and 122. I reviewed K&amp;R before the class which helped tremendously. They also have a C refresher lab at the beginning, and it's a pretty good check to see if you know your stuff.\nIn terms of workload I would say 213 is a bit more intense than 251 or 210. It also gives you a bit of rope to hang yourself though. If you manage your time well and start the labs nice and early (especially the later ones), it's really not that bad. Strongly recommend working incrementally (but no one ever does, myself included lol). If you don't wait til the last minute it's also much easier to get help in OH.",

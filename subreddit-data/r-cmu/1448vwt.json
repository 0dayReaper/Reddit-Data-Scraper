    "postText": "Hi (22M), Ive gotten an admit from CMU for one of their graduate security programs (3 semesters). Now although i plan on being a software developer in the future, I do not mind studying a few security courses and taking up software courses as electives.\n\nMy query is that Ive heard studying at CMU is ridiculously hard. Im an average international CS undergraduate student who normally gets decent grades. Will I be able to take the pressure? What if i flunk in a few subjects? What if i dont like the mentioned security subjects which although are foundational courses, are not my area of expertise? \n\nNote : I have ~ 2 years experience as a software developer with good experience with Java and spring -&gt; backend apps, but no background in security.\n\nI have another admit from Northeastern University, Boston for the Software Engineering Systems program, which is comparatively easier to study as per sources and also aligns a little more with my career prospects.\n\nWhat would you suggest / do if you were in my place?",

Question is what you want for yourself, but CMU on your resume in software engineering is difficult to beat.\n\nEveryone goes through the grinder equally. If you fail a few classes, it\u2019s ok. No one looks at your GPA after a few years of work experience.",

If you want to work in information systems, it\u2019s the best there is. If you want to work in more traditional computer science, I suspect that IS would be seen as the degree for those who didn\u2019t get into CS. I.e. if you want to work in robotics, IS is not the way to go.",

            "comment": "I *wouldn't* turn down an opportunity based on hearing that it may be challenging.  There can be a number of reasons to not go the path of CMU, but basing that decision on the difficulty of that path is not a good move.\n\nu/sheepster04 hit the nail on the head: The rigor is proportional to your opportunities you have post graduation.  It may be hard, but that difficulty is rewarded.  These opportunities are somewhat fleeting, and, based on your age and career progression, it likely won't be *too* much longer before being able to challenge yourself like this will be untenable.  You should push yourself now so that you don't regret not doing so later.\n\nNow, with *that* being said, it wouldn't be advantageous to take on an insurmountable challenge that will leave likely leave you with nothing, so I'm not suggesting your considerations are completely unfounded.  But, frankly, I think you're psyching yourself up more than anything.  Yes, CMU is generally challenging, but typically when you hear about how hard it is, you're hearing that come from a specific group of people in a specific program (namely, in the context, undergrads going through the CS program).  I'm not saying they're exaggerating, but school and work generally gets less difficult the longer you do it, even as the actual material gets more complex and challenging.  You just get better at it with practice, and you typically do a better job managing your time and effort as you get older and know yourself better.  What can be extremely challenging for an 18 year old freshman might be a breeze for a 22 year old with professional experience, even if both people are starting at the same point relative to their studies.\n\nIn any case, the thing that seems a bit more concerning is:\n\n&gt;although i plan on being a software developer in the future, I do not mind studying a few security courses and taking up software courses as electives.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What if i dont like the mentioned security subjects which although are foundational courses, are not my area of expertise?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I have another admit from Northeastern University, Boston for the Software Engineering Systems program, which ... also aligns a little more with my career prospects.\n\nYou gotta want it, right?  CMU is great and all, but if another program is more pertinent to your interests, then that other program may be more fruitful.  If that's up in the air, you should try reaching out to professors/students/faculty/etc. directly to get an idea of what this program can truly do for you.  Reddit is a good place to start, but the likelihood of you interacting with the right person on here is very small.",

I am extremely excited that I got into both of these programs, but I am a little bit confused as to which would be better to attend? I\u2019m looking to see which experience would benefit me the most for the time I put in (MITES is around 6 months while CMU Summer Session is around 6 weeks), and which would help me out when applying to colleges the most? Thanks In advance for any help!",

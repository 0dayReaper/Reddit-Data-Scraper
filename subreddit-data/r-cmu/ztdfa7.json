Also working stupid jobs that screwed my sleep schedule, but that's another story.\n\nThe trick to getting reinstated was to have a good chat with your advisor, understand and be able to explain what you screwed up, and give them some hope that you can, you know, not do that again.  Your advisor is the one who has to approve you returning.  \n\nSo go chat with them now, and ask them when you'd need to chat next, and between those two, do some work, do some thinking, watch some teevee, think about it some more, then go chat with 'em the second time.",

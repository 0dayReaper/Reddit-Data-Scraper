And best of all, housing services seems to be AWOL and not care about ANY of this. \n\nIs this standard for nearly all CMU housing? (and perhaps standard for anything non-academic related at CMU?)",

With the new ones on Fifth Ave, Morewood Gardens post renovation, and the new building coming up on Forbes and Beeler, there definitely are better options than Wesnik. I don't mind it so much but I really wish there were water fountains on each floor... I feel like Resnik is a downgrade from Morewood imo",

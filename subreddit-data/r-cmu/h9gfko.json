    "postText": "Dear Dr. Skinner,\n\nI saw Richard Grenell has been brought on as a senior fellow. I'm impressed! Now that I know the standards are so low, I thought I'd also apply.  \nI believe I fit the qualifications admirable. I assure you that I am not only personally abrasive, offensive, opportunistic, and deeply sycophantic, I am also weirdly ineffectual, intellectually and personally, toward my stated goals.\n\nWhile I do not have as much experience as Mr. Grenell, I believe hiring me will equally show the institute's colossal poor judgement and ability to waste time and resources.\n\nRespectfully yours, &amp;c &amp;c.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nDo you think it is plausible for me to take 15351 after only taking 15112 and 15122? For reference, I got an A in 15112, and will likely get a high B in 15122. Will this prepare me enough for the class&gt; If not, what else should I take first?\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "You should be fine. 21-228 or 15-251 would be nice to have under your belt, but they're by no means necessary; it's just good to know basics of Graph theory. Also, fwiw, the course has a lot of synergy with Operations Research I &amp; II in the Math department (21-292 and 21-393).\n\nThere is more content covered in 351 and consequently topics aren't covered as deeply (i.e. less motivated by concrete underlying basics / principles/ theories), so be prepared for a different style for the way the material is presented vs 112 or 122. Part of that is because the course is cross-listed as a grad course in both the CS Dept and (Comp?) Bio departments, so the focus is more on practical application. Relatedly, there are a lot of digressions into algorithms that are more relevant to comp bio (e.g., string comparison with a framing around DNA sequences), though these are mostly still interesting for non-bio people.",

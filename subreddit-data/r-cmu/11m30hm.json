    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI am from school of architecture and I wanted to know my chances of getting into the physical education classes. I wanted to enroll in the A4 sections for spring 2023 however I'm on waitlist for all of them. On 5th, 6th, 22nd, 33rd place on the waitlist. I have emailed the professors but none of them is responding. Do u think I can still get in? \n\nI actually have to drop a course which brings me down to 33 units but I have to take 3 more units to maintain my visa status as I am an international student. I am looking for mini courses I can register into in the second half of the semester.",

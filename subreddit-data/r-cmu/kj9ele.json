    "postText": "People ask this question every year here, on Facebook groups, etc. I'm hoping people are searching the sub before posting, and so, here we are: the answers. I've lived in Pittsburgh my whole life, save for a couple of semesters away. I definitely meant to post this in August but I completely forgot.\n\n**What's the weather like in Pittsburgh?**\n\nWe have all the seasons: summer, hotter summer, fall, wet fall, winter, colder winter, wet spring, and regular spring.\n\nSummer is basically mid May through late September; it gets hot, and it is humid. The result: it's sticky and uncomfortable. When you are moving in, do not expect it to be a nice, cool, crisp fall day. It will be *very warm* and humid, and it will stay that way for about a month at the start of school. Bring your summer clothes! Get some use out of them. While it's not reliably summer-y until May, it does usually start to get a lot warmer by mid to late April, and you can probably wear summer clothes again! Be ready! **Clothing to remember includes whatever you like in the summer- dresses, shorts, tank tops, whatever.** If you're a party person, you can bring going out clothes for hot days, too. (Please don't party in a pandemic, though. This is general advice.) At night, it typically cools down, though the humidity doesn't always go away. By mid-September, expect night to be considerably cooler than day. Personally, September nights - temp around the 60s, humidity down - is my favorite time of year. **From the above list, summer is about mid May to mid June, and mid June on is hotter summer.**\n\nFall starts around late September. The humidity starts to go away some, and it cools down a lot. It's fall weather until mid November, with lots of grey and lots of rain. We are a pretty damp city. That's just how it goes. These are the crisper, cooler days, but it does get wet. **You need waterproof shoes.** If you wear tennis shoes that are not water-proofed throughout fall, but especially winter, you are asking to get uncomfortable. You can buy waterproofing spray for pretty cheap! I remember my entire hallway in my freshman dorm realizing at once around this time that they needed waterproof shoes, and buying some cans of the spray and all doing their shoes at once. If you're not familiar with it, it's less than ten bucks a can and you can use it on your backpack, too. **(Read: waterproof your backpack!)** You can get it at Walmart, Target, other places. Split one can with a bunch of people. It takes about two days to spray, dry, spray again, and fully dry, depending on what kind you get, so I'd either 1) not do everything at once or 2) do it plenty early so you can wear shoes that don't need waterproofed. **Fall is chilly. Bring pants, waterproof shoes, warm socks, a jacket or two, and a solid umbrella.** I highly recommend getting the kind of umbrella that gets very small, and just leave it in your backpack full-time. The weather can change in a second; I can't even tell you how many times it's been sunny in the distance, with breaks in the clouds up above you, and... it starts to pour. It's not all the time, but it happens. **Also, get into the habit of checking the weather.** I said it's generally chilly, I know, but it's not unheard of to have a 50 degree day (or night) in September, or a 70 degree day in October. It's also pretty normal to see one day that's very hot and humid and one day that's chilly and rainy, back-to-back. **It's also great sweater weather.** Even when it's cooler in the summer, it's usually pretty humid; fall, though, is great for warm layers.\n\nWinter starts around mid-November; it gets *very cold*. As a side note, CMU's campus is very open; personally, I think we need a lot more trees, but that's a separate conversation. That means that when it's hot and sunny, campus is extra hot and there's very little shade to hide in. When it's rainy, there's very little coverage. When it's cold and windy, there's little protection. Same with most of Oakland and Squirrel Hill. **Starting around mid November, you will need a coat. A real winter coat.** You're also going to want a hat, gloves, and a scarf. It's not the cold that will get you. It can get very cold here, yes; however, it's the wind chill that's bad. It's pretty rare that it gets below zero here, but the windchill gets below zero several times a year. **If you are from a warm place and do not own a coat, you can absolutely just buy one when you get here.** They will be available in stores starting around October or early November, and that's early enough to be safe. **Expect to get in the habit of layering.** Think a t-shirt, then a sweater, maybe a light jacket, then a nice coat. I'm not a big fan of hoods, but that's just personal preference- hoods are a great practical choice. When it's especially windy and cold, having a hood over your hat + scarf is truly wonderful. Fingerless gloves are also pretty great - I really love the ones that turn into mittens. **Warm socks are also a lifesaver.**\n\nThe coldest months are **January and February**. Temperature drops, and this is **also when it actually gets snowy.** Here's the thing about snow in Pittsburgh: it... usually melts very quickly. **You should expect a lot more slush and ice than snow.** For that reason, you want your shoes to be **waterproof.** For most of my life, I've chosen \"combat\" style boots (currently living in some Docs) or \"fashionably acceptable\" but functional hiking boots, and they're my staple shoe from October to March. **It's really wet here, guys. I'm sorry.** Pair your boots with warm socks, though, and you'll be okay.\n\nAnother note here: the wind chill will always get you, and the campus is actually quite open. Lots of wide green spaces with relatively few trees. Oakland and Squirrel Hill have green spaces and lots of buildings, but are still fairly open. As a student, you'll likely be relying on walking and buses to get around. **Bring a scarf and a hat.** You'll be forever grateful to have something to wrap around your face. There have been days where I seriously wish I had worn goggles to protect my eyes from the wind as I walk to Oakland for real food.\n\nWinter starts to fade out at the beginning of March. It's still chilly- don't get rid of that coat yet. There might even be days in March where it snows, days when it's as cold as it was in February. However, March is when it usually starts to get a little warmer again. It becomes more rainy than snowy. It becomes jacket weather, instead of absolutely freezing. By Carnival in April, the weather is warmer, albeit still with plenty of rain. April is my favorite \"warm\" month because it's not as sticky out from the humidity yet, with May as a close second.\n\nThe weather is also very, very fickle. Get a small umbrella and keep it in your backpack. You'll thank me later.\n\n**What clothes to pack?**\n\nThat depends entirely on what you want to wear. I'd say you're best off having a comfortable jacket and a warm coat. Layer them on particularly warm days, rely on that coat through most of the winter, and use that jacket around October-November and March-April. Waterproof shoes are a must, as are warm socks in the winter. Waterproof your backpack and consider getting a water resistant laptop sleeve, as well. I have definitely gotten on buses before and sat down only to realize that the top of my backpack has a literal puddle on top- but thanks to waterproofing spray, a water resistant sleeve, and a well-placed plastic bag I keep permanently in my backpack, everything is safe inside.\n\n**Edit to add: TLDR It's grey and wet most of the year and deathly humid the rest.** ",

Nice post!\n\nOne suggestion: compare it to other cities in the region; the entire audience for this is from, well, somewhere else.\n\nPittsburgh's weather is basically northeastern.  The climate is less hot and humid than Washington, DC, and is very similar to NYC (but with less rain).  But yup, more cloudy days; we're not coastal, and are just upwind of some mountains. \n\nOr, I'd take this over Boston or Chicago winters.  ;-)",

You can turn it down as low as 56\u00b0 F (13\u00b0C), but absolutely not any lower. Winter in Pittsburgh can be so cold that leftover water in pipes can freeze and cause the pipes to burst.

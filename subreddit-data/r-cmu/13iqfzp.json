    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture. After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.\n\nIf there is one thing the university was never famous for, it would be fast and problem-free elevators. Every building has the one elevator known for issues. In Maggie Mo, the archies have a so-called \u201cfun\u201d tradition with theirs.\n\nI am not talking about pressing all the buttons to annoy grad students trying to get to the top floor. Nor is it about drawing graffiti on the doors in such a manner as to suggest crude acts via the doors opening and closing. This particular tradition was passed down year after year and is perhaps more dangerous than the [circuit around the front colonnade](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/n7f6dh/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_4_the_maggie_mo/).\n\nImmediately following any lecture in the basement or first floor lecture hall, students rushed to cram themselves into the elevator cab back up to studio. Out of boredom, a few figured out that by jumping in unison, they could throw the machine out of sync with its pre-programmed floor levels. A few good solid smacks down onto the cab flooring and the elevator would shake violently, producing shrieks from frightened passengers who were certain of their impending doom at the bottom of the shaft. \n\nThe doors would then open two or sometimes three feet below floor level. Students would have to climb out like mountaineers to reach the third floor studio corridor. It is unclear how the elevator was able to correct itself for future stops but it was always easy to offset with this jumping tradition to which I and so many other archies were given an unwilling firsthand introduction.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d",

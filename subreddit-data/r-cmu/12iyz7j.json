    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture. After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.\n\nOne third year studio, there was a kid cursed with always going first for weekly reviews. I can\u2019t quite say why he was always picked in particular as the sacrifice to the professor, but considering the professor always spent the most time on the first victim in every class (sometimes as much as an hour or more), this afforded the rest of his classmates plenty of time to either improvise something or gamble the clock will run out before it was their turn for the grilling.\n\nWeek after week, he was constantly first, and not by choice. Whenever he signed up fourth or fifth on the review roster, classmates would scratch out their names and rewrite them below the kid. When the professor asked who would like to go first, someone would nominate him. After half a semester, things were getting old. His only fortune, and perhaps the reason for his misery, was that he always had something prepared for studio every day. There were no \u201coff days\u201d for him, and looking at how things were going, there were be no room for slacking.\n\nOne day, after being nominated again to go first, the kid gave yet another presentation and endured forty-five minutes of discussion about his project. The babbling brook of an instructor would intermittently ask questions relating to the studio project as a whole and colleagues would look up from their smart phones and chime in to appear intellectually engaged. Finally, the teacher concluded the long initial review with a call for the next student.\n\nWithout skipping a beat, the exhausted kid looked into the eyes of the one who had called him for the umpteenth time to go first and called her to be next.\n\nThe professor agreed and turned to that student. After appearing thoroughly engaged with the project and quite conversational during the first kid\u2019s review, this second student finally had to admit she had nothing for that day. The professor was disappointed and after looking at her notes, reminded the blushing student that she had not seen her work for quite a few classes as others had been going before her. The student pulled the sick card but the instructor sternly warned her to have something ready for next class. The slacker threw a murderous glare at the kid who was cracking a sly grin at her being exposed.\n\nFrom then on, the kid\u2019s misfortune of going first abated. Professors were soon catching on to the strategy some were using to hide behind the long initial reviews and corrected it by personally deciding the order of student reviews for the day, thus ensuring everyone had, at the minimum, a proper review once or twice every week.\n\nAs for the kid, well, one misfortune deserves another; for he was then constantly selected by professors to be the closing presentation for final reviews. As the last opportunity for professors to express their thoughts, last place was always the longest to finish on those days.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d",

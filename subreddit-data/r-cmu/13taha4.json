Yours might already be answered!\n\nPlease consider posting to subs like /r/pittsburgh for general life in Pittsburgh questions, dedicated subs like /r/chanceme, /r/ApplyingToCollege, and /r/collegeresults for odds of getting accepted, and using the search in the sidebar.\n\n^(If I've misidentified your post, please ignore this message and instead take it as a reminder to contribute your own answers to the megathread.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "comment": "afaik there are no dorms with internally separate rooms. so, choose based on whether you want a private kitchen and bathroom (choose apartment style) or you\u2019re fine with a floor kitchen and shared bathroom (dorm style). I\u2019d then pick based on if a dorm has a printer / gym / cool common areas if you\u2019re interested in using those. for example, if you\u2019re a musician, fifth and clyde has full music rooms and morewood has soundproof practice rooms. do some exploring on the housing website, see what you like.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm a high school student and was interested in the Statistics and Machine Learning Major offered through the Dietrich College at CMU. I've found that CMU admits by college, but does CMU admit by major within the college as well? For example, is it easier/harder to be admitted to Dietrich as a creative writing major than to be admitted to Dietrich as a StatML major? I saw some things about this on Reddit but they weren't clear.\n\nSecondly, if CMU does admit by major with Dietrich, is StatML one of the harder majors to get into?\n\nThank you and I would really appreciate a response!!",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm a StatsML major! Dietrich in particular does not admit students into specific majors. In your application you can select what major you're interested in, but once you're admitted, you're admitted as an undeclared Dietrich major. If you then accept and go to CMU, you can choose to declare any major within Dietrich, regardless of what you listed on your initial application. The only exception is Dietrich's Information Systems major, which you either have to list on your CMU application or transfer in. If you want to declare any major outside of Dietrich, you'd have to apply for a transfer. \n\nSo by nature of the admissions program, StatsML isn't harder to get in than any other Dietrich major other than IS. It's probably still good to make sure the major you list on your application makes sense given your other materials (extracurriculars, essays, maybe rec letters etc), but I'm honestly not sure how much the admissions board cares which major you list.",

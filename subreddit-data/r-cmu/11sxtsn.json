            "comment": "Be wary with CMU housing (especially in Facebook) since there are a number of scams. I would say rent an apartment which will include all utilities (usually except wifi), but if you know other people, then a house would be ideal just make sure though that the house is near bus stops. If utilities are not included, make sure to renegotiate electric and gas because the uptick in bills during winter and summer will definitely be a lot. Just a tip on your search, do a google maps search and narrow down the apartments/houses you like then look for their websites and give them a call. They usually offer virtual tours so you can see the property prior to deciding.",

Some folks don't mind, but advising CMU students, particularly grad students, to avoid Oakland to avoid Pitt students and parties is a reoccurring theme on /r/cmu.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I was born in south Oakland and lived in north Oakland my entire time at CMU. My experience was that north Oakland was quieter than central Oakland, and on occasions when I ventured into Oakland on weekends I didn't mind the parties.",

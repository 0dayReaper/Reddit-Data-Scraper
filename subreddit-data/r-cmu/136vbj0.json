    "postText": "Hi, if anyone has recommendations for a photographer in the Pittsburgh area, please let me know!\n\nMy group is looking for someone to take graduation photos of us sometime in the next 10ish days on the few days we have nice weather (aka no rain or freezing wind). Ideally on 5/6, 5/7, 5/9, or 5/13.\n\nI say photographer but anyone who has a nice camera with basic photography skills that we can hire would be nice! :) It would also be great if you could do some basic photo editing or if you have a gallery we could look at.\n\nObviously we would compensate for the time we have you booked as well as editing time and travel time if you're located a bit further.\n\nAny leads would be really appreciated, thanks!",

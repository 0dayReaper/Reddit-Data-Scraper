    "postText": "Hey everyone, I am a current senior in high school who got accepted into the architecture program at CMU. I haven\u2019t seen that many posts on the major so I have a couple of questions. \n\n1. How is the workload? I know CMU is notorious for heavy workloads and I think architecture is similar no matter where you go, so how bad is it? Do you have any free time or is it always work? \n\n2. How are the courses themselves? What are the best parts about the classes you have taken and the worst parts?\n\n3. General question: How do you guys manage stress? Is there any wok life balance at all? \n\n4. General question: How hard was it to adjust to life at CMU after high school? What was the easiest part about your freshman year and the hardest? \n\nThank you all in advance for your advice :)",

            "comment": "Architecture workload is all about time management. You can sit in studio for 6 hours working on a model, but in actuality you talked to friends for 90 minutes, zoned out watching Netflix for another hour, and then went and got food for another hour, meaning your 6 hour studio day was 2.5 hours of work. \n\nIf you go to studio and get done what you need to get done and leave, you will never need to pull an all nighter (I never did). You loose out on some of the social qualities then, but that\u2019s a balance you can strike. Never fall into the trap of having FOMO for all nighter studio camaraderie. It\u2019s not worth it. \n\nThere were semesters I was more busy and ones where I had lots of free time, mostly owing to differences in Studio professors. My last semester I only took studio because I had finished up my course load early. I finished two minors and ran a large student org at my time at CMU, so everything is possible!\n\nFreshman year wasn\u2019t easy. I came from a rigorous high school so the classwork itself wasn\u2019t a massive jump, but architecture work is so different from any classes you take in high school- you kind of have to relearn how to learn. I tell people often, the work doesn\u2019t get easier over the years, you just gain sooo many new skills and ways to approach it.",

            "comment": "Survivor here. Graduated with B-arch and MSSD degrees. \n\nWorkload is high but I managed to do all my semesters without spending a single all nighter in studio, despite working four jobs a semester and doing two additional minors of study. If you manage your time well, you will get things done in a timely manner. Get the right tools too, like a transparent triangle with steel edge to run your exato blade alongside to make straight cuts faster for models. \n\nFirst two years will feel like boot camp. As much as the professors hate us saying so, it is boot camp where they will try to weed out those who's hearts aren't really into architecture. Third year on, it gets easier, especially with most of your gen ed courses done so you can focus on architecture. \n\nThe courses are what you make of them. Like arch history? Plenty of those classes. Like digital design and fabrication? Check out Dfab. \n\nThe biggest stress may not always be the courseload but \"Studio Culture\" as you are all grouped together for five years and bad apples will be bad apples and the office brass isn't exactly well competent in dealing with bullies, snobs, etc. Best advice is chances are you'll be fine but if bullies do anything to you, go to the police and take it out of Soarch's hands. (Shuffle Fiasco of 2014). \n\nIf you want to see slice of life in studio in general, I've archived true tales from my time there as part of a [personal but unauthorized history project about Soarch](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/) that you and other future archies can see for yourselves.",

Use notebook and pencil because the profs are old and will assume students are using tech to browse the web in lecture. Some will outright forbid any tech on the desk. Do get a gamer class of laptop since 3d modeling and other cad programs / adobe creative suite require similar specs as video games. Get a portable HD to back up your data as things happen. Invest in good headphones with replaceable audio cable. Will need a smartphone as some profs will email minutes before class and expect you to have read them.",

            "comment": "As another B.Arch survivor (lol) I agree with the other person\u2019s comment about studio culture being one of the hardest aspects and will add that general CMU culture was also a major stressor during my time there as a student. Challenging academics aside, I felt a tremendous amount of emotional/social stress my entire time at CMU. If you have a good group of friends and a strong support system you will be fine. I think it\u2019s also important to make friends outside of studio and participate in things around campus that are not architecture related. There are plenty of great options. I became really close with a few people on my floor in my freshman year dorm and they\u2019re still my best friends today. \n\nYou have to truly have a strong passion for architecture to survive the program. If you do then you will enjoy studio (especially 4th and 5th year advanced studios) - there are some exceptional staff members in the school of architecture and great resources.",

Ended up making friends with CS majors and engineers.  Also found a Christian group or two that helped (IV and ACF,  though I'm not Asian, some there were quite friendly toward me and helpful).  Personally, I found the homework to not be the most stressful part of my time at CMU, but studio culture.  But like you, I survived everything. LOL",

There are many resources there you may not find in other smaller or local arch schools. You can spread your wings here and pursue a flight of education and research unlike any other. You are limited only by your imagination. However, also based on my experiences, I can not say it will be always an easy or fun time. There's a lot of homework, sure; but the biggest disappointment I felt was how my peers in the class of 2014 treated me and other \"outsiders\" and how certain staff failed to adequately handle the situations that occurred with \"studio culture.\" However, my Class 2014 seems to be the extreme in this regard and subsequent years have not had the issues mine did stemming from a certain group of bad apples doing all that (rich kids turned bullies and manipulators). So I don't think you'll have any of the heartaches I felt. You should be fine with your peers here and you'll find yourself accomplishing more amazing things with team projects. \n\nWork after graduating can be a mixed bag. If you do internships  in actual firms in the summer, you'll be fine. People will look at it along with the CMU name and it should open doors. If you only do research and other projects for CMU during the summers, they may think CMU B-arch babysat you and you don't have \"real\" work experience. To get around this, you can stay an extra year and get a Master's Degree in something, which I did. If you get a Grad degree from CMU on top of the B-arch, people will know you're used to hard work and they'll treat you better.  You may even get specialized work because of the degrees. \n\nDo I think my experience was worth it?\n\nThat's the quarter million dollar question indeed.",

If you get a roomie, they may be decided by that Myers Brigg personality test you can take to avoid personality clashes. Dorms are typically by same sex unless you specifically ask for mixed and first year roomies tend to be same major. However, starting second year, you can pair up with friends for dorms or seek to rent apartments off campus, which can be much cheaper than CMU housing if you pick neighborhoods outside Squirrel Hill/Downtown/Shadyside.",

Of those 25 people - 4 I know are in architecture as a profession and the pay they receive after 10 years in the field is less than 100k a year (most are NYC based, so that is barely cost of living). The first day of my internship in my second year- two people literally said \u201cget out of this while you can\u201d. This is not a slight to CMU, or the program, but this is a commitment than you need to be willing to struggle financially for a long time to to maybbeee make a decent living. Most people in my year moved into design, systems engineering, and software development careers and we have all had much better salary and work like balance by a mile.",

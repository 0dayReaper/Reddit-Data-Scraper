    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an ECE freshman. I took 21-122 my first semester and am planning to take 21-127 next semester. I was wondering if for sophomore year I should take 21-254 or 21-241. I want to have a solid understanding of linear algebra and don\u2019t want to sacrifice knowledge that could potentially be important for machine learning by taking 21-254 (since I know it covers some vector calc too). \n\n\nI also really want to take 21-260, so 21-254 sounds more convenient as I\u2019d have some multivariable calc under my belt. Should I just go for 21-254 then? Or is 21-241 worth taking if I really want a good understanding of matrices and linear algebra? Thank you so much in advance.",

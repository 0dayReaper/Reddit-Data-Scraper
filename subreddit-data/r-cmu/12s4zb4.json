    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an incoming freshman at cmu and was wondering about rooming. My roommate and I would prefer getting a double room, as we will put that as our preference on the housing app. We are not opposed to a quad, however we are significantly opposed to a triple. \n\nTherefore, can our 1st building option be a dorm with triples, quads, etc., as long as we select our preference for a double room? If so, is there a high chance of getting randomly put into a triple, for example, even if we put preferences for a double/connecting double. \n\nI\u2019d love to know anyone\u2019s experience with this.",

Of course for suites you'll have more people but in one room there are at max three residents I think. Also, I don't think you'll be randomly put into a triple because there are very few triples on campus and those rooms have different rates etc. If you are in a roommate group of two currently in the application you'll only be placed into doubles.",

Yeah I didn\u2019t know if they had quads here, I just knew that my other schools did so I assumed \n\nThe only reason we were wondering tbh was because it happened to my roommates sister (she requested double w one other roommate and another girl got randomly assigned w them in the summer). So I think we are just paranoid now lmao.",

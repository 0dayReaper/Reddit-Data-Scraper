    "postText": "I got accepted into a CMU Master's program (ME-AI) and really would love to attend but can't afford to pay 80k a year. I've asked several professors about receiving funding from their lab but every one has come back to me and said they don't have any funds for Master's students. \n\nI finally spoke with Dr. Geyer who told me it was fairly uncommon for Master's students to recieve funding, as it is usually reserved for PhDs. \n\nCan anyone confirm or deny this? I'm going to keep asking around just in case but would like to know the odds as I keep digging.",

The MS Robotics program has an expectation of sorts to be partly funded, and thus faculty are likely to fund. Other programs, not so much.",

If your MA of choice is not openly advertising a partial tuition funding, the odds are it does no exist.",

You need to be hired as a full time employee by CMU, which would probably take a few months to happen even if they had open positions that you qualify for. At which point you then have to wait 6 months, after which you get tuition waived. The catch is you have to keep working full time so you can probably take one class each semester AND you pay taxes on the tuition as it counts as a payment to you. \n\nFor context on how I know this I spoke to a CMU employee who did this to get her masters.",

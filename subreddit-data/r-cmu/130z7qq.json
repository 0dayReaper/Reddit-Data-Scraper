    "postText": "Not really a question, they probably did just for the money. Feels annoying that they knowingly took on so many students though, and then say \"due to the size of the incoming class, we cannot schedule appointments with the advising team\". Is there a ton of competition for classes at CMU? I've heard that other colleges have placement exams for highly coveted classes, because there's tons of people and few seats, so I'm worried they'll start doing the same for CS/ECE.",

            "comment": "Also, it might not have been done knowingly. Every year they have to guess how many students that were extended offers will actually accept--that rate is around 20% lots of times. But there's nothing preventing some fluke where everyone that got an offer chooses to actually accept and go to CMU.\n\nI mean, they probably wanted to get as close as possible to the maximum amount of students to make more money, but I would bet there was also some effect like that.",

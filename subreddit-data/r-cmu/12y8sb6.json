    "postText": "I have chosen MS ECE as MS CS is highly competitive in CMU. My main goal is to get job in SDE after the graduation. I have planned to take up 18-613 DEFINITELY. I need some guidance on what are the other courses that I can take up so that it is relevant more for me during the SDE roles after graduation? I have to take up 5 courses in ECE core course work, 2 as CIT, and 1 as General technical elective course. Please guide.",

    "postText": "\n\n1 br has a private bath and walk in closet\n\n1 br has its own shower but shares a toilet with the other br on its floor. \n\nMy 2 other roommates are graduating this semester so I\u2019m looking for 2 people to take over their position on the lease. The lease starts in June and lasts for a year. The landlord is not increasing rent. Rent is ~1000$ a month with water included, electricity is additional. The house has gigabit fiber. It is approximately a 20 minute walk to campus, a 4-6 minute spin and a 5-10 minute bike ride. Walking distance from aldi/geagle, highland ave, super close to walnut street. 5 minute walk to bus stop. The house is also super close to a cmu escort shuttle stop. \n\nThe house is ~1800-2000 sq ft with a fully furnished kitchen and in unit washer dryer. The house was renovated in March 2022. Please reach out if you\u2019re interested I can show you the place in person or over facetime.",

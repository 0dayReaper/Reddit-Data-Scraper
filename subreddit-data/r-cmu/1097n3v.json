    "postText": "Hello all, \n\nI'm Harrison one of the instructors of 98-242 Introduction to Esoteric Programming Languages/ Esolangs!! In esolangs, yall get to relax and explore the fun side of programming languages and discover programming from a different perspective. You will learn about tons of new languages that are both silly and interesting and have some practical lessons sprinkled in along the way. The class is on Wednesday 7-7:50pm so if you are free then yall should sign up. Very minimal to no programming experience is required to enjoy the class!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, if you are on the waitlist, show up to class anyway and we will be able to get you off in the first few weeks",

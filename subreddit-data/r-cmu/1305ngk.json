    "postText": "I'm currently less than a week away from committing and wanted to get the input of some CMU students, preferably architecture students. I recently visited the campus, and I loved it and the city of Pittsburgh in general, but I got the sense that social life and happiness needed to be improved. In contrast, when I visited USC, I got a completely different sense, but being an Asian guy from the east coast, it's hard not to expect some cultural disconnect with the general student population at USC. Essentially, the merits (for me) of going to CMU are the location and the cultural connection (east coast and Asianness). The deterrents are happiness.  Appreciate any advice :)",

Now being close to family is an important factor but thats really up to you to decide if only seeing your family on long breaks and special occasions is a dealbreaker. College really is an excellent opportunity to try something new and different, but I also understand some want to be close to family. CMU and USC are very different schools culturally, as I think you could tell. LA and PGH are also quite different. Not going to lie, USC does seem pretty awesome (sports, parties, LA, etc) but I also had a great time at CMU when I wanted to. \n\nIn terms of architecture, I assume you are pursuing the B.Arch as an incoming freshman at both schools? The experience is pretty universal - long hours but rewarding work if you are really into architecture. That will be the same at both schools. Can\u2019t speak to USC\u2019s facilities but CMUs are - meh (for architecture). Faculty for the most part are great. A final thing to consider may be job opportunities/network post grad. Connections made in school with students/faculty can open up great opportunities. Obviously USC\u2019s alumni base is more heavily west coast concentrated. CMU more east coast, but with a decent presence out west as well.",

I originally chose my undergrad over CMU because of the \u201chappiness\u201d vibes and a better cultural fit. I will say that now having attended both, CMU\u2019s work culture is quite a bit more dour. Despite this, both places have had wonderful people (students and locals) and lots of active student life. Regardless of where you choose, you\u2019ll find your niche and your people, so in my opinion, you should focus on the merits of each school architecture department and which school can best get you where you want to be career and location-wise in 6-10 years from now.",

            "comment": "As an Arch alumni with two degrees from CMU and as the notorious chronicler of life in architecture studio there, let me offer my two cents.\n\nArchitecture is going to be tough, no matter which school you go to. I visited other schools in Florida before moving to CMU and the consensus was the same as to having a ton of work to do. Going to a place that seems happier may make you feel even lonelier as you're stuck working on models all the time while other the majors soak up the California/Florida sun. \n\nThe first secret is to make yourself happy, to find joy in what you do for school and in your personal time. Students here like to boast about working all the time but they do have their happy social lives, even Archies.  The second secret is that at CMU architecture, the first two years are like boot camp but afterwards it gets easier and you'll have time to pursue other studies or get a big social life. The brass hates us telling others this but that's how it works and they know it. The third secret is there is a lot that goes in studio life that you won't see on the brochure or in a tour. I've done my best to document the best and worst histories at cmu and soarchtattler subreddits so people can decide for themselves about studio culture. \n\nFamily is also important. You might appreciate their visiting more frequently on the East Coast than only between semesters out West. \n\nCheers and good luck whichever you decide.",

                            "comment": "Life at CMU SoA is very busy, especially that first two years as you deal with gen ed classes on top of arch courses. There's a lot of opportunities to explore between woodshop, digital fabrication, and other things you learn to use in your research. Overall, if you do the work, you will pass. And you'll find the time to do student part time jobs, other studies, socialize, or delve into your hobbies/personal pursuits. \n\nAs for studio culture, it varies from year to year. (Most would consider my year to be an extreme.) Usually you find comradery within your year and develop cliques. Eventually, you'll branch out to other years and make friends with TAs or those in your group for projects that span across the years. You'll spend a lot of time in studio, working, eating, or sometimes sleeping so you might consider it home instead of your dorm, depending on how efficient you are at work or if the profs all have the same deadline. Basically treat it like an open air office. I've seen some people show up in pajamas on the weekends. Your desk is your space and people will bring things to personalize their areas.",

The only dorm that\u2019s kind of far is Res on Fifth, which is about a five minute walk from campus but it\u2019s right next to upperclassmen dorms. Forbes Ave and Fifth Ave see a lot of traffic, so walking farther from campus might get dangerous at night like any city but Pittsburgh is really safe for the most part.",

I went to CMU the Fall of 1981 and I had a woman schizophrenic for a roommate. The school had endless arguments why I couldn't be moved, but my parents and I prevailed, and I moved a cross the hall.",

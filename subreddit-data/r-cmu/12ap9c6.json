Yours might already be answered!\n\nPlease consider posting to subs like /r/pittsburgh for general life in Pittsburgh questions, dedicated subs like /r/chanceme, /r/ApplyingToCollege, and /r/collegeresults for odds of getting accepted, and using the search in the sidebar.\n\n^(If I've misidentified your post, please ignore this message and instead take it as a reminder to contribute your own answers to the megathread.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In terms of costs of living there is a pamphlet from the grad student government that breaks down where most students live and average rent: https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/Resources-for-Graduate-Students/gsa-housing-guide-updated-3.7.19.pdf with respect to needs such as food and leisure it ranges but the campus also has resources for those who need some supplementary help in the form of the free campus pantry https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/resources/cmu-pantry/",

I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re at in your education or your career - but as someone who has been in \u201ccorporate America\u201d for 12 years now - the college you attended doesn\u2019t matter as much as we\u2019re led to believe it does.",

As someone who transferred to CMU, I would say it heavily depends on your interests and what you think other schools offer that CMU doesn\u2019t have. There are opportunities for people to get involved especially within the public policy realm, but it takes a bit of searching. It would also help to understand exactly what you\u2019re dissatisfied with be it through academics, job opportunities, extracurriculars, etc. If your plan is to go to law school, I would say whether your transfer or not will not make a significant difference so long as your GPA and LSAT are strong. However, I would try to heed advise from fellow humanities majors. Those in stem tend to be ignorant to the opportunities available to us, so if you\u2019re able to speak to more students in your college/major, I think you\u2019ll get a more accurate perspective to guide your decision on this.  (Which could be helpful given the comments that I\u2019m seeing)",

One of the things I love most about CMU is the flexibility of its programs. There are also definitely [educational opportunities connected to politics](https://www.cmu.edu/ips/undergraduate-degrees/index.html) if that's what you want to pursue. However, doing so will require more effort/selection on your part than following a preset politics/liberal arts major at another school. \n\nBUT the way you describe staying at CMU as \"sticking it out\" makes me think that you are not enjoying your time there. If you do not enjoy CMU both academically and socially, then I think you should transfer (which I would say of any school you are not happy at).",

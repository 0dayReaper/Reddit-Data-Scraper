Specifically recommendations on safe/affordable/nice? places to live.  Fwiw I will also be bringing a car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Welcome to CMU! The majority of grad students I know live in Squirrel Hill or Shadyside, but honestly there are so many other great neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. I have friends that live in Bloomfield, Regent Square, Greenfield, Friendship, Garfield, the Strip District, and Regent Square, and I live in South Side Flats. \n\nA lot of it comes down to your own priorities, how close you want to be to campus, if you want to walk/bike/bus to campus, how much you want to pay, if you want to live in an apartment/townhouse/house, etc. Each neighborhood has its own feel, which you'll pick up on once you're here, but it's hard to know the feel from just reading online.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Let me know if you're looking for something specific where you wanna live.",

            "comment": "Most grad students are in Shadyside or Squirrel Hill (two of the more expensive neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, but if you're coming from any of the expensive coastal cities this will still be cheap to you). I live in Squirrel Hill which I do like. Sometimes I wished I lived somewhere with less CMU students because sometimes I want to get away other students (we bitch about school too much, especially CMU students, myself included). Nice neighborhoods that I would consider, if I wanted to be away from students: Mt. Washington (especially if you find a place with a view!), Lawrenceville, Highland Park, the neighborhood to the north of Allegheny Commons.",

Yes, Squirrel Hill has a lot of CMU students BUT it depends on the area. Squirrel Hill South is FULL of CMU students but Squirrel Hill North has more families and non-students. Goodluck!",

Would you need a car at either/both places? How's the parking situation if you need a car?\n\nThanks for the info provided so far in this thread.",

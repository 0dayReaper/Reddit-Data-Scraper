I'm a rising freshmen at CMU SCS and I am fearing for my life.\n\nWhat's an **attainable** GPA that an average CS student should strive to maintain (perhaps something that's relatively difficult to reach. Something that can be treated as a goal)? What's a range of acceptable/great GPAs? What's the average?\n\nAlso, pls have answers be healthy goals. Not ones too high that will ruin mental health and be detrimental in the long run, and not ones too low, or below average.",

Both in an abstract \"grades are just a number\" way and a literal \"no-one cares even a month after graduation\" way (if all you want is a number, there are cheaper and easier ways to get it). What grades / GPA are helpful for is for calibration.  \n\n\nAn A can indicate you gel well with a subject and might want to dig in deeper (ie a related class, research, TA'ing, open source, etc.). All A's can mean you could probably handle more / harder classes.   \n\n\nA C is totally ok as long as you know why you got it (maybe you needed to practice before tests more, or maybe you decided another class or more sleep was more important that those few extra points on a lab). Getting mostly C's might mean you are overextended or need to go to office hours more often (or it could just be bad luck / a rough semester).",

            "comment": "If I remember correctly the average GPA for SCS undergrad is around 3.5. If you could maintain a 3.75 or above I think that places you in the top 25% of your peers. So if you want an attainable GPA, you could aim for 3.75 and this will place you on the SCS deans list every semester.\n\nBut honestly, my advice is don't focus on GPA too much. CMU SCS is an extremely challenging curriculum and even finishing it is a feat by itself. Getting A is worth celebrating, getting B means you put in the work, getting C is not the end of the world and getting D or below might happen sometimes and it does not mean you are not worthy to be here as it happens to the best of us.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, unless you are trying to get into grad school, nobody cares about your GPA and you shouldn't be too anxious or scared about maintaining high GPA. It is great that you have goals and motivations but I think you should focus on exploring aspects of CS that intrigue you the most. It is very clique but I think it is important to focus on learning and have fun learning from some of the best minds in CS.",

I do not think a 4.0 is mentally healthy unless you otherwise find it all pretty easy.\n\nThe guy who graduated in last-place in my class still got work he liked doing, and that paid more than one might expect.  Most of the people who dropped out of my year still (eventually) got work they liked doing, and that paid more than one might expect.\n\nUnless you were trying to go for grad school in AI or Robotics, or go for a PhD in anything CS, GPA functionally doesn't matter all that much.  For \"I want to go work in industry\", internships (or on-campus research/lab work) seem to be at least as good to have.\n\n(Or, that was certainly what pulled up the guy in last place, and also everyone who didn't make the degree who still do work in industry.)",

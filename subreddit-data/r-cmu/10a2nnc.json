            "comment": "So, I had her for concepts (21-127) last semester and honestly I didn\u2019t think she was that bad of a lecturer. Yes, she goes kinda fast and she\u2019s kinda strict but I\u2019d say the only reason people didn\u2019t do to well in that class were because of the tests (which again hindsight, weren\u2019t even too bad if you studied). Also quite a funny professor in my class but I digress.\n\nIn terms of her for 21-256, I\u2019ve heard she makes it a LOT easier and less of a time crunch than for concepts. My friend took both concepts and multivariate with her last semester and said it was so much easier. \n\nI have no idea about the other person. Hope this helped!",

Never actually went to OH but he's definitely very approachable and cares a lot. Never had Irina as a prof but I've TAed for her before and it was horrible to say the least, and given what she says about students behind their backs I can only imagine what it's like to try to do well in her class...",

            "comment": "Irina is dope, just show a genuine interest in the class (i.e. go to her OH, go to recitation, go to other TA's OH so that they have something to say about you, etc.) and she'll help you how she can (from personal experience).  She tends to make it so that if you put in enough work and study enough then you should be able to easily get a B but to get an A you just have to have that mathematical creative edge on other people (which is a bit unfair since obviously not everyone has that ability).    \n\n\nEveryone makes her out to be a bitch, but after getting to know her she just has a prejudice that people just want the grade (and from personal experience that tends to be a lot of people here) and not the want to really learn the material (this is all speculative, she hasn't said this it's just from what I have observed).  So that's why I make the point to show a genuine interest in the class, don't show up to OH without having gone over the material or at least attempting the problem.   \n\n\nI may get shat on for having this opinion of her but I couldn't give much of a fuck lol \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck!",

There was a strong attempt to water down the math which made it less transferable than another professors would have been. (Reduction of logic to formulas as much as possible. Somewhat antithetical to cmu\u2019s focus on this regard)",

I would really appreciate it and could compensate for your time with CMU style hourly-rates (or come take pictures of you at your graduation event in exchange). \n\nYou don't have to be a professional. If you're available for one hour on the 12th (preferable 2:30 - 3:30 pm but otherwise any time should work) pls dm me :)",

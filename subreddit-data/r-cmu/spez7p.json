I was told the unused meal blocks are \"*reinvested*\" back into dining services, and selling meal blocks would **reduce** \"*CMU assets*\", so that's that. \n\n  \nOur original plan, of course, was to have students sell their meal blocks online to us (*very seamlessly &amp; in bulk*). We would then connect the blocks to the vendors here and have them make the meals, which are delivered by a number of nonprofit organizations. The student gets their money, the third-party local restaurants here get their money, the needy get the support they need, and ***only*** CMU loses money, and I guess that's not okay.\n\n  \nOf course, all the work is probably for **waste** (*like your extra blocks*). We had agreements with nonprofits, the restaurants themselves, built the web app, set up most of the logistics, and had universal support among students, but faced a **block**er in the university. I assure you that we're the most disappointed in all of this. This is just another example of university staff bloat and sloth-like policy change. If I had a similar budget, I'm pretty confident I could singlehandedly make a 10x better dining experience. \n\n  \nOh, but your tuition costs increase by another +**4%** again! \n\n  \nThere is more I'd like to say, and I am frustrated, but   \n***TL;DR*** can't sell blocks in any scenario. Even a peer to peer student block selling web app wouldn't be allowed!\n\n  \nThis was originally for a class, so our team needs to come up with a new idea real quick. Maybe onlyfans for cmu students. The university would probably be okay with that.",

I honestly thought you got the greenlight before you marketed it, otherwise i would have said something.\n\nDining is pretty tight about the meal plan, in that they dont like letting people off the plan (even kosher orthodox kids) and they likely financially plan for that amount of blocks that are unspent. I know someone who managed to convince dining to allow kids to use their late night block on milkshakes, and that was a good \"compromise\".\n\nWith dining, the best way to get progress is to find compromise where there bottom line isnt really affected. For instance, instead of building a slippery slope list of categories of people that are exceptions to signing up for the plan (kosher orthodox), they try to add some at least starting point minimal number of options, like offering kosher sandwiches in entropy (dont know if this is still a thing).\n\nSo when it comes to those unused mealblocks. They want most of those unused blocks to stay unused. Financially thats just how their math works. So, find a compromise that allows marginally more blocks to be used, (milkshake idea loool).\n\nEdit: tuition has nothing to do with dining. All or most departments run separate and independent budgets. Senate finance did a paper on why the tuition keeps increasing you might be able to find.",

We were advised to build the product first and develop the agreements before we approached them. Yes, we knew they were pretty tight, but we thought if we showed enough initiative and student support (over 112 signups in the first day alone) that would be enough. At least this way, we can go out in a blaze.",

This is actually a cool project you could do or propose/work with senate. Sample students in a survey of how many blocks they use vs dont. What meal period do they use most vs less. \n\nAnd you can look at the cost analysis from the student side. But then also from dinings side, how much goes to their expenses? Is the sushi at nakama sold at cost? At a higher price mark than non-school competitors?\n\nOne example of reinvestment of dollars is the renovations. Skibo is now au-bon pan, that space was completely renovated and redone by dining dollars. And to bring in au bon pon is also a higher cost. The underground last i heard was getting a huge remodel too. And when i say remodel, i mean breaking walls remodel.\n\nYou can try to look and assess their financial obligations and plans. They have a huge 5 or 10 year plan. \n\nMaybe ask students if they prefer these types of renovations (which do help increase cmu's overall assets, ranking, ameneties, and helps attract students and more donations), or if finding more opportunities for block use for current students is more valued.\n\nOnce a month there should be dining meetings with pascal and vendors that you as a student are allowed to go to. DSAC! They used to be in... whats the dorm, not fairfax... it's a dorm slightly off campus. You can just walk into those meetings, but i recommend being good spirited!\n\nEdit\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/dining/news/2021/dsac.html\n\nThey should stil be having meetings, website just doesnt get updated very often.

It looks like they are distinct and different providers owned by the same big company. I dont know from a quick glance whether these groups are managed by different people (which i think they are), have different niches (not sure), and how much of their systems/frameworks overlap. \n\nKinda like how instagram and facebook are owned by meta, they still have their differences. But also there are probably contractual similarities or vendor connections that mean the switch was ineffective. \n\nSo i hear your point that this switch doesnt really count, and very well could just be a pr stunt. Nothing seems like it would tangibly change with this switch.",

There's a lot of walking around the class to a pulse, conducting while stepping rhythms, weird interactive games, things of that sort. It seems really odd at first but churns out some great results. CMU is one of few universities that offers courses in Dalcroze Eurhythmics, which is the full name in case you want search it up.",

    "postText": "Hey all, I was wondering anyone here would know if it's against the rules to paint part of the fence white (or some other visibly projectable color) and project an interactive canvas onto it?\n\nI'm writing a [small web app](https://fencear.io) that mimics reddit's r/place that can only be painted by CMU students and was curious if it would be possible to project the resulting canvas live onto the actual fence.\n\nThis probably won't look good during daylight anyways, but if it's against the commonly accepted fence rules altogether, I will probably look into an AR alternative...\n\nIf it is possible, I am also fielding interest for anyone who would like to paint the fence lol\n\nEDIT: to clarify: the entire fence would be painted, just a part of it would be painted a specific color to be projected on",

In fact it was hastily painted all white last semester to take it back from the CMU republicans. Good luck with the projector idea though. I would think you would need a decently powerful/large projector to make it visible.",

I think people are under the impression that you are repainting whenever a pixel or whatever gets updated.\n\nI\u2019d definitely paint a link to your app so people know what is going on and it doesn\u2019t look like you did it just to cover what was there before.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I'm a Junior (M) studying CS and Im gonna be interning in the Bay Area this summer from mid-May to early August. Ik I'm kinda late but I was wondering whether anyone here was still searching for a place and roommates to bring the absurd living costs down? Feel free to DM me if you are, I'd be happy to chat.\n\nAlso, I was wondering whether anyone with previous experience interning in the Bay could recommend any websites/fb groups/online forums/etc that I could use for the housing search? I'd really appreciate any help I can get!\n\nThanks a lot!!",

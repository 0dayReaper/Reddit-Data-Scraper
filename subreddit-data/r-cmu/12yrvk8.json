    "postText": "Hi, I was recently admitted to Tepper, but am debating between here and Cornell Nolan for Hotel Admin. I'd like to know how current students/alums feel about this program.\n\nWhat kind of internships are usually taken at Tepper? Are they usually in Pittsburgh?\n\nDo you think it\u2019s possible to break into the business/film/entertainment industry within Tepper considering their drama reputation? Have you seen it happen before?\n\nWhat\u2019s the worst thing about Tepper?\n\nWhat are the most common jobs/salaries you\u2019ve seen graduates have and is it mainly in Pittsburgh? Would you say they\u2019re happy with their jobs?\n\nWas it easy maintaining a high GPA along with ECS and social life?\n\nWas Tepper worth the investment? (Terms of job salary/job outcomes)\n\nIt's totally ok if you can't answer every question, thank you for your help!",

            "comment": "1. Internships are kinda taken anywhere, I\u2019ve personally seen a lot of NYC, though there are a decent number in Pittsburgh. It\u2019s more about which companies people get internships from, and there\u2019s a few top companies, which just depends on your interests. \n\n2. I know two people currently in tepper who are interested in film, and they seem to be doing well. If you\u2019re able to take some of the drama classes it might help, but I\u2019m not interested in that so I can\u2019t be extremely helpful here. \n\n3. Worst thing depends on what you value tbh. Tepper has a lower workload than most other majors, so that\u2019s nice. It\u2019s still not a walk in the park though, and it\u2019s more math heavy than many other business schools. We do get crap for being business students (mostly from CS/Engineering ppl), but it doesn\u2019t really matter bc we get more sleep and are happier in general so who cares. \n\n4. Most common job type is Analyst, but again this depends. Answer is similar to the first question. A lot of graduates work in NYC, fewer in Pittsburgh. The biggest areas are Finance and Consulting in my experience. Marketing is probably third. As I said, I\u2019ve seen a lot of business/investment banking/financial analysts, some at consulting firms and others at banks for the most part. The graduates I\u2019ve talked to seem to enjoy their job. \n\n5. I think so, most Tepper people I know are in clubs and have high GPAs, as long as you are willing to put effort into stuff and manage your time well. Social life is also not too difficult imo, but if you like partying you should probably join a sorority/frat. Tepper generally has the most social people compared to most other majors. \n\n6. Haven\u2019t graduated yet so can\u2019t say for sure, but I will say most seniors I know in tepper already have a job lined up, and most do by the fall/winter of their senior year. Tepper prepares you well for the professional world, and it\u2019s not hard to get a job after graduating as long as you had internships and put in effort. \n\nHope this was helpful. I enjoy it here, but not everyone does, and for Tepper it\u2019s really what you make of it.",

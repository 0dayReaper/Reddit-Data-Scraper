My major of interest is computer science, and from what I know it is very difficult to get into CMU for CS. I like to think I have a good chance but I genuinely don't know if I am fit for applying to the school in the first place. I don't want to be dillusional, so I'd truly appreciate if any CS major who has gotten in can PM me and let me know if they think I could make it. I am willing to share any specific or general information about myself if that helps with determining my fit for the college. Thank you!!!",

No one I've met at this school has left without having experienced some sort of a breakdown or a major struggle (not to say this isn't the case at any college but it is definitely exacerbated by the hustle culture here). Trust me when I say that you should just apply for the program you want and if you don't get in then chin up and move on. It's probably for the best and you might thank me someday when you're happy wherever you end up!",

I know most international students here who came in ECE or IS or StatML and tried to transfer to one of the others because they didn't think they could directly get into said program. Coming into Dietrich Econ or undeclared and then going to Tepper or IS is pretty common too. I came in as a business major (international student) and switched to IS after my freshman year but that was motivated more by a change in my interests. I think transferring within CIT has become much easier now too so you can come in as Civil/MechE and transfer to whichever other Engineering field you were more interested in. \n\nAs a disclaimer though I think there are some downsides to this approach and you may have to push your graduation back by a bit because you can't get into some classes reserved for students of that specific major. It's always best to just apply in as the major you intend on sticking with and 'hopefully' you don't fall out favour with it and decide to switch to something else",

Of course, CMU is a pretty small campus, and it's never taken me more than 15 minutes walking from end to end (not including Mellon or the HCI classrooms). Art/Design/Archie(?) friends really liked having their dorm on the Hill (Schlag, Henderson) because it was less of a walk to and from studio, especially their freshman year. I lived in E-Tower, and it was honestly a great time :3 I had most of my classes in Baker/Wean, so it was alright. Honestly, E-Tower is my top pick. Yeah, it doesn't have AC but you can fix that with a little fan (and the summer passes quick enough into fall... it shouldn't be an issue). I lived in a private bathroom this year, and I lucked out having suitemates that communicated really well about cleaning our shared spaces, but I know a LOT of girls who had messy suitemates. I think for your first year, you should have the communal bathroom! Less time cleaning, more funny meetings at 2AM with other people on your floor, and more chances to talk to and meet people!",

Their website says decisions will be sent by April 5th (today). It\u2019s rolling admission tho so I feel like I would have received an email a little before april 5th. Also, pennsylvania is 3 hours ahead of my time zone (california) and it\u2019s 11pm right now, meaning it\u2019s already the next day, april 6th, there. I\u2019m worried something might have happened with my application, like something got lost or corrupted idk to make them not receive it or part of it or something like that. you can prolly tell i\u2019m stressed and tired from how i\u2019m typing. Has anyone heard of someone getting their summer pre-college admission decision late? Did I screw up my application somehow? was I supposed to apply earlier before the international deadline since I will be flying in from california or was I right and it doesnt count? hhh thank you for any feedback you can offer, i\u2019ll gladly accept anything &lt;3",

Just wanted to ask a few questions though:\n\nIs it possible to skip / test out of multivariable calculus? I'm currently taking the course right now\n\nHow difficult does taking ECE with an additional major in Robotics sound? I know the admission process for getting said additional major is difficult, so do you think I should shoot my shot with it?",

I think it\u2019s pretty flexible: the highest required cs class is data structures, math requirements are lower than all the other computer-related majors on campus (AFAIK really just up to calculus is required). You pick a track and take classes related. I don\u2019t know the tracks off the top of my head but there\u2019s definitely a design related one. The program is 4 years long but with a lot of AP credit and good work ethic, it might be possible to graduate earlier. But it\u2019s really common for IS majors to take upper cs/cs related courses, like concepts/discrete math, computer systems, functional programming, etc. You really do have a lot of freedom though and the workload is totally up to you to decide\n\nEdit: check this page out, http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/dietrichcollegeofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/informationsystems/#curriculumtextcontainer",

And the fees is too expensive i mean i don't think i would be able to afford it . And btw if you have any contact with an international student (would be happy if it is Indian) in CMU who studies undergraduate in CMU . And also can I get some contacts of your friends who study major as information System . Just send an Instagram ID.  And thanks for the reply too \u263a\ufe0f\u2728",

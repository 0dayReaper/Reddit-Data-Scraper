The only difference in the school year is that 213 has live lectures / recitations and 513 has recorded ones, but I'm not sure about the summer. Otherwise, the courses are identical.\n\n18213 is the ECE dept.'s version of the course, which stopped being cross-listed a few years ago. The content might have diverged, but I think generally is quite similar to 15213/513.",

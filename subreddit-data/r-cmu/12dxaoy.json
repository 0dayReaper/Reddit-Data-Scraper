As with all things on the Internet, if you want exact info, post something that might be wrong and 23953 other people will show up to correct you. :-)\n\nThere is a small mess of hotels in and near CMU.  What's your budget like?  On the more expensive end is the Mansions on Fifth which are old mansions turned into a hotel.  More reasonable is the Hilton Garden and the Residence Inn which are both on Forbes Avenue, a few miles from the main campus. It's a short walk or a quick bus ride up to campus from either.  The further away from campus you get the cheaper the stay.\n\nAs for getting around without a car: Pittsburgh has a fairly robust bus system.  (Yes, yes, current people; it sucks compared to huge cities. Move on.) It has limits, especially on weekends, but it can get you around if you plan.  It is really bad at night, though.  The days of 24 hour bus routes is long gone.  The bus system is designed like a wheel with the center Downtown and most of the bus routes going outward like spokes. \n\n- There's a bus (28X) that goes between the airport and CMU\n\n- There's two series of buses that go from the area around CMU to Downtown (61s and 71s)\n\n- From Downtown you can catch a variety of buses to take you away in other directions.\n\n- There's a teeny 3 stop \"subway\" system Downtown, which is really part of the \"Light Rail\" (which old people still call \"trolley\") system that goes into the South Hills. (CMU is east of Downtown.)  \n\nDowntown does have some interesting things but there are the Carnegie Art &amp; Natural History museums and the Phipps Conservatory within skipping distance of CMU.   The science museum is near Downtown but across one of the rivers.  The sportsball places are also near but across rivers from Downtown.  \n\nIIRC the bus schedule and route information is all available online and in apps these days.  I'm sure others can explain that better than I can. \n\nHave fun in Pixxburgh!",

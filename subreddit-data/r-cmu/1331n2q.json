I know i want a semi sweet because i don\u2019t want to go through using communal bathrooms. I know it\u2019s a lottery system, but please tell me what your recommendations and why. I really need help!",

It also has a game room, a computer lab WITH PRINTERS, practice rooms with keyboards, communal kitchens every other floor, a gym, and The Underground downstairs so there\u2019s easy access to food for if you\u2019re lazy or when it\u2019s raining/snowing! Also, it\u2019s right at the intersection of Forbes and Morewood for easy access to the buses (including the 28X for if you have suitcases!). Could not recommend it more :)",

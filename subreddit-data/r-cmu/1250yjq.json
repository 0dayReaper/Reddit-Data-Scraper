Yours might already be answered!\n\nPlease consider posting to subs like /r/pittsburgh for general life in Pittsburgh questions, dedicated subs like /r/chanceme, /r/ApplyingToCollege, and /r/collegeresults for odds of getting accepted, and using the search in the sidebar.\n\n^(If I've misidentified your post, please ignore this message and instead take it as a reminder to contribute your own answers to the megathread.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I started out in H&amp;SS and finished in MCS.  IS is a really good degree and all the kids I graduated with are doing amazing.  SCS is more difficult to transfer to.  In a lot of ways CMU is not a good place to be of you don\u2019t know your path.  Over a decade later I\u2019m still figuring it out, and some important things about the University have changed in the years since.  What would you do in MCS?",

    "postText": "currently enrolled in the earliest 213 section (9 am) because that was the only one without a waitlist when i was registering. i just looked at the waitlists for the other sections now and they all have 4-5 people on them. i hate waking up early and would prefer to have a later lab time. should i switch sections and put myself on one of the waitlists for a later lab time or is that a bad idea? im just not sure if 213 is one of those classes where people usually end up getting off the waitlist within a couple days of the semester starting. i can suck it up and stay with the 9 am if it\u2019s the only way i can take the class, but would really prefer not to if there\u2019s another option.",

            "comment": "Scs core courses are always insanely good at clearing people off the waitlist, but most of those sections\u2019s sizes are fixed by the room capacity. Odds are additional sections will be made and waitlisted students will be invited to register (has happened to me for multiple classes). \n\nSo the odds are that of 4-5 of 20-30 people drop (in which case someone might need to confirm but you might be able to switch sections during the semester), or that the new sections are at a better time (decently likely). \n\nHaving taken it during the summer I can\u2019t speak to the ease of attending other recitations (ex. very easy for 210 and not for 251), but the third option is waiting. Since the waitlist isn\u2019t going to increase it is possible to wait for the new sections to be created or maybe drops. Def know the pain of early classes and the choice seems to be a function of expected drop rates, do gl and I think that is all the other applicable info.\n\n(Realize you probably know most of this just leaving an info dump in case anyone else comes with a similar question)",

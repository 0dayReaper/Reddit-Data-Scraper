The prevailing winds actually run northeast, which is why our rain comes in bursts, not constantly like Seattle which is always directly downwind of the ocean. All the hills around here push the air higher, making the water condense.",

Pittsburgh has a lot of days where there's 30 second of rain but it counts as a rain day.\nAccording to this website Pittsburgh and Seattle get the same amount of rain each year, and much less rain than Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Miami, Orlando, DC. https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/US/average-annual-precipitation-by-city.php",

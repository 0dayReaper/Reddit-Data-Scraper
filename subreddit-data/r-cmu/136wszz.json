Since it's all-girls now, does anyone who lives there have any thoughts on how it is? (room size, bathrooms, other facilities, pros/cons, etc). What other good dorms at CMU are there?",

Everyone who lived there ranked it last on their housing form but ended up bonding over the shared misery. \n\nI can\u2019t speak to how it is currently, but assuming the room sizes and bathrooms are relatively the same, the facilities are a lot smaller than other dorms on campus (stever, mudge, Morewood etc.) I think a big Pro is that since it\u2019s a small community, it\u2019s easy to make new friends and get close with your floor but this isn\u2019t to say that you can\u2019t do this in other dorms.",

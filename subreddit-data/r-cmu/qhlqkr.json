    "postText": "EDIT: PROFESSOR HOWIE CHOSET is the candidate\n\nI was just in the gym and this professor started harassing this student... Student was using the machine just normally and professor told them how many sets they had left. The student said they had like 3 sets left and the professor started harassing them telling them to go do the sets and not use their phone while resting. The student was not even resting for that long jesus christ. Then the professor harassed them even more and told them to not use their phones during rest and proceed to do the set. He asked for their name and said \"I hope to see you on campus soon\". Like wtf. The professor was of small height and very skinny. I confronted him and told him to chill and respect the student and he told me to \"mind my own business\". How about he minds his own business?\n\nIf anyone was in the UC Gym between 6:30 and 7:30 AM and knows the name of the professor I would appreciate it. I hope we dont have professors like this in our campus! I dont pay 75K for this nonsense",

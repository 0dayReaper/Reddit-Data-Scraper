    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm a CS student at WashU\n\nThis summer I'm interning with a startup  that's democratizing entrepreneurship \u2014 we're building a platform for like-minded programmers, designers, &amp; founders to build, distribute resources, and collaborate. **The mission is making the competitive advantages of places like MIT and Harvard significantly more obsolete.**\n\nI'm reaching out because we need a few pilot users from Carnegie Mellon to give our Collegiate Community a test run. If goals are met, we'll acquire 1M users by the end of the year. Pre-scale, we need to test the efficacy of our college network. This entails UX, resources, &amp; support making entrepreneurship a realistic, viable career option, as well as a network of founders, designers, and programmers. \n\nIf you're interested,  leave a comment on this post, or dm this account, and I'll shoot out an invite link so you can see everything for yourself.\n\nThanks!",

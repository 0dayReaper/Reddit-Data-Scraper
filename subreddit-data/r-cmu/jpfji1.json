    "postText": "To Our Esteemed University President:\n\nThank you for your recent emails surrounding our electoral process. They strike a remarkably conciliatory tone during a truly trying time for our students and our community.\n\nI follow your social media and have always read your emails in full and with great interest. I believe you are a man who values the democratic process and who truly treasures the founding ideals of the institutions of our country and our academic community. You take pride in the noble act of the vote. You cherish it.\n\nAs such, I cannot help but find it extraordinary that you found in favor of Richard Grenell's appointment. One of the key arguments you used to justify your decision earlier this term was that as an individual coming from outside the realm of academia, his previous behavior should not be beholden to the same rigorous ethical standards upon which we insist for current members of our community. I will note that while this argument did not convince me, and certainly did not convince the community whose moral integrity you are to oversee, I did accept your decision. Mr. Grenell had, after all, not committed any breaches of conduct while in association with the university, and I trusted your decision to be judicious. It was not my place to disagree.\n\nNow it is. Since the first discussion surrounding Grenell's appointment, he has promulgated hateful speech to his hundreds of thousands of followers; has participated in the spread of malicious and willful disinformation campaigns that erode the integrity of the voting process, the central pillar of our democratic society, for naked political benefit; has repeatedly and openly flouted CMU's Covid-19 prevention measures on national television; and now has attempted outright intimidation of poll workers in Nevada in a dangerous and unprecedented attempt to prevent the American electorate from having its voice heard.\n\nLet me speak in no uncertain terms: **this man makes a mockery of our academic community's ethical, health, and cultural norms and has proven himself incapable of being restricted by any standard of decency**.\n\nWere a student or another staff member to behave in the way he has, they would have long been disciplined or ejected from our community. The fact that he can continue in this fashion without repercussion showcases fear on the part of CMU's administration. Fear of PR backlash. Fear of losing donor funds. Fear of being called political during a time of division.\n\nAnd in succumbing to those fears, CMU has not only diminished its standing in the eyes of its students, it has concluded that the short-term benefits of political expediency matter more than upholding the values by which we claim to live. It has demonstrated that its rules are only applicable to those without the political or economic power to pressure our leaders into folding in *cowardice*. It has shown that hypocrisy and division are more powerful than honesty and unity.\n\nI am not a political radical. I do not criticize the political leanings of the recent appointee. I am incensed, rather, by his attacks on our sacrosanct democratic institutions. I am outraged by his vitriolic, racist, hateful speech so to the detriment of the culture of collaboration and unity we have attempted to foster at our beloved university. I stand unbelieving of the cowardice that CMU has displayed in dealing with all of the above issues.\n\nAnd I am disappointed. I am disappointed in you, President Jahanian. Disappointed that the person whom I admired and whom I truly believed cared about this fragile and cherished thing we call democracy, whom I trusted in upholding our culture of integrity and inclusivity, can look the other way when a member of our staff displays such egregious and destructive behavior.\n\nIf your emails are not merely words, and your old beloved photos of your first time participating of our democratic experiment are not merely political theatre -- I beseech you, please, right this wrong. \n\nBest Regards,\n\nA CMU Student",

Students should not be asked to behave more responsibly than staff or faculty.\n\nI can't imagine encouraging someone to go to a school that carves out space for someone that happily attacks public health and our very basis for governance -- and is supported by CMU money and credentialing to do so.",

I suspect they'd have to either bend over backwards specifically for Grenell, or set things up where his appointment would be \\*very\\* unlikely to be renewed.\n\nBut just tossing him out doesn't help; set the framework so it's more clear, so we don't have to do this again.  In the meanwhile, for the alums out there, stop feeding them until they build guidelines so we can judge where this one would fall.",

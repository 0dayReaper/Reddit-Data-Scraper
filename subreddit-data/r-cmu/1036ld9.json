    "postText": "Hello everybody. I submitted my RD application to CMU last night, and after going through my submitted supplementals, I noticed that one *may be* a bit hard to understand. The entire thing is written as a traditional narrative poem, which is why I feel it may be hard to understand. So far, everyone who's read it knows me, so it doesn't really emulate what it will be like when an AO reads it; which is why I want someone who doesn't know me to read it and tell me whether I'm fine or I'm f\\*cked. Is there anybody willing to do so?\n\nThanks a lot!",

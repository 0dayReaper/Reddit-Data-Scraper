    "postText": "Hi guys! I'm an admitted student to Dietrich (Humanities + Social Sciences college), and I'm hoping to go pre-med. I've done a lot of research into the Health Professions Program, but I think it would be great to hear from students who are actually pre-med at CMU to get a sense of their experiences. Of course, if someone knows pre-med students and their experiences, they can answer too.\n\n\\- What is your major? (particularly interested in Dietrich students for this question, but others can answer as well) \n\n\\- How easy is it to find clinical experience, research, jobs, physician shadowing experience etc.? (I'm also considering Northeastern University bc of their co-op program, but if there are similar work/volunteering experiences in hospitals in Pittsburgh that would be great)\n\n\\- How helpful would you say the Health Professions Program office is in helping you in pre-med? (Do they offer help in your med school applications? Are they active in helping you find opportunities to shadow doctors, work/volunteer at hospitals, and/or find research/internships? etc.)\n\n\\- What kinds of experiences in hospitals have you guys had? What types of research and/or internships have you done?\n\n\\- What makes CMU better for pre-med than other schools? (please, it would be great to get answers about this from someone who is actually in pre-med at CMU!)\n\n\\- Would you say the general required pre-med courses at CMU are super hard? (ex. bio, chem, etc.) Additionally, does CMU have all of the required courses for pre-med, or do you have to take courses elsewhere?\n\n\\- Any recommendations in terms of balancing academics with hospital work / research and student life?\n\nThanks so much guys!!",

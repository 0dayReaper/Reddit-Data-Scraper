    "postText": "I'm a junior at high school in the U.S. I'm a permanent resident here. I'm considering CMU-Q for undergrad because of its small student body size and teachers also know almost all the students by name (according to other posts about cmuq). I really like its tight-knit community. Plus, there are more scholarships and financial aid opportunities there. I wanna major in business administration or/and cs there. I also want to gain experience in the industry along the way through internships. My questions are\n- How is the internship process at cmuq? Do companies recruit international students there? \n- Also, is it possible to get a summer internship in the U.S while studying at cmuq? because I'll come back to the states every summer anyway,  so might as well do something beneficial here. \n- does the business administration and cs programs prepare you for the industry?\n- do business administration/cs students who graduate from the main campus have better chances to get a job compared to those who graduate from CMU-Q?\n- how is the dorm life there? I used to study in a boarding school before and the design of cmuq dorms remind me of those times, that's why i'm a bit biased towards cmuq\n-how's overall lifestyle for college students there? Food? Safety? Transportation? Entertainment?\n\nAny other related information is also much appreciated :) and let me know if i need to clarify anything thank you!\n\nEdit: how much does the living cost for a month for students?",

            "comment": "CMU-Qatar is far from a scam.  I don't have any personal experiences with CMU-Australia, but what you are describing of your experience there very much doesn't describe CMU-Q.  It has a beautiful campus, the quality of education is very high, and students go on to find good jobs and grad school opportunities, including in the US.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, I'll try your questions:\n\n1. Employment recruitment in general (not just internship recruitment) is not nearly as good at CMU-Q as at the main campus.  Frankly, it sucks.  Don't expect to get recruited to an US based position from CMU-Q.  There aren't enough students for companies to invest the time and money for a visit to CMU-Q.\n2. I have seen students get summer internships in the US.  They were all US citizens or green card holders.  The biggest hindrance for students to find US internships tends to be right-to-work, not \"is your campus really CMU\".  US employers don't want to sponsor a visa to bring in an intern.  If you have a US green card, then you can apply for US based internships and be competitive because you can legally work in the US.\n3. The BA and CS programs at CMU-Q run the same curriculum as in Pittsburgh.  Both programs have high job placement rates.  Whether they \"prepare you for industry\" (or whether they should) is somewhat subjective.\n4. I think that main campus students do have a better chance at US based employment after graduation.  See notes 1 and 2 above.  However, if you have a green card, then 2 isn't an issue for you.\n5. From what I hear, dorm life is luxurious but lonely.  Most students at CMU-Q already live in Qatar, and so do not live in the dorms.  There is no \"campus vibe\" at Education City.  Students do not get the \"College Experience\".\n\nIf you were to get an admissions offer from both campuses, and the financial situation was the same, then I would pick Pittsburgh.  However, the financial aid at the Qatar campus is much better for students who have financial need.  Under the current model, admitted students do something similar to the FAFSA, and the Qatar Foundation meets all need with grants.  For people from less financially advantageous backgrounds, this is huge.\n\nI hope these thoughts are helpful.",

                    "comment": "As someone who just came back from my semester abroad at CMU-P, point 5 could not be more wrong. If the campus vibe you are looking for is a bunch of cliques where you might feel too intimidated to make a move to socialize, then I guess your point holds, but other than that I find the atmosphere at CMU-Q much friendlier.  \n\n\nI also think that point 3 generally does not transfer well for BA from what I have heard from my friends in Business. The CS curriculum at CMU-Q is just as rigorous though, and the only difference is the variety of courses that studying in Pittsburgh.",

            "comment": "As a CMUQ student, here are my opinions:\n\n1. I don't think there is any company would not appreciate the prestige of CMU. It sounds a bit cheating, but you are a part of CMU anyway.\n2. You are free to do whatever you want in summer. So there is nothing hindering from doing an internship in the US. Getting an offer is more important.\n3. CMUQ strictly follows the curriculum of CMUP. Do you think the curriculum of CMUP prepare for industry?\n4. In the end of the day, you get a CMU degree. IMO it is more or less a fair game if you ignore advantages like OPT.\n5. You will have to get used to the Arabic (and Indian) cuisine. There are lots of free food in campus. As you live in the Muslim world, alcohol is prohibited, but there are clubs that you can go to for drinks. There is metro for you to travel around Doha. I think for entertainment Doha is pretty much the same as other cities around the world. Overall, imo, how your \"college experience\" is depends largely on you. If you want to hang out, you will eventually find your friends. You can talk with ppl not only from CMUQ but also students from other EC unis. The NUQ guys always have parties.\n\nIf you are considering CMUQ, the CS program is quite good. CS courses are quite the same as Pittsburgh, although limited in quantity. IMO, the BA program in Qatar is not as good as in Pittsburgh for reasons.",

            "comment": "Cmu Q is a scam. Cmu has a lot of satellite campuses that are just for making money from clueless international students.\n\nI went to Cmu Australia - it was complete horseshit. No campus, quality of teachers is worse than a community college, no future job opportunities for students. CMU Australia then shut down (because everyone realized it's a scam).\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Qatar shuts down too. Don't waste your money and time - stay in the US",

                    "comment": "Although I do not have first-hand experience with CMU-Q, in my opinion CMU-Q is the most \"legit\" of the satellite campuses. It shows in the degree to which CMU-Pittsburgh interacts with CMU-Q relative to the other satellites (some of our faculty are from CMU-Q, they're invited to some of our meetings, etc)\n\nI would not extrapolate experiences from CMU-SV / CMU-Australia / CMU-wherever to CMU-Q.\n\nThat said, I'm not in a position to answer OP's question, though I suspect your advice of \"stay in the US\" is good in general.",

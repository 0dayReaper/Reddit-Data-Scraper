    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming master student currently thinking about commuting options. I know that CMU has shuttles and buses, but I do have a car, so I was wondering how difficult it is for a student to get a parking permit. I saw the parking portal that it is not on waitlist for 22-23 school year. Does anyone know when will the next school year's permit be available?",

East Campus Garage is free in the evening (and weekends, I think) so it's not unusual for students to get their cars around dinner time and then drive back to campus if they're working late.",

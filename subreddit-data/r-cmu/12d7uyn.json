    "postText": "Hello,\n\nA little bit about myself:\n\n* I am an undergraduate at Georgia Tech, majoring in CS. \n* I am graduating this spring and I am having trouble deciding between GT and CMU. \n* I am interested in Data Science and ML. \n* I got accepted into the Carnegie Mellon's Master of Information Systems Management with Concentration in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (MISM-BIDA).\n\nI have been looking into reviews for MISM-BIDA and there wasn't much online. I know that CMU is known for their SCS, but I wanted to ask for people's opinion on Heinz and whether it is worth moving to CMU to go to a \"less well-known\" school. I heard that you could take electives from SCS, but I am uncertain as to whether it is worth the extra tuition to move schools for a more \"brand\" name school.\n\nI am also skeptical that the coursework will not prepare me for the ML aspect to take on my wanted career path. The degree is also neither a MSCS or MBA degree.\n\nI would appreciate any comments/insight/experience from people in the CMU program as I believe I am already pretty knowledgeable of the GT MSCS program.\n\nThank you in advance!",

You will be restricted doing Heinz degrees while trying to do SCS courses, and you'll have additional requirements which you might not want to take. \n\nIf you want a graduate degree in CS, then an MSCS is obviously the better choice. \n\nA CS degree is far more valuable imo, in a general sense.\nAnd GTech will be MUCH cheaper.",

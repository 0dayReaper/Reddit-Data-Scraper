    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have received admits from CMU MIIS and UCLA MS CS. I have been doing research for 2 years in my undergraduate studies. I am keen on doing research, and would ideally love to pursue a PhD. I believe that CMU has exceptional NLP professors, but MIIS would be too hectic and limited to NLP, whereas UCLA will give me the freedom (both in terms of time and choice of study) to pursue research. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat would you recommend?",

I would like to become a business leader in tech oriented company( mobile application product ) with a solid UIUX start being product designer or something like that. With those plans, should I choose IYA in USC or design in CMU. I will minor in Human Computer Interaction if I decide to go to CMU. I grow up in Bay Area. It could be beneficial for me to go to eastern coast for a few years.",

            "comment": "The connections and opportunities you\u2019ll get at CMU will put you on track for those plans, 100%. Design x HCI is a very desirable combo if you want to get into product design in tech. \n\nAlso it\u2019s great to live out of state for a bit. LA will have a better social scene, weather and food\u2026 if that\u2019s important for you. I grew up in the Bay Area as well and I think my time in Pittsburgh really pushed me to become self-reliant and resilient. You\u2019ll find a lot of other Bay Area transplants too, so it won\u2019t feel too alien. Coming back home for winter and summer breaks made me appreciate bay area so much more; I came back pretty happily after grad, and scratched that \u201citch\u201d of wanting to live somewhere else. Also, it\u2019s easy to travel to bigger cities like NYC, Chicago, etc and to Europe during school breaks as well. GL w your decision!",

We get these comparative questions a lot here and I always caution that few if any people attended undergrad at both institutions so consider what you're asking. I doubt you could go wrong either way.",

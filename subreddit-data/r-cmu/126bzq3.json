    "postText": "Hi.. I have been admitted to MISM-12 general pathway starting May 2023 but I am still trying to arrange the funds to show for I-20 and have paid the enrolment deposit of $1500. I am really worried that I will be able to arrange the huge amount of fund for I-20 due to delay in the process from lenders. So I was thinking to ask for deferral to the next available session for the same pathway. Wanted to understand the probability and possibility for my request to get accommodated at CMU. Only one month is left and I have a lot to manage with finance, visa , accommodation and travel . I am feeling overwhelmed with all the pending items till this point and hence willing to ask for deferral. Please suggest if anyone has done that before.",

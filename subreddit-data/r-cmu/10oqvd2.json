    "postText": "Just registered for this semester's tartan hack, but right now I am already bombarded with my course works, club activities, and intern application. I would say my main motivation for tartanhack because I heard doing some hackathons might help with your resume. But now I know my teammates might not spend a lot of time on the hackathon, and I also have assignments due soon. So getting a solid hackathon project done to put on a resume might be low...  \nNeed some suggestions. Does it still worth the chance? or maybe I should spend more of my time prepping for the application, portfolio, and interview.",

    "postText": "Taking 21-240 next semester with Michaeli. I don't expect the class to be a breeze but how manageable is the workload? How is Michaeli as a professor?\n\nAlso, I've heard mixed opinions about how proof-heavy the class is. Are there a lot of proofs cuz I really hate those : (",

There\u2019s a homework every week but it shouldn\u2019t take more than 2-4 hours. \n\nI really liked Michaeli and I think he explains the intuition really well. There were some proofs on homeworks and more basic ones on exams but they definitely weren\u2019t a big focus of the class.",

            "comment": "I just took it this semester with Prof. Mohammad Nezhad. The pace of the course is really fast, so make sure to read the lecture notes so you have a good grasp of the material. Go to recitations as well, although they may seem useless at first they do wonders for review and give you a chance to ask questions. Also, do the homework as early as possible, because depending on the problem set you might end up spending twice as much time as you usually would. If you do all that, the course should definitely be manageable! There are not really any proofs in this course. While you will see them in the lectures, you will very rarely be asked about them in the homework.",

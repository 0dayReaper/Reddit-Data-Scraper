    "postText": "Hello, I am a current senior applying to CMU. I just finished my first semester of my senior year which means my mid year grades are being sent out. I got an 82 average in AB calc an 83 last quarter and 80 this quarter. I was wondering if having a B in AP Calc would have a big negative impact on my chances in getting in. Having a small \"panic\" attack. I know that this grade does not reflect how well I can do because I know I can do better. I just didn't put in the work to be honest anyway. anyway from what you know, will it have a big negative impact on my chances? I applied for Computer Engineering ",

Most (but not all) CMU students in those majors breezed through AP calc BC in high school. But like others said, no one outside admissions has any way of knowing. As a second semester senior, you've pretty much done what you can for college at this point.",

Getting deferred isn't anything like being \"halfway in.\" Most students who get deferred will be rejected.\n\nIf you had gotten in, they would just want to make sure you're not \"lazing off.\" They deferred you because your application wasn't strong enough at the time you applied. This new B in AB Calc isn't going to help things.",

I'm CE and I certainly didn't breeze through AB calc.\n\n  \nObviously, it's not ideal to have lower grades in highschool, but in the big picture it doesn't matter. Do you feel like you put together a good portfolio for CMU/good common app?\n\nBest of luck and hopefully you get in",

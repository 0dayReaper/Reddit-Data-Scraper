Though if you\u2019re worried it can\u2019t hurt take a skim through the first few weeks online so you can land on your feet.",

I was concerned about getting an a in the course so I dropped to 110. I was not prepared for the different way of thinking that 112 makes you do. \n\nI did the winter break prep and felt a little better about it. I wish I had taken 112 with more coding experience. I dropped to 110 after 3 weeks of 112 and found that 110 was better paced and a lot easier to do.",

But if you want to, you can look at previous semesters of 112 and go through notes and use the quizzes to study the material. \n\n[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/\\~112-n22/schedule.html](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112-n22/schedule.html) this is the link for last summer. If you go into the syllabus tab, you can find links to past semesters. These are good if you want to have multiple different practice quizzes to learn the content. Good luck!",

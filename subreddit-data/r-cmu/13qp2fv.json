    "postText": "I am an incoming-freshman and I am going to be studying at the college of Engineering. I am unsure where my classes are (since Calculus, Chemistry and 15112 seems like basically GenEd for everyone) (I can\u2019t even pick my schedule yet so\u2026 I just made an estimate based on what was opened on SIO). \n\n1. Is it normal that all I can see on SIO for Modern Chemistry have only night sessions / weekend sessions ( I mean the ABC not 123 part of choices)? Since if I really have to walk around the campus at night, I would have to choose a dormitory that is closer to the class. \n\n2. Which of the dorms are closest to Engineering (especially Chemical Engineering and Material Science but does the first year curriculum have anything to do with the location of the department?) (I tried Google mapping and the results weren\u2019t so satisfactory. It seems like everything is 10-15 minutes so it really doesn\u2019t matter that much?)\n\n3. Semi-Suite Bathrooms v.s. Traditional \n\nI've never been in a boarding house except for summer camp, so I don't know much about the bathroom setup.\nSemi-suite is supposed to be 5-6 people sharing a bathroom but the person who lives there cleans up after themselves during the semester?\nTraditional is a whole floor with shared bathrooms and toilets but with professional staff to clean them? (Is the number of bathrooms on the floor plan true? Because according to my poor counting, there are only 3 bathrooms for 27 people on one floor of Scobell?)\n\nI am an International Student so I won\u2019t be able to be on campus until Move-In day. Therefore it would be great help if anyone can give any recommendations/advice/experiences on dorms/classes. \n\nP.S. I want to live with AC. I prefer not to climb more than three flights of stairs every day to get to my room, so either the building has an elevator or it is no more than three stories high. That wipes out Morewood Garden and E-Tower.",

            "comment": "Hi, I lived in Scobell this year, and yes, there were 3 bathrooms per floor. Honestly it wasn't really a problem - people are in and out of the building at different times and I never had an issue with needing the bathroom and not being able to use it. NB Scobell is also all female.\n\nThere isn't a specific engineering building, nor will all of your classes be there. Distance-wise it doesn't really matter whether you pick The Hill or Morewood corridor, the only places substantially further away are Rez and Clyde.\n\nE-tower has an elevator, so does Stever. I don't think any other dorm does but they're all 3 floors max. However the dorms on The Hill are on, well, a hill, so living on the 3rd floor of Scobell for me meant like 5-6 flights of stairs to get to my room. Based on this you should consider E-tower, Gardens, and Stever, except you're not guaranteed AC anywhere except I think Stever.\n\nAs for bathrooms, if you have a semi-suite, you share the  bathroom with your roommate(s) and the room attached to yours. So if you live in a double attached to a double it's 4 people sharing that bathroom. You 4 are in charge of cleaning it the whole semester. If you live in a traditional dorm (like Scobell) the bathrooms are cleaned by staff at least once a week.\n\nHopefully this helps!",

There is a specific elevator that you can't use during certain hours because they are for the mental health office in E-tower, but the other elevators are fine. All my friends in E-tower have been using them all year and so have I when I go in there. It would be absurd to make you climb 7 flights of stairs.",

            "comment": "chem only has night recitations, so that is normal on sio.\n\npersonally, i would significantly lower your expectations for bathroom ratios, building height, and even AC, given the dorm selection process is a lottery. trust me, you will get used to all this and your dorm life is only a very small portion of your college experience. plus, if you really don't have ac, you can often find a quiet and well-cooled place to hang out/study on campus. the dorms are more social than anything, and personally, i would prioritize location over amenities unless you have a medical/other reason not to, since you want to be out of your room at college.\n\nin terms of location, they are all a reasonable walk to doherty/hammerschlag, with the hill being a little farther (but traffic light free) walk than morewood. i would also get used to bringing a charger around.  \n\npersonally, i lived in west wing, where we were responsible for cleaning our bathrooms. not a big deal, since the suite can divide and conquer to clean. clorox wipes are pretty effective with that.",

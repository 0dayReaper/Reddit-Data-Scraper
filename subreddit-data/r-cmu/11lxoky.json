On-campus jobs are hourly wages, so depending on the number of hours, you should be able to earn decently. Getting a paid RA position isn\u2019t impossible, and if you do, they pay decent a amount.  It depends on the professor\u2019s funding tbh. You can start by checking out the professors in your department whose research interests you and send them an email with your resume and ask them if they\u2019re hiring any students for paid positions. You can contact any professor on campus, doesn\u2019t need to necessarily be in your department.",

            "comment": "You're undeclared in your first year unless you're an IS major. So you can declare anything from philosophy to statistics with no issue - you don't have to \"transfer.\" After you've declared (you have until mid-sophomore year to do this) it's also not too difficult to switch within Dietrich! Just talk to your advisor and you'll probably have to ensure you take certain classes/fulfil certain requirements and then you can declare a different major.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote that EconMath requires you to have a 3.5 GPA to declare and a 3.0 to graduate. I'm not aware of any other Dietrich major with requirements this harsh but these might come in the way of you switching.",

            "comment": "Not hard - in fact it's encouraged for Dietrich first years to shop around, and they can't declare until Spring.\n\nOne thing worth noting about Econ - if you do decide to declare Econ (which you would do in the Spring), the new policy (I'm 90% sure) is that they'll ask you to choose between being in Dietrich and Tepper. I believe the only tangible differences are the gen ed requirements and the fact that it'd be harder to switch back out of Econ to a different Dietrich major (but only if you had actually declared Econ first).\n\nYou should also look into the Econ and Public Policy major - it might combine all of your interests into one",

    "postText": "Joining as an employee (technical staff) soon.  I was told that one of the benefits was the option to take two classes a semester at the university.  One of my colleagues on my new team is currently pursuing a PhD and another completed an MBA from CMU.\n\nI was wondering if any current employees had any insight into how to navigate admissions process.  It is a little bit daunting to apply to programs that boast a very low acceptance rate.\n\nI currently hold an MEng, and am hoping to pursue a PhD, however my masters GPA is somewhat lackluster, but I do have quite a bit of research experience and professors that attended CMU.  \nWould pursuing additional classes (or perhaps a second masters) at CMU to boost graduate GPA and possibly publishing more research help boost my application?  Does outputting work with CMU (and possibly collaborating with that department) make for a more favorable application?",

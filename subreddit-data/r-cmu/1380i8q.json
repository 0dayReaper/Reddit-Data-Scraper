    "postText": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI was wondering, if I was planning on graduating with the degree (MS CS) in the timeframe of two years, could I work part time possibly? Trying to see if I need to take out loans. If anyone that has done a MS at CMU and worked part time, how was it and how did you manage it?  I worked part time as an undergraduate, so just trying to gauge what I'd be getting myself into.",

            "comment": "I also worked part time as an undergraduate in a range of on-campus desk jobs. When I first got here, I used to believe something like, \"it would be a waste to not earn an extra 800/month\" (that's multiples of my previous salary!). In Pittsburgh, either number can cover your a significant fraction of your monthly living expenses (or all of it, if you're thrifty).\n\nBut what's the maximum amount that you can earn as a part-time student? It's probably 10-15k a year here for on-campus roles. For the typical range of companies that our BSCS and MSCS students go to, there can be more than a 50k difference in just your signing bonus alone. Now add in the effect of a higher starting salary over the course of your working life. Assuming that you can weather the cost of living, it starts to make quite a bit of financial sense to focus on optimizing for your first job after graduation, imo.\n\nYou might want to consider TAing as a resume-worthy alternative to working part time, though you typically cannot TA in your first semester. In CS, I believe this currently pays 17/hr for MS students, with a (strict if you're international) maximum of 20 hours a week. It also has the benefit of being more flexible with respect to workload management, since you can usually distribute the load across the deadlines of multiple TAs.",

The biggest thing I\u2019m worried about is the stress for the courses. I pretty decent with time management, can sit down and go to office hours as need b, but also want to not have so much debt for keeping a roof over my head.",

A lot of your ugrad classmates have neither. n=1, but I know a masters student who worked part-time as a SWE and he was fine (in fact, he was doing research on top of that).\n\nI see some ROTC stuff in your post history; from observing other students, I feel that whatever discipline you get from army life carries over well to CMU study habits. IMO, you'll be fine. But good luck either way!",

I was planning on continuing my research at CMU as well since I've been with the group for over a year and a half now, really like the environment.  If he could do it, so could I then!",

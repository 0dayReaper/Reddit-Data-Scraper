    "postText": "Richard Grenell is not fundamentally qualified to remain on the Carnegie Mellon campus.  I am all for free speech and hearing from all sides of a policy or political argument, but Grenell's behavior related to the presidential election outcome is a danger to democracy, a danger to the United States of America, and pure intellectual dishonesty.  The first two issues might be forgivable, but intellectual dishonesty to the point where he will not even provide his name to back his statements is disqualifying in an academic environment of higher learning and a blemish on the reputation of Carnegie Mellon.   \nPolitico: \"In Nevada, Ric Grenell, an RNC official and former ambassador to  Germany, accused state election officials of covering up voter fraud.  But when asked by reporters for evidence, he refused to provide any or  even state his name. \u201cYou're here to take in information\" and \"do your  jobs,\u201d he told them. \"  [https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/10/trump-legal-strategy-election-435853](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/10/trump-legal-strategy-election-435853)",

            "comment": "It's critical that participants in the Trump administration be frozen out. Particularly by universities! There's several tracks to this:\n\n* **The Trump administration was bad for universities**. From visa changes, travel bans, and  the pandemic handling (an extinction event for a lot of universities!), the administration harmed universities, and their faculty and students, often from animus.\n* **The Trump administration was mendacious.** Universities *cannot* function if people lie for personal advantage. That's the #1 principle for academia!  Their lies -- everywhere -- have shown they do not belong to any institution that ever hopes to have a reputation for high standards.\n* **The Trump administration was anti-science and anti-expertise.** CMU has amazing atmospheric researchers -- what a slap to their faces that *anyone* associated with the world's most extreme climate denialism group (the GOP, and more particularly, the Trump administration) would *ever* draw a paycheck or have official association at CMU. The anti-science trends have touched everything, from monetary policy to fuel standards.\n* **The Trump administration** **was anti-young people.** It's not just the rise in inequality, racism, decline in LGBTQ rights, loss of global cooperation, and decline in positive state capability -- it's not just that attacks on our governing system that risk a breakdown of our country and its ability to unify and solve problems -- it's the abnegation on climate change action that will screw over every single person at CMU (and their children and their children etc.) How they expect to sincerely draw students without supporting them is beyond me. University propaganda, I guess.\n\nIt's intolerable that a collaborator, lier, casually cruel, and opportunist like Grenell -- or *any* official from the Trump administration -- was *ever* associated with CMU.\n\nThe best way for CMU to make amends going forward is to announce that any political appointee of the Trump administration or staff of the Trump campaign will not be hired.",

For example, David Urban has taught at CMU and he could be considered the God Father of Trump's \"West Point Mafia\".

We have different opinions on what is right and wrong for our country, but that is okay.  I love hearing diverse opinions.  The problem with Grenell is that he is morally bankrupt and intellectually dishonest.

I'll try to explain my (and others) thinking more clearly without poor internet conduct on my part.\n\nWe're not opposed to him because he's on the \"other team.\" It's because we know he's a troll. He's not actually working sincerely toward decriminalizing homosexuality. It's a statement he uses to garner sympathy and to obscure the fact that he's a political operative.\n\nThere are literally thousands of people with real expertise and experience who are actively working to decriminalize homosexuality who could be supported by CMU to study and teach about this -- meanwhile, Grenell has nothing to show for this in his time in the White House or prior. And this White House had had meaningful backslides on human rights support domestically and abroad, and showed support for countries which *do* persecute LGBTQ individuals.\n\nGrenell himself worked as a consultant with countries that persecute LGBTQ individuals -- not that that's disqualifying, but part of his lack of prioritization on human rights. (Which includes the fact that he works for the party with the notoriously vocal anti-LGBTQ contingent. But I guess where else can you get appointed Acting Director of Intelligence with ZERO intelligence or large bureaucracy experience but the Trump administration?)\n\n\"The Human Rights Campaign, a U.S.-based LGBTQ rights organization, said it has seen \"no meaningful efforts by this administration to decriminalize homosexuality around the world.\"\n\n\"It would be different if they were trying, but it's not even clear they are doing anything meaningful at all,\" said Charlotte Clymer, an HRC spokeswoman. \"It is yet another case of the Trump-Pence White House making promises to LGBTQ people, even while they enable discrimination and violence against us at home and abroad.\"\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/acting-intelligence-head-richard-grenell-s-push-decriminalize-homosexuality-has-n1140131\n\nThis was what we knew about him prior to taking him on at CMU -- that he made statements about decriminalizing homosexuality, but took few meaningful actions toward that in a White House that showed little support for that. His overall role was to be a yes-man in an agency that everyone agreed he wasn't qualified for. (This isn't even to mention his other divisive aspects.\n If you want to know more about him, you can read it here: https://militarist-monitor.org/profile/richard-grenell/. Not unbiased, but well-sourced.)\n\nAnd now -- like nay-sayers suspected -- we see that he has also been spreading false claims of voter fraud and not following virus guidelines expected of the CMU community. Which has been par for the course for the Trump administration.",

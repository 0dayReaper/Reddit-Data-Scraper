    "postText": "I got accepted rd to CMU today! I\u2019m from the nyc area so I love the city of pittsburgh bc it\u2019s a nice change, but still a familiar feeling. However, school/academic wise, I\u2019m conflicted between Pitt and CMU. I enjoy the atmosphere of Pitt better but my CMU financial offer is extremely generous.\n\nWould anyone be able to give me some more insight on the differences between the 2 universities? Or any specific pros about CMU?",

You could still have a social life, technically, but bear in mind that many people come to this \u201csocially dead\u201d school knowing what they are getting . Not necessarily a bad thing, though, especially if you consider yourself an introvert. It can be rather overwhelming to suddenly find yourself in a bunch of people who instantly become friends with everyone and party 24/7.  In CMU you almost get a feeling of being surrounded by like minded, well, introverts.",

From what I\u2019ve seen, your advising experience will be much smoother and getting courses you need will probably be easier at CMU. \n\nAt CMU, you will lose out on sports/social life/parties to some extent, but you\u2019ll make good friends at any college you go to, which is the important thing. And you\u2019re only a short walk or bus ride over from all of the cool stuff that\u2019s around the Pitt campus anyway.\n\nThe Psych major advisors at Pitt are great, but overloaded with a high caseload of students, and students sometimes struggle to get a seat in Research Methods to even declare the Psych major at Pitt. And you have a general/undeclared advisor, not a Psych major advisor, until you can declare your major.\n\nAt Pitt, you have to do any prereqs for the Psychology major (though if you have high enough AP Stat and AP Psych scores, you can get those out of the way before you even start!) and then be actually enrolled in Research Methods at Pitt that semester to declare it. \n\nSome people can\u2019t get into Research Methods until junior year fall or spring because all the seats fill before their enrollment window.\n\nAnd then that means they can\u2019t get into the seats reserved for Psych majors in core classes they need to work on their major requirements for another semester.\n\nStudents and parents also often get frustrated at Pitt because their policies can be confusing and it can be hard to contact/get an answer from an office you need, or you may get bounced or transferred between 3 or 4 different offices before you get an answer for your question. CMU (in my experience) was a lot smoother for students.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong - Pitt is an amazing option, and most students have great experiences there! But if you\u2019ve got a better aid offer from CMU and it would cost less to go there anyway, I would really recommend CMU.",

Think way advance of yourself beyond your college years. Will I meet great minds that will make my life better, even just to have known I am smart enough to be with these also smart colleagues. also pitts is 3mins away from cmu. like you can visit if you need btw",

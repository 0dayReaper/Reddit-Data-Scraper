When you get on, you tell the bus driver the closest intersection to your place. You may be able to take the Oakland escort.",

Will the driver drop you off at any given intersection that\u2019s closest to where you live? Because if so, then I imagine they\u2019ll have to detour a lot and that the ride gonna be long",

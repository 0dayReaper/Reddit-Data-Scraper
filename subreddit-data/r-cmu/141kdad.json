    "postText": "Hi everyone I'm curious to find out more about  CMU's non-academic side (not referring to the social scene, more like the university version of high school extracurriculars basically). I'm getting kind of worried that seeing most students here (esp CS majors) study all day and night long. \n\nI feel like I haven't really heard about the activities CMU offers that can help to prepare me for a career and explore what I want to do. (at this point, I'm not sure if I want to work in tech or finance, or even branch out into other areas, but these are the main areas I would like to explore currently). When I was applying, it also felt like there are slightly less programs and activities here than at other universities? Like theres definitely the student groups and Ideate, and research programs that I'm interested in, but is there more that I haven't discovered that I would only know of when I'm on campus as a student? Do most students actively participate in these extra stuff beyond their studies? (bcos I feel like university should not be just about taking courses tbh)\n\nI'm wondering if CMU has some sort of platform to find all these competitions and activities, so I can browse through? Or do students mainly self-source these opportunities from outside of school?",

Leadership, however, might be tied to being enrolled in a graduate program in order to receive funding from certain sources. \n\nIt's mostly that they don't update TartanConnect due to the extra effort to do so. Most organizations use external platforms like Slack or Discord and don't need the email features or roster that CMU has except for the minimum people (around 5) needed to re-register their org. \n\nThe nice thing about clubs is that it's supposed to be for *you*, the student, and run by students. Each club will have its own expectations, but every member will necessarily understand the difficulty of balancing club goals and academic goals. Many clubs have drop-in meetings where there isn't a commitment, and others will have you sign up for a defined project or task where you'll know what you're contributing.\n\nI'd say no :) there's definitely some visibility and self-marketing issues, and we do have less students overall than some schools, but our rank and presence is well-earned in many extracurriculars. \n\nI'd also look into how we define academics - the [Iris lunar rover](https://irislunarrover.space/) will be the first American, first nano, and first university rover to reach the Moon later this year. Students have had the opportunity to contribute through the Space Robotics course, through volunteering, and through independent research. While it's less of a hackathon-style project, it's still a real (out of this) world opportunity to apply knowledge and learn about industry and research problems.",

There is the factor that masters and PhD level students are more likely to have funding available, but grants are available for any CMU student to participate https://www.cmu.edu/uro/index.html\n\nI would say yes, but the nature of them being independently done makes them less talked about. The ones that are done are genuinely out of passion which is nice. For resume building purposes though, it's just not highlighted or necessary due to internship, research, and entrepreneurship availability.\n\nAny time :)",

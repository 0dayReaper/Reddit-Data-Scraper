At my undergrad, I was able to get distilled water from the chem labs that had a little sink attachment that dispensed distilled water. I am now a grad student stuck in the SCS bubble.\n\nIs it possible for me to get distilled water from the chem labs at CMU, and if so, where do I go to do this?",

It is expensive because of the consumables required to produce it, and you probably should not be using it on plants or for anything outside of research purposes. You should be able to buy distilled water in the grocery store.",

Your best bet would then be to just buy distilled water from somewhere like a grocery store as you need to put distilled water into clothes irons to prevent rusting. Only downside is you're going to be paying way more to water your plants.",

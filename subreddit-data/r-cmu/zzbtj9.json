    "postText": " I took the SAT in August and got 1500 (780M and 720Eng). I took it again in October and got a 1470 (720M and 750 Eng). I am putting extra info about stats below because I can't decide if my app looks stronger without the sat. Could you guys give me your opinion?\n\n \n\nEXTRA INFO about stats:\n\n**GPA:** School doesn't calculate but according to Harvard reading procedures its a 3.72. I know its low but my rigor is pretty good (Full IB)\n\nSenior Year got a 7 (IB) in Math AA SL, as a junior I got a 6. (According to harvard procedures 7 and 6 is a 4.0 GPA)\n\n**Full IB Diploma:** got a 40 (with a 7 in Math AA SL)\n\nSo should I go test-optional or not in your guy's opinion?",

Skibo was probably 20% the size, had no AC, cracked dumbells all over the floor, 7 different brands of weights that you could never find 2 of. \n\nHaving the UC gym be packed most of the time reflects it's quality, it's basically induced demand. Few people worked out in Skibo because you'd get tetanus and a heat stroke in the summer.",

Granted it will be a while before it opens, but that should help reduce crowds in the UC fitness center.\n\nRegardless, having a single gym for the entirety of the school\u2019s students, faculty, and staff does make it far more challenging to take care of your physical health. (I don\u2019t count the Tepper fitness center given that it\u2019s mostly cardio and keeps poor hours, especially during breaks.)",

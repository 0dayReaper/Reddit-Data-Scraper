    "postText": " \n\n I was accepted off the waitlist for Material Science Engineering at UC Berkeley, but I had already committed to CMU hoping to major in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Despite applying for Material Science Engineering at CMU, I was allowed to choose any major within the college of engineering and decided on ECE.\n\nInitially, I had chosen Material Engineering due to my background in Chemistry and Material science-related extracurricular activities. However, I want to ensure that I am making the best decision for my future by carefully considering all my options. The cost difference between UCB and CMU is significant since UCB costs $40K while CMU costs $80K. Although CMU is more expensive, I believe that the academic and student experience will be better as it is a smaller community with a tight-knit community. Moreover, I have heard that at UCB, some low division classes can be hard to enroll in.\n\nI want to make sure that I am making the right decision in sticking with CMU, and to provide some context, I have found that Engineering at Berkeley and CMU are equally prestigious. Additionally, alumni strength and career opportunities are the same for both schools. Can you please provide your perspective and insight on whether I am making the right decision?",

You will choose what you intend to pursue at the end of your first year. \n\nI mention this because if you are interested in material science and you choose CMU, you will be able to try out both material science and ECE assuming you get into the intro courses for each.\n\nYou can try taking the material science intro in fall, and ECE in the spring. \n\nAlso to back what others mentioned I think that CMU just offers more resources to their students.",

The extra $160,000 in cost isn\u2019t worth it for an equally prestigious program with \u201cbetter\u201d opportunities. If they set CMU and UCB opportunities side by side on a table, I would argue you wouldn\u2019t hand over $160,000 for the CMU opportunities when you could have the UCB ones for free. They are plenty good enough.\n\nAnd the cost feels more theoretical now than it will a decade down the road, when you wish you had that $160,000 to put into a house or three decades from now when you really wish you had started to build your nest egg in your 20s with that money.",

CMU, being a much smaller school, felt like it would offer more opportunities with less competition, which I thought was good. imo there's still a reasonably vibrant student life here, and if you really think you're missing out on stuff from a larger school, you can always just walk over to Pitt and hang out with the people there.\n\nGranted, Cal and CMU would've cost about the same for me, but that $160k difference across 4 years could mean a lot to you when deciding.",

            "comment": "\n\n\nCollege of Chemistry (CoC) B.S. from Berkeley and School of Computer Science (SCS) M.S. from CMU.\n\nTo me it sounds like this is a divergence in major. You will likely not be able to get into EECS with all the changes going on currently unless you commit to no life to get that over 3.5 GPA. So the real question is do you like MatSci or ECE more? I\u2019m not super knowledgeable in comparative incomes but it may be worthwhile to reach out to some alumni and see what they say. Glassdoor etc can be hard to discern sometimes.\n\nPrice is a big difference for your parents and you. Honestly I\u2019d argue one of the biggest deciders. Do you plan to do any graduate school? Even if there is an inkling, you may want to consider price more.\n\nMatSci at Cal is top because the CoC is number one in the world. They have just created an autonomous liquid-free lab, and they have an electron microscope, but so does CMU. CMU is also building a cloud lab primarily for chemistry. Cal does have the benefit of housing a national laboratory essentially right next to campus. The LBNL has some pretty intense equipment. The CoC has like 6 different NMRs. I will say that CMU gets you in the classes. My intermediate deep learning class had 75+ on the waitlist and we all got in, while at Cal I\u2019ve not been able to get into an upper div I wanted to take (atmospheric chemistry only like 15 people a sem). That may legit just be lab space in this case so take it lightly.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d say CMU is a smaller tight knit community than Cal, but then again the CoC has 3 majors while the SCS has at least double. So perhaps there is also a college/school influence within the university. College of engineering is pretty big at both schools. Socially, Cal has a weather advantage, being able to lay on memorial lawn almost all year is prime. CMU has a lot of rain and it does get cold so people just stay in sometimes.\n\nHonestly, there is no wrong choice, they are both excellent schools that will get you where you want to be.",

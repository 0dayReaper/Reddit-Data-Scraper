    "postText": "I am working as a SDE2, and have been in the industry for the last 4.5 years.\n\nI got an admit from CMU MSE for Fall 2023, and expecting from Gatech MS CS. I am finding it hard to decide which one I would choose. I am inclining towards Gatech because of less cost and the option to study more core CS &amp; ML courses, whereas CMU has a better brand name and Masters of software engineer program has some leadership oriented courses as well.\nNeed some suggestions.",

This might be out of date now but in 2020 MSE-SS had a 47% acceptance rate, and MSE 21% while I remember seeing a 10-12% acceptance rate at gatech a while back, though I can\u2019t seem to find the link right now. GaTech has only the one big program while CMU has a whole bunch of small ones.",

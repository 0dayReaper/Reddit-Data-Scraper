My feeling is that most classes teach you the basics and expect you to struggle to figure out the hw/projcets.\n\nNow re your questions: \n\nLecture - most (80%) of them are useful \n\nHands on - depends on the type of the class, but what should be hands on is usually indeed hands on\n\nCollaborative - yes, people work with each other a lot in SCS\n\nReal world - it's not difficult to find a job after you graduate, if that's what you meant \n\nHow involved are professors - I feel at least half are really interested in helping students learn; 30% are okay; the rest just don't care",

I haven't had a bad one and most have been phenomenal. \nHaving said that, they do not spoon feed us or test by regurgitation. They expect you to fundamentally understand concepts and use them to solve problems in different ways. To me that is the heart of CMU and why some people struggle. My friends at MIT and Stanford say the same, and I sometimes think this is what separates these programs from others. Most people memorized their way through high school with ease, and it is a completely different process here. But the support system is amazing, including profs, ta's, and students.",

They may be difficult and they may often cover more material than other peer universities, but it's fundamentally a doable workload. We don't try to weed people out for the sake of weeding people out, everyone who can do the work is welcome aboard. With the exception of those with severe mental health issues, I genuinely believe that anyone who puts in the effort can make it to graduation.",

The professors just refused to get involved and would suggest things like \"have better communication,\" so I had to do the work of like 2 people to keep an A in the class, while my teammates got a free A out of it. I wish SCS would get rid of most group projects or else be prepared to actually differentiate grading based off of whether or not everyone involved actually did the work.",

I've seen a decent number of \"friend\" groups dissolve over group work (and usually with many sob stories launched against the people who actually do the work). A lot of people just suck it up to keep their social circle intact.\n\nI guess it does prepare you for life, in a way... :)",

            "comment": "The main thing you need to worry about is the tuition fee, that\u2019s standard and differs for each program. Health insurance is taken once a year and if you go with CMU\u2019s health insurance, it\u2019s a one time payment in Fall and it lasts until the end of Summer. \nBooks/ Supplies don\u2019t matter because I haven\u2019t really seen any grad student buy books, it\u2019s all available online or in the library. University fees includes transportation fees( the free bus pass we use), student activities fees etc. Not sure why they haven\u2019t mentioned the Fall\u201923 fees yet, but it\u2019s going to be around the same as last year. \nLastly rent completely depends on the individual preference. There are students who pay 400-500$ a month and there are also students who pay 1800$ a month, it completely depends on your budget and living expenses. Don\u2019t go by the amount mentioned here.",

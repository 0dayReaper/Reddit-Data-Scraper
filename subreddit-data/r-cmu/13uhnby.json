    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI'm currently a freshman studying Computer Science at an Ivy (think Columbia/Penn/Yale - I was actually admitted to all three hehe).\n\nAnyway, I really haven't had a great time and am thinking of transferring. I've lost a lot of the things that were really important to me - mainly a certain sport - which I could play D3 at CMU. Though I do have several other reasons for transferring as well.\n\nOnly problems are my GPA (\\~3.6) and that I was not originally a CS major - which may make it very hard to get into CMU School of Computer Science.\n\n\\*I was admitted to CMU as a first year, but applied only to the school of engineering for context\n\n\\*Also maybe my rigorous course-load (\\~19 credits/6 classes per semester) somewhat compensates for my GPA? I'm about 45% done with my BS after the first year\n\nOn the other hand my Computer Science GPA is 4.0 (A's in 3 classes) and I'm doing a FAANG internship this summer (not sure how I got this, basically was teaching myself computer science the summer after I graduated high school).\n\nSo I'm not really sure where I stand, tho from what I've heard CMU SCS is basically impossible to transfer into.\n\nMy original plan was to go to my current school for 3 years, get a BS in Comp Sci and then do an MS in CS (Stanford/Princeton/etc).\n\nThough I'm not too sure now, and transferring would def put me off track this.\n\nAlso I missed the application deadline, so I'd have to wait a year for that (might take a gap), or I could even apply as a spring transfer, and go to my current school for next semester fall.\n\nPlease let me know what you think or if you have any advice - thanks!",

The stress culture is rampant and therapist visits are at an all-time high to the point that they have a two month waitlist sometimes. But if CMU fits your needs (personal, social, financial, etc.) you should come. But I don't think you should just because you want a \"better\" time at CMU",

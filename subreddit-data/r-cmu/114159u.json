    "postText": "I really wanted to go see Babel (the CMU theater production) this Friday. On the box office website it said tickets would go on sale at noon the day before. I checked today at 12:07 PM and tickets were already gone.\n\nDo tickets to the theater productions really sell that fast? Or is there some way to buy theme early I don't know about?\n\nMore importantly, is there any way I can see Babel? I thought the description sounded really cool and now I'm seriously regretting missing my opportunity.",

I think if you show up 45 minutes before you can put your name down but it might be 1.5 hours. I would recommend checking in at noon tomorrow when the box office opens and asking them for information on the waitlist, I hope you can get to see it",

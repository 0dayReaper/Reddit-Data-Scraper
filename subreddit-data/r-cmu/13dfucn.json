    "postText": "So this semester I took 21-127 which I know is a coreq for 15-122. But I decided to take 127 before because I didn't have space in my schedule. My grade in 127 is really close to failing and I'm not 100% sure if I'm going to pass. If I fail, would I still be able to take 122 next fall? Or should I look for backup courses just in case?",

They\u2019re also very different courses so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about your experience in concepts impacting your ability to do well in 122 (although, depending on your schedule, it might make sense to push back 122 so you can retake concepts while it\u2019s still fresh in your mind). Good luck!!",

Though I expect it did.",

As you said, though, I would assume it\u2019s more of a correlation thing since (at least from what I could see) there\u2019s basically no overlap in content (aside from \u201cwriting proofs\u201d I guess) between the two courses.",

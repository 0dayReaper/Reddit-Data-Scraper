Skills covered include hand building, sketching and modeling for larger fireable clay forms, throwing on the wheel, and basic glazing techniques. Discussions will include contemporary artists working in ceramics, as well as historical examples, and various approaches and techniques for working in clay.\n\n60-433 Advanced SIS: Ceramics\nIntermittent: 10 units\nClay is a primary building block of sculpture. This supple, responsive and versatile material is being incorporated into the work of many contemporary artists today. This class will ask students to create projects that explore the use of clay as a medium in the context of their own work. It is intended for students who would like to specialize in clay sculpture, as well as students who work primarily in other mediums. Projects will originate from self-generated ideas. Class critiques will stress group participation to broaden viewpoints and sharpen critical abilities. The majority of class time will be for studio projects. The use of mixed media is allowed. A materials fee is required.",

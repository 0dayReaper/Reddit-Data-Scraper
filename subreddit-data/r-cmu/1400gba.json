    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI just finished my graduated degree at CMU, and my landlord requested that I see if there was another CMU student that would like to take over my apartment in July (or potentially August.)  I have lived here for 6 years, and I wanted to help him out because he has been good to me.  All of the details are in the listing below.  You are welcome to contact the landlord directly (info in listing) or send me a DM.\n\n[https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/124-Elysian-St-APT-1-Pittsburgh-PA-15206/2100039537\\_zpid/](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/124-Elysian-St-APT-1-Pittsburgh-PA-15206/2100039537_zpid/)  \n\n\nJust to note, this is a throw away account because I don't want to post my address with my main account.  If you dm me your Andrew ID, I can email you from my CMU email to confirm my identity.",

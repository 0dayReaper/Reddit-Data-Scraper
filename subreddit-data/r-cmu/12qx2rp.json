    "postText": "I'm trying to live outside of Pittsburgh for the entirety of the Fall semester, anyone know of classes (or professors that tend to have such policies) that dont have in-person midterms or no midterms at all, and no mandatory attendance? It doesn't have to be an easy class, I'll self-study for the course, I just need to be able to complete the class while abroad.\n\nSadly, there's little to no full 9 unit remote classes this Fall that I can take (stat major).\n\nA single, in-person final is fine, I just need to be able to complete the majority of the course while away from Pittsburgh. I'm already taking Topics of Law. I'm also considering 36-350 because apparently theres no midterms.",

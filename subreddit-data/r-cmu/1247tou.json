It was rather heavy, I kept microsleeping in 312 lecture towards the second half of the semester.\n\nI don't recommend taking _both_ 451 and 315 with your workload above. Consider 445 + (451 or 315) + 312? Should be doable either way, it's more of a \"how much life outside of classes do you want this semester?\" thing.",

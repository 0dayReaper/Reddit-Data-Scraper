Don't count on the wifi being functional, though, that's hit or miss.\n\nBe prepared for the train station to be basically just a room and a couple of vending machines; if you're used to big train stations with lots of space and shops and things, that's not what you'll find here.",

Most routes in the us can\u2019t go faster than 79mph and trains don\u2019t turn easily which is a problem between here and Harrisburg.  The tracks from Harrisburg to Philly can go  110mph and Philly to nyc support 125 mph.",

Also, it seems the power outlets are only at the window seat, and not on the aisle. If someone else knows different, let me know! But overall she likes it. Book early for the best prices.",

I have only used Amtrak from NYC to DC and I loved the experience most of the time and I always rode 1st Class\u2014I had one situation with an attendant (older woman) who was pretty rude to me because she thought I was a child (I was 23, at the time). I got pretty upset so one of the other attendants comforted me and told me that he\u2019d tell her to leave me alone and that he\u2019d service me whenever I needed though. \ud83e\udd79",

            "comment": "From what I can tell, everyone gets put on the priority waitlist, and CMU puts way too many people on the waitlist for reasons I truly do not understand. I think SCS put over 100 people on the waitlist when they knew they were at max going to let like 3 people off. It is a shitty practice. Do not hold out hope for the CMU waitlist if you are applying for one of the more competitive programs (ECE, CS, etc). Probably best to move on.",

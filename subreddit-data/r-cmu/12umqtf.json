Additionally, if a pass is required or there are reserved spots is there an option to provide for more than one vehicle?\n\nAlso, any bike storage in building?\n\nWill the apartment be completely sanitized before I move in? Very concerned about viral infection with my immunodeficiency.\n\nAre pets allowed? I have a sweet Ruttwheiler I\u2019d like to bring over with me.\n\nCan I get a rent discount if I furnish the apartment myself? I realistically have everything I need and more. \n\nYou mention a roomate, but you say \u201cfemale graduate students\u201d ?? I am very confused are there multiple people or just one? Additionally I would need some slightly more information on these people / this person to see if we would be compatible roommates.\n\nIs there central heat / ac? Does it vary / is it adjustable between rooms? I am very serious about temperature so if it is not adjustable then again that plays in to the roomate situation where we would have to have similar temperature interests.\n\nAre there restrictions on the lease that involve entry before / after certain times?  And Are there restrictions on the lease that involve limits on guests?\n\nAre there restrictions on the lease that involve power usage? And would I be able to paint my room if I return it to the previous color? I am very concerned about how environment / color affects my productivity.\n\nJust a few questions and if you could get back to me please let me know. \n\n-rb",

Even for the newest dorm that was built last year.\n\nHowever, there should be a dorm or two (haven't kept up, been a while since I was freshman) that have suites w/ a kitchen shared among just you and your roommates, which I would recommend. Not sure if they're available to freshmen, but look for options like Fifth Neville/Rez on Fifth. They also unlock the yellow meal plan, which is much smaller and a better deal. The lowest everyone else can go is the red plan, which most people don't manage to finish and end up throwing away blocks at the end.\n\nI actually got the yellow plan and still had 30+ blocks at the end :') guess I cooked too much",

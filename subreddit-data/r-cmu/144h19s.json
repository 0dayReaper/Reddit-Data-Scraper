You can reasonably have two of either a car, one bedroom apartment, good location (as in, walkable for most day to day and great access to the bus system) and also save a bit. Most other places you can get one (some places none), and won\u2019t be saving much if at all. $40K you could probably have all three if you\u2019re fine with not saving much and a cheaper car",

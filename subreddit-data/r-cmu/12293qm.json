    "postText": "Hi, I'm in quite a predicament here as a senior from high school. I got waitlisted but for my third choice of college, mellon school of college. I applied my first and second choice for college of arts and bcsa, respectively, which is majorly what I wished to study for college. Is there a possibility that I will be able to switch to the college of arts after getting in (if i get off the waitlist, but i've been given 'priority' for the list) from the mellon college of science? Are there any suggestions on what I should or could do?",

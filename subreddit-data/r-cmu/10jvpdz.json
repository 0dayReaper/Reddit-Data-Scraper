It is used as the grading infrastructure for a lot of courses, and if thing don't work locally it can be used as a workaround.",

See [https://www.cmu.edu/computing/services/endpoint/software/how-to/timeshare-linux.html](https://www.cmu.edu/computing/services/endpoint/software/how-to/timeshare-linux.html)\n\nI don't think there is a lot of cases that there are programs only available on windows, especially in the CS related courses (most of the time Linux works, if not better, and you can run them on a server if you don't need a GUI. Probably only for graphics related courses you will need a GUI like 15-462, but I think ARM Macbooks still work for that course).",

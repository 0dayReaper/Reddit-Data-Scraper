    "postText": "I am admitted to both colleges and am choosing between the two for undergrad. Both school seem to have similar rankings for design (on Niche). \n\nThe pros for WashU is that the campus is really beautiful and the school atmosphere is very good. I want to spend my four years in a strong college-spirit place. Also, WashU has a much higher ranking according to U.S. news (top 15). It might be better on my resume since I\u2019m probably going to have a master too.\n\nThe pros for CMU is that it has strong science and technology programs.  I think my future career is closer to AI and UX design and VR/AR. So CMU might give me better preparation. Yet, WashU also provides those classes (e.g. it has a minor in human computer interaction) .",

            "comment": "The educations are both excellent. I will say CMU design is more reputable (I have a minor and interviewers have been impressed).  Interactive design is the future and CMU is at the forefront of that IMO. Plus with HCI available too it\u2019s only getting better.\n\nNow with that being said: if you feel more comfortable at WashU go to washu. CMU\u2019s environment is tough for some including myself, it\u2019s competitive and difficult. I imagine washu is about the same, but prioritize where you feel you would be happier. The educations are both going to be excellent.",

But seriously, all my HCI friends and peers are getting great jobs at top companies straight out of college. If you want a masters, all HCI majors have an opportunity of getting an accelerated masters in HCI in just 2 more semesters (summer + fall). Being in the HCI scene at cmu, I can confidently say CMU would be the right choice here in terms of job prospects, skills learned, and masters degree prospects",

            "comment": "Honest CMU is maybe one of the top in UX design based on personal experience. I've worked with UX designers before, but the ones from CMU are different animals. The opportunities for design students are endless, and the job prospects are insane for HCI students. I am not sure if WashU really would be better for you, especially if you want UX design in the tech industry.\n\nI worked with 2 UX designers from the BHCI program in a startup (Expii) and all I can say is that they were outrageously amazing to work with. One went to Amazon and the other went to NASA JPL. The program is clearly rigorous, they were very spot on in capturing exactly what the end users wanted, and they were both not yet graduated in the startup at the time. I can't recommend the program enough.",

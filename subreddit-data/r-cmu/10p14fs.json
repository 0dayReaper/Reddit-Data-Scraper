    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m looking for a quiet, tidy, female roommate (current student) for a 2bed/2bath apartment in Squirrel Hill South. The apartment has renovated kitchen, washer dryer in unit and the rental company is very responsive. The bedroom available has a big walk in closet, lots of natural sunlight, and fits a queen size bed with lots of room to spare! Super convenient and safe location (5 min walk to 61 bus stop to campus, 5 min walk to Murray Ave., 20 min walk to campus). Rent for the room is $800+utilities(~$50-60)/month. Feel free to pm me if you\u2019re interested in pictures/more info as I\u2019m trying to find a roommate to renew the lease with by mid February :)",

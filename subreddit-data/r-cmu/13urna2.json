If you get waitlisted, send him an email saying you\u2019re interested in the class and would like a spot in later semesters, it\u2019s the best way to get a spot if you\u2019re outside the school of music (music students get first priority). Riccardo is fr the GOAT, he OG as fuck.",

Outstanding teaching style and very communicative and invested into his students' growth. Its a great beginners course to concepts. \nAlso recommend Digital Service Innovation under Laura Vinchesi and Adam Paulisick. Hands-on activities, interesting assignments. Just that you need to be in class at 8am sharp xD",

I found it really interesting, and it was nice to see a professor so passionate about their field. I would warn that it is quite a bit of work towards the end of the semester, as you have to write a pretty hefty research paper on a dictatorship of your choice for the final.",

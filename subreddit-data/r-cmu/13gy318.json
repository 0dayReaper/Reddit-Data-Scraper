            "comment": "The tuition adjustment deadlines are:  \nMay 19 for Mini-5 &amp; Summer 1  \nMay 26 for Summer All  \nJuly 7 for Mini-6 and Summer 2\n\nThe summer payment due date is May 15. CMU offers a grace period until the end of the month. Any unpaid balance at the end of May would incur a 1.5% interest fee.\n\nIf you drop a course prior to that course's tuition adjustment deadline, the tuition for that course will be removed about three days after you drop the course. If you drop a course after that course's tuition adjustment deadline, you are responsible for paying the full tuition for that course. There is an appeal process, but it is for extenuating circumstances.",

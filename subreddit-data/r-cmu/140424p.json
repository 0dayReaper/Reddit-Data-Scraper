    "postText": "What books apart from your coursework reading have you found interesting and actually useful?\n\nI am not necessarily talking about reading books not aligned with your major. Though that is definitely an option.\n\nDo you read fiction? or non-fiction?\n\nOr books on a subject you are taking that are not on the recommended reading list?\n\nWhich books did you really like?",

I really don't think as many people here read fiction books for fun as perhaps your high school, but there certainly are a lot of people who do read. I would imagine your academic college also influences who reads books, such as SCS probably doesn't read as much as Dietrich.",

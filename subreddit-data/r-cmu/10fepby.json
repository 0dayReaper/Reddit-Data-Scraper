    "postText": "I just checked FCEs and Pisztora's was higher than all other past professors for 21-355. Can anyone talk about his version of Real Analysis and how he is as a professor in general?\n\nFor reference, I'm not a math major and I haven't taken another math class here beyond 21-256 multivariate calc which was like four semesters ago. I'm a senior so I can't exactly wait to take 255 with a different professor.\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Pisztora is dope, his homework grading policy was mainly effort based and so long as you attempted the problems and had work that showed genuine thought you\u2019d get good grades on them.  His tests were pretty fair imo (nothing super fucked and if it was a difficult problem he\u2019d give you hints).  He\u2019s very relaxed with extensions (gave it everytime, even when I\u2019d email the night before) and is very chill in general.  He made the concepts seem intuitive and presented the material in a way that made me genuinely enjoy the class.  He\u2019s the opposite of strict.  \n\nHopefully this helps!",

Right away after I applied for the statuses on both reads as \"in consideration\".  How long did it take for most to get a response from CMU for an interview?",

I've applied to several positions and for most (if not all of them) it usually took 2-3 weeks from the time i applied before i heard back with either a rejection or an interview request. \n\nI've also had some where i never heard back. If it had been over a month, I assumed they'd moved on with other candidates.",

    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman at CMU ECE and I'm looking at the sample degree plans for CMU ECE, but they are generalized. Currently, I have a 5 in AP Calc BC and AP CS A, and I'm expecting to get 5s on both AP Physics C: Mechanics and AP Physics C: E&amp;M (hopefully). Would anyone be willing to share their 4-year course curriculum with me for reference in my curriculum planning? \n\nI'm interested in potentially also majoring in CS so if any of y'all have schedules with CS/software as the main specialization/as an additional major that would be a great help! Thanks!",

However there probably aren't a lot of options in your first year so just listen to your advisor and you'll be fine. \nAnd, no matter what you think right now, you're plans will change before you graduate.\nRelax and enjoy the ride",

There's some historical information on when these classes were offered before, but it's no guarantee for the future.",

            "comment": "This might be a bit late, but I\u2019m a rising junior in ECE who was in a similar position to you (but my plans have somewhat changed since coming to CMU). I definitely agree with what other people have said about interests changing a huge amount over the course of your academic and extracurricular career at CMU. With that being said, there are a few things that I personally regret, including some things suggested by advisors.\n\nFor example, unless you are looking at graduating super early, I wouldn\u2019t be too concerned about getting ECE degree requirements (especially geneds and math/science electives) done early. First semester I think the schedule that would best set you down CS/ECE (ignoring difficulty) would be at least two of 21-127, 21-241, 15-122, and 18-100. (21-241 is debatable because 18-202 can fill prereqs for a combo of 21-241, 21-259, and 21-260, but 18-202 isn\u2019t guaranteed as a freshman).\n\nHonestly, to a certain degree, I would say 18-100 would be the easiest to push to a later semester because not many people take anything that has 18-100 as a prereq in spring. Taking these four classes together would almost certainly be a horrible idea, especially as a first semester where you are getting used to college life, and ideally you would be spending a lot of time making friends, joining EC\u2019s and otherwise taking it somewhat chill.\n\nI really advise against taking 21-254 even if your advisor suggests you take it, unless you don\u2019t care about unlocking classes that have 21-241 or 21-259 as a prereq. I\u2019ve been able to get exemptions for 21-259 but it\u2019s annoying because it basically forces you to be reliant on your advisor to override SIO. Also, in my opinion the material is much more in common with 21-241, but almost no courses accept 21-254 as a prereq in the place of 21-241.\n\nObviously, first year, you need to take some other intro engineering (many people do CIVE), and first year writing. Many people enjoy the minis over interp. It would be nice to take 15-150 in spring but not super critical. 15-150 is vastly better in spring than fall so keep that in mind when scheduling classes, and knowing that it is a prereq for 15-210 and if I\u2019m not wrong also some other CS cores. \n\nIf you really want to go down the software side of things, assuming you aren\u2019t going to take summer classes, 18-213 would be nice to take freshman spring but ngl its pretty impossible to get software classes in sophmore year so its not too important to take in freshman year. The only realistic ones in sophomore year are probably 18-330, 15-462, and 18-349 (you can ask Kesden to waive 18-240 as a prereq). If you have a light freshman spring, consider trying for 18-240 because IMO (and all my friends agree) its the most time intensive core, and a lab class, but it is definitely a step up in harshness of grading relative to many of the other courses I\u2019ve mentioned previously. \n\n18240 is historically easier in spring, and also due to hardware courses being fall only, it makes the most sense to take 18-240 in a spring semester. 18220 makes sense to take in a fall semester because 18320 is a spring only course.\n\nI think beyond that it isn\u2019t too important what you take when because your interests will almost certainly change, and also registering for software classes as an ECE major is horrible (even as a junior, I\u2019m on the waitlist for 15-440, which is less in demand than other systems classes such as 15445).\n\nPersonally, for freshman fall, I\u2019d view it as a time to get used to college, and not take too heavy of a course load, because you can always readjust your course-load in future semesters based on how hard/easy you felt it was.",

Please note that 15-213 does not count towards your ECE degree.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an international student from India and I do CAIE A-Levels. I\u2019ll be joining CMU\u2019s class of 2027 as a Physics Major. \n\nI had all A*s in my IGCSEs and all A^ in my AS Levels and my A Level Mid years. My predicted grades were A star A star  A start A star.  \n\nIn March 2023 I gave my 4 A level exams and also gave AS level English and I ended up getting A star A start A star A in my A levels but I got an E in AS level English. \n\nNow I know most universities don\u2019t consider AS level grades but I\u2019m not sure about CMU. \n\nIs there a chance my offer gets rescinded? I have already met the English language requirement by giving TOEFL.\n\nThanks",

Figured this is the best place to ask (lest I send an email). \n\nQuestion 1: In the title.\n\nQuestion 2: Can I submit multiple papers?\n\nQuestion 3: Is it fun to actually go and watch presentations or should I just submit/read proceedings later? (I live a large distance away from CMU)\n\nThanks!",

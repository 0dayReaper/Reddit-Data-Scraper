    "postText": "Hi! Looking for advice from fellow CS majors here- I could graduate a semester early if I wanted to (and boy do I want to). The only thing holding me back is me wondering if taking cloud computing (15319) and operating systems (15410) is worth staying an extra semester for (no, not both at once, don\u2019t scold me). If I graduate early, I\u2019ll likely find a job or internship for the last semester I would have been in school. So, I guess my question is: what is better for my career? Taking a few extra classes (and paying handily for them)? Or getting some more experience?",

            "comment": "I'm a current senior in CS who made a similar decision: I could have graduated a semester early, but I decided to stay at CMU for the semester. I ended up taking compilers and a couple of lighter classes. Personally, I chose to stay as a student because I was already committed to being in Pittsburgh for the semester due to some extracurricular commitments, and there were lots of cool classes at CMU that I wanted to take, so I decided that I might as well take some.\n\nGenerally, some thoughts about taking another semester vs. graduating early:\n\n- Tuition is not cheap (though you can pay less by being a part-time student). Everyone's financial situation is different, so take a look at what this means for you.\n- Classes are not that stressful if you know you've already satisfied your graduation requirements and will graduate no matter what, and especially if you've already signed a job offer (which you probably will have by your senior spring). You can also take classes pass/fail.\n- Depending on how much you like Pittsburgh/CMU/the college experience, staying another semester can be very personally rewarding. This may be especially true if you lost a substantial amount of time in college to COVID. You have decades to work but only another ~year to goof off, stay up absurdly late talking with friends, etc.\n- There are lots of awesome classes here that you might not have gotten a chance to try while taking the CS core. You could theoretically learn this stuff on your own later, but at least personally I doubt that I actually would.\n- If your primary concern is what is better for your career, I will say that additional work experience will pretty much always trump an extra class, even if that class is OS. But also, I highly doubt that a few months of work will really affect the long-term trajectory of your career.\n- You've probably already done this (or will do this), but talking to your advisor is always a good idea for anything registration or graduation related.",

It would be for your own personal satisfaction.\n\nI personally don't think any one course at CMU is worth 25k, but it depends on your own financial situation.",

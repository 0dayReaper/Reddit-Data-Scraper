    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of  the School of Architecture. After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to  write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.\n\nArchitecture studio is home to many an underground enterprise of questionable legality. There was the [private barber service](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/p06fkw/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_18_shave_and_a/), the secret studio fridge bar, and a [private petting zoo](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/n7f4nf/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_1_the_legend_of/), to name a few that are not necessarily punishable by law. The department staff likewise is fraught with certain shenanigans that they do not like to see made public, whether it\u2019s one [school head\u2019s private hidden camera installed in his office](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/rxy79g/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_33_head_perks/), a [professor giving hard liquor to students](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/t986ay/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_37_a_toast_with/), or the [department accepting a nice new plotter in exchange for giving an otherwise failing student a passing grade in studio](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/w4zahe/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_52_the_plot_to/). Well, there\u2019s much more that could be said that could really put a dent in their gilded image; but none of this is out of spite. After all, there are lessons to be learned from these tales and a wonderfully rich and colorful history of life in architecture school to be preserved. As to a questionable enterprise actually ran by Soarch staff instead of students, one comes to mind: the routine smuggling of otherwise unobtainable goods.\n\nThat\u2019s right. This came from a certain recruiter within the office who was keen on offering me access to this particularly addictive substance. For you see, some staff made routine visits to Europe and would supposedly bring an extra suitcase just to smuggle this stuff during their flights. Pay them cash upon their return and they will provide the goods. This formula was not sold in America nor could it otherwise be shipped here. It was apparently worth the effort despite the legal red tape making other methods of importation impossible.\n\nWhat was the stuff? Jars upon jars of actual Nutella. I kid you not. No, it was not the Americanized version riddled with artificial junk but the original formula straight from Italy. At the time, it was not allowed in the states except through a legal loophole: it could be bought in the duty free zones of European airports and carried in one\u2019s luggage already safely behind the security barriers. Thus this enterprise went on year after year. As soon as a staff member announced plans to travel there, coworkers would line up to confirm their order would be in the next shipment.\n\nHaving tasted \u201cimported\u201d European chocolates before, I can confirm this enterprise to be too sweet to pass up. Just ask the coordinator with a sweet tooth about it.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d",

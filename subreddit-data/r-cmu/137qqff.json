    "postText": "Well, there are so few undergraduates at CMU that it's hard to find general discussions anywhere (or maybe I'm just not well-educated in how to use the internet), and all the CMU guys I currently know were excellent in high school. I paid my deposit. I turned down all offers from other schools in April (one of them even gave me a fullride scholarship QaQ).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took the AP Chemistry exam on Monday of this week. My semester grade was a B-. The semester grades for our AP courses are locked in before their respective AP exams.  (The last semester grade I used for my RD was a B)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just took the final exam for my AP Calc AB class this Tuesday and the teacher refused to use the curve and said he would use raw percentages (hey, I got a 79/108 which was the highest score in the class but you know it looks horrible in raw percentages) (he designed the test himself so there was no basis for my review) (considering I already got an A before he entered the final grade. I might be able to balance a B?) (I used an A for last semester's grade in RD because last semester's final was easier)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow comes the dreaded question, I am taking both AP Physics 1 and AP Physics C this semester (my school didn't let us take regular physics classes until 11th grade. I started AP Physics 1 last fall, which is a year-long course) (I used my last semester grade of A- for RD). However, I joined AP Physics C (which is a year-long course) halfway through the beginning of my second semester. The final exam for this class is very, very hard. I will probably be torn between a high C/low B in Physics C and a high B/low A in AP Physics 1. (Both courses are offered on an online platform with my school, so my mum has no way to see my grades, unlike my other courses where she panics when she sees an A- or lower. Technically, we'd both be panicking)   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, will a C in AP Physics cause my acceptance offer to be rescinded? (Considering it's actually a course related to my major) (I don't need any of my APs to graduate. Our school has very low graduation standards and I should probably be able to graduate by the end of my junior year)",

Wrote about a combination of focusing on extracurriculars/clubs/family stuff, and I was a-ok. It was honestly mostly not giving af anymore after accepting my offer but didn't say that in my essay lol. you'll be fine",

I\u2019ve seen this question being asked on this subreddit so many times, this year alone. Also, this subreddit is pretty active with discussion. And if that\u2019s not enough, there are dedicated Discord servers (unofficial, student run) for each undergraduate class.\n\nShort answer: no, they\u2019re not going to recsind you for 1 C",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a rising Junior pursuing ECE/BME, and I tried really hard to get an internship for this summer but to no avail. Currently I'm just registered for 18213 over the summer but I'm paranoid that I'm essentially wasting my summer in a fruitless manner. I've heard about the SURA research, but I'm not too sure what it is or what it entails beyond that it's a research opportunity for inexperienced undergrads. Would it still be possible to get a SURA opportunity now? The deadline is May 22nd, but Im worried it might be too late.",

Yours might already be answered!\n\nPlease consider posting to subs like /r/pittsburgh for general life in Pittsburgh questions, dedicated subs like /r/chanceme, /r/ApplyingToCollege, and /r/collegeresults for odds of getting accepted, and using the search in the sidebar.\n\n^(If I've misidentified your post, please ignore this message and instead take it as a reminder to contribute your own answers to the megathread.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

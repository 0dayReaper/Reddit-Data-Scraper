    "postText": "Apologies for bothering this subreddit again, but I'm curious about whether the professors usually prefer MS CS and MS Robotics people, or there's a decent chance of getting in. \n\nI have experience working under a computer vision lab in undergrad, took a vision and deep learning class as well. Hoping signal processing experience counts for something as well.",

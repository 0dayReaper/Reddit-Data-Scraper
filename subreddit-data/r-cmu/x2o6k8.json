    "postText": "Soap isn't optional. I can't speak to the womens' bathroom practices, but way too many of you fucks in the mens' bathroom need to start washing your hands.\n\nSticking  your hand under water for literally two seconds isn't enough. The irony is that some of you goblins are wearing a mask too. I'm really not a germaphobe, but you fucks have caused me to be hypervigilant over every fucking thing I touch on campus. I wouldn't be here if you at least made an effort to maybe put a little soap on your hand, and fake scrub for a couple seconds. You dipshits either think you're doing a satisfactory job, or you don't give a shit. But if you don't give a shit, why even bother rinsing your hands? You're not fucking fooling anybody.\n\nAnd no, this isn't a rare case. In my three years on campus 100% (yes 100% - I keep count) of the time, if I'm in a bathroom with at least one other person, they do a shit job of washing their hands.",

I know some of the custodians on campus and they do not have the manpower (or supplies) to make sure every surface is clean for you (thanks Aramark I sure hope your execs make a few extra bucks so you don't have to replace broken equipment).\n\nGet some deodorant and apply it daily. Just because you can't smell yourself doesn't mean others don't.\n\nGates in particular is bad because of the narrower hallways. BO lingers and the closer people are together the more you smell.",

    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture. After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.\n\nHere there are stories, some about students, some about staff. Sometimes, stories happen when staff were students. Such is the case with this short tale the old head liked to share with the next generation.\n\nBack in the seventies, the groovy architecture school was not as well funded as it is today with all its digital gadgets to help students create their masterpieces. At one point, there wasn\u2019t funding for everyone to have new desks but an opportunity came along in the form of salvaged doors. A student was tasked between semesters to take those doors and chop them in half down in woodshop. Add a few legs and each half became a desk. It was no easy task but eventually there were desks for everyone that year that needed it for their work.\n\nLike the young lad in the old sailing song that eventually became a captain through labor, that student went on to become a professor for the school and eventually served a few terms as head. Even while head, the grizzly old man would like to retell this story to students working for the department, perhaps as a reminder of where he started or perhaps as an inspiration for what they might become years down the road. As for those improvised desks made from salvaged doors, none have been known to survive but they would make a curious relic for the school\u2019s archives, if ever found.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d\n\n  ",

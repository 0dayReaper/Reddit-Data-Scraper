    "postText": "I'm a costume (SoD) student who wants to record a short reel of my thesis project in an analogue b/w movie format. \n\nCurrently, I have access to a hand cranked lomokino, which is basically a child's toy and a very lightweight, jittery operation. I also have single and super 8 options, but the film and development is expensive. 35mm was used for the original literary source material, but I understand these cameras are either rare or expensive, or both. Thus, 16mm being a consideration. \n\nOur shoot is planned for about three hours at Mellon Park, pre-, and then during golden hour, in the week preceding April 21st (date tbd very soon), but I would be fine with the use of this particular camera for an hour or less. Honestly, we can knock this out in half an hour if you're very confident with your tools.\n\nI'd be willing to hear what someone considers adequate pricing to rent the camera, or we can discuss trade. I would provide the film to be used, and if you'd rather just rent the camera and not your time, we can discuss collateral. You will also be credited within the text and video content of the thesis.\n\nIf you want to be part of a unique science fantasy, Jules Verne acid trip costume recording session, please reply or PM me.",

I've looked at different equipment rental lists offered across campus and have not been able to find a camera that records movies on analog film, as in how it would have been done in the 1930s. I already have all of my digital recording equipment covered. I checked the lending list again just now and didn't see the option, unfortunately.\n\nI might go in person and see if there's something not listed.",

Unfortunately a simulation or rendering would defeat my goal of learning if my garment can successfully interact with both digital and analog media.",

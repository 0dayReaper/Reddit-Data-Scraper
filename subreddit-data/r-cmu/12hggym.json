    "postText": "I have worked on developing a proof system for 15-150 that allows students to write proofs and receive immediate feedback on them as they do so. I have also created a small test to evaluate the usability/usefulness of the system. If you are a student who has taken 15-150 before, your feedback would be invaluable to us.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe evaluation test will involve a series of four short proof exercises that you will complete using the system (called Silkie). Your feedback on the system's usability, functionality, and effectiveness will be collected through a questionnaire at the end of the test. The test can be accessed at\u00a0[https://logic.qatar.cmu.edu/silkie/test/](https://logic.qatar.cmu.edu/silkie/test/).\n\nIf you have the time, then I strongly encourage you to take the test as your feedback will help in improving the system and the learning experience for future students. Note that you do not have to finish the exercises to provide feedback, all we ask for is an honest attempt to test the system.",

    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming freshman at CMU. I was admitted to Tepper for the Business Administration major. I am planning on completing a CS dual major, but I was wondering if it is feasible. I know it will be very difficult, so I plan on working very hard. Does anyone have any tips on coursing? If there is anyone that is a current business major doing a CS major, can I please get a chance to talk to you",

You can enter the degree you want and it'll give you the requirements, compute double-countings, help you find possible electives that meets departmental requirements etc. You would then be able to plan out each semester and see if you could fit all the requirements in. This can be particularly helpful when you want to double major/minor. Do keep in mind though that course offerings on stellic is not as accurate as possible, so use it but always refer to CMU course catalog. Also stellic will be slow at times, so have some patience. Nevertheless, it is still (among one of) your best friends if you want to do anything outside your major.",

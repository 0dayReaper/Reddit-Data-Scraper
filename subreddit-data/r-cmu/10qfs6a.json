    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the CMU School  of Architecture. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past.  You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.\n\nDuring the fourth year there is an award competition for architecture students meeting the minimum grade requirements. It is considered the ultimate answer to any rivalry between colleagues. As you might expect, the typical golden students running everything else will likely dominate the field and their leader may win outright overall; but I still recall the year when a famous Iraqi architect and noted role model for aspiring women architects everywhere may have won the competition essentially, despite never being a student here.\n\nDuring that year there was a certain gilded student with a penchant for digital modeling. He could wield any program and crank out photorealistic renders that were pure eye candy. Combined with the laser printer and 3d printing machines, he seemed to do hardly anything by hand, save the last step of gluing his model pieces together. His extreme talent and dedication to top notch quality final presentations were certainly admired by all; but, sometimes his creations seemed too familiar, though one could not always place where such things were seen before.\n\nSuch was the case with his winning submission for the Fourth Year Design Awards. It was a huge model with an industrial theme supported by amazing renders. He obviously worked hard to emulate the kind of drawings and images found in those expensive coffee table books about parametric-based architecture. The digitally produced model likewise looked clean and gave no hint of any imperfection by human hands. There was just something off about the project, something that screamed d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu far more than usual.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after the end of the semester when the in-house student crews started cleaning up studio that the answer became clear. One colleague hired for the summer interrupted the winner\u2019s annoying gloating by pointing out one of Zaha Hadid\u2019s real life gallery projects looked quite similar, right down to the particular bend in the curved corridor, aesthetic, and sleek form, though it was all utilized for a different programmatic purpose. With raised eyebrows, the winner stopped, sheepishly grinned, and then acknowledge his so-called \u201csource of inspiration\u201d before hastily leaving with his model and presentation for a summer\u2019s traveling paid for by the top prize. Surely no one else would realize the origin of his \u201coriginality,\u201d right?\n\nProbably not. Every fourth year student with a basic knowledge of rockstar architects knew the source of the inspiration but no one actually cared to contest the results of the competition. Some that were pressured to compete actually did not want to win, lest they be obligated as winners to travel all summer in the name of school research. No, the results were never challenged despite the hushed conversations between colleagues about the similarities. Regardless of how much was intentionally borrowed or not, you could say, in a way, that Hadid indeed once won in spirit, or at least in aesthetics, the most prestigious award in Soarch, depending on how you look at it. Of course, the bigger mystery to those fourth years was wondering where the great Hadid would have traveled with all that the prize money. I\u2019d wager Japan.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d",

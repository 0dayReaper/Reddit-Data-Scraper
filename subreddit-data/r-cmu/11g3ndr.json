    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am from India. I have around five years of work experience. I have an admission from CMU MISM 12-month program.\n\nIs the 100k USD spent worth it? How is the coursework really, and what are the career opportunities post this degree? Should I take up an MS in CS at another low-ranked university? I'm just skeptical that this coursework here will not be enough to make me job ready. And the bigger problem is that it is not a pure MS CS degree or an MBA program.\n\nAnd there are a lot of reviews giving it a lot of flak online. Looking at the current job market, it feels risky to opt into it since I have to prepare for jobs from December itself.\n\nI primarily want to know from people who have already completed it previously. Other as well, feel free to tell me your honest opinion. These will help me make an informed decision",

I would say that a CS is a better skill set for early-ish tech role than than the MISM. I think most senior leader do better have a solid technical foundation and learn the higher level management or program development stuff later. You can take your CS degree and then supplement with some exec training such as their CIO or CISO programs, which I have also done. \n\nTo me, the only thing with the 100k is the brand, connections, and being on campus learning with some top tier minds. Just don\u2019t go into huge debt or financially strain yourself.\n\nGood luck.",

I'd say there's also a lot of internal networking and projects with real-world tech clients. Career services tries hard, and there's a mentor program. The college is SUPER focused on getting you a job after you graduate. You can also look at the statistics of past graduating cohorts to see where they ended up and how much they got paid if that helps you decide. I know lots of people who took extra CS classes in the CS school to help with career development,  too.",

Graduated many years ago in a stronger job market, but most people landed good gigs. I'd recommend the 16mo program just because you have a better chance to align internships + the last semester have flexibility to specialize a little.\n\nIf you love being a SWE, and want to make your career as a SWE, I'd pick another program. I know plenty of MISMs who became SWEs at great companies, so it is definitely possible, but you'd probably emerge a stronger dev at a lower-ranked MSCS program.\n\nIf you are interested in something like analytics, product management, being a manager of SWEs someday, etc. then I think the MISM program has a lot of value. This is especially true if you feel you already have a strong technical base.\n\nIf you want to leave the hands-on tech behind, now, a MBA makes sense.",

What I have deduced is that the program by itself is not very great, yes it is with CMU but Heinz College doesn't have a great reputation. But if you have the skills, you can learn in the program, and build yourself to get a good paying job. \n\nI think many would agree 100K isn't worth it for this program. But if you do not have other admits and do not want to sit through another admissions cycle. You can surely think about studying and be done in a year.",

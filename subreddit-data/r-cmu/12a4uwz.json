    "postText": "Hey! I'm planning to apply to CMU's Dietrich School as a StatML major, and as I'm reading through their course requirements, I see that they have a lot of blank spaces in their example schedules for people to take courses NOT related to the major to satisfy 360 units (see image). So I'm wondering, what are the courses not related to the major? For example, can I just take CS classes as it is in a separate school (SCS) completely? Thank you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: After diving deeper, I realized that there are Gen Eds from the Dietrich School itself, but even with those 114 units, it still doesn't satisfy the 360 units in total, so what do I do with the remaining missing units?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/dietrichcollegeofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/departmentofstatistics/#statsmltextcontainer](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/dietrichcollegeofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/departmentofstatistics/#statsmltextcontainer)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ncyz0l4nkkra1.png?width=1601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=097b817a10376e6521d57dd8acffa87e7085dd13",

    "postText": "Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the CMU School of Architecture. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past.  You might find these stories unbelievable, but  alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.\n\nHistory can be said to be a series of collisions between simultaneous discoveries and opportunities. About ten years ago, such a moment of impact occurred between music and technology. A certain Korean pop singer rose to prominence in the US with his one hit wonder that nobody understood any of the lyrics, save for the one word \u201cstyle.\u201d That wacky and catchy song reverberated within the rowdy halls of the architecture studio day and night that year. There was no escape for the kpop haters. Like Rebecca Black, Ylvis, or way back to Eiffel65, Psy had become an auditory menace empowered by every smart phone that played his music. \n\nConcurrent with the prevalent rise of smart phones was the development of equally smart televisions. Being a premiere school of technology, the university was quick to jump on them and install them in diverse places. Some departments were more stringent in securing them with unique pass codes than others. RAs were, by far, the least concerned about these new television screens being installed in the dorms.\n\nI don\u2019t know which archie living on campus was the first to discover he could broadcast from his smartphone to the new smart TVs but I can say it was not a daytime discovery for his victims. In the wee hours of one fateful night, a television in some dorm on campus succeeded in waking up nearly an entire floor by blaring the music video at full volume for all to hear.\n\nFor a few weeks, news of the prank was shared among other archies and it was consequently repeated at random with other dorms. Each night brought similar results of people leaping out of bed or awaking with full panic attacks. Eventually, RAs were forced to start securing the televisions against such antics, but this prank remained the subject of gossip for the rest of the year.\n\nI guess with how often history is riddled with humorous collisions of technology and pop culture (such as switched URLs and Rick Astley), it\u2019s only natural that pranksters are the first opportunists to adapt their tactics to new possibilities.\n\nCheers,\n\nThe SoArch Tattler.\n\n\u201cVeritas Ex Cinere\u201d",

            "comment": "honestly most of the people i talk to day to day are people i met irl, but maybe that's just me... i definitely recommend joining clubs, though! there are plenty of low-key ones, where you can just go and hang out with people, possibly doing some other thing at the same time. not sure if you've been to the FAIR before, but i highly recommend you do this fall if you weren't planning on it already - you can get a really good sense of the vibe of a club from seeing how the people at the table interact with others (like literally if you're too shy to approach them yourself you can just watch others chat with them).\n\nyou can also just sign up for stuff that forces you to leave your room and interact with people. my favourite example of this is volunteering; you can generally expect people who volunteer for a cause to at least somewhat care about the cause (so you've already got a shared interest, yay) and be somewhat nice (nobody's forcing them to be there, they're there because they want to) and hopefully friendly. PACE has Service Saturdays, which usually take you off campus on a Saturday morning to go volunteer somewhere; there was an animal rescue one last weekend that it sounds like you might've liked, and there are others later this month, too ([linky link to their events](https://tartanconnect.cmu.edu/feeds?type=club&amp;type_id=68568&amp;tab=events)). The CMU Pantry also accepts volunteers if you're worried about going too far off campus (I can't seem to find a good sign-up form, but you can try emailing them maybe at cmu-pantry@andrew.cmu.edu).",

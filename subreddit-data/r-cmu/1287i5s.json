I also struggled in a lot of core stats classes, and apparently stats classes at cmu are def a bit more advanced than other universities, since they start covering material that other places only cover in grad school I think? But yeah it's def a struggle, though I feel like it got a lot better once I started reaching out to profs and advisors and going to a lot more office hours (I literally plan my schedule around OH nowadays)",

It shows you\u2019re learning and growing, which is a good thing and the whole point of being in school! I think it also helps to have friends in your classes who are kind of where you are so you can do work and commiserate together. You got this!",

A prof I have this semester has this great philosophy that I think can be applied here as well. \"I want everyone to ask all their questions. If you have a question, chances are someone else does as well.\"",

    "postText": "Hello, this might be a weird questions. I don't attend CMU, but I am trying to take or at least follow the course 15 213 from CMU over the summer. I was wondering what's the best way to go over the material for this course since I don't attend CMU? I know there is a [website](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-f19/www/index.html) for it but I was wondering if someone who took the course can tell me the best way to go over the content of the course to get the most out of it? Thanks in advance.",

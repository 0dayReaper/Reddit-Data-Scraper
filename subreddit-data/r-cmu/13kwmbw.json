    "postText": "Sorry to be one of the million school comparison posts but I'd appreciate if some of you have insights that I don't know. (Cost difference is negligible at this point)\n\nI was accepted to cmu and umich for mechanical engineering and I'm trying to decide between the two. For cmu side of the comparison, I was wondering if cmu supports undergraduate projects / startups and if it had salaries and company outcomes that matches the increase in academic rigor and stress(?) over umich. \n\nI know that cmu tops computing and robotics fields but for mechanical engineering specifically, umich seems to be slightly more well known and I don't know if the slight difference should matter in terms of job prospect and stuff. I plan to pursue an additional major of Robotics or something alone the lines of computing and robotics on top of the mechanical engineering. How do companies value something like this and would doing so drastically add to my course-load?\n\nI also often hear that since cmu is a relatively smaller school, that the social life is not as active. I'm a big racing / car guy, and was wondering if cmu has an active automotive student org and stuff. Lastly, is registering for classes that don't start at 7:30 in the morning still competitive at your school? \n\nThank you for your time and insights in advance!",

Both programs are known super well around the field, so I ended up getting a summer internship very easily every single year (even summer after freshman year).\n\nIt\u2019s tough to double major, but definitely not undoable. You have to plan your schedule very well to be able to graduate in 4 years still but very possible.\n\nAnd noooo MechE at CMU is hella social. It\u2019s also 50/50 guys &amp; girls which is *awesome* and a big win for CMU vs Umich imo.",

This will be even more noticeable as a transfer student, when you don't have the freshman dorm experience by which to make friends.\n\nThe academic stress is certainly bad, but what makes it worse is that it's just an endless slog with very little to look forward to.  I got out of CMU a decade ago and to this day can remember how great it felt to leave.\n\nYour time in college is a big chunk of your life, not just a name on a paper.  If you want a smaller school that has both great academics and social scene, look into Duke, Tulane or Vanderbilt.",

Let me tell you: when two schools are even remotely close in ranking -- think two Ivies, two mid-to-high tier schools like CMU and Mich, or two lower-tiered schools, it won't matter for salary. To be honest, it might not matter regardless.\n\nIn terms of what companies value, almost none of it will matter once you have a year of project experience under your belt at your first job.\n\nThis part is just my opinion: You're going to have a much, much better student experience at UMich.",

Granted most of my friends aren't into drugs and alcohol, and would rather hang out with each other than go to bars, but you choose your social life either place.\n\nI also enjoy that I've always gotten into every class I wanted.",

            "comment": "People beat me to most things I was going to say, but CMU has been pouring a ton of resources into their entrepreneurship program in the past few years (see [here](https://www.cmu.edu/swartz-center-for-entrepreneurship/)) and the entrepreneurship community is extremely active if that's something you're interested in. Most of the startups seem to be somewhat techie/robotics/blockchain focused, so it sounds right up your alley. The Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Association has frequent, open-to-all events (speakers, panels, etc.) and Innovation Scholars is an excellent cohort program for those who want to be even more involved (application required during your sophomore year, it's a good idea to be involved with the UEA before this to be competitive).\n\nIn terms of course registration, hopefully an engineer will chime in with their experience, but I have had an absurdly easy time getting into the classes I want and need. There are significant course reservations for classes required for your major so you should never even be waitlisted for those. One thing to bear in mind is that, because we are a medium-sized school, some of the core engineering courses are only offered in the fall or spring (not both) and may only have one section, so this can limit your scheduling flexibility. However, if you really need to deviate from this schedule, I have heard of people fulfilling a core engineering requirement using cross registration at University of Pittsburgh right down the street (most people aren't super aware of [cross registration](https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/registration/cross/index.html) but it's a great resource). I would have some backups for electives in your first year, especially if you're registration time is later in the day, as freshmen have last-priority registration and this seems to be the only scenario where people run into trouble. That said, waitlists do move quite a bit (as courses release unused reservations, people decide to take fewer classes, etc.), so don't panic if you have a later registration time and need to add yourself to a couple waitlists.\n\nMost MechEs get involved with buggy and/or booth, which provides a lot of hands-on project experience. Someone else mentioned CMR which is also big and there's a ton of robotics teams and projects. Plus all the engineering/robotics research. UMich will obviously have more such teams and labs due to their larger size, but idk what the process is like for actually getting on those teams or accessing those resources.\n\nOn the social side, you will likely find more school spirit at UMich, but you should have plenty of opportunities to make friends and hang out here too. Just make it a priority to meet new people, initiate activities, and say yes to things, especially in your first year. Events organized by the RAs can be helpful if you're a little more shy about this initially. I generally recommend the traditional style dorms (i.e. Donner, Stever, etc.) over the semi-suites and apartments for freshmen because they tend to be more social environments and make it easier to meet new people.\n\nBest of luck and congrats on two great choices :)",

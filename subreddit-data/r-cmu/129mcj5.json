Is this normal, or am I doing something wrong? Thank you.",

Log into HealthConnect through a private or incognito browsing window.\n2. Log into HealthConnect through another web browser altogether.\n3. Try logging into HealthConnect on another device, such as a smartphone, and disconnect from your home Wi-Fi.\n4. Try logging into your email using the following link: https://email.cmu.edu/\n4a. You can also try logging into SIO, Housing Portal, etc. but email is usually a good litmus test as to whether there is an issue with your account.\n5. If steps 1-3 failed but you could log into your email, reach out to University Health Services (UHS) ASAP and let them know you tried all of the steps above, and that you can log into your email and other CMU services without issue. Their email is health [at] andrew.cmu.edu.",

    "postText": "Hi! I am a DC first year currently taking 66-136. I don\u2019t wish to stick with this course, because I rarely get an A in any literature and art class and 66-136 is a combination of both. I bet some of you may dislike your current seminar lol.\n\nSadly, no one can switch between Seminars easily. I talked to my advisor and he told me that if I can find a person taking 66-137,139,140 wishing to switch to 66-136, then we can both get what we want. \n\nIf any of you interests in 66-136(Maybe you love the course material or have a bunch of friends taking the course) or just hate your current seminar, please let me know!",

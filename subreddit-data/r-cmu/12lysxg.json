Would be nice if people knew better whether the \"no painting twice in one night\" rule was invented by the Instagram account two years ago, or whether there's any precedent for this. It also leaves clear room to disagree over whether the Fence Insta is the official authority on Fence rules.\n\nIn my time here, I know there's been at least one other incident of the Fence getting painted twice in one night. This is the only time anyone has tried to assert that painting the Fence twice in one night constitutes vandalism. Evidently, people seem to have a valid, relevant disagreement about Fence rules",

Usually the Fence is pretty self-regulating, though, so this authority is not exercised, but in this case, they will probably be reaching out to the affected organizations/students to discuss next steps, and are in contact with the Fence instagram account to clarify that this \"rule 5\" is historically not actually a rule.\n\nIn this case, the only real claim to vandalism that I can see is if the Fence was painted by pouring paint buckets over top of the fence, as this has historically been prohibited (hand painting/brushes only). The original person seems to imply that this occurred, and this claim will be investigated.",

It's not easy being the only one of my kind, especially when it comes to dealing with the ongoing conflict in Israel and Palestine.  \nRecently, my friends and I wanted to paint a fence to raise awareness about the situation in Jerusalem. We were trying to peacefully express ourselves, but as you can see in the photos, our efforts were met with vandalism.  \nI get it, people have their own opinions on the conflict, but it's not fair to be treated this way just for speaking up. The Arab Student Association and I followed all the rules, but we were still targeted.  \nI don't know what I expect from posting this, but I hope it helps others understand what it's like to walk in my shoes. It's tough out here, but I'm not giving up on expressing my voice and standing up for my people.",

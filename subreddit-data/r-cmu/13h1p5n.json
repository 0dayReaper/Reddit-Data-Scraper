I also played a lot of video games. Granted there were 2 times during the semester where I just did work continuously but it was only a couple days. You should be fine",

The semesters where I overloaded were not so good...\n\nAs you noted, it all boils down to time management. That's not as hard as it might sound, though. Two hours between classes? Start some problem sets. Find a group of friends in your classes or a study group to help keep you accountable and check your work against.\n\nThere are plenty of more formal resources available as well. Use office hours and academic development for support! I used to be an \"academic counselor\" teaching study skills and time management. Feel free to DM me with questions.\n\nTbh, real life requires time management. No better time than now to learn.",

There is an overworking culture in this school, but you don\u2019t need to be part of it. I found myself learning and retaining much better when I kept my course load below 54 units. I also had plenty of time to participate in extracurriculars.",

The problem is there are too many options outside of class and that leads to sleep limitations for some people, but that's by choice.",

Of course taking technical classes will be tough, but you won\u2019t be drowning in school work. After freshmen year, I\u2019ve had all my Friday\u2019s off (no classes). The professors are understanding of student\u2019s lives and will give extensions or curve a test if they understand that they made it too hard. \n\nI\u2019ve had a better sleep schedule in college than in high school. You have to become better at time management and using your resources. I was bad at it but you\u2019re kinda forced to be better at time management in any school you go to.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I got waitlisted but CMU is still my top choice. I was wondering if anyone who has some insight or successfully made it off the waitlist could give me some advice on how to go about the \"Waiting List Update Form.\"\n\nShould I strictly answer with an update of my current activities, or should I also use it as an opportunity to demonstrate interest and fit (so it would be more like an LOCI).\n\nThe prompt is, \"*What additional information or updates would you like Carnegie Mellon to consider? (300 words maximum).*\"",

I think even the class schedules are staggered. \n\nSo if you're a woman you get a lot of opportunity, that's where the saying \"the odds are good but the goods are odd\" comes from. If you're a man, well there are plenty of other colleges near CMU. I recommend doing homework somewhere near Point Park, they like CMU guys.",

Trust but verify. \n\nFrom first hand experience I highly doubt the female population at CMU has doubled since I went there. They may have stopped separating the art and engineering students but I doubt it. They've never been known as a school that values their students' happiness or social lives, it's all about academia there.",

It's really built for students that are geared solely towards academia. That being said, if there are more women there now then the problem might fix itself.",

I'm moving to Pittsburgh for an internship in early June and I'm looking for housing for the summer continuing through the upcoming schoolyear. If you're in a similar situation and looking for roommates, send me a message (2Br is a lot cheaper than 1 Br). I'm currently looking at apartments in Shadyside &amp; Squirrel Hill and I have a spreadsheet of potential places already mapped out.\n\nSome info about (living with) me:\n\nI like to cook and I am happy to cook for more than 1 person\n\nI generally keep my spaces and common spaces pretty clean, but I won't bug you about your personal spaces haha\n\nI'll be studying CS and I'm generally a huge nerd (D&amp;D, Rubik's cubes, etc.)",

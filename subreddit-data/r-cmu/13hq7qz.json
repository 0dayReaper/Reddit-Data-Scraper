Does anyone have any thoughts on what the best meal plan would be? I want to eat 3 meals a day, preferably using as few flexible dollars as possible, and I won't eat anywhere off campus.",

Also likely that people will want to explore the food off campus (Craig street is a 5 min walk). Additionally, red gives the most dining dollars, which you could spend on food. Blocks aren't worth it for breakfast. This is a few years out of date, but it used to be that breakfast block is worth around $6.50, while a block costs around $10\n\nAnother thing is that most students don't eat breakfast, but that could be different for you.",

I am a junior, and have mentored two sets of freshman now, most of the time red is more than enough. Athlete's that have like 5 meals a day need a bit more sometimes, but apart from that everyone I know who get more blocks just ends up loosing them.",

Flex dollars can be spent on whatever you want at dining locations both on and off campus. In freshman year, I would use blocks whenever I could, but considering free food events, off-campus trips with clubs/friends, and the fact that sometimes what I wanted to eat was not offered on blocks (so I had to spend flex), I ended up with a bunch of blocks wasted at the end of the semester, even though I had the plan with the fewest blocks.\n\nFor this reason, people generally strongly recommend that you go with the plan with the most flex dollars.",

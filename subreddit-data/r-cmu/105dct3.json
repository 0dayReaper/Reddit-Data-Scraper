This [website](https://www.cmu.edu/admission/admission/college-of-fine-arts-applicants) says 10-20 pieces, but this [one](http://www.art.cmu.edu/undergraduate/portfolio-apply/) says 12-20. Can anyone confirm because then I need to make 2 more before Monday. Thanks!",

Yours might already be answered!\n\nPlease consider posting to subs like /r/pittsburgh for general life in Pittsburgh questions, dedicated subs like /r/chanceme, /r/ApplyingToCollege, and /r/collegeresults for odds of getting accepted, and using the search in the sidebar.\n\n^(If I've misidentified your post, please ignore this message and instead take it as a reminder to contribute your own answers to the megathread.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The faculty, mainly James Duesing, Suzie Silver and Scott Andrews, are nothing more than a mob of bullies who enjoy demeaning and harming their students. I cannot stress enough how toxic and harmful the faculty are. Going there was the single most damaging mistake I made in my life. It has haunted me for years and really ruined my career. Please don\u2019t go",

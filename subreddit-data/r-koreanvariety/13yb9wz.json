            "comment": "I cannot stand the way Jin Hyeong played, he's slimy, dirty, selfish and too greedy for his own good. If it worked somehow i don't mind, but everything he's done so far was sabotaging his own teammates after getting benefits from them or he thought he could win on his own. It's so illogical and absurd most of the time too i can't even understand his behaviors and why people kept believing in him, not only did it mess the whole team up, he also didn't win every time after betraying them. What's the point?\n\nAnd I know for sure the reason &gt;!he picked Pi instead of Dex!&lt; was simply because he could beat them. Such a coward. He needs to go, soon.\n\nThe Outdoor Alliance split up was expected but i'm glad &gt;!no one was eliminated!&lt;. And it was pretty nice to see Dex and especially Hyun Ji got more involvement in the games instead of staying behind Jin Ho and Xitsuh.\n\nJin Ho's plays and attitude always amaze me, i hope he wins it all.\n\n&gt;!All Outdoor alliance members' final would be lit.!&lt;",

He's easily the most courteous person on the cast. Love how he doesn't get his hands dirty and does his best to save everyone on his team. I'm rooting for both Jinho and Xitsuh to win and I honestly wish I could see these two together again in a different show after BG2",

I\u2019m obviously a big fan of Jinho but let\u2019s be real, if you aren\u2019t that smart you cannot afford to be that fair/courteous. So I don\u2019t really blame the other casts that do shady shits and blame others since they\u2019re lacking the skills to save themselves with minimal lobbying. Though it\u2019s nothing to be proud of and Jinhyeong is just digging his grave everytime he open his mouth. Like, even when he talks about the game, it\u2019s just explaining how the game works, like ???",

Rather than constantly lying (Jinhyeong) or screaming &amp; hollering like a lunatic (Seungjin). Dex plays in an honorable way as well. I would say he's almost \"too\" loyal. He even &gt;!sacrificed himself for others!&lt; at the end of season 1 and I wouldn't be shocked if he does it again.\n\nEither way, there technically isn't a wrong way to play. They're allowed to play in any fashion they want. Everyone made it to the semifinals one way or another. It just shows what type of character and person they are in these circumstances.\n\nIf the apocalypse were to happen, I know Dex would be my side. Where as Jinhyeong, I don't even want to imagine what he would do. He would probably sell me as a slave to make a couple coins. LOL.\n\nReal talk, I'm going to try not judge them outside of the show. I'm hoping they're all decent people. In the end, it's a game show.",

He could've just said he wanted an easier opponent, not necessarily out in the open like Xitsuh did, but at least in the interview and that's totally fair. But he kept spouting bs about he and Pi cannot exist at the same time anymore blah blah, she needs to go so he can fly blah blah.\n\nHe did the same with Mina too after the Math game, he was confident to win, messed up, cried and blamed her for not involving enough in the game, and then tried to gaslight her and other people into thinking his decision was fair and not because he was trying to save himself.\n\nIn these kind of shows betrayals and tricks are fine, but his cowardly and slimy nature stood out too much that it left a horrible taste in my mouth. He could just be more honest with himself and take responsibilities instead of lying his way out to avoid being the bad guy when he was literally the bad guy himself.",

Pi who was the absolute worst contestant had a reason to stick with him to some extent just because he clearly fancied her, but even with that he still Of Mice and Menned her and shot her in the back of the head while telling her it was for her own good. there is not a single redeemable or trustable feature about this guy",

The way we gets so riled up over the smallest things is a talent and the way he talked his head off at Hyunji to get $10,000 was a sight to see. I was laughing the whole time. I agree with his statement that Hyunji got a free ride and then tried cutting him and Jinho off. However when it comes to a free ride this sediment doesn\u2019t really apply to Dex. Dex because he was seen as the team\u2019s weakest link has been selected to play in the deathmatch time and time again and has played in the deathmatch numerous times. Dex has made sacrifices too but what has Hyunji sacrificed?? \nI was started to gain a bit of respect for Jinhyeong bc of his loyalty to Pi but that went out the window by the end of episode 12. He\u2019s just grimy and his explanation for &gt;!Picking Pi in the death match!&lt; just made me feel sad for the girl. \nDex Hyunji and Pi were actually a very good team and worked really well together. I was glad to see how they got more involved in the games after splitting up from their original alliances. It made me respect them a bit more.",

He's part of some iconic performances and early SMTM is pretty much the peak of the series.\n\njust some cool info: on season 4, he was a really hot topic on the korean net because during a cypher mission where the rappers have to snatch the mic to get a chance to perform, he actually took it and gave it to a 17 year old who was too timid to take it for himself. xitsuh basically gave up his chance to help the kid out in a super competitive environment, was super memorable. also snoop dogg was a guest judge for that stage LOL",

On top of that, Jinho and Xitsuh are the ones using their money/resources to help the others in DM votes and such. In the last episode with Dex coming last, that was basically just a result of misfortune with Dex getting no points throughout the game. \n\n&gt;if you make someone come first as a team you have to make EVERYONE come joint first or you achieve nothing for the team. ironically dex is the only one who might have wrangled this with his \"let's pick the same cube\" plan\n\nDex's plan wouldn't have even gotten them a joint win, they just all would've gained the same points from then on, and whoever had more initially would be the sole winner lmao.\n\nYou can point at the 2 immunities Xitsuh has gotten, but I think you're massively underestimating how much those two have contributed to their team's success compared to the others.",

I think if they've been allowed that freedom and yet people are still choosing them over traitorous and weak people like Pi, that has to at least put some blame on those two for not taking the chance to build social capital.\n\nAnd even in that case where they were being actively threatened and at highest risk of being in danger, Jinho stepped up and threw himself in to protect them. Outside of that episode, Dex and Hyunji had plenty of opportunity to decrease their risk through their social game.\n\n&gt;he went to the deathmatch for his team more than anyone\n\nTo be clear, he only chose to do it once, he didn't have any choice in E10, so he wasn't making a sacrifice, he was just put in danger through bad luck and survived.",

Jinho sets a pretty good example on how to build rapport with people despite being on opposite sides in games. The team wasn't upset that Jinhyeong was talking to them, they were upset because he was making unnecessarily strategical mindgames. If he was just making small talk and being sociable, they wouldn't have cared. \n\nI'm not saying they didn't make any sacrifices, but their position is totally salvageable thanks to Jinho and Xitsuh carrying their team's strategy and tanking virtually all the aggression from their opponents.",

Honestly, the way xitsuh blatantly discredit the other two (when Dex primarily) didn't actually directly benefit from it is kinda too arrogant and a bit off putting. Xitsuh keeps labeling them free riders when it's his plan that didn't work last ep 9 10 and even suddenly placed Dex in last. Even when the wild team wins from their plan, it's not Dex and Hyunji that benefited and they both keep getting picked for DM. In fact getting sent to isolation might actually be better because they at least have a chance to win exemption and also buy/steal vote for half the price. \n\nThe suggestion to split even comes from Jinho but even when they're suddenly placed in a situation where it's 3 vs 4, none of them placed last and one of the 3 actually wins first. I'm so happy the Dex-Hyunji-Pi trio actually find their balance and comfort and actually consider and give free rein to each other to decide, while still cooperating. It's evident by how each of the three was also happy and satisfied with the team.\n\nJinho did take one for Hyunji for the  DM tho. He's almost too kind from what I've seen. He's probably my favourite in the show considering his ability and also character aside from my bias.\n\nNot that I dislike Xitsuh, I still like him but his freerider remark did leave a bit of a bitter taste at the time. Still rooting for any of the wild team members to win. I'll be happy if the winner is any one of them.",

But glad to see Dex &amp; Hyunji can stand on their own. I find it better that the team develops like this or else it'll be boring\n\nOther thoughts on the ep\n\n\\- Happy that YunB is out, he is narcissistic and that kinda killed himself because he couldn't accept being picked (or that confessional is just an excuse and he just sucked so badly at the game lol)\n\n\\- Jinhyeong play style just feel awkward to me. Like he doesn't really now how to place himself and how to do social game. But must admit he is quite strong on individual games. That giving \"20\" points for YunB feels to be a bad move tho, he is lucky the opponent is YunB who is bad at the game or else thats a waste of 20 points.\n\n\\- I can't believe how insignificant shadow players appearance in ep 12.\n\n\\- I realized so far Jinho had used almost half of his money to save Dex &amp; Hyunji (when he had initially told Chulgoo using 10k in a game feel like a waste). He must felt the responsibility as the big bro/leader for them. Although I don't see that as necessary since this is survival game after all, but well that's Jinho I guess.   \nAlso Love him for lecturing Jinhyeong for almost revealed their plan on the spot. He didn't wait and only say things on confessional interview later.\n\nAnyway if jungle team all manage to reach final. They really conquered the mansion in a sense lol. I meant its 9 mansion team vs 5 OG jungle team (i don't count YunB since he works with pool alliance more) and 4 jungle team managed to survive till they become the majority as 4 vs 1.

            "comment": "This week and last weeks episodes are pretty boring in gameplay. The only interesting thing is we get to see more Yurisa Yeah!!! (lmao)\n\nAnyway, it must be suck for Pi for almost winning first place but lose because Phantom players decided to help Jinho-Xitsuh instead. (If you look at it closely, Yurisa could even win the game with 31 points if she bet the block in 10 points zone too but she didn\u2019t.) then she got chosen by her very own alliance with the lamest excuse I have ever seen. Come on Jinhyung!!!, just admit you chose her because she was an easy target. Why in the hell you want to lose your only alliance in the Final 5? 2 Vs 3 is absolutely better than 1 Vs 4. (And with you being so even more untrustworthy in these past 2 episodes, good luck finding anyone willing to work with you.) Who cares that no one want to work with you if you and Pi are still together. It\u2019s Final 5 not Final 10!!!\n\nIt\u2019s great to see Hyunji-Dex being independent to Jinho-Xitsuh. They may not play it as perfect as Jinho-Xitsuh but they stood their own ground and got a pretty good result. (Hyunji won Ep.11 and both escaped last place in Ep.12.) Also don\u2019t understand the fuss about them going behind Jinho-Xitsuh back and target them. Didn\u2019t most of you here pinpoint them as a free rider? This week, they had done just that but some of you are still mad at them? Come on!!! It\u2019s a survival game.\n\nAnyway, next week is the last week. I don\u2019t mind any of the outdoor team to win it all in the end. (So Mr.Lee Jin Hyung\u2026*please leave*)\n\nWe could see Phantom players in both Semifinal and Final, could be very interesting\u2026",

These games had to have been planned *ages* in advance.\n\nAnd they've already had multiple games that have clearly disadvantaged Jinho (one that involved full-on running, two that could totally depend on someone's ability to speed past people to stand in line), so they're not afraid of that. S1 had tremendously shit game design, so this repetition is almost certainly just the PD's inadequacies seeping through.",

Gotta wonder what would have happened if she played liked this before.\n\n* I'm surprised no one before Jinho thought about ending the round by pushing the clock before specially since this was a valid tactic in day and night. Dex spent 12 coins just to get 8 points while jinho earned 25 with fewer coins lol.\n\n* When the game made it clear that the phantom team had to choose between helping Jinho or Pi in the clutch round I knew immediately they're gonna help Jinho instead. Dude just has charisma as opposed to Pi's team that's full of toxicity. I also think Yurisa's a lowkey Jinho fangirl.\n\n* Kind of interesting that there was no interview about why jinhyeong picked pi, pi said it's caused they fought but there was no replay. But it kinda made sense when Jinyeong finally said the reason why.\n\nThis was a refreshing episode. It's nice to see all those karmas going around. Jinho winning because of positive karma, jinhyeoung getting last and Pi getting chosen because of negative karma, and also HyunJin' failed backstabbing almost had her eliminated(i believe she's the weakest deathmatch player there)",

After episode 6 (or whatever episode it was that they all live in the mansion again) I found my retention dropping on main matches and I start doing something else or on my phone! PD needs to start mixing games up with a combination of physical and mental games or puzzles (physical to the point that players move around not like physical 100). Almost all the recent games favor a majority.  The death matches have been okay so far. In the future, I hope to see a game where a single person can win out of luck or skill even against a majority those kinds of games.\n\nAs much as I love the settings, twists, people (I love the casts! just not how things panned out), and new mechanics I feel like Season 1 had a better trajectory and more organic feels and connections AND BETRAYALS. This season felt like everyone knows it is just a game and was just there to promote themselves, maybe because like Jinhyeong said, he's the only non-celebrity or YouTuber left? \n\nThey were right when they were promoting episodes 3 and 4 that that was peak excitement.\n\nAlso how is Yurisa so pretty?",

            "comment": "A few thoughts on these episodes.\n\n1. This is the duration of time/amount of content per episode that we needed last week. I'm still salty about them wasting two episodes on that garbage and making them so short as well. We have two episodes left and four people to eliminate to get a winner, and they're almost certainly going to rush that.\n2. YunB went full Karen. I wasn't expecting that. The whole \"I need a justification to face Jinhyeong\" thing he did was dumb. After he was picked, he didn't get a say in whether he'd go to the deathmatch or not. Him acting like he needed a reason for that beyond the fact that he was picked... kind of ridiculous. Then, forfeiting the deathmatch because he was angry was crazy. I'm surprised and glad that he was eliminated.\n3. I don't understand Jinhyeong, both on a game and a social level. Backstabbing can be good, but the way he goes about it/interacts with people while doing it/unnecessarily complicating things makes him the irritating kind of antagonistic character. \n4. Pi, Hyunji, and Dex were fun together. I wish they would have played together on the second episode, too.\n5. Like others have said, the phantom players were useless. I feel like they picked Yurisa to go again rather than having Seungjin or Mina go for the first time was because they wanted the chaos Yurisa could deliver, and that was very much lacking.\n6. The Xitsuh/Hyunji vote thing was weird. I didn't understand that interaction and problem, so it was frustrating to watch. Just give him the damn money.\n7. I don't get the outdoor crew civil war from episode 11. If they were going to go back to a team of four for that game, I don't get why Jinho/Xitsuh would pick working with someone as shady as Jinhyeong and someone they had problems with like YunB. These people are so weird to me.\n\nI'm glad the outdoor people made it to the final five. These two episodes took a really roundabout and awkward way to get there, but it still happened. If we can get rid of Jinhyeong, I won't really care who wins.",

I don\u2019t blame her since that\u2019s the best she could do.\n\nThough if I was Jinhyung I\u2019d have honored the alliance I shared with Hyunji for that short period of time since its rather beneficial to keep that so that they can work together again if the situation allows so, rather than having told Jinho x Xitsuh. But Jinhyung is very bad at strategizing so\u2026",

            "comment": "General thoughts:\n\nProbably unpopular opinion but I thought Jinhyeong was funny this week. The whole of episode 11 was \"wtf Jinhyeong\"???? But he did say he'll get rid of YunB and did it (alienating everyone else in the process, and I'm half convinved this was an excuse he made up in post-episode interviews). Episode 12 was still \"wtf Jinhyeong\" but I'd started to appreciate it by then. In Yurissa's absence, he's the batshit antisocial anti-alliance member with brains to not quit lol. Made death matches look easy and now he's the last non-jungle member remaining. What he said about being the only non-celebrity member to make it was interesting, maybe that's why he's so stressed all the time, he probably has a chip on his shoulder.\n\nThat one scene where Hyunji said she wanted to make it far by using others' brains...I was like girl, I could tell.\n\nEp 11:\n\nI disliked ep 11's money match because the black + white = grey mechanism and the random card allocation makes it super likely that the majority would always opt to playing in grey to maximise scoring and/or tanking potential. Seemed like a flawed game. The original white and black game was better, and I wish they had stuck to fixed number of each colour's cards this time and had a mechanism to motivate players to sometimes play white or black. If Jinhyeong hadn't gone rogue at the end they'd have played grey for all of the rounds. It ended up more luck-based than probably intended and relied too much on how many grey or grey-making cards each player got.\n\nDex and Hyunji did well striking out alone for the first time, with credit to them and Pi. The other alliance were outplayed. But to be honest I'm not fully convinced as this money match felt flawed.\n\nIn the death match I appreciated the replay of this game tbh because it was interesting to see different strategies come in. YunB alone is as sloppy as expected. I'll miss his politics lol.\n\nEp 12:\n\nNot in love with this game either! The introduction of phantom players makes it more tenuous and less based on the players' own merit. Then again as a social survival show, convincing them to help you is a part of strategy too I suppose. And Knucks and Yurissa aren't people who would roll over and let themselves be used as an easy winning strategy so it wasn't too bad.\n\nDex was quite naive for letting Pi take 17 points, Hyunji was correct about that. Jinho's 0 to 25 point jump was very nice to see, this game only had room for this strategy to be played out once or twice, and it was nice to see that he seized the opportunity.\n\nI did think that Yurissa would be willing to help Jinho a little because she seems to actively disrespect everyone else, but while in the dungeon many eps ago, she betted on Jinho's team to win because he has calm gameplay. That's the only non-negative thing she had to say about a person all season. But she also has too much pride to win the game for him or join any alliance, so he had to put himself in a winnable spot anyway.\n\nThe breakdown of the jungle alliance was so interesting, it got tense FAST. I don't think anyone was very wrong or right necessarily. It's a survival show. That scene where the 3 younger ones were discussing heatedly while Jinho was sitting with hie head on the table though lol. Poor dude, he is tired.\n\nLooking forward to the semis and final! This season has been great, hope the ending games are satisfying.",

She couldn't even be bothered to use her money to save the Jungle team even when she had the chance several times. Both Jinho and Xitsuh have cashed out to buy voting privileges when one of the Jungle member become DM contestants but what did she do? In a way, it serves her right for saving her money only to have it spread out to the other players and for getting the first negative reward from Pandora's box.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I did think that Yurissa would be willing to help Jinho a little because she seems to actively disrespect everyone else, but while in the dungeon many eps ago, she betted on Jinho's team to win because he has calm gameplay. \n\nJinho-Yurisa was such a pleasure to watch. I kept on repeating the part where Jinho was talking about strategy and Yurisa was just there agreeing. I like to think she was kind of starstruck about finally meeting the legend. I also love how she heartily laughed when Jinho mimicked how people would be rushing to the front of the line lol. Such cute interactions.",

However in this show the games seem to be more based on games of chance. The players try to mitigate the randomness with alliances but at the end if the day the loser is basically random. \n\n\nI don\u2019t think they are repeating games based on being lazy, I think its somewhat of a good idea because the hardest part of the genius is having to teach the viewers a new game every episode. I think its fine to have similar games especially because you give people a chance to use their experience to find new strategies or loopholes, like how the phantom player used his shoes to count cards. By the way, wtf is up with that phantom match, he put so much effort into winning that match, I thought for sure that would help him win a chance to get back onto the show like maybe he enters a 3 way deathmatch game and if he wins he goes back into the house and the other two are eliminated.\n\nI also thought that when Yurisa and Knucks joined the game that maybe the were told secretly that they could rejoin the house if they won the game. \n\nI really don\u2019t understand why they have all of these games for the phantom people to play where they seemingly have no reason to try and win other than their pride. I much preferred how in the genius the eliminated players just chose who to give buffs to, so it rewarded players that were nice, and most of the time the eliminated players didn\u2019t want to ruin the spirit of the game so they just distributed the buffs equally. I much preferred that because it let the eliminated players act like a commentary couch for the games as they watched.",

Make it so the time pauses when someone is making a bet instead of charging people money if they go over a minute. The reason why I think this change would have improved it is because as a minority group its almost impossible to win when the enemy can see you go into the room and know that you are making a move. They can easily guess your strategy, and it is costly/hard to try and fake something. I also think this punishes the people who play it safe. Idk if you noticed but players wasted a coin to check the time basically every time they placed a bet. So if you go in to do a fake and waste a coin, then the enemy just goes in after you to see if you changed the time, so both sides end up wasting a coin and you get nothing from the fake. \n\nI\u2019d much rather see everyone go in during every time break and decide whether they would spend a coin or not. I feel like there are more interesting plays a minority alliance can make when you are playing with mindgames and the enemy doesn\u2019t know which blocks you will spend money on. You also wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to check what time it is everytime someone goes in, otherwise you would run out of money to bet.",

I see no reason they can't add 1 bidding rule to something that they already played",

It's not like Jinho totally cut them off when he told Hyunji. He was actually very mindful of all parties involved and told her/them in a respectful manner. He opened the possibility of splitting the team if the games does not work in favor of a big team but then in ep11, XS was still willing to work with them and had actually moved closer to Dex to start discussing the game only for Dex to go to the other side and work with Pi. And then when Yunbi took advantage of the situation. Idk man the fallout felt so feeble? I actually sympathize with XS because both HJ and Dex felt ungrateful and he did his best to not have one of them be the DM candidate but sometimes you just can't do that.",

If you think about it, it was also the consequence of Dex's actions biting him back. Both him and XS were always at the last place in Day&amp;Night, and with the gambling he did (spent 13 coins to give Jinheong and Jinho 2 points when he should have used it to bet on his time and earn some points for himself), and then eventually ending up bankrupt and having to push XS to make a decision to save him. It's XS fault for not minding his own score but when faced with an option between Dex or himself getting last place, ofc XS is gonna save himself.\n\nIt personally annoyed me when he hung on to that anger and carried it to the next game where XS extended his hand because it was a majority game but Dex left and formed a team with Pi. And when Yunbi joined JH-XS, he was all '*can I use physical force?*' / '*you're making me angry*'. It was unsightly. \n\nEp 9-10 Jinho, who thought they wasted their coins and got a bit mad with their decisions, had already let it go in the same episode (bless his big heart) and even spent 19 coins for HJ to score 2 points. Because really, what else can be done, aside from try to save every one from being the last place and if the last place happens to be you, then just accept it?",

There is nothing going on between us\"\n\nXitsuh shows himself so smart this episode and Jinhyeong looks so clumsy with his betrayals. \n\nSatisfying to see Pi, Dex and Hyunji mopping the floor with team made up of \"brains\". Jinho and his disunited team kept outsmarting themselves.\n\nEp 12\n\nIt seems like real Hyunji was finally unleashed. She is so betrayal happy.\n\nPi was very smart using her reputation to claim she bid a lot on the most precious time period and then only spending 1 coin.\n\nPhantom players didn't do much in the main game?..\n\nWhy didn't they show what the argument between Pi and Jinhyeong was? Did he finally got over her.\n\nElimination candidate arguments got old with Xitsuh fuming over slights towards him from days ago and demanding money from both of them.\n\nDeathmatch variant of Ascending Numbers is a much better game because of the strategy of picking and giving the other player 2nd number. It works much better as information war when played with 2 players.",

Jinho is really a nice guy like smart , mature, calm but sweet . Dex is such a loyal guy i really like his nature of not being greedy and enjoying whatever time he has ik he is not super smart or good at brainy games but he still gives it his all and the best part is i may feel really safe playing with him because i would know that he has my back. Xitshu is such a character like i hated him in first episode because of his speech but then he went to jungle team got attention from them , became happy and showed his smartness throughout the game his only one flaw is his impulsive nature and not thinking from others perspective but i am sure he is a really fun guy . Hyunjin i know she has never shown her full potential but i would say she always had the will to contribute in whatever way she can , she took the jungle experience  positively and from past couple of episodes it shows that she wants to do something of her own her one flaw is that she comes across a little immature or ungrateful to xitshu at times maybe she is not very good at understanding situations . Pi is fun i like how she is always doing something and getting close to winning but then makes a stupid silly move and losses but still try it again . Jinyeoung is really rash it shows that he is super anxious guy but i believe he will learn from experience how to balance his smartness and nature to come across socially balanced guy in future. Yunb is smart with speed strategy but a little to judgmental still is very entertaining to watch and the level of confidence he possesses is mind-blowing .\n\nAll in all very different personalities , and I don't really hate even a single one of them",

Also disappointed about the lack of variety in the 1v1 games.\n\nE11\n\nWe finally find out what happens when the Phantom Player wins... \\*drumroll\\*... and it's &gt;!nothing, other than the loser not earning the vote exemption card!&lt;.\n\nI loled when Pi mentioned&gt;! this was the first time she had so much fun being on a team. No shit.. turns out having teammates you can rely on and not backstab you, is actually good.!&lt;\n\nNo idea what Jinhyeong is doing. &gt;!What's the purpose of being on a team, if you're just going to betray them at a moment's notice (he should at least wait until his own survival is secured first). His antics make him untrustworthy, deceitful and manipulative. My feeling is, unlike the rest of the cast, he has no outstanding reputation on the line, so he doesn't give a fu\\*k if the audience will hate him. In the end there can be only one winner and he's only looking out for himself.!&lt;\n\nJinho is building himself to be the most likeable person ever. I can't think of any other contestant who would &gt;!vote for a candidate and then give money to the same candidate so they can buy an additional vote to counter his vote.!&lt;\n\nI guess there is &gt;!no more power to exile a player to the jungle.!&lt; What's up with these sudden rule changes? The dungeon concept is abandoned. The part where a team lives in the outdoors is forgotten and now this? I know the show's premise is it supposed to be an illogical and unfair game, but this is ridiculous.\n\nE12\n\nDisappointed about the&gt;! guest Phantom Players. In the interviews, they talk smack how they are going to disrupt the main match, but then they end up listening to Jinho. Not related to the game, but holy shit does Yurisa have good style. Her makeup and outfit matches so well with Knucks that they look like a couple.!&lt;\n\nJinhyeong and Pi continue to be very unlikable. Pi &gt;!reveals her true colors and is not ashamed to backstab Jinhyeong so she can win. I'm not falling for her crocodile tears or her bowing at the end.!&lt;\n\nOther thoughts:  \nHyunji &gt;!has been hard carried in this show. She was able to bank a ridiculous amount of money (before it was redistributed) since she didn't have to spend any of it. The remaining contestants had to go through deathmatches (Dex x2, Jinho x1, Jinhyeong x2) or exiled to the Jungle (Jinhyeong x1, Xitsuh x1). Frankly,  I will be very surprised if she doesn't get eliminated in the semi-finals.!&lt;\n\nGlad that the &gt;!core 4 Jungle team members made it to semi-finals. They had such good synergy together, reminds me of the JJJ alliance in Time Hotel. As long as any of these four win, I'll be happy.!&lt;",

Why did Pi last week go tell Xitsuh the times, angering YunB? Why does Jinhyeong just go to the opposite team to tell them to put two cards max which threw the game for his team? Am I missing something or are they socially stunted? \n\nI think betrayal is good and needed for these survival shows. But some of these bozos have nothing to gain and just open their mouths only to lose... this makes Jinho so much easier to root for. He doesn't speak as much as others, but when he does it's always nice to listen to.",

I feel like the location is also being wasted since they are just mostly indoors playing with blocks, cards, and a tv. Ever since the dramatic and weirdo characters have been kicked off, it has been pretty boring. \n\nI will laugh my ass off if Hyun Ji casually gets to the final and possibly wins without ever playing in an elimination game while just getting carried.\n\nI love Yurisa.

It's not like they're completely lazing around when Jinho/Xitsuh is planning, they observe the other teams, keep tabs on their motion, share information and sometimes spend money as necessary and they never betray their team and strategy.\n\nThey technically even become like a meat shield for Xitsuh even, cooperating and shielding him, putting him in a safe position (first place) when the indoor team are openly targeting him, all while they never win first and directly benefit from their plan with how they keep getting chosen as DM target because they look easy and are in complete alliance with Jinho/Xitsuh.\n\nFunny how when Dex and Hyunji are loyal and protect them during game, it's only natural and expected of them, but when Jinho and Xitsuh do the same for them it's supposed to be treated like a favor. That's why i like Dex remarks to Xitsuh, he said that he didn't understand what a teamplay is. Dex-Hyunji dynamic in their next alliance with Pi proves that, his leadership style is more inclusive and gives highlights and options to the members while still striving to win.\n\nXitsuh takes their cooperation and loyalty for granted tbh. I wonder how he feels when he calls them free riders, and immediately after the split he teams up with players that are 'capable' but full of self interest and betrayal (Jinyeong).",

Jinho, Xitsuh and Dex are the type that values loyalty and trust. So Jinho/Xitsuh feels betrayed when Hyunji makes a deal behind their back, and it's even to eliminate one of the two when they both have worked hard for the team. That's why Xitsuh said all the free rider comments, it's out of anger and betrayal. \n\nAnd Dex is unaware that Hyunji plans to eliminate Jinho/Xitsuh behind his back so in his eyes, they're no betrayal in the wild team. So he gets frustrated with Xitsuh during voting for the DM between Hyunji and Pi, as Xitsuh keeps saying things like they take things for granted because Jinho/Xitsuh took risk for the team etc. Because for Dex taking risks for the team is teamplay and Dex himself has taken some risk for the team. But he never held that action as something the others should be grateful for because that's just how teamplay goes.\n\nIt's just their level of maturity that differs how they react i think. Jinho feels betrayed too but he didn't get emotional and instead cleanly settled it with money and thus drew a clear line between them. Xitsuh gets emotional before finally drawing a clear line between them. Dex actually has no problem with anyone and has not betrayed or taken anything for granted, he's just a collateral damage because he teams with Hyunji unknowingly :')",

            "comment": "I\u2019m disappointed in these two episode games, feels very recycled. Ep 9/10 felt like a downgrade, but ep 11/12 is surely a downgrade. The wild team dynamic really is just as I suspected, it really felt like a confirmation of our assumption about how they felt about each other. And they seems to want to push them being conflicted too much, but really the wild team people are too normal for such editing, they were all in actuality they\u2019re just behaving normally w their own lil quirks (Dex\u2019s too loyal, Hyunji\u2019s too calculating, Chulgu\u2019s too fiery, Jinho\u2019s too.. tired). \n\nIt\u2019s not only the games, the PD aren\u2019t very lucky in that they had the entire villain team weeded out (i\u2019d say Jinhyung and Pi is more of an underdog (that no one roots for..) somehow, they got into a very good cozy blind spot). Maybe it has something to do with the protagonist/wild team being too strong, the op-ness is truly a double edged sword for such shows. There\u2019s no heroes without villains and it\u2019s really clear now.\n\nIn ep. 11. Ha Seungjoo really is a good player, I want to see him in another show, though I saw him in the snippets of Jinho\u2019s Project Genius. I\u2019m actually sad about the result of the elimination match, YunB is a snake but he\u2019s our funny snake lol. He made things entertaining and honestly things would have been so dry without him. \n\nIn ep. 12 When I saw Yurisa and Knux I knew immediately they would go for Jinho, it had been pretty clear that they are both pretty fond of him despite their minimal interactions. So it was very predictable and kinda boring. \n\nFor both of these eps, Lee Jinhyung is a savior for making something/anything for them to air. His decisions are not tied to one another and his plans are messy and bears no fruit, honestly it\u2019s at the point of making me have secondhand embarassment. \n\nAlso as per usual Xitsuh and Jinho\u2019s bromance is a running thing haha. I\u2019ve seen a lot of shows and it\u2019s my first time seeing someone ask the negotiator (yunb) to explain the deal to his hyung (jinho) first to essentially make sure he\u2019ll always get to be his dongsaeng despite his moral choices lmao",

It was refreshing to see the 3 strategize openly, meanly the other team was dominated by the 2.

Episode 11 and the split is honestly so refreshing and much needed for the wild team. Aside from the game (which is getting repetitive) and the politics (boring to me too), i like to observe people's dynamic and character. \n\nFrom episode 11, you can see the difference in yunB and Jinyeong when they team with Jinho/Xitsuh. Both yunB and Jinyeong were also key members that strategize/lead in their team, but when with Xitsuh/Jinho, they add some remarks and opinion but also in the end, just follow along with Jinho decision. This shows how overwhelming Jinho/Xitsuh strategy and decision are in the team.\n\nYou can also see the difference in Jinho and Xitsuh when they play with yunB/Jinyeong. Both keep getting frustrated and angry especially towards Jinyeong. And on almost every round of the Money Game aside from the first, they keep getting surprised by the play of the trio, meaning they still fail to predict and outwit them. Xitsuh also keeps checking the other teams reaction and stuff, like how Dex seems happy when the main colour are choose, or how they seems eager to enter after a blunder from Jinyeong, and even when the trio moves away from the hall, he follows along Jinyeong to keep tab on what he's saying to the other side. There's no trust and reliability in them at all, so they have to keep double guessing their own team. Even yunB last move to score points to try to win seems like a surprise to Jinho/Xitsuh. Jinyeong causes head ache during the game and yunB causes head ache when picking DM.\n\nOn the other hand, Hyunji-Dex finally has space to put their own opinion, strategy and wit to use. The Hyunji-Dex-Pi is so healthy i love watching them. Dex leads and strategizes but he listens to the other two opinions too, while clearly explaining and relaying the reasoning and effects of their strategy. Even when Dex initially comes into the game saying things like 'i really want to try to win for once' he didn't actually get greedy and strategize for his win in the team. He also fully respected Jinho/Xitsuh decision when casting vote for the DM.\n\nThey offer alliances to Pi without any bias and Pi, maybe sensing their trustworthiness plays normally without thinking of politics and double crossing for once. There's no resentment and disappointment because all the decisions are made together while respecting each other's needs (maybe aside from Dex cause he still kinda ends up sacrificing himself again..) I enjoy the change in dynamics but it might get a bit stale again after this. But it's also nearing the end so I guess it didn't really matter anymore.",

Dex is allowed to be disappointed in Xitsuh for the misplay from the previous game, he put Dex in danger and lied about it. What things said by Hyunji are you referring to? Also, if you watch the ep 11, Dex &amp; Hyunji are perfectly content playing with their own team and win the main match happily. Like the vibes/team atmosphere was good between just them and Pi. So idk why you believe they were upset when they \"prioritized themselves\" as you say. If you rewatch, it's actually Jinho and Xitsuh especially who come off looking bitter post-outdoor alliance breakup. Xitsuh kept on rambling about the other two \"should be happy to take a nap while Jinho and me calculate\" while they focused on the game",

We don't have all the scenes but based on the ep 12 scene where Xitsuh is trying to get money out of Hyunji, it sounds like Dex and him still didn't hash out what happened. \n\nFrom Xitsuh's perspective, Dex is being weird out of nowhere, and from Dex perspective, Xitsuh tried to throw him under the bus to save himself and wants to act like nothing happened. Honestly its a lack of maturity on both sides, like they could've honestly spoken to each other but I get the pressure's of the game is getting to them",

Stop trying to gloat and seem like you\u2019re all intelligent when you\u2019re actually an idiot with zero strategy. Getting a 100% on the college entrance exam clearly doesn\u2019t mean a thing lol. He needs to go!!!!!!!",

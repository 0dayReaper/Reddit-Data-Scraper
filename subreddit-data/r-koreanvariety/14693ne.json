He did crossfit and did some errands and chores. Not the most entertaining ep but if you were missing sweaty muscley workout scenes in your life then it will def meet that quota.",

            "comment": "So he seems like a solid guy but my god that was the most boring segment I have ever watched on ILA. I have watched a ton of episodes (not all) and when it was over I was genuinely shocked. A literal A-story of his segment was chicken breast. When Key(?) made a comment to the effect of \"they are actually good\" to prevent dead air while the footage of him eating his 4th or 6th breast made me cringe. His segment was wake up, chicken breast, laugh watching TV, workout, home, chicken breast, TV, over. \n\nIt's also cringe how sexualized and oogled at he can be and yet gender swap that, heck even 50% of what the camera shot and the comments made by the cast (specifically Na Rae), and I wonder how triggered SK would be but even more so the international viewing community. \"OMG THIS IS DISGUSTING THEY ARE TREATING THIS WOMAN LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT! STOP SEXUALIZING HER! STOP COMMENTING ON HER BODY!\" as the camera pans up her legs and stops on her ass as she bends over. Pans down her face to her cleavage as the panel goes bonkers over how perky her breasts are and so on. But cause he's a man, slow mo shirt taking off, zoom in on his sweaty torso, zoom in on his ass as he squats, zoom in on his body and pan up his thighs as he lays in bed, the nonstop comments and Na Rae drooling over his body. It was cringey as hell considering how sexist it is.",

The entire panel falls over themselves whenever there is a hot guy and only men ever have shirtless/shower scenes. \n\nThere's a lot to unpack here but only men are sexualized on ILA because of gender inequality/traditional values. SK still values purity in women and most broadcasters try to protect women's bodies/\"dignity\" because of this. A good example of this is the backlash hwasa got from making sexual gestures during her concerts yet male idols routinely take their shirts off/flash their abs and no one ever complains.\n\nThere are exceptions to this rule though like on some kdating shows where all bodies are up for sexualization (e.g. singles inferno, eden). If you compare that to western shows, they are more likely to sexualize everyone bc in general values around sex are less traditional.",

SK still values purity in women and most broadcasters try to protect women's bodies/\"dignity\" because of this. \n\nAnd it's garbage. Don't treat men like pieces of meat just because you can get away with it. Idk about the East but enough men have come out in the West and said they find it demeaning and uncomfortable when they get gawked over and treated that way by hosts, co-stars and such. All the reasons SK (and Western) society says you shouldn't treat a woman like that should apply to all genders. Don't treat people like meat. \n\n&gt;A good example of this is the backlash hwasa got from making sexual gestures during her concerts yet male idols routinely take their shirts off/flash their abs and no one ever complains.\n\nSo this is neither here nor there but I thought I'd point out that this is actually a bad example. What [Hwasa did](https://twitter.com/mamamoofiles/status/1657162524205170693) was the female equivalent of a male performing spitting in his hand and then doing the jerk off motion with said hand right next to his crotch. I'm sorry, but do you see artists, even Western ones, doing that? A woman licking her fingers and then mimicking masturbation with her legs open isn't = a male performer taking off his shirt or even grabbing his crotch. The equivalent of those is her taking off her shirt (with a bra on underneath) and her grabbing her crotch. No need to make false equivalences or inaccurate comparisons. I personally didn't really have an issue with her doing what she did. She was at a college festival, not a performance with kids or something. I just find inaccurate comparisons like this to be fairly annoying.",

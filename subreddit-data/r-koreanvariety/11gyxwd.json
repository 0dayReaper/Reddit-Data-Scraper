And then as guests are eating, he'll just stand there and stare at them from behind the counter. I feel that they should move Wooshik to the front, or honestly, put V up there, when he has some downtime in the kitchen. Either of them would do a better job of greeting the guests, explaining the menu, and just being more energetic and inviting.",

I chalk it up to Wooshik being super busy during that time and having no energy.\n\nI think Wooshik is also a hard worker as shown on youn\u2019s stay. He\u2019ll just do the grunt work and socialize with all the guests without much prior instruction. Seojoon was similar before but he\u2019s in the back kitchen now. So there\u2019s not much interaction with him and guests.\n\nYumi and Seojin are both so much more awkward this season.\n\nBut I can\u2019t wait to see how things progress.",

Both seasons also focused on running a kitchen where the first season took place in Indonesia, while the second in Spain. Unfortunately, Youn Yuh Jung has become busy and her schedule overlaps with the others so Lee Seo Jin stepped up to be the new owner. \n\nAlso, Youn's Kitchen has another spinoff, if you're interested, which is Youn's Stay where instead of only serving food, they ran a guesthouse.\n\nFun Fact: Lee Seo Jin and Jung Yu Mi were the OG cast, Park Seo Joon joined in the second season, Choi Woo Shik started in the guesthouse, and Intern V is the newest.",

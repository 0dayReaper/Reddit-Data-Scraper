With 3 of the 4 male contestants being born in  1985 and the oldest of the female cast being born in 1993 the age gaps just seem wild. I\u2019m just confused at where production was going with this and what did they even expected. \n\nDoes anyone else have any decisions made by production that just shocked you? Can be shocking for positive or negative reasons. But I\u2019m just curious if I\u2019m the only one who cares about things like this",

For the women, the basic criteria was that they were physically attractive and single.  This would skew the men older, and the women younger.  Later similar shows did bring the ages closer, but this tends to result in a lot of the participants being students still, or in show biz.  Heart signal was one of the first shows of its kind?  So they were still figuring things out.  It's a bit like Terrace House or Big Brother.",

            "comment": "The age gap thing is pretty normal in Asia or more conservative places. These days the woman being older is kinda being portrayed in (Korean) media as also okay, see the many recent noona romances.\n\nThere was this issue recently with a (Korean) dating show, I won't say which as it's spoiler to anticipate it. But ya, instead of just keeping the housemate in the show, it seems the producers kicked them out or did they like leave voluntarily.\n\nTo this day, no clear resolution on that. As usually if there's a scandal like bully/fake/etc. stuff then they just ignore it and edit after. Like usually they find out that fact after the show is already made, but for this problem it cropped up right at the beginning of the show (while they were filming it, not months later when editing) and so maybe that's why the producers made that decision.\n\n---\n\nFor Love Catcher in Seoul (third season of Love Catcher), there's also some bullshit that happened and people don't like it at all. For me it was okay since I was too enamored by a girl and vicarious through one of her suitors.\n\nBut ya I can understand why they'd be real mad at how Love Catcher in Seoul unfolded. Like the sequence of events or for some, the lack of excitingness/planning/etc.\n\nAnyway fam, just watch Love Catcher in Bali right now, it's got the best visuals, especially for the female housemates. For male housemates, try Pink Lie.\n\nThough ya in these dating shows the girl being older is so sad as they almost always fail to pair up. Not unless they're like say Ming from Shanghai Sharelife (the Chinese version of Terrace House): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY2x4Y8W8lU&amp;t=62s. \n\nThe producers should add another girl of similar age or like raise the overall age levels of the whole group closer to the girls in their early 30s as otherwise the entire show is so predictable. It's just a sad fact that older girls get sidelined to due societal pressure/preferences/et cetera.\n\n---\n\nBy the way the Heart Signal has a spinoff called Friends. You need to watch the 2nd and 3rd season of Heart Signal first though to have a bit more context. It can still be watched as standalone though.\n\nThere's also the Chinese versions of Heart Signal, Love Catcher (The Secret X (\u673a\u667a\u7684\u604b\u7231), Episode 1 from iQIYI Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTj-dJkp8o), and so on.\n\n---\n\nA list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iyso9ql/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iz8ayph/",

Subscriptions to the OTT app broke records, advertisements and programmes make references to the lines said in the show, the cast still trends every now and then on forums and social media, the cast also had to take down posts that accidentally promote brands on their social medias (something to do with their contracts with the OTT company that should end by end of this year), etc. The most popular cast had her following increase from about 10k to 1m in a span of 4-5 months.\n\nThe emotions are deep in this show since it involves real ex couples and the cast had great chemistry that the friendships were another highlight of the show too, not just the romance stuff.",

Instead of it being paired randomly and so on. They spend usually 5 or so days in some pension/vacation place in the provinces and it's actually fast paced. \n\nI Am Solo is pretty raw, campy, often unintentionally funny and sad, et cetera. If you've seen Ainori Love Wagon: Asian/African Journey, you'd know what I kinda mean by the show being raw. Like lots of confessionals (talking to the producers/camera), and actual cameramen and producer staff being seen and heard throughout the episodes.\n\nThat rawness is kinda the charm or appeal of I Am Solo for some people.\n\nAs yes, most of the time couples don't actually last outside of these dating shows. \n\nSometimes they will be successful and date for a while, but due to contractual and so on obligations, they can't be public until the show is aired, which is usually months later. And so not a lot of relationships last due to limits, long distance relationships, etc.\n\nAnyway, try Heart Signal and Love Catcher, don't forget the Chinese versions. Those also kinda have successful couples. Some of them are not who you expect.\n\nCheck MyDramaList to see if the shows are finished, for the most part they are finished as they're mostly from pre-2022 or like a bunch of shows came out this summer of 2022 and those are also finished by now, some of them don't have English subs though.\n\nRight now the non-finished ones are Love Catcher in Bali (this will probably air for 1 more month or 4/5 more episodes, depends on how they want to go), Pink Lie (this will have its 12th and final episode next Wednesday), Eden 2 (this just started, only on Episode 4 or so, like Love Catcher in Bali), and so on.\n\nThere's Single's Inferno 2 that will be releasing next Tuesday or so and that one will be talked about by many people, maybe. As the first season went viral in Korea and kinda the world due to Netflix reach.\n\n---\n\n**This thread has the different names of streaming/OTT services (like TVING, Coupang Play, wavve, etc.) or websites and the various Youtube channels and links for where to watch some of these dating shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yktjg9/can_anyone_suggest_some_kdating_shows/iuvbg43/**\n\n**For Korean shows specifically, here's the recent ones that appeared around the middle (before/around the summer) of 2022: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/wutb91/dating_shows_currently_airing/ilbxivd/**. There's a lot of brand new Korean dating shows, check the other recent/newer threads above.\n\n---\n\nThough IMO, **start with Terrace House Boys and Girls Next Door (this is kinda how to watch it: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zfkwnq/how_do_i_watch_boys_girls_next_door/izchnov/) as that's where it sorta all started for these East Asian dating shows.\n**\nOr start with Boys and Girls in the City as that's the one available in Netflix.\n\nFor Terrace House, it did have long lasting couples, but they often broke up or something like that. Right now there's a couple that got married and it's not who you think. And then another couple from the same (different from the previous couple) season also just got married/engaged and it's also kinda random and unexpected.\n\nDon't forget Shanghai Sharelife (/r/Shanghaisharelife) as that's the Chinese version of Terrace House, some people really like that (especially due to the panelists). There was actually kinda some cute or funny couples there too.",

Then we have how the hosts are fake-reacting with thier oh's and ah's. The could town that down a notch. The MTF transperson is really good at calling the participants out and explains well about personal accountability. The two ladies should learn a few about hosting from her.

Women like older men cause they know they're more likely to find that in a 30+ year old than a 22 or 25 or 28 year old.\n\nNow if Heart Signal has girls as young as say 24 and there are \\~35-37 year old men on there, then that's... I mean it's not BAD but idk if 24 year olds are wanting a man a few years from 40. But hey, if they don't like them they can not select them, not show interest, turn them down and if need be, just leave the show cause there's no one there of interest.\n\nAlso I don't know where you live but never forget about cultural differences. Obviously some stuff is universal like a show of 21-22 year olds with 35 year olds (no matter the gender). But if the \"younger\" ones are 24+ then they're adults IMO and if they don't like the 30-40-50-60 year old options the show gives them, leave. \n\nOh and especially for first seasons of shows, especially when dating shows are new for the country, don't doubt that casting is HARD. You want attractive, single, good career having men that are 25-30 in South Korea (or really anywhere)? Why would they sign up on a dating show if they are such an amazing catch? Also, that career the women want their man to have is likely what prevents him from being on the show. A good young man with a good career doesn't have 1-3 months to take off for any reason, let alone a reality show. And in South Korea, why risk your career and reputation (as being judged and even cancelled is very real in SK) being on reality TV even if you can be on and still go to work everyday? Producers decide to evil edit a guy and his workplace might fire him cause of the bad PR. Where as men with careers in their mid 30's might have a bit more leeway with their careers and be at a stage in life where they prioritize settling down.",

Also everyone keeps saying age differences are common but all the guys were panicking more than her. I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong in theory for an 11 year age gap. But I think it\u2019s def intimidating especially to be televised\u2026",

Not to mention it's conservative and they are on egg shells to not damage their reputation and that of their family. \n\nBut as for the ages, you said the years they were born which doesn't change for Korean age or International. In SK or not someone born in 85 is 37 and someone born in 93 is 29 years old. Also I believe most people are just one year older in SK and not 2 years older than their international age. \n\nBut yes, as I said in my comment, if there are other ages, which is to say if the 29 year old woman is the oldest but they go as young as 22-23 (international) then I'd be somewhat uncomfortable with that.",

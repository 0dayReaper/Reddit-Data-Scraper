Sure she isn't a comedian who can instantly pick up on Yongjin's bits and go back and forth with him with comedic wit and jokes like Jinho but her vibe is better, especially with female guests. She's more naturally funny. But it's not like I don't watch, I'm enjoying it enough. \n\nI feel like a show that low-key sorta took its place, though they are different, is BamBam's house. I prefer sit down chats like his where some interesting info can get revealed over comedy sketch types like S2 of YHC. S1 seemed to be more chill, sitting infront of each other and digging a little deeper into what's on the guests minds, what are their concerns and such. S2 is just comedic banter and setting up their next punchline.",

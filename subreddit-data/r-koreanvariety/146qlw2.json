She is someone who is very good at responding to any skit thrown at her and fast with comebacks, but this time she looks honestly half nervous, half-afraid and pretty caught off guard and said 'I don't have the power to do that '.",

The other guests were great too, they blended in really well.   \nSomin\u2019s is funny haha her walking off camera to pretend to be sentimental.   \nAfter the earlier post today about SJH, I saw a bit of old SJH towards the end of the episode when she joked around with YJS. Wish we got more of that. But overall, it was rather disappointing to see her stagnant here too, even to the point where the editors basically cut her out when showing group 2\u2019s individual shots in their room since no one even mentioned SJH at all. \n\nPlus, someone else also pointed this out but I\u2019m surprised that she was checking her Apple Watch while filming. That pretty much rubbed me the wrong way.",

Y'all don't even know what she's going through life right now. Shes going through a whole sueing process. She hasn't been paid for a long time from her agency. She still shows up to every episode and does every mission. Shes not the same Jihyo that started off a long time ago but she's loyal to her fans and not quitting. I don't think us fans should quit on her.",

But AJH made it clear in the Ep 88 trailer that the players can leave whenever they want.\n\nThe rest of the players probably will be sub players. It doesn't make sense if they just ignore them after the long audition. Unless they want to create drama and get the ratings up.\n\nIf Im not mistaken in Ep87 (Luge,Skeleton, Bobsleigh Audition) , AJH said the audition will never stop. So the show format will maybe change and focus more on audition plus Title Match Tour something like that. So basically, they are promoting and recruiting players from less well-known sports.\n\nThis new format can go south real quick if the PDs don't have a proper plan. I mean, K-nets are already complaining that they want real matches. Glad that we're not the only ones who feel the same.",

Can someone please tell me if the three left out as well as those absent have a chance to come back or are they out entirely? I would really appreciate your help \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd72",

He was what I was looking forward to watching up until episode 40s or something. But anyways I'll still support the team and look forward to how the new members can contribute to them winning titles. Maybe in the future they will join another competition again.",

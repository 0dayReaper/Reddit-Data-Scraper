    "postText": "~~Haven't been able to find any other source on this (and this site has mixed reporting to say the least), so I'm kind of hoping this is just fake news...If not,~~ This makes me so sad :( He's one of the biggest reasons why I tune in. \n\nhttps://www.allkpop.com/article/2021/04/lee-kwang-soo-to-leave-the-cast-of-running-man-after-11-years\n\nStatement from agency: \n\"We notify that Lee Kwang Soo will be leaving the cast of SBS's 'Running Man' after his final recording on May 24. \n\nAfter becoming involved in his car accident last year, Lee Kwang Soo has received regular physical therapy; despite the continued treatment, there were times when he felt that it was difficult to maintain top physical condition during 'Running Man' filmings. As a result, Lee Kwang Soo held lengthy conversations with the production staff, crew, his fellow cast members, as well as the agency, and ultimately arrived at the conclusion that he needed time to recuperate, both physically and mentally.\n\nBecause it is a program that Lee Kwang Soo called his home for the past 11 years, it was difficult for him to come to this decision. However, it was inevitable when considering his intention to show viewers a better image in the future. \n\nWe sincerely thank all of the viewers for the love they showed Lee Kwang Soo on 'Running Man', and Lee Kwang Soo promises to greet you all again with a bright and healthy image.\"",

Especially since it\u2019s in its 11th year now. \n\nNow I don\u2019t know what will happen but I\u2019m really bummed because they couldn\u2019t do any big 10th year anniversary projects. So Min &amp; Se Chan just celebrated their 4th anniversary. \n\nAnd because it\u2019s Kwangsoo that is leaving, the impact will be enormous. Ugh. \n\nI can\u2019t help thinking worst case scenario. This hits me way harder than when IC finished up because I\u2019ve been following from day 1. Even for IC, the members never really went on to the same amount of visibility so I\u2019m really going to miss seeing them every week if RM is cancelled. Arghhhhhh",

I dont really follow Korean entertainment industry and Running Man is my only source for knowing a little bit about what happening in Korean entertainment industry. \n\nLike Gary, when he leaves the only time I heard of him is when RM member talked about his marriage and when RM member joked about how Ji Hyo could be in that Superman show with him. Other than that I have zero knowledge. He is my favourite member back then. Its sad, feels like I lost a friend.",

He has consistently been the MVP for Running Man, and never fail making people laugh. A variety star like him is truly once in a lifetime.\n\nOf course, his health should always come first and I will always root for the Asia Prince no matter what.",

With him leaving, there will be very noticeable hole in humor of the show.\n\nNow, I am not saying that we need some member to take over his role, or get close to his level of slapstick, but other members will need to definitely step up at least a little to make the show more interesting.",

From the couple episodes he appeared in, he seems a lot funnier and easygoing that I imagined him to be. \n\nI guess with any young and upcoming actor I tend to expect them to try keep their imagine more focused on that of an actor, rather than a variety show personality. Plus I've always wondered if casting directors shy away form casting actors with overbearing variety show characters?

Partly because I know that if any other member left, I'd see them again in some form regularly (except Ji Hyo), but Kwang Soo has made it clear that the only variety show he'd ever do is Running Man because of his gratitude towards the cast, the staff, and to YJS. If he really does leave for good, this might be farewell to comedian Kwang Soo.\n\nI'm deeply sad, but that's just made me realize how thankful I am for the guy I've watched the past 10 years. He started off as a gossiping, dirty-looking beanpole but ended up as one of the most entertaining and endearing characters on TV. We even witnessed the beginning of the man's romance!\n\nThere's gonna be a hole in my life now, but at least I have nearly 600 episodes worth of stupidity, betrayal, misfortune, ingenuity and laughter to look back on.",

Put him with Jaesuk for the most potent effect (I still want them to win best couple but it seems impossible now). He's often chosen by guests because they like him and/or they think he's hilarious, not to mention that he's good friends with many top celebrities which shows his character. And also, he puts in 200% effort every episode. Remember how he immediately made himself look ugly in the \"biggest eyes\" contest? Most people wouldn't dare. \n\nI often say Kwangsoo is a perfect success story. He started out as a mostly nobody with the worst position in a comedy show, the idiot that gets made fun of. But he took his job seriously and was the *BEST* idiot that gets made fun of. He was creative, crafty, endearing, and crazy. He had the top man Jaesuk by his side so he had the best support there was, and they even became bestfriends. It shows how lovable he is as the cast and guests would often praise him even though his fake persona is that of a betrayer. Then he becomes super popular with the \"Asia Prince\" title from his fans. Then later on it's revealed he's dating Lee Sunbin, one of the most talented and gorgeous women in Korea. Them dating was nearly universally praised as both of them are well-liked. He worked his way from the bottom to the top with hard work and effort, and I'm proud of how successful he is now. He is a gem that is absolutely irreplaceable. \n\nI wish him the best going forward. I think he's an incredible person inside and out and I respect his decision, as well as hoping for a good recovery. But I think it's totally okay to be sad and upset at the news, it's natural. It shows how much we love him. Let's just hope he continues on to the path he wants in the future, wherever it leads him. Thank you for everything Lee Kwangsoo!",

After LKS\u2019s departure, when the ratings drop, the last ditch effort would be a new member, but those are big shoes to fill. I respect his decision to leave &amp; the 7 who want to continue.

Even when he was characterized as like the loser of the group, you could tell he wanted to at least make the episode as entertaining as possible by playing up that role. It\u2019s like even if he couldn\u2019t win a game, he could at least act like a fool to get some laughs. And don\u2019t get me started on that sad acoustic guitar music that plays literally every time something bad happens to him. That alone gets a laugh out of me from how often they use it.\nWell, I sure have a long way to go until I get to his final episode so I\u2019ll be sure to enjoy the future highlights with him as I continue watching.",

As a result, Lee Kwang Soo held lengthy conversations with the production staff, crew, his fellow cast members, as well as the agency, and ultimately arrived at the conclusion that he needed time to recuperate, both physically and mentally.*  \n\n\n*Because it is a program that Lee Kwang Soo called his home for the past 11 years, it was difficult for him to come to this decision. However, it was inevitable when considering his intention to show viewers a better image in the future.*\u00a0  \n\n\n*We sincerely thank all of the viewers for the love they showed Lee Kwang Soo on 'Running Man', and Lee\u00a0Kwang Soo promises to greet you all again with a bright and healthy image.\"* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo seems confirmed. Lee Kwang Soo on Running Man is a legendary Korean Variety show character/presence. Very sad news. I also feel bad that his health was such that he needs to do this as well, it did seem like he came back from that leg injury much too quickly when he rejoined.",

I can\u2019t really think of anybody else who can do the same thing. I\u2019m not sure if the show will be able to continue. If they hire someone else to fill a similar role they\u2019re going to be bashed like crazy the first year by netizens, if they don\u2019t have anyone fill the role, the show may grow stale. The only upsides to LKS leaving is that deciding who gets the punishments at the end is a lot more random now that everyone doesn\u2019t have an easy to choose target and some jokes that have already grown stale, like YJS interrupting LKS every episode, won\u2019t continue. The dynamic YJS had with LKS was still the best though. I always felt that there wasn\u2019t a better comedy pair and YJS legitimately saw him as a junior. After he leaves I really hope the pair can do another show together (not something scripted like Busted). It doesn\u2019t have to be a show that requires physical activity as long as there\u2019s a dialogue dynamic.\n\nEdit: If he does get replaced, I would like to give an unknown a chance. There\u2019s nobody else really known I\u2019m crazy about except maybe LSY but he just took a role on Sixth Sense which already has YJS and JSM. Not that good to have the same cast for every show.",

It's sad to see him go but his health is a big priority so if it's meant to be then so be it. As many have already mentioned, LKS is a pillar for RM, much like YJS and it will be difficult seeing him no longer in the show's lineup.\n\nBecause of his departure, I can't help but feel like this will just be the beginning of other departures. (Though I do sincerely hope this isn't just yet) It just gives of a different feel from Gary's. We will, sadly and eventually, have to come to terms with the fact that all of the cast have grown older and have accumulated injuries throughout the years. Though, imo, never really expected LKS to be the next one after Gary, given his age. (I guess, no one really did, but after his accident I guess it was inevitable)\n\nIf he does choose to return, that would be really great. I do hope it's when he has fully recovered and is in really good condition. I know it's great seeing him, and all of the cast for that matter, doing their best but I just hope they won't push themselves too much. I mean they are really entertaining but if them doing so gives them soo much pain, I'd rather they take a long break and recover.

I fully believe Kwang-soo should do what's right for him, his body, and his future (we already have one example on the show of someone who really suffered physically from variety, so I'm glad Kwang-soo is taking care of himself). However he's such an integral part of the show's charm and how it has grown over the past 11 years... it absolutely won't be the same show without him &amp; I'm devastated as a long-time fan. The timing is especially tough, with the pandemic limiting their options in terms of the send-off they can give him, and also with the show (I personally feel) actually having the cast members try new things and experiment and produce some great episodes especially in recent months.\n\nI hate to say it because I don't want it to be true, but I also worry that this could be the start of the end for RM as we know it. I always suspected, especially after the last member controversy, that the next time one of the OG members had to leave, the show might be ended or revamped with a new cast-- I just never for a moment thought it would be Kwang-soo leaving; it seemed more likely that Suk-jin would just age out, or Jong-kook's body would be the one that couldn't hold out, or Ji-hyo would decide to focus on her acting career. \n\nMy hope currently is that they continue on as a seven person crew and try to find their footing, similarly to the last time they weathered such a change, rather than immediately bringing in new members or even test members-- the shoes Kwang-soo leaves behind will be big and near impossible to fill.",

I kind of expected someone will leave sooner or later.\n\nKwangsoo is an actor &amp; he has always mentioned that he wanted to be known as an actor.Everytime people who watch him in a drama,we tend to think of him as funny even if he is being serious.Yes we can't hide the fact that everytime we see him,we always laugh at his expression.\n\nI am glad he actually willing to remove himself from RM to take care of his health.We won't know when we will be healthy again.So it a good decision of him to take a break.\n\nUnlike YJS,he can't take a break,but he certainly can take a break,but he has too many shows that are currently airing(plus those that are not from mainstream).\n\nThe 4 bros(JK,Haha,Sukjin &amp; YJS) are very influential towards K-entertainment.The moment they take a break,it will be a huge change.\n\nAnyway,rest well our Giraffe.Sunbin,please take care of your boyfriend.",

End of an era - hoping RM can take this in stride and weather the ratings drop ! LKS was so funny and truly dedicated- coming to the show with crutches! Crying  here / get well soon Oppa !",

I love the other cast as well but nothing will top their interactions with Lee Kwang Soo. I've been watching the show since its debut 11 years ago, so this news has hit me like a ton of bricks.\n\nI do wish Lee Kwang Soo a healthy recovery however. Who knows maybe in the future he'll be back!",

I love his bickering with YJS cutting him off all the time..now we won\u2019t see that anymore :( no more betraying either.. I understand his position though. I know all the original members have discs and are getting old. Their health is not in the best condition.",

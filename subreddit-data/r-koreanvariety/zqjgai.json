    "postText": "So I just started Heart Signal 3 this week and I'm currently on ep. 5.\n\nThis is my first Heart Signal and I'm a bit confused, don't they show the text/SMS between the participants like in Transit Love/Pink Lie? (watching it on Viki). \n\nAlso, are all the participants in Season 3 introverts? They all seem shy and reserved so I find their interactions a bit boring.\n\nOne thing I particularly like about the participants though is they're all tidy, they clean and don't make a mess in the house.",

Once you're done with the Korean version, I'd highly recommend the Chinese version. Season 2 and 5 are among some of my favorite romance varieties and I've watched A LOT. The Youku shows on YouTube are god-tier too (e.g., Twinkle Love). You'll have post-show depression. I got into romance varieties with Love Me Actually, then Heart Signal. Have to say, something about the editing and videography in the Chinese shows are so much better, although you get very apparent advertisements. Only recent Korean romance varieties I've finished and/or currently watching are Transit Love s2, Pink Lie, and Love Catcher in Bali.",

            "comment": "No, it kinda actually evolved/changed over time from the first Heart Signal and other similar shows. Just keep watching, it's mainly for the love lines that the panelists try to guess but ya.\n\nThat Episode 5 of Heart Signal 3 was legendary because of Ga-heun (SeulgiBear) saying she's not nice to everyone. \n\nWait, how come there was no Episode 5 discussion thread for it, only Episode 4 and 6: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/geyro3/heart_signal_3_ep06_20200506/\n\nLike it's on the /r/heartsignal subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/heartsignal/comments/gaoco1/heart_signal_3_episode_5_discussion/) but not here in /r/koreanvariety, what happened, lol. It's been so long, don't remember.\n\n---\n\nAnyway ya Season 3 sorta had more introverts than usual. If you want extrovert or insider/social butterfly/etc. watch Season 2 as that's considered the legendary season. After Season 2 watch the Heart Signal spinoff called Friends as you can see more friendship interactions too.\n\nIf you want less boring or more fast-paced interactions, try the Love Catcher series, they're on a shorter timer and so some people move real quick.\n\nOr the Chinese version of Heart Signal, sometimes they move differently there due to the different culture/etc.\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zpwve5/dating_show_recs/j0v9q6u/**",

Thread was on 20200430 instead of 20200429. Ya these days the discussion thread people post the threads usually like say 12 or so hours early (or right when it airs in Korea) as a lot of the time things are still not simulcast (unless it's from Netflix or Disney+ and so ya Viki and VIU are still delayed) and so there's like a 12/24 hours or so delay for the subs.",

Recommend you at least watch til he appears.\n\nAnd if you've noticed, the participants are a little bit older than the other Korean tv shows, and many have non-youtube, normal careers, so are relatively conservative. As they don't want to cause controversy. This was also one of the first dating reality shows, so folks were a bit shy.",

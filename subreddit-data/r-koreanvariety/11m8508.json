traps and controls, then passes to the right side **BD 7** she dribbles down the wing and passes to **BD 10** who is in the middle of the field and cuts down the wing with **BD 10** continuing the textbook give-and-go play right back to **BD 7**'s feet, with **SF 777** coming back to defend **BD 7** takes a quick shot on target that **SF 67 (GK)** saves and smothers, Coach **JinChul** is now getting loud with instructions to **SF 707**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' BD Miss: **SF 707** starts to take the ball down her right wing side with an individual effort getting double teamed by **BD 3** and **BD 10** stopping her just after the centreline, the ball gets loose and **BD 10** gains control and kicks a long rolling pass down the other wing where **BD 7** is running, the ball is

stating to **SF 777** to keep playing until the whistle is called, no offense developed from this free kick, **SF 95** is subbed off looks like her fitness is poor!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' BD FOUL: **SF 707** gets tripped up by **BD 10** and falls hard and lands on her knee, she is subbed off with **SF 22** coming in, hopefully it's just a skinned knee and not serious, she took off her knee brace and getting it iced on her bench, SF resolve on defense grows stronger with their captain off the field, **SF 23** takes the defensive sweeper position that **SF 707** was responsible for!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' BD Miss: **BD 3** kicks a lobbing pass towards **BD 10** who takes a one-time volley shot after a bounce that **SF 01** blocks just enough of to keep it out, the ball goes out of bounds!&lt;\n\n\n\n\nHALFTIME SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- BallaDream 0 - 0  StreamingFighter  ------SF is playing uninspired offense but playing good tight defense, their communication is great but lack finesse on offense, BD aren't taking advantage of the opportunties they've had-------!&lt;\n \nHighlights:&gt;!~10' BD Miss: **SF 01** kicks the ball away that eventually lands on the feet of **BD 7** dekes out **SF 23** and dribbles towards the goal unmarked, **BD 7** takes a shot that goes wide left by a foot on the wide low post, **SF 707** is still on the bench icing her

in!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' BD Miss: **BD 3** kicks a lobbing pass towards **BD 24** but **BD 10** gets the ball after it bounces off the ground, to control the ball **BD 10** uses her right shoulder and takes a shot on goal missing the far left post by inches with a power shot that beat **SF 67 (GK)** but didn't go in the net!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' BD Miss: **SF 707** gives the ball away to **BD 7** who plays a give-and-go with **BD 10**, **SF 777** runs back to mark **BD 10** and the play is a little rushed that **BD 10** gets a weak re-direction on target that is easily saved by **SF 67 (GK)**, **SF 22** is subbed off for **SF 23**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' BD Miss: **BD 7** sees a loose ball and takes a shot towards a crowd of SF defenders, the ball squeezes through the legs of all the SF defenders and looks to be going through **SF 67 (GK)**'s legs, but she closes them and smothers the ball, it is not **BD 7**'s day!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' BD Miss: **BD 10** takes a corner kick-in with a set play, **BD 10** and **BD 24** run their routes, but the pass is kicked long to **BD 3** who takes a great shot on target high and down the middle, but **SF 67 (GK)** jumps and gets her hands on the ball and deflects it, then the ball hits the crossbar and goes just over the net and out of bounds!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' BD Miss: **BD 7** takes a corner kick-in, **BD 10** running her route but with **SF 707** smothering her, **BD 10** is pushed and a foul is called, a direct free kick is awarded just at the 16yard line off center to the left wing, **BD 10** takes the free kick with a pass to a wide open **BD 3** who takes a shot that just misses the top right corner, lots of BD chances, no finish, no offense being developed by SF!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' SF Miss: **BD 24** botches her first touch and **SF 777** steals the ball, and kicks a forward pass down the right wing for **SF 23** who takes a difficult angle shot on net that **BD 27 (GK)** easily smothers, **SF 777** cut down the middle hoping for a pass or rebound so her positioning looks great!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' BD Miss: **BD 10** takes a shot on net but **SF 707** is there to block it, it goes out of bounds just wide of the right post, **SF 67 (Gk)** was in position to save the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' BD Miss: **BD 10** takes a corner kick-in quickly at the request of **BD 7**, **BD 10** crosses a pass to **BD 7** who takes a shot on net and misses just off target wide to the low left post side!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15'

kick-in meant for **BD 3** she dribbles half the field and gets a shot off that goes through the legs of **BD 27 (GK)** but misses wide on the short left post, great individual effort by **SF 23**, looks like **BD 7** is getting gassed from the lack of scoring and aggressive SF defense!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' SF Miss: **SF 23** takes a corner kick-in (SF's first) with a power cross that goes towards **SF 707** who misses the re-direction chance, the ball continues through and goes out of bounds on the other side!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' BD Miss: **BD 7** takes a corner kick-in with a cross that is aimed for SF goal mouth, **SF 67 (GK)** smothers the ball to prevent any threats!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' SF FOUL: **BD 7** gets pushed by **SF 23** near the centreline area, a direct free kick is awarded, no shot on target was completed from this free kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!19' SF GOAL: **BD 7** takes a sideline kick-in with a pass down the wing to **BD 10**  who lays a short pass intended to be for **BD 7** but **SF 777** intercepts that pass and dribbles forward, beating **BD 3**, and getting a low rolling shot off on target that hits the post and re-directs in, GREAT individual effort by **SF 777**, **BD 27 (GK)** was playing deep and got herself out of position, SF team as a whole celebrate and cry tears of joy, the shot was perfect, the dodging of the mark from **BD 3**, great effort and great goal, well deserved, only need one chance and one finish to win a game!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!20' BD Miss: **BD 7** takes a sideline kick-in with a cross pass to **BD 10**  who takes a one-time shot that is aimed at the top left corner, **SF 67 (GK)** sticks out her right hand and blocks the ball from going in, the ball goes out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!20' BD Miss: **BD 10** takes a sideline kick-in with a cross pass to **BD 7**  who takes a one-time shot that is aimed at the bottom left corner, the ball hits the outside of the post and goes out of bounds for a goal kick!&lt;\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFINAL SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- BallaDream 0 - **1  StreamingFighter** ------ CRAZY result, where everyone was expecting a scoreline of 10-0 for BD, you only need one chance and one finish, BD's inability to finish must be addressed by Coach DaeSe, SF went into the game with a plan and even with no real positives with their offense plugged along and trusted in their gameplan, this was what Lee YoungPyo wanted when his Actionista team lost the gold medal game to Lee JungEun and NatFam, the pefect melodramatic cover song of \"Creep\" to represent the drama that just unfolded to us the audience, looks like **Seo MoonTak** is taking the losses hard as she is stating that ever since she joined they haven't won a game, she is now thinking she might be the reason. -----!&lt;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!TopGirl vs. FireMoths, looks like DaYoung is getting a lot more playing time, the worry of the defending champion's jinx is stated multiple times!&lt;",

I cannot wait to watch the subbed version with me not pausing and rewinding a zillion times.",

At least for me the entire Top Girl lineup from the beginning till now is pure 'fanservice' to see them all unexpectedly together doing team-related events.\n\nAnd BD is becoming like a current era version of that for me too: last episode with speculation in this thread about the new member I hoped they cast some of my favorite singers I know like Baek Yerin, Kwon Jin Ah or HYNN but thinking it was unlikely due to busy schedules.  And then they get &gt;!Cassy!&lt; on the show who together with MINSEO are some 'random favorites' I found out about through OSTs and Spotify algo's.\n\nHuge shoutout to coach Choi, almost instantly fixed the 'defending spaces' issue of the team even though it's not perfect yet. And MINSEO for playing like a true Futsall GK. She has the first touch and composure that Hye Ryun lacked when trying to play like that under coach Byung Ji.",

            "comment": " I said last week they had a chance and they fucking did it. That was a hard fought, deserved win they were compact, disciplined and most importantly they were intense when they needed to be the most. For good chunks of the game they let BD have possession but once it got to the final third they turned it on closed down on passing lanes. BD still had good chances but when it comes to soccer you play with your food you starve. Goalkeeper had huge saves and focus that had the great effect of reenergizing the team. And final Choi Jin Cheul shows why in my opinion he is the best coach on the show. He took the wild energy that they have and utilized it perfectly, and encouraged them while holding them accountable. As for BD they implemented their game model and had good chances but again they couldn\u2019t capitalize and lost. I still actually think they have a chance to get promoted as the other teams will try to be more offensive which should suit them but they have to regain that killer mentality that got them promoted the first cuz the threat of suspension will turn up the volume up to a level that was not their the first time they were in the challenge league.",

An outright win at that (no penalty shoot-out)\n\nThe only thing that gave me the hint of them being able to compete was last week's episode ending where you see Choi JinChul exhausted from coaching his team.  He was trying his best to get them up to competitive levels versus the teams he has seen before.\n\nCoach JinChul was even more aggressive with his shouting from the sidelines.  But I guess he knows how to push his newbie filled team.  \n\nSF goalkeeper IlJooEoTeo was outstanding.  Albeit a bit slow, her reaction time and positioning were great.\n\nSeeing Jin JeolMi improve her poor fitness was outstanding.\n\nEuDDeum was solid, and KKangMi did great.\n\nI hope they work on. Their collective offensive schemes and skills more because defensive games can be bad for variety shows like this.\n\nChallenge League will definitely be intense.  My prediction of 1 or 2 being ww or bd, 3 for NF, and last for SF may be totally wrong.",

I'm glad they're doing that, since part of LSG's value-add for the show is his quips with the coaches &amp; players during the game.\n\nIt's humorous to watch Ye Won, as she is still figuring out what is the difference between \"handball\" vs. \"terrified self-preservation\".  She's getting screen time, so I hope she continues to improve and grow.",

The twists and turns, the player development, the camaraderie, and most important of all, genuine passion and interest from most of the players.\n\nAs for the winners of the match, &gt;!Streaming Fighters,!&lt; I only knew 1weekdieter from that dieting show, and Euddeum and Kkangmi from Physical 100, so it's not like I know much about Streaming Fighters but I am honestly rooting for them now. Mad props to 1weekdieter especially this match for her cheering and optimism, and overcoming her lack of agility by being focused and having good game sense.\n\nI was so sure &gt;!BallaDream was going to win by 2:0!&lt; or something but am surprised their defense was so bad. Of course Streaming Fighter's tenacious pressing and stamina made things much harder for them but b/w Kyungseo having a bad day and the coach not really implementing the other players well, they felt like a shadow of their past self. I don't want to jinx anything but they're going to have to play their next match as if it's their last (it actually is since it's relegation again) and I just want to see Seogi &amp; Kyungseo at tip-top shape and the rest of team actually working together.\n\nNext match we're already getting Super League so prob alternating matches b/w Super and Challenge until relegation for the latter. Fire Moth is scary though, especially now that they've worked on incorporating Soyeon more (and Sunyoung always insane) but Top Girl was S3's champion for a reason. I think they will overcome the defending champion curse cuz just from the preview alone, most of the team members have their moment to shine and contribute, which is one of Top Girl's greatest asset, unlike BD who relied on the duo of Kyungseo/Seogi too much. I'm still awed by how much discipline Top Girl players have compared to the rest of the league. Either way, it's a step up in technical skills compared to this match (though that didn't make it any less thrilling when 1weekdieter blocked all those shots and Yeawon got her blooter). So excited for this season as players are continuing to improve, new members added to the mix help spice things up, and even the new team is making waves to give the old ones the push needed to improve.\n\nedit: shoot forgot to give a HUGE thumbs up to Coach Choi Jin Chul for being such a great coach, giving them enough basics to go on but also pushing and rewarding them when they work hard and are able to pull off what they've learned. best coach for me. also, have to mention it since it was talked about in the discord, I absolutely agree with those saying he's had the best luck for goalkeepers from irene to ayumi and now 1weekdieter too.",

With SF, he had 6 girls with no Football experience.  \n\n\nAng Yea Won has incredible potential and I see her developing in the same vein as Kim Ga-Young, OneWeekDieter is good enough against the offense of the remaining two teams, Kang Mi and Eudeum only need to improve their passing and they'll be an even bigger threat on both ends and the one that surprised me the most was JinJeolme, she was a non-factor in the scrimmage game, but she did a great job containing Seogi, and has shown improvements in all facets of her game including her stamina which was her most glaring weakness.",

Slightly more common examples include Namgoong (as in the actor Namgoong Min), and Jegal (can't think of a celeb with this surname off the top of my head, but there was a drama late last year called Mental Coach Jegal in which the main character was named Jegal Gil).",

You're right that Seo is also a proper last name. 2 syllable last names are confusing, even for Koreans. For example, the most common 2-syllable family name is Namgoong, but Nam is also a legitimate (and much more common) family name.  \n\nThe most common name structure in Korean is 3 characters - either [1-syllable family name + 2 syllable given name] or [2-syllable family name + 1 syllable given name]. Since there are no spaces between the family and given names in Korean, people with the 2+1 name structure spend much of their lives correcting people who erroneously assume that their given names are the last 2 characters\ud83d\ude13\n\nSorry for the long spiel, this Seomoon thing is pretty inconsequential but I thought I'd just share!",

Especially with BD as their first game. But coach Choi Jin Chul really is building their team from the ground up (just as he did with Top Girl) and the strength of their defense was a work of art really!! Once their attack is put in place they\u2019re gonna be a real tough team to play against!! (They already have players with good potential attack-wise) \u2014 Special shoutout to their goalkeeper Iljooyeoteo (oneweek7), who surprisingly showed a Lot of potential, all while keeping their team\u2019s mental in check!\n\n&gt;!I was so so sad for BD (but that\u2019s just because I\u2019m that fond of them haha). Also it might be the editing but I kept wondering what their coach was doing throughout their game\u2026 I love his enthusiasm and all the effort he puts into BD\u2019s training is super admirable but shouldn\u2019t the coach jump in when the team\u2019s trying everything they know and it\u2019s simply not working? Was it just bad luck because their goals kept not going in? BD has amazing technique and teamwork but surprisingly crumble in moments like this when their usual tiki-taka is cut. (Is it them not coming back fast enough for defense?) Wasn\u2019t a fan of bringing Minseo up either, I\u2019m not well-versed in soccer but I felt like it brought more danger than benefits during this game. Coach said he wanted to focus on attack but I feel like their defense must be strengthened especially after losing such an essential defensive player. I really hope they can pierce through this hard time because I feel like they can really progress that much more as a team. Really felt for Kyungseo who\u2019s arguably one of my favourite players, hope her mental is going to be okay.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Anyway all in all a game that personally made me sad for BD and yet made me tear up during the SF goal nonetheless because you can see with the results how much time and effort they put into building themselves from the ground up (once again thanks to their coach). Looking forward to their progress! !&lt;",

She is a bit of a goofball but the best keeper in the league right now. Mentally she more relaxed and her focus during the game was excellent. She will definitely help instill confidence in the team since they do not have to worry about the back end, just like TG knew that their goalkeeper will take care of them and can freely open up their play. Coach JinCheol is readying the team , mentally and physically, as same as he prepared TG. Now they have to prepare for a faster and more aggressive team like FC Wonderwoman.",

I am mistaken FC Streaming Fighters\n\nWe are all sorry and mistaken.\n\nCoach Choi JinChul pulled a miracle and trained FS players to be game ready within 1 month. He is now a definitely proven coach in Shooting Stars. FS players fitness were upgraded tremendously from debut game and their focus and trust in each other were outstanding. I made fun of Dieter in their debut game, but it seems that she has found her calling. Calm and stable as an iceberg is what she is right now. ( I am so sorry Diet Lady) Their defensive play was tight, and their  positioning in this game was unwavering. Great job. Expecting them to develop their skills level for the next game, so they can add an offensive element to their game.\n\nFC Balladream. Oh my Ballad! This could be a challenging season for you. If you can't handle a brand new team after playing in the Super League, you painted a big target on your back. Before we all said that they are expected to dominate Challenge League. After this game, they will be playing this season with a mindset of not being the bottom rank team and be suspended. CL and a ticket for Super League has opened up for grab now. No team is a sure team now.\n\nIt gonna be a good Challenge League this season.",

The one that can do something is playing as goalkeeper. Its gonna be one the woman v2, replace all player except: Seogi, Kyungseo and Minseo or getting suspended like anaconda.

The crunching 50-50 where she stood her ground and barely moved had me cheering, not to mention that fluid turn. Lovely stuff, and evidence of hard work on the physical side of her game to complement her positive attitude.\n\nActually think that Seogi/Kyungseo have been overindulged in general and allowed to stagnate. BD threw away several winning positions last season with complacent finishing and lapses in concentration. That's not solely misfortune, and strikes me as an ingrained pattern. The fact that they got sniped by a streetwise, physical team like Gavengers in a high pressure game was hardly a surprise. They could do with a grumpy, moderately hard-ass coach ordering them to the weight room and calling out casual finishing when necessary.\n\nYaewon from Streaming fighters, or whatever they are called, has Kim Gayong levels of potential. That was a serious pace burst. Once the initial newcomer panic is coached away, she's doing some damage on the counter attack.",

            "comment": "This match is why this show is one of my favorites. I totally ate my words last week and they proved me wrong and I feel great about it. \n\nCoach JinChul and SF did what NatFam tried and failed to do. I totally underestimated his coaching and the team\u2019s growth. They went from needing oxygen on the side to outrunning a team from the super league. I did not think a month would be enough time for them to fix that. The teamwork was there but also their communication really had me rooting for them. They were vocal the whole time and each player contributed in the game. The biggest danger was when &gt;!Kkangmi was injured and they couldn\u2019t adjust the passing up the field!&lt;. I also saw instances where they were too focused on the ball and also had a lack of awareness on where their teammates were but if they keep playing and stay vocal they could fix it. \n\nNow issues with BD are the same as always imo. Besides the KyeongSeo and Seogi combo play. They did not try anything new in terms of offense. Seogi might be permahurt cause it seems like she walks the whole game. New Coach seems to be passive and wants them to play hero ball. Teams in the Super League like Giants and TG have started to involve their bench or weaker players in the game. Lisa had no growth, hardly touched the ball. The new player, I don\u2019t remember her even touching the ball. Tak stepped up to take on the role as the main defender but she\u2019s older and not as quick as a lot of forwards so I can see that being a problem in the future. I thought he was being arrogant but what Jinchul said in the interview was kinda right &gt;!BD relies too much on Kyeongseo Seogi and not enough on teamwork overall!&lt;\n\nCan\u2019t wait till the next episode, I wonder if the \u201ccurse\u201d is real. We shall see. Dayeong showed potential in the dark horse team. She might be better as a middle than a forward tho. I love TG pass plays",

BD is giving me the Anaconda unlucky vibes right now.  They will need to score a goal to lift their spirits but again the only other team they have a better chance at beating would be NF with their team overhaul which we have no idea about.  \n\nKnowing that SF can compete and win just made all our preseason predictions go awry.

            "comment": "Thoughts: \n\n1. I can't get over how good Minseo is and how valuable she is at keeper. She's been playing for such a short time but she plays with so much confidence and with the skills of a field player. Her usage in the game goes so far beyond just blocking goals. She comes down and defends and even assists the offense when she is part of the buildup and even some shots at the goal. She is absolutely the best goalie on the show in my mind and she is just getting started. Wild!! She reminds me of the goalie version of Lee Ju-myeong (FC WW) with her build, football IQ, and skills. She was good and looked like she'd become an ace but then left the show.\n2. I'm a little confused as to the timeline of FC SFighter. They met for the first time then said they had a scrimmage match within days (iirc) and then this match was a short time since then scrimmage match? I thought they had like a month or something to train before their first match but it seems like they were rushed the whole way. \n3. Consider me seriously impressed with FC SFighter. They looked pretty bad in the scrimmage in multiple ways but in this match against a team I hold very highly they held their own\n4. It makes sense to put Diet at goalie and Gangg Mi at center back but it's a bummer because Ganng Mi in her first scrimmage looked good and like she could be a top goalie. But it's better to be strong at center back and mid at goalie than good at goalie and bad at center back. It's either few shots on goal and maybe she blocks 50% or lots of shots on goal and you are praying Gangg Mi can block 90% or more of them. But as the game goes on, maybe she is a good goalie in her own right? I can't tell if she's getting lucky or doing a really good job naturally at the position. Will need to see her play more games to determine one or the other. \n5. During the first half I was left wishing Seogi would move down a bit so she could join the offensive attack rather than pass it off then hangout just a bit past mid field. I get FC BDream has two offensive players and, more importantly, keeping Seogi fresh and uninjured is critical, but with FC SFighter's 3 man defense they just weren't making it work. Seogi down there provides a great player who can take a rebound and make accurate shots on the goal or perfectly pass it to one of the forwards who shoot it. She seemed to get a bit more involved in this way when Gangg Mi left due to injury and has stayed more offensive on that side of the field in the second half.\n6. Watching this game I really wish the FC BDream coach had told Lisa to stick to the goal post when Seogi and Kyoung Seo were doing their thing, offensively. So many shots were near the post and just need someone there to redirect the ball instead of it rolling by out of bounds. She'd be more impactful and of value standing a few feet from the goal post (left side) than where she has been which is about 10-15 feet from the goal. \n7. As a Yea Won fan from Singles Inferno and her social media afterwards, she is being authentically herself from what I can tell with how kind she is and it's adorable. Unlike others, including myself, where it is more about courtesy and sportsmanship, she seems to be deeply kind. You can see that with her crying over Gangg Mi's injury.\n8. Shouldn't that shot Seogi took (49:40) have been a handball? Maybe it was unintentional so it didn't get called but Seogi shot accurately at the goal and the only reason it didn't go in is it hit Jinjeolme's arm which deflected it. A handball in the goalie box is a penalty kick which for Seogi is like 90% odds she scores.   \nAlso at 1:08 the same thing happened when Seogi shot and it hit Ganng Mi's elbow and deflected away. It wasn't as obvious and her arms were tight to her body but...\n9. At this point I don't think FC BDream can rely on Tak as a shooter on corner kicks. Center backs on this show are always like her until they develop their kick and timing enough to start shooting accurately on those set plays. Yubin and some others are there but Tak is new and IMO those are wasted corner kicks and possessions to kick to her. I'd much rather swap her for Kyoung Seo so if BDream's set piece is to pass it to the mid-field, the one kicking it is Kyoung Seo. If the play goes wrong Kyoung Seo is one of the fastest players in the league so I don't think they'd be meaningfully weaker than having it be Tak, their main defender. Not to mention they have the best goalie who can handle her own. \n10. That Yea Won goal was great. What she did was really nice and you can't call all that beginners luck. Going on a charge like that, not messing up dribbling the ball downfield, getting past a defender and then accurately shooting the ball? It clearly wasn't done from experience of repping that drill x1000 times but she nailed it. Bravo to her!!   \nBummer for Minseo because that's the price of playing so confident and aggressive as a goalie. She was far from the goal and honestly she should have been a bit more conservative given how fast both Yea Won and Euddeum are. They don't have to be that skilled to use their speed and kick the ball well enough for it to roll past you and be a goal. \n11. WOW! SFighter won. Not just that but they beat BDream. Wow. My final analysis is that BDream ran up against an unexpected brick wall. The goalie was shockingly good, the center back is good, and the offensive players did a good job helping on defense. BDream, especially Kyoung Seo, had really bad luck in terms of accuracy and the opposing goalie getting everything right. Lastly, the athleticism and very vocal hwaighting spirit, were factors as well. BDream has always been the more finesse and technical (skill-based) team and that going against said athletic, loud, tough, and defensively schemed team is their Achilles heel. There wasn't much space to pass, it was hard to break through their players and when they did get shots off, they weren't that accurate or the goalie blocked um. \n12. I will openly admit that I was wrong in my thinking about SFighter. I'm not saying they're going to win more against other teams built differently or anything but they can clearly hang with at least some of the Challenge league teams. They got their first win (against BDream!) from their first game and it took Anaconda how long to get theirs? I'm so excited to see what they look like going forward against other teams. I'm also hopeful that BDream will get back to normal against teams that aren't so heavily defensive schematically. BDream is still my fav team so I'm rooting hard for them to get to the Super League. \n13.

Ummmm are we seeing a legendary GK in the making? She is killing it. She's already better than some other teams' GKs. She's like the Heo Kyung Hee of GKs lol. Best debut match by a GK ever i think? My jaw dropped at the first fingertip block.\n\nI'm so impressed how much SF increased their stamina in just one month. They were dying after 5 min at their first game. And now people are questioning how they never seem to get tired.\n\nOmg YW apologizing constantly then tearing up over KM's injury was so cute \n\nEuddeum is so great at reading set pieces! \n\nI'm honestly shocked it stayed 0:0 for so long. \n\nOmg when CJC picked up YW after their first goal \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d so sweet \n\nWeek dieter is already a god tier GK in her first game. I can't wait to see her growth throughout the season. At this rate SF has a great shot at getting promoted to the super league.\n\nMy mind is blown by the result!!!!!\n\nWhat a great first game of the season! CJC really whipped these rookies into shape, I am astounded. He even gave them a 110/100 \ud83d\ude2d",

Brilliant coaching by Jin Chul watching him teach the team defense and seeing practice translate on field should feel rewarding. Still a long ways to develop, hope they stay motivated. One of my pet peeves watching this show is whenever someone cries and the game isn't nearly over. \n\nInexcusable loss for BD. No need for the coaching decision to bring the goalie out. That cost them the game and Jin Chul predicted their tendency correctly. \n\nNext weeks preview: I predict a TM win but rooting for TG. Last week I noted Dayoung seemed like she improved and the other coaches noticed as well. I really hope so because it's been a one woman show there with Bo kyung. Both teams look like they've finally turned a corner in their development. The TG goalie is overrated and only looks good cuz of Yubin.",

Tak as the primary defender since the previous member left, left a huge hole on the defense.  There were a couple of times, I questioned does the goalie need to come out all the way to the front? If it was an experienced team, they would probably scored on them multiple times.  Havent seen Kassy enough to know her actual skill.  Should Tak be goalie instead?\n\nAll I can say about SF, is that they shocked me, esp the goalie.  Wise choice for Jin Chul to put her as goalie than defender, since she lacks stamina and speed.  My heart is with BD but I like Jin Chul as a coach so much. ugh",

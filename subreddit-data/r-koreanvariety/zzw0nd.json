    "postText": "(Spoilers for recent romance variety shows)\n\nSo maybe it's just me, but in a lot of recent romance shows, especially throughout this year. So many characters go through these persistent one sided crushes, I'm curious what's your opinion about them in general, cause some of them get pretty questionable. Which causes more annoyance at the fact some (Mostly Eden, possibly Pink lie) are scripted.\n\n\nBest examples of recent I can give (might be more haven't watched all the shows recently)(also sorry if I butcher names)\n\nSingles Infero \n\nSo-e --&gt; Yoong Jae and Jungwoo  --&gt; Seulki\n\nEden 2\n\nSoomin ---&gt; Lana and Chaehee --&gt; Eogeon\n\nLove Catcher in Bali\n\nSeung Yeon ---&gt; Soo ro\n\nPink Lie\n\nSeo Hanui --&gt; Hong Hanu",

It\u2019s more like \u2018almost every\u2019 dating show has at least 1 character like that. \n\nA lot of people (mostly in asia) really like and try to root for that kind of character.\n\nThere are still some unbearable ones though. You already know who i meant",

He was &gt;!lucky Ji Yeon chose him back!&lt;, but if not, he would have been on par with CH and SM of Eden 2.\n\nOther than that, i think most of them are bearable for entertainment and even some really lovely: &gt;!Jung Kwon, Hye Seon!&lt; from Transit Love 1 and &gt;!Hyun Gyu!&lt; from Transit love 2 (kinda)",

Whereas if the recipient is doing well with a partner or getting to know some reciprocally, the cringe gets to be too much. Also, hyungyu from TL2 is just objectively (at least from Korean standards) an extremely attractive man, so he definitely benefits from that too.\n\nIt\u2019s just so weird sometimes\u2026 I think it\u2019s so funny how there\u2019s all these random, unspoken, subconscious variables that impact how people/the audience respond to an action. Which could be the same action, but are received differently based on the context, who\u2019s doing it, how they do it. Humans are weird, huh? Haha I think that\u2019s why I have an endless fascination with reality dating shows, even though they are often highly scripted and edited.",

I have nothing against her. Jungwoo is frustrating to watch, but from what I remember he was also never clearly rejected. We have to remember that those people are 10/10 in there everyday life + they are on an island for a week and don't see what we see. That's why they might dismiss subtle signs and need a clear rejection to move on. If they continue pushing after they get the rejection, I already move them to the category of tiring.",

            "comment": "It seems like many contestants meet one person they like and put on horse blinders for the rest of the show. It's frustrating to watch and makes little sense at first but I think we need to try and understand a few things.\n\n1. Each of the contestants spent their lives being the most attractive person in the room. They go to some island and suddenly there is a top, middle, and bottom of the pack. Imagine going from a total stud/hottie to being ignored and on the bottom in a few days. The contestants only have a short time to adjust.\n2. The contestants usually succeed in romantic pursuits. Even the least popular girl, So-e, said she never failed to get the guy in her intro. Given their history, I can see why they firmly believe they can succeed as long as they don't give up.\n3. Many of the contestants are young and/or inexperienced. Their emotions are swinging rapidly in a short period of time and many of them don't have the experience or ability to control their feelings in such a foreign and unnatural situation.\n4. Persistence is heavily romanticized, especially in Korea. There's some idea that being true and faithful is this noble pursuit that will pay off in the end. Think of all the Korean dramas that go like this: ep1-2 fated meeting, ep2-10 ML pursues FL but is rejected repeatedly, ep11-12 they get together, ep13-14 fighting the mother-in-law, ep15-16 happy ending.\n\nI like to imagine if I were on the show I would strategize better and meet everyone before seriously pursing anyone, but that's just my armchair analysis. If put in the same situation, I doubt I could control my emotions like that.\n\n(I've only seen Singles Inferno so I'm not sure my commentary applies to other shows.)",

But if you combine points 1 and 2 with 4 it makes a lot of sense.\n\nFor point 3 I think it just depends tbh. Some younger gen in these are actually quite mature, Nadine from singles inferno being a good example. But inexperience is definitely a factor, especially for some of the older cast in these shows.",

This fixation behavior screams inexperience, specifically with rejections and breakups. As a person who has been through many tens of rejections in my life I would sit down and think, \u201cThis isn\u2019t working out with X, I should stop my feelings towards X and consider one of the other gorgeous and amazing contestants who I could be very happy with if I just gave them a chance.\u201d That\u2019s the rational calculation, but it\u2019s not what the heart desires. Not being able to get X often increases desire and makes it even harder to stop.\n\nThis kind of emotional control is not easy and is a skill that you learn and develop with experience. I was a complete mess trying to control my romantic feelings from 14-22, pretty bad at 22-25, getting better 25-28, and pretty good at 33.

But that's what gripes a lot of people with the show.\n\nI've been in one-sided crushes with many noonas while younger girls or same age girls would also be crushing on me. Yup, I'm just an average-looking guy that maybe excelled at academics and sports and so on, lol. It's perhaps not a nice situation in real life, because for me I'm a boy and so I can't really do much.\n\nEspecially since everyone (these situations often happen in school or other similar shared environments) knew that I liked this particular noona/oneesan/jiejie/ate/etc. Like everyone in her grade and also my grade and then below. Sad times when you're paralyzed by public view.\n\nAnd so like even though everyone knew I liked the pretty noona who buys me food, lol, those other girls would proceed anyway, despite something in the rain.\n\n---\n\nSo for example, umm, I was propositioned several times but ya for the most part it was just your typical requests for attention. Like they'd ask me for my pencil, sharpener, French skills, math help, wait it seems I'm writing euphemisms but it's true (exaggerated), holy, lmao.\n\nSometimes they'd outright tease me with that noona when she's nearby. Or like they'd flirt with me inside and outside of school, like even in our after school programs or like my own apartment building, lol.\n\nI actually had this weird situation where me and this girl talked for like hours (about random/casual/etc. things) past midnight and so on, but I didn't know a classmate/neighbor of mine was actually setting me up with this girl. Because she was in public school and I was in (also public but considered different) Catholic school. Umm, I even went to movies with her but I was so dense and had no idea.\n\nThat same classmate/neighbor of mine also set me up with this other girl from also the same public school (it's the main other school in our neighborhood), and then for that one we also talked for hours. \n\nAnd like we met at my foyer/lobby with that same classmate/neighbor of mine from before. And get this: they directly asked me if I was interested in dating her but then remember, I had this one-sided (or not, unrequited love is confusing) crush with this other particular noona and so yup, I just laughed it off.\n\n---\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that, I can understand. Like why if they fell in love or caught feelings due to the time dilation, overwhelming, fast-paced, etc. environment of the dating shows. That they'd be persistent.\n\nFor me, I literally just gawked or caught glances of my noona crush. Because yes, it was awkward for both of us even though we were chill before. Literally everyone knew or it seemed so. \n\nAnd so like we barely got to interact and she graduated earlier than me. We lived in the same neighborhood, but ya she chose like the opposite side of the city for her next school. And then for me, I was on the other side, figuratively and literally.\n\nHer choice to go to that school kinda ended my crush for her (mainly since we essentially never saw each other again), but it also changed how our destinies be. For her, she naturally became a nurse, I mean Pinoy kami so iyon ang pinili niya, halos kalahati ng mga tita at pinsan ko ay nurse. Though I heard these days that she's on some dark, and I mean real dark side of the world type of thing where she's associated with people/situations in the news, public or otherwise.\n\nEvery now and then I wonder if had we dated, could I have saved her from her current circumstances. It's like a savior complex sometimes.\n\nBut ya, it's all about timing, and how to seize it or go with the flow.\n\nThere's different standards, expectations, et cetera, and so how you proceed will be varied, especially with the numerous variables available. Especially when maybe the producers will incentivize people to act a certain way.\n\n---\n\nLike yes, sometimes during the casting phase and so on, producers will pick people that have a high chance of being strict with pursuing only one person. And so they create conditions for love triangles, tangled situations, etc. to sorta spontaneously spawn.\n\nThough ya irrationally or not, it's just how it be for people that did or didn't know they'd be susceptible to the idea of love at first sight (or after some intensified emotional development due to the hastened environment of dating shows). Some people can't really explain it, it's all a mystery.\n\nThere's **UnREAL with Rachel or Shiri Appleby** for western/Anglo/American/etc. dating shows or shows like The Bachelor.\n\n**Love is for Suckers** (has Lee Da-hee, one of the panelists of Single's Inferno (2), as the producer or main character there) is a more modern Korean drama version, it just finished almost exactly a month ago now. It'll show you how Korean/East Asian dating shows are created.\n\nKingdom of Love 2 (the dating reality show inside Love is for Suckers) is mainly based around probably I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO (/r/IamSolo) and so on, like if you watch I Am Solo you'll see familiar stuff, references, et cetera.\n\nIf you want to skip the drama and go straight behind the curtain for how dating shows are made, start at Episode 5/6 of Love is for Suckers as that's when they actually begin the Kingdom of Love 2 dating show, lol.\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and more info on where to watch them: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zyn2y0/regarding_the_popularity_of_the_different_dating/j2a8bok/**",

As they are falling in love with people in a week you are falling for them for a month with a hour of time. Only difference they can't use the internet to stalk who they like in the house. They actually spend time with the people they like.",

It's the persistence even after a verbally clear rejection that causes a lot of the issues.\n\nAlso, if you're coming on a reality tv show, you are essentially asking to be judged.",

The idea that we need to suppress our wants, needs, likes or love to not not make another person feel burden is ridiculous. Now the problem that I have is where those expression actaully cause harm such as stalking and threatning.\n\nThe persistence in my mind is normal becuase this is a dating show. I scream like everyone else for the people to get clue and move on. However I also think about when I liked someone and how long it took me to get over them. In the position they are in; looking at some one else is difficult when your waking and sleeping with the person you like everyday until the show is over. \n\nI have more to say but need to organize my thoughts a bit more.",

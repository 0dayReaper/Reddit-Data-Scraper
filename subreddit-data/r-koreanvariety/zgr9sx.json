    "postText": "Haven't seen any new posts discussing this upcoming travel show but it's officially airing Dec. 11 on MBC, titled Adventure by Accident (\ud0dc\uc5b4\ub09c \uae40\uc5d0 \uc138\uacc4\uc77c\uc8fc). I see it's on Kocowa with english subtitles for the trailers. \n\nKian84, Lee Si Eon, Pani Bottle (korean youtuber) travel to South America. Simon Dominic, Mino (Winner) and Jang Do Yeon will be on the MC panel. PD is from I live Alone so guess it's kinda why most of the cast is from that show. Looking forward to seeing Kian84 and Lee Si Eon together again.",

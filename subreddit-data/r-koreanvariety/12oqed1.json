    "postText": "&gt;What if Paik Jong Won suddenly gets dropped off in a completely new country? Paik Jong Won is the top restaurateur in Korea. However, if he were to find himself in a country on the other side of the world where they don\u2019t know anything about Korean food, will he be able to run a business and survive? In a place where he doesn\u2019t speak the language and has no popularity to rely on, he must build a business from the ground up. Nothing is scripted and everything is one-hundred percent real. Will Paik Jong Won be able to reach world-class fame with his food business? The story of the Business Genius\u2019 new store opening begins now.\n\nCast:\n\n* Baek Jong Won\n* Lee Jang Woo\n* John Park\n* Yuri\n* BamBam\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Info/Torrent|Stream|Subtitles|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|[Here](https://torrentsee159.com/topic/281253)|[VIU](https://www.viu.com/ott/ph/en/vod/2125354/The-Genius-Paik)|[Yes](https://files.catbox.moe/apvlm3.srt)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I was not ready for that. 45+ minutes of making a simple dish on a flat top as BamBam constantly welcomes people and tells the price while the local asks them if they like it, which they always do... it got stale. So them moving and things looking, in the preview, like they get spicy in Italy is nice. I'm hopeful for a more traditional kitchen setup like in the shows previews (when Yuri is with them) where you can get more back-kitchen staff interactions (chatting, banter, etc).",

All it would have been is busier which means more BamBam welcoming + telling the price and more of the local shepherding people in the dining area and asking them if they liked it. Just like episode 2 peak timing. All while every single guest said they like it. \n\nIt's the unfortunately reality of the language barrier. They can't chat or conversate with the guests or they are stuck at their stations, saying \"hello/bye/thank you/no/yes\" in a mixture of ENG and KOR. That's why I am looking forward to the possibility that in Italy there will be a kitchen with Yuri and Jang Woo in it and we'll get scenes of them working while conversing and bantering. Mix in some BamBam back there too and that sounds like a good way to inject some fun scenes between the monotony.",

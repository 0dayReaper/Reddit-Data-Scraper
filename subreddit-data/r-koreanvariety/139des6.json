We don't even know how is their relationship in the next episodes. He just tilted so hard and cant think straight after a bad game from his side. I don't think people who are malding can control themselves (hence, his actions and also slurs and Physiognomy stuff came out from him lmao). I don't know why people forget that fact this happened because of the show's design; the PD team just wanted to see the cast' ugliest side, and Seungjin took the bait (even though the game is over). They even dispatch an onsite cameraman to take a better angle than the guards to de-escalate the situation lmao",

Had this happened during the game sure keep rolling but have security on standby just in case worst scenario happens. Dex was literally a former UDT soldier so if he put his mind to it I don't doubt he could do serious damage even to someone like HSJ, so just out of concern to the cast members I'd have medical and security ready to break it up. The incident taking place AFTER the game as well, and no one stepping in is infuriating. Because to me surely the production saw the incident happen and were fully aware of what COULD happen, since they incited and encouraged violence, that maybe someone could get hurt. God forbid, one of the girls just get caught up and traumatized actually when 2 guys just go at it you know.",

Half of the show is just your typical \"play games for money with politics and but still in a cool new house\" and the other is \"fuck the other guys have it so easy while we have to struggle I can't wait to make them go through what I went through\". Then you have the setup for an interesting this vs that side, while still maintaining internal issues between groups and even amongst individuals. I just think in particular the PD really did them dirty by very specifically saying any use of force is allowed since that's an outright encouragement of ruining your own image. I think most people would agree Pi's knee was still within the \"rules\" of the game but surely that drags her already bad image even further down as an example.",

I thought there would be a good reason he got THAT angry. \n\nAfter watching the episode and the review, I just can't understand Seungjin's actions at all. Dex was on the other team, their whole mission was to destroy the symbol and they could use any possible method?! It makes no sense that Seungjin would get mad, even if Dex really did celebrate. \n\nTBH, I think he really did try to apologize in the video and it seems that he and Dex are fine now... but if I were his fan, this would definitely be a mark against him.",

I get being annoyed your teammates failed and got tricked. But he's a hypocrite as he was backstabbing Yurisa few hours earlier. \n\nIt was clearly always going to happen because these games always do scheming but he got super angry when his team lost.

He got his ego all hurt and was showing off to the women about how big and strong he is. Kept provoking other people to just \"try him\" and see what happens. It's one of the most immature shit I've ever seen on TV, it's honestly mind boggling to me that Dex didn't lose his cool and pull out his knife or something. I know I would've. Big props to Dex tho it was a smooth af move.",

    "postText": "On December 23rd 2022, the happy wedding scene of Park Soo-hong and Kim Da-Ae was revealed. The couple completed their marriage registration in July of last year and have already legally become husband and wife. However, due to the aftermath of Covid 19 and issues surrounding Park Soo-hong, the wedding was postponed.\n\nPark Soo-hong also revealed wedding invitations through his YouTube channel \"Black Cat Da-hong.\" The invitation read, \"As we went through the difficult times of our lives together, the two of us became stronger. For those who have experienced the same difficulties, I will live well so that I can show you a happy side. Please bless Da-hong, the two of us, and our new family.'\n\nKBS2's entertainment program 'Fun Restaurant', which aired on the evening of his wedding, released wedding photos taken against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Park Soo-hong recalled the time and said, \"I said, 'I have no regrets even if I die now,' and my wife said she thought the same thing.\" He also said, \"When my wife and I are having a hard time, just like a false dream, 'Let's go to Paris later on.' \"But I really took a wedding photo in Paris,\" he said, recalling the difficult two years. \"It was a miraculous moment. I'm really happy.\"\n\nPark Soo-hong's best friends and celebrities from the entertainment industry came together to make their wedding reminiscent of an awards ceremony.\n\nPart 1 of the wedding was hosted by Son Hun-soo and part 2 by Boom. Park Gyeong-rim and Kim Soo-yong greeted the arriving guests (normally it would be parents/ relatives doing so, as Park Soo hong's parents and siblings were absent as expected). Guests included Yoo Jae-seok, Kang Ho-dong, Ji Seok-jin, Kim Kook-jin and Kang Su-ji couple, Oh Na-mi, Lee Yeon-bok, Joo Young-hoon, Jang Seong-gyu, Lee Soo-young, Kim Min-seok, Lee Chan-won, Jo Hye-ryun, Kim In-seok, Lee Dong-woo, and Choi Seong-guk.\n\nFor photos &amp; sources: \n\n[https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/ranking/article/477/0000401721](https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/ranking/article/477/0000401721)\n\n[https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/ranking/article/109/0004762496](https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/ranking/article/109/0004762496)\n\n[https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/ranking/article/312/0000587192](https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/ranking/article/312/0000587192)\n\nEdit: format &amp; papago translator errors\n\nMore photos/articles: [https://www.allkpop.com/article/2022/12/stunning-additional-photos-from-park-soo-hongs-wedding-have-been-released](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2022/12/stunning-additional-photos-from-park-soo-hongs-wedding-have-been-released)\n\n[https://www.allkpop.com/article/2022/12/park-soo-hong-reveals-his-wedding-photos-for-the-first-time](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2022/12/park-soo-hong-reveals-his-wedding-photos-for-the-first-time)\n\n[https://www.allkpop.com/article/2022/12/park-soo-hongs-close-friends-comedian-kim-soo-yong-and-park-kyung-lim-said-to-have-acted-as-the-wedding-hosts-in-place-of-park-soo-hongs-family](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2022/12/park-soo-hongs-close-friends-comedian-kim-soo-yong-and-park-kyung-lim-said-to-have-acted-as-the-wedding-hosts-in-place-of-park-soo-hongs-family)\n\n[https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/ranking/article/108/0003115944](https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/ranking/article/108/0003115944)\n\n[https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/ranking/article/468/0000910151](https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/ranking/article/468/0000910151)\n\n[https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/ranking/article/076/0003953807](https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/ranking/article/076/0003953807)",

It's actually the last 15 minutes (starting about 57:48) where actor Lee Dong Wook, Joon Park (from g.o.d.) and Japanese actor Ryohei Otani visit a temple and share a meal with a monk. [Link](https://www.bilibili.tv/en/video/2040599711)\n\nDream Team vs 2PM dance battle is pretty good too, it's on Youtube ( Wooyoung dancing to Beyonce's Single Ladies is the best).",

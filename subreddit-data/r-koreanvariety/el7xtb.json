I knew from watching his Youtube vlogs that he was slowly becoming more comfortable with this phase of his life, and he did say he was only taking a break from entertainment.\n\nAnd beyond all that, he's got a cute kid and seems like a great dad, so seeing more of that interaction should make for good TV!",

Even if the dads got some gigs, it's always coupled with their children.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, if Gary really want to make a CB to variety , I thought he will choose project that will highlight him better and him joining ROTS basically contradicted his previous stance about his privacy.\n\nAlthough I do understand why Gary choose ROTS, it's popular and stable show,  relatively easy show to do and paid well .\n\nI think he need release music / join other show soon, otherwise sceptical comments about \"him coming back because he just want quick cash after running out of money\" will keep following him.",

I would also say that the fathers are just as famous as their kids and anyone who watches the shows the emphasis is just as much on the dads as on their children. \n\nRoS is also known for allowing fathers who have been in the dark to rise up again and that's why it's so popular among stars as well.",

I know he had to take care of his newborn but he still had time for other projects and now 3 months after the release of a new song he is making a comeback to variety. But I'm glad that he is back and that he is doing well",

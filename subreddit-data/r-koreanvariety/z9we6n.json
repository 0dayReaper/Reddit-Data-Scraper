    "postText": "The Dictionary of Useless Human Knowledge is starting a new season on TVN on 12/02 at 8:40pm kst, and I can't figure out where I'd be able to watch it or even if it will be subtitled in English. I was hoping the folks in this subreddit might be able to point me in the right direction or share what expectations I should have in regards to availability outside of South Korea. \n\nHere's a [teaser](https://youtu.be/kcZXQ3ld-Vk) about the main cast meeting and getting to know each other.\n\nAny assistance would be appreciated! Thank you!!",

It requires some cultural and scientific knowledge to even translate most of the stuff outside of what RM talks about. Maybe I'm underestimating BTS fan base but this is mostly an intellectual show that requires more than \"common\" level of Korean to sub this show. I had to papago a few words to understand what was going on every once in a while.",

I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re available with English subs, but some prominent sub groups in China have subbed them for anyone who knows Chinese. This show is a really good introduction to ppl who are interested in Korean history, literature, and culture beyond K-pop. But yeah the translation seemed grueling and the show itself is a little too dense for casual viewing, and by the 3rd season most Chinese sub groups had dropped it. In this respect I think a dedicated fan community definitely has more motivation than a general sub group to work on this show. Also the BTS fan base is huuugggeee, there are definitely more than enough people who are well versed in these areas to translate (I say this as a non-Army).\n\nSo I\u2019m actually really happy that RM joined the show, as it means that many more people will contribute to subbing it \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c",

As a fan of BTS and RM specifically, Kim Namjoon has exposed fans to so much art and literature through his lyricism in his music and by sharing his interests through social media. Even if it might be challenging to understand the nuances, that's something most international fans are used to; we understand that we'll never fully know or understand all the meanings of their lyrics for example. That doesn't stop us from enjoying and appreciating what we do understand.",

I'm glad they at least had their fill before the exhausting games. You can see how serious they were to avoid the punishments. Still the fun remains starting with Dindin's premonition and futile escape, the guard tripping over the sand, and Inwoo's accurate versus Seonho's confusing charades.",

The latter turned out to be &gt;!bad at charades!&lt; whereas the category NIW chose brought out the best in him.\n\nThe &gt;!loud echoing from KJM on the slide!&lt; both times are so amusing, I sort of want to make them into ringtones \ud83e\udd23",

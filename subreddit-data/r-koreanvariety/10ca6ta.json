So many variety shows on TV already are either 100% men or &gt;75% men and then they release more shows that are entirely men. \n\nWhere are the Gamsung camping type shows? The mixed gender shows? \n\nYawn.",

They where beheaded by islamic crazy men and it was filmed. You can tent but maybe not anywhere. Spain is famous for having tvieves who puts carbonmonoxide in RV's. I wouldn't tent anywhere in Spain. I would travel and tent in northern Europe without a hesitation. The rest are risks I wouldn't put myself in cause I'm not stupid and will complain, in hindsight, that I was wronged. Corrupt police, rape, human trafficking etc.. Weakest are the easiest to prey on.",

This year he really carried the show, even when he was alone in the show, he managed to make it funny and fun to watch. It's insane how KJM gets funnier every year.\n\nReally happy DinDin finally won his Top Excellence award, I have been waiting for this for so long.

One of Immortal song MC Lee Chan won is a trot singer with a dedicated fandom so maybe that's why Immortal songs got more votes. Plus Korean fans said something went wrong with the voting process.\n\nWhat message KBS want to send to 2D1N, care to elaborate? 2D1N and SBS Miusae are the only public broadcast shows that got double digit ratings, so if you mean the message to scrap the show without any solid reasons, I don't think it is.",

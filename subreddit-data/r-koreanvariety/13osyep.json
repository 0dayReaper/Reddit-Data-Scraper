And that's because of this controversy. Even when she appeared for one episode after the date (along with her mother in the studio), she was just trying to put on a show and nothing else. \n\nEspecially after the departure of HJ and her sister, they thought they would get a spot on a show but due to the criticism it didn't work out and I think it happened for the best. Because now due to too many comedians, this show is already drifted from its original plot.",

The episode was so much fun and I'm so glad they managed to align their schedules to do this tour and film the show.\n\nI love watching the rehearsals and practices and how much they highlight their teams, who stand behind it. I still can't believe Hyori gathered her old team from 20 years ago, wow. Can't wait for more performances next week!",

    "postText": "I couldn't find a place to discuss the episodes individually so let me know if this is the wrong place. I've only finished the 2nd episode so far. No spoilers, please.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut the episode 2 game was SO FRUSTRATING to watch!! The only redeeming quality was the checkout battle with &gt;!NamHee getting eliminated due to her cockiness.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I hope the 3 spies grow a backbone &amp; stop getting intimidated by the \"super team\". I know Chloe &amp; Layone are playing the middle which is a viable strategy, but seeing how that whole game went down was frustrating to watch. Don't even know what Hyunkyu was doing. I wasn't even an EonKyu fan till it was revealed the whole cast banded together against him, except for Jiyeon.!&lt;\n\nI'd have to say the biggest L of the episode goes to Nam Hee for squandering all the advantages she got as the previous winner &amp; making it so obvious that she was excluding certain players. She had a good understanding of game mechanics, but her overconfidence made her seem like the \"enemy\" to the outside members. Also couldn't convince her alliance to give her safety! She was literally running all the calculations for them &amp; should have insisted to receive safety. During the checkout match, she kept talking to herself &amp; revealing clues for Eun Kyu to use against her. I think she is more perceptive than self-aware and that is probably what cost her the game. Also, minor L to Jinho since his sole game purpose was to eliminate Eonkyu but couldn't manage it himself (+ whole super team lost their bet). Also, he spooked other players with his cutthroat energy (which I like). But the rest of the cast doesn't have the same experience so it feels like he revealed himself as game savvy too early. What happened to his \"I want to fly under the radar\" strategy?\n\nBiggest winners of the episode are probably Layone (for not getting suspected as a spy) &amp; John Park (for gaining enough of NamHee's trust to get special info, pulling in Jin Ho to make the super alliance &amp; his team handing him the win). Also props to Eun Kyu, despite getting targetted by the \"top players\", he kept his cool during the checkout battle and used outside-the-box strategies (observing Nam Hee's hand movement + memorizing how much time she took) to win the battle. Hope next week he leans into his suspicions of Chloe and shifts his game plan. No matter how good he does in checkout battles, if all participants are against you, you'll stay at the bottom till you leave.\n\nCan't say much about Jeseong but it's a good sign that he's shown to still hang out with people outside his alliance. During meal times he didn't stay alone at the big table (...NamHee) and the opposition openly discussed their plans in front of him. Hope to see more of Jiyeon next episode, she was the only other person left out during the game but we don't know if she suspected any of her \"alliance\" members yet",

This is why Jinho struggled quite a lot in the Genius, he basically had to win a ton of last chance games because no one liked him.\n\nSang Min by comparison very clearly understood how important it was to crack jokes and blend in with the other contestants trying to be friends with the other players so that they wouldn\u2019t choose him as a target. \n\nSang Min would offer advice to basically everyone in the game, and he would set things in motion secretly to influence the games. He\u2019d gladly let other people take credit for his ideas. \n\nJinho on the otherhand plays each game like its his last and devises a plan then attempts to convince enough people to follow his plan. This type of dictatorship worries not only the outsiders/enemies but it also worries Jinho\u2019s own team mates because they are afraid that Jinho would stab them in the back if he needed to.",

But her lack of self-awareness really hurt her game. And I definitely think Jin Ho also mishandled the social aspect, though to a lesser extent. It's frustrating to watch when players don't realize the importance of social skills in this game. Nonetheless, I'm excited to see how the rest of the season plays out!",

            "comment": "I feel like Eun Kyu misplayed the main game. At some point he had to know he was being specifically targeted, so he should've used the threat of the deathmatch/checkout against the 4 person team to save him. At least two of them were going to be safe with the pass, but the other two had a target on their back, so it would've been in their best interests to keep Eun Kyu alive and secretly take out someone else.\n\nNam Hee should've realised this point sooner. She painted the biggest target on her back from the start of the suite benefits and should've played into more fluid alliances, especially with Eun Kyu.",

I recognize he's not good at the main strategies but it seemed like no one outside of the top 4 understood either. I guess knowing the game in advance really made a big difference",

It's stressful like I get the idea of betting the chips plus the alliance with betrayal.  \n\n\nSo yeah initially I watched the show for Monika but she was the 1st eliminated ahhaha. Looking forward who will be the top 3. I mean I thought Namhee will make it but nah she messed up immediately while Eonkyu didn't last long. Both of them are both cocky in different spectrum.   \n\n\nOverall, exciting show damn hahaha",

But I\u2019m still curious if she has some family connections.\nUnlike shows like I am Solo, it seems like it will be very impressive to get on an exclusive show like time Hotel",

And at the end the only thing that saved him was a last minute decision by Chloe who just happened to be a key flip piece with a powerful reversal at her disposal - he completely lost on strategy and seemed to just be flailing most of the time. He played the checkout game well but also I thought his idea of reading the time and movements was very shallow and easy to bluff. He's mostly lucky it turned out the way it did.\n\nStill, enjoying the show a lot and looking forward to the next few eps!",

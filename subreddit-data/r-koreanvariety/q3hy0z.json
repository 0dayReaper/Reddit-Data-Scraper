    "postText": "# An interview with Jeong Chul-min PD.\n\n*(rough translation)*  \n\n\n&gt;*The anticipation for season 3 is already high. Producer Jeong Chul-min raised expectations for the program by saying, \"I will return as soon as possible.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*We will do our best to come back with season 3 as soon as possible. Thank you so much to the viewers for giving so much love that season 3 was even mentioned, and to everyone who liked the 'Sixth Sense' YouTube video a lot. I will live hard.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n* Compared the cast to a football (soccer) team.\n\n&gt;*Jae-seok-hyung is a midfielder who is in charge of airlifting. I think of him as an all-weather midfielder who catches the overall flow and sometimes attacks others and gets attacked by himself. Somin is a fast winger. He has a sense of humor and he hits well. Jesse is a goal scorer. He's a player with a shot that always makes you expect a 'goal'. \u2018Mijoo\u2019 is a striker who has completely established himself as a key player from a promising prospect. He's been creating 'goals' when he kicks. Nara is a defensive midfielder with a long shot. He gets the most out of the way and bursts out once in a while. Sangyeop is a goalkeeper. He doesn't seem to have a big presence when he's attacking, but he's an indispensable player. Because the striker trusts the goalkeeper and just rushes forward.*\n\n* Spoke about Sangyeob's addition to the cast.\n\n&gt;*He came out as a guest in Season 1 of The Sixth Sense and showed off his charm to the fullest. I thought that there should be a fixed member that differentiates from the guests, but I think that Lee Sang-yeop is the member that differentiates from guests the most. I think he did a good job playing the so-called 'tanker' role. As Sangyeop took the attack with his whole body, Jaesuk hyung had a bit of a breather, so Jaesuk hyung had time to counterattack the female members in Season 2.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Sometimes, when Sangyeop does some gags, the atmosphere quickly cools down. But it's not because it's not fun, it's because there are times when something happens. When Sangyeop speaks, the microphone suddenly turns off, or the surrounding construction noise gets worse. I'm thinking it's not a \"cold water\" character from the sky.*\n\n* Production for season 2 cost more than season 1. \n\n&gt;*The production cost increased slightly as we moved to Friday's programming.*\n\n* It is diffucult for them to get female guests on the show.\n\n&gt;*He said, \"Actually, we made several phone calls to female celebrities, but they were all rejected. They said that it can feel like going to a girls' high school alone, so it can be burdensome.\" , Nam Ji-hyun is really a real 'Sixth Sense' fan, and he really wanted to appear, so it's memorable.\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[http://naver.me/FrKmQjHY](http://naver.me/FrKmQjHY)\n\n[http://naver.me/GC2erlGK](http://naver.me/GC2erlGK)",

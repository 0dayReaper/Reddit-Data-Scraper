Honestly tho I think if only all 4 of them (stunt team) stayed on top of the roof the day they got eliminated then 4 v 8 would still be doable. I watched that episode and saw 2 of them easily get taken out by 6 people and I thought what is the point of having 2 people down there?",

They barricaded the door but that was useless if both of them are already dead. They are too arrogant to think they can take on 8 people. At the very least they could have gone inside once they run out of fog cover. Besides since they just wanted to buy time they could have just defended inside the cabin and used the fire extinguishers once the door was broken down. This plus the unsportmanlike conduct really disappointed me. They butchered an easy win and played terribly, I know they were the favorites but they just deserved to be eliminated.\n\nBase fight 4\n\nTeam ff and athlete just have a better grasp of the game and have better cooperation, their members are not only individually skilled but have superior teamwork over team soldier and guard. They deserve to be the finalists cause none of the other 4 teams came close to them. \n\nFinals\n\nI was rooting for team ff but the moment they went 3v4 against the best defense base and against atheletes who grapple for a living, I knew they would lose. If they wanted to go out with a bang they should have just gone full force, and what was the point of living someone in that hiding spot that your former allies already know about? Anyway I think athlete got this either way, they just have more fighting experience and better base.",

On the other hand, team athlete do their part but they also go along with the flow so that they can ensure they will be one of the finalists. And once they are in the final, it is basically guaranteed that they will win... Like come on, these people thrives in 1v1 situations.

I like how unpredictable they were but their dirty actions were too much and thanks the production team that they penalized the soldiers. \n\nSadly, they didn\u2019t have a reliable ally. After a few base battles, you can kinda see that unless you are defending from the top, it is hard to fight in 2:1 situations, so soldiers had no chance. \n\nI commended ff leader on being a reliable leader for her team and the alliance, but agree that she was reckless. They could have used their three house advantage but instead keep the flag where everyone knew. \n\nAlso, with ff and athletes alliance, it is pretty obvious that athletes are the stronger one. When the judo girl climbed up and took down stunt girl, so they can capture the flag, was one of the best scenes imo. At the end we might be able to conclude that it might be best to do full defense and try to take all of opponent\u2019s flags, then do the offense later, especially in the situation that you are outnumbered\u2026",

Like when they were taking down team stunt, that wouldn't of been possible without team athletes abilities like rock climbing and judo. Team firefighter was not successful on their own, as we saw in the first episode when they tried to take on team police and got eliminated. Overall, team athlete had the largest variety of different skills with all of them being strong and useful in their own ways. Where team firefighter only had 2 strong teammates.",

Lots of play actually can be used by the recon that she actually got. When she got Intel of how the leaders of Firefighters get hurt, the soldier team can use it as leverage to make alliance to attack the Firefighters early on. The third battle phase,  she actually got the times right but not the am/pm. They should actually take a rest when they found out it isn't the first 8 o'clock.  \n\nIt's kinda sad that the recon is basically useless in this show, having full team of grappler probably would make a stronger team .",

            "comment": "History teacher here. I couldn't help but praise and criticise some of the tactics and strategies employed by the teams. If you will allow me to indulge, I will highlight some of my favourites.\n\n**Team Police**, given their crappy base and member attributes, should have focused solely on defence and building alliances. Team Soldier was always going to target them. They could have lasted if they didn't split their team up in Base Battle 1 and focused solely on defence (2 on windows, 2 on doors) and hope that the allied attackers would change targets\u00a0to the depleted Team FF.\n\n**Team Stunt** were highly capable but splitting up their team to guard a decoy room was a bad idea. Four defenders on high ground would have stopped any attacker. Obi Wan Kenobi and the Turks at Gallipoli are right on this.\n\n**Team Soldier** had clear psychological, strength, and reputational advantages but poor teamwork, defence building and diplomatic skills failed them in the end. They lost my respect at the fire extinguisher throwing, got it back in the consolation game, but lost it with the failed tent defence strategy. Ala Battle of Thermopylae, Team Soldier could have held off 8 attackers if 4 Soldiers were INSIDE the room together, using the door as a chokepoint until Team Guard came to help them. Instead, by splitting their team into 2 defenders and 2 infiltrators, they essentially reduced their defence and attack by 50%. The fire extinguisher would have been more effective in a funnel of a doorway rather than a thrown hunk of metal to take someone's head off.\n\n**Team FF** had the best leadership, comraderie, teamwork, strategies and were lucky to have the best base (Treehouse ranks higher in defence but not luxury). They objectively had the best and most inspiring leader and strategist, supported by their powerhouse who could singlehandedly chop 30 blocks of wood without breaking a sweat. The leader's abrasive personality aside, I loved it when FF channelled Alexander the Great's Battle of Gaugamela by fooling the teams into staying up hungry and awake for over 12 hours, 8pm instead of 8am. I wonder if the overly loud reveal by the FF leader was deliberate knowing they could be overheard. I would be equally scared and glad to have her rescue me from a burning building.\n\n**Team Athlete** were the best allies and most effective close combatants. Once they acquired the Treehouse, they had the best defence, blocking off the ladders and creating decoy flags around the pillars. If 4 of them took the high ground, they would be unassailable. Supported by Team FF's leadership and strategy, Team Athlete's melee prowess made an undefeatable alliance that it was inevitable in a 1-1 fight (let alone the 3-1 showdown), Athletes would win. They're like the over-underestimated Yugoslav Resistance in WW2. These two teams generated the most pathos in the show TBH.\n\n**Team Guard** was demonstratably useless time and time again. They took no initiative to support their allies, build defences or attack the other teams. They relied on Team Soldier for everything. They're basically the Italians in WW1 and 2. It's a good thing these women guard bodies not bases!\n\nConclusion\n\nI'm glad I didn't cancel Netflix after they stopped password sharing (still gripes me though). But this is seriously a great show with 10 equally phenomenal episodes (way better than neverending interviews, uninspiring games, and lacklustre ending of Physical 100) . Korean women are badass and I wish the show format gets exported worldwide so we can have the World Siren Games or something. I am a bit disappointed there was no cash prize for the winners but I guess for Koreans, winning honour for your profession is prizeless.\n\nNice to know though: \"Despite the show having no cash prize, Lee Eun Kyung clarified that the participants were \\[equally\\] compensated for the effort and time that they've put in for the program.\"\n\nAs a long time fan of Running Man, I hope this series continues forever. I can't wait for Season 2! Maybe an urban setting next time? What other teams could they have? (Navy? Air Force? Marines? Gymfluencers? LOL)",

They went into several bad fights, often outnumbered, and it got them in trouble.\n\nTo emphasize, team firefigher was almost eliminated in the first base battle because their leader took them into a 2v3 against a superior opposing position, only to lose their personal flag immediately and leading to another member of their team losing their flag too.\n\nStill my favourite team and leader, but the leaderships was questionable at times.",

Physical one v. one was not always the strong suit and that's where she fell apart, but the way she assessed and commandeered the alliance with the Athletes on the way to Stunt house was actually really well handled. Same with the initial attack on the soldier house, which was certainly going to succeed had the game not stopped. Making smarter decisions slower may have cost her the game, especially since the firefighters were targeted by a few groups right from the jump.",

They got way too arrogant so it was nice to see them get put in their place and &gt;!taken out twice.!&lt;\n\nTeam Guard surviving that long was only really because no one saw them as a threat. The editing didn\u2019t show them as much as other teams, but the way I saw it, they didn\u2019t strategise at all and just relied on Team Soldier to last as long as possible. I wonder how different the competition would have been if they got taken out instead of Team Police or Team Stunt.\n\nI loved seeing the showmanship and camaraderie between Team Firefighter and Team Athlete. I was worried when Team Athlete seemed to be leaning towards allying with Team Soldier before and during the shovelling competition, but afterwards, Team Athlete x Firefighter consolidated their alliance so it was all good! I would have been happy with either of them winning, and it was great to see that neither of them were bitter and accepted the results. &gt;!Team Athlete won because they had technique, a better defensive base, and because Team Firefighter chose to fight fairly rather than resorting to dirty tactics. Team Firefighter put up a good fight, but they couldn\u2019t compete with athletes who grappled for a living.!&lt;\n\nOverall, a great show with great premises.

It was even better because of all the alliances and backstabbing. \n\nWhen I started the show I was rooting for the stunt team, they had tenacity and grit.. but as the show progressed I realised the firefighters and athletes were just better sportsman.. they didn\u2019t have to do any manipulating and played the game fairly. I\u2019m glad the athletes won. They deserved it. EunByul was a star in my books. \n\nMan the first strike for team soldier was when they stood and watched their allies get taken down.. then when they spoke down to the athletes and eventually just the heckling and throwing of the fire extinguisher and on top of that lying. Nothing made me happier than to see them get taken down TWICE! They were too arrogant and proud and I disliked KangMi very much. Props to NaEun though, she\u2019s very good at recon!\n\nAnd lastly team Guard, they had so many days to fortify their base but they did nothing after almost getting the flag in base battle 1. You\u2019d think they\u2019d continue to be proactive if not for anything but to get out of that God forsaken tent. The funniest was when the leader said if we had more time, but you did. And you did nothing. I wish team stunt had made it to the final four instead of you. That would have been great to watch.",

Firefighter were the most fun but wish we spent more time with the other athletes. \n\nTeam Soldier messed up their tactics and advantages on numerous occasions. Their biggest mistake was not allying with Athlete team. Forcing them to team up with the fairly useless Guard team and get eliminated twice. \n\nFor a team constantly yelling about killing their opponents they did a terrible job. Also pretty clear they didn't really share information with the  Guard team and vice versa. They could've taken the Firefighter team completely out of the digging challenge by only digging as far as they needed to and then swapping holes right at the end. Similarly the Guards had no idea how to get into the Firefighters house which the Soldiers knew. \n\nWas fully behind Firefighter but they messed up by going all out against Athlete. Even at 2v2 they were ok but in 30 seconds they lost 3 members by rushing. Athlete were right in that losing their leader would mentally affect them and they rushed the Judoka forgetting the other athlete was around.\n\nInterested to see what they'll do next season, if they get one, no idea how popular the show is.",

But let me explain, as a former soldier, it's kind of how we deal with all the situations. Embrace the suck, and just laugh about it. It's our coping mechanism in practice. So I wasn't as put off by other people watching but throwing the fire extinguisher is what got me, I think contestants just got really emotionally invested in not letting their team down and some of them let it get to their heads.  \n\n\nIt kind of reminds me of any survival show that Netflix did called \"Outlast.\" It was supposed to be a wilderness survival show but it honestly turned out to be an insane social experiment. People were backstabbing each other, doing whatever they could to get each other eliminated. I think when game shows are hosted like this, rules need to be laid out better, and Siren did a much better job of that than \"Outlast.\" At least, Siren had guidelines and rules, it honestly felt like \"Outlast\" had none.",

            "comment": "Full review here!\n\nThe main thing im surprised about is the lack of a prize (though i feel like its cus their professions are involved and that would discredit their efforts to kind of represent their professions)\n\nIn the beginning, i was rooting for stunts (after ep 1) because they were so quick to form an alliance and knew how to play the game well. I think i was more drawn to the groups with personalities shown as well (stunts, soldiers, ff and athletes) and when i saw all their personalities i would say that i was v much ff and athletes although i could easily say that stunts x soldiers had vv good strategies since the start!! \n\nI think as much as the firefighters tried to up their defense for their base, i don't think &gt;! They particularly did it super well? I honestly think the flag tied to the tree was a bad idea since the start.. but i think the only reason why they never felt how bad of an idea it was was because nobody ever managed to enter their base prior to this !&lt; \n\nBase battle 3 &amp; 4:\nAlthough it was upsetting to see &gt;! the dirty tactics used in game.. !&lt; im glad the &gt;! showrunners caught it and addressed it because it was mentioned by someone in the prev thread as well (about how using an axe to open the door when there are 2 ppl on the other side without any weapons barely seems fair) !&lt; but for everyone wondering why the tactic for &gt;! team soldiers was for 2 to be outside doing... all.. that..  i honestly feel like its because they were just mad that the ff team made them wait till 8pm for a battle.. like im pretty sure they were just hungry and on edge after being anxious for 12++ hours since they thought it would be at 8am and needed a way to direct that anger back at them which explains them also throwing dirty water etc. Not excusing them ofc but just providing a possible explanation !&lt;\n\nI think it's safe to say that everyone was &gt;! Disappointed with the guards team.. esp after they hyped them up with the whole teaser of the leader swinging the dude by the neck with her legs in a simulated battle.. like 90% of battles for guards team was j them reaching their destination a tad too late :\") i was so upset watching them literally WATCH team soldier from afar and just turn back even before reaching the cabin... !&lt; also &gt;! Them going to the soldiers new tent was so dumb esp when they knew a battle would start after noon.. i was SCREAMING at my tv and you could even see kkangmi literally have a face of resignation as she watched her run to her base.. !&lt;\n\nAlso some stuff i noticed about &gt;! Their attempt at getting into the square house.. literally they kept kicking on the wall beside the door instead of the actual.. door.. this time the door wasnt even hidden.. im so glad the tension build up in the prev ep was just for the sake of climax purposes because if the ff team hiding in the bushes only kept asking \"is it hard capturing the flag??\" And not actually doing anything to stop the guards from getting in.. i would actually be so pissed off !&lt;\n\nLast battle:\nAs someone who likes both the last teams i was excited but i already knew &gt;! Athletes !&lt; had it in the bag!! They were so prepared and were so consistent in &gt;! Building the defense!! When i saw stunts go down like that my first instinct as a viewer was to go \"why didnt they barricade the top or anything\" and the athletes read my mind well.. i think they also took into account every entry point that people could use (by people.. i mean them because only they would be able to enter from all those entry points BHRJSJDK) and blocked it all so even if the 3 ff were not eliminated at the door step, i doubt they would have EVER been able to make it up there even if it was 2v2 or 4v4.. !&lt;\n\nAlso i never actually understood why &gt;! The one person defending their base.. is hiding at the side esp because for this team, they came over to the ff base so often that they definitely knew how to open the door without help.. maybe its because we didnt get to see the personalities of the other 2 ff team besides hyeona and minseon but it felt kinda sad that i couldnt see her prove herself !&lt;\n\nOverall feelings about teams:\nI think overall, for teams with personalities mentioned, i think the soldiers team and the athletes team are the teams everyone will rmb each individual member because they all had significant roles and moments to shine. Like other ppl i hoped soldier x stunts vs ff x athletes would be a reality since stunts were definitely better at attacking people and i would have loved to see them strategize more..\n\nI also think these 2 teams &gt;! Did the best at hiding their flags/making it harder to reach !&lt; it's interesting considering the main reason why the athletes wanted to catch a flag so badly at the start was just because they wanted to sleep in a house \u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\n\nI think Siren is a really enjoyable watch, albeit frustrating at times, but i really liked the insights given into each profession which showed us how they applied their professional knowledge into these team battles. I think it's also interesting to see their tactics and strategies differ from team to team and how their perspectives are very much tied to their profession.. like i doubt the athletes would &gt;! Play dirty esp when they are national level athletes which made me think about how they managed to win without doing any particularly dirty strategy !&lt; and also how tenacious they are. The least enjoyable part HAAASSS to be the cheapo drawn woman with the moving mouth as a narrator though..\nOut of the 24 contestants, some had really strong personalities and i think as a viewer, it's great that people seem to find at least 1 person they really like even if it might be different or \"against\" another person because it shows that they rlly casted a wide variety of people! I think the only thing that could have made it better was if the winning team was celebrated by the rest of the opponents or at least everyone had a ceremony to thank each other &gt;! Because i found them hugging each orher and doing a cheer after the consolation match really wholesome and showed that they are all alright with each other outside the context of a competition !&lt;",

I wanted to see them at least say a final good game and goodbye to their final opponents, because I think those teams had so much respect for each other and it would have been really moving.\n\nI think Hyeon-Ji (the petite firefighter) showed some personality. I first really noticed her when they &gt;!won the first arena battle and got their reward delivered!&lt; , she did the cutest little happy dance, and they showed her doing little shimmies of joy at other moments, and being generally cute/happy/playful.  But if it comes to personality as a force in the game, you're totally right.  I think Teams Athlete and Soldier were the ones where all four members made a distinct impact personality wise and as players of the game.\n\nI too was disappointed that &gt;!the firefighters never changed their flag-hiding strategy. I didn't think it was that great of a strategy to begin with, especially when we saw that people could get at the flag from the roof without having to go through the house. Plus I think all the other teams knew where their flag was by the final two base battles.  Like, change it for the last battle at least!  !&lt;",

They were the first team to abandon their base entirely and go 4-0 on attack- their bravery was rewarded.\n\n4) The quality of the bases mattered... a bit too much. Stunt/Athlete's was basically impenetrable due to the second floor, and FireFighter's wasn't easy to get to either.\n\n5) As much as Guard sucked, they also reaped the benefit of being so far away- there's no way they would have been third otherwise.\n\n6) Looking forward to season 2- maybe with athletes of different sports? But please, not with men- it would get violent.",

I wanted to give red hair bob from Team Soldier a second chance because I already found her cringe in Physical 100 but she is just 200% more annoying in this show. Also, I think the two members of Team Soldier who got the penalties were only sorry because they got caught. The way they were straight up lying and defending themselves against Team Firefighter just shows how little sportsmanship they have. Totally lost respect for the both of them even if their team had great ideas and strategies. I only really liked the intel girl from Team Soldier! \n\nOverall, still a very good show and I hope to see another season! Just hope they wouldn\u2019t have a base so far from the others in the next season, and maybe the consolation game should be changed so it\u2019s more fair to all teams. Just find it so silly that two teams waited so long on an island just to go home right after the consolation game.",

You are literally operating on adrenaline and primal instincts once a conflict happens. \n\nWhat may seem like common sense or something clever to do is 10x as hard.\n\nEvery team did a good job IMHO given their past experiences and limited resources. This especially goes for all the non-soldier teams who I believe not being used to a jungle environment is already half the battle lost. \n\nI heard a lot of 'lol guard team lazy stay in tent the whole show' if I'd thrown a civilian into that environment which is essentially what they are, believe me, even walking to the latrine is an onius task. \n\nKudos to the firefighter team's tenacity.

            "comment": "I *tried* to keep it short because I could write maybe 10x more but no one is that crazy. Also: **spoilers** for the whole show ahead.\n\nFirefighter's leader is very careless which I felt was fitting for her job stereotype. A hero to a fault.  \nWhen she lost her flag on ep 1 I was expecting someone in her team or even herself to reflect and comment how that was exactly \"rash\" (going 2v3 *from* the heat of the moment). Nope, just something about exposing her back and nothing else (I did give a benefit of doubt from the elusive crime of being Edited Out but by later eps it's pretty clear this is just how she is).  \nShe has great charisma and (people) leadership but *not* a strategist. All her good planning yet throwing out everything in the heat of the moment every single day/match. That's not someone I'd want to lead a team game but she has a good heart which is easy to root for.  \nBut in fact, I think no one really is a strategist or the rules were too left out in the open (so everyone ultimately acts solo) because I was half expecting the fights to drag longer than a minute or 10. Possibly hours. But the participants themselves were at lost even mentioning it's over in minutes (that's when you know that stuff behind the scenes majorly affecting them won't be seen on screen).  \nA comment highlight that the seaside base was prefaced to be strategic for burying the flag under the tide (I personally never thought of) but burying wasn't in anyone's playbook if you assume there was no rules about (that the little we're let on is a bone to pick on for another day) *Hilariously* after selling out all the shovels (which I thought would be brilliant foreshadowing). ***Narrator*** It wasn't.\n\nAnd all the flak for Guards but it's probably pretty clear that this show is all about stamina. Every advantage (benefits, choice to choose) has something Firefighters, Soldiers, Stunt, and Athletes has experience in but nothing that plays to Police and Guard's strength like intel or mental prowess which only make them more tired and less performing as the day goes with morale deboosters (mini games).  \nVery early on when Police was eliminated I thought a better welcome match would be to showcase everyone's strength and without elimination (the premise *was* about women being just as physically and mentally par in male dominated areas from *varied* skillsets, even the Soldier's intel person while had one of the most exciting moments of the show couldn't be credited *that* much to any actual victory because), as the game progressed, it's all about luck (whether you prepped enough before the siren) and brawling. If you really think about it, did the added advantages really do anything for the battle itself? (Besides bases that felt underhanded and about luck because it was shoved in as a prize no one was aware of) Neglectable imo.  \nSo again, tiring everyone but those built for stamina.  \nAnd all the hush, reveal, and anticipation of the consolidation island and it was over in less than 5 (airtime) minutes. Really?\n\nAnd while liking Soldiers' less and less as time goes on, I appreciate that we get to see exactly into their strengths (rugged territories and limited resources) even if the show is a bit biased on them for it.  \nAnd I get people focusing on Soldiers saying \"let's kill them\" as a partial to their psyche I don't think it's that serious. Firefighters who deal with trying to prevent death (and failing a lot) everyday by ordinary means would of course be offended by the casual use. Which honestly made the rivalry fun because of their opposing views.  \nAlso to say on that flip side, Soldiers deal with death on a very senseless manner and their only counter is honour (it's a needed spin to its ugliness) which is why there is a lot of cold, aloofness, and even arrogance. It's a valid strength when it comes to their job and instead of respecting them for that, they *were* turned into villains (because this has no place in a civilian world). And I hate that for them.\n\nAll in all. The show is just about brawling which is effective to showcase certain strengths. But also one comment that mentioned that the show seems well made and the fault is more of the participants, I kinda agree. If to mention the thing about not burying flags and how the shop's items were not even properly introduced (I had trouble discerning if it's their personal items or it came with the base which is dumb when you think of it but by not introducing their stake it ofc didn't felt like it was a reward item but the \"just is\"), so many ways to go about this but didn't.  \nThough I still can't help but be disappointed by the show not having plotted/stronger rules for a solid for each job's strength in the match if not as the opening one especially that there's no prize money. Do I even dare think the worst if it's just wanting to get away with no prize money aka gender gap?  \nIf not, I scoff at them anyway for selling the lackof prize money eliminates ego but in the end it was ruled by ego, just in a different lens.  \n1. Soldiers who lead the show's script (popular expectations) were toppled for their arrogance. Fun but predictable.  \n2. Firefighters placing unweaving support to their careless leader who because threw all planning out the window, did not play for the team (a unit) but \"self\". Notice that Soldiers(iirc?), Athletes, and the Firefighters themselves (or just the one charismatic voiceovers/chopper that \"highly looks up to her\") even realise this by saying something like \"take out their leader and the rest falls apart\". They wouldn't last two rounds if the match went for longer.  \nNo strats (participants) or \"anything goes\" (show's script) means that it *is* about ego. Not honour in their job. If you don't even get to showcase the strength where it's at, where's the honour in that? Looking at Police especially.  \nTo finally conclude, I actually quite enjoyed the show for what it is. Just sad that despite all my woes, it's still (the show's) net positive commentary on women's place in the world. The low bar that I wish it wasn't.",

I was not happy with the result, it was an easy and quick win as it was expected.\n\nIdk about anyone else, but the first thing that came into my mind on how to keep the flag safe was to bury it to the ground. You don\u2019t even have to protect it as others won\u2019t even find it. Especially when you can buy shovels from the store. Rather than tying it to the tree or keeping it in a cabinet or just hiding it near the bed, isn\u2019t burying the flag much better ? And even when days have passed, none of the teams changed the place for their flags.",

            "comment": "To be honest watching the whole show was infuriating. How they won was infuriating and having a team located far away seems very stupid to have in the show. If the show becomes a show of how to form an alliance then the team that is far away would always be at a disadvantage because of how much time they would need to travel. And because of that travel time there will be no point to form an alliance with a group that has no ability to help. \n\nTo be honest though. When I first saw team stunt lose i thought that was the soldiers first mistake. Having to form a team with that much distance between them is silly. Each time should at least have the exact same travel time to get to so and so base to make the game a lot more strategic. \n\nOther than that firefighter seem to be the team with the poorest tactics and just seem to coast through with team athlete by their side. I already knew how the battle between team firefighter and team athlete would of gone once team guard and team soldier were out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a game which is a base battle lacking any type of strategic ability and just becoming a numbers game is absolutely a bore. The finale was not good and absolutely a bore too. I wish there was more from team guard. I hate the first challenge threw a bone to firefighters. Absolutely ridiculous. The show has a good premise. The execution were terrible. I think the team challenges were not good to test every team ability and corroboration. Just fell flat.",

My problem with the show and how i think about it is that, gaining new bases seem useless unless you had a tent. I wish more was done for that. \n\nTeam guard was absolutely useless and if you notice how useless they were the whole season move he tent a little closer or do something else at least. I was thinking that maybe that all  bases should have equal amount of travel line if spent running from one base to another so that if you form an alliance and you want to do defense then it's much easier.\n\nWhen i watched he show. I was like you can always ignore the team furthest away because they can't defend anything or anyone so what's the point of that?\n\nThey could have people take over the base and recruit more members in the base battle so here would be more \"Consequences.\" like if team soldiers takes over team police then police becomes team soldiers and then you grow your base there (If you want to focus on alliance base competition.).\n\nIf you want to focus on team \"strength\" the challenges shouldn't be building a campfire, and then have to put out the fire with firefighters is insane. Digging a hole is insane. You just need a person with the strongest endurance to win. You want to show strength and more strategy then make the challenges more team base...something closer to survivor type game.\n\nYou can do so much stuff with the premise of the show but it feels lazy.

They also did the most stupid moves in the show. Supposedly, they should be good at strategies but they were so bad at it. \n\n- They didn't have scouts to cover their ally's bases so they weren't able to help them on time.\n\n- They are expecting an attack from 8 people and even asked support from the guards which they knew would they a  while to come. What did they do? Defend with 2 people, outside their base, totally exposed. \n\n- When they were talking about using the fire extinguishers I thought they were gonna do it from inside so when their door is broken, they'd spray them so they'd have trouble going through that small hole. I mean wasn't that why they barricaded the entrance in the first place? Then they went out instead lol like how the fuck did they expect to win 2v8, promptly enough that annoying red hair leader got dragged off the porch really quick.\n\n- When the two people got discovered during their last battle, instead retreating to their base so they can regroup there they just split apart resulting on them getting picked off 1 by 1 leaving it 2v4 again, and then when that 1 girl managed to sneakily capture a flag he just stood there and waited to be cornered instead of running away and putting distance against the attackers, or going inside for better leverage instead of being cornered in the open.",

I also think they gave her too much credit everytime she got a flag it was always 3 on 1 not that impressive. They always needed a number advantage to prevail during base battles.",

Somehow i don\u2019t like the leader of team firefighter. She almost make the team suffer so many times, but she is a great leader though. Team athlete was humble, i didnt notice them at the start but they winning is better for me than team firefighter, but i pity that hardworking girl. She do everything because of her leader. I like team soldier because they are cunning and fearless, but yes they shouldnt throw the empty fire extinguisher. They have their own strategy. But with 2 team alliance, nothing for them to do. And the redemption second chance is not great as well. Why does they put their tent so close to team firefighter and so expose? They should make it nearer team guard for combine attack/defend. And talking about team guard, pfft they were useless. Imagine if they go straight to tem soldier, it will be 6 vs 4, but they do nothing in front of team athlete base. They should be the first or second to be eliminated. Team firefighter &amp; team athlete vs team soldier &amp; team stunts is better fight. Team police, i have nothing to say.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!However, the title is survive the island, I can find the survival aspect of this games. And what happen at the end?!&lt;",

Guards were just poor allies and soldiers/stunt alliance was caught offguard and soldiers decided to stay out of the fight. \n\nThe athlete/ff 8 just worked together better and utilised their strengths better than the soldier/guard or soldier/stunt alliance. At one point, weren't soldiers aligned with both stunt and guards at the same time? Ultimately it felt like the athlete/ff alliance trusted each other more and worked together better because their styles were similar - no elaborate strategies and they were all straight shooters. \n\nI do wish that the other alliances put up a stronger fight though.

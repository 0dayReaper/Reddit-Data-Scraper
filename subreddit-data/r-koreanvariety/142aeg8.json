If you really want, you can watch it raw esp if you can understand basic korean since you can understand the show\u2019s flow just by watching the scenes :)",

However, there were some scenes like when they were digging the well that I thought were impressive.\n\nThe Soldiers and Physical 100 were both amazing. I think The Soldiers was the best out of the three. I think there was a show called \uac00\uc9dc\uc0ac\ub098\uc774 and season 2, which was really popular.",

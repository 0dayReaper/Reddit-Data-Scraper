    "postText": "Ok so if you haven\u2019t watched episode 75 or any of the raw episodes yet exit out now.\n\nOk so on to the topic of discussion who do we have to go to or who\u2019s page do we have to bombard? Because clearly the production team needs some new ideas along with Manager Ahn. I don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t do more video analysis, in episode 75 even Coach Lee said it\u2019s easier to learn from their mistakes if they\u2019re watching while it\u2019s being pointed out. \n\nI love the competitiveness of Season 2 but I hate the fact that the show focuses too much on the games and not the actual training that goes into making these top athletes soccer players. You can say it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want their tactics exposed but in reality they themselves are the ones doing that they don\u2019t have to show us the strategies but they do instead they could just show us the drills that help them score goals, pass better, trap better, get used to new positions, create better teamwork, etc. Instead they show us their corner kick strategies and constantly broadcast their set play strategies that\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard for them to score a goal doing a set play.\n\nObviously they must practice together sometimes outside of the shoots we\u2019ve seen glimpses of it on the show but it surely isn\u2019t enough since they keep making the same mistakes they were making at the beginning of the show. I think the manager tells them to practice on their own too much, a team with good teamwork is always going to be better then a team that practices by themselves and only come together at the recordings. It\u2019s easier trapping a pass from your teammate if you practice with that teammate consistently.\n\nI follow some of the cast and they upload videos and pics of them practicing by themselves or with other cast members sometimes and the ones I\u2019ve seen do that are usually the ones who are showing improvement on the show. The ones who are practicing but aren\u2019t showing improvement need better coaching methods then just criticism, scolding, and short lessons before a game. Also it\u2019s a little bit unfair to tell them to practice on their own time when they could easily practice together at the recording especially because they are busy with their life or their own sport/job and some of them are literally coaching the national teams of their own sport.\n\nThey need to do a training camp not one like Namhae but one where they all live in the same quarters, they cook together, they play games, they do video analysis, they do drills to correct what the video analysis shows them what they did wrong and compliment what they did right.\n\nI think that would be a good couple of episodes we still get the variety without taking away from the competitive soccer element and it will help the team with individual skills but also team skills. Also since they\u2019re recruiting new players this would be such a good idea for them to do after all the auditions. Someone needs to get me a meeting with their head producer \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.\n\nPS : for everyone who says they want this season to be a more relaxed like season 1 you have to realize that these players are top athletes who most have been in the Olympics like season 1 but they mostly are still active or just recently retired so they themselves are going to be more competitive than the season 1 cast especially since some of them auditioned because they wanted to be soccer players or have a passion for soccer.",

Why not just train together on recording day and give us more than a glimpse of them working and training hard.",

You generally wouldn\u2019t spend too much time on basic skills in a team setting so I have no issue with that. \n\nUnfortunately there are some players (Andre, Jangkun, Taebum etc) who have not been great at receiving/ reacting to criticism. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s the coaches responsibility to hold their hands all the time.\n\nDon\u2019t know if I\u2019m really even responding to your comment well but if they took out the weekly games I wouldn\u2019t watch it anymore so hopefully they don\u2019t do that. \n\nIf they really wanted to go fully competitive then they would be cutting players but I don\u2019t think most people would be for that.\n\nI\u2019m only caught up with Netflix and they are playing really well but you make it sound like they are having some kind of emergency so I will take that as a spoiler.",

But he seems to have been practicing on social media.\n\nAndre seems abit too egoistical in the episode where he said he does not understand the offside rule and comes across as being arrogant to LDG.\n\nLove the anchovies and Kyu-gyu duo.",

            "comment": "i mean tbh as much as they want to train together pff cam the coaches and other athletes have other schedules lining up so i do think it is kinda impossible to gather them all and train together\u2026 but as an athlete myself playing constantly could also improve because they are facing a different team every week so all of them have different tactics strengths and weaknesses so maybe thats what manager ahn wants. tho it would be nice to see some of their episodes that only features them training and have more variety.\n\ni also want to add that whenever they get important games like fighting for the title they seem to lack players even with the addition with the gyu-gyu line and jihwan, like or defenders are kinda weak rn (tbh im not loving andres attitude as of the moment) and we also need a very solid keeper the 3 keepers are so weak and jangkun has been falling off recently too. im glad that manager ahn did another audition",

    "postText": "So the fourth season of Heart Signal just dropped after a three-year hiatus, and someone in the Viki comments just said that they recommend the Chinese version. I didn\u2019t even know a Chinese version existed, but what intrigued me even more was that they said the guys actually like different girls. \n\nAnyone that has watched any of the Korean version seasons would remember how all the guys basically just liked one girl and it was very frustrating to watch. I now come to find out there are 3 - 5 seasons of the Chinese version, and I\u2019m honestly just trying to find which one this person was referring to that was actually different. Would anyone know? \n\nSecondly, out of all the Chinese seasons, which one would you recommend to watch? Judging by how the person put it, both answers might be just for one specific season. I would love to actually see a dynamic where all the men aren\u2019t just falling for one girl. I\u2019m on the first episode of Heart Signal 4 k.ver, and it seems like that\u2019s going to be the trend again unfortunately. Please and thanks!",

The final couple there is about to get married already.But the panel discussion is a bit too long for me that I often skip their parts but they are more blunt and I feel that I can relate more to their views than the sugarcoated version of the Korean and OG Heart signal.\n\nOff topic: In terms of panel discussion though, I love the Terrace House panel. They are funny and the comments can be a bit offensive for others but hilarious for me.",

Heart Signal has the only decent panels but they are still not nearly as good. \n\nI also think the Terrace House Spinoff, Shanghai Sharehouse has an even better commentary panel. The great thing about the chinese version is that everyone on the panel contributes something, be it a different perspective, or jokes, or even just having good facial reactions to things that happen.",

I already can\u2019t deal with the panel discussion on the k version because it\u2019s so cringe and corny and I feel like we don\u2019t even need a panel in the first place. The fact that you said that they\u2019re going to be blunt, though does give me some hope. \n\nRegarding Terrace house isn\u2019t that the show that had those two contestants that unfortunately aren\u2019t with us anymore? That makes me hesitate to watch the show because I don\u2019t want to see them go through whatever they might have gone through? If that makes any sense. If you still think it\u2019s worth a watch, then what season would you recommend? Because I know that there are so many terrace houses now",

                            "comment": "For Terrace House, definitely watch **Terrace House: Boys x Girls Next Door** first if you want as most people that watched it considered it the best. Otherwise people really like Boys &amp; Girls in the City, and for some people that's it, but some also enjoy Opening New Doors, and Tokyo 2019-2020. \n\nIt's Aloha State that gets mixed reviews as due to visa/working requirements, they had to cast more Americans/foreigners instead of Japanese people and so it was kinda like a more American show. Some people didn't like that as they watched Terrace House for Japanese culture, norms, etc. For some of the Japanese viewers they apparently liked it as it was a reverse for us westerners/non-Japanese people, an insight into American/Hawaii culture.\n\nBut IMO, all the seasons are worth a watch since nothing is like Terrace House (this is a biased opinion though from somebody that really likes the concept). Hell, Aloha State has the funniest storyline ever for one of the housemates, you'll know it when you see a love worth dying for.\n\nThe panelists for Terrace House can be too savage and so on, but it's largely in the spirit of good fun. As otherwise certain situations are cringe, boring, problematic, et cetera. So making light of it helps people move along, for better or worse. \n\nTerrace House definitely has some of the best panelists in any dating or variety/reality show though, they are legendary, all of them, even the rotating \"boy prince/younger member\" guests.\n\n**If you haven't watched the original first season of Terrace House, this is kinda how to watch Terrace House: Boys x Girls Next Door**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zfkwnq/how_do_i_watch_boys_girls_next_door/izchnov/\n\n**The Chinese version of Terrace House, Shanghai Sharelife (/r/Shanghaisharelife), also has proper English subs instead of machine translation**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10e0lg5/that_girl_who_was_obsessed_with_the_noodle_museum/j4oimk9/\n\n---\n\nIf you don't want panelists, watch Between Love and Friendship, there's two seasons of it. I think Season 2 still has no subs.\n\n**Between Love and Friendship (\uac01\uc790\uc758\ubcf8\ub2a5\ub300\ub85c)** is pretty short with 6 episodes and it has no panelists. It's available on VIU. It's a quick light fluffy show.\n\nThe premise for Between Love and Friendship is if friends will choose love over friends.\n\nIt sounds like Love is for Suckers, the a recent Kdrama (has Lee Da-hee and Super Junior's Choi Si-won) about how dating shows are made (a la UnREAL (/r/UnREALtv) with Rachel or Shiri Appleby), lol.\n\nBetween Love and Friendship has a somewhat serene setting to it, pretty laidback. The male participants are all friends from a Korean university, and then the female participants are also all friends but from a different university. It also has a bunch more confessionals or talking to the camera/producers scenes though.\n\n---\n\nThat reminds me, **Company/Office Romance (\uc0ac\ub0b4\uc5f0\uc560)** still has a panel but it's got some new things going for it too.\n\nViki finally subbed Company/Office Romance, more info here: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/110cqm9/office_romance_on_viki_eng_sub/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10zy4nt/office_romance_on_viki_dating_show/\n\nIn Office Romance, instead of a house/building/et cetera, they live near the work office for their fashion company, lol. This was pretty chill, got overshadowed last year because of the deluge of Korean dating shows that released in the second half of 2022.\n\nSome dating show fans from /r/koreanvariety and so on have now put it as one of the best dating shows due to the somewhat novel office company concept. Viki legit needs to pick up the Japanese dating shows from ABEMA/etc. too, like people gotta keep requesting it from Viki as you never know when they'll pick up these dating shows regularly again.\n\n---\n\nOh and there's **Sleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774)**, the panelists don't really take up much time, and the show has ridiculous and hilarious situations, more info here: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10k1l3f/physical_100_ep_12_netflix_out_now/j5p6ees/\n\nSleeping Only Relationship doesn't have an official English sub. But it does have a fan sub right now from iheartu2 (from Youtube and Twitter), check their Twitter and Youtube pages for more info.\n\n---\n\n**Love Alarm: Clap! Clap! Clap! (\uc88b\uc544\ud558\uba74 \uc6b8\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9dd!\uc9dd!\uc9dd!)** also had new elements to it. IIRC, the panelists for Love Alarm: Clap! Clap! Clap! also just mainly reacted to the amusing situations brought upon by the proximity alarms by the Love Alarm phone app, lmao. \n\nBtw, for the panelists in these dating shows, don't worry about them being corny and cringe, just try to play along as it can enhance the experience, rofl.\n\nLove Alarm: Clap! Clap! Clap! is liked by a lot of people, it's based off a Korean webtoon, there's actually a Kdrama (from 3 or so years ago) of the webtoon on Netflix.\n\nFor Love Alarm: Clap! Clap! Clap!, apparently the English/etc. subs are on Dailymotion.\n\nCompiled list of other East Asian dating shows (this is initially sorta \"scandalous\" dating shows, like Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774), Secret Man and Woman (\ube44\ubc00\ub0a8\ub140), REA(L)OVE, et cetera, click through the thread links for more other info): https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/y83ke7/pink_lie_episode_4_discussion_spoilers/j584452/\n\n---\n\nTry some dating shows on Youtube (**Creator Campus (\ud06c\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc774\ud130 \ucea0\ud37c\uc2a4), Ramyun &amp; Chill (from DKDKTV channel), 3&amp;More (from Blimey \ube14\ub77c\uc774\ubbf8 channel)**, etc.), sometimes the panelists are also maybe quick or don't have as much screen time there: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/12ccjku/can_someone_give_me_a_list_of_korean_variety/jf16a56/\n\n**Play Safe Play Me** was unexpected so good, definitely try it (especially since you like multiple pairings or less focus on one person). They're on an island and it's pretty peaceful. Just ignore the gambling sponsor advertisements and elements, lol.\n\nThese are Malaysian-Chinese/Singaporean/etc. dating shows, Play Safe Play Me, One Week Love, and Dui Ni You Gan Jue, check here: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yyjiu2/love_catcher_in_bali_e01_221118/iwvbxrm/\n\nPlay Safe Play Me (from the Leeroy Wong channel), it was marketed/titled as a Malaysian version of Single's Inferno but it's actually really different and somewhat chill. Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt665qFsW3s\n\n---\n\nPanelists are kinda there to reinforce the audience's thoughts, or to like set up certain storylines, and so on. Try to fast forward if you think they have too much screen time, especially for Chinese dating shows, as yup it can be frustrating to wait for the housemates again, lol.\n\nSome people's list is probably like this: **Shanghai Sharelife** preferred over **Terrace House**, which is favored over **Heart Signal (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110 and \u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7)**, and now the **EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560)** series, with possibly **Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac)** and **Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774)** in tow.\n\nSome people don't like the scriptedness of Shanghai Sharelife too, but stay for the panelists, lol.\n\nShanghai Sharelife's panelists are often considered at the top of these dating shows and they can/will influence how you perceive the housemates' personalities, actions, et cetera. They make some situations extra funny, just like Terrace House's panelists.\n\n**More context (essentially has no spoilers though) on Shanghai Sharelife panelists**: https://www.reddit.com/r/Shanghaisharelife/comments/o4ljmq/unpopular_opinion/h2iu3q7/\n\nShows maybe like Terrace House: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/11omuh3/where_to_find_comfort_now/jbuxsfz/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10pyock/im_just_sad_terrace_house_is_gone_i_miss_them_all/j6ri6vt/?context=10000\n\n---\n\nAs for the manner of Hana Kimura's suicide, some people are often shortsighted or don't know much of the context surrounding Hana's life. \n\nErgo they blame the Terrace House panelists, the show itself, and the trolling/toxic/etc. commenters. Like they fail to see the bigger picture: Hana was half Indonesian in Japan/East Asia, she had a busy mother especially during her childhood, her whole career was put on hold due to circumstances out of her/the world's control, et cetera.\n\nPeople like me that have firsthand experience with immigration/not belonging to the majority population, discrimination, childhood adversity, poverty, et cetera could write more about it (https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zex7ys/pink_lie_episode_11_discussion/izcr1ww/). But there are certain books you could try reading if you haven't come across them already as they'll better explain the concepts and inevitability of everything.\n\nPeople build their identities, principles, etc. over the environment they were given.\n\n&gt; Our early environments are often the determiners of the future. There are books like: \n&gt; \n&gt; **The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma by Bessel van der Kolk**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker**\n&gt; \n&gt; **What My Bones Know by Stephanie Foo**\n&gt; \n&gt; **The Deepest Well: Healing the Long-Term Effects of Childhood Adversity by Nadine Burke Harris**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents: How to Heal from Distant, Rejecting, Or Self-Involved Parents by Lindsay C. Gibson, et cetera.**\n\nAt the end of it, we don't really know much of the housemates or cast members, even if these days a lot of them will start a Youtube channel after the dating/cohabitation/etc. show, or even had their own sizable social media following beforehand. And then like they do vlogs or Q&amp;A stuff about their time in the dating show.\n\nThe other person that died is Yosuke Imai (from BGND). He didn't really die from direct suicide, supposedly it was due to heart complications after significant weight loss or something like that. He was a flawed person, and he had a hard time dealing with the world, like all of us. Yosuke is forever remembered in the show.",

Some people didn't like that part even if it was inevitable due to visuals/pageant/etc. advantage.\n\nWhat made you put it as the least favorite dating show, as some people thought it was uncomfortable to watch due to the dynamics, lol.\n\nThere's another person here (AjBlue7 and/or somebody else) in the /r/koreanvariety subreddit that IIRC disliked Between Love and Friendship too, or I think it was Chain Reaction, Eden, Sleeping Only Relationship, etc. (they mention some shows being from a particular company or channel or something like that) as they thought the situations were so scripted or like for shock factor, haha. Honestly it's understandable as a few shows were acknowledged (by the housemates and producers) to be fake/set up/etc. but at least sometimes they got hilarious scenes that you wouldn't find elsewhere or see otherwise.\n\nFor me my least favorite dating shows are some seasons of I Am Solo (due to mismatches or like over the top situations, lmao) but otherwise I just try to enjoy the ride for the ephemeral butterflies, lol.",

So that happened on the last season (Tokyo 2019-2020).\n\nThe best season beyond a doubt is the first season that aired only in japan (not on netflix). You can easily find it online with fansubs. It is called TH: boys and girls next door. That season does have the other participant who died but it was 1.5 years after his appearance on the show and he had a heart attack.\n\nAfter you watch BGND, you can watch the remaining seasons in chronological order. I recommend doing this bc old members from previous seasons sometimes appear on future seasons. So after BGND, it's boys and girls in the city, then aloha state, then opening new doors.",

It's really really bad. They make the cast act out scenes for products in commercials during the show and also force the cast to mention products during some scenes in normal conversations..\n\nJust skip through the ads and it's fantastic",

See the threads on reddit and like Youtube posts, MyDramaList comments, et cetera. And now yup, Season 5 is also liked by a lot of people.\n\nIf you don't mind a bit of spoilers since it's relevant to the \"all the guys basically just liked one girl\" trope/situation/et cetera, then go for Heart Signal 5, lol.\n\nOh and there's also the Chinese version of Love Catcher, btw. IIRC, that one has a bit of variety on which girls/love triangles/etc. are preferred as well, but it's been a year or so since I watched that, gotta do a rewatch to remember.\n\nThe **Chinese version of Love Catcher, The Secret X (\u673a\u667a\u7684\u604b\u7231)**, Episode 1 from iQIYI Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTj-dJkp8o\n\n---\n\n**Yes, I Do Season 4 (\u559c\u6b22\u4f60\u6211\u4e5f\u662f4)** begins with sorta multiple pairs too, but it's like overlapping triangles.\n\nYes, I Do (\u559c\u6b22\u4f60\u6211\u4e5f\u662f4), from iQIYI channel, Episode 1, Part 1 and 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqkOGp2dQqw and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEV0hZTWj9c\n\n---\n\nThere's also **Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81)**. Especially Season 2, that one has separate pairings too instead of just a focus on one girl. \n\nTwinkle Love Season 3 (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81 \u7b2c\u4e09\u5b63), /r/twinklelove3, just began last week, and Episode 2 Part 2 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqhXh2NAL2M) should be released/premiered in about 2 hours (now just an hour after typing these 9000 characters comment). So basically the schedule is like this: Part 1 is released every 12:00AM (New York Time, Eastern Daylight Time) on Thursday and then Part 2 is released 10 hours later, every 10:00AM on Thursday.\n\nFor Twinkle Love Season 3, you know **Shen Yue from Meteor Garden, A Love So Beautiful, et cetera**? She's one of the panelists for Twinkle Love Season 3 now, and it looks like she got super immersed into the show, lol. \n\nShen Yue be raging and cringing with everyone too, lmao, she's so funny here. Jam Hsiao has been with Twinkle Love for all three seasons now, prepare for his crying, haha, he gets so invested and emotional just like us viewers.\n\nAnyway, Twinkle Love 3 also looks like it will have distinct couples but right now there's actually love triangles, lol, so not sure yet if it'll be similar to Season 2 of Twinkle Love. \n\nThe love triangle for Twinkle Love 3 is ridiculous (one of the guys is super upbeat and smiling all the time and then the other guy is so frustrated and competitive, rofl) right now, it's over a short-haired girl that looks like OMG Arin, WJSN Luda, et cetera, lmao. \n\nThankfully in Twinkle Love, there's actually bromances, sismances, etc. going on and so they'll back off if they think their homie is interested in a particular girl/boy. \n\nAs in, during their breaks in the bedroom/living room/etc. they'll directly ask if their roommate is locking in with a certain person in the opposite group, and then they'll consider backing off or competing still. And so it's probably not gonna be like Heart Signal and other shows, or right now Heart Signal 4 with Jiyoung (the short-haired girl).\n\nThat's one of the best things about Twinkle Love, you can see them develop friendships, even if it's a little bit performative. Twinkle Love is absolutely one of the best youth shows and if this was available on Korean streaming platforms or say Netflix, it would blow up as that demographic is kinda the main target for a lot of Kpop/Kdrama/Korean variety show/etc. consumers.\n\n---\n\nAnother show with different matches is **Relationship S3/Let's Fall In Love Season 3 (\u6211\u4eec\u604b\u7231\u5427 \u7b2c\u4e09\u5b63)**. Wait, this is actually kinda the reverse of the situation, lol. So like instead of the boys pursuing one girl, it's the girls pursuing two particular boys. \n\nAnyway, so think of it as a contrasting version, as in Let's Fall In Love Season 3 can be frustrating, boring, et cetera to watch due to its slow burn, but for people like me that appreciate slice of life and a different change of pace, it's still rare that you'd see somewhat proactive girls in these dating shows.\n\nRelationship S3/Let's Fall In Love Season 3 (\u6211\u4eec\u604b\u7231\u5427 \u7b2c\u4e09\u5b63) is so good if you like slice of life. Episode 1 from YOUKU Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JprQ5Fd4Qo\n\nLet's Fall In Love Season 3 is a more mature or really laidback version of these dating shows though as they're in a somewhat rural/etc. area (city of Dali by Erhai Lake in Yunnan, southwest China) and so there's less of that hustle feeling. Some shots of this show really gives you that slice of life bliss.\n\nLike that idyllic, bucolic life, with the picturesque fields, forests, mountains, et cetera.\n\nThere's also this Chinese slice of life romcom/drama set in Dali/Yunnan with Liu Yifei or the Mulan actress. It's called Meet Yourself (\u53bb\u6709\u98ce\u7684\u5730\u65b9), here's Episode 1 (with English subs) from the \u534e\u7b56\u5f71\u89c6\u5b98\u65b9\u9891\u9053 China Huace TV Official Channel, but you can watch it on Viki too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj__X2BRhyo\n\n---\n\nOh and try **I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO (/r/IamSolo)** if you haven't already as it's a more raw version of these dating shows. Sometimes there's often more than one couple at the end of the season or even if there's not, you can see them pair up over the episodes anyway.\n\nAfter Season 7, be aware of girls named Ok Soon as they get compared to the legendary one of Season 7 and so it ends up with like 3-5 boys initially choosing Ok Soon for the competition/pride/clout/et cetera, rofl.\n\nSeason 7 starts at Episode 39, ends with Episode 44. Each season of I Am Solo is say 6-8(/10) episodes and they can be watched standalone, no need to watch the previous seasons.\n\nMore info on I Am Solo: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/12bduuc/new_offbrand_terrace_house_set_to_start_this_may/jewxvfh/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10en6s3/couples_who_are_still_together_after_dating_show/j4sgvhq/\n\n---\n\nAnyway, it's hard to state exactly which shows will have a reduced version of the \"everybody pursue one person\" in the beginning as eventually it actually tapers off, especially when the catfishes (just another word for newcomers) are introduced. That's usually when people settle or form their selections in order to not feel left out and so on. \n\nPlus, it's spoilers to say which ones will eventually match at the end as sometimes it seems as if it's just one solid couple but then there's a random duo or so out of nowhere just to save face or to like make it fun, lol.\n\n**In general though, expect Chinese dating shows to have multiple partners (see Weibo or Chinese social mediate, they post a lot of updates)**. Like recently a bunch of people from Chinese dating shows are actually becoming married/engaged/official/etc. to their chosen person from the dating show. \n\nMeanwhile with Korean dating shows, it's kinda unknown if they're still dating unless the housemates reveals the situation several months/etc. later. Usually they'll try and date for a while but it eventually fizzles out due to the time and distance differences.\n\n---\n\nBut yes, Heart Signal really sorta emphasizes that trope or circumstances, it's how they like to edit the entire storylines. Some other Korean/etc. dating shows have less of that.\n\nFor example in **Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac)**, there's say one solid couple and then the rest are all tangled up with each other, lol. Fam, I guarantee you if the housemates for Love Catcher in Bali were in Heart Signal 4, it's almost definitely gonna be multiple couples for sure. The missed opportunities and connections due to time, man.\n\nSame with **Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774)**, like a matched pair randomly develops due to instant attraction (though in her Youtube channel the female housemate says it's just a TV show, lol), or they have this chemistry or vibe where they just know they like or want to choose each other. And then the rest of the cast acknowledges this and lets them do their own thing, and so everybody else then gets entwined with the overlapping triangles and so on, lmao.\n\n---\n\n**More info on Twinkle Love and other traveling/culture/et cetera shows**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10pyock/im_just_sad_terrace_house_is_gone_i_miss_them_all/j6rhk67/\n\n**Chinese dating shows, Chinese/Korean/etc. idols in dating shows, upcoming Korean/Japanese/etc. Netflix dating shows, et cetera**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/12qlu3e/its_just_my_impression_or_the_are_really_few/jgqusuv/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/12qj8cc/oh_my_girls_mimi_confirmed_to_join_heart_signal_4/jgqzu8i/\n\n---\n\nWhere to watch Kdramas, Korean variety shows, and so on (basically Viki, VIU, Disney+, Netflix, et cetera, might need VPNs set to (Southeast) Asia): https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10fpzhx/overall_thoughts_on_love_catcher_in_bali/j5cmhaw/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/13bmtin/anyone_know_where_can_i_watch_the_below_korean/jjbtnuz/\n\n---\n\nCondensed version of dating shows like Ainori, Ai no Sato (Love Village), et cetera: https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveVillage1/comments/13vrhna/shows_like_love_village_ai_no_sato_ainori_et/\n\nShows like Love Village, Ainori, et cetera on the /r/ainori subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ainori/comments/13vqxt6/ai_no_sato_love_village_ainori_successor_episode/",

You should write some sort of essay or be a critic for all these shows that you mentioned. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m gonna get to watching all of the shows in the comments that you posted, but I admire the effort",

            "comment": "Heart Signal 2 was great, but honestly Heart Signal 5 was a lot of fun too, and definitely one of the best seasons in terms of every member having a proper storyline and well distributed love lines across the house. Of course some overlapped crushes here and there over the course of the season but I'd say overall the pairings ended up being really well balanced. I ended up rewatching S5 like its some sort of cdrama to re-experience the couples' cute moments because overall it was a heartwarming season.\n\nWhen watching c-variety shows it takes a lil practice to just ignore the consistent product placement, it can be a little distracting and feel awkward if you're unfamiliar. My fav pairings from season 2 and 5 of chinese heart signal ended up staying together after the show ended so it does not seem like the actual dynamics in the house are staged.",

I know the girl was nice and all but it really sucked that all the guys just liked her so it seemed like they were just looking for second best :( the Chinese version is not as bad since they all like different people and not just focused on 1 person, that's more like the 2nd season where the majority of girls like 1 guy. So I'd recommend chinese hs s1 and avoiding s2",

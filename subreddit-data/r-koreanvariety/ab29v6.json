It's so sweet to see Sun Bin being together with her ideal type!  \n\n**EDIT**: Not to put a damper on things but I just gave RM 318-319 a quick scrub through but apparently Song Ji Eun (of girl group Secret) had a crush on Kwangsoo for 7 years and she said she held him in a special place in her heart. Hopefully she wouldn't feel too down from this news **ASSUMING** she still has that special feeling towards Kwangsoo in the present time.",

    "postText": "There's been talk in some Korean boards that noticed the success of Physical 100, and a recent interview with a prominent Korean PD has been making the rounds, about the potential of Korean variety shows of becoming the next big export of the country's media. I think there are a few things that the producers of Korean variety media need to consider before drinking the kimchi soup.\n\n1. Attitude - I almost named this section as 'editing' but that's just the symptom, not the cause. Korean producers treat the viewing audience as brain dead. Now I realize that this is hyperbole, but it really gets to be too much at times. First, whenever there is a notable moment, there are multiple replays of that moment, in multiple angles, that kind of does the opposite of the intent. It actually takes away from the specialness, and beats the viewer over the head, almost taunting 'did you see that? did you hear that?' etc. What's worse is the audio. At least the video has different angles. The audio is the same every time, and painfully makes it obvious that what you have just watched is old material. One replay is enough.\n2. Subtitles - This is actually kind of an extension of the previous point, but when it is done well, it does work, so it's a different section. The subtitles added by the producers over step their bounds at times. The producers of all shows worldwide have an agenda, a picture that they want to pull off. But Korean producers use subtitles to push a narrative. The next time you look at a subtitle that is not a strict play by play of the action, think of what it does. It creates/reinforces character traits, puts a spin on what has happened, etc. They are control freaks, trying to make sure that the events of the show are interpreted their way. When it does work, they are like another member. When Infinite Challenge's subtitles worked, they did very well.\n3. Faked reality - I have experience with just a bit of Korean TV, and it was a documentary. I was surprised that the crew asked for staged events to make things more engaging. If things are like this for a documentary, I can only imagine things for variety shows. I guess this too is an extension of the above point, but the controlling of the narrative needs to stop, because the truth will get out, and people aren't as dumb as some of the producers think they are. Physical 100 right now is also dealing with controversy, and it's not really anything new. \n\nI know that I've been a drag. There are a lot of good aspects about K-variety as well. One thing that I will give K-variety shows is that they are good at framing and finding the right lens to frame the story that is filmed. They do go overboard, but it's something that is unique, and can work with apt restraint.",

Nobody I know who watches The Bachelor or Survivor or whatever thinks the producers are being honest. \n\nThere's some fake stuff in your standard variety show, but I feel like the shows are very self-aware about it. They're comedy shows, I don't think anybody is expecting 100% reality.\n\nAs for the documentary you were watching: not sure which one you mean, but assuming you're watching a serious documentary and not something mislabeled as a documentary --   \n some documentarians are ethical, some aren't. There are a lot of ethical pitfalls with documentaries, and it can be hard to find good ones. That's not really a problem specific to Korea.",

Other than Netflix shows like Singles Inferno and maybe Physical 100, I can't think of any others that have deliberately expressed their intentions to go global. Neither do I see them having a need to do so. \n\nTo me, K-variety is as local as it gets. From shows like How Do You Play, to Baek Jongwon's Restaurant Alley, You Quiz (who specifically interview Koreans), and even to online variety shows like MMTG, and even Workman (who find jobs IN Korea), they are obviously made for locals. Even the internationally popular Running Man has never provided subtitles themselves and have always engaged with very Korean traditions (like celebrating Seollal, Chuseok, playing traditional games, etc). Even 1Day2Nights' purpose is to promote local tourism. \n\nAs a viewer, I've never seen or turned to K-variety as an import of culture. On the other hand, K-pop is very upfront with their global push with their English subs, English songs, English speaking members, etc. \n\nWhile I learn to tolerate the multiple replays and edits, that's what gives K-variety its essence. If not, like what others have said, I'd rather watch western media.",

I am genuinely curious what could be construed as racist, so please enlighten me. \n\nLet's go with your question though. There are good aspects of having a character within the subtitles. I mentioned infinite challenge and one example of a pleasant surprise was during the ski-resort episode where a member gets his bare skin rubbed against a block of ice. He was obviously in discomfort, but the subtitles said something similar to 'the customer is enjoying his service' and I was quite confused because it was the opposite of what I was witnessing. Then I realize that the producers themselves are playing a character and their descriptions of the scene can enhance it.\n\nToo much of a good thing can be a detriment though. It might be a Korean thing, it might be an Asian thing, it really doesn't matter. Subtitles are an unseen hand shaping every scene. There are subtitles for sound effects, throwaway lines, little gestures, etc. It takes the ball of interpreting what's happening in the scene out of the viewer's court and into the producer's. You might like it, but it doesn't mean that I have to.",

Again, this is just personal opinion, buteven show like Dr. Oh Eun Young Golden Clinic with several known idol groups appeared as guest(s) doesn't have subs\n\nI read or heard it somewhere K-variety is 30% scripted, even when they say \"reality\" or \"unscripted\". Last time the controversy with Produce show was really huge too, but even now that kind of show, with similar style of editing and direction still happening.",

I started watching RM because of all these points you mentioned. \n\nI mean RM is the most popular Korean variety show in the world and the third most pirated show with 12% share. Do you think RM does not do all these points? They do and still they are popular. So it proves you are 100% wrong. \n\nI mean, if you have to change yourself to impress someone then that person does not deserve you. Today you'll change yourself and what will you do if tomorrow that person's interests get changed???",

But when a US company bought and moved *Whose Line Is It Anyway?* to the US, they ruined it (watch the original British seasons to see some amazing improv). My current favorite is *Would I Lie To You?*, and thankfully the British version is still going. The US version is passable (surprisingly not bad, but not great) with no real ROFL moments compared to the original, and I could only stand one episode of the Aussie version. I think this is about British style humor vs US style and what TV executives think should be aired on US TV. The original *The Muppet Show* was turned down by every US network so they moved to the UK to film there and sold the show to local US stations. Every time they try to remake it since, they lack the original flavor because of the interference of US execs who don't understand the humor and style of the original.\n\nThe US version of King of Mask Singer is also not good in comparison to the original Korean. I'm ok with some changes like elaborate costumes to hide the more varied US body shapes, but the panel is bad and the format change to extend 2 episodes into a full season makes the show incredibly boring.",

I think a part of the reason it's gaining traction globally is that it's actually starting to become accessible (thanks to the likes of Netflix). So the only thing I would really \"change\" is to make it even more accessible to global audiences.\n\nYour points are very generalised with a lot of assumptions so it's hard to respond to thoughtfully, but overall: not all shows have unnecessary editing, bad subtitles or are semi-scripted.",

Yeah it's over the top, but a lot of fans are very protective of these formats and will do what you've seen here: present a false dichotomy, that the only options are changing *nothing* about the shows, or turning them into American shows.\n\nPersonally, I don't think a Korean show turns into an American show just by removing silly subtitles printed when a dog walks by as if that's what the dog is thinking, or refining rapid replays to have less awkward audio cuts. These are somewhat strange hills for fans to die on or insist need to be protected as some fundamental, necessary element of Korean TV. But people be peopling.",

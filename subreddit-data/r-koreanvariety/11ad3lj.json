    "postText": " I am feeling a bit down lately and have rewatched all of my favorite shows. I am now interested in watching \"Code: Secret Room\", which seems to fulfill my current needs. However, I am unable to find English subtitles for the show, which could be an indication that it is not very interesting. I can understand about 90% of Korean, but I am not sure if I will be able to fully comprehend the intellectual aspects of the show in its original language. After doing some research on this subreddit, I found that people do not recommend watching the show because it is a weaker version of the The Genius. However, opinions may have changed over time due to the lack of similar shows recently. So, my questions are:\n\n1. Do you think it is worth investing time in watching this show? Is it at least half as good as \"The Genius\"?\n2. For those who understand Korean, is the language used in the show easy to understand without too many technical terms?\n\nTIA",

The puzzles are more akin to escape room type games rather than strategic ones in The Genius. \n\n\"Problematic Men\" is better. There are very few Eng sub episodes, but since you can understand a fair bit of Korean, it's worth giving the raw episodes a try.",

Iirc, there were some puzzles that could only be solved if you knew Korean or Hanja. There was a lot of math so if you're adept at it, you might be able to understand the problem and solutions.",

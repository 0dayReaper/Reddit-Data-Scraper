He seems to be trying really hard to make the segment \"fun\" with his commentary.\n\nAhhh disappointed for restaurant ceo that the model chose her again. At least it was bc he respected her achievements and thought she was impressive. 0 chemistry tho lol. \n\nBased on what restaurant ceo said abt younger men being too bold, it sounds like she was the one who pursued the calmer, more restrained older men she dated in the past. Which could explain why she's been so direct w fashion ceo, bc it worked out well for her before.\n\nAhhhh also disappointed restaurant ceo didnt make the lunchbox herself. Felt like that was a missed opp too. Or at least brought food from her own restaurants?\n\nLooks like fashion ceo and cheerleader are a done deal. Interesting that this group is using the skip button strategically as a test for their partner.\n\nWooow most uneventful lunchbox exchange yet lol. Will we get 3 pairs in the end? Looooool they even edited out who the model gave his lunchbox to. Poor guy. He got demoted to just a background role.\n\nAhhhh will cheerleader/oking make a last min switch after they talk?\n\nOking and diver intructor's dating values don't match at all. She's way more easygoing/liberal abt cross-gender interactions. I liked what she said abt how trying to control what someone else does won't work out. They'll cheat if they really wanted to.\n\nI wonder why cheerleader chose oking for the extra 2 min? Like... she thinks she's the opposite of his ideal type. Ok... so what? She could have just said she thinks he might be fun to talk to.\n\nWhy were cheerleader and fashion ceo so awk during their last convo? They only talked for 20 min earlier right (10 min x 2 sessions)? You should be able to talk for longer than 20 min w someone you're interested in lol.\n\nAwwwww med student w his squinty smile when he got picked! So sweet! \n\nOking def came for exposure lol \n\nOmg when they started playing tswift's anti-hero i thought cheerleader was gonna skip!!!\n\nThe next group looks fun!!!",

She showed no interest in him up to that point, she asked the diving athlete during lunch which made her feel a bit worried, enough to jokingly comment on it in the interview. She herself commented on it saying it looks like she (diver) really likes him. So she knew. Had she not asked that, I'd have thought it was only fair to randomly choose someone. Her choice wasn't random. I don't know what she had hoped to gain from it but she was definitely sending confusing signals to him as well during their 7mins talk (like about the height thing). Was she just casually and habitually being flirthg and fun or did she mean to be flirty and fun? Y'all downvoting me, but I'm out here being thankful she did that because ultimately that's what made that YouTuber back out and diver dodged a bullet. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I think we can pretty easily say he wasn't the most attractive out of the 4 men, despite being a model. The CEO who got the most votes = most attractive (combo of face, personality, competence, etc). Arguably oking could be considered more attractive if you're into his sense of humour. I also liked med student's personality. \n\nI don't think the model stood out at all except for his weird story abt being like a flying bird lol. \n\nThe super shy model from round 1 actually was popular. But imo that guy was better looking and had a better personality than this guy. \n\nThere was also the male model from the previous round who had a bad personality. I think people with bad personalities just won't win on this show when there are good looking + good personality alternatives. Then add to that personal preference and chemistry and there's a pretty high chance you won't hit it off w anyone despite being a \"catch\" irl.",

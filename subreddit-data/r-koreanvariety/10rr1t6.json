They probably blended the behind the scenes and so on parts for the main video too. \n\nCheck the unreleased or behind the scenes footage for Episode 1 and 2, those have say additional 20 minutes, but unfortunately they don't have English subs, unlike the main videos for the episodes.",

Don't think UMA Game is on MyDramaList yet (it's on a Korean Wiki though, called Namuwiki), I think other people have to create the page for it. Try making the page for it since MyDramaList is like a wiki/resource/database/etc. sort of website.",

Episode 1 from YOUKU Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JprQ5Fd4Qo\n\nLet's Fall In Love Season 3 is a more mature or really laidback version of these dating shows though as they're in a somewhat rural/etc. area (city of Dali by Erhai Lake in Yunnan, southwest China) and so there's less of that hustle feeling. Some shots of this show really gives you that slice of life bliss.\n\nLike that idyllic, bucolic life, with the picturesque fields, forests, mountains, et cetera.\n\nYou know Liu Yifei or the Mulan actress?

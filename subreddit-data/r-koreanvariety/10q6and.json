Of course, there are some who do it for popularity contests, but the overall goal is to win and Kyung Jin is just trying to be a team player and win. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can understand his intentions.

They were so rude in the way they laughed at her team for being weak. yes, he's team was strong and had the right to brag but it was so rude. you don't need to rub salt on someone's wound. And it pained both Eun-sil and me too. I hope her team wins, that will teach strong people to not be arrogant and underestimate others even if they seem weak.",

They\u2019re under pressure because a lot of deep pocketed media and tech companies have entered the streaming space and its very competitive now. The advantage of serializing release of episodes is to build social chatter amongst viewers outside the show and generate buzz, just like we\u2019re doing now \u263a\ufe0f",

Granted it might not have too much of an effect if she chose first since i do think she got stuck with some weak contestants but goddamn, maybe let her at least pick something this time? this felt like a penalty more than anything like wtf. the show doing it like this to me just felt like they're trying to put down team 10 at all cost. im quite annoyed because i really really like Eun Sil :(",

The water pit seems like a health hazard too as I'm sure lots of players have cuts that are bleeding into the water.. which people splash into their face/get thrown into (with their own scrapes/cuts). Agh.  \n\n\nI couldn't peel my eyes away these 2 episodes. I'm sad about a lot of folks who got sent home, especially &gt;!Agent H and Chun Ri!&lt;.  I'm wondering what the fabric strips they were given before Game 2 were for.   \n\n\nAnd of course, I want to see more women advance further along but these games so far aren't doing them a favor versus their male counterparts. I'm just going to keep getting sadder as more people I've already developed a soft spot for get sent home. Eun-sil is one of them. Can't wait for next week!",

Do you remember their names or occupations? I only remember the mma guy beating chun ri (body builder), the rugby guy beating the female wrestler (who chose a big guy on purpose), and then all the other male/female matches were glossed over quickly. \n\nI would probably have 2 prizes tbh. Seems like the fairest way. If they were going to claim that one perfect body exists which outperforms everyone else's, they shouldn't have made all the challenges naturally give men an advantage. It just seems boring/depressing to me. We already know the most athletic man will beat the most athletic woman in almost anything (unless the final is specifically designed for her skillset over his, but even then, he might still have a physical advantage).\n\n2 separate prizes for men and women. Keep all the 1-1 comps with same gender pairs. \n\nThe way they split the teams was also bs. Either have team leaders pick and distribute the women equally, or have 2 teams of all women go against each other.",

The hanging challenge was something that the women could excel at just as much as men, and many of them did really well. Then that leading into the way they organized choosing your opponent for the second challenge meant the women and smaller athletes had an ability to pick an opponent who was their size. And now that they're onto a team competition the women once again should be able to compete pretty fairly.\n\nI like that they're really trying, instead of just saying \"okay we're just gonna cast big giant men\" and not even bothering.",

And most of the men who picked women (except for 1) won.\n\nThen with the teams challenge, almost no one wanted women on their team, so 3 of the less than 10 women left ended up on the last team that had all the stragglers the other team leaders didn't select. \n\nLooks pretty bleak for a female contestant imo.\n\nNot to mention if the most fit/athletic woman hypothetically did make it to the final, she will have a hard time beating the most fit/athletic man in almost anything not specifically designed for her skill set and even then he might still have a physical advantage.",

Omg and he hugged his torso before smashing it and wished his opponent good luck in the rest if the competition. What a sweet man. \n\nI always think of chun li from street fighter when i hear kim chun ri's name lol. The mma fighter using techniques on her was so hard to watch, esp w that smug ass face of his. Pick a man next time you loser. His win rate in his own sport isn't even that high.

That whole encounter was so respectful, it warmed my heart \ud83e\udd7a\n\nI wonder if the whole series was just one day of filming? The hanging plus all the 1-1 matches would have taken under two hours. Let's make it 4-5 hours including the set up time and all the people walking into the arena. Clearly it's still the same day and they are moving onto quest 2 already. \n\nUgh so unfair that the team captains didn't get to pick! Teams 1, 2, and 3 will be the strongest won't they?\n\nPoor team 10 \ud83e\udd72 getting chosen as last team captain was a bigger disadvantage than an advantage\n\nThe male pole dancer looks like a younger hipster choo sung hoon lol \n\nObvi no one wanted to work w the mma guy who took out chun ri! \n\nTeam 10 is so relatively tiny and female dominant \ud83e\udd72\n\nThe editing is making it seem like team 10 will win! I wonder what the next challenge is!  Maybe flexibility or endurance?\n\nOoof team 10 is really struggling w the weight of the sand tho. Team 2 is carrying 2 at a time like they're nothing.\n\nOf course another cliffhanger \ud83d\ude11 i hate netflix lol",

He didn't have the fighting spirit, but he was definitely graceful in defeat.  \n\n\nThe smug MMA guy went for an easy win, which I wouldn't mind, since a lot of money is on the line, but he made himself look awful with his attitude. That being said he was still holding back. Other contestants did a lot more than what he did.  \n\n\nSexyama's fight with the other MMA fighter was pretty cool. Nothing crazy, but I loved the sportsmanship.  \n\n\nDon't be fooled by the editing, Team 2 definitely carried a lot more, even though they made it look like it was very close.  \n\n\nI knew it was going to be another cliffhanger and it's going to be the same in the next 2 episodes.

Maybe rotate the packing the stair crew half way through because one is all arms and one is more legs. I would do smaller bags and focus more on speed. Those big dudes were totally gassing out by the end.",

    "postText": "They have been partners on Runningman before, but seeing them on Hangout with Yoo and Sixth Sense showcases their relationship more. I like how Jessi is frank and blunt and how YJS reacts to it. It looks like he is trying to be better in English too. On Sixth Sense, she mentions how YJS is like a dad to her. She seems to be worrying about his health. In that song with Dawn, she name drops YJS.\n\nAlso Jaesuk really does look skinny, hopefully everything is alright.",

It's the same with KJK.\n\nBoth of them have known him long enough to be like \"lol don't mess with me, I was there when you were a nobody\" and YJS can't say ANYTHING against that\n\nAnd Jessi is probably the most able to mimic that because she also just doesn't care/has that image of confidence to do something without thinking necessarily about the repercussions of it",

I'm guessing that's considered fairly rude because Kyuhyun got backlash for doing that a few years ago (he apologized). But you look at YJS now and no one would dare do that to him so it really is impressive how far he's come with sheer hard work and good work ethic. And he makes sure to treat his hoobaes well because he knows what it's like, mad respect. Kinda relates to the Jessi thing because he understands how hard she tries and what it feels like to be nervous.",

To Jessi, i feel like Jae Suk is someone that she loves and cares about as a friend, but on top of that, she respects him as a person and as a professional. In her eyes, i think Jae Suk is someone really well respected by everyone, someone that knows how the industry works and probably can give her good and useful tips/advices for her career. I think she trusts his word/opinion and is kind of a father/teacher for her in a lot of ways because of it. That's probably why he is the only person that can make her go quiet and why she is always asking his opinion on her appearance on the episode, as she said on KB and SS. She was known before and all this success she is having now came primarily because of her comeback with Nunu Nana, but working with Jae Suk in different shows and him saying good things about her is making wonders for her image in sk with the gp.",

            "comment": "While Jessi and Yoo Jae Su's dynamic is entertaining, I like how clingy and sweet Jessi has been with female cast members who are older than her.  Like Somin, Lee Hyori, and Um Jung Hwa. \n\nI used to have a bad impression of Jessi...a long time ago, but she was just a kid back then.  And now as an adult, it's interesting to see how different she is now compared to her appearance on Unpretty Rapstar.  Actually, it was her [appearances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DABDZcExtBM) on '[The World of Dave\ub370\uc774\ube0c'](https://youtu.be/_MDr5rzHcdg?t=794) that really changed how I perceive her. She grew up for the better so it's nice to see her do well.\n\nAlso, my 70-year-old mom, like the panel of moms on 'My Little Old Boy', thinks she's hilarious.",

Now they're dynamics have evolved to a level where they are joking around with each other and he plays off of her jokes. I like this new dynamic better coz it isnt monotone",

So many to choose from, but idk if they are planning it or wat the criteria is/was, thot it was hiphop/r&amp;b females but later on i had doubts. Just need that and maybe a second season of queendom too.",

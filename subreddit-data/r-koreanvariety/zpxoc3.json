Seon Ho is fitting in quicker than expected and he's also picking up the bad habits this early. LOL Chan Song tried his best and he's probably a lot better in these games than Dindin. And Jung Hoon got so offended when &gt;! In Woo thought he is Se Yoon !&lt; - that was freaking hilarious. Fun episode all in all and they peaked at 13% this week. That said, I miss the cheeky choding Dindin.",

Mostly loved watching their competitive spirit during the flag game and KJM standing watch over his one free spot. \n\nThe dialogue between the members in the car was precious. It's SO GOOD when all the members are together and next week with Din Din should be even better. Just let their natural conversation flow and its wonderful tv.\n\nWhen I saw the donuts in the preview I was curious but could never have imagined how it would be used. KJM again for the win just trying to get past stage one with frozen feet. MSY torturing him even more. I laughed so hard and wish they hadn't edited so much of this as I loved watching everyone's expressions side by side. \n\nAmazing episode and welcome YSH. Heartwarming to see NIW go back to help him through. It's great to be back to 6 members again.",

Hard to believe that this was his very first filming because he showed no hesitation in interfering with the members.\n\nKJM was utterly hopeless with the iced footbath. It was amusing when MSY and NIW brought up his rough skin - if you\u2019ve seen his skincare routine in **My Little Old Boy** then you would know why: he just slaps slaps slaps the products aggressively on his skin \ud83d\ude02",

Cause like what most ppl mentioned iw does seem like he\u2019s still a guest. But i think bringing in someone niw is close to is a good decision, cause this will definitely bring the members closer. \n\nI know the ratings dipped, but i\u2019ve seen great responses to ysh\u2019s addition so i can only hope the show continues to succeed.\n\nFyi, i am a ksh fan who has stopped watching the show in full but only watching clips on youtube/twitter. Ksh mentioned 2d1n multiple times during his fanmeeting so it was kinda heartwearming and i know for sure he would want only the best for the show, and i do hope the show will go on for as long as possible and maybe eventually all of them can be back on the show one day.",

Doesn't it bring back memories and that creates a weird vide? \n\nOther than that, it's surprising that the members and Seonho quickly adapt to each other.

Here is a link to the raw if anyone is interested [https://kokoatv.net/episode/\ubb49\uccd0\uc57c-\ucc2c\ub2e4-\uc2dc\uc98c-2-88\ud654/](https://kokoatv.net/episode/\ubb49\uccd0\uc57c-\ucc2c\ub2e4-\uc2dc\uc98c-2-88\ud654/)\n\nI didn\u2019t watch the whole episode today due to lack of time but I did watch the highlights on Youtube. They did well today. What I got from the ep:\n\n&gt;!\\- today\u2019s match was used by Ahn Jung Hwan to choose the players who will be in the lineup of the first provincial rematch. From my understanding, he\u2019ll be doing this regularly now. I guess that\u2019s better than just being taken out of the whole thing\u2026 !&lt;\n\n&gt;!\\- Lee Hyungtaik, Kim Junhyeon, and Lee Jangkeun are out of the roster. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!EDIT: it seems like this will be the regular team, I was mistaken (although LHT asked Hyunwoo if he didn\u2019t plan on going to his wrestling match, which conflicts with the next soccer sched, so it felt like this roster was just for the next rematch). Comments said there would be a call up system for when there are absent members or injuries? I don\u2019t know how that would work out tbh\u2026 Will Jangkeun and Junhyeon and Hyungtaik keep up with their football training when it\u2019s uncertain they will ever be called up again? They do have regular jobs\u2026 Junhyeon is a coach for the skeleton team, Jangkeun also coaches (and he\u2019s getting married lol just wanted to share), and Lee Hyungtaik was just named director of MBN Tennis (not sure if like the entertainment department or they have a non-professional company team). !&lt;\n\n\\-&gt;!What I am most curious about is what happens to the players who were absent today like Junho and Wonwoo?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!\\- It was a little awkward to watch as everyone was hoping for their own inclusion, but they couldn\u2019t be that happy about it in consideration of their buddies that didn\u2019t get in. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!\\- At least I know it isn\u2019t scripted because it truly looked like the two younger players were about to cry while Hyungtaik looked mad - though obv they understood.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt one point, I honestly thought Ahn Jung Hwan would go through the whole episode without cracking a single smile or laugh haha. I hope there\u2019s at least some content that will help me get to know the new players, aside from their time on the field. It\u2019s been a while since I had a \u201cwho\u2019s this guy again\u201d moment on this show, and I just couldn\u2019t remember them from the auditions. Odd because I didn\u2019t have trouble remembering players after the first and second auditions.\n\nWhat did you guys think? \ud83d\ude42",

Acknowledge there were instances where his defenses were lacking but definitely better ball control and his through passes to Namkyu ( generally so good dynamics between the two) and other players generally led to some good attacks to the goal ( I dont follow soccer much so apologies for any random terminology)\n\nTaebum is a good for variety shows but yeh if anything Junhyeon probably wouldve done better in his position like \"attacking winger?\".",

I chance upon this thread curious about if they would really eliminated the current team for newer players...  \n\n\nWTF why is Jun Hyeon out??? I always thought he was one of the better players. Dude has got speed and pretty decent passing and vision for the pass down the flanks.   \n\n\nIf anything it should have been:   \n1. Mo Tae-bum Tae Bum (he is just there for comedic effect, he does not have the talent nor confidence to do well in this sport)   \n2. Kim Jun-ho (dude is obv not as interested anymore compared to the rest, he has been stagnant skill wise for almost half a year now..he doesn't show enough)  \n3. Lee Jang-kun (poor dude lost confidence maybe due to multiple positional changes and a run of poor performance, went from hero to zero)  \n4. Lee Ji-hwan (I don't think he should be kicked but what's the point of recruiting someone you have no intention of using while constantly picking poor performers. I get that this guy is a-bit boring and does not attract much screen time but football ability wise he is actually pretty decent and hardworking)  \n5. Kim Dong-hyun and Lee Hyung-taik will never be good enough as keepers. But they are too big of a personality to be kicked. I think if I have to pick one it would be Kim Dong Hyun, dude is more interested in trolling and being funny than actually being better for the team. There is no point having 3 goalkeepers.   \n6. Controversial opinion but I think all of the currently active sportsman like Kim Hyeon-woo, Cho Won-woo should not be on the show. They are only there 60% of the time and the better ones walk right back into the team in an important game when they are back lol. I would be mad as someone that comes week in week out and train hard but to start behind a half committed member even if they had no choice. Unless you're like Ryu Eun-gyu that despite being active still commits and rarely misses and still being good enough then it's fine.",

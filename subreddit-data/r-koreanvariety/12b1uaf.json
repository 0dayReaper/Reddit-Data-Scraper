    "postText": "&gt; What if Paik Jong Won suddenly gets dropped off in a completely new country? Paik Jong Won is the top restaurateur in Korea. However, if he were to find himself in a country on the other side of the world where they don\u2019t know anything about Korean food, will he be able to run a business and survive? In a place where he doesn\u2019t speak the language and has no popularity to rely on, he must build a business from the ground up. Nothing is scripted and everything is one-hundred percent real. Will Paik Jong Won be able to reach world-class fame with his food business? The story of the Business Genius\u2019 new store opening begins now. \n\nCast: \n\n* Baek Jong Won\n* Lee Jang Woo\n* John Park\n* Yuri\n* BamBam\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Info/Torrent|Stream|Subtitles|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|[Here](https://torrentsee158.com/topic/274779)|[VIU](https://www.viu.com/ott/ph/en/vod/2115336/The-Genius-Paik)|[Yes](https://anonymfile.com/NVA62/english-the-genius-paik-ep-1-downsubcom.srt)|",

His experience and professionalism helps negates the anxiety I get from watching him and the crew challenge themselves in opening a food stall in a market with so few resources and a language barrier. \n\nUnlike Youn's or similar shows in a similar vein where watching the cast interact amongst themselves and the guests is the main draw, this show is more of a proper challenge/survival show. You don't get the nicely edited segments and a lot of scenic downtime, but instead get more of the hard labor and the tiring process to get to the point where they can serve the customers. \n\nI wasn't planning on watching this cuz I didn't think I needed this kind of tension in my k-variety shows but it's been a nice surprise. I can't wait to see him tackle the hardships, get immersed in the many different cultures and see where his experience and the staff's help can take this concept.",

It is a little tension immersed shows but you can trust PJW and his vast knowledge of food to work around every problem.",

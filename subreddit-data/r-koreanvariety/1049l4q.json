After some thought would like to add that watching a culture (in my case Korea) with such a long, intact history - a singular deep tap root - makes me wonder how that would impact my 'self'. I am from the US which, as a country, is only 246 years old. Now it feels as though the US has no true national identity and very few real traditions. Of course the same may be true in reverse as one can imagine that living in culture in which pretty much everyone act the same one might wonder what it would be like to experience a place where there are many differences. Mono-culture could be at times constricting and at others comforting. Still working on these thoughts.",

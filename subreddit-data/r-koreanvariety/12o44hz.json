            "comment": "Alright, just got done watching this episode. I really don't wanna \"review\" or critique it. I'll just share some positive thoughts: \n\n1. Loved loved loved seeing JaeSuk and SukJin standing in their backstage room in front of the TV like SoMin's dads/uncle just to watch her perform Love Dive and gushing about her all the time. \ud83d\ude2d \n\n2. Sukjin is a true star. I simply do not understand how anyone dislikes this man. His presence is necessary, and it shows every single episode and every time they interact with fans. He is just as important to running man as JaeSuk. \n\n3. JaeSuk is one of the busiest people ever, and he still somehow found the time to practice a very difficult dance routine and rapping to a song by a bunch of 20-somethings! \n\n4. JaeSuk sitting SoMin and SeChan down was like a dad who was gonna lecture his kids because if their poor performance on a math test. \ud83d\ude02 It reminded me of him telling Chul Min on Sixth Sense (S1 final) to end the shoot Because \"the kids (SoMin and MiJoo) need to go study\". \ud83d\ude02\n\n5. YSC pulling off the chair thing was actually impressive. \n\n6. It's not at all surprising that the people who were actually at one point singers and performed on stage did well (HaHa and his F word swag, KJK, YSC, JSJ) but it's still admirable. However, the others deserve some applause here too. Like I said with YJS, he put in so much despite his schedule and age. He might not be the best dancer, he might not look cool, but he sings well and he definitely knows how to work a crowd. SoMin is out of this world. One of the fans was holding up a sign that said \"it's a crime to be this beautiful, SoMin\". \ud83d\ude02 It is, cause I'm dead and she killed me several times. \n\n7. SoMin. This girl... Not sure how familiar people are with her outside of RM, but if you watch an interview with her that isn't on a variety show (where she is expected to be a character), she is shy, quiet and reserved. She probably also has bad memories from their last overseas fan meeting (Vietnam) so she must have been terrified. Yet, she overcame her nerves with ease and seriously stole the show every time she was on stage. She looked gorgeous in all the looks. Her dance and performances were so good, even the oppas couldn't make fun of her. Like YJS said, she is an actress and a damn good one at that so of course she can handle some parts of this - but the other parts, she did it by hard work and talent. A true entertainer. She looked so good doing those two cover dances. I don't think people understand why a huge deal it is to be this good at it having NO background or training in this (she was never an idol trainee, that is just a misconception brought on Because she is so good people just can't believe she wasn't) and this not being her main job or expertise. She's also not a theatre actress, so even being on stage is a huge deal and must be terrifying. So, really, my hats off to Jeon SoMin, truly running man's idol. \ud83d\udc4f \n\nLike most, I wish there would have been more behind the scenes especially of their practice.",

There was a massive hate wave on Somin when she first joined in my country, due to so-called Running Man fans seeing the group literally as \"idol\"-like figures, telling that she is way over the top or something. At that point, the hate is still too strong, and some of them madnessly come to the concert and shout Somin out and a bunch of more idiotic stuff. There are Somin's fan there to support her but they were the minority.  \nGladly that they were to over the top that even now non RM fans called them out.  From 2021 until now thing got better in Vietnam. The hate fan still exists but they are not as much as the past now, and Somin's fans got a lot bigger (and stronger) now, just like her.",

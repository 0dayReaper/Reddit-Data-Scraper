    "postText": "For the last 2 weeks, 2 of my favourite variety shows appear to have been cancelled. I love to watch \"Return of the Superman\" and \"I Live Alone\". Normally, I can watch them on my provider on a Saturday, but for the last 2 weeks it's not been on. Is it because of the football? When can I expect to see them again.",

I understand why they had to do it for GHSMC, same for shows like The Great Escape and even Busted (although this one is a bit too egregious for my tastes). I still very much liked GHSMC but it kind of felt like they had to make the theme work for all the members and throughout the whole season, which is understandably hard. Crime Scene works well cuz we get new roles every week and it's done on a smaller but much more detailed scale so we get to immerse in the scenes better. So glad we're getting a S4 and fingers crossed it stays on a similar level or even better quality than before.",

Studio Slam, the SLL label, will take over the production and air it on TV at the end of this year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;'Crime Scene' is a season-based mystery entertainment program of JTBC that started broadcasting in 2014.

It really puts it into perspective. However, I always find it fun to see all of them arguing about who is more youthful. Especially Haha and his neverending quest to be hip and young \ud83d\ude02\n\nI was also shocked when they pointed out that Park Myungsoo was the eldest with the \u201cgrandfather\u201d nickname at the start of Infinity Challenge but was around the same age as Running Man\u2019s current maknaes.

With each passing time, it's easy to feel we might've wasted our life and there are things we probably miss out on. \n\nThoughts like: \"I should've done certain things differently\", \"I should've try harder\", \"Is this all there's to life?\", \"Is this how I'm going to live the rest of my life?\" etc\u00b2. \n\nThen, you feel even more at odds when you live in a fast-paced environment. Seeing how the people around you, seemingly, living their life to the fullest. I imagine, it gives great relief and comfort to know that there are other people living the same life as you. Knowing that you're not off track...\n\nWell, on a cheery note, I like the 'nap' time. So many gold moments from YJS bragging about catching the bug to \"flaming youth\".",

                    "comment": "Their comments earlier about the maknae duo being like \"flaming youth\" and them talking about how looking back everyone seemed old but now they look young was also deep. It's rare to see, but I always enjoy when these people get serious about something. They've lived very interesting lives. I love hearing their thoughts and ideas. \n\nIt's always like that though. KJK said at 30, a 36 year old seemed like an ajhussi (middle aged man). But now when he looks back, he looks like a kid to him. It really just is all about perspective. But I also felt what SoMin said. Chasing after youth...\n\nI think they were laughing at the comment SJH made because she counted herself in the young people group. (They kept making fun of it, which is funny but I think she takes it seriously at times) Only JSM stood up for her. Although, her comment didn't make sense because she said she considers SJH young but Haha's not young because he's so much older than SJH. He's only 2 years older. \ud83d\ude02How can a 2 year age difference be a lot, but their 5 years age difference isn't? Bless her, at least she tried. I got sidetracked, I wanted to say... \n\nWell...they're pretty much all (even YSC and JSM almost and maybe even actually) middle aged. And I think that's part of the reason I like this show so much. I'd rather watch middle aged people do this than 20-somethings. Youth is overrated. Or at least I'd like to think so because I've basically wasted all of mine. I think it's just the pressure the world puts on us. Especially for women, which is why I even brought the earlier part up. I think at some point SJH even justified herself by saying \"it's because I'm not married\". We have these ideas of deadlines and milestones... Like you have to get married by 30 or you're never gonna do it! You have to have a child by 40 or you'll never do it. (Although, for this one - it's actually kind of true that pregnancy is more risky for men and women after a certain age) Just a lot of stuff we put pressure on ourselves to do by a certain age, and it's just not how life workds. \n\nLook at the last 3 years... We were locked away and in danger as a world. We lost 3 whole years. That could have been the 3 years someone managed to find the love of their life, get married, have a kid or two even, get a degree, get a certificate, move to another country, travel the world, lose weight, gain muscle, learn a new skill, etc. Yet, most of us just binge watched TV shows and spend hours on TikTok and made banana bread! \n\nIt's so weird going back and watching older episodes, It is strange to see them like that as someone who started watching the last 5 years - and they were all adults, so it's not like we got to watch kids grow up. Makes you think.",

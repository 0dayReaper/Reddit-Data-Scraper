Oh and the Divorced Singles series, that one has 3 or so seasons now.\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iyso9ql/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iz8ayph/**\n\n---\n\nBtw, there's **Secret Man and Woman (\ube44\ubc00\ub0a8\ub140)** for a lower budget version of Pink Lie. Oh and **REA(L)OVE** is the one where they actually have more scandalous/shocking/etc. secrets. It's set on an Okinawan island/resort, some people find the hosts really offensive and the show dark, but it's really funny, give it a chance.\n\nThough start with Terrace House: Boys and Girls Next Door as that's where it sorta all started for these East Asian dating shows. **This is kinda how to watch Terrace House: Boys x Girls Next Door: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zfkwnq/how_do_i_watch_boys_girls_next_door/izchnov/**\n\nOr maybe start with **Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City** as that's the one available in Netflix.\n\nDon't forget **Shanghai Sharelife (/r/Shanghaisharelife)** as that's the Chinese version of Terrace House, some people really like that (especially due to the panelists). There was actually kinda some cute or funny couples there too.",

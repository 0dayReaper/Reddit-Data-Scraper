    "postText": "Title Match Tour has ended? Maybe? Jeju Title Match might be the painful defeat yet but it doesn't put a stop to Eojjeoda Avengers journey. 5 victories out of 6 Title Matches are no joke, as time goes by we can see the growth and the weaknesses of our players. One did got away but the fighting spirits of Eojjeoda Avengers are above all else.\n\nBreaking The Seal in SEOUL! You must have thought that Title Match Tour was the hardest but guess what? The World Cup of Early Football is just around the corner! No time for missed pass and clumsy play. 2 months of intense training? Declared! Defense. Midfielder. Striker. No one can escape from Ahn Jung Hwan's eyes.\n\nThe selected 11 of 454 football teams, would Eojjeoda Avengers be able to tackle the obstacles? But before that, can they even survive the hell training?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I hope they pass the preliminary. If I'm not mistaken, season 1 ended with a competition, too. Eojjeoda Fc (old team) got second place. So maybe they will do the same for season 2?

They spent 8 weeks just to get what? 5 players. Poor planning, really.",

A lot of the players are missing out on the simplest things\u2014passing, positioning, etc. On top of that the Avengers are very simplistic strategically. One good example is their game against Shinjeju FC. Once they mentioned parking the bus, you could see that the game was going nowhere. I'm sure they'll continue to see strategies like this during the tourney. As much as AJH drills them through different set pieces and attacking patterns, at this point every player needs to have their basics down and a good enough intuition on the field, which is something the coaches can't put together during their weekly shoots. It's going to take a lot of individual practice from the players.\n\nI hope the players put all their best efforts into this tournament! Let's Go Avengers!\n\n(And hopefully the show will continue? It's a shame to end it here so close to the third audition....)",

They can't rely on Kyu-Gyu and Minho forever. Kyu-Gyu always got blocked during Title Match, which made it harder to score a goal. Other players need to be more aggressive when attacking. I can't wait to see what Park Jun Yong, Kim Yong Sik, Lee Jun Yi, and Jang Jeong Min have to offer.\n\nHopefully, they will continue the show forever. Even if they did end the show, hopefully, they will cast the same members again. (As long as Captain Nam Kyu is there, I'm gonna be okay).",

                            "comment": "Put simply, \"Parking the bus\" refers to a strategy where a team keeps almost all of its players in their own half when defending. They'll also pick the least risky attack option to prevent counterattacks from the opposing side. It's often used to protect a small lead or to play for a draw. When done well, it can basically kill the pace of the game.\n\nI honestly would rather have the show end on a high note than have them try to stretch the ratings. Maybe an awards ceremony or a banquet episode to close it off? Some way both the audience as well as the players &amp; staff can say their goodbyes. I don't like it when shows end without a finale, it makes me feel empty inside, haha.\n\nAs for another season, they never did say no to Donghyun's \"A Gentlemen's Punch\".....",

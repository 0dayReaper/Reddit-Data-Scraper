I think the memory restorations concepts are hit or miss for me depending on what it\u2019s about but it\u2019s a bit of a shame the members can\u2019t participate more in it. Sunrise part was also fun and it\u2019s good to see that the members will be together next episode, although it\u2019s in skit form lol.",

Lee Hyori, Park Hye Jin, Song Ji Hyo, etc. Stars that are not comfortable to show their bare face usually sleep and wake up in a face mask.",

Of course not the fake BS we've got with poorly done for TV or just straight up faked for TV but legit restorations by a auto-restoration business and home flipping by a legit flipper company. \n\nI also was so sure that the end with the early morning train ride was going to result in them being told that they are getting their phones and money taken away and having to find their own way home across the country. But, thinking about it, that wouldn't be fun cause they are such big celebrities that they'd easily get a fan to buy them a train ticket back to Seoul and then it would be over. Bummer cause that would be a great concept. Heck, that's a great concept for a show. Get some celebrities and fly them to other countries that wouldn't really recognize them, drop them in one city with nothing and give them a set time to reach their destination. Amazing Race celebrity edition but with no games and no clues.",

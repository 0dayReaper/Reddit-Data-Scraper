On this day, Kim Jong-min, Yeon Jeong-hoon, and Yoo Seon-ho, who visited Yangyang-gun, visited a nearby traditional market to prepare for a village feast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey stopped by an old cookie shop in a traditional market to sample snacks, and then put three bags of snacks they each chose on a scale. The bag containing the cookies weighed just over 1500 grams. The price per 100g of snacks was 4,499 won. It came out at ***68,569 won per bag***. However, the owner of the store asked for 70,000 won each. The performers who checked the price were embarrassed by the high amount. One bag was 70,000 won, three bags were 210,000 won.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe owner of the store quickly finished the packaging and called the price saying that he would cut it for 150,000 won. Then, the performers appealed to set it at 100,000 won. The boss drew a line saying that he ate a lot for the tasting, and that he could not reduce the price any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nn the end, the cast members bought the snack for 140,000 won through bargaining. This amount was close to half of the 300,000 won allowance received from the production crew. After the broadcast, various Internet communities posted criticisms of the store\u2019s overpriced prices and criticism of the traditional market, which was completely different from the market price.\r  \n\r  \nEventually, the Yeongyang-gun Office submitted clarification data on the 5th. Yeongyang-gun Office said, \u201cFirst of all, we deeply apologize to the viewers for such an unpleasant situation.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHowever, the Yeongyang-gun Office said, \u201cIt has nothing to do with the merchants of the Yeongyang Traditional Market,\u201d regarding the broadcast\u2019s gouging price controversy. merchant,\u201d he said.\r  \n\r  \nYeongyang-gun Office explained that \u201cYeongyang is a small and simple place where everyone is a relative.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the damage is entirely suffered by the Yeongyang Traditional Market merchants,\u201d he said. I respectfully ask you to do so.\u201d\n\n\\--------\n\nAfter the broadcast aired, many articles were posted on various online communities criticizing the store and pointing out the prices of the traditional market. Some netizens compared the price with old snacks sold in other markets.\n\nAlthough there are differences in each traditional market, traditional sweets are usually sold for 1,500 to 2,000 won per 100g. Traditional markets in other nearby areas sold old-fashioned snacks at 1,000 won per 100 grams, so the price was cheap. It has been confirmed that the shop on the air is 3-4 times more expensive.",

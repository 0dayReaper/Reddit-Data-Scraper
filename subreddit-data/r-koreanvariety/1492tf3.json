            "comment": "Is this the 3rd variety show Kwangsoo is on after Running Man? And also already at the 2nd season?  Its hard pressed to think that the accident or building his actor's image had anything to do with him leaving RM then. \n\nRecently someone posted a question on one of the official RM YT channel on why Somin and Kwangsoo unfollowed each other on IG before he left RM.  \n\nMany quickly gave answers to blame the girlfriend and his agency for him distancing himself away from Somin.  But when I gave my answer, it was deleted by the channel after  some seconds. While the other answers were left alone.  I tried answering again and this time it was deleted even faster!\n\nSo below is my answer,  which they feel HAD to be deleted immediately. \n\nI replied:\nTo the question why they unfollowed each other,  people blame the girlfriend or his agency. His girlfriend is a pretty chill person, you will know if you catch her on other shows. Also, most importantly, if u look at his IG, he is following other female celebs in his own agency that he is closely working with.  Also it has been several years. So the answers they give don't make sense.\n\n\n\nNow, I find it really interesting that they don't delete other false rumours or hate comments made under the same video but they delete this.  Which begs the question, what are they trying to cover up or hide? If not, why not just leave my comment alone?",

As if she has that big of a pull to influence screentime/format/cast lineup.\n\nLook, I'm not denying that there might be something that's going on between LKS and JSM (e.g. the IG part). But at the same time, LKS is/was the pillar of RM. For years, he had worked really hard and played a huge role in the show's success. \n\nAs such, it's impossible to imagine a new member (with only 3/4 years experience as a permanent cast member) can push-out an outstanding senior member of 11 years. \n\nIf anything LKS should has a bigger influence. Especially considering that the other five cast members had been working with him since the beginning",

Seems like pretty heavy stuff  to me. \n\nAlso, the variety shows he's involved in has him running and jumping and perspiring and he's off to do more of those.  If he's recovered, wouldn't the first thing he would do is to return to RM? \n\nAnd also if the reason, like someone say, is because signing on for RM again means a long commitment for him while the current variety shows works better for him because they work on short seasons,  then guesting on RM once in a while wouldn't be out of the question. But..he never did that, not even one episode.  In my lens, it just seems like he's avoiding RM.",

He seems to be more focused on finally relaxing a bit, healing his mind and body, and spending time with his girlfriend. I'm proud of him.",

    "postText": "Hello all, I am a regular viewer of a \"My Little Old Boy\". And I want to ask this question to all viewers of \"My Little Old Boy\". \n\nWhenever there is part in the episode involves Kim Joon Ho and Kim Ji Min dating life, I literally skip that part. And the reason for this is, according to me, it is not compatible with the theme/plot of \"My Little Old Boy\". I mean, I didn't sign up to watch this show to watch dating between middle aged people. If I really want to watch plot with dating/loveline, I would watch a proper dating show. Why would I watch this where a middle aged man try to do something for his girlfriend which he might not do in real life i.e. waking up in the middle of night to buy some bread along with someone who has no reason to be there except there is money/screen-time involved?\n\nI mean literally I am skipping these parts since last few months. I don't how many of you watched these. I mean, I started watching this show because it has unique theme/plot which gives us the insights into these celebrities' real life. And for that only I started watching this. \n\nNow, I know that not all of it is real, it is being driven by the writers/directors. And for this as well, the writers/directors are responsible. \n\nI think playing too many games is biggest reason for the drop in the viewer ratings but can this be as well one of the reasons? I would really love to know from you all.",

If the manager is not an interesting character, following around a manager's day job is quite mundane and repetitive. (Basically driving the celeb to schedules, taking photos and monitoring during schedules, etc.) So the limelight naturally falls back on the celeb.\n\nThe celebs are the main draw for OIV, especially if it is a celeb that doesn't typically go on variety shows. \n\nOnce in awhile there will be celebs who are close to their managers or celebs who treats their managers well or even managers that are entertaining enough to carry an episode. But those aren't common enough for a weekly on-going programme to just stick with the original premise of the show.\n\nMy current issue with OIV is that GookJu is gradually taking over the show and her schtick is just eating and eating. Rather than finding that things that she eats appetising, I fear for her health.",

            "comment": "Personally there are a multitude of reasons why I dropped the show and only pick interesting episodes to watch.\n\n- Kim Joon Ho. This guy basically took over programme as his personally skit / shit show. He's alright in small doses (back when Sangmin was leader) but straight up unbearable and not funny when he has too much screen time. Many of the following reasons as to why I dropped this show are largely caused by him as well.\n\n\n- Too many faux political struggle / power play over who is the leader and other positions. I feel like there was a period where every 2-3 eps there would be come sort of political struggle skit. It was okay the first time round but by the second time round, it got boring really fast. It's always the same over thing again. Which leads me to my next point.\n\n\n- Too many gatherings. The political struggle leads these gathering for votes. In the beginning, it was fun to watch as it brings in the more fringe members that don't appear much. I'm sure it brought up viewership the first couple of times round. But too many gathering in a short period of time gets stale. These gathering are usually dominated by a couple of the more vocal members like KJK, KJH, LSM, KHC. The rest are just reduced to being human props with little airtime.\n\n\n- Too many fringe members and semi-fringe members and too little core members. Currently there are too many \"members\" on the show. The only core members are KJH and LSM and maybe TJH. They basically permeate every segment of the show. I remember feeling irritating when I sat through a KJH + LSM segment only to see that the next segment is KJH + someone else. Then it's that same old schtick all over again. I don't understand why the 3 of them are given so much screentime since they have their own spin-off show (D4M). I would have thought that the reason for the spin-off is so that other members can have more screentime on MUD. Maybe the other members are too busy to commit too much on this show hence the 3 free-er, less popular members gets to appear so much. The semi-fringe members (KJK, KHC, DD, IWH) and fringe members (CJH, OMS, etc) are more entertaining and interesting to watch but most of them don't have their own segments anymore and the only time they appear are during the gatherings. \n\n\n- Mums Panel are disconnected from the members. In the distant past the mums used to watch their sons in their segments and their reactions and comments were funny. How the other mums empathized with each other were also funny. Up until recently none of the mums on the panel were watching their own sons. HKH's mum is a breath of fresh air, but HKH is too uninteresting / unfunny to watch. DD's mum is great but she doesn't really react much when it is not her son. (Maybe she is too polite to be judgey / mum-like reprimanding when it is not her son?) Tony's mum is too annoying and again too one-dimensional. Tony never ever had another segment again after his re-introduction. I think his segment is just a way for them to have a legitmate reason to put his mum on the panel.\n\n\n- Terrible editing and abrupt cuts. Some segments can span 3-4 weeks and at any one time there can be 3-4 on-going segments that is not concluded. It is really annoying to watch and follow especially if the other segments are very repetitive.\n\n\n- Too many recurring non-members that are just too one dimension. \"Long Hair Dirty Comedian with a dirty rooftop house\" and \"Past-his-prime Karate action star\" just to name a few. No one wants to watch KJH + 1 random member visit the dirty rooftop house every other week. It is the same format everytime. Visit, gets gross out, help to clean, discover yet another shockingly gross thing, order food, question the cleanliness of utencils / items from the house, eats with it anyway, leave.\n\n\n- The core tenet of the show has changed. It used to be mums' observing their sons' personal life. It was less scripted. Now it is basically a scripted skit show with half-assed game show elements. Maybe they are trying to differentiate themselves from other observational shows like ILA and OIV?\n\n\nThings were great right before KJH first made the bid to overthrow LSM as leader. There are 2-3 distinct but connected groups and there's a good mix of individual segments and small group outings. There were mostly core members with very few fringe members. So it is easy to be more invested in the show.\n\nCurrently the show is a joke and I wouldn't watch it even when I ran out of stuff to watch. I would only pick out interesting episodes to watch when I see an article about it. The PD and Writer are just straight up lazy at this point. They need to trim the members and reform with different core members.",

They even touched upon it briefly on the show when KJH joined and did his zombie thing and now HKH snuck in his catchphrases. And to add to that, they both fall into very set \u201ccharacters\u201d with KJH doing the power hungry, kinda lame unfit ahjussi, now lovebird thing. HKH has really clung to trying to be KJK\u2019s rival and third wheel for KJH &amp; Jimin. \n\nWhereas I really enjoyed discovering unexpected gems like Won Hee, Seok Yong and Bakgoon and seeing normal sides to known actors like Jin Hyuk. Or even someone unique and living their life in an interesting way like Bae Jung Nam. I wish they included more of the new random guests and follow them and potentially see if anyone is good member material.",

But I don't think it's his fault but more of writers and PDs. They thought it might be a good thing. Then there was controversy that KJH started giving chances to other fellow comedians who were under him, such as the one who went on a date with Oh Min Suk.\n\nI think before KJH joined everything was much more natural but later everyone started playing games, elections, etc. And it lost a plot. \n\nIDK I'll keep watching right now and will definitely skip the part where KJH and KJM loveline be shown.",

I agree it doesn't  have anything to do with why we watch the show and honestly I wish he would be leave.  Sang Min is on all the time too but he is eccentric enough that I don't get as bored of him and he doesn't grate on my nerves as much.   \n\nI also skip all the Joon Ho and Jimin segments and sometimes skip whole episodes when it features  Joon Ho and Sangmin going off to do something together alone.",

I think they are all very pleasant, but the original premise of the show has been lost. There is no son on the show I feel invested with that I think is going to or even trying to find marriage. Moms are just the audience now laughing and reacting at the games and skits.\n\nWon Hee seems to be the only one truly still waiting to find his wife. But his interactions with single women is cringeworthy \n\nTo me, it feels like Jun Ho and Sang Min are the shadow PDs. But I guess all shows need to evolve in order to remain on air. I still watch it regularly but I also fast fwd a lot of segments. Especially the openings with the guests and in between segments when they get guest and mom reactions.",

Tak Jae Hoon clearly mentioned a couple of times that he is not interested that much. Kim Jong Kook says he \"should\" get married but he \"doesn't want\" to IMO. Regarding remaining others, I am not sure exactly as they are not on this show for all long time, so can't say.\n\nRegarding I'm Won Hee, I agree that he is really pathetic when it comes to dating, we have seen on this show as well. But that's the essence of this show that it shows you different sides of these celebs which no one ever has seen. Who would have realised that a celeb like Im Won Hee who is charismatic on screen can be living such a pathetic life. And that's what this show gives to the audience and that's what the premise of this show is. \n\nRegarding the mothers, I totally agree with you that DinDin's and Kyeong Hwan's mothers are just there being audiences. But IMO, I don't think DinDin and Kyeong Hwan are the kind of celebs that are having difficulties in getting married, it's just that they are not really interested in getting married at this stage of their lives. The only reason I think they are on this is to make it entertaining, that's it. That's their job and that's what they are doing. \n\nOne point I want to make here is that even these celebs date someone they are not going to do that in front of the camera until they are ready to commit to the relationship and ready to take it to the next level like Kim Joon Ho did. He was trying hard to pursue Kim Jim Min and once they both were committed to the relationship then only they announced to the world that they are dating. So similarly even if all other remaining members are not showing any signs of dating on camera, I am sure they must be trying behind the camera and once they find someone then they might let everyone know on this show. I still remember once Lee Sang Min mentioned during Tarot Card reading that he is interested in some woman and when Tak Jae Hoon asked who she was that he replied that he won't tell him and we still don't know who she was and what happened between them after that. \n\nSo if these celebs are really interested in someone I don't think they will ever show that on screen. They will date that person behind the screen but until they are ready for the next level they won't mention that on screen.",

He said it so many times actually but it's hard to find the right person especially at his age. \nI mean we are talking about marriage here, it's not easy at all..",

Now, they added many comedians on the show so now it makes it look like a \"comedy skit\" where they get together and they games.",

They\u2019re suppose to be comedians but Tak Jae-hun is funnier. I also hate that people are a part of the main cast without their mother\u2019s joining. The mothers are a big treat to me. Maybe they can add about two celeb women to the mix. I miss Hong Jin Young and her sister.",

Basically ratings for all variety shows are down even for 1D2N.",

Even though I'm sure the scenarios were planned, it felt more natural bc they are actually friends and it wasn't putting celebrities who don't hang out in real life together constantly.",

Why\u2019s heechul, siwon are barely on the show? Like the funny ppl are not even on the show anymore. It kinda has became sang min and hun ho show, which is boring most of the time. If this keeps going like that, the show will be cancelled soon, they need to get their sht together. And pls FOR THE LOVE OF GOD we don\u2019t need updates of Jun ho\u2019s relationship like they\u2019re really ruining the point of the show. Everything he does for seems fake to me cuz that man is known for being lazy and the fake waking up in the morning is ridiculous and annoying. They can go and do that sht on other show.

It's too dangerous especially if you don't want to hurt anybody. \n\nJust troll the response or answer as best as it could be without ruining the vibe, lol.\n\nHaneul's probably just teasing Hanu. Because her reaction to Taeyang's stripper/dancing secret was like the most wide-eyed, lmao. But ya, she could be more understanding of him if she has a similar secret, like in terms of severity or similar line of work.\n\nBecause unless they're allowed to choose nobody, she's probably picking Hanu or Taeyang. Or actually Hangyeol since they said that Haneul talked to Hangyeol quite a bit.",

            "comment": "Not sure if everyone felt the same way but this episode was hard on the heart...\n\nI felt a cloud over me the entire time I was watching and towards the end it felt suffocating..\n\nIt's as though I was living vicariously through the eyes of some of these contestants and feeling all their emotions..\n\nI can imagine how terrified Hanui must be feeling about how everyone would view her once her lie is out in the open. Already none of the guys are into her romantically and after her lie is revealed, i'm not sure how they will perceive her and react to her.. Hope they will treat her with even more respect thereafter..\n\nFor sure there will be shocks and awe, but I think or rather I hope that this won't change the friendships they all have for one another.\n\nFinal observations -\n\n1. Chansol and Dahae look to be the most set and likely to choose each other. Chansol looks like he has accepted Dahae despite her lie. The only question is how will Dahae react once she finds out about his?\n2. Hangyeol and Seulbi would choose each other. Hangyeol seems to be in a bind betw Daon and Seulbi but him redrawing that portrait of her shows that he is that bit more into her rather than Daon who just misses the boat with everyone. That's some effort right there if you are interested in someone.\n3. As for Daon, nothing seems to be going right for her. Her timing with all the other guys is all over the place and I feel bad for her. I wish her nothing but the best outside of this show.\n4. Haneul and Hanu would pick each other. Hanu for sure would pick Haneul despite what happened in this episode. Whether you like him or not for how he goes about playing the game, what's true is that he did stick to his principles aka dating everyone, and then finding out whom he really likes, and then tying up the loose ends (even though that LP thinghy with Daon was just... nvm. Perhaps that's just his way of tying up loose ends. Not everyone would find that in good taste.\n5. For Haneul I just feel that she was just trying to spice it up with her answers during the game. That completely threw a curve ball to everyone including myself because that's so uncharacteristic about her. But considering the nature that she brought onto the show, she did gravitate towards Hanu mostly and my gut is that she will stick with that and choose him eventually. I am most curious about her lie.\n6. Bareum isnt great at the dating game but he sure is marriage material. Outside of the show, I hope he does find someone who would love him for who he is. This is the kinda guy who doesn't play games with ppl's feelings and is truthful in his feelings. I feel that Seulbi led him on with her overnight date choice, doing exactly what Hanu did to Hanui. I personally don't think that's right. She should have been more honest because I think Bareum will get hurt badly once he finds out the truth.\n7. As for Taeyang, i think he will be fine. I think he has already made his mind up that even if he ends up with no one on the show, life is still gonna go on. I personally think he's a rather nice guy who knows what he wants, but his emotions get the better of him. If he can learn to master his emotions and consider others' feelings before his, he will be a very attractive person. I still don't approve of his choice of career though, and if I was a girl, there is no way I'd have my partner continuing in a career like that.  \n\n\nJust my humble opinion! I don't care if I be wrong or right\\~ Looking forward to the final episode with this cliffhanger of a feeling... Please give us viewers a proper proper closure to this rollercoaster ride... JAEBAL!!!",

I feel so bad for Hanui. Bruh in one hand you have a secret that one girl is a rich girl VS on the other hand one girl used to work in adult movies, it's not the same just cause it's called a pink lie.\n\n&amp; can we take a moment to acknowledge how much of a pussy Han Gyeol really is, during the game when Bareum asked him if he's gonna be his competition for  Seulbi, he didn't give a direct answer. But then going on to trying to win her over drawing her and stuff ugh. Flashback to him not telling Taeyang the real reason why he didn't wake him up when he asked him.\n\nI think I will get a lot of hate for this. So i don't blame Daon for whatever those guys think about her, but I was dying of cringe when she suddenly said she liked Hangyeol like chotto matte. He had a bad impression about her where he also implied she's playing all the guys and now she's saying how much she likes him just a day after she confessed to Taeyang!? \nIt's not like she'll get a penalty for staying single. It felt so forced.",

I liked it when he told Hangyeol off when he blamed Daon for his feelings. \n\n- I feel so bad for Hanui. Feels like she\u2019s being used as a bait and then thrown away :( She looks like she felt betrayal. Because I would too. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nice for the crew to not give them a heads up before revealing it to everyone before selection day. There are people like Hanui, Haneul, Hanu, and Bareum initially, who are very cautious and anxious about their lie. \n\n- It\u2019s also lowkey frustrating that Hangyeol still has 2 people on his mind. Thankfully Dahae reminded him that there is no time left. He really needs to pick up speed. \n\n- Dahae and Chansol are so cute!!!!!",

Apart from Dahae, it feels like all the women can't wait for this to be over. They'll choose someone because they have to, and then they may never talk to that guy again outside of the show.\n3. Taeyang is another good example of this. Great respect. He shot his shot, but ended up choosing his self-respect, and he's done. No more games, no more pretending to like someone- even with Haneul, it's clear his mindset is 'she's the best of the rest, but I'm not really interested'. BTW, Taeyang is the biggest drinker there. Haneul is always drinking water.\n4. Hangyeol seems really genuine. You can't fake those tears. He just seemed overwhelmed that he finally was in play. I don't think he cares about Daon anymore, though.\n5. I can kinda understand why Hanu gave the LP back. If Haneul and he were in a real relationship, do you really think he wants to explain why he's keeping it?\n6. Bareum, you're a great guy. Stop taking it so seriously. Seulbi isn't choosing anyone long-term. That also means she'll likely choose you. Again, don't take it too seriously.\n7. Chansol and Haneul's secrets have been deliberately left out. We've already seen Chansol's on Reddit, which I think they kept a secret because if the viewers knew it, they'd think Dahae and Chansol were a sure thing. And that couple already looks way too much like a sure thing.\n8. I'm amazed, and thankful that Haneul went from being a fly on the wall, to the main character in the last few episodes.\n9. Haneul's secret- it's clear the producers are left with one last major piece of tension- Hanu-Haneul-Taeyang, and they want to milk it as much as possible. Part of that tension is keeping Haneul's secret, a secret.\n10. FWIW, my final guess is that Haneul's secret is that she is divorced, with a strong likelihood that she also has a kid. It has to be big enough that Haneul wants to make sure she's picking the right person- she even said as much. Hanu and Haneul talked about it, and the hosts even had a poll about it among themselves. Divorce is evidently a big deal in Korea. A child, even bigger. Honestly, this would be an even bigger secret than Hanui's if it were true.\n11. I'm almost glad that nobody chose Hanui. I would hate for her to be ditched after the reveal.",

Everyone else had tamer lies.\n\nImagine if this was like **REA(L)OVE** (Japanese dating show, wait wtf the subreddit for it is called https://www.reddit.com/r/a:t5_ivfdr/), nobody would be feeling left out, well not as much as the case of Hanui.\n\nLegit REA(L)OVE had real secrets, even if trolled, like it's been half a decade now and so I've forgotten wtf all of them were but fam, just watch the ending scenes and it's mindfuckingblowing. Because you couldn't have guessed it at all, there were way too many cast members plus they only filmed for like 5 days or so, so no screen time for anybody.\n\nOh shit, I just took it in, Hanui might've thought they'd do it like REA(L)OVE where they tell the secret right when they choose their partner. As in, still in front of everyone but not in a casual way like inside their temporary living room. So that's why she might've been distraught if she'd watched REA(L)OVE, hmm.\n\n---\n\nYup, just heartbroken for Hanui. Her whole setup is so sad because if they had at least two or so of the male housemates as older than Hanui (or if the overall age of the group was closer to Hanui), they might've been more understanding of her past career. \n\nMaybe if Hanui was less forward, or if she wore what attire Daon was hinting at (when Daon was arguing with Taeyang, with Hanu beside Hanui) that would've almost for sure (Daon's words) at least enamored one of the male housemates. It might've been different then.\n\nIt was like a video/clip of maybe Hanui playing with her hair right. It was during that night argument scene for Episode 7 and it wasn't that blurred out IIRC.\n\nProducers always do these older girls disservice as they have to be like Ming from Shanghai Sharelife (the Chinese version of Terrace House): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY2x4Y8W8lU&amp;t=62s. Or now from Love Catcher in Bali: &gt;!Taeeun!&lt;. \n\nOtherwise, they'd be ignored/sidelined/etc. even once the age reveals are out. Like choice of words/slang/etc., crow's feet around the eyes, fashion, et cetera can be easy signifiers and such. And so the explicit disclosure of their age is just the final nail.",

Hopefully he will appeal to someone who watched the show or even better if he just gains some confidence. I\u2019m really rooting for him in the long run.\n\n\u2728I am so sad about Hanui. I feel like she put a lot on the line appearing on such a public show and revealing her secret - but her risk didn\u2019t work out because she hasn\u2019t really bonded with anyone. I feel like even with the girls; she bonded relatively less than the others. It was extremely difficult to see a bunch of over excited adults jumping around while they can visible see her afraid and no one consoling her until she starts to cry. I found it seriously heartbreaking. I hope that she doesn\u2019t get hurt - I cannot imagine anyone in the cast making her feel worst for it so I\u2019m hoping that she will be okay.\n\n\u2728gosh\u2026I did not really feel bad for Daon in the last episode but I kind of did this time. Honestly speaking I wish that she just chose not to be with anyone. I think the guys spouting their nonsense opinion to her is uncalled for, but I do think she definitely tends to promote misunderstanding - whether intentional or not, no one else but her knows. Daon makes me uncomfortable because I genuinely believe she had a very strong involvement in all her relationships being messed up. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong at all for her to want to try out being with all the guys, my issue is that I do feel like she led them on - and when one fails, she goes for the next and the next etc.\n\n\u2728 I am SINCERELY looking for reasonable and honest answers here - but can someone explain to me why Taeyang is unliked in the fandom? I am coming from a place of wanting to understand for real.\nI see him as a really nice guy - he might be a bit babyish but I feel like he\u2019s genuine, not coy at all, and a relatively okay guy. But I actually see people grouping him with Hanu of all people\u2026like why?\n\n\u2728the whole French Fry game really confused me. I have no idea what Hanuel is thinking and it\u2019s making me so curious LOL. I am almost definitely sure she is not into Taeyang because of the obvious A. Her reaction to watching his lie and B. During the trip, he was not her first or second choice, which makes it hard to believe she cares for him. \nI have a feeling she\u2019s teasing Hanu or trying to piss him off, I have no idea. Could it be that she is testing him because he said no matter what he would choose her in the end? I dunno lol\n\n\u2728this might be unpopular opinion but I quite dislike Hangyeol. I feel like every episode there\u2019s something he says which makes me grossed out, but this week it was when he said to Daon \u201cI hoped that your overnight trip with Taeyang would not go well\u201d\u2026. Like who the eff says that? And then to end up pursuing Seulbi anyway - like it was unnecessary.\n\nAnyway that\u2019s my ramble, I was so frustrated and emotionally exhausted watching this episode so I had to let it out.",

                    "comment": "Let\u2019s assume Daon does promote misunderstanding, is she the only one in the pink house who does that? Why do they think the best way to clear out misunderstandings is to confront her that way and call her names? Yes, when one fails she tries somewhere else. May not seem right but if you look at the situation it wasn\u2019t like she was moving without reasons or she had the intention of hurting anyone. She had a crush on HG, he picked someone else. She had a nice date with Hanu, he downplayed it and said he wanted to see other people. She finally met and liked Taeyang and he sent her away in a jealous fit. At which of those points should she have given up? And even with how these events played out, they took it out on her and made her self confidence drop. That explains why she would try to approach that HG who also doesn\u2019t have good intentions. If she was seeing clearly she would run.\n\n\nThe reason why Taeyang is unliked is because of that immaturity. It\u2019s too much for someone his age and it\u2019s a turn-off. Someone who\u2019s 36 years old thinks that public display of jealousy should show the girl that his feelings are strong. Or that the person he offended should be the one to make a move to amend issues with him. Or the fact that he jumped into conclusions about how Daon felt about him without checking with her at all. He\u2019s very overly emotional, he listens selectively and gets upset without waiting for full context, and he\u2019s too possessive. The conversation with he and Bareum and hangyeol showed that. And like you said he knows his flaws but he\u2019s unwilling to change. That\u2019s why he\u2019s not liked. And compared to people like Bareum and Chansol, he really can\u2019t match up. Hangyeol is someone people are mostly on the fence about, I personally get negative vibes from him. I feel like he\u2019s hiding a messed up personality underneath that quiet exterior. A scene in this episode that confirmed that for me was when Bareum asked him if it was Daon\u2019s fault that he misunderstood her and he said yes without hesitation. Never mind that this girl had not made any moves at him up until that time.",

I agree that not one of them deserve to give her any grief over her actions. My issue with Daon is like I explained, she misleads people and then doesn\u2019t clear it up and then in a way doesn\u2019t seem to learn from it. Just from the show, I wouldn\u2019t trust Daon\u2019s intentions but it\u2019s an edited reality so I don\u2019t necessarily know that it reflects her reality. Don\u2019t come at me for my thoughts on Daon - I don\u2019t like her but I don\u2019t think she deserves these assholes either.\n\nRegarding Taeyang - okay I see, thanks for explaining. So the main issue it seems is immaturity. Which is fair. I admit I never saw immaturity as anything other than a \u201cno thanks\u201d but not a reason to dislike someone, but I think to your point it looks bad to reach such an age and still be this behind maturity wise. Also, the more I think about it, I guess he will never change or grow unless he realises that. \n\nPS: no one would ever measure up to Bareum so there\u2019s no point in comparing \ud83e\udd23\n\nAnd totally totally agree on Hangyeol, I get such terrible vibes from him. That calm demeanour downright terrifies me. I also was super turned off at that scene where Daon is like distraught and he\u2019s like \u201cyes, it\u2019s her fault\u201d\n\nI genuinely feel at this point like I am just rooting for certain people to NOT get hurt (like Hanui, Bareum) rather than for couples\u2026",

            "comment": "1/ Justice for Daon. She is a victim here and paying the fact that some fragile men can't handle rejection, understand the principle of a dating show / accept that she was not fully into them from day 1. How crazy is that:\n\n* Hanu being shady as hell, flirting with all women, attacking Daon over his bruised ego and disrespecting Haneul several times ;\n* TaeYang a manchild not being able to express correctly his emotions and using Haneul as a plan B/rivalry prize with Hanu;\n* HangYeol acting in the shadows, drawing stuff in secret and not even responding to our king Bareum when he ask whether he is a rival...\n\nand Daon would be the fox here? haha NOPE. The part where Hanu criticized her for sending him a text whereas he litterally did the same thing x10 worse to Haneul and Daon was a damn joke.\n\nTo me Pink Lie is an interesting illustration of how a group of vexed men can paint a woman as being a shady fox and collectively hurt her self-respect by making her doubt about herself, even if she only did 10% of what they all did (because I am not saying Daon is perfect).\n\nI hope that watching the show now, she realizes how unfair they were to her.\n\n2/ Bareum be blessed, you are the real one. So happy he supported her. Clearly the best man of the show, with Chansol. Too bad that sneaky Seulbi is playing him but honestly, he will be dodging a bullet when she rejects him.\n\n3/ I love how Haneul is slowing proving she may not be weak actually... so entertaining. Is her secret so bad that it is not displayed yet?\n\n4/ By the way, the only reason Hanu and TaeYang are laughing and playing fair about their rivalry for Haneul is probably just because they are not really into her - especially in light of their respective \"fire\" personalities. She was both of them's plan B, they just want to be chosen by a girl at the end. The reason they were terrible when fighting for Daon is probably because they were more passionate about her. Haneul deserves better.\n\n5/ Feeling really bad for Hanui. The show producers are guilty here: they should have filtered the contestants, it is way too unfair that she has such a bad secret compared to the others.",

            "comment": "(1) Hangyeol &amp; Daon's Hidden Room talk seems like DO's last resort of getting picked. She knows it ended for Hanu &amp; Taeyang, he is the only one left. She liked him in the first meeting but was attracted to the 2 fires and got lost. I think Hangyeol is getting swayed by Daon but not very much since I think he said that he is attracted to TWO people- one is his usual ideal type (Seulbi) but not so heartfluttering, and the other one (Daon) but has the trait he dislikes the most. I don't think he had really opened up to Daon in that evening though, but just Daon 'appealing' to him so that she have at least 1 person that who'll choose her.\n\n* But I am still glad they had a talk. The good thing about this dating show *besides the fact it's regularly released &amp; subbed in Disney+* is that almost every **potential** pairing is explored. Hangyeol &amp; Daon actually reminds me of &gt;!Brad &amp; Summer!&lt; from *Secret Man and Woman,* in a way that they are interested with each other in first impressions but as the episode progresses, they have missed their timing. I am not specifically rooting this couple but that way is kinda better too.\n\n(2) I am so happy the Hanu x Daon x Taeyang is over. *(Thank God, they spared the last episode for such drama.)* Hanu x Haneul x Taeyang is much more fun. JK, this could only be because it is ending and TY is not so into with dating game anymore.\n\n(3) Seulbi might get her heart broken because Hangyeol seem to have given the new painting to somehow part with her with some good memories (*a la Hanu)*. I think he will choose Daon. The most heartbroken will be Bareum though. ugh.\n\n(4) I am excited to know everyone's secret but kinda anxious for Hanui too. I am most curious about Haneul's secret and final decision especially with the foreshadowing during the French Fries game",

That indicates there are no true feelings for Haneul. Daon cried and I started to cry as well cause she was really wrongfullly treated and Bareum was very mature and correct about it. I agree with the hosts, he is the most mature for marriage out of the men. \nI wonder what Knetz say about Daon. I feel that she may never get an appology from Taeyung, Hanu and Hangeul about how they accused her. They spinned things out of the blue instead of talking with her and understand her better. She is scared and exhausted- I think it's absolutly normal reaction. Chaneyol and Dahae are cute and normal. Hanui is sad and nervous about the pink lie reveal, I truly wish her the best and that noone treats her poorly, considering the chauvinism in display, I think they might behave badly without us knowing directly. \nThe production crew shouldn't have hidden the sms from them. I think the crew created more tension than needed in am allready pressured mileu. This episode was better edited and had intresting content. From Hanu and his hilarious way of \"ending\" things with Daon, to Bareum giving the best advice. \n\nBig respect for Bareum. He was this show MVP. I will definetly root for him after the show.",

            "comment": "First of all,\nBareum is the mvp of this episode for sure. He handles most things with a maturity that is admirable. When Seulbi and hangyeol did a love shot in front of him, he had every right to be upset but he knows from the conversation he had with Seulbi that she considered Hangyeol as well. Instead he took it all in good faith and still let her know that he liked her. \nHis conversation with Daon was my favorite and I cheered when he asked hangyeol if it was Daon\u2019s fault he misunderstood her. And how he said the guys are cowards then. Which is true. They were all so concerned about their egos, the forgot she was a human being with feelings and dilemmas too. And then they all hurt her in one way or the other, Hanu with his fox comment, Taeyang with his switch, Hangyeol by blaming her for her misfortunes. And they\u2019re all so childish for full grown men. I\u2019m glad he told her not to blame herself for what happened on the show and that she shouldn\u2019t have to shrink herself because of it. I just wished she hadn\u2019t taken Dahae\u2019s advice to try to win hangyeol back. Because it\u2019s almost as though she\u2019s going for the person who has been most consistent with her, forgetting how he also treated her once upon a time, and even when she doesn\u2019t like him like that.\n\n\nI might be the only one but I found every bit of that Hanu-Taeyang-Haneul triangle very cringe. It was very childish and very out of the blue. Did Taeyang not think it necessary to let her know that he had interest in her? Or was it best to be throwing comments over the table? Idk\nI personally cringed every single time. \n\nHanu honestly, I have no words. It just goes to show that he calls people for conversations and doesn\u2019t listen to a word they say. Daon explained the text she sent and exactly how she felt about him, and how she wished him well going forward. It was a very clear goodbye. It was only Hanu that didn\u2019t think it was and he thought giving her back the LP was supposed to be a clean break, like bro, nothing was left of that relationship. \n\nLastly Seulbi, I don\u2019t know how to feel because she\u2019s doing everything right in front of Bareum\u2019s face. At the same time, I don\u2019t want to judge her harshly just because I feel bad for him. But I think picking someone on a date just so he doesn\u2019t feel bad is a bit off. Especially since she said it so easily to hangyeol. She definitely has a right to choose someone else and at least she had a conversation with Bareum about it the previous night, so no hard feelings.\nI just can\u2019t help but feel as though, if it were Daon, the hate on her would have been a lot. The hate is already a lot and she hasn\u2019t even done this much. And there\u2019s selective criticism from the viewers of the show. A lot of which I feel is based off of projections. \n\nI think someone mentioned already but now that the end is near, the housemates definitely must feel rushed and it shows in their actions \n\nChansol and Dahae were barely shown this episode, and it hurts because they clearly edited a lot of their scenes out. Disney plus better give us unreleased footage. I think they\u2019ll be fine eventually and like Chansol said, they\u2019d  either be good friends or be lovers, and that\u2019s fine too. They both clearly care very much about each other and I wish them the best.\n\nIf I were to rank them according to my preference\n\nDahae=Chansol=Bareum&gt;Daon&gt;&gt;&gt;Haneul&gt;&gt;&gt;Hanui=Seulbi&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hangyeol&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Taeyang=Hanu \n\ud83d\ude11",

He seems more mature than Hanu and Taeyang and even Hangyeol.\n\nAnd nope, you are not the only one who found it childish... that love triangle especially given Hanu and Taeyang... Haneul deserves much better.\n\nUntil the end, Hanu is his usual self with Daon. A man and in his age, should not be acting like he has acted all along. \n\nMy opinion on Seulbi is based off her treatment of Bareum... and because of that, I am cheering for him the most among the guys to find his happy ending outside the show. He deserves a queen in his life.\n\nAs for Daon, still the same as last time. Projections galore is what I see from some people. The best thing she would have gotten from this show is definitely a lot of lessons. I hope she finds a King outside the show, someone way better than the three guys she was linked to in the show.\n\nDahae and Chansol's journey in the show is too smooth sailing, the pds didn't show much throughout because honestly there was no drama to show. I wish them the best outside the show. They seem really perfect for each other... though their age might be a problem. But who knows, they might marry early?\n\nRank or preference... the same bottom 4: Seulbi, Hangyeol, Hanu=Taeyang. Bareum is my #1 as of this episode.",

It\u2019s heartbreaking that he has to bear all of his family\u2019s burden alone and like you said I wish him all the happiness in the world, he deserves it. For someone who seems to have had a hard time in life, he still has his principles and kindness intact. If there\u2019s anything he has learnt from this show, it\u2019s how to be more direct about his feelings. He\u2019ll need it in the outside world. I cheered so loud when he comforted Daon, and when she cried I teared up a little. I don\u2019t know what it is about that girl that tugs at my heartstrings so. I know that it is all she has been through on the show that makes her feel like Hangyeol has respected and supported her the most and as such she shoujd go to him. I hope she realizes she can meet even better people outside. She deserves the love. I understand the lack of drama is the reason for ChanHae scarcity but the pds can at least give them to us in between all the drama as a landing pad of some sorts.\nFingers crossed  for a montage of their moments when they pick each other. \n\nThe show ends next week and I\u2019m happy I found people who echoed a lot of my thoughts about it. \u2764\ufe0f",

SEULBI was just accepting Barreum offer, but she just show affection toward Hangyeol. HANGYEOL..  I think he has POTENTIAL to be one as I don't have enough information.   \n\n\n\\*NOTE: This is what based on the nature of the show, like Haneul said. We could'nt be mad at it. We SHOULD NOT assume what their overall personality based on the show, BUT I do think if you debating on this forum, it should be based on what's given",

But they were both initially interested in each other.\n\nHanu saying haneul's eyes remind him of a cow \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 is that how farmers tell someone they are pretty? \n\nDH gives such good advice honestly.

He's the only one telling DO it's not her fault \ud83e\udd7a - and sticking up for her in front of HG who is older. \n\nIs HG just waiting to see who would be more open to him?

Not sure how I feel abt this \n\nStraightforward BR is so cool but i have a feeling he's gonna get his heart broken \n\nHanui asking Hanu if he was ever attracted to her... gurl... why? You're setting yourself up for public humiliation. Also who cares??? He has already made it clear he's not choosing you. She needs to let it go. \n\nHaneul is my hero!!!!!! Saying she wouldn't pick Hanu in front of everyone was *chef's kiss*. Will she also go holla at HG??? She ranked TY below HG and Hanu so... i feel like it's not gonna be TY? \n\nYou're telling me CS is touching DH's toes and they haven't at least made out??? \n\nDamnnnnnn i guess HG is choosing SB over DO? \n\nHanui's reaction at the end was so heartbreaking... i mean she knew it would be happening at some point but I feel even worse knowing her secret is so intense compared to everyone else's. \n\nAre there gonna be any other couples besides CS and DH? I guess SB and whomever she chooses.",

            "comment": "Bareum is the best of them all. He doesn\u2019t act vindictive like taeyang or Hanu when the girl he likes flirts with others. Like he told Daon you have to keep your self respect. It\u2019s a sign of maturity that he isn\u2019t possessive over seulbi. He\u2019s always been the big bro of the house.\n\nI\u2019m surprised with haneul I thought she and Hanu were hitting it off. Maybe she\u2019s just giving him a taste of his own medicine. Hanu acts like such a egotistical loser in front of Daon perhaps she clocked the red flags and decided to reject him publicly. I hope she means it and it\u2019s not just her being confusing on purpose. They have a cute like high school romance going on but if I were Haneul I\u2019d just keep wondering if Hanu is settling for his 2nd choice like she kept bringing it up.\n\nWhy did hanui embarrass herself again by asking Hanu if she was attracted. She didn\u2019t like the fact that he gave her flowers on her bday because it was leading her on. Hanu could\u2019ve been nice but he told the truth seeing how she told him to that giving flowers was being fox like. \n\nSpeaking of Hanu there was no reason to return the vinyl like him that he\u2019s so petty and annoying. He just wants to twist the knife at this point. \n\nI don\u2019t like hangyeol idk why his energy is so sneaky. It\u2019s unattractive like men using poison to kill ppl instead of fighting like a man. Idk if it makes sense but idk how else to describe my ick w him lol. Also when he cried it was so out of place like huh. I get it but what\u2019s w him is he emotionally repressed or sumn. Like idk he has weird vibes.\n\nDahae and Chansol being awkward w each other in the bath was so cute. Chansol is so dependable too. He always tries his best to impress dahae. I wonder if dahae wasn\u2019t a chaebol if it would be the same tho\u2026 I have a feeling when women are higher status the men try harder.\n\nI\u2019m ready for this show to end. I\u2019m annoyed it\u2019s weekly. It should be 2x a week ugh",

Bareum then looked at him and said but your lie has already been revealed.\n\nAnd this part that came next, suddenly an alarm went off in my head..  \n\n\nHangyeol then replied, \"\ub354 \uc788\uc744 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uc9c0\\~\" \"There could possibly be more..\"  \n\n\nNow why would Hangyeol say something like that? \n\nPlease don't tell me there is gonna be another twist to the their lies.. Is there more than what has already been revealed so far?? What if indeed this crazy theory is true?   \n\n\nMaybe that's why there was a scene with Hanu crying which hasn't yet been revealed..\n\nIt's just pure speculation on my part but really, if what is revealed in the next and final episode is indeed the whole complete truth... then man we are in for one helluva rollercoaster ride..",

I do think that leaded her to give a chance to taeyang and vote him first  \n\n\\- she ended up going with hanu just caus he didnt get picked by his first choice daon which she wasnt that happy about.  She didnt spoke a lot during the car ride but i feel like shes just a rlly nice person and eventually she tried to be more receptive just not to create a bad mood caus she was gonna spend the day with hanu despite everything so might as well make it enjoyeable. U also have to give props to hanu who was actually trying for once. But still that doesnt change the fact that he  wasnt haneul first choice and he hurt her previously (which she kept reming him of during the trip). She did it as a joke but i do feel like its just caus shes didnt feel like fighting over it and just enjoyed the view of hanu trying his best to redeem himself\n\n\\- when she got back she learned tayeang voted her first too so ofc it would mean something to her so even do i think she does like hanu taeyang is also someone she really considers as an option for her last choice\n\n\\-she seems like the type to forgive but not forget and taeyand only showed good sides compared to hanu (who she gived multiple chances) so its is a factor to consider\n\ni do think there's a high chance of her choosing hanu but i do feel like shes honestly still hesitating with taeyang and asserting clearly this hesitation as a small vengence toward hanu\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNEXT DAON\n\ni love her but i feel like she never rlly got over hanu. I feel like shes the type to question a lot of her behaviors and that need to put words on her feelings and understand them to move on. her relation with hanu was misundestandings after misunderstandings which led her to constantly change trajectory then come back to him and never knowing what to expect. In her date with tae she kept mentionning him caus i think she needed things to be solved or else she wouldnt stop thinking about it wondering what she shouldv done. She also constantly compared the guys everytime shed confess. She told at first hanu was special caus the of their connexion in music taste, then she told taeyanf he was special caus he was the only one that made her feel butterfly than she told hangyeols he was special caus she was the most herself with him. So at the end she liked some things about each the guys and was only decided on them once she was rejected by her first choice (hanu reject him so tae is special , tae reject her so hangyeol is special...) I dont think shes a bad person but i feel like she was trying to much to please everyone without focusing on finding who she really liked so she never got to enjoy the expercience.\n\nalso i feel like hanu is the typa guy whos overly motivated by values of justice that he strugglt to apply. like he only considered daon or haneul emotions when it was linked to him but he gets rlly mad and vengeful when ppl hurt HIS emotions so idk i think he still has some growing to do and i prefere tae for haneul even do i think he not a bad person per say",

Like maybe he felt ignored or like knew Hanui would choose Hanu over him. But I get it, I don't like lies either. Yet he did join a show called Pink Lie though, so idk, lol.\n\nBut ya, hopefully they understand each other after the reveal of the lies. Because outside of Dahae and Chansol, Bareum and Hanui are possibly the second likeliest couple, maybe. Or it could be Haneul and Hanu, depends on Haneul's final choice.",

Haneul settled for Hanu after being indirectly rejected by Taeyang. Seulbi obviously has no interest for bareum but is stringing him along as backup if she doesnt get chosen by Hangyeol. Taeyang settled for Haneul. \n\nThe point I\u2019m getting here is that everyone has a Plan B and plan C. It\u2019s a dating show. Anyone from that show who chooses to criticize Daon are hypocrites!",

For now I think her answers have a higher chance of being true than false atm.. Regardless of what happened in the past I was rooting for them in the end. I do think if she had no plans for Hanu, she should of made it clear when she realized he was all in for her.  You could say it was getting back at him for all hes done, but saying no once he essentially confessed should of been enough.\n\nDespite her being shocked at Taeyangs secret, perhaps her secret is of similar nature (seems to be big).  Is she a dominatrix? It doesn't seem likely though that they would have 3 of the secrets be of sexual nature.",

Whatever the outcome, i hope they can find happiness post-show.\n\nSuddenly I am thinking there is a possibility that Haneul in ep 11 was considering HG because she picked him as #1 for the trip and always gave positive comments about him. It is not because she wants to be a couple with HG, but more because she does not like how Hanu treated her &amp; Daon, how Taeyang treated Daon and has no other options as she never considered Bareum. Unfortunately it was never shown how she thinks about Bareum. It will depend on the dynamics on the last day who she will pick as the final choice.\n\nPreviously I was cheering for Daon, but I did not like how she changed to HG the day after Taeyang rejected her and right after the convo with Hanu. Feels sad for how she was being treated by Hanu and Taeyang. But i think it is better for her to focus on herself at the moment instead of trying to couple up with anyone.",

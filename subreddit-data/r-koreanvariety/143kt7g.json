Season 3 was actually announced last year with a confirmation of it early this year (part of TVING's 2023 Line-Up).  It's sad that the creator (Lee-Jin Joo PD) has left CJ ENM. My hopes (quality) for season 3 just went down. She is the brainchild of the show. I just don't expect it to be on par with the production of S2. Plus, Pink Lie PD? I honestly didn't enjoy that show's production. It went downhill after few episodes imo. I hope to see that my expectations of Season 3 will be wrong when it streams later this year(?).",

The concept was interesting but the flow and imbalance were just not it. I wonder if the new team will be able to get me hooked enough to endure 2-3 hours per episode like TL2.",

                    "comment": "To add, from what I remember, when Jin-Joo (the creator/PD) of the show was interviewed last year about the possibility of Season 3. She said that she would take a break first. The gap between S1 and S2 didn\u2019t leave her any break to rest last year, saying that most of the staff of S1 and S2 are the same (basically saying that she was tired). With shows like Transit Love, the planning and production of it are massive. CJ ENM uploaded a [video](https://youtu.be/YvmqVMSGadk) of it last year, showing us the behind-the-scenes of producing the show. CJ ENM really lost a gem on this one. If you have seen her produced shows. They are pretty successful on their own.",

To be fair though, the cast of S2 probably made the PD's job like 10x easier with the amount of content generated. If the new PD keeps the foundation in place and they get a decent cast it could still be entertaining to watch. I don't think anything will top season 2 though, it was just magical on all fronts especially the later episodes.",

Love Transit, lmao, and it'll be **available on Amazon Prime Video Japan this June 15, so like 1 more week**. And it'll have fewer episodes, so wonder how the runtime or episode length will be as that's key for the emotional investment with the show.\n\n**Trailer for EXchange/Transit Love (Japanese/\uc77c\ubcf8 Version), called Love Transit (\u30e9\u30d6 \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8), from the Prime Video JP - \u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa channel**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGyWTew58-U\n\nLove Transit might have English subs or not. I might sub it for you guys but it's highly unlikely as I have timing/writing/etc. problems (always have proper posture when playing video games (especially the ones that require the mouse a lot) or writing walls of text (lol), carpal tunnel/arthritis/etc. is no joke) and so there'll need to be somebody else to do the syncing with the dialogue and scenes, and that can get boring really quickly and so ya, it's unfortunate.\n\nDon't worry though, there might be a big bounty/request for it and so some of us will get a good version even if it doesn't have English subtitles and then some other dating show fans can do their own fansubs if it's not picked up by say Viki/VIU/etc.",

                    "comment": "I disagree. I think deception ruins dating shows. I say this under the presumption that the purpose of a dating show is to show real human connection and see relationships develop.\n\nIts so difficult for people to build real connections and relationships with people when they know that they could be getting tricked, in these scenarios the cast build walls around their heart to prevent heartbreak incase they were being tricked. This is why the show Love Catcher sucks as a dating show. If you like Love Catcher that is fine but thats because its more of a game show than a dating show. Its more similar to something like Sixth Sense. Even in Sixth Sense they have lots of dating show elements that mostly revolve around MiJoo and the guests, but I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t call Sixth Sense a dating show. \n\nI think Transit Love deception is about as far as I would allow for a dating show. Technically everyone is pretending to not know their exe, so there is some degree of deception but this deception doesn\u2019t prevent them from opening up to the other housemembers. In a way they are almost encouraged to be more receptive of other housemembers in order to not make their exe obvious.",

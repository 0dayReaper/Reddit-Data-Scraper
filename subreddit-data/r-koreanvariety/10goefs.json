    "postText": "Hi hi :)\n\nI only used to watch the show whenever EXO guested, but recently I find myself binge watching episodes whenever an SMent idol\\* was a guest so I've watched most of that and I already plan to watch the rest.\n\nI'm interested to know any episodes you've found remarkable or funny, or whenever a guest had a good chemistry with the cast. I don't have a specific preference as to guests, or whether they solved the song. Thanks!\n\n*\\*Just to clarify, watched SMent idol as* ***guest***, I haven't watched every episode that had Taeyeon and/or Key in it just because they're part of the cast.",

Sunny and Lee Sun Bin also have appeared multiple times and were very crucial in the dictation games. You can also try episodes with actor Park Sung Woong, he loooooves the snack game hahaha and of course any episode with Hyoyeon is entertaining because she's just too clueless about everything",

That SVT song really got them good and set a great tone for their future guestings.

I wasn't the biggest fan of PO when I started watching AS but now I miss him because he gives off such pure-but-chaotic maknae energy whenever he teases the cast, esp Hanhae and Donghyun!",

I'm a few weeks behind right now but it is a lot of fun to watch the new episodes since they invite guests that have new dramas or comebacks which keeps me up to date a bit and find new dramas, movies and music. \ud83d\ude0a",

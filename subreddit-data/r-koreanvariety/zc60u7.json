The main game consists of listening to a song and determining the correct lyrics for a part of it while employing different hints to get closer to the solution. Every failed attempt means more food for YouTube mukbang star Small-mouthed Haetnim. During Snack Time a different game each week determines who gets to try a snack representing this week's market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Host**\n\n* Boom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Shin Dong-yeop\n* Kim Dong-hyun\n* Moon Se-yoon\n* Park Narae\n* Hanhae\n* Key\n* Nucksal\n* Taeyeon\n* Haetnim\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Guests**\n\n* Kim Won Hun\n* Jo Jin Se\n* Um Ji Yoon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**One Shots**\n\n|Member|2022|Overall|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Key|32|94|\n|Seyoon|12 + 1|73|\n|P.O\\*|8|56|\n|Hanhae|15 + 1|53|\n|Hyeri\\*|0|49|\n|Nucksal|10|44|\n|Narae|3|38|\n|Taeyeon|7|20|\n|Shin Dongyeob|2|15|\n|Donghyun|1|15|\n|Haetnim|1|1|\n\n\\*\\*updated based on Wiki\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Subtitles**\n\n|**Stream**|Link|\n|:-|:-|\n|Streaming site|[Viu](https://www.viu.com/ott/ph/en-us/vod/465107/Amazing-Saturday-2022)|\n\n**Source**\n\n\\*Viu\n\n^(\\*you can still support @/dareumi from all the subtitle works they had done for the community by donating through -)  [^(ko-fi.com/dareumi)](https://ko-fi.com/dareumi) ^(+)",

Between these 3 and the guy that was on with Chanhyuk a few weeks ago, I am honestly confused if people like them and consider them funny, or if they just have some awesome editing team that clips together bits to make them seem funny on whatever show(s) they're normally on. I completely understand when people do impressions or references I don't get that they might be funny, but I genuinely don't understand what's been going on with recent guests that are supposed to be \"funny\" but are just awkward and lame.",

                    "comment": "I think it was indirectly implied by the cast and the staff captions that being funny on a youtube channel and/or comedy shows which have pre-planned skits is a lot different compared to being funny \"live\" on a variety show, where most interactions aren't really prepared in advance. A stand-up comedian (most of whom have to know how to engage with the audience and exchange banter) is a lot more suited to variety than your classic Korean \"gagman\".\n\nOut of the guests today, Ji Yoon wasn't trying to be funny (even though she had that Yoollerina persona that Key loves to fall back on if she wanted), Jin Se is all about his chin and resembleness to Saturday Gem which is funny but gets old really quickly and Won Hun crashed and burned due to being too artificial and over-prepared.\n\nSure, you can choose to play a character or have some likely comments prepared in advance, but picking the right character, the right timing and the right tone is difficult.\nAdditiobaly, which of the above is the correct choice often depends on the audience and can vary.",

Nucksal/Narae/Key are great with words and then there's Donghyun and Sewoon with more physical gags (DH repeatedly pushing Wonhun to sit down or escorting him away became a funny gag at the end). So while I might not always like the comedian guests' type of humor, I can always rely on the cast to make it entertaining",

I like how they openly admit how Wonhun comedy bits failed miserably, but also didnt criticise him too much and actually tried to help/give tips to save his failed gags. \n\nIt was really on him to keep on failing at it despite the chances they gave lol. Loved how key just cooly ignored his attempts to give advice about dancing during the snack game. Like bruh u really be barking up the wrong tree.",

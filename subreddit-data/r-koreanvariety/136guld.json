            "comment": "I really love seeing the glimpses into Haha and Byul's relationship as both parents and husband/wife; they do such a great job at supporting the other and being observant of their needs. Haha taking Song out for ice cream to distract her (our mukbang princess!) while Byul gets to surf to her content. Similarly, when Byul sees how Haha is enjoying the BBQ party, she makes the offer to be the driver so her husband can drink and have fun. Props to the uncles on doing everything they can to cheer Song up lol",

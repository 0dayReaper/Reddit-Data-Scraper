            "comment": "i know HDYP is on MBC and the recent YJS's daesang is from SBS but today's ep really shows why YJS is worthy of that daesang. He owns the most screen time, because he actually put the efforts and tried to solve it. Junha and Haha did very well this episode too. They were funny, and are actually trying hard. I feel like the younger members worn out way too easily and wasn't as eager as YJS and Haha so they just stop trying/interacting and it gets kinda boring to watch. \n\nThe other members should really be interacting with the citizens more / the drivers to get funny reactions just like Haha and YJS. Junha was funny on the last few minutes, but that was memorable enough. I really hope Jinjoo would step up her game because though I like her acting, she doesn't really fit in a variety show and I'm still wondering what is her 'character' because Yi Kyung already chose one as the 'body guy' and the 'lover guy' with Mijoo. \n\nanyways, today's is definitely the best episode after a long time.",

Fun to use street view and google map and finally find the location. Loved seeing the members doing this but without the online options. Sadly some of the members where not that great at it. Liked how it ended and continuous next week with everyone spread out.",

It felt so forced. I dont like the direction that hdyp is going. I dont need to see another show like running man, esp not with yjs playing the same role. How redundant. I bet even the cast is disappointed at the direction this show is going. The role plays as office workers were funner than this. I am actually shocked that they stretched this bs for more than 1 episode.",

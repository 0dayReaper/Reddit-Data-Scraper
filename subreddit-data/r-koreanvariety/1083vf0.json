    "postText": "\n[article](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2023/01/na-pds-new-restaurant-variety-seojins-reportedly-airing-next-month)\n\nThere's the reliable chefs Jung Yoo Mi and Park Seo Joon, the errand boy Choi Woo Sik, plus a new addition to the team, BTS's V. It's believed that the BTS member's addition to the program is the result of a special ticket that V earned during the variety program 'The Game Caterers', aired in May of 2021.\n\nFilming ended some time at the end of 2022 in Mexico. The program is expected to begin airing in early February during a Friday evening time slot.",

Ever since I started watching Let's Play Soccer 2, I find myself only watching these sports variety shows. \ud83e\udd2d\n\nAs for Monster's new manager, I'm loving every single moment of it. \ud83d\ude02 I really can't wait to watch it with subs (please Netflix release more episodes fast \ud83d\ude11). It's so hilarious how he's so serious and the players wanted to celebrate but they're so wary of him. \ud83d\ude02 And I think Jung Keunwoo spent more time with him or something? Definitely looking forward to the next episode. \ud83d\ude2d\n\n&gt;!Their recent win is so crazy! It's so cute how the manager gave 1 of the dolls to Chanhee.!&lt;",

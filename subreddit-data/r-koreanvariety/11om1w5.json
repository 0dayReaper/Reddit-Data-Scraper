If YJS really didn't want the song to become public he could have easily said no and they just would not show the clip at the caf\u00e9 where the PD pitched the idea to YJS.

My man clearly stand at top of jungle and now is in his 50s.\n\nAlthough the approach might wrong, as they want to do classic \"suddenly comes and attack to surprise like what real variety should\". But let's be real tho, whether YJS forced or not, the fact that it's airing means they have comes to agreement, either YJS just gladly do it after thinking, or the PD forced him, or the PD just beg him to save him in hoping to raise the rating with music and dance project.\n\nI mean, well, dance project is one thing. But the song is YJS privately own object(?) legally. So even if the PD forced YJS to do it, what actually the PD can do if YJS reject the idea? Making the same song? It's lost the meaning of the project and bound to legal problem. It's not like the PD can threatened YJS to kick him from the show from reject to use his own material.",

In saying so, YJS will always commit and do anything he can to support the shows he's in (e.g. Infinite Challenge). Just shows what a great man he is.",

No way he would have allowed song and dance to be used for the show or mentioned at all without his consent. He\u2019s not the PD but has a lot of pull. The only thing wrong with PD is he\u2019s not very good. This project is YJS directly intervening to try to turn the show around.",

I am slowly catching up.\n\nIs it because of the new cast members or PD?\n\nI'll still watch HDYP and make the weekly posts, but just wondering what are thoughts since I remember reading comments saying the show is getting bad, but the new music segment is great.\n\nSide note: I haven't watched the last few months or so of Running Man as well, so I need to catch up.",

All YJS's buddies had to show up to help save the show. But honestly, it don't really do it for me. I feel like singing and dancing project is great when the show is on the upturn, not a last ditch effort to save the show. Knowing how desperate they are with saving the show, they almost cut out Jun Ha and Bong Shins role completely - although no one misses Jun Ha anyway. But Bong Shin's role is undeserving. \n\nTL:DR - Forming and dance and singing group when the cast members do not have good chemistry yet makes a really boring show. I don't mean good chemistry in real life but chemistry on screen, I am not the only one that feels that way right?",

I was hoping like the next project would be like reuniting Lovelyz with Jinjoo and making them one last song to redebut. He probably won\u2019t be able to use the exact name Lovelyz due to copyright purposes, but you know what I mean.\n\nHaha and the other cast members were fun but would like a change of fresh air.\n\nLike add Jeon So Min and Song Ji Hyo as their manager or something",

I mainly watch for YJS &amp; Mi Joo banter ngl. I was thinking back to some more fun and memorable episodes. The rugby episode came to mind...it was fun and informative for the public, as it's sadly still a pretty unpopular sport in Korea. I'd be down to watch them visit different sports teams, or learn different skills, or highlight uncommon jobs or industries.\n\nAlso, interactions with the public can be heartwarming. I did like the episodes when they were helping the public (Mi Joo teaching a BTS dance for a proposal was super cute). \n\nRight now, it feels like there isn't a clear direction that the PD &amp; writing team wanna go. I'm all for experimentation but they're not trying anything fresh or new. Even if they do another music project that could be fun, but why not switch up the genre or have the members be part of the songwriting process?",

Such a far departure from the pilot episodes when YJS asked for a fresh variety show versus the typical recipe of a cookie cutter variety show with known variety cast members.\n\nI still don\u2019t understand why this PD always has to have screen time every episode. \n\nI still watch the show but it\u2019s not much different than Running Man now.",

I think 1N2D does a pretty good job of initiating variety rookies with extreme camping. It builds rapport between the cast and marks the pd as the \"bad guy\" that has authority over them. I think the episode where they told the cast recording was cancelled and then picked up for a mission may have been a sad attempt at that. \n\nThey really need to reorganize the production team and atleast try older concepts that proved successful from any other show.",

For me it's just like seeing Dong Wan FD from old RM, or Mud Man in recent 2D1N. I dont think he wants to keep hogging air time tho, since he didnt appear much in last 2-3 episodes.",

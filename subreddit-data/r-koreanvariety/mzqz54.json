    "postText": "I've already posted this on RM's subreddit but I've also asked permission to post it here for some RM and Kwang soo fans.\n\nTo the man who gave his 101%:\n\nRM has been running for 11 years now and at one point I thought that they could run for another decade or so but with the news that was released today, reality is catching up to us, the runners, but especially to the members.\n\nI've tuned in to RM for a couple of years now. I watched my first episode during the period when I was preparing for the toughest exam of my life which was my licensure exam. I could safely say that RM got me through all the months of stress and sleepless nights. RM has been a comfort and stress reliever for me but I know the show means even more to some of us. \n\nIt's kind of a weird feeling you know; The RM members don't even know me but somehow I feel attached to them like as they were running all those years, I've been running with them and I'd bet a lot of us here feel the same way.\n\nNow, I would like to offer the highest form of appreciation to Lee Kwang soo. RM has given a lot to Kwang soo but Kwang soo has given everything for RM. Kwang soo doesn't even know the meaning of \"No\" in RM. \n\n*Wrestling match with Jihyo?\n\nKwang soo: I got this.\n\n*Eating food that's already been in So min's mouth?\n\nKwang soo: I got this.\n\n*Receives a mission to make a paper plane out of their take out containers but he only has banana and orange peels?\n\nKwang soo: I got this.\n\n*Gets in an accident and injures his foot that normally requires a month or two to recover?\n\nKwang soo: I got this (immediately returns in less than a month)\n\nWe've invaded his apartment, met his parents and we've watched him meet the love of his life. We've seen him in his underwear, his censored butt and many more embarrassing moments throughout his RM run. Yes, he's worn many bald caps, face paints, flour and icing on his face and he even dressed up as a tree, but still he gives 101% percent. Although he's never received one Daesang (Grand prize) for his 11 years of RM work, he has brought millions of laughter and smiles to runners around the globe.\n\nHe may be considered as RM's prince of betrayal but everybody knows that Kwang soo's loyalty will always be with RM. Yes that's a bit cheesy but the truth is sometimes cheesy.\n\nFor over 500 episodes, Kwang soo was always running around and chasing the prize on screen but seeing him always giving his everything, his 101%, in RM and his acting career, I'm happy and confident in saying that this time, success and happiness will be the ones chasing after him now . With all that said, together we shout his forever iconic \"ANDWAAAAAAAAAE\"\n\nEDIT: Reading the comments made me think how huge Kwang soo has contributed to the world of variety entertainment and also, our lives as viewers. I hope he knows how much we appreciate everything he did. Yes, RM is just a show but somehow Kwang soo and RM made life a little bit better you know. Mondays are universally hated but somehow Runners look forward to it because there's gonna be a new subbed RM episode. I can't imagine how the staff and other members must be feeling after being with him for 11 years. We have friends we met in high school or college who we're attached to, how much more a person that's been with you through a decade so now I kind of understand why I and a lot us are emotional. It's nice and comforting to read through the messages and comments of support and unforgettable moments with Kwang soo. To the man who doesn't have \"quit\" and \"give up\" in his vocabulary and to him who is the absolute definition of dedication, we give our highest respect and greatest salute.",

            "comment": "I was thinking the exact same - he always protests but still does, truly giving his 101%. the effort he's put in to rm is almost unparalleled, and it's such an odd feeling to think that the members started out with him in his mid twenties, and now he's in his mid thirties. I know this applies to all the members, but him being the (forever) youngest makes it feel so much bigger. One of the things I'll miss the most is the dynamic between kwang soo and other members.\n\njae seok and kwang soo's friendship which extends past the show - but especially with the way he cuts him off, randomly puts him in headlocks because \"he looks so annoying\" but goes to jae seok for advice (love + decisions on the show) and that no matter how many times jae seok laughs at kwang soo for being unlucky, he's almost just as unlucky too.\n\nkwang soo and jong kook is one I'll definitely miss, mainly because all I think about is that one episode they did the \"try not to laugh challenge\" and spent 30 minutes pretending to cry and trying their best too hold it out together, only for kwang soo to collapse immediately upon seeing han kibum. that and the contrast between the two for the acapella challenge.\n\nthe jihyo and kwang soo one isn't a dynamic we see often, but I'll always think about that one camping episode where jihyo said she struggled at the start and thought about quitting, but kwang soo was the one who held on to her and encouraged her to stay, and that she was grateful to him for that.\n\nmost of all, him forever being running man's youngest - that episode, where somin and sechan painted their faces yellow to make the other members laugh, and somin, sits there like \"sechan, tell kwang soo to come back soon\". the thought of that being a forever thing makes me sad, but at the same time I know it was definitely not an easy choice for him, and I'm glad he was able to take a step back and put his health first.",

            "comment": "*I\u2019ll copy what I wrote in the other post and put it here. I adore Kwangsoo and I would love to write more, but I might just cry my eyes out...*\n\nI was thinking more about Kwangsoo's contributions and it's quite huge. He's often the PD's \"ace card\" where he can be put into any group for screen time. Put him with Jaesuk for the most potent effect (I still want them to win best couple but it seems impossible now). Him and Jaesuk have a special bond where Jaesuk can use him for any gag because Kwangsoo is always on the same page (remember when they both stole Sukjin's van in tandem?). He's often chosen by guests because they like him and/or they think he's hilarious, not to mention that he's good friends with many top celebrities which shows his character. And also, he puts in 200% effort every episode. Remember how he immediately made himself look ugly in the \"biggest eyes\" contest? Most people wouldn't dare. \n\nI often say Kwangsoo is a perfect success story. He started out as a mostly nobody with the worst position in a comedy show, the idiot that gets made fun of. But he took his job seriously and was the *BEST* idiot that gets made fun of. He was creative, crafty, endearing, and crazy. He had the top man Jaesuk by his side so he had the best support there was, and they even became bestfriends. It shows how lovable he is as the cast and guests would often praise him even though his fake persona is that of a betrayer. Then he becomes super popular with the \"Asia Prince\" title from his fans. Then later on it's revealed he's dating Lee Sunbin, one of the most talented and gorgeous women in Korea. Them dating was nearly universally praised as both of them are well-liked. He worked his way from the bottom to the top with hard work and effort, and I'm proud of how successful he is now. He is a gem that is absolutely irreplaceable. \n\nI wish him the best going forward. I think he's an incredible person inside and out and I respect his decision, as well as hoping for a good recovery. But I think it's totally okay to be sad and upset at the news, it's natural. It shows how much we love him. Let's just hope he continues on to the path he wants in the future, wherever it leads him. Thank you for everything Lee Kwangsoo!",

Although this might be a tough news for RM, I think his actual acting career and skills has been overshadowed by \"comedic and bullied image\" YJS and RM imposed on him. I think it's a good time for a change for him and hope he can find good opportunities after his recovery. Thank you for 11 years of hard work and many episodes where only he can pull off (such as Sauna ep from Members Week).",

I never thought I would get this emotional when the core RM cast inevitably had to change, but then again never expected it to be Kwang-soo who would be leaving the show first.\n\nKwang-soo has been a huge part of the heart of RM that's kept me watching every week even through the show's ups and downs &amp; part of what defined the RM cast as a \"family\" after all these years. He was the wild card, always raising the bar, upping his game, and pushing everyone else to be funnier and do better-- he has such great chemistry with basically every member and every guest, and the sheer number of in-jokes and long-running gags that revolve around Kwang-soo is impressive. I doubt he will make a return to variety anytime soon, and despite him being an actor first and foremost-- wow, what a loss to comedy and variety this is.",

Some of the funniest physical interactions on the show have come from him being teamed up with an unsuspecting guest. It gives a good balance when you have KJK on the other side of the spectrum, at least when it comes to female guests, and the rest of the cast being somewhat reserved/friendly with guests.\n\nHowever, I feel like he's been pushed into the clown position in recent episodes, where noone is taking him seriously anymore. I miss his scheming and forming &amp; breaking of alliances, and it's frustrating seeing him getting cut-off from any conversation by YJS with that on-going joke.\nIt reminds me a bit of the episodes before Gary finally left, where he kept on being stuck into the same routines &amp; jokes all at his expense. I'm most likely reading too much into it, but it's the same feeling as when Gary left, where you could understand their decision at least a bit from the small glimpse you got when watching the show.",

Like with some other shows they'll be able to post updates or content when the last episode airs. For a while that's when you also get some post-show vlogs/videos, gatherings, etc. from them.\n\nHeart Signal 4 Instagram accounts: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/13q991t/heart_signal_4_episode_2_230524/jllqkk8/",

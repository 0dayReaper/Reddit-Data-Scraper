Everyone had great screen time. \n\nI thought the girls would be shy but they\u2019re comfortable (as they said they felt touched they\u2019re considered family). I can\u2019t wait to see them again in a summer show as Jaesuk had suggested. \n\nI love Jinjoo\u2019s punk character. She\u2019s so funny and poor Ji So cannot handle Jinjoo. \ud83d\ude02\n\nMina and Boram with getting pregnant thing this year. Good luck \ud83e\udd23\n\nThe drawing session was so fun. I think having them draw a random person to draw would be more fun!",

The editing is a little bumpy, but pretty solid in term of moderating for the episode to be not to lengthy. Overall very comfy experience.\n\nP/S: They really give Ji-So a lot of solo reaction shots. Must because of she's the most adorable being on earth lol.",

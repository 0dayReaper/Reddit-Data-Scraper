Otherwise she would continue getting criticized despite the fact that the other members aren\u2019t funnier or better than her. She was an easy target. The rest of the cast can\u2019t hide behind her and Junha anymore. And maybe with the sympathy she\u2019s getting, she can score other shows.",

Times have changed, slapstick comedy is not funny anymore. He was never great with talking. He's not quick witted. Using him as a punching bag would actually make viewers pity him than to laugh at him. He really brings nothing to the show that can be edited to be interesting. He's a big eater but his footage during meals are almost never used, because he sweats into his food and turns viewers off. \n\nI always thought they had a great cast aside from Junha. I believe Junha could have ride the wave and survived, but the PD sunk the ship. But I don't feel pity for him at all, he doesn't have a place in the comedy variety world anymore.",

I used KJK as an example, but really you could look at the whole RM cast in general, they all have to adapt and grow into different characters over time. Times change and comedy is very topical. I loved Family Outing, but those jokes won't do as well in this current time.",

Saeho guesting in RM.. \n\nJJH bullied and teased character worked in IC as it was a similar age group, all guys with no image concerns, combining individuals competition with group against PD, PMS as his main support character. Now JJH is the eldest and with variety newbies, it's difficult for him or them to actually bounce off each other and it became painfully obvious.",

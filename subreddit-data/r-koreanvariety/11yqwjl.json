    "postText": "'Peak Time' is a brand-new idol competition program in which teams battle for the chance to become the next worldwide idol group. Unlike other audition programs, its contestants consist entirely of male idols who have already debuted, whether currently active or part of a disbanded group.\n\nOnly the top 6 finalists would be able to reveal their group name on the show, and those 6 teams would be participating in a \u201cPeak Time\u201d concert tour. The final winner will receive a grand prize of 300 million won (approximately $232,932), as well as the opportunity to release a new album and hold a global showcase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**First Global Vote Results**\n\nThe rankings were based on the first global vote, which came to an end on March 16 at 12:30 a.m. KST, plus the various benefits that were awarded to the winners of each round. Only the top eight teams will be advancing to the next round. &gt;!However, there was a twist in store: Lee Seung Gi surprised the contestants by revealing that aside from the top eight, there would be two additional teams advancing to Round 3.!&lt;\n\n|Rank|Team|Score|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Team 13:00 (&gt;!BAE173!&lt;)|&gt;!890,829.8; R1 benefit + R2 benefit + Rap MVP (J-Min)!&lt;|\n|2|Team 11:00 (&gt;!VANNER!&lt;)|&gt;!851,557.2; R1 benefit + R2 benefit!&lt;|\n|3|Team 23:00 (&gt;!DGNA!&lt;)|&gt;!799,797.4; R1 benefit + R2 benefit!&lt;|\n|4|Team 20:00 (&gt;!M.O.N.T!&lt;)|&gt;!712,786.2; R1 benefit + R2 benefit!&lt;|\n|5|Team 8:00 (&gt;!DKB!&lt;)|&gt;!679,753; R1 benefit + R2 benefit!&lt;|\n|6|Team 24:00 (&gt;!Soloists - Moon Jong Up (B.A.P), Heedo (B.I.G), Kim Byung Joo (TOPPDOGG), &amp; Gon (ARGON)!&lt;)|&gt;!602,539.6; R2 benefit + Dance MVP (B.A.P\u2019s Moon Jong Up)!&lt;|\n|7|Team 14:00 (&gt;!GHOST9!&lt;)|&gt;!578,334.7; R2 benefit + Vocal MVP (Choi Junseong)!&lt;|\n|8|Team 15:00 (&gt;!BLK!&lt;)|&gt;!498,314.2; R1 benefit + R2 benefit!&lt;|\n|\\-|Team 7:00 (&gt;!MASC!&lt;)|&gt;!Had the next highest pure global voting score without the benefits!&lt;|\n|\\-|Team 2:00 (&gt;!NTX!&lt;)|&gt;!Chosen by juding panel based on perceived potential!&lt;|\n\n* The eliminated teams are: Team 1:00 (&gt;!DIGNITY!&lt;), Team 4:00 (&gt;!BXB!&lt;), , Team 5:00 (&gt;!ATBO!&lt;), Team 9:00 (&gt;!BLITZERS!&lt;), Team 18:00 (&gt;!BDC!&lt;), and Team 21:00 (&gt;!24K!&lt;).\n* ['Peak Time' Ranking History](https://www.mykpopshows.com/peak-time-global-voting-results)",

The 2% and pure fan votes &gt;!(though it did save Team 7)!&lt; barely made a difference... \n\nGlad all the teams I support advanced and &gt;!really glad Team 7 advanced as well. It would have been a pity to see a powerful vocal duo get eliminated.!&lt;\n\nEliminations are never easy man.. Seeing them break down really breaks my heart :( Hoping the best for all the eliminated teams \ud83d\ude4f And thankfully they are at least releasing the digital for all 16 teams and also giving the eliminated teams the song choreo and outfits, if not it would have been way to cruel.\n\nCan't wait for next week because we getting live cheering and the short teaser looks promising as well!!\n\nEdit: [Songs for Round 3 have been released!](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lWKbRvxgyWVLI2bmiiTOvbw6zHh10pEqY&amp;feature=share)",

Their vocal tone is honestly some of the best I\u2019ve heard. \n\nAlso, team 14\u2019s leader Joon (even though a member won mvp) is really carrying that team on his entire back. And though team 13 got number 1, and the MVP was deserved, really don\u2019t remember what they performed in earlier episodes so the fact that the MVP ranking pushed them up that far is really surprising. \n\nBut I think I would\u2019ve rioted if team 7 got eliminated. Just doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. \n\nOverall it was really sad seeing all the teams that got eliminated. They did so good especially the red haired boy who rapped really really well during the rap combined unit battle. Siwoo I think?",

There shouldn't be any life saving benefit for other groups this time around.\n\nI really disagreed with them losing their battle in round 1, and then being in group A meant no benefit in round 2. Also, they're both vocalists, so they only had a shot at the vocal MVP and didn't get it. They kinda got screwed over and over and over despite their popularity.",

His vocal performance really elevated the overall performance of his vocal unit. His voice also made the performance have this mystical and magical disney channel twist to it. I was absolutely shocked at his tone and his amazing control over his voice. You could literally see that every sound from his mouth was well intended and controlled to hit the spot. \n\nI was thinking to myself before the results got announced, that it would be such a shame to lose his voice on the show. I am looking forward to his performances and I really hope the new song match really highlights his voice.",

Is it just a region thing cuz viki has been a right pain in the gut lately and I've already been spoiled a bit (my fault entirely).\n\nedit: as i couldnt wait, i watched the raw and I misjudged how significant those mvp benefits could be. i knew the double benefit from round 1 was big but 2%, 5% just didnt seem big at first glance. i thought the ones in the top ranks were securely ahead of everyone else but 15 got by solely cuz of those benefits and the order changed quite a bit as a result. the top 9 ranks from the global voting pre-benefits + team 15 made it so while it's not a big upset or anything, if these rounds continue to give these types of benefits then nobody is safe from elimination if they get a bad round.\n\nwhile i dont agree with the mvp winners personally, it made for some super interesting changes in the ranks which at least helped offset some of that stifling and sad atmosphere of eliminated teams having to say goodbye. the one that i was sad to see go though is team 21/24k since i thought xiwoo had so much potential. my abs favs (23, 11, 8) made it quite easily but i imagine if you were rooting for the middle rank teams then this ep must've been super stressful. \n\nalso, not sure how im feeling about the digital releases cuz on one hand, some of those 6 teams will likely leave the industry on this sour note, but on the other, they at least get to show off their hard work even if they can't perform it live in front of a proper audience. at least all the songs sounded decent, a few were great in fact, so silver linings and all. the funniest thing this ep was the show, immediately after seunggi somberly gave that outro speech about the eliminations, announcing the next global votes for the top 6 teams have started and to rmb to vote. like i get why they had to announce it but just wow, no rest for the wicked i guess.",

I can't help but feel bad for team NTX who survived because of the judges, how hard they cried after they found out they made it to round 3 I could tell they are unpopular. I looked them up and from the remaining 8 teams who are still active idols they are the least known. I'm honestly rooting for everyone to succeed. After reading the comments about the BAE173 leader I want them to suceed! I think they have the most scientifically handsome members and we all know visuals matter more than your voice in kpop so they have a shot at hitting big \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

            "comment": "I thought this EP they will have to perform the new songs so I was thinking' how they will do it after receiving the news of other team got eliminated' but apparently this EP just the announcement\n\nsame with most of comment here, not that I'm being sus or anything but how is the math that team &gt;!13:00 !&lt;placed &gt;!\\#1!&lt;? It's not like I'm not rooting for them, but with the other team received MVP benefit, it's just well...yeah. But honestly, thanks to last round, I could see more of the members of this team besides &gt;!Hangyul!&lt;, I saw him both in &gt;!the Unit!&lt; and &gt;!Produce!&lt; but tbh his teammate never visible to me until last round. Or probably it's just because (I) as a viewer only see the global voting results so I thought the result based on that\n\nI'm also surprised team &gt;!7:00!&lt; originally placed &gt;!\\#10!&lt;?? I don't know how's the locals response to them but I think many people here rooting for them. I have to thank that &gt;!special judges!&lt; and &gt;!global voting pass!&lt; because it literally save &gt;!2 teams!&lt; I also rooting for. I cried hard for team&gt;! 2:00!&lt; when they made it (TTwTT) dang...I thought I won't ever cry in survival shows again lol but &gt;!Yoon Hyeok just such a sweet boy for me, he's young yet he's !&lt;~~already gone through 3 divorces~~&gt;! really serious and determined!&lt;. And I feel the group has really really good potentials\n\nfor the eliminated teams, I really wish the best. I'm glad &gt;!the production team give the composed songs &amp;outfits for them, hopefully their agency will let them perform it in music shows!&lt;. For &gt;!24k!&lt; though, I'm quite sus with their company lol, wasn't theirs like problematic or something? I just could wish the best for the &gt;!new members!&lt; there, may the future be bright for those kids",

As soon as they announced that the round 1 benefit would double the votes, I knew there'd be trouble ahead. Hopefully, the actual top 9 in votes went through anyway.",

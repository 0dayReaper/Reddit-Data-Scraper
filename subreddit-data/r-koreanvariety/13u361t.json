It felt like something worthy of a finale, especially because it was a goal that came from Hyeri herself and they just kinda ignored the goal of bingo-ing.\n\nI think the best moments come from when the cast creates the motivation themself, and overall I think the show has done a good job of creating situations for that to arise even though the concept itself didn't create that much tension. \n\nI'm looking forward to s2, I hope the PDs really think hard about how to put a twist on things. I would probably make phone use cost coins, quality food cost more, and big ticket entertainment items cost less, because this season by the second week they had already become pretty comfortable.\n\nOne thing HyeMiLeeYeChaePa has going for it is that the larger cast means there's still room for more dynamics to develop. After all, there are 15 two-member combinations. And also the episodes with Jonathan were very good, so guests can also spice up s2.",

Honestly the cast is so much fun. I went in knowing Hyeri, Chaewon and Yena but went on and love all 6 together.\n\nHyeri - Nothing much more has to be said about her. She is a veteran when it comes to variety shows. I like that they surround her with a younger cast cause wherever she goes, she is always the youngest. But it\u2019s nice to see the role reversed for her.\n\nMiyeon - So endearing and here she shows off her more softer side and an ace where it comes to games. She is also very clumsy which is so not in her image so I was entertained by that. I also liked that she is an all or nothing girl when it comes to betting points hahaha. \n\nLee Jung - I only know her as choreographer for BP and she also participated in the Street Woman Fighter tournament. She has such good chemistry with both the unnies and the maknaes. I really like the rivalry between her and Chaewon. A very competitive girl but liked to play it safe which is surprising for me. \n\nYena - Another veteran entertainer seeing that she always been everywhere and anywhere on TV. Probably the most street smart among them and she is such a good outlet to get screentime. \n\nChaewon - It\u2019s her first time doing a variety show minus the IZONE episodes. The only introvert in the group but she got louder and louder once she get comfortable with the girls. Hopeless at games but at least she look cute for the camera haha. We will always have Morning Chaewon. \n\nPatricia - The maknae and official center of the group. A very fun person to have and when her brother came over, her stress level went up. She is the wildcard of the group, knowing things that others don\u2019t or doing good at games that anyone else are not.\n\nI also like to shout out to the PD team. I like the tikitaka between them and the cast. They are strict when they need to but also gives leeway to make sure that the cast remained motivated. I think it\u2019s one of my favourite things about the show. I\u2019m looking forward to more games for Season 2 and hopefully all 6 of them returns. With a guest or two, IDM. \n\nNow it\u2019s for me to catch up on Earth Arcade.",

I hope that all of the people who participated in this program have grown at least a little over the past 6 months.\u201d\n\n&gt; In particular, PD Lee pointed out the performance of the performers one by one and did not hide his affection and trust. The message from the production team, who was sincere in making fun of Kim Chae-won until the end, brought laughter. Producer Lee Tae-kyung said, 'They were perfect and great members. I think it would be really nice to see them in season 2. \n\n&gt; However, even if it takes a long time, he added warmth by saying, 'I hope that you will find a lot of other content or advertisements through this program and that everyone will do better.'\n\n&gt; ----------------\n\n&gt; The following is a Q&amp;A with PD Lee Tae-kyung.\n\n\n&gt; \ud83d\udccc-How do you feel about the ending?\n\n&gt; 'I hadn't done many seasonal programs, so I didn't understand how it felt when the end was decided, but it was such a day that I could understand a little bit why my colleagues fell into complicated emotions after finishing the program.'\n\n&gt; 'I just remembered all the people I'm thankful for. Hyeri, Miyeon, Rijeong, Yena, Chaewon, Patricia, who willingly agreed to the casting and trusted each other with the production team, as well as the managers who worked hard during the filming, and the staff who worked hard together on set and in the post-production room. \n\n&gt; The junior PDs and writers who gathered ideas and actively thought about how to make it more interesting both on site and in the editing room; , PR team, old colleagues and acquaintances who gave feedback and certified the live broadcast shooter, and above all, I wanted to buy even a small gift for the viewers who cheered me on, enjoyed watching it, and spread word of mouth despite my shortcomings.'\n\n&gt; 'It was a project that left me with regrets that I wish I could do better, but with more pleasant memories. I also studied a lot. I hope that all of those who participated in this program were able to grow even a little during the past 6 months.'\n\n\n&gt; \ud83d\udccc-Tell me a little bit about Season 2.\n\n&gt; 'The production team and cast are all waiting for Season 2. If the time is right and the situation is right, I think we can show you a more fun and desperate season 2.'\n\n\n&gt; \ud83d\udccc- What do you want to say to the members?\n\n&gt; 'Hyeri always thought that she was a hexagonal entertainment talent, but she showed off that talent to the fullest. She has a strong sense of responsibility, so I really relied on her to take care of everything outside of the program. It could be said that her trust in Hyeri has become stronger. (I don't know what happened to Hyeri's trust in me)'\n\n\n&gt; 'Miyeon thinks she is the one who made the color of this program. She said a lot about this program, 'Everyone is cute but funny', and she thinks that she is probably the key to creating that atmosphere. Even on set and editing, she thought most of all, 'How can people be like this'. \n\n&gt; She thinks that Lee Jung-eun is a de facto leader. Looking back, all the big laughs started with Li Zheng. The production crew fell in love with the charm that appears when a fashionista collapses. These days, I live for fun by sending teasing DMs whenever Ms. Lee posts a great release.'\n\n\n&gt; \ud83d\udc25'Yena is a person who wants to film a 24-hour observation variety show. Her look, voice, tone, every action kept me watching. Everyone close to me fell in love with Yena through this program. It would have been difficult for her to join at the busiest time and adjust her schedule, but she quickly adapts and works in the right place at the right time, so I am really grateful. \n\n&gt; \ud83d\udc2fChaewon is the most natural person in everything. \n\n&gt; She doesn't feel what she thinks when she encounters a situation, and she does what she feels, but she was a really natural person who showed off her charm. The more I saw that, the more admirable it was.\n\n&gt; All Chaewon's words should be shown on the air, I remember editing with this thought in mind. So I think she will grow faster and bigger in the future, and maybe she won't be able to do Season 2 together because she getting busier.'\n\n\n&gt; 'Patricia had high expectations for her, and she exceeded them. She was innocent yet honest, passionate and funny, and she even got the impression that she was good at entertainment, to the point where I wondered where she learned it. \n\n&gt; She believes in what she said she likes K-pop in the pre-interview, and she did a music mission, but she never thought that she would carry hard alone like that. Rather, it is regrettable that she did not show all her charms through broadcasting. She was a perfect and wonderful member without a doubt. She thinks it would be great if we met her in season 2. \n\n&gt; But even if it takes a long time, she finds a lot of other content or commercials through this program and I hope it works out for everyone.'\n\n\n&gt; \u270d\ud83c\udffbReporter Soyoung Hwang, Enter News Team",

And Boxabl should sponsor it.",

Not to mention they already have to try to keep prep and filming time at a minimum to accommodate schedules, it's just easier to see them renting a house with a few more rooms next time and just give them the option of getting more rooms and amenities. \n\nSomething like Na PD's Earth Arcade has the benefit of being abroad and taking advantage of the inherent difficulties with procuring certain things that makes it novel and the challenges worth it but the girls in HMLYCP will likely get used to having little to nothing for a short while before cash points kick in (especially since they got a head start). I hope the show doesn't bank on that kind of content and focuses more on engaging the girls with solid games and fun discussions.",

Visually, the scale of that production will set it apart from other seasonal buddy adventure variety shows.\n\nPlus if they get it sponsored they don't need to worry about it taking up the budget since it's a promotion for the company on Netflix and other streaming platforms.",

I don't think it would \"get old\" within S2, unless they did all the same games and such but I don't expect that.\n\nWhat I do hope for is a really fun twist. My idea is they should announce that there is a second house, filled with their contemporaries, competing against them and when HyeMiLeeYeChaePa win, they can steal back what HyeMiLeeYeChaePa had won in S1. It would be insanely awesome if they could find a cast with the same names to make up HyeMiLeeYeChaePa but I highly doubt that's possible so they'd have their own supergroup mashed up name. Their contemporaries that would make up for a fantastic second group:\n\n* Chaewon: Kwon Eunbi or Chaeryeong (even if just for the running gag to pay off) or Lia\n* Yena: Chuu\n* LeeJung: Gabee\n* Patricia: Nathan\n* Hyeri: Yura (Girls Day) or Bomi or Heo Young-ji (KARA)\n* Mi-yeon: Sana (TWICE) or Jiwon aka Megan (Fromis\\_9)\n\nJust imagine the reveal, the HyeMiLeeYeChaePa going into their house to see all of their stuff gone. They come back outside complaining about where it all went and then they hear commotion as the other group pulls up in cars, gets out, and goes into their house across the street. The house which is fully furnished with HyeMiLeeYeChaePa's S1 winnings. HyeMiLeeYeChaePa run over and see them from their big front window and see all their winnings and start to freak out. The PD then explains the rules and now it's set, group vs group. With the new group experiencing the life of luxury right away but slowly losing everything until they're in a house with what HyeMiLeeYeChaePa had in episode 2.\n\nSome sort of twist like this would be amazing. Give us more episodes and have it be house versus house, with the big mission competitions outside being house vs house while the individual missions and the music/dance guessing missions are as they were in S1.",

I haven't watched season 1, but I'm a little curious now.\n\nThat paan did not look good. Why did it look like aluminum foil? They should have given him normal paan, without the fire and weird mishmash of sweet stuff.",

I don't think there's another Korean celebrity who would try half the things he did in this episode alone. I also find him to be very respectful of other people's belief like with the drink in S1. Give s1 a try, it's also very entertaining!",

    "postText": "Hello! So after watched the 1st episode I got hooked (subbed by amazing u/SharpShark222 and team), I've been trying to find RAWs but the torrents I found are too big (these far all I found are 1080p)\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew where I might could find 720p format or maybe share the files (torrent format is fine)? Or if it's possible is there any websites to stream?\n\nThank you in advance!",

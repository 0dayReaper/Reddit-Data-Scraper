I can\u2019t help but feel bad for the guests since they quite literally hop on and act as an audience member for 80% of their time there. I don\u2019t feel significance of dividing up into teams either than having stronger reactors on both sides as well. It\u2019s okay but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll meet the same high that got KHD his daesang way back when.",

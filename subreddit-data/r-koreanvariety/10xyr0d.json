If you\u2019re a fan of hospital playlist, the casts had an 8 or 9 episode season in three meals a day. On the other hand, house on wheels is kind of like unexpected business where they have a set member and a few celebrities visit, but they don\u2019t really do any actual work. They mainly just sight see and cook because each episode they go to a different place.",

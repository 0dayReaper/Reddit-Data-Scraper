Lmao.\n\nI didn't expect the show to turn into a dating show!  That insert was so funny!\n\nThis episode is probably the funniest episode with the new 6-member cast. All these managers have good variety show skills and are effortlessly hilarious. And Joo PD is always a scene stealer. lol",

Is their main responsibility to get them to wherever they have to go on time and ready to perform?  Are they also like social secretaries, managing their work schedules?  \n\nSame kind of deal with their stylists?  Do the stylists tell them what to wear and provide them the clothes?  They seem to wear different clothes every week - are these rented from their agencies?  So many questions...",

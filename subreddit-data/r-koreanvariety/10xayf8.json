that **GV SeungHye** bobbles, **BD Lisa** comes in with a quick pass to an open **BD SeoGi** in the box and to the left side distancing herself from the man-to-man defense of **GV NaMi**, **BD SeoGi** has room and her first touch keeps the ball at her feet, **GV HyeRyun** closes the angle on the shot by stepping forward and pretty much making a brilliant smothering save!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' GV Miss: **GV NaMi** takes a corner kick-in with a good rolling pass to **GV HyeSun** who takes a shot on goal that hits **GV MinKyung** the ball the bounces out to **GV SeungHye** who takes a power shot on target and hits the middle of the rightside goalpost! the ball stays in play but nothing comes of it!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' BD Miss: **BD SeungYeon** takes a sideline kick-in deep in BD zone with a pass to **BD MinSeo**, who kicks the ball down the middle that **GV HyeSun** bobbles, **BD KyungSeo** pounces on the mistake and takes the ball from **GV HyeSun**, now there is a foot race towards the goal between **BD KyungSeo** and **GV HyeSun**, **BD KyungSeo** manages to get a shot on target and hits the bottom of the left goalpost! the ball goes out for a corner kick, **GV HyeSun** got her foot on the ball to mess up the original shot!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~4' GV Miss: **GV SeungHye** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot on net in front of the goal mouth of congregated players, the ball hits **GV EunHyung** and pinballs around a bit, **GV NaMi** manages to get a toe on the ball and gets a shot which hits the bottom right goalpost! it goes out of bounds for a goal-kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~5' GV Miss: **GV HyeRyun** kicks the ball in play and **BD SeungYeon** doesn't play it well and the ball bounces out to **GV HyeSun** who passes the ball to **GV NaMi** on the opposite side,  **GV NaMi**'s first touch is terrible and she deflects the ball on target where **BD MinSeo** smothers it, could've been a trap and shot on goal, but poor technical skills on **GV NaMi** resulted in a full deflection on goal!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' BD Miss: **BD KyungSeo** and **BD SeoGi** get a rare chance to do some give-and-go passing from the stifling man-to-man defense scheme of GV, they get a shot off from **BD SeoGi** but she shot at **GV HyeRyun** who had no issues catching the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' GV Miss: **GV SeungHye** takes a sideline kick-in deep in GV zone with a shot on net in front of the goal where **GV EunHyung** runs to beating **BD Lisa**'s mark, she gets a terrible weak one-time shot on goal that **BD MinSeo** mishandles and gives a rebound right back to **GV EunHyung** who takes another shot but off target to the left side and out of bounds!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' BD Foul: **BD SeungYeon** goes over the ten second time limit to complete a sideline kick-in, the ball is now GV's and it's deep in BD territory, **GV NaMi** to take the sideline kick-in!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' GV Miss: **GV NaMi** takes a sideline kick-in power cross pass that **BD SeungYeon** just barely misses a touch on, but **GV SeungHye** gets a one-time shot on target only to hit the bottom right area of the goalpost, the deflection goes straight to the BD goal mouth but no following shot attempt is made, the ball goes out of bounds for a sideline kick-in for GV!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' BD INJURY: **BD SeoGi** makes a successful defensive tackle on a charging **GV HyeSun**, **GV HyeSun** goes down but the collision affected **BD SeoGi** more than the sturdy and powerful thick-thighs of **GV HyeSun**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!9' GV GOAL: **GV SeungHye** takes a sideline kick-in around the centerline with a delicious rolling pass to **GV HyeSun** who was calling for it earlier, **GV HyeSun**'s first touch to keep the ball in front of her evades **BD Lisa** and with a bit of space and time to shoot, **GV HyeSun** kicks an even more delicious rolling ball to the left side where **GV MinKyung** re-directs to the low right side of the net, **BD MinSeo**'s lateral movement from the ball going from one side to the other caught her a bit out of position and the ball goes in!&lt;\n\n\nHALFTIME SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- Gaevengers 1 - 0  BallaDream ----**Lee YoungPyo**'s man-to-man defense is stifling BD offense, **SeoGi** injuring her right thigh isn't helping BD either, what will we see in the 2nd half?  can BD overcome GV defense?  will we see **Kim TaeYoung** come up with a counter strategy to GV's planning?------!&lt;\n\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~10' GV Foul: **GV SeungHye** getting a bit handsy with her defensive approach and pushes **BD KyungSeo** from behind, a direct free-kick is awarded just outside of the 16yard box (not actually 16yards away), **BD Coach TaeYoung** instructs **BD KyungSeo** to take a shot on target!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~10' BD Miss: **BD KyungSeo** takes the direct free-kick with a power shot on target, but into the defensive wall and **GV SeungHye** gets her chest on the shot to redeem herself for the foul, the ball goes out of bounds for a deep sideline kick-in, a pause is taken to see if **GV SeungHye** is okay!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' BD Miss: **BD MoonTak** gives an outlet pass to **BD Lisa**, who then passes it to **BD KyungSeo** on the opposite wing, who takes a shot on target for **GV HyeSun** to catch the ball, this BD chance was due to the ball being in transition and GV was out of position on their defensive markings!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' GV Miss: **BD SeungYeon** messes up her first touch and a cutting **GV NaMi** gets the ball from her, the ball is too fast for **GV NaMi** to get a shot off, **BD MinSeo** leaves the net to smother the high risk ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!11' BD GOAL: **BD KyungSeo** takes a direct free kick from a handball foul from **GV NaMi**, she shoots on net towards **BD MoonTak** who heads the ball, the ball is re-directed and hits the bottom left post and deflects towards the goal mouth, **BD Lisa** is there to bury the rebound in the net, **GV HyeRyun** was a bit too slow to make the save, **BD Lisa** gets her first league goal!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' BD Miss: **BD KyungSeo** takes a sideline kick-in with a cross to **BD MoonTak** who gets just enough on the shot to make it to the net but the ball was slow and aimed perfectly to avoid all the GV defenders' legs but not passed **GV HyeRyun**'s left leg, the ball is smothered!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' GV Miss: **BD EunHyung** takes a corner kick-in with a pass to top of the 16yard box with **BD SeungHye** cutting into the spot and **BD MinKyung** running a screen on the defender, **BD SeungHye** takes a low shot to the front of the goal mouth, and **BD MinKyung** gets her toe on it for a re-direction, the ball goes wide right by about a foot!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' BD Miss: **BD MinSeo** takes a pass from a sideline kick-in and passes the ball to **BD KyungSeo** who is marked tightly by **GV HyeSun** she turns around and passes it to **BD Lisa** who does a little give-and-go back to **BD KyungSeo** who takes a shot but not on target, **GV HyeRyun** followed the play and was in position to stop a good shot!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' GV Foul: **BD MoonTak** goes down after a hard tackle from **GV SeungHye**, **BD MoonTak** gets up, a direct free-kick is awarded just outside of the 16yard box, **BD KyungSeo** takes a shot but into the defensive wall and no real chance is generated!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' GV Miss: **BD KyungSeo** shoots a sideline kick-in at **GV MinKyung** who blocks it and kicks an outlet pass down the field for a sprinting **GV HyeSun**, **GV HyeSun** has a clear open field in front of her and takes a weak shot on target but **BD MinSeo** comes up big with a save and ball smother for no rebound!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' GV Miss: **BD SEungYeon** back passes to **BD KyungSeo** but **GV MinKyung** gets her foot out and deflects towards **GV EunHyung** who follows it up with a decent shot on target that **BD MinSEo** catches into her chest and gives no rebound!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~20' GV Miss: **BD SEungYeon** clears the ball forward but **GV SeungHye** intercepts the ball and dekes out 3 BD defenders to take a clear open shot on net, her shot is off target on the left wide side about two feet, the whistle blows for the game's end, we are going to a PENALTY SHOOT OUT that will decide so much!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!SHOOT OUT, GV shoots first, BD goalie = **MinSeo** -------------------- GV goalie = **HyeRyun**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!**GV SHOT 1** - GV Miss: : **MinKyung** shoots with power down the middle, **MinSeo** stands tall and blocks the ball with her hands!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!**BD SHOT 1** - BD Miss: : **KyungSeo** shoots with power down the middle, **HyeRyun** moves slightly to her right to make the save as she favored her left side, the ball bounces favorably out for GV!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!**GV SHOT 2** - GV GOAL: : **NaMi** shoots with some power to the bottom left corner, **MinSeo** a bit too slow in her movement, she got her fingertips on the ball in the slow-mo replay!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!**BD SHOT 2** - BD Miss: : **SeoGi** shoots with power down the middle, **HyeRyun** makes the clear save after attacking her rightside, again she positioned herself off center to her left !&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!**GV SHOT 3** - GV GOAL: : **SeungHye** shoots a speedy low rolling shot to the left, **MinSeo** a bit too slow in her movement, the ball rolled over her right foot and in!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!**BD SHOT 3** - BD Miss: : **MoonTak** shoots with power to the right side, hits the GOAL POST and out!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!**GV SHOT 4** - GV GOAL: : **HyeSun** shoots a power shot that hits the crossbar, the deflection goes in and bounces out and a bit of confusion if it was a goal ensues, the ball was hit so hard the bounces were fast!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!**BD SHOT 4** - BD NO SHOT: : --------------------------------------------------no shot, GV wins-----------------------------------------------------!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!**GV SHOT 5** - GV NO SHOT: : --------------------------------------------------no shot, GV wins-----------------------------------------------------!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!**BD SHOT 5** - BD NO SHOT: : --------------------------------------------------no shot, GV wins-----------------------------------------------------!&lt; \n\nFINAL SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- **Gaevengers (3) 1** - 1 (0) BallaDream ----------------, **GV HyeRyun** is the master of PK goalkeeping, great defensive effort by GV, BD have been relegated to ChallengeLeague, GV have been promoted back into SuperLeague!&lt;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!looks like there will be a fun All-star game with a massive crowd

They can't seem to find the groove to be a stable contending team. I would had thought that Seogi's injury could be a killing blow to finish off Balladream. However they just could not do it. Kudos to MoonTak and Lisa for showing up when the team needed to. Excited to see their growth next season if they stay with the team.\n\nAs for GV, revamping the attacking core might be a way to do it. At least they have a deep talent pool to recruit, judging from the audition episode for the team. At least most of the team (except Seun Hye and EunYoung) need to go back to the basic techniques. At this level they should know a proper way of kicking the ball instead of toe kicks. Even the 6th member of all the team knew not to kick that way, and Gavs just squandered a few opportunities with it. Just mind boggling!",

            "comment": "Before we start:\n\nCho HaeRyun is the best GK for penalty shoot-out. She basically psyched out the kicker and told them where she wanted the ball ball to be shot to. Just amazing.\n\nOverall is was a smelly, ugly match all around, since brain-fart made an appearance again. Both teams were unable to take advantage of each other weakness, especially &gt;!FC Gavengers!&lt;.&gt;! They will not survive the Super League next season like this!&lt;.\n\nThis game clearly showed that all 6 players in the team need to have some familiarity to the football flow and contributed to the team. It was so glaring when the key player was unable to play. Why do you think FC TopGirl, FC Gucheok and FC WorldClass were a strong team this season? Because all of them know the positioning and flow of the game, and played confidently. The coach can substitute the 6th player and know she will not damage the team. Just look at DaYoung (TG) and SeoRin (GC), they played confidently and know their roles in the game. FC Actionista needs to upgrade JiIn and YooYoung for next season, or else they will not have a lucky run like this season. FC WorldClass has a balance and skillful team, but they still lack the confidence when they played. If by next season they still can trust their own skills, they will not make it to the top 4 in Super League.\n\nFC Gaevengers has a stable defense core but still a clueless offensive core, Maybe they need to switched out NaMi and MinKyoung for next season. They showed no growth in skills and understanding even after playing for two years. FC Balladdream just realized how important was the other teammates when the Seo duo were obliterated in the game, which going to happen from now on. So far this season only those two contributed to the team's run. There will be no tiki taka if you take out the tiki, period. Which is what was shown in this game. Lisa and MoonTak showed an amazing potential for gwoth next season if they stick with it.",

I fail to see how the coach failed. Also, Seogi and Kyoung Seo are the corest of core BD players and they score nearly every PK they kick. What are you talking about?",

Just because you train on something, even with the best duo in the league on your team, doesn't mean you are going to get perfect results every time. Especially against the best PK goalie on the show. ESPECIALLY when your ace has an injured kicking leg thigh.\n\n&gt;Did I say the coach failed? No. don't put words into my mouth.\n\nSo how do you define \"failed\" then?\n\n&gt;BD's coach should blame himself while having the best/most exciting duo in the league, it's a disappointing result. They should train PKs more given that most of their games ended up in shootouts.\n\nThe coach should blame himself for... his success? No?\n\nAh yes, he should blame himself for his FAILURE to succeed with the \"best/most exciting duo in the league\". His FAILURE to \"train PKs more given that most of their games ended up in shootouts.\"\n\nThat is the only way what you said (coach should blame himself for the disappointing result while having such talent on his team and for what happened with the PK's) makes any sense.\n\nFact is most of what you said is wrong.\n\n&gt;None of their core players can score PKs confidently.\n\nSeogi and Kyoung Seo are arguably the BEST penalty kickers on the show and they are core players #1 and #2 on FC BD. They did train PK's. Lastly, it's unfair to watch that game and place the blame on the HC when his star player, the player who is basically required for the offense to work, got hurt. \n\nBD doesn't just play to \"entertain the crowd\", they are the best at tiki taka and it's how they score. Seogi isn't an all rounder who can be used in other (more physical or speed reliant) ways so changing how the team plays would just diminish her impact. If Seogi had stayed healthy they would have most likely won, plain and simple. Then the HC wouldn't have been mentioned at all as someone who should blame himself or be disappointed. HC's of any team sport can only do so much when their star player(s) get hurt. Especially so in amateur leagues.",

This game is so hard to watch now.\n\nWow i've never seen ballad coach so fired up before. His speech at half time was like out of a movie.\n\nI like how the example of \"the goal everyone created as one team\" that they showed from the Ballad vs FM match was 100% KS lol \n\nYay lisa's debut goal!!!

It's her first shootout as GK.\n\nOmg i can't believe the first two shots were both blocked. \n\nShit HL GK is on fire today. I think gav are gonna go 7-7 for shootouts.\n\nThat was so bittersweet. Without SG's injury i wonder if they could have won. Gav was def the luckier team this game, and they killed the shootout.\n\nAt least we'll still see ballad in the challenge league! I'm excited to meet their new player too.\n\nOmg all the all stars teams are stacked!!! My money is on the super league (blue) team tho. So cool that there will be an audience!",

Unfortunately I think I gotta savor every last second of it I get cause I think SBS are morons and are going to truly \"suspend\" Anaconda and we won't see them at all on TV until the next season. So dumb. If they really can fund a BS dating show spin-off but not a spin-off for the suspended team then SBS and the Shooting Stars PD can go play on the freeway. \n\nSecondly, holy shit what stacked teams!!!!!!!! Team blue with He-In, Bo-kyung, Seogi, Kyoung Seo, and Kyung Hee. Team red with Taejin, Kang Soyeon, Kim Gayoung and Sun Young. SWEET! Though team blue is STACKED imo and should win. \n\nThird and lastly, an audience! Should add electricity. How fun. Honestly, the teaser footage is just -chefs kiss-. That level of play is what I wish we were getting weekly. \n\nI am not on team \"\\_\\_\\_\\_ and \\_\\_\\_\\_ players need to be upgraded\" like this is a pro sport. Yes, some players aren't that good or are even bad, but so was nearly everyone in season one. I'd feel awful if the PD started firing cast members because their play wasn't good enough. If this show didn't want to be about growth and the journey of newbie to quality amateur then it shouldn't have started that way. \n\nBut with all that said, this show shines brightest when the players are playing at a relatively high level, skills-wise. I suspect the All Star game is going to be filled with accurate passing, accurate shooting, quality individual ball skills and smart plays. It always hits like a ton of bricks when you go from the All Star game with all that to the regular game(s) the next season which brings the return of mediocre passing, mediocre shooting, mid ball skills and so on.\n\nIt would be dope if this All Star game, considering half of the players are playing one half and the other half are playing another, was longer in time. If it's just 10 and 10 minutes, that's gonna be a bummer. Should be at least 15-15. \n\nLastly, I hope this upcoming season brings a big surprise of some sort. The return of Song Sohee or something. That or give me my \"suspended\" team gets a spin-off series in which we watch them get private training to help them develop.",

            "comment": "This was such a bummer of a match. After the amazing game last week from BD this bummed me out. Of course some of it wasn't in their control. First, Seogi got hurt. Seogi, want to step your game up? Hit the gym. She now has a history of strains &amp; getting overworked to the point she can't play and it's compromising her availability for the team. I hope she hit the gym during the break to come back next season with upgrade fitness (specifically thighs). And second, Gaevengers man-to-man defense worked. Of course, even without Segoi, BD was starting to make things happen anyways but for the most part they didn't have a counter to Gaevengers M2M def. \n\nSucks though. BD deserves to be in the Super League. Gaevengers are my least favorite team and I think BD are my favorite so this sucked. \n\nI did not like the dirty play from Kim Seung-Hye. The stuff she did to Kyoung Seo was dirty and the tripping she did on Tak was dangerous and amateurish. \n\nProps to the Gaevengers goalie for baiting the BD players on the PK's. It's a no brainer to use that method given how small the goal is and how almost every amateur player is going to be too tempted to shoot for the wide open side and scared to shoot at the completely covered side. That method means the goalie while moving quickly to the other side is covering both the middle and previously wide open side. You have to have confidence and shoot at where she was standing first. \n\nMajor props to Minseo. I think it's arguable she is the best GK on the show and she just recently started as a GK, in an emergency situation (they lost Park Ki Young due to injury), and even in here she was memed as a must replace and \"I'm scared as long as she is their GK\" and now look at her. First off she seems to always be in great position, she seems to make really good decisions, she by FAR has the best ball skills when it comes to being part of the build up by being passed to and finding someone to pass it accurately, she has the best ball throw of anyone on the show, and she is the best verbally. Even though she is relatively young and new to soccer and GK'ing, she is back there screaming at older women (celebs, on TV) directing them as to where they should and shouldn't be. Bravo Minseo. You're killing it. \n\nGoodbye to Seung Yeon. She occasionally did some nice things as a shooter from a distance on set plays but overall her play level was fairly average as a defender. When the other team came at her it was 50/50 whether she'd block it or they'd get by her. She was mainly only good for kicking the ball out of bounds and occasionally passing it to the other team. If she kept playing, who knows, she could have taken steps forward like Yubin did this season. But we won't find out, and it provides BD a huge opportunity to get even better. They've got the offensive weapons (best duo on the show), they've got a really good GK, and Lisa is an above average support player already. Can they move Tak to Def and recruit yet another talented player to play midfield or offense? If not that, can they recruit someone to take Seung Yeon's spot on defense that is an instant upgrade? We'll have to wait and see.",

They can also try an attacking GK if Minseo will stay in that role, so it will be a total futsal style that can change the landscape of the league.",

Both Hye are the only players getting better. Even so, it is really slow. They played 2 years more already and trained under real coaches. Crazy how they are still stagnant as a team.",

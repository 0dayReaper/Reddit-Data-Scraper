Sure this show is probably set to only last 1 day but there are some other shows that last probably just a few days more and people still consider love possible.  Basically the main point is for people to meet other people on the show as a true blind date and hopefully build on from that point on rather than group them together for a longer period.",

He's being so direct despite being unable to make eye contact \ud83d\ude05\n\nThe lunchbox exchange segment was soooo funny and savage. I can't believe there were &gt;!0!&lt; mutual picks for the first 6 people. It was nice that PDs prepared lunchboxes in case someone wouldn't get one. Wow so far the 1st 3 women picked their first match and the 1st 3 men picked their 2nd match. So interesting. I guess it shows how women are less risk averse on average? \n\nWho will &gt;!GY!&lt; pick for the lunchbox??? Awww a match! I think &gt;!SJ!&lt; would have been heartbroken if she picked someone she didn't even talk to. I'm glad &gt;!everyone!&lt; got one too. \n\nOk now i'm kinda shipping the reporter and the psychiatrist \ud83e\udd14 i like how bc it's such a short period of time, anything can happen and change.\n\nThey omitted so many of the 5 min rotation convos so it's hard to say who will pick who... but i can kinda see youtuber x model. \n\nJS calling out &gt;!GY!&lt; for having pressed skip \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48 so savage \n\n&gt;!YG!&lt; skipped????

The guesthouse owner liked the reporter until she didnt choose him for the lunchbox, and she herself said she doesn't like when her partner is too chatty, so she only saw him as a friend. The last guy was only focussed on the flight attendant from beginning to end. Not sure you can \"prove\" anything with such a small sample.\n\nThe next group seems bolder so maybe we'll see different results!",

Did you watch season 1 of single's inferno? Arguably the 3 most confident and more extroverted women were selected in the end (in addition to 1 that would fit the more quiet/innocent stereotype).",

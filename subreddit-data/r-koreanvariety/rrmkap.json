Kei was always the face of he group and Woolim really pushed her hard but Mijoo never gave up. While the rest of her group played the cute or the girl next door mode - Mijoo played the sexy/proactive/fun card. It worked! \n\nNow that she's part of YJS group she'll probably be riding Cloud 9 for a while. Well deserved indeed!",

But somewhere along gen 3 things changed and now idols rarely go on variety shows, leading to them being poor at it (most of them).  \n\n\nAnd very few dare to stick out from the crowd by letting loose and just go crazy. They care sooo much about their images nowadays compared to back in the days, maybe because netizens nowadays bitch about every silly little thing and labels have given netizens too much power over what is deemed good/bad",

He is better than almost all current entertainers in the industry at what he does (including YJS, KHD). There is a reason he is in so much demand always\n\nedit- added first line\n\nedit2- studio shows in a way require more effort than outdoor shows in some ways. while for outdoor shows, the mc must also have physical stamina as well as skills  to keep the conversation, studio mcs just require the ability to keep the ability to keep the conversation going. However, since there is no action to distract the audience in studio shows, studio mcs need better conversational and hosting skills than outdoor mcs",

On IM2, all he does is pick names from a bucket, turn it to the camera, and announce them. That is as low effort as possible to earn a paycheck. On AS, he is by far the least involved. He doesn't add anything to what they hear, he can't dance, and he isn't even funny. He spends the time trying to get out of the shooting ASAP. It's not IM2 level do-nothing, but damn near close. He could be replaced by a rock just put in his chair and AS would actually be better since other people would get more time. Hell, it would even be funnier  to cut to the rock in his place than it ever was to cut to him.",

He have done more than \u201cjust announce the name\u201d since he have to interact with the audiences (not showing on air, of course), talking to the guests after the performance and talking to the legend singer of each episode who some of them are respectable people in the industry. These aren\u2019t an easy task and not everyone can do it smoothly.\n\nI agree that he doesn\u2019t contribute that much in Amazing Saturday but as he said in the show, he is the representative of middle-age group who have more basic knowledge of 70s-80s which created more variety for the cast in the show. He may not be a great contributor in solving the question but he always raise some points during the question for other casts to figure it out and create conversations. Also, he has a quick sense as he is the one who always steal the answer when other people makes a mistake in the snack time. I don\u2019t think he is useless at all.",

He is one of the most booked people in the industry(which is a testament to the fact that he does extremely good work and cannot be easily replaced by other mcs).\n\nIn immortal songs 2 much of what he does probably is not shown. cuz his job there is more to deal with the audience. secondly, even tho his role on camera is so restricted, he still does manage to shine during those moments cuz of his witty comments. so no, he is not replaceable on immortal songs. I doubt many can replace him in that show.\n\nIts a freaking singing competition, what else do u want him to do? he does his job as a good mc. do u want him to sing too?\n\nFor amazing saturday, i did not watch it so i cannot comment on it.\n\nHe has always been extremely good at understanding what the show requires of him and what the producer wants him to do from the get go and doing exactly that. and many even top star mcs cant do this. (yjs in same bed, different dreams, sugarman s1, Yoo quiz on the block s1,). (YJS gets a LOTTT better in following seasons of sugarman, yoo quiz on the block. cuz i guess YJS requires a bit of time to ramp up)\n\nJust using a few shows of his as an example to demonstrate his incapability to do sth is extremely disingenouous\n\nedit- i used YJS as an example..not because I think SDY is better than him. But because, Ive just watched a lot of YJS shows, so its easier for me to use him as an example. I do think YJS is also better than SDY in some respects.

(well in this note i think i do deserve the down-votes for botching my delivery, but it's fine) Just wanted to express how confusing awards are when it can be so spot-on such as Mijoo getting her awards. I find the other awards (here and in other channel awards) which are less discussed off are awards given to older entertainers who has shows where they just sit around and sometimes do nothing. just used SDY as an example as he was the more famous one who gets the awards almost effortlessly (as other older entertainers do) which i attribute to being old as sokor society tend to award people for reaching end-game age. which is why it is less discussed as it seems that everyone just chalks it up as a win for the oldies for surviving that long in the industry. I find that so confusing when they have awards awarding rookies, just make an old man award then and leave other awards for younger entertainers. i wished they rewarded younger entertainers as it feels like a territory game sometimes as in their industry, it is who you know that matters. It might make shows more interesting.",

The thing about these award shows to remember is that they are 'single-network' shows. The network itself is deciding who to reward or congratulate. It's not like in the US you have the Emmy awards for television or the Golden Globes for TV &amp; movies where you have all different networks nominated and reporters/other voters are voting for them.\n\nThis does happen in the Baeksang Awards. Which vote for all networks by a newspaper\n\nbut a lot of the voting in these network awards are also seen as a way of 'rewarding/keeping happy' people those networks WANT to keep WORKING for them. Sometimes this can be younger talent they want to keep a relationship with (MBC has done this with Hwasa, now with Mijoo)\n\nAs to the whole 'just sitting down' thing. I think one of the networks used to separate 'talk shows/panel shows' from 'variety shows'. I don't know that they do it anymore though.",

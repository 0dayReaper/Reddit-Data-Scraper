It's not like some other parents (*cough* Sam *cough*) who are still acting like they're on the show. \n\nThey moved into Hwi Jae's childhood home and renovated it, which is where his wife also opened up a flower shop. Hwi Jae is still hosting shows here and there and all in all, they're living a happy life. Thier situation is very similar to the triplets too, both have enough money to last so they're just having a good time lol. \n\nI'm curious to see why you saw thier relationship in a bad light? Personally, I didn't really see it.",

But,I think I just see that hwi Jae seems very emotionally unavailable to his wife, and they appear awkward with one another. I know cameras are there and PDA isnt as acceptable in korea, but I guess I get the vibe they are not that affectionate in real life, thus, the moments where they are meant to look like they love each other on the show comes across as very forced and awkward. \n\nthen again, I could be over thinking everything but I just have a vibe lol. I also compare everyone to song il look who I just think is so sweet and loving to his wife.. comes across way more genuinely than hwi Jae. \n\nI do have love for moon jung won tho. I think she\u2019s very sweet and prob goes through a lot with the twins.",

She had never had a bf before so I can only assume it's bc she's quite religious or conservative, which might explain the lack of skinship on camera. \n\nAnd I also remember she was teasing him about something and he tried to cover her mouth with her hair (it might have been when she said the above? It's all kind of blending together for me). He also put on a few surprise events for her that were nice. \n\nYou can kinda compare it to choo sung hoon and yano shiho. CSH hated being affectionate on camera even when his wife tried to initiate hugs or kisses.\n\nSong Il Gook is like the perfect dad/husband so no one will hold a candle to him lol",

No wonder I haven't seen him around lately. \n\nIt's definitely interesting because the article compares him to Kim Gura (who I will *always* side eye) and says he has the same hosting style, but attacks weaker people or falters in his arguments. That's the first time I've seen that comparison, but it's definitely on the nose.",

I got disappointed at him (LHJ) when he gave a subtle middle finger to HyungDon on a show that I've watched on KBS World more than a decade ago. \n\nSpeaking of which, he was really popular back then and I saw him on many KBS shows. But I noticed that he declined after Yoo Jae Suk and Ho Dong got more famous than him.",

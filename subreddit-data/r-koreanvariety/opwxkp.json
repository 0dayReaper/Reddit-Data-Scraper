Although he was tested negative, he entered self-isolation as a close contact. As a result, the recording of \"Sixth Sense 2,\" which was scheduled for tomorrow (24th), has been postponed.\n\nCurrently, Yoo Jae-seok is doing MBC's \"Hangout with Yoo Quiz on the Block\" and \"Sixth Sense 2\".He is starring in SBS' Running Man. Recently, he signed an exclusive contract with his agency Antenna to announce a new start.\n\n[source](https://news.jtbc.joins.com/article/article.aspx?news_id=NB12017328)",

Rather it is called hangout with yoo in english.\n\nThe official Instagram page name is in English and the name of the page is \"hangout\\_with\\_yoo\". I'm guessing the show organisers made this page\n\nthis is their official instagram- [https://www.instagram.com/hangout\\_with\\_yoo/](https://www.instagram.com/hangout_with_yoo/)\n\nedit-but yeah the korean one doesnt make reference to his name. and the show's korean title was made based on something that yjs often said to kth pd and it was not actually based on his name.\n\nhowever, in the english language, i guess since there was a chance to introduce wordplay into the title, the official english name is now \"hangout with yoo\"",

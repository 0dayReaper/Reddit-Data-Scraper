            "comment": "&gt;!YunB is hilariously bad at strategy. And playing obvious politics among smart people who like each other more than they like you doesn't work, who knew!!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I maintain that Jimin selecting Xihsuh to join the jungle team was the single best move this entire season. He's a good team player and very intelligent. Kind of iconic how YunB is so thirsty to be solo winner every round, and Xitsuh just goes and does it.!&lt;\n\nEp 7:\n\n&gt;!The time game got so messy. That second round where everyone was fighting over the 7 point slot was funny. I don't know how Pi and Mina messed that up, they're a 3 person alliance! It's not a lot to keep track of. Mina was not good at this game.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Trust Jinho to find a way for his team to avoid last place with 100% certainty. I don't think he's the best at winning, necessarily. But if there's a way to keep risk to the absolute minimum, he's always going to see it. Which is probably why he goes so far in these shows.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Mina had questionable choice in deathmatch contestants in ep 7. I understand she didn't have much time to form bonds with the other team, but I think she was too attached to people who outcasted her. She should have selected people she knew more about. And she probably got a bit complacent.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Ep 8 was yet another case of Jinho and Xitsuh running away with their winning ways. Pi has herself a nice spot I think, where people don't think she's completely self-centred (like Jinhyeong) but she can switch sides and people don't fault her for it. Pi telling the Jinho and Xitsuh that the other team has a winning strategy, but not selling out said strategy was an interesting move. It doesn't affect her either way, but goes to show she (rightfully) doesn't care that much for her old team.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Deathmatch was great. Knucks is undeniably smart but Jinho was always a step ahead. Something about living in the jungle, hobbling around on one foot and having teammates to focus on really makes him a much more threatening player than in The Time Hotel \ud83d\ude02 I'm here for it.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Hope Yurisa beats YunB lol!!!&lt;",

I dont think he'd ever choose Hyunji and they would never let her get picked anyway. \n\nTaking Dex out hurts their chances of winning a physical game. And Xitsuh has been clutch for them in a support role, not as smart or physical as either Dex or Jinho but comfortably in the middle. \n\nInstead Knucks is out and the OG jungle team have a physical and mental edge. All they had to do was band together for a 5v4 but Knucks was basically 1v4 as the other 4 secured their own positions.",

            "comment": "Hm. YunB and Knucks are the two most well balanced players but their flaws are their emotions. Yurisa was dead on with how they\u2019re logical to a certain point but become emotional and ruins it. I thought YunB read people better, but him thinking HyunJi and Dex is gonna betray their team is such a cosmic faroff calculation, the two of them are loyalists and it\u2019s written on their foreheads. I still like YunB for making things interesting though, I\u2019ll take him as a fun villain over Pie/Jinhyung\u2019s play any day. Their mentality is not fun to see.\n\nAlso I notice there are two conditions in which Jinho become very good and Bloody Game 2 somehow full-filled both: 1. Strategize-able games; 2. A Loyal Team. Him being chosen by Jimin was a Godsend, it\u2019s his first time every having a team from the start. His interviews are always so refreshing, the way he observes each game objectively and say that \u2018the game seems to be fun\u2019. Like THAT is the first thing to cross his mind? In contrast with how worried the other players are about their survival, those words really send me goosebumps. Imagine having such heavy expectations from other allies, opponents, PD, fans, and still nailing it.",

With the way deathmatch candidates get to chose their opponents it makes playing the main game almost pointless.

There are obviously other factors at play, like HJH's popularity/history in this genre, and Dex being famous and good-looking certainly doesn't hurt. Plus they were the \"underdogs\" suffering at the beginning. But also they're so fun and their personalities are great. Not completely unflawed but they mesh well, care for each other, have loyalty and chemistry. All four are funny, selfless, and capable players. On the other hand you have Yurisa's cold personality, HSJ's violent mald, Pi's pre-existing image, LJH's selfishness, YunB's greed, etc. There are so many contestants to dislike, I really wonder if anybody's rooting against the OG Jungle team.\n\n[Another un-aired OG Jungle team night at the Phantom Casino, unsubbed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAdrV7KS_oc)\nI love watching this team lol especially when they celebrate for each other.

It's like a curse to be on Mansion team and blessing to be a part of Jungle team.\n\nYunb should've know how strong the Jungle Alliance was. Winning the unfair ambush round and proceeded to win both team game. But his dumbass wants to take credit in winning the ambush round and wants to take 1st place in both individual game.",

            "comment": "Yep, very poor choice for Mina here for her DM opponents. Sigh!!! It\u2019s not even completely 1 day past since her getting gaslighted by Jinhyung, she forgot all that and still worked with him instead of starting fresh with some new people like the OG outdoor alliance. No? Okay, fine but when she lost the game and have a power to choose the opponent. Why choose both Dex and Hyunji when there is Knucks/Seungjin? Where is the story of revenge she just said at the beginning of the episode? It all went completely down the drain. Also, her change of attitude after choosing opponents was so out of character for her. Why do that to fuel opponents even more? I think her getting underestimated from her timid images like in previous DMs works better for her but this time it\u2019s clear that Dex went with full determination to win after he saw her acting like that. \n\nI clearly see that she always made minor mistakes here and there which causes her game like not communicating to her alliances in Round 2 before going in causing both her and Pi to choose the same block and thus put them in disadvantage in Round 3. Also, not stalling the time for as long as possible gives her opponents a chance to win the game. Also, she was off by 1 squares for 2 rounds in DMs which gives Dex a clue and a win for both rounds. If not for the mistake, she might win against him. Well, it\u2019s sad to see her go but unfortunately she wasn\u2019t suit for this bloody game. And I think it\u2019s best for her to go instead of more interesting players like Dex.\n\nPhantom players twist is pretty interesting and I think it\u2019s the best way to utilize eliminated players again. At first, I think the OG outdoor alliances should send 1 player from their own to prevent the other side to get advantages but then I forget that \u201cOh! It\u2019s gonna be Yurisa\u201d and had no problem at all hahaha.\n\nJinho seems to upgrade his game from Time Hotel a lot. Maybe living in this setting made his survival switch turned on. Anyway, hope OG outdoor team went far and Seungjin/Jinhyung was next. I\u2019m surprised I don\u2019t mind YunB that much as he gave us an interesting dynamic to the game and Pi seems to be not threatening that much despite her reputation.\n\nAnyway, my contestant ranking right now\n1. Jinho\n2. Dex\n3. Hyunji\n4. Xitsuh\n5. Pi\n6. YunB\n7. Jinhyung - *please leave*\n8. Seungjin - *please leave*",

I also wonder about the vote exemption for that, if it's like Immunity from one vote another survival show rather than what Knucks had that he could use whenever. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Someone FINALLY wanted to make the effort to burn through Knucks' exemption card. Everyone else was letting him skate through with that.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Jinho volunteering to go to the death match had very Dong Min from The Genius 3/4 vibes for me. I loved that.!&lt; In Dex's first reaction video to the first two episodes where they watched Mina/Pi play the Jungle Maze, Jinho mentioned that Pi was dumb for not considering the opponent's moves in playing. It makes more sense now.\n\n&gt;!Seung Jin!&lt; isn't a very good player. He's probably the deadest weight there. He's been massively shielded by the dudebro alliance. Interesting to see where he goes from there with &gt;!no Knucks.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Their masterful plan to get Xitsuh to lose was by convincing Hyunji and Dex to flip? DEX? Really? Even without the outdoors alliance bond, loyalty seems too important to him to flip like that. I'm happy Hyunji is all-in with the outdoors people, too.!&lt;\n\nLike almost everyone else... frustrated with Mina. She was growing on me after winning the second match and the end of the last episode where she pointed out that no one seemed happy she survived. &gt;!And then the start of the episode, when she pointed out that no one who said they'd bring her food had done that. When you come after Hyunji and Dex, though, I'm out. I'm glad Dex won. I doubt most of them expected him to.!&lt;\n\nYurisa is a human anime character. &gt;!The makeup was very on brand.!&lt; Just like[this video, where she shows up in this ridiculous dress and hat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3qrvpu0gKw). Whatever modeling/hosting/variety show job she can get from this, she deserves. &gt;!Hope she destroys YunB.!&lt;\n\nFour isn't a good number for getting to the end considering they will always have two people eligible to be voted for/sent to the death match, but I'd like the outdoors team to be the final four.

            "comment": "My thoughts on all players after Episodes 7 and 8:\n\n* OG Jungle Team - &gt;!I hope they stay together until the final four. I don't see anything splitting them up unless there's a Money Challenge that's actually individual play and not team play. !&lt;\n* Dex - &gt;!Its like they tailor-made the DM for him. As soon as they explained what the DM was, I knew he was going to win considering his UDT training. He hasn't shown as much on the main Money Challenge but, why would you need to when you've got HJH and Xitsuh on your team. !&lt;\n* Hyunji - &gt;!She's flashed a bit of strategic thinking here and there, these two episodes. She's been very much, go with the flow with the OG Jungle Team but I'm curious what her individual play will be like. !&lt;\n* HJH - &gt;!Goddamn, he was such a badass in Episode 8. I loved it. He looks so docile and non-threatening when he's not \"on\" and I think it lures people into thinking that he can be beatable. But when he's \"on\" he's the best player in this game, and one of the two best reality game show players of all time - between him and Jang Dong Min, really. The way that he sacrificed for the OG Jungle Team and able to guess right away what Knucks was going to pick. And when the new Jungle team were deciding whether to vote between Dex and HJH, the way that he waltzes in and just tells them to vote for him. Every passing episode makes me more of a Kong-duk. !&lt;\n* Xitsuh - &gt;!He is HJH's #1 fanboy. I don't think I've seen a shot of HJH without Xitsuh since they've come to the mansion. One thing that I do worry about him is his nature to get spun up really quickly about something that doesn't seem right with him - even though he might be wrong. My guess is that HJH and Xitsuh will go very far, but I get the feeling that HJH will use Xitsuh's nature in getting spun up very quickly to his advantage. !&lt;\n* Mina - &gt;!Might be the most frustrating player that I've ever seen. She has smarts and good individual play capability, but her timid nature and misplaced sense of trust and camaraderie completely frustrated me this episode. In that situation, how do you team up with Jin Hyeong again and put any trust into Seung Jin and Knucks considering they just voted you out. And then to pick Dex and Hyunji for DM. Jesus Christ. Selfless to the point where it becomes a hindrance on game play. !&lt;\n* Jin Hyeong - &gt;!Completely the opposite of Mina. Individualistic and selfish to the opposite end of the spectrum. I think I'm coming to a better realization of who he is - it's not just that he fails at these games and challenges because he's only book smart, but rather he's so nakedly selfish and individualistic that his gameplay gets read very easily. Case in point - when him and Pi were making a deal with the OG Jungle team on voting for HJH I laughed when he said that they should ask for $20K each. Dumbass, why would they pay $40K to pay you two off, when they can just buy another voting ticket for the same price? He has no idea how to read other people's position and is so nakedly selfish that it comes back to bite him in the ass. !&lt;\n* Pi - &gt;!I honestly don't know what she adds or brings to the table besides another head count!&lt;\n* Ha Seung Jin - &gt;!He calls it playing a spy, but it wasn't very effective. He doesn't bring much to the table in terms of game play, so he has to resort to double dipping his way through the games. He's definitely the weakes player left now. !&lt;\n* Knucks - &gt;!Paper tiger - strong to the weak and weak to the strong. I'm glad he's off now, I was getting tired of his posturing on the interviews and then immediately doing something completely different on camera. I hope it's a gimmick because if he's actually like this in real life, then I'd imagine he get exposed very soon. The comment about him breaking HJH's other leg was just unnecessary posturing. There's other ways to display confidence/cockiness without saying something like that. Also noticed how he doesn't use honorifics if the people aren't around - calling HJH \"Jin Ho\" instead of \"Jin Ho Hyung\" like when he does when HJH is around. !&lt;\n* YunB - &gt;!The true snake of the series. At least he's keeping it interesting. Also doesn't know how to read very well and/or is overconfident in his ability to convince people - I don't know why he thought he could convince Dex and Hyunji. I also thought it was hilarious the fact that he thought Hyunji declining his offer to target Xitsuh as a betrayal - ha! Just pure projection and gaslighting. !&lt;\n\nAlso - getting some predictions in here:\n\n1. &gt;!Hong Jin Ho!&lt;\n2. &gt;!Xitsuh!&lt;\n3. &gt;!Hyunji!&lt;\n4. &gt;!Dex!&lt;\n5. &gt;!Pi!&lt;\n6. &gt;!YunB!&lt;\n7. &gt;!Edit: Jin Hyeong (I forgot about him, ha)!&lt;\n8. &gt;!Ha Seung Jin!&lt;",

But yea both of them get riled up easily. They kinda make me miss the cool headed Komong, he was the best contender for Jinho.",

Buying another voting ticket for the same price only gets you 1 extra vote so it still would've been a bargain.

At the beginning of the episode she was crying and thinking about getting back at those who put her in the dungeon but in the end when it was time to choose an opponent she said that she wanted to avoid choosing those who she \u201cspent time in the jungle with\u201d\u2026.WHY?? They sent you to a death match not once but TWICE both for essentially no reason AND the pool alliance iced you out of the Money Game. So why not try and get some revenge. I also didn\u2019t like how cocky she was after choosing her opponents (just to end up looking by the way)!&lt; \n\nAnyways, I love indoor team so much. Their unbreakable trust and loyalty makes this show a very fun watch especially because they are the ones I\u2019m rooting for. I love seeing them transfer their money when they are about to go to a death match to each other as well. This team all around are just so damn likeable. \n\nYunB was very stupid in the way he was openly working with his second alliance. Why would you tell the Pool Alliance about the plan you just told the indoor team alliance like 5 seconds ago right in front of them? And then to try to make them make you win the game?? YunB has this air of arrogance to him that I\u2019m not a fan of. Do you think they\u2019re stupid?? Why would they make you first place? Especially when you obviously have another alliance that you\u2019re apart of. I\u2019m glad the indoor team immediately picked up on it and &gt;!threw YunB to the side in the next game!&lt; . It made my heart smile lol. \n\nXitsuh has actually risen in my ranks and became one of my absolute faves lol. The way throughout the game he was essentially accusing the Pool Alliance of being traitors made me giggle I\u2019m not gonna lie. It was even more endearing how he got mad at them and it wasn\u2019t about his points but about Dex\u2019s and said that they were essentially trying to cheat Dex out of his points. Shows just how much he rides for his team. In the beginning I thought that Xitshu would be on the same timing as YunB when it comes to betrayal but instead he\u2019s a very loyal person. Indoor team are the ppl he\u2019s made up his mind about sticking with and he\u2019s going just that (thanks Jimin for giving this unexpectedly useful and loyal player to the indoor team).  \n\nHaving no preview makes me nervous I want a glimpse of next episode so badddd.",

I don't know if they're just sick at it or a huge time was passing on the clock but I had to pause for minutes at a time to find them. I think honestly if I had to play this game on a repeat setting knowing it in advance, my strat would be to immediately draw the entire maze, then draw the shape I'm trying to find and rip around it then superimpose it all over the board. I would be useless trying to eyeball this huge board &lt;!\n\nalso\n\n&gt;! what a based choice by xitsuh. his outfit and glasses and \"RULER\" overlay at the end gave me young kim jong il vibes too on an unrelated note lol &lt;!",

Yep, this person here has no spatial awareness at all. \n\nAlso agree that Mina is actually a bit better than Dex in this game but as I mentioned in other comments, she tends to make many minor mistakes which this time cause her the game.",

There is complete trust in him (and deservedly) and then there is Dex, with whom he would not want to pick a fight\n**********************\n\nDo people realize this is the 1st time Jinho is getting to lead and be a proper leader to a team on gameshow... this is a first for him",

The other side obviously didnt consider her part of the group/valuable. Her best bet would have probably been trying to make a deal with the Dex team and maybe even try to join them by convincing them that she is alone/the other groups is her enemy and maybe offering herself as some kind of spy. Instead she goes after the big alliance on her own (atleast choosing the 2 weakest players I guess) and even if she would have won she would be in a bad position.",

Love the phantom players' concept as it means to 'haunt' the single exiled player. Cant wait to see what Yurisa want to say to YunB lol. But still, kinda questionable as Kerrigan May didn't make an appearance, seems like they sent her back to Korea. So now, I am assuming all eliminated players are on standby until the Final, and consecutively become a phantom player to play against the exiled player in the midnight.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The games are now very punishing; you must win to be safe, either to avoid death matches or being an exiled player. Being a member in a good alliance is a good assurance, as they are quite loyal to each other; but that doesn't work on Jinhyeong and Pi, which are now in the worst positions, and they could be the next sacrifice if the Pool Alliance is not considered as a threat later on.!&lt;",

If they were willing to take more risks they could've countered. \n\nKnucks couldn't win a 2 vs 1 situation but they could've countered by doing a 2 vs 3 in 2nd round to secure points for Knucks. Jinho's plan worked on isolating Knucks but his team didn't help him and even planned on him failing. \n\nThen Knucks picked Jinho in the DM where he'd definitely lose instead of beating a weaker member and maintaining a 5 vs 3 advantage in the next MC. Ideally they would force Jinho vs Xitsuh or Jin Hyeong to take him out but his ego cost him.\n\nSad to see Mina go but she made too many mistakes and honestly was probably having a crap time there. Pi should've realised earlier that the Pool alliance would kick her out when they didn't need her anymore.

Every one of his opponents have also said so, from Kim Gura to the players at Time Hotel, they agreed that when Jinho is good he's good and he's bad when he's bad. \n\nHis forte are games where strategy, tactic, and outside of the box solution can actually be applied. In a certain answer and grinding (be it puzzle, arithmethical, so on) games he's just okay and at political games he's weak. It just so happens most of these game shows showcase the later type of games since they're easier to design. \n\nHe's never lost his touch, his touch only works on certain types of games.",

Surprised how a so far gentle, whiny Mina who always complained about ppl looking down on her acted cocky towards Dex and Hyunji with that provok-ish laugh and taunting after choosing them. I\u2019d be mad too if someone acted like that after choosing me for DM esp after her own original team deserted her and left her n others on their own. Not to mention the over confidence that flowed even during the match which was so diff from her demeanour so far. She could have left with her self respect restored n new fans after giving the burns to her actual betrayers but she chose to go back to square one after all the crying. She\u2019d have looked super cool too that way. Sorry that I may be over reading things here but it was diff from her usual character so I felt the c vibes. It\u2019s annoying when victims do the same things they complain ppl do to them.\n\nNot a fan of Knucks coz his group embodies toxic masculinity but I wish he stuck around longer as he had an honest side to him and def a good player who passionately played the game. A befitting send off tho with both team leaders clashing. Seeing Jinho getting angry n worked up to defend his team was endearing. Xitsuh surprises me more and more with what he brings to the table each episode but he\u2019s a clear cut enemy target for the other team. Hyunji should be more confident about her skills. She and Dex will also continue to be prime targets for death matches for the other team. Not surprised with what YunB did as I always felt he\u2019d be the odd one out from the old jungle team. HSJ preaches about loyalty a lot but he\u2019s consistently playing from two sides almost every game lol he\u2019s a pretty redundant player at this point with Knucks gone. I expect next episode to be full of twists again as one team is strong and the other scattered. The show has so far been quite unpredictable with the twists so we can expect some new interesting changes next episodes to break up the alliance maybw",

That kind of acting is deserved for someone who betrayed her. And ya, I don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t occur to her or Pi to try and align with the og jungle team esp considering they were sidelined by their teams. I would say JinHyeong played his master stroke here. Neither teams trusted him, the og jungle team would have reciprocated Pi and Mina but JinHyeong very cleverly spun the situation and put it forward to Pi saying they (og team) would never team up with them when it was him who was being avoided. I kinda wanna see Pi being a badass making her own decisions instead of following whatever the boys tell her n getting last priority treatment in return for her support",

And i think the main reason is that she trusted HSJ too much, she couldn't leave the Indoor team completely even though she was not in the pool alliance, and she needed one for her own so the only choice was Jin Hyeong.",

That not how it works! You can't just decree how people have to play -- you need to provide a game where individualistic play is actually feasible instead of exercise in majority bullying today's game turned out to be.\n\nOtherwise Real Time is a fun variation of Fruit Stand/Fish Shop from The Genius with time element but using coins to rewind time actively makes the game worse. Not declaring exact rules for getting in the line is also stupid, if not for social norms -- technically nothing was preventing big team to just cut in line.\n\nMina was pretty fun this episode, i liked the title of the [preview for this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JluMJsXpJhw) where Mina went through her usual rollercoaster of emotions first getting a chicken and smiling but then getting sad for being abandoned. I wished she played better, but i don't think it mattered in main match since big team was determined to make her of Pi last.\n\nDeathmatch candidates choice was kinda baffling -- why stay loyal to team who continually ostracizes you?\n\nDeathmatch game itself was pretty fun. Unlike big social game that you can't really recreate at home, these these puzzle-type game can be played as you're watching the episode and it was fun finding solutions. Once again Mina made way too mistakes. But i really liked her streak, and i really hope it makes her believe in herself more. Dex did pretty well, but i suspect any other brainy player would crack that game open.\n\nPhantom player twist: man, that player is like a bad habit of Bloody Game, can't drop &gt;!her!&lt;. I suspect producers simply ran out of singleplayer games in casino and decided to reuse 2-player game with &gt;!Jimin!&lt; who was probably still chilling at nearby beach.\n\nAlso not sure what Phantom player is getting out of this, just an appearance fee, i am guessing.\n\nEp 8\n\nThe jungle effect really works on everyone! Even Jinhyung who got the massive loser edit recently became so much more sympathetic after his night struggles sleeping on casino table and having to walk up to mansion under tropical rain and freezing. He also got more humbled by this ordeal it also feels like. I am glad Jinhyung got at least got 1 win in the casino.\n\nSeungjin is once again doing that spy thing. Of all people, his play is actually the closest to S1 Jimin -- he is constantly playing both sides claiming to be useful to both.\n\nI wished they played Black &amp; White on previous day -- but having an odd number of player is crucial for this game -- in that way it's similar to 1-2-3 Game from The Genius . Just like in 1-2-3, pairing up and doing a safe strategy of getting safe 1.5 points each round guarantees you not losing but also won't allow you to win. Jungle boys having 3 members with Nucks becoming the odd one out sealed his loss.\n\nI am glad Pi and JinHyung found some way to make some cash out of Jinho's alliance. JinHyung will especially gonna need it in the jungle. Hopefully he gets that anti-mosquito suit at least.\n\nFor the deathmatch game i wonder what happens if they mode the tile piece on it and it falls off the board. Similarly -- can one move a tile with the target get it off the board and then place it where you want?\n\n&gt;!Nucks!&lt; was one of the better ones among dudebros, but if you come at the king you better not miss.\n\nThe cat and the kitten continue their shenanigans in the background all throughout these episodes. Clearly, they're being edited for the final win.\n\nI was laughing so hard at super intense dramatic phantom player entrance! And that makeup!",

She's clearly very smart (won 2 DM games already), but she's constantly stressed from being picked for elimination since Day 1, physically isolated from the others, deprived of food and water, and didn't have to opportunity to take care of her basic hygiene needs. Honestly she's had to cope with worse than she deserved and this probably broke her in the end. Mina isn't really cut out for these games in the first place, because rather than take \"bloody\" revenge she still chose not to betray those she partnered up with... sometimes I wonder if Mina had been chosen for the Outside team instead of Hyunji she could've gone a lot further, because she has a lot of loyalty and would have fit in well as a team player.\n\nPi could be the Park Jimin of this season. If she hadn't said anything, YunB's team could have possibly won. She didn't go so far as to betray the team, but her tossing the clue was definitely the hint that Xitsuh and Jinho needed to figure out the other team's strategy. I can already feel it - she's going to pull a Judas at some point.\n\nAt first, I was worried about sending YunB off to the jungle, because he could earn an elimination exemption. Junhyung already has one, so if the other team gets one more, Jinho might have to pick two of his teammates for a Death Math...  But there's no way YunB's going to beat Yurisa 1-on-1. He's more of a social player.\n\nSide note: why does Dex always have a loveline when he goes out on a show? I rolled my eyes when Dex said he's going to the Death Match to protect Hyunji, because I can already see where this is going. I was secretly hoping that in the second Main Match, Jinho's team would rotate their partners, but no - Dex &amp; Hyunji - it's too late now...",

But I think that was an asshole move on Mina's part to pick him and hyunji. It would be understandable if she had close relationship with the OG mansion team since the start but every single one of them sent her to the deathmatch twice. I don't know what's going on inside her head, maybe being in the deathmatch 3x messed her brain up. Such a pity to see another one of my fave go home.\n\n* Jimin!! Haha she really looks bitter, and it's very ironic that she's playing the game that got her eliminated lol. What's up with that editing though, they made her look like some kdrama seductress. They made the winner too obvious though. If the eliminated players can still reappear like this then i'm hoping to see Yurisa play against someone next. They may not win but they can at least prevent people from getting vote exemption specially if it's someone they dislike\n\n* JH vs Knucks gave me a slight heart attack when knucks' targets aligned too close with each other but alas this game is right up Kong's alley so that was a satisfying win. Bit sad that knucks was the one eliminated cause he is the most \"likeable\" in the opposition, but in the end he is a victim of YunB's greed. Shouldn't have played solo and played with sejeung instead and let YunB solo.\n\n* Moral of the story, a loyal team that sticks together will always be better than a team made of greedy traitors and backstabbers.\n\n* I'm enjoying Xitsuh's road from the first villain to one of the most badass players. \n\n* Fuck Yeah Yurisa vs YunB haha. YunBi is basically this season's version of Jimin so even though I'm not rooting for him i also don't particularly hate him. This match is gonna be good. \n\n*  Guess it's the order of getting eliminated so next up would be poker guy.",

Sure, if you actually won, you would eliminate the head of their team, but your chances are slim!&lt;\n\n&gt;!If you took the two weaker players of the team to the deathmatch, you would, first and foremost, stand a much higher chance of staying in the competition. Second, you would demoralise them by making them realise that if they stay loyal to jinho, even if they win they will both run a gauntlet of deathmatches every week, and if you knocked one of them off it might break up the whole alliance if they know teaming up with jinho just puts a target on their back. Put everyone else in front of jinho as your meatshields first or hope for an instant elimination game. Now that team is ruined!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Yurisa makes a perfect phantom, props to the makeup department. That is the last person you want to see in this format!&lt;\n\nwell edited episodes, fun. I am starting to think though that &gt;!the jinho alliance has become too strong now, and much as I love them I would like to see things get shaken up. however.. yunb is the only one on the other team I still like anymore, I would've much preferred if Sungjoo/Knucks/Mina were around, or even Jimin if they managed to stir the pot and turn them against each other as the late game advanced. As it seems, unless they suddenly throw a physical game into the mix, jinho is well placed to sweep at this point!&lt;",

I think if other games, she might win but that navigation game seems like too much of a advantage to Dex. Not sure if the PD rigged the games to make sure Dex got higher chance of surviving. And i guessed correctly, its really those eliminated players as Phantom NPCs. Ruthless PD using eliminated players to play the game that got them eliminated and try to stop the players from winning vote exemption voucher. Thats like killing them twice.. Losing the same game twice (Jimin) but at least we get to see those eliminated players again with their rage... Yurisa appearance with that makeup is sick... I honestly think she is a bit on the psychopath side... Hope shes just acting.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEp 8\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;!After this 2 episode of team games. Im pretty sure the last 4 will be Jinho Team because they just owned them in any games and deathmatches despite they have lesser team members. The other team should have just worked tgt with JinHyeong Pi and Mina to eliminated Jinho n mates... Now that its 4v4. Pretty sure Jinho team will win any team games. This tight bond/alliance reminds me of Time hotel (top 3 alliance). Its too strong with Dex helping HyunJi in deathmatch and Jinho helping Xitsuh in deathmatch too. Its like the loyalty is at the max now. No way to break them up. YunB too naive to think he can just break it apart but threatening them... Really dumb tactic.. The remaining should have teamed up and try to win but they fought among themselves and let Jinho n team keep taking the lead. Now thats the headcount is so balanced, i think Jinho team will probably eliminated the other team 1 by 1 until last 4 then they will probably fight among themselves in the finals. Last finals was top 4 so its really just nice.!&lt;\n\nThe time clock game is interesting but the Black/White/Gray game is a little boring since after the first round, the results are very predictable... And&gt;! LMAO the pool alliance broke up so easily... They got weird playing style. With YunB keep trying to take the lead and convince everyone to let him win and HSJ keep trying to play SPY mode which usually backfired sooner or later..!&lt;",

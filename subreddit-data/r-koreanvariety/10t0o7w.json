Confirming he is indeed same guy. (Nothing came out of it as far as I can find, and there have been more focus on discovering what other manipulations they did last year, he is more or less proven to be accused of thing he actually did.)\n\n&gt; https://twitter.com/kooceo/status/260175990779682816\n\n&gt; Blog post telling what kind of political controversy he made. Basically making fake news and spamming them.\n\n&gt; http://blog.yes24.com/blog/blogMain.aspx?blogid=djhgs&amp;artSeqNo=7674155\n\n&gt; and screenshot of same Twitter he used with same Twitter account as Brand Ranking Twitter,\n\n&gt; http://cfile25.uf.tistory.com/image/1574F34950886A290C40D0\n\nJust the fact that websites such as koreaboo and soompi and a bunch of fan accounts and teenagers on Twitter who ship real life people are the only ones who think these things mean anything and take them seriously should be enough to take them with a grain of salt. \n\nno doubt about the likes of YJS and KJK's popularity, just don't base it on BS like this. \u263a\ufe0f\n\nHere's someone highlighting how easy/common it is to \"cheat\" to get someone on the list if they have a dedicated enough fanbase: \n\n&gt; On a fanbase twt acc I ran for a BTS member I had people spamming my DMs begging me to post reminders to like / comment / recommend naver articles. There are people who make accounts to list newest articles for specific idols so fans can interact with them and raise the \u2018community\u2019 points for said idol. There are also people who waste hours everyday creating naver blogs to post articles with pictures of their faves with tags. But I don\u2019t think these simple actions are enough to manipulate all criterias for the ranking.",

Trust me, nobody cares about this except maybe kids on Twitter or perhaps those same people who do in fact manipulate the results because they have nothing else to show for and need these things to \"prove\" their idols are popular or maybe low quality publications that want clicks on their articles. In fact, this is banned on the r/kpop subreddit, for the reasons those quoted text already laid out perfectly with evidence to back them up. At some point, you have to stand up to this fakenews and not give them any more power, don't you agree? This sub should follow suite and ban such content as well. It doesn't help anyone and is sometimes even harmful. \n\nSomeone said it doesn't make sense, I gave them information about why it doesn't. Are you sure YOU'RE not the one who is triggered here, thinking if this random list based on nothing is invalid that your favorite truly has nothing else to show for, maybe? (I'm guessing here. I don't know why you'd be triggered. It doesn't make sense to me that someone would be triggered by the truth. You brought up SJH, I didn't even check this list, so I assume she is on it based on what you said.) why else would someone want to make it personal when another person calls out manipulative media? You must somehow benefit from this, otherwise, there is no point having an issue with my comment. \n\nAs far as I see, JSM has won multiple awards, has the third heighest screentime of any woman on SBS with just 1 show, has done multiple variety shows, has been praised by industry giants, and a lot more. In fact, there was a thread on this very sub asking who is the best female variety star and pretty much every single answer was JSM and PNR. Seems to me that she doesn't need to be on made-up lists based on no metrics set up by sketchy people. \u263a\ufe0f Maybe that's why you're triggered here? Do you need such lists to exist to argue someone's popularity or value, maybe? Cause I really don't. \ud83d\ude01",

I happen to think it's a worthwhile effort to seek the truth and shut down media that is baseless, manipulated and false. A waste of energy and time would be going through people's comments on read to talk about something unrelated to the topic at hand. \n\n- \"why don't you let the kids have their fun\": It might look like child's play to you, but that's exactly when and how it starts. I'm a firm believer that anything can contribute to the existence of the likes of those conspiracy theorists out there. You might think \"oh wow, look at this dude on a small random subreddit trying to change the world! What a loser! Thinks any of this matters!\" The list doesn't matter, but it's existence does. I'm just trying to contribute to the change as much as I can, even if it's just about a random Korean entertainment ranking list. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  I'm sorry you feel that I'm raining on your parade, but sometimes it's best to not parade around such things made by people whose entire job and legacy was manipulating the truth for political agenda and power. The likes of YJS and KJK really don't need such lists. YJS has 19 grand awards, is know as the national MC, is one of the most loved and popular Korean celebrities based on public's perception of him, commercials and shows he does, his name carrying weight, his legacy of front-manning more than a couple Legendary variety shows (IC, Family Outing, RM, XMen), and a lot more. It's not like the list is far from the truth. He IS the top. I'm simply saying, there are better ways to reach this conclusion than relying on \"brand ranking\", when it is literally based on nothing but made-up metrics by a sketchy designer who is known for social media manipulation. \n\n- something to brag about? Of course it is. Variety shows work very simply: The funnier and more entertaining you are, the better you are, the more screentime you get. The only ridiculous thing about that award is that they summed the hours. They simply wanted to give the people who had multiple shows on SBS some award but not the grand award. However, if you actually bother to read what I wrote, I specifically emphasized the part you casually glossed over : That she was the 3rd heighest with just 1 show. This wasn't an accumulation of several shows put together, but only one. So, let's walk you through it this time backwards: the more screentime you get, the better you are which means you're funnier and more entertaining that others. \n\nSo yes. I do think it's important that a variety star is funny and entertaining, and that if they are acknowledged for it by the Industry that means it's an achievement and worth bragging about as a fan. The only embarasssing thing is that you don't even know that's what's important in variety, apparently.",

But as soon as anyone says the slightest thing about JSM, you suddenly jump in to preach. And the first thing you do is try to frame people as a hater. Newsflash, I don\u2019t hate JSM. I\u2019m not even a huge fan of SJH. I\u2019m simply calling out that account for the way they behave. \n\nMy \u201cshade\u201d was only a response to that account implying that SJH fans need this list to brag about her popularity. But of course, you don\u2019t care if a JSM fan is being rude to SJH and her fans. Keep your nose out of a conversation if you\u2019re going to be this biased.",

It's not even the first time I've talked about this on Reddit. You must be so insecure to read so much into something that has nothing to do with SJH. You're the one who brought her up. I didn't even know she was on the list. The banner of this article only has 2 RM members, and I definitely don't think I was shading YJS by listing all the ways he is the best variety personality ever. But you do you, I guess.",

I really loved this concept back in S3E1 and I'm super glad Jung PD is expanding on it. This ep was quite an emotional one, watching them paint the \ud0dc\uadf9\uae30 and singing the \uc560\uad6d\uac00 brought tears to my eyes... :(!&lt;\n\n&gt;!On a side note, they were honestly pretty loud and noisy for people who were supposedly on the run, lol. And Ha Seokjin's random 5s cameo appearance as Clover was such a pleasant surprise!!&lt;",

The escapes were planned out well and I personally think they upped the difficulty quite a lot despite the escapees being a lot wiser this time round. I do feel there were one or two bit that felt a little out of place here and there in terms of the show but nothing note worthy. Glad to know they'll be coming back for another season. Also can't wait for the subs for the special.  \n\n\nThank you for all your hard work!    \n\uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4",

Crime Scene is one of my favourite Korean shows and I'd love a season 4. Was wondering if there was a Korean news site or rumour site or something like that, that might raise some light on whether or not a season 4 will be a thing as I've noticed it got great ratings when it aired. I felt the same way about 'The Genius' too but that's clearly not happening :P",

I love how she cried because she wanted to also say goodbye to the mermaid lady and told her to stay healthy. She's a 5 year old with a big heart.I have to give credit to byul and haha for raising their children well.",

To be IN LOVE with somebody is only used in a romantic regard in North America. \n\nYou can love your kids, you're never in love with them. You can love your partner, and be in love with them. \n\nI read the title and thought it was odd, but I just assumed it was somebody from outside of North America. This forum has a lot of fantastic people from all over the world, it not uncommon to see things said in a way you would never see in North America.",

She seems to have a YouTube and he appears to be around for it. I'm unsure the status of HExGN and TIxHN. I believe GN has some photos of HE up but nothing recent so who knows?\n\nI saw HE was on BamBams YouTube channel for a few episodes so I'm about to check those out.",

They obviously had an attraction there but, of the  final couples, they had the shallowest connection. They just seemed too different of people that the real world would get in the way. Both of them were great though so I hope they have future success.",

I don't remember if they really did try dating or if it was just for the cameras. I know they were a very well loved couple on WGM but in that other show SIY went off and got mad about something and Crown J was left feeling embarrassed by her reaction and SIY told the crew to stop filming and she got criticized for it and the show ended. Maybe if Hyungdon was part of that, things would've been different.",

She had a HUGE meltdown and people were really mad at her for  not only for that but it was also Crown J second chance back in the variety industry, her meltdown messed his come back.",

                            "comment": "Yes. It was also a bit confusing because I think Crown J actually wanted to try dating SIY in real life and I think SIY felt the same way that is why they agreed to do that new show. Unfortunately after SIY's meltdown, I think they don't even have a friendship anymore. That moment ruined it for the both of them. They both stopped contacting each other and ended their friendship after that moment which is pretty sad since they remained friends since WGM days often hanging outside of filming and even kept in touch after the show.",

He seemed very understanding of her BUT I don't think she felt like she did anything wrong until the news got out what she did. She decatived her IG and created a new one. All the variety shows she was on got canceled. As for her and Crown J actually having feeling for each other then I don't really know it that was not also I don't know if they are still friends or not",

Obviously i don't see it happening nowadays but if they made their own spinoff back during the WGM days i think it wouldve been great cause those episodes of them living together were hilarious.",

It sucks what happened with Crown J and Seo In Young's other show but I won't pretend to know all the details on what might've happened so I wouldn't judge her strictly based off that incident.",

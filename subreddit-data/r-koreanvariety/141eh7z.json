    "postText": "I have been watching The Gentlemen's League all weekend on Netflix since I enjoy it so much. I think I'm even obsessed with the show, as a sports fan myself. The Namhae episode keeps on popping up everytime, as the members keep on mentioning it, and I grow curious and curious about it. I've been googling the specific episode of the Namhae episode, however the fandom is not that big unlike Running Man who has dedicated fans who create blogs about the specific episodes. Help this girl out. I need to know which episode is the Namhae and whether it's a season 1 or season 2 episode. It's harder to watch variety shows in Netflix, I guess.",

Cuz they only referenced the Namhae ep after the Namhae ep happened.\n\nI'd suggest that you watch in order because there are other stuff that gets referenced (like own goals / funny situations / LDG vs AJH)",

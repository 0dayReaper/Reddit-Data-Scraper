            "comment": "Hmm, as a born-and-raised Filipino/Asian, it's been like two decades or so since I've eaten bugs. \n\nBack when I was a kid I'd climb the palms trees barehanded to see the birds' nests and sometimes get a coconut or so. Meanwhile other folks would be with the base, roots of the palm and digging for the huge juicy white beetle larvae. \n\nDon't remember if I ever ate those white coconut grubs but I must've, especially raw, since I remember holding them in my hands, lol. Over the years back then I've definitely seen them cooked on gas-powered stoves though but ya I don't recall actually eating them. \n\nSome of my neighbors/friends/classmates/etc. were squatters/informal settlers and so for some of them it's actually a necessity to eat those bugs when they had no food. I've been privileged enough to not go through such things for actual sustenance. Even though I am in poverty to this day, there are still those that have it way worse, and it's hard to understand the world.\n\nIn the context of climate change and other stuff (lol, they even reference Snowpiercer in UMA Game), I'm open to for sure trying crickets, mealworms, grasshoppers, Dubia roaches, or whatever it is that they're trying to market for protein instead of the destructive grazing or feeding for beef/pork/etc. Of course, this is all virtue signaling for most people but again as somebody that has for sure eaten insects (fml don't even know what they were, probably just some roasted mealworms or blended insect powder or something) when I was younger, it's not as daunting for me. Maybe.\n\nPreferably though, I'd rather eat synthetic/cultured/lab-grown/etc. meat so that no industrial farming is taking place. People forget insects are still alive, same with the plants, everything. Lol. I keep forgetting to add beans and lentils and so on to my diet despite trying to /r/EatCheapAndHealthy. Even though vegetables for protein are sorta bland unless you do special seasoning and so on, at least they're more affordable.\n\nPhew, now that that random insect backstory is out, wtf I expected the episode to be longer and for them to maybe do something more with the insects, lmao.",

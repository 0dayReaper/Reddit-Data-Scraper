    "postText": "I\u2019m just getting caught up on variety shows and there have been some new additions to Master in the House and 2D1N. \n\n\nI\u2019m still iffy about the additions on master in the house. Bambam and Daeho seem to be filling roles similar to Doyoung and Donghyun. And there isn\u2019t anyone to play leader until Seungi (hopefully) comes back. They both seem nice and I think bambam is hilarious but I\u2019m just not sure what they\u2019re bringing to the show that wasn\u2019t there.\n\n2D1N on the other hand did a beautiful job casting in my opinion. I have not frame of reference for Seonho and was a bit worried when I saw how young he was, but I was pleasantly surprised how quickly he adjusted. Even in just the first trip he settled in so well, had great banter, and played not only an active role, but a proactive one. \n\n\nI\u2019m fairly new to the Korean variety world so I was just wondering what everyone else\u2019s takes were on the cast lineup changes. Also if there are any other historically good or notoriously bad casting additions!",

            "comment": "Historically good? \n\nAdding Jeon SoMin and Yang SeChan to Running Man, 7 years into the show. \n\nThey joined in March 2017. The show first started in 2010. They were both 30 years old (with the exception of Lee KwangSoo who was close to their age, the rest of the cast are much older, with the biggest age gap being 20 years between the oldest member and the new members). So you could say they were fresh young blood, and at least in SoMin's case, completely new to variety. They were taking a massive risk with her, and it paid off tremendously. \n\nSoMin won Best Rookie award and Best couple award her first year. She then won top excellence award next year of two years after. SeChan won top excellence 5 years after in 2021/2. \n\nThe show had very low ratings. Before the two joined, the show was on its last legs. Not just the bad ratings, but so much controversy surrounding the firing of two old members. (Who ended up staying) with the addition of the new members, there was a clear spike in viewership ratings. It also helped that the PD was trying new things.\n\nMany people were not seeing SeChan's contribution as he is/was a comedian and didn't have a solid character and was too similar to the other male members, so he was somewhat struggling at first. They've addressed this on the show several times, so I am not saying this based on personal opinion. It took him several years to finally find his footing. \n\nSoMin on the other hand, I think they struck gold with her. She is a variety genius. She introduced new dynamics to the show, something viewers only saw with guests at times. She was daring and bold, going against the typical Asian girl stereotypes and didn't mind basically throwing her actress image away to get down and dirty with the dudes. Seriously. This girl saved running man. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (in fact, I think both SeChan and SoMin did) \n\nThe members have also expressed this. They even call the two of them their Lucky charms.",

However, after watching the first ep, I found myself looking forward to the second ep. Bambam's straightforward remarks are as hilarious as expected, and I'm looking forward to more Bambam and Doyoung interactions. On the other hand, I wasn't expecting anything from Daeho because I only knew him as a baseball player, not an entertainer, but in the end, his scenes were mostly what I can remember.\n\nI agree with your opinion on **2D1N**'s new member. Honestly, It felt like the show became brighter now that he joined, and I also noticed how Inwoo became more adjusted and relaxed than ever.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if this is an unpopular opinion, but I'm quite uncomfortable with Lee Sangyeob's addition in **Sixth Sense**. I still love Sixth Sense, though. It's just that his \"role\" only works if he's guesting. I remember laughing hard when he guested in S1. His scenes only became unfunny and kinda boring now that he gets teased by all the other members every ep.",

They tried bringing in various guests to see who would fit the remaining original cast but none seemed to blend in well. The show lost its original family feel within the cast and the episodes got less funny and the laughter and comedic scenes felt forced.\n\nThen came Code Kunst, who I felt was the first guest to blend in well with them and got the friendly banter back into the studio. The show felt brighter, the cast got more relaxed and comfortable with one another again and now it feels like they managed to get several other members who fit right in and form a family like cast again who I think are genuinely friendly with one another outside of filming too.",

Also, the existing member itself not really have the \"lead\" trait either. They are kinda the main comedy machine where they need to throw and throw the punchline here and there. \n\nAlthough people can believe what they want, I also believe even when cast member saying that standing in equal footing and there's no leader things, at the end of the day, usually you gonna find up someone who atleast have experience enough to lead the show. I mean, having someone take the leader role means you have the \"anchor\" for the flow of the show itself.\n\nFor every show that I watched, the best one is Jeon Somin for Runningman. She's quickly adapt to the show and chemistry between member and also very flexible as long as she can make things funny. Quickly joining the rank of gambler and betrayal battle, settle in a loveline, going crazy over male guest, setting up monologue, dancing like crazy, etc. I mean, joining a new show is already hard, but joining existing program and quickly seize the spot and attention?",

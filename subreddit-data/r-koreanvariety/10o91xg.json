    "postText": "So I've recently remembered watching a show that had two teams that played games against eachother but the main focus was that one of it was democratic with no leader while the other had a ruler and under circumstances they could switch the teams. It played in a traditional korean house where they had to self provide hence the ruler thing/decision making. I think i watched it on youtube around 2016-2018. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME! \n\nI would love to watch it or know if it has been cancelled because it was so interesting as a concept?",

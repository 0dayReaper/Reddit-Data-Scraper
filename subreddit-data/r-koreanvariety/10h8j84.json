            "comment": "One of the new dating shows will also be on Netflix, it's called **Nineteen to Twenty (\uc5f4\uc544\ud649\uc2a4\ubb3c)** or 19/20, check these threads for more info: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/102skks/nineteen_to_twenty_1920_a_new_netflix_youth/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/102r1di/nineteen_to_twenty_korean_version_of/\n\nThat show is about high school students graduating or something like that, so it'll be lighter and less intense, probably.\n\nThere's also **Romance Before Debut (\u30ed\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306f\u3001\u30c7\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u524d\u306b\u3002)**, where somehow they're making Kpop/Jpop idols date each other before debuting in the entertainment industry, lmao. They might set up spicy stuff there to make it more tense but ya usually it's just light chill romance. \n\nRomance Before Debut is from the Japanese streaming service called ABEMA though, so probably no English subs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e257KzHjb4 and https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/109jq5z/the_dating_reality_show_romance_before_debut/\n\nThere was also Heart Signal Japan from ABEMA but nobody has picked it up yet, so no English subs and you'll have to use OCR/machine translation and such. This is Heart Signal Japan from the ABEMA Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2DWOkvRPRQ\n\n---\n\nRecently Japan also had **Koi No Last Vacation (\u604b\u306eLast Vacation, Love\u2019s Last Vacation)** and **Shuffle Island (\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30d5\u30eb\u30a2\u30a4\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9)**, but they have no English subs.\n\nKoi No Last Vacation, from Paravi channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KJFw0S4LZ4\n\nShuffle Island (this has a few seasons now), from ABEMA channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsxjM2uB8S4\n\nMaybe CostcoSubs (they subbed the original first season of Terrace House: Boys x Girls Next Door, Another Terrace (extra scenes from the official Youtube channel of Terrace House), et cetera) or some other fansub group will pick them up in the future.\n\nSometimes wish Japanese translators/subbers/etc. are active on Patreon or something, well they might be as I'm just out of touch nowadays. But yes, for Korean stuff, these days I've seen people post Patreon/etc. links to fund certain dating shows or variety show content.\n\n---\n\nAnd ya iheartu2 is subbing **Sleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774)** and **Chain Reaction (\uccb4\uc778\ub9ac\uc561\uc158)**, check iheartu2's Twitter or Youtube. \n\niheartu2 also posts some news about upcoming Chinese/Korean/etc. dating shows, just be careful since they also post spoilers about the couples/pairings/ships/etc. lol. Like there's a lot of spoiled Chinese dating show couples (so much nostalgia/etc. since some of them lasted for several months or now years) and so if you just watch Korean dating shows it's fine.\n\nSleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774), was so ridiculous and hilarious. You'll probably be howling with the panelists, from laughter and shock, like rofl.\n\nIn Sleeping Only Relationship there's hysterical af scenes due to some cast members, like it's actually crazy how unexpectedly funny the show was. It starts off with gloomy rainy weather but ya imagine if they had better filming conditions and production, it would've been maybe way better.\n\nSleeping Only Relationship doesn't have an official English sub. But it does have a fan sub from iheartu2. There's actually also machine-translated subs right now for the rest of Sleeping Only Relationship and Chain Reaction but they often skip dialogue.\n\n---\n\nSome people from Netflix or other streaming services dating shows these days were actually from ZAMSTER/LookGating/etc. channels on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtDcEbupijR_gufF7PIEDGQ/videos and https://www.youtube.com/@lookgating/videos\n\nLike Single's Inferno Season 2's Hanbin is really funny sometimes on the ZAMSTER/LookGating videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPhBXNyXtCg&amp;t=42s.\n\nThe girl in that LookGating video with Hanbin is ChuJeong/\uce04\uc815, she's in a new Korean dating show right now called **Love Alarm: Clap! Clap! Clap! (\uc88b\uc544\ud558\uba74 \uc6b8\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9dd!\uc9dd!\uc9dd!)**. It's based off a Korean webtoon, there's actually a Kdrama (from 3 or so years ago) of the webtoon on Netflix.\n\nAnother guy from LookGating, Jeonghoon, is also in a different and new dating show called **Company/Office Romance (\uc0ac\ub0b4\uc5f0\uc560)**.\n\n---\n\nThere's also the dating shows made for Youtube now.\n\nFor dating shows on Youtube that have Koreans and international people, there's also **Ramyun &amp; Chill (from DKDKTV channel), Episode 1 and playlist**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-QbAbV_8NI&amp;list=PLq0bxUK0D1KZp83qLQRKGvlVPIsUOdxjR)\n\nAnd also **3&amp;More (from Blimey \ube14\ub77c\uc774\ubbf8 channel), Season 4, Episode 1 and playlist**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8M1LEZ485w&amp;list=PLyfSAn8BP3bA2daCAa9G2TzeLSsDbtYRo), etc.\n\n---\n\nThere's Malaysian/Singaporean/etc. dating shows now too on Youtube: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yyjiu2/love_catcher_in_bali_e01_221118/iwvbxrm/\n\n**Play Safe Play Me** (from the Leeroy Wong channel), it was marketed/titled as a Malaysian version of Single's Inferno but it's actually really different and somewhat chill, Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt665qFsW3s\n\n**Dui Ni You Gan Jue (\u5bf9\u4f60\u6709\u611f\u89c9)** from the GOXUAN \u591f\u70ab channel, Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nJGrANrE5Q\n\n**One Week Love** from TheSmartLocal channel. It's a Singaporean dating show, Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxJbOHuGi-E\n\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and more info on where to watch them**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/1076jds/good_dating_shows/j3kxjmx/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zyn2y0/regarding_the_popularity_of_the_different_dating/j2a8bok/\n\n**Compiled list of other East Asian dating shows (this is initially sorta \"scandalous\" dating shows, click through the thread links for more other info)**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/y83ke7/pink_lie_episode_4_discussion_spoilers/j584452/\n\n**Check here for where to watch other dating shows (and East Asian variety shows, Kdramas/Jdoramas/Cdramas/et cetera) with VPN/et cetera, you'll need it for VIU, Disney+, and so on**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zobw4m/where_can_i_watch_variety_shows_here_in_spain/j0m09qv/",

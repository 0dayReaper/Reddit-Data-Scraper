    "postText": "I've been binge watching these type of shows for the past few weeks because we can all agree that 2022 is the year of korean dating shows and some of them are still ongoing. The show is all about bringing your friend of the opposite gender and live in the friend village for 10 days. For those who have waited or didn't watch this show because it wasn't subbed then good news, all episodes now have english subtitles. It has 10 episodes btw. \n\nI was going to discard this dating show because I thought that they would be focusing more on breaking the boundary of friendship between the opposite gender and I find it awkward because I really think that man and woman can still be friends without romantic interest/feelings involved. It was a mistake, and luckily I decided to watch this one and suprisingly it was the time where all the episodes were subbed already.\n\nWhat I like about this show is that its not all about just dating. It provided a new environment or perspective on how friends can help or affect your decisions because in this show you have someone you really know and can trust. \n\nFor those who have finished or are currently watching this show, what are your thoughts on it. How would you rank it on the 2022 korean dating show list",

The additional focus on the friendships was the greatest aspect of the show for me, as it allowed for far more wider, deeper interactions and different viewpoints. It made the overall feel much calmer and comfortable. I was also happy, that the friends were really friends, instead of secret lovers. \n\nThey should rethink the catfishes though. It happened too much and also too late. It destroyed amazing potential developments.",

            "comment": "agree! i just finished watching this and the pure friendship and support between the close male-female friend pairs touched me greatly. even more so than the romantic relationships. because u truly can see how much they hurt when their friend is hurt or how they do their best to help their friend find love or spur their friend in all sorts of ways. also, when they are joking and having fun with each other. pure friendships are really beautiful.\n\ni also think having a platonic and close friend of the other gender really helped them a lot in navigating the romantic lines. it adds a lot of perspective. and u can truly see how important it is to have a close friend to journey with and support u when going thru the complications of romantic relationships \n\nu can watch it with subs in kshow123.tv",

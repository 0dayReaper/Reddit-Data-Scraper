As it's near guaranteed that there'd be at least one dating show from YOUKU/iQIYI/Tencent Video/etc. that will have English subs per Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 of the year. \n\nSo if the Korean dating shows are not making them, check the Youtube channels of the Chinese streaming services, they usually have the subs on Youtube too.\n\nFor **Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81) Season 3**, y'all know Shen Yue from Meteor Garden, A Love So Beautiful, et cetera? She's one of the panelists for Twinkle Love Season 3 now, there's pictures of it on Weibo, check iheartu2's Twitter and so on. Jam Hsiao is also returning (prepare for his crying, haha, he gets so invested and emotional just like us viewers). Season 3 of Twinkle Love might release maybe around this summer or later this 2023.\n\n**Ai No Sato (\u3042\u3044\u306e\u91cc) or Love Village** is coming soon on Netflix this May 2023. **Heart Signal 4 (Korean Version)** is also probably releasing around that time. \n\nOh My Girl Mimi was confirmed as a panelist for Heart Signal 4 recently (https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/12qj8cc/oh_my_girls_mimi_confirmed_to_join_heart_signal_4/), same with Kim Eana, Sangmin, etc. Check the soompi and so on articles about Heart Signal 4, they're finally releasing more info, we should have teasers/trailers/et cetera soon for this upcoming season.\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and Kdramas, East Asian films, et cetera, and more info on where to watch them**: **https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/12ccjku/can_someone_give_me_a_list_of_korean_variety/jf16a56/** and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/12bduuc/new_offbrand_terrace_house_set_to_start_this_may/jewxvfh/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10yej01/singles_inferno_confirmed_to_return_for_season_3/j7zqw31/\n\n---\n\nThere's pretty solid iQIYI dating show right now called Yes, I Do, it's  now got Season 4. It started airing like half a month ago. They got a really nice house/et cetera for this fourth season of Yes, I Do. Some new vibes too.\n\n**Yes, I Do (\u559c\u6b22\u4f60\u6211\u4e5f\u662f4)**, from iQIYI channel, Episode 1, Part 1 and 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqkOGp2dQqw and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEV0hZTWj9c\n\n**Yes, I Do (\u559c\u6b22\u4f60\u6211\u4e5f\u662f4)**, from iQIYI channel, Episode 2, Part 1 and 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fv_6Q3dptY and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZwpM5S3oUg\n\n**Yes, I Do (\u559c\u6b22\u4f60\u6211\u4e5f\u662f4)**, from iQIYI channel, Episode 3, Part 1 and 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVw3Ou1ka6I and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18WA3X0k1Wc\n\n---\n\nOMG, fml, how do I forget about the \"Friends to Maybe Lovers\" show (\u597d\u53cb\u597d\u6709\u611b) that Tencent Video is doing right now. Unfortunately, no English subs, check the Tencent Video or WeTV website though, they might add subs later.\n\nThere's a great visual for **Hao You Hao You Ai (\u597d\u53cb\u597d\u6709\u611b)**, her name is Fu Dongnuan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2tdkMkD6Ok&amp;t=368s\n\n---\n\nKpop idols, Chinese idols, et cetera with Korean/Chinese/Japanese/etc. dating shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/12qj8cc/oh_my_girls_mimi_confirmed_to_join_heart_signal_4/jgqzu8i/",

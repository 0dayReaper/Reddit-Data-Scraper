    "postText": "Hong Jinho have a series called PR22 on Youtube where he (acting as the PR team manager) promotes various stuffs with various Girl Group members (employees/interns). They are lighthearted and quite funny:\n\nFor WCG with Woo!Ah:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHBjeHXUtBq8YAfMcICllgbFX_37oum_K\n\nFor various brands:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNVa7Mf9ObHs7UfSiVO15yHx2-demZokw\n\nThis show was doing well in Korea but Jinho seems to be too busy to keep it up. Thought I might share since they\u2019re eng subbed and a lot of Kong\u2019s old&amp;new international fans are coming out these days and you cannot have too much beans haha.",

A wide shot of the entire room looks so bizarre lol. Like everyone is gathered around a massive table, dressed up in the most absurd attire to partake and make each other laugh.\n\nI wish they'd do more of these types of no laugh events though, its sooo good.",

But it got delayed due to COVID-19 and stuff, so finally they had it this year and I believe they do film this on his actual birthday so it really is a special for his birthday. Last time, it seems like besides YBJ, only one other person dressed up. &gt;!The ballerina woman at the end of this yr's video !&lt;came in a full scuba outfit last time LOL. Last time he also gave everyone gifts including iPads, so I think it's also a highlight that he gives everyone a prize.\n\nIt seems like a mixture of people, some celebs, some personal friends of his, some online influencers, some fans - the reason why I think some of them were fans was because I saw auditions to join as a guest at the party on some channels; but at the same time I saw multiple people who were present for the first one; like &gt;!the woman who played the recorder with her nose. !&lt;From my understanding, he does make a social media post a few weeks before to invite people, they just have to send a video to come under the hashtag Byung-Jae day or something\n\nCompared to 4 years ago, this year they dressed up A LOT more. I recognized some Korean tiktokers who came in as their characters; like the guy wearing the red checkered apron, the guy wearing the blue suit, the guy with the sharpie around his mouth; the guy in the pigeon mask is also acquainted with them. Then there were celebrities/comedians/tv personalities like Kim Jong Min. YBJ's manager was also the host &gt;!who got ejected LOL.!&lt; Even though he's his manager, he's also has fans. I don't recognize most people in attendance, but a lot of them look very familiar; I just haven't watched a regular variety shows in a long time so I'm out of touch!",

It's also a bummer when they choose repeat challenges knowing some of them are bad at it and it feels like the game is about watching them struggle for laughs. Maybe it's just me who isn't enjoying the show as much lately but I'm rooting for the cast and production team.",

HDYP started as an experimental-ish project for Jaesuk for him to do whatever he wants on his off day.\n\nEven their popular projects like SSAK3, Refund Sisters, JMT Company, were never physically demanding to the point where requires athleticism. In the early days, Jaesuk never ran around jumping ropes and all too.\n\nSo I'm not sure how you came up with the conclusion that all(?) variety show require stamina to run for a long time. This isn't Physical 100, Real Men, or early Running Man... As for chemistry, their chemistry is always there. The PD killed it with his boring ideas. I can see them trying to make it funny but it often falls flat.\n\nThat said, they CAN be funny without having to be physical, like the current Running Man. They play games that are catered to the cast's abilities and not do something like forcing Jinjoo, Mijoo, and Junha who are not great at sports, do sports.",

Alone or not, athleticism, stamina or physical strength were never prerequisites for a variety show like HDYP. Or even most variety shows. \n\nAnd of course I know the direction has changed. I was there from the start. I\u2019d say it\u2019s the PD\u2019s poor decision, planning, and conceptualisation that makes these recent episodes not very fun to watch with it\u2019s extremely repetitive content. \n\nLike who would want to watch the same thing for almost 4 weeks straight? It seems like he\u2019s doing it for himself rather than for the viewers.\n\nETA: I know 22Kyung is extremely funny and has no filter on his Lotto Show. But. the concept and everything really killed it. Even the best MC, Jaesuk, or veteran Haha, can barely save the show.",

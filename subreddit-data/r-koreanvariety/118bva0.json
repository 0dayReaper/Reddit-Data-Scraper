    "postText": "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me, but I really do think the latest season of single\u2019s inferno highlighted some of the issues the format of the show has. For example:\n- every single competition is physical based. We don\u2019t get to see the islander\u2019s personalities or talents, and it really does depend on your physical capabilities before you enter the show. Although this is more or less ok for the men (as they all seem to workout), it\u2019s not so great for the smaller women when paired up against fitter more athletic women, some of which seem to win every time over the two seasons \n\n- the concept of paradise is boring now- they all do the same thing, order food and swim. Yes, they do get to find out about their partners, but how about arranging cute excursions or dates? Or having the winners of the challenge choose something to do whilst at paradise?\n\n- as seen in season 2, the same people keep getting picked for paradise. JY had a statistically higher probability of being picked every time (as there were 4 women who would\u2019ve chosen him) and he even professed he didn\u2019t even want to go. There should be an option to reject paradise worked in somehow \n- the challenges themselves are boring. Why not include something else to do with being on a deserted island, like making food for the ones you\u2019re interested in, or having to go foraging for food or winning challenges for food etc. \n\n- the trips to paradise are too often and should be spaced out more, with perhaps the show taking place over 14 days. There should be more emphasis on the conversations being had and smaller games being played on the tents, paradise just takes away from everything especially when it\u2019s just a friendship couple who go \n\nThere\u2019s a lot more I could delve into, but I really felt this season highlighted the problems with the show. Is there anything else I\u2019m missing?",

That was a bit of change, but it was only one time.  \nI agree that the stay should be a two weeks at least, instead of trying to cram everything in 7 days. I think three weeks would be ideal.  \nPersonally, I feel that Singles Inferno is really trying to win over the American audience watching on Netflix by making the show more like the trashy American reality dating shows we have here, where it's just good looking people in sexy outfits trying to make out with each other, or trying to fight with one another. Many people who watch American reality dating shows don't care about the people and their personalities, they just want to see hookups and conflict. And the people on the shows are usually not looking for relationships, and are just there to boost their followers/become influencers. Yes, I am sour on American reality dating shows. lol. Which is why I turned to Korean dating shows. So it's disappointing to me when I see the Korean shows starting to emulate the American shows.",

            "comment": "SI, like other so-called reality, unscripted dating shows, are social experiments. With the booming of social media content creators/influencers who crave public + global attention, these dating shows would surely target these individuals to take advantage of the individuals' subscriber/follower/fan database. In return, these individuals get more social exposure + financial  opportunities in many ways: modeling, acting, singing, TV shows, product/service spokesperson, etc. \n\nI agree with what you mentioned above. TBH, I found SI Season 1 a snooze fest. SI Season 2 is also a snooze fest, except after JY made his dramatic entrance + shook things up. His personality traits, to me, are intriguing, compared to the rest (and I have been his fan a few years before SI2), so it made me glued to the screen every time he's on. In other words, JY was the main reason that made me watch SI2 from Ep. 3-10. \n\nThe games in Season 2 are boring + repetitive of other variety shows. I was like, what am I watching? Iron Squad? The Soldiers? Sireum/wrestling channel? Running Man? 3 Days 2 Nights? The SI producers are not creative at all! \n\nThe activities in the Paradise Hotel are also dull. It's just product placement/advertising for that hotel: the room structure, facilities, room service, fancy dining, drinking, + a little mukbang. Again repetitive of those activities in other variety + travel shows. Make me fall asleep every time LOL.\n\nI wish for the next season, the producers will come up with different, exciting activities for the participants to join while at the same time get to know each other more closely. Filming it at a new, different location (please God, stop advertising the Paradise Hotel again!) would help but having similar activities like those in Seasons 1 &amp; 2 will kill viewers' interest completely. \n\nAnd please stop recruiting a cook/chef/restaurant/cafe owners, undergrads, Ascottage bosses/employees + popular content creators/influencers. Recruit normal people with interesting jobs + personality traits, those who seriously wanna date long-term. Since, it's a TV show, I'm sure physical attractiveness is still a must but this should balance with one's interesting personality traits + ability to carry out mature, wise + deep conversations during the show. No giddy, giggly, immature people, please!",

I don't blame them for doing this because it is an easy paycheck while also boosting their careers, but no one should take Single's Inferno as a serious dating show (Or any of the cohabitation shows really). \n\nSeason 1 had Freezia as the most popular girl (The second I saw she was on the show, I knew she had a 0% chance of wanting to date someone IMO). They also had that one dancer where I forgot his name who also recently appeared in Physical: 100. \n\nSeason 2 had 2 guys now actively pursuing more variety shows. So E had a minor role in \"The Glory.\" \n\nThe setting itself is overdramatic and doesn't show their actual characters considering they are completely separated from their normal lifestyle. It is nothing, but a glorified group blind date that takes place over a week(?). The deep connections will only form after the show is over, if they decide to keep in contact.",

It was ridiculous that they had to wait until they went to Paradise and could ONLY tell the person they went with... Unfortunately that backfired since &gt;!not all the contestants went to Paradise and they don't find out about them until about the day or 2 before they left the Island so what a waste...

Oh and it's likely borderline scripted.\n\nAny show that herds their cast away so they limit talking to only time on their dates and then only shows you the shallow parts of their discussions while on their dates (where I imagine they are often told what they can and can't talk about) is a HARDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD pass for me. Add in manipulative/selective editing in order to create villains and angels along with trying to create narratives and it's just about everything I hate about modern reality dating TV. It's basically The Bachelor. \n\nInstead, I really, really liked Transit Love 2. Even with the gimmicky exes thing, it was legit. Living together, lasting a month(?), free to talk about anything (other than the gimmicky restrictions which are fine), and seems to create some successful relationships. Not to mention the cast seem a bit more authentic and less entirely there for followers/fame. \n\nSingles Inferno, to get me back, would need to make a lot of the changes you mentioned. The isolated island in 100F temps is lame now that it's been done. It's only good because they're in swimsuits a lot. Paradise is boring AF and has been since S1. It's generic and very sterile. It's just a hotel with high ceilings and shit, who cares? The price for the paradise package they get is insane but not in a cool way. I completely agree that Paradise should instead be activities and such. The show should last longer, paradise trips should be fewer, there should be way more footage of discussions, if discussions don't happen naturally then production should create games in order to get serious, interesting and spicy questions asked &amp; answered. Lastly, casting should be done with creating successful couples in mind first before visuals, careers and what not. But they'll never do that cause then they don't land Nadine's who make the show go viral. That means people who are truly in a place in life to seriously date and the cast aren't from all around the world/SK which makes distance a major factor which can kill relationships before they barely even start. So many shows (esp in America with how big it is) get this wrong. So many couples fail because of long distance. \n\nSo yeah, it's basically the worst. Super short, super shallow, scripted-ish, highly produced, edited for narratives even if manipulative editing is required to make it so and no successful couples come out of it. It's reality TV at it's worse. Literally like 5% authentic. All that's left is a big scandal that the cast members already have partners back home and it will be 0%.",

Sorry if it's too long, I'll try to post a shorter version.\n\nIf you use unddit (/r/pushshift), etc. you will be able to read this comment (those things let you see really any comment from a user's profile, a subreddit, and so on) about Nadine's friend for Single's Inferno Season 3: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/118bva0/singles_inferno_needs_a_new_format/j9hcl26/\n\nThat deleted thread link has lists for other East Asian dramas/variety shows/et cetera to occupy your time as Season 3 is probably releasing in December 2023 or so.\n\nNadine's friend was scouted for Season 3 of Single's Inferno. The location seems to be in Korea, might be Jeju Island, etc. instead of that island near Incheon/Paradise City Hotel.\n\nNadine's friend is white/gay/etc. and so that could be a surprising element for the beginning/etc. of Single's Inferno Season 3. A few other Korean shows have done LGBT-friendly/etc. concepts recently.\n\n**Compiled list of other East Asian dating shows (this is initially sorta \"scandalous\" dating shows, like Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774), Secret Man and Woman (\ube44\ubc00\ub0a8\ub140), REA(L)OVE, et cetera, click through the thread links for more other info)**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/y83ke7/pink_lie_episode_4_discussion_spoilers/j584452/\n\nNadine's friend also said he knows a bit of Korean. It might be the same situation as Nadine where he lacks vocabulary but he should be able to understand the gist of simpler conversations. \n\nThere's a lot of /r/languagelearning apps for Korean/etc. btw, basically look into LingoDeer, Anki(Droid), Talk To Me In Korean, Learn Korean with GO! Billy Korean, et cetera. \n\nIt only takes say 10 minutes a day (dedicatedly, consistently) to build up language learning skills/knowledge/etc. as a lot of us consume Korean/Chinese/etc. media daily. And as such we're just now actively using it to better understand the grammar/vocabulary.\n\n---\n\nSo with the new location for Season 3, they may be able to show their personalities more. But the producers/writers/etc. will probably pick another love triangle/entanglement/etc. as the main focus for the show as that's how people get hooked, with the tensions and cliffhangers. And so we may never see the friendships/skills/etc. of the housemates.\n\nHopefully they have extra content like Terrace House (/r/terracehouse). Or say the Chinese dating shows, more so the YOUKU ones like **Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81)**, where they have bonus content without the panelists, actual unreleased scenes, livestreams with the housemates watching the episodes together, et cetera.\n\nAnyway, this is too long and may be randomly removed again, lmao, but yes, the games/activities/etc. to get the Paradise dates need some overhauling. Short version is that they better make it more safe and less traditional displays of masculinity/competition/et cetera, especially if they're recruiting housemates from careers that can't take physical injury.\n\n---\n\n**Nadine's friend, if not troll, spoiled some stuff for Season 3 of Single's Inferno in his post here**: https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/111lrz8/is_this_a_trap_foreigner_cast_in_reality_tv_series/\n\n**Some of us from /r/Singlesinferno2 had real time reaction to it as he was doing that AMA session, lol**: https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/111pydg/redditor_drops_hints_that_hes_nadines_friend_and/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/111tsh6/redditor_who_implied_that_hes_friends_with_nadine/\n\n---\n\nFor now, there's also the other East Asian dating/cohabitation/etc. shows. You'll probably enjoy the ones that have Single's Inferno's island/beach/etc. theme. A few of them changed things due to budget/etc.\n\n**More direct link and overview of the shows similar to Single's Inferno**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/102skks/nineteen_to_twenty_1920_a_new_netflix_youth/j2vkckf/\n\nThere's links to the Youtube links and so on in that thread, but here are the list of names: **Bed on the Beach**; **Sum+fing**; **Eden, Descendants of Instinct (\uc5d0\ub374)**; **Sleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774)**; **Chain Reaction (\uccb4\uc778\ub9ac\uc561\uc158)**; **Play Safe Play Me** (this is a Malaysian-Chinese dating show on Youtube from Leeroy Wong channel, has English subs); **Shuffle Island** (this is a Japanese dating show from ABEMA channel, no English subs)\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and Kdramas, East Asian films, et cetera, and more info on where to watch them**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10yej01/singles_inferno_confirmed_to_return_for_season_3/j7zqw31/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/10vdoyn/love_is_blind_korea/j7gz987/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10rr1t6/uma_game_episode_4_230202/j77hfij/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10r0dje/kpop_house/j6sw6un/",

                            "comment": "Fam, my thoughts are my thoughts as this is an open forum. Like I said, I have no excuse and that's my fault for going off-topic a lot. \n\nAnd my copy pastas are literally just thread links to past threads because yes these become walls of text. \n\nA lot of questions/threads are the same, come on now, you and I both know this. It's part of life, the spam everywhere even if it's already been experienced before. And as for further disclaimer, like I said, I am just a regular person, not really connected to any of these dating show companies, marketing companies, etc. Just a superfan.\n\nI don't know why you're harping on me when I only post on specific threads, id est dating show threads. Meanwhile there's other people here that I see even in /r/all and other subreddits quite a bit because they're perennially posting and addicted to the endless scrolling.\n\nThis isn't /b/ or other random social media sites, you know there's filters here or like you can tag people right. Like there's the Reddit Enhancement Suite extension/add-on/etc. to tag people. \n\nYou can also collapse threads by clicking that [-] button to the left of somebody's name in a thread. It takes literally a second to make your mouse hover it. Don't know how it is on the new reddit or mobile, I'm still using the old site layout before the redesign.\n\nOr you know, you can just click the block button, like wtf. Like I said, I don't really get into these back and forth conversations but let me know what you want. \n\n---\n\nSeriously, I always see \"unavailable\" now because of me constantly trying to spread the word about other dating shows. And these are from profiles or accounts that I've never interacted before. Meaning they just blocked me instead typing comments like yours, like it saves time you know.\n\nBut some of these accounts that are showing as unavailable are, again, people that post way more than me. So it really is just the wall of text that you have a problem with right.\n\nLike I said, I don't get hostile and I'm pretty chill most of the time and so those people probably blocked me due to the constant mentioning of other dating shows. \n\nSeriously, skim my profile through unddit/pushshift/etc. all the way back to when this account was created nearly 6 years ago now. You will see even in the deleted/edited comments that I don't interact much with people when it comes to conversations. \n\nSo like if you are tired of the the spam-like walls of text, just block and stop wasting your time complaining. \n\nReally no need to escalate the situation when you can just ignore or report the comment so that it gets filtered/removed, or again block. Like why bother with this type of interaction. It's not good for anything.\n\nI already apologized and said I'm trying to be better when it comes to posting, especially now that there's no major East Asian dating show airing. And yes I've failed because I'm only human, and like I said that's on me and I have no excuse.\n\nSo to save time, I think you should just block me because this is clearly a situation that bothers you. For me I have never really blocked anybody since the early days of social media, so that's before the 2010s. If I ever see crazy comments, I don't even report them (hell, I don't even upvote/downvote threads or comments outside of a few cases), I just keep scrolling/browsing/etc. because I'm used to that type of social media experience.\n\nIt's really not that hard you know, like again especially with reddit, there's a collapse button on the left side of people's names if you somehow don't want to block people. It makes their thread collapse and then you can read the rest of the thread.\n\n---\n\nFun fact: not a lot of people read the whole thread you know, it's only few of us. Like I read everything and so that's how I get my resources. But like I said, it only seems like I'm spamming because you're also in the same threads. For real, look at the threads I frequent and compare it to whatever. \n\nI don't post that much as I just chime in to post recommendations most of the time these days. This time period with Single's Inferno 2 is an outlier because again (I keep saying that, lol), I wanted to use the opportunity or Netflix popularity to promote the other dating shows. \n\nIs that a bad thing when there's barely any people in these communities. It's not a big impact in the grand scheme of things. Like those recommendations or walls of text are not for you, it's for the people that haven't seen them before. And yes I understand that it gets fatiguing, which is why I said that it'll naturally taper off, and it has...\n\nI basically just talked in circles now, like I said, it could be ADHD/etc. and I'm sorry that that's just how I type right now. Once again, I'm trying to fix it. I sound like a robot or broken record, but I promise (maybe), even if the progress is small, that's all it takes. That's how life works, once you get used to something, it can't really be immediately weaned off. \n\nIf you are a mobile user, that's probably why you are more frustrated. Like I said earlier, I am on desktop old.reddit.com and so for me I have no issues. But yes I know and understand what you mean. \n\nLife is just like that sometimes, you can't control others, and so what you must do is do your best to ignore them. It sounds stupid or hopeless but there's really nothing much we can do when we come across those situations. It's just how it be.\n\n---\n\nI highly suggest you block me in order to feel at ease. Life is not that serious, too much stress is unnecessary. There's things like UFOs/UAPs/USOs/etc. that are finally being disclosed. Those are much more interesting things than seeing the same comments over and over again from these slice of life or comedy and so on shows.\n\nAgain, I apologize if I have offended you and sorry if some parts of this post came across as patronizing/condescending/sarcastic/et cetera. I usually write in this type of stream of consciousness and so once more, that's also on me.\n\nLike I have no ill intent and so just brush past any further offences that may appear on my written thoughts here. It feels like I went overly defensive/overboard/etc. with this response but I don't know how else to display an acknowledgement of the situation at hand. I could've been more succinct, but unfortunately my mind's not in sync right now for concise sentences/paragraphs.\n\nI'm way too emotionally detached from engaging in these interactions hence why I don't really participate in any threads. Seriously back then, usually I just post one wall of text and then dip or never really say anything more.\n\nLike I'm just a lurker/browser/etc. and not active commenter because it's easy to get trapped in back and forth conversations like this and frankly it's not that productive when there's a lot of media backlog out there to clear and consume for better experience.\n\nSigh, again, sorry for going in circles, I said a lot there but it could've been shortened to like a paragraph. See, it's kinda out of control, my mind just wanders sometimes. And yes, I am of sound mind (I only consume water and food, no other extra stuff, really), it's just that right now I'm kinda sleep-deprived and so it unfortunately flowed like this.",

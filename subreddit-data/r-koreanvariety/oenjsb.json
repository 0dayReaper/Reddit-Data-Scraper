    "postText": "According to media outlet reports on July 6th, Yoo Jae Suk's exclusive contract with his current label, FNC Entertainment, will be coming to an end on July 15th. \n\nAs both Yoo Jae Suk and FNC Entertainment have decided not to renew Yoo Jae Suk's current contract, he will become a free agent in the entertainment industry. Yoo Jae Suk first signed with FNC Entertainment back on July 16th, 2015. 3 years later in July 2018, he renewed his contract with the label for another 3 years but this time, he has decided not to renew. \n\nAn insider has confided that an agency has already contacted Yoo Jae Suk to sign the contract with them. Stay tuned for more details. \n\nSource - https://www.allkpop.com/article/2021/07/yoo-jae-suk-to-become-a-free-agent-after-deciding-not-to-renew-with-fnc-entertainment\n\nKorean source - https://news.jtbc.joins.com/article/article.aspx?news_id=NB12015072\n\nI decided to provide both a korean and english source for those who don't want to google translate the korean one and for those who don't trust allkpop, but they both say the same thing",

This was also at the same time that his family was growing too. So I can see why he signed with FNC when he did. Also FNC has a lot of experience with top level celebs so they are trustworthy I guess.",

During that time, FNC also took in a lot of YJS\u2019s colleagues such as Ji Suk Jin, Song Eun I, Jung Hyun Don and Noh Hong Chul, especially when NHC was under a drunk driving scandal. So, I think that his friends in the Agency played a part while recruiting YJS who was a free agent for several years at the time. He usually joke with JSJ and [SEI](https://youtu.be/OnRhJs1h5oo) why they left after getting him in the Agency.",

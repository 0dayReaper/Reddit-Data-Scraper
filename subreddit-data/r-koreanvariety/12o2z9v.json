    "postText": "I'm a sucker for Korean Variety especially with lots of comedies and interactions between the casts, apart from Running Man, I've fallen down into the rabbit hole of Sixth Sense which is truly a real gem and Busted which though it can look scripted, it really is a fun show.\n\nI don't really know many or recent shows, apart from what's shown in my cable TV and it's hard to search Google for the right answer.\n\nShow's I've already watched and still follow.\n\n* Running Man\n* Sixth Sense\n* Busted\n* 2D1N\n* Lee Hyori's Bed and Breakfast\n* The Return of Superman\n* Physical 100\n* Labor for Hire\n* Show!terview with Jessi\n* Edit: Added. The Zone: Survival Mission\n\n~~I'm not exactly a fan of idol-based TV shows. What I meant, shows that only casts idols, i.e. Produce, Weekly Idol doing \"idol-stuff\".~~\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all the suggestions!\n\nThe ones I've added on my list are luckily available on the platform I'm using! Thank you!\n\n* Planning to watch (in no concrete order):\n   * Earth Arcade\n   * Great Escape\n   * Crime Scene\n   * New Journey To The West\n   * Sister Slam Dunk",

The sleepers who made the show amazing were Kim Dong-hyun and P.O. - both variety rookies who came across honestly and charmed us with their sincere and hilarious interactions.  The whole cast worked perfectly together and created a great dynamic.  The sets were amazing too.\n\nAlso I can't believe no one has mentioned the OG - Family Outing - this was the show that IMHO kicked off the genre.  Hyori, YJS, Kookie, Big Bang's Daesung, Lee Chunhee, Kim Su Ro and Park Yejin made the first season perfection.  Skip season two, new cast- no chemistry whatsoever.",

This show was a lockdown baby, so they probably won\u2019t make another season, but its so amazing and these celebs really let you in on their personalities. \n\nIts such a fun show. I highly recommend it.\n\nAlso, I really recommend watching Queendom. This show allows female kpop idols the chance to sing and dance to songs styles they want to perform instead of just doing what the agency wants, and whats so amazing about the show is that it gives an opportunity for the different kpop groups to collaborate with eachother, and they are given ample space for them to let their personalities out, and many of the girls take the opportunity to show respect to more senior artists that they loved as well as remixing songs from other groups.\n\nThe male version Kingdom sucks, they have like no personality in that show, they don\u2019t really hang out or connect with eachother like the girls. Although there is one song from Kingdom that I highly recommend listening to called - Mayfly Love Poem (a cover of IU\u2019s song)",

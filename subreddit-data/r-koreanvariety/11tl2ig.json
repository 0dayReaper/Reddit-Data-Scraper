Like yea, home made probably wouldn\u2019t taste any better than the mass produced stuff and be a ton of work, but if I go to a restaurant I expect something special unless its basically a bar first where people can hang out and they use prepacked stuff for barsnacks just to make sure people don\u2019t starve.\n\nEspecially since its a TV show I expect things to be more of an experience than just stuff that can be easily bought in a grocery store.",

They add some value because they have long business hours. Also, typically with these restaurant chains that use prepackaged food, its food you can\u2019t buy at the grocery store, since the customers can\u2019t easily replicate it there is less problems with their methods.\n\nMeanwhile Jinny\u2019s kitchen seems to only work 8hours a day, they open at weird hours, its really odd that they don\u2019t open for lunch, and then closing down the store in the middle of their shift for breaks.\n\nI also don\u2019t think its fair to assume that everyone there knows that they are getting their food made by actors. Its a vacation type of spot so there are tons of foreign people going to the store, and its purposely not advertised. They probably know that its being film, but even that is not very guaranteed, lots of people there speak different languages. Most of the people eating there really look like they don\u2019t know what they are getting into.",

There are commercial brands that package stuff in bulk but it\u2019s the same crap you buy in the grocery store.

It's cool tho that he had fans who recognized him many years later. He's gotten more direct recognition than Global Star Tae has so far. Tae got that sweet note from the younger girl and few customers have recognized him as a famous singer, but no one I think has directly told him I love BTS and you, etc.",

They should serve it once just straight for some of them to really experience fire heat!",

    "postText": "The one constant with Korean variety shows has been the cast is usually dominated by male members. If there is a mix, the female members are typically outnumbered by a large ratio with very few exceptions. \n\nThe chemistry of this cast works very well imo because it\u2019s so different when YJS is often flustered and seems to not be in control as he would normally be on RM/HDYP. The original four ladies seem to really enjoy one another and are at their best when they trigger YJS and LSY.\n\nI hope Chul Min PD gets another opportunity where they can book a show that has regular guests, absent of corny skits, and allow the ladies to shine. All while hearing the PD laughing hysterically in the background \n\nIt\u2019d be a great waste to not bring this cast back together soon assuming there will not be any new seasons of Sixth Sense.",

The mixture of him getting teased while also getting doted on is very cute. And he's excellent at making people feel comfortable and relaxed. \n\nI can't foresee the entire cast of SS getting casted together in the future but I'd love to see him do another show that's majority women.",

Where she would have to put on a face and be happy then inevitably deal with whatever criticize fans send her way each week when new episodes air.\n\nPsy royally fucked up his kpop group by forcing them to strict training instead of allowing them to be more laid back like american artists. They had a magical songwriting line where a korean American forced the very technically skilled producer into making better songs. Without the american all of his songs sounded incredibly generic. They also did the dumbest thing of selecting a young pre-puberty kid to be apart of the group and then kicking him out before they debuted. The young kid was easily the best dancer in the entire kpop industry (he originally was a tournament winning krump dancer). They really could have had something special by merging american Rap style with Kpop and krump dancing. The world has been primed by BTS for kpop to take over so in my opinion, its incredibly foolish to not bend over backwards to keep the american songwriter. These kpop groups should really be leaning into the multi-language fanbases more by prioritizing english speaking members.\n\nJust look at XG, their girl group is all Japanese members, and yet they\u2019ve been produced in korea, all of their songs are in english and they actually have a unique identity, they aren\u2019t just another generic kpop group. They are doing like 5x the numbers on youtube as pnation\u2019s group, and pnation\u2019s group piggybacked off of psy and jyp by selecting their group on a reality tv show. You would think of all people in the korean music industry, Psy would understand the importance of international fans.",

He's pretty outspoken about being disappointed that ad-lib / role play variety is dying out. There's a reason he joined both 'Busted' and 'The Zone' while also having role play episodes in HDYP. \n\nThere are quite a few women that work well with Jae Seok while playing the 'dominant' role. Park Mi Sun, Jo Hye Ryun, Song Eun I (+All the women at Content Lab), Lee Hyori, Son Dam Bi etc. \n\nWith how experienced Jae Seok is, he can make anyone appear like they are making him flustered. It was possibly his 2nd, or 3rd time working the Lee Eun Ji before he chest bumped her? He can build chemistry with any talented person quickly.",

The cast would get really good at spotting the fakes, PDs would quickly run out of ideas for fake concepts, the probably astronomical production cost per episode, etc. I know CHul Min has said that RM episodes were actually more expensive but building sets for RM are less intensive than Sixth Sense. The research they needed to do and coming up with concepts every week must have been exhausting. They hit the jackpot with the cast chemistry though. LSY needed more time to fully adjust but he was close with almost everyone even before Sixth Sense.\n\nIMO they need to bring it back. I may be biased but the cast chemistry was up there with RM and even though they had trouble finding guests, most of the guests they did find did really well. Lee Yi-Kyung, Kim Ji-seok, Kai, Key, the rappers, Solar and Moonbyul, Kim Jong-min and some others were standouts. The two dancer girls were really fun too but for me, it was JSM that made that episode funnier. Also, even though I was dissappointed that JSM was mostly gone for S3, Mijoo got to stood out more and she was really good. I don't think Jesse was the problem they had casting guests.  I think it was the nature of the show itself. I mean, IF it wasn't scripted, most guests would be wary of looking stupid. Cutting this show off at S3 was a big L. I think I read somewhere that the network had a 3 season rule but nah. The cast was just hitting it stride. Unfortunately, IMO, I think the crew were running out of ideas. I mean how many times did they do a restaurant theme?",

I\u2019m only basing this off his RM projects when he took over. I remember YSC always being surprised at the scale of things. Plus he was known to keep the staff late.

First episode of S3 with the crypto millionaire young woman. What a bad idea. You can clearly see the cast, especially YJS, trying hard to make it look like \"oooh this is plausible\" when in reality, making that much money was basically impossible from what little capital she said she started with and starting as late as she did. The sleeping capsule restaurant was another bad one. No one in their right mind would think this business makes money. You can see a decline in quality towards the end. The crew was straight up cheating. They said if it was fake, then everything was fake. I don't thin renting an already existing restaurant and just redesigning it counted. In S1, they would definitely built a restaurant out of scratch. Renting an already existing restaurant or place that used to be a restaurant seemed half-assed. Especially when the the cast inspects the place, of course they would find traces of a real restaurant because it actually was at one point. The fake owners, yep everything they present is fake, but I think the crew also told the real owners to try and throw off the cast. That said, it was still funny as hell. I thought it would get a season 4 for sure.",

I do wonder about the guests tho, since YJS said several times on the show that they were having trouble casting guests.  Jesse is probably the biggest reason for this, but all of the members except LSY can wear someone out tbh. Also i think if they wanted it to be profitable they'd need more than just cast chemistry to carry the show.",

It is so hilarious when they really fluster the guests because you see it on their blushing faces.\n\nJessie\u2019s unique presence has created some memorable interactions with the female chest bumping. I think her American personality rubbed off well with the cast.\n\nNara is just that classy and elegant older sister. She brings out her kkondae character when hoobae actresses appear on the show. Pretty funny when she was riding the girl from sky castle\n\nI think the issues with guest booking early on was Covid.",

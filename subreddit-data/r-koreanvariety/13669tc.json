            "comment": "Netflix has confirmed the release date of the strong women's team battle survival entertainment show \"Siren: Island of Fire\" on the 30th and released a teaser poster.\n\nThe survival battle survival entertainment show \"Siren: Island of Fire,\" in which 24 women with both the strongest fighting power and detailed strategies team up in six occupational groups and collide fiercely on an unknown island, presented a poster on the 3rd.\n\nThe logo of each team, consisting of animals and point colors that give a glimpse of each team's personality, from police to firefighters, bodyguards, stunts, soldiers, and athletes, foreshadows a professional team battle with each professional group's characteristics.\n\nOn top of that, various types of bases, such as the main stadium Arena, mountain ranges, water houses, and tents, as well as public spaces such as drinking water tables and hospitals reminiscent of Roman-era stadiums in the past, raise expectations. The 24 women, who have been recognized for their strength in their respective fields, will write their own dramas through strong teamwork and convey their feelings and lingering feelings to viewers.",

            "comment": "This looks really cool. Finding women-focused shows, let alone ones filled with such a variety of them is rare as heck. Would have preferred it if it was cooperation or a friendly competition but survival sells so I get it. Also not too keen on the show being called Siren since it's often used to depict women in a negative light as temptresses but I reckon it could just be an off-the-mark translation or half-cooked idea of a title. At least the scale seems to be pretty big given the summary by OP so I can expect a lot of  different and fun challenges. Not sure if the 6 groups of 4 are fighting till the last group for a prize or it's a points based system or whatever they decide but the fact that it's split in groups based on occupation is a pretty neat idea. Would def check it out once it's released so thanks for the rec!\n\nEdit: Looking it up, it seems to be titled \"Siren: Survive the Island\" so the siren usage is a tiny bit less awkward. Still, having just seen the trailer, it's definitely more a cross b/w Artemis and Amazonians with the emphasis on survival and strength in the wilderness but I guess that doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.",

Def see them having to compete with a team mentality (based on their occupations/department) like Steel Troops except it's leaning more on the rougher aspects of survival rather than spec ops stuff. \n\nJust from the trailer alone, I get a feeling the show's gonna try to showcase more closeups than is expected (imagine a less underhanded ver of when shows do those slow-mo closeups of men's toned bodies). That's coming from a female who loves athletic women and even I found some of the framed shots to be funnily intense. So all in all, I find it unlikely it's going to be similar to Shooting Stars especially since SS is focused on female celebrities lowkey just having fun and being passionate about soccer. I hope I am wrong and it turns out this show isn't like the other standard Netflix-fare and gives us more depth.",

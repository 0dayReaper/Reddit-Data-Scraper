    "postText": "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim\\_Gu-ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Gu-ra)\n\nIn this wikipedia page, there's no mention of his past as an underground Internet radio host. He gained fame (or notoriety) first through that. In the early 2000s, he teamed up with two other people with not-so-elegant names such as *Hwang Bong-al* (kinda, Hwang Scrotum) and *No Suk-ja* (homeless). \"Gu-ra\" itself is a vulgar slang word for \"lie\" or \"fib\"\n\nHe basically built his career by trash-talking and hurting women in entertainment. An example is what he and his co-hosts said about a transgender singer Ha Risu. She was literally their punching bag, and they said vulgar and discriminatory things like  e.g. (skip it if you don't want vulgarity) &gt;!\"You know what, trannies have strong jaws (a-gu) so they suck it a lot better\"!&lt;  (Kim Gu-ra himself said) &gt;!\"(If I have to fuck her) I'll just check her artificial boobs and vagina and will jerk off to that\"!&lt;\n\nHe mostly targeted female celebrities to degrade and slut-shame. He often claimed that the female celebrities were prostitutes and slept their way up. He made false claims like he saw a female celebrity in a karaoke room (to provide a sexual service to a powerful man), etc. He had made millions of comments on a lot of women in entertainment\n\n[https://onehallyu.com/topic/348965-kevbactalk-top-7-most-offensive-things-kim-gura-has-said-their-impact/](https://onehallyu.com/topic/348965-kevbactalk-top-7-most-offensive-things-kim-gura-has-said-their-impact/) The text in this link is a bit broken, but has a lot of truth about him\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still don't understand how he could clean his public image and became a major television host. I don't understand why k netizens were so upset about a little stupid thing that Yoo Ah-in said on Twitter, but they don't attack Kim Gu-ra.\n\nI just want more people to know about him.",

It\u2019s even crazy that I\u2019ve been following K-variety for the past 15yrs but never have the desire to watch any of his shows even tho some of it are/were pretty popular (ex: Radio Star, Same Bed Different Dreams, etc.).\n\nBtw this thread kinda remind me of what happened with actor [Lee Geung-young/Lee Kyung-young](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Geung-young) too. He\u2019s a really famous actor and I\u2019ve seen him in a lot of dramas and movies. K-netizens hate him so much due to his past and even want to ban him to not ever show up in entertainment anymore. I can\u2019t really find any good/credible translate articles, but there are lot of articles about him in Korean.\n\nNamu wiki provides a detail explanations on his case but I can\u2019t hyperlink it, so will put the link here:\nhttps://namu.wiki/w/\uc774\uacbd\uc601%20\ubbf8\uc131\ub144\uc790%20\uc131\ub9e4\ub9e4%20\uc0ac\uac74",

Just like me, a lot of people don't know about the things he's done, but even then, he's a sunbaenim. It's hard to call an old dude out on his dirty tricks, especially in a \"respect\" based society like Korea.

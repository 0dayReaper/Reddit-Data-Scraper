It was about connection and trust, and what a glorious warm journey omg\n\nI have just started watching Korean dating shows, and I would love more recommendations for dating shows that have a couple kind of hitting it off in the first episode and they also are end game. \n\nI have watched Love Exchange 2 and love &gt;!HG and HE!&lt;. She wasn\u2019t into him at first, but it also kinda fits because there is trust involved. \n\nThank you, and also I hope I have posted this in the right place and right way!",

So basically the whole cast brought it. The timings , missed opportunities and the short duration of the show really leaves you with a lot of feelings. It's perfect timing to watch it cause you have cast coming out telling their sides . Honestly you could teach a whole psych class analysing their interactions.",

            "comment": "I am Solo has produced several married couples (depends on the season). Love Catcher 1 and 2 have had end game couples who dated/are still dating. From memory Heart Signal 3 had a couple that was spotted dating afterwards, and there are also some couples from Chinese heart signal seasons who are still together. I believe Eden 2 also produced a real couple but the show was so uncomfortable to watch I dropped it.",

            "comment": "**Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac)** is for sure gonna be a classic in the years to come.\n\nSo with first episode and then end game, it's actually kinda rare for that to happen. And it's sorta spoilers to say which ones it'll be, so just look through the thread links below for the summaries.\n\nBasically like some of them seem end game but random things (producer-influenced though in sad reality it's just avoidable clich\u00e9 miscommunication issues, lol) happen before the final decision and so a lot of couples do not form, lol. Love at first sight is crazy strong but ya it can fizzle.\n\nWait a minute, I just remembered the Chinese dating shows often have that end game ship from the start. You're in luck. Basically **the Chinese version of Heart Signal (\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7)** has that. Go with Season 2 and Season 5 as those are considered the best by the fans. There's also **Twinkle Love** and **Relationship S3/Let's Fall In Love Season 3**, and many more.\n\nWith Korean shows, it's kinda again, pretty rare. If you don't mind the rawness, you can try **I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO (/r/IamSolo)**, it's a very different style of dating show though as it's more mature and older regular people: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10en6s3/couples_who_are_still_together_after_dating_show/j4sgvhq/\n\nLong story story, I Am Solo actually has marriages and now babies from the show, lol.\n\n---\n\nTry **Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81)**, it is one of the best shows for coming of age trips/events. Sorta like **Terrace House: Boys &amp; Girls in the City** youthfulness. \n\n**More info on Twinkle Love and other similar Ainori Love Wagon or traveling/culture/etc. shows:** https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10pyock/im_just_sad_terrace_house_is_gone_i_miss_them_all/j6rhk67/\n\nBasically for Twinkle Love they're university students that are having a field trip, lol. So they get missions, dates, et cetera. They got them islands too, kinda.\n\nTwinkle Love has a lot of friendships formed in the show, you get to see bromances, sismances, etc.\n\nAs in it's one of the best shows for platonic friendships and all that, and you can see them shipping each other and so on, lmao. Like OMG (with NewJeans: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZAgIHmHLdc), they're so meta with Twinkle Love sometimes.\n\nIt's also a great show if you want to go back/forward to that freshness of young adult life ([btw, flamingos and parrots are geese] (https://www.reddit.com/r/heartsignal/comments/ns11y8/friends_share_life_terrace_house_twinkle_love/)).\n\n**For Twinkle Love, at the end of each day they have to record a message for the person they liked/spent time the most. And listen to their own message (through earbuds) IN FRONT OF EVERYONE, so it's kinda dramatic af, lol.**\n\nTwinkle Love is free on the YOUKU channel on Youtube, they have English subs.\n\n**Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81), Season 1 Episode 1**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxP-Ye9kr24\n\n**Twinkle Love Season 2 (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81 \u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b63) Episode 1 Part 1**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78vUkTAhuG8\n\n---\n\n**Relationship S3/Let's Fall In Love Season 3 (\u6211\u4eec\u604b\u7231\u5427 \u7b2c\u4e09\u5b63)** is so good if you like slice of life. Episode 1 from YOUKU Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JprQ5Fd4Qo\n\nLet's Fall In Love Season 3 is a more mature or really laidback version of these dating shows though as they're in a somewhat rural/etc. area (city of Dali by Erhai Lake in Yunnan, southwest China) and so there's less of that hustle feeling. Some shots of this show really gives you that slice of life bliss.\n\nLike that idyllic, bucolic life, with the picturesque fields, forests, mountains, et cetera.\n\nYou know Liu Yifei or the Mulan actress? She's currently in a romcom/drama set in Dali/Yunnan.\n\nIt's called **Meet Yourself (\u53bb\u6709\u98ce\u7684\u5730\u65b9)**, here's Episode 1 (with English subs) from the \u534e\u7b56\u5f71\u89c6\u5b98\u65b9\u9891\u9053 China Huace TV Official Channel, but you can also watch it on Viki: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj__X2BRhyo\n\n---\n\nSome people's list is probably like this: **Shanghai Sharelife** preferred over **Terrace House**, which is favored over **Heart Signal (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110)**, and now the **EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560)** series, with possibly **Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac)** and **Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774)** in tow.\n\nAt the moment the current influential dating shows in East Asia goes like this: Terrace House inspired Heart Signal and then Heart Signal gave way to Transit Love/EXchange. Single\u2019s Inferno is also kinda in this as a lot of island/beach/etc. shows got made because of it.\n\n---\n\n**More on EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560) Season 1 and 2 and where to watch these dating shows**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10rg5m3/everyone_who_watches_singles_inferno_pls_watch/j6w8fhx/\n\n**More info on ArmsAsuncion's website for redditors (it has East Asian dating/variety/etc. shows, Kdramas/Jdoramas/Cdramas/et cetera), tteokbeokkisubs/noonaspoiler, adblock, VPNs, and so on**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10fpzhx/overall_thoughts_on_love_catcher_in_bali/j5cmhaw/\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and more info on where to watch them**: https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/10n6m04/transit_love_2_vs_singles_inferno_2/j6br4qc/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10is12e/where_i_can_find_terrace_house_seasons_before_the/j5i25id/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/1076jds/good_dating_shows/j3kxjmx/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zyn2y0/regarding_the_popularity_of_the_different_dating/j2a8bok/\n\n**For more comments/overview/etc. on East Asian dating shows, check these threads**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iyso9ql/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iz8ayph/\n\n---\n\n**Check MyDramaList too for a more visual list of these East Asian variety shows, dating shows, dramas, et cetera**.

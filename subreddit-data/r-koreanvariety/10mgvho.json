She's the 3rd i've seen in the last few months. \n\nI was shocked they all skipped the first woman but i think it's bc she said she was blunt. And maybe her age too (she was older than everyone except neurosurgeon).\n\nYeji (designer/model) is a hoot lol i like her so far \n\nI like the way yumi (nurse) talks \n\nLol busan mijoo is entertaining too\n\nYooooo sparks are flying btw yeji x golfer! I love their banter! \n\nOmg the skip zone is even worse this time. Outside, in the winter, standing beside heaters??? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f What was the point of going to the suburbs to a much bigger set if the skip zone was gonna be so lame? Lmao maybe they want them to be as uncomfortable as possible so that they form new pairs quickly? Yessss go patent attorney!!! I like how proactive she is. Bulldozer indeed. \n\nWhy would they both just stand there? I'd go back in just to be warmer \ud83d\ude05 but also it can't hurt to talk to an extra person even just to rule them out \n\nLmao the neurosurgeon kept talking abt spine health during the review of all their dances \n\nOoooooh i like this group. Excited for the musical chairs next week.\n\nDoes anyone else think the choice of theme song for this show is odd? Girls don't cry?\n\nAlso if someone could link the talent show we missed of that one guy, that would be great!",

The MCs are great from an entertainment perspective but national MC Jae Suk shouldn't tease these nervous non-celeb participants looking to find a match.\n\nHardly got to hear any conversations amongst the participants. Just got more MC banter.\n\nI kind of hoped that Duk Gyun will 'heart' Hye Rin but that was not to be considering that she was the first female 'skipper'.\n\nNeed more characters like Ye Ji to come on this show. She made the episode entertaining and her dancing was superb. Loved So Min's reaction to her dance.",

But then I realized I'm projecting and if it was me, I would never choose to appear on a dating show in the first place. Because let's be real, 90-100% of the contestants are people who are just looking for clout/publicity and have really thick skin. It's not going to bother them. \n\nAnd I actually do think YJS's teasing helps the contestants lighten up. It also diffuses the inevitable awkward moments that arise. I've noticed Haha and JSJ also have similar methods, where they'll poke at people who are nervous and it always helps the other person relax. If you watch YJS with regular citizens on You Quiz, he's much more gentle and sensitive so I think he's aware of how far he can go. \n\nAbout Yeji, I loved her! Her confidence and general aura was really entertaining and fun. Would love it if there were more people like her.",

            "comment": "Depends on what kind of genre you prefer, but for now I can suggest:\n\n* **Earth Arcade** \\- a Na PD variety w/ Lee Eunji, OhMyGirl Mimi, Lee Youngji, IVE Yujin - they travel outside Korea, play games and complete missions related to the backstory.\n* **Dancing Queens on the Road** \\- a Kim Taeho PD show w/ Kim Wansun, Uhm Junghwa, Lee Hyori, BoA, Hwasa - follows them around Korea preparing for and performing pop-up concerts, busking gigs, and other smaller scale events (a so-called *healing* show); when they're not performing or practicing, they're talking about the industry, how it was in the 80s/90s/early 2000s, what has changed, reminisce about stuff, talk about life, etc.\n* If you like it, then I'd suggest also watching the **Refund Sisters** segment on \"How Do You Play\"/\"Hangout with Yoo\" (you can check the exact episodes on wikipedia) - Yoo Jaesuk forms a girl group consisting of - Uhm Junghwa, Lee Hyori, Jessi, Hwasa.\n* **HyeMiLeeYeChaePa** \\- another healing show with Girls' Day Hyeri, (G)-Idle Miyeon, Leejung Lee, Choi Yena, LeSserafim Chaewon, Patricia Yiombi - they spend several weekend at an initially empty house that they gradually decorate by playing games and winning points.\n* **Sister's Slam Dunk** \\- w/ Ra Miran, Kim Sook, Hong Jinkyung, Min Hyorin, Jessi and Tiffany - the show's goal is to fulfil every members dream. The also formed a girl group and released a single.\n* **Street Woman Fighter** \\- a survival show where 8 female dance crews compete for the title. popularizing dancing and the choreographers that are behind many kpop hits. Many of its cast members have remained on tv/youtube as variety personalities, such as Aiki, Gabee, Leejung, Monika, Lip J.\n\nSister's Slam Dunk is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC6ZJVU235Y&amp;list=PLMf7VY8La5RHmdvOuNXIj3HpFD5NKyWW6&amp;index=33). HyeMiLeeYeChaePa is on Viki/Kocowa and the rest are on VIU. Depending on your location, none of them might be available for you, so you can search the sub for previously posted links or just use google search armed with an adblocker.",

I think there were individual group memebers that showed their true selves but this was the 1st time a group of them did it together.No make-up most of the time, farting and more. Really great show. The 1st season was the best though.",

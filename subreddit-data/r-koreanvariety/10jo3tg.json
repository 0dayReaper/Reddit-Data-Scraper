When your hair extension got pulled, coaches rolling around, grabbing and got climbed on to win a game, you know that they were serious about winning, Cae Ri Na being a contender for 50m race was just amazing. Remember how old she is and her interview when she joined the show. Saori's speed is no joke, especially her first race. She got even faster on her second one. Crazy.",

The singer group will probably be the tiniest in terms of physique.\n\nThe donation of 100 soccer balls is kinda lame no? I thought the show could donate more money to maybe getting underprivileged youth into sports or something.\n\nWoooooooooow i was not expecting saori to run so much faster than kim hye sun! Damnnnnnnn. Even hyuni and young jin were faster than kim hye sun, maybe she was under the weather that day. Lmaaaaooo she just came from germany, that's why. \n\nHow did KH fall????? That was so weird. I was expecting a lot from her. It almost looked intentional? \n\nJJJ def let his sunbaes win right? I'm impressed all those old men still made it under 8 seconds \ud83d\ude05\n\nI feel like MK won tug of war for her team just based on her charisma lol \n\nLmaoooooo jin chul and coach ha's weird somersault wrestling during the photo match \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nI wish irene were there! Just noticed she's missing no? \n\nUhhhhh how are they all so good at staying still??? Even their facial expressions \ud83d\ude33\n\nMK grabbing onto people's feet during the last game was so savage \ud83d\ude02\n\nI have such a soft spot for sports days. That was so fun!!!!!",

            "comment": "My highlights: \n\n1. Wow, I didn't realize Kim Ga Young (Anaconda) was so fast!\n2. Saori, didn't disappoint! Speedster for sure. \n3. I wish Heo Kyung Hee (Giants) who fell could have gotten a try-over, even just to get her official time to compare with the others. \n4. Soyeon (Fire Moth) not disappointing with her speed. Even with some unclean starts and like \\~10lbs or more on all the girls, she proves to be the 4th fastest woman there. Beast.\n5. Okay I just love tiny 20 year old Seogi boldly takes charge, telling her team of seniors how to play tug-of-war so confidently. Then running over to the new teammates to tell them her \"secret\" plan. Lol. Adorable and badass given how Koreans seem to usually act around seniors when they are young. Even when they lose, she criticizes the coaches strategy and says they needed to use hers. Lmao. She is now one of my fav players not just based on play but personality too. \n6. Lol, the models &amp; news hosts/presenters saying they are like dandelions. I agree ladies, so hit the gym! Lol.  \n7. It's hard to watch this and imagine there being no Anaconda next season. It's hard to believe the producers are happy with that. Taejin and Sieun are CHARACTERS and they get serious screen time. Heck, Taejin with her rival match was heavily featured in the promos for the Olympic style special, from what I saw. Not to mention it is a team of \"single\" \\~30 year old attractive women and the team itself had an underdog story that lead to the glory of their first win and their play was improving. I'm excited for the new team but if Anaconda just disappears and IF some of the players (specifically Taejin) don't return when the team is no longer suspended? Oh boy... I'll be annoyed. \n8. The edit really favored Yoon-ju and Kim Ga Young. Kim Ga Young was someone I don't think ever got much screen time to showcase her personality so I'm really happy this special did. She is super cute. Yoon-ju is humorous and expressive which is fun too. \n9. Lmao, Soo-geun pulling Seogi on the cart as the cast sing karaoke.",

It is unreal how fast she gets and seeing her in the actual races against the others really puts it into perspective.\n\nThe only thing I was confused about - why was kim byung ji (current coach of natfam) not on their team. He was with his previous gavengers team. I guess it was maybe to make the numbers work out?",

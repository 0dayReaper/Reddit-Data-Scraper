    "postText": "They've just released several scenes that got cut off:\n\n 1. Hyunji's Betrayal\nhttps://youtu.be/Cqo_qoEzrCA\n\nShin Hyunji talks to Jinhyung that she intends to drop Hong Jinho and Seo Chulgu before it's too late. Because she's sure the two of them will just go the finals if things continue so. Also, it turns out she shared infos with Lee Jinhyung for the Main Match. This confirms that the two of them have an ongoing alliance for now. \n\n2.  Wild Team Breaking Apart\nhttps://youtu.be/QH_oOei1uco\n\nSeo Chulgu questioning the wasted coins. Dex defends saying Hyunji and himself needs to at least do something/anything to save themselves too. Hong Jinho trying to explain both sides. \n\n3. YunB's Pi Gaslighting Continuation\nhttps://youtu.be/TiritCi4HLk\n\nYunB just can't stop running his mouth about Pi's betrayal. Even talking about being humane and what not. Seo Chulgu refutes all of his points since YunB's getting overboard, saying that with YunB's logic, what does that make Ha Seungjin's play?\n\n\nEdit:\n\nNew Vid (30/05/2023)\n\n4. During Nux vs Hong Jinho Death Match\nhttps://youtu.be/D22etNPOIV0\n\nPi tells Jinhyung how Hyunji proposed a no death match agreement to her. Seo Chulgu\u2019s praising Hong Jinho. YunB and Dex comparing the game to One Piece. Hyunji et al talking about the model life.",

            "comment": "Since I summarised these videos elsewhere, I figure I'll post them here as well.\n\nVideo 1:\n\n* Hyunji (HJ) calls Jinhyeong (JH) over and explains she wants Jinho or Xitsuh out today because they're so strong. \"When they're together, it's like hitting a rock with an egg\" (ie. They're unbeatable). She wants to stop them from coming 1st at least.\n* HJ says she can't work with JH since she's still in the alliance but is considering sharing their strategy with him, acting as a spy.\n* JH asks HJ about what'll happen in the semifinals when 2 have to beat the others (they seem to assume it'll be the S1 format). Hyunji uses the egg/rock phrase again and says those 2 making the finals is too obvious.\n* JH has doubts (but his vocab kinda goes over my head). I think he tells HJ he's worried that the OG Jungle team is working too well.\n* She says that in a blink of an eye, they'll all be eliminated and those 2 will remain.\n* JH agrees, saying that if you don't come 1st, surviving longer is meaningless. He tells her he thinks she's being sincere.\n* She seems to have been having these thoughts since last night (ie. E8).\n* We cut to confessionals. JH seems to think HJ doesn't want to keep being lead and he says eliminating strong people is always agreeable.\n* The graphics indicate \"Hyunji and Jinhyeong form a secret alliance\"\n* We cut forward into the game...\n* JH and HJ both share the 8th hour. HJ wants to just push to 8 to both get points, but JH disagrees because (based on Seungjin snatching Xitsuh's notebook), Xitsuh also has 8 and they shouldn't be giving him points. HJ wants to push ahead anyway and thinks Xitsuh wrote fake numbers anyway.\n* JH starts being suspicious of HJ's intentions, wondering if Jinho sent her over to soy on him.\n* After this, HJ thinks JH may have lied about his time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVideo 2:\n\n* Xitsuh (XS) comes back to the Jungle team after getting info from Pi and Dex used 13 coins (Jinhyeong is here too). Dex says he took a gamble.\n* XS asks why they suddenly gambled like it didn't matter. Jinho tries to explain, but XS says that's not playing the game, that's self destruction.\n* Hyunji reasserts that it's not a big deal, but XS is still irritated and asks why. She says it was to survive since they have 0 points. Dex and Hyunji start laughing. XS says that they need coins to survive and they just used them recklessly, he asks \"What if we suddenly become idiots because of this?\" (ie. They can't pull off a strategy due to this recklessness)\n* The graphics say \"They don't have enough coins to save the whole alliance.\"\n* Dex says XS should've come quickly and given them a strategy or something instead of acting by himself, and that they're on 0 points just waiting for him.\n* Jinho says that Seungjin's disruption made them disorganised and YunB got his way with a bold strategy using that chance. Jinho says he told everyone in R2 that they had to choose between playing solo or pushing someone into 1st, and that was when Hyunji used 6 coins. After that, pushing 1st wasn't an option, so he said they had to play solo now.\n* We see a flashback where he says this to Dex and Hyunji and they acknowledge it. Dex says he'll burn some more coins then. Jinho says they don't really need to talk anymore. Dex makes a really funny face lmao.\n* XS says they split up too early.\n* Confessionals: XS is still frustrated, saying that him and Jinho were trying to avoid last, but they just acted in their own interest. have to try and avoid last on their own. Dex is upset that after being told to play solo, he was being chided for wasting his own coins. Jinho asserts his point that Seungjin's trolling broke down communications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVideo 3:\n\n* YunB is in the big group and says Pi made a blunder.\n* YunB suddenly addresses XS and asks \"Humanely, please don't make me last.\" XS is really confused.\n* YunB says \"You're trying to make me last right now, no?\" XS says yes, obviously. YunB says it's been revealed that he's not in 1st. Xitsuh asks why he should care because it was his own strategy.\n* XS is frustrated at how YunB is asking people to be \"humane\", and asks if what Seungjin did to him was humane.\n* YunB just goes \"...Okay.\" He stomps off and complains to Jinhyeong/Pi that they're pushing him into last. XS follows him out.\n* YunB asks Pi if she can speak for him (not sure, but I think he's basically asking her to plead with Xitsuh to save him).\n* XS says that whoever comes last is the result of the game and they were making someone else come last with their plan too.\n* YunB says he and Pi need to talk. Pi acknowledges that it was wrong to share YunB's numbers without permission.\n* XS asks \"What about when Seungjin stole my notebook without permission?\" He tells YunB that he needs to start talking sense. He asks why people need his permission to share information in Game of Blood.\n* YunB says he just needs to talk to Pi and wants XS to give him some time.\n* XS says Pi is trying to survive. YunB says he knows, and XS asks why he's saying all that extra stuff now.\n* Pi says that she wasn't trying to make YunB last. YunB asks \"So are you saying I have to just humbly accept this?\" Pi says no, and says XS asked her to hold off on getting 10 points to help make YunB last. XS admits this and Pi says she said no to him.\n* XS is quiet and looks intensely as he clicks his pen. He asks if she's just doing her best to survive (I think implying that Pi is lying about turning down XS's request).\n* XS explains what happened earlier with YunB talking about being \"humane\" and that if the game was meant to be humane, he would've stormed out, but it's a game so he stomached it all.\n* YunB comes back to acknowledging their deal and asks him to respect his own deal with Pi. XS says that's Pi's decision to make and he agrees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVideo 4:\n\n* While Jinho and Knucks are in the DM, players wait in their rooms.\n* Pi tells Jinhyeong that Hyunji suddenly came to her with a deal that they wouldn't pick each other if either came last.\n* A flashback shows Hyunji making the offer. Pi suddenly asks if Hyunji has lots of money, and Hyunji is confused. Pi seems to be angling to see if she can make a deal for money as well.\n* Cutting back, Jinhyeong suggests asking her for 20k for each of them.\n* Hyunji and XS come up with snacks. XS thanks them for being loyal today.\n* Jinhyeong says after tonight there'll be 8 left, after starting with 10 (11 technically). Jinhyeong says he was happy when she came back. Pi says she was too, but that was when she started being on the backfoot.\n* People were really suspicious of her when she returned, asking if she sent Xitsuh away (while she was in a hotel). XS and Jinhyeong praise her, saying she survived a long time and made it to the top 8.\n* Pi wants to wash up, but Hyunji thinks they might have to go up after the DM in the same clothes as before. Pi and XS say it doesn't matter.\n* Jinhyeong says Hyunji really seems like a model now, surprising Hyunji. XS asks if he seems like a rapper. Jinhyeong says no, disappointing XS.\n* Pi says Jinhyeong seems like a computer with a few errors.\n* XS says they (Jinhyeong/Pi) have good chemistry. She throws a bag at Jinhyeong and tells him to throw it out.\n* Jinhyeong says he doesn't think you can confidently say anyone is the definite favourite in the DM, using Yurisa as an example.\n* XS says Jinho is different, and he's never seen anyone play as flawlessly (\"without cracks\") as him. He's confident, but Jinho always has everything figured out before XS even opens his mouth. Whenever XS finds a weakness, Jinho explains how it's already accounted for or how he considered it but it's not worth worrying about due to unlikelihood. One of his jobs is to spell check and poke holes in Jinho's plan to see if there are any flaws Jinho hasn't considered.\n* XS thinks Jinho will just win, even if it's an unfavourable game.\n* Hyunji adds that usually they have to simulate the games to understand them, but XS and Jinho understand instantly and already start thinking up scenarios.\n* We cut to Seungjin in his bedroom, then YunB and Dex in their room.\n* YunB tells Dex they need to reshuffle the alliances. They make some comic references, but they say: Jinho going to the DM is the first stage or something and that Knucks is in a good position.\n* We cut to Pi/Hyunji/XS. XS asks if YunB explained why he's sticking to that side, whether he's said the Jinho team looks too tight so he has to do this or something. Pi says that seems to be the case.\n* XS says he wasn't sure whether YunB was actually betraying them or just acting last episode (E7). Jinho said they should sit back and watch. XS was worried about leaving the pool alliance alone as they mess with the team, but they ended up \"helping\" the pool alliance while thwarting their plans and playing dumb. He says YunB did well.\n* Pi asks if the group knew where all the symbols were on the day of the ambush. XS says yes, Pi presumes they were told (by the producers), Hyunji clarifies that they figured it out. YunB and Jinhyeong come in. Hyunji says YunB knew 2.\n* XS says he suspected the thing in the living room was the symbol because it matched the symbol on the rule book.\n* Hyunji is sleepy after eating so much, but she's happy eating ramen every day. Pi asks if models have calorie restrictions, but YunB and Hyunji say that there's more freedom now, so long as you fit in the clothes. Hyunji says there are mandatory doctor visits in France so your BMI can't be too low.\n* XS says his BMI is low (182cm, 67kg) and asks if he can be a model, Hyunji says models are 188cm and 68kg. Hyunji knows a 192cm guy who was 58kg at his lightest, but it was just his lifestyle.\n* Everyone come to the main hall.\n* Jinho says it was tough. Hyunji says \"Really? If it was hard enough to make you say that...\" And everyone is worried.\n* Knucks and YunB share some platitudes, Knucks says it took longer than expected. YunB asks if it was a prolonged war.",

It's not him that's better, it's just that these people esp YunB was smoking something. The way he acted like Pi killed his whole family was a sight to behold. What Hyunji did to Jinho was esentially the same, and while paying betrayal with kindness is not normal (Jinho), YunB's gaslighting is not normal either lol.",

                            "comment": "Summ of some important points (sorry if you want more details/small talks TL you might have to wait for someone else): \n\nFirst, Hyunji tried to strike a deal with Pi of not choosing each other for death matches, in a true Pi\u2019s fashion she is okay but ask for money. Pi says to Jinhyung that instead of using her brain, she knows she can only do these kinda things (her way). \n\nSecond (4 ppl scene), Jinhyung says he think there\u2019s no absolute (to be winners) in death matches , after all Yurisa also lost one. Seo Chulgu cut him/Pie off, saying he thinks Hong Jinho is a different case. Chulgu explained that he was confident himself, but it\u2019s his first time meeting such an invincible player like Jinho. He gives a rundown of their usual play: \u201cChulgu, here\u2019s the plan, pls check for loopholes/ mistakes\u201d \u201cHyung, there\u2019s  this&amp;that\u201d \u201cOh Chulgu I\u2019ve thought about that don\u2019t worry, so it\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u201d  and repeat. Basically Chulgu says that Jinho has thought through every possibilities &amp; counters. Hyunji notes how players (like herself) is just working hard to understand the game during the introduction vid, but KongChul is already working out plans during that time. \n\nThird, YunB and Dex is relating the situation to One Piece. Saying Hong Jinho is like Kaido (for non weeb, Kaido\u2019s full title is \u2018Kaido of the Beasts, The Strongest Creature\u2019, this should give enough ref). And Nux is like Aokiji (a very strong marine admiral, keep in mind that One Piece is about pirates against marines). \n\nMy comment: \n\nLMAO Pi money grubbing way is so funny, her and Hyunji\u2019s meticulousness is so interesting to me. Pi\u2019s self awareness of what she can do is exactly why I don\u2019t hate playaers like her and Hyunji (not talking about Money Game Pi who went overboard). \n\nNotice how during Seo Chulgu\u2019s fanboying session, Lee Jinhyung slowly close his eyes and lays down haha and only opens up when they stopped talking about Jinho\u2019s play. Anyway Xitsuh does a very good job impersonating Jinho, and it\u2019s cool how Jinho always gives himself the benefit of doubt.  I remember how Sungjoo thought Jinho had self confidence and went for the first 2 rounds in the 74 game but in reality he actually was saying how it\u2019s burdensome. Please never change your humility, Kong. \n\nYunB sure is working hard lol, idk if people are overthinking or not but some says that he chose One Piece on purpose to get closer to Dex who likes Anime lol. If it really is true then it\u2019s working very well as Dex seemed passive before the mention of One Piece, afther YunB brought up One Piece something lighted up in his eyes lol. Why do real life marines always seem to love a story about pirate king so much? As I\u2019ve also used One Piece in comparison to Bloody Game before I\u2019m just happy it\u2019s now meta, though Jinho is Luffy in my heart.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m also adding this to the post.",

I understand 100% where Hyunji is coming from and she's right that they're a threat. Dex seems to have blind trust in Hyunji :/ not gonna say anything about him anymore. Seo Chulgu is often times right but he really needs to work on his temper lol he goes off like a firecracker and make people dismiss his point out of anger. Hong Jinho is just tired haha.\n\nSubjectively, I'm just glad Jinho's team (HJ) betrayed him first so I can cheer for him with a lightheart. I hope Jinho and Xitsuh can survive until the end as they feared. \n\nWell, Ha seungjin's one man opera really worked lol the miscommunication snowballed into this.",

He gambled without consulting the wild team and stopped pie at a crucial moment when Jinho and Xitsuh were mentally disturbed by Seungjin.

Or is the PD cherry picking Hyunji's scene for her image? It's getting suspicious since it's hers again lol. I wouldn't be surprised if they do that for Hyunji since she's a big name in her own industry. \n\nMeanwhile the butt of the joke had been someone like Lee Jinhyung who is a non celebrity. I dismissed the missing elaboration for Lee Jinhyung's calculation in that ep as the PDs not making it too game/math heavy since many of the K watchers seems to like cheap conflicts not the game itself.  But now that I see it, could have just been them giving Jinhyung no room to explain. \n\nIf only spectators didn't take shits like this to heart and witchhunt people for such shows maybe they wouldn't need to do shady shits like this.",

He realized the other team is close to finishing the game, so it doesn't matter how many coins he saved or the rest of the team members saved, all of them will be useless once the game ends in the next round. So he decided to waste the coins himself and he tried to do something about it instead of simply giving up like Jinho and Xitsuh and it worked. If you feed this data to a computer, it will probably tell you this is the best strategic move one can do at the time. Dex sensed the danger and he instinctively know he had to go all in, it's just he didn't know how to explain it technically in numbers, so he used the word gamble.

Even if his bid happened to be the right move (which I don't think we know, and you can't just declare that it is because \"a computer would probably say so\"), it wouldn't make Dex's actions \"the most logical move\" because he clearly wasn't thinking about it that hard and just decided to take a gut shot. You can call it instinct or whatever, but as the above commenter says, it's not a \"smart\" move.",

Dex knows exactly, they wouldn't allow it, that's why he didn't ask. Jinho and Xitsuh tried everything for many rounds and failed every time they had nothing new to add to this game at that point and Dex saw their teammate's poor play and decided to take the matter in his own hand and won the round otherwise the game was about to finish in next round if no one stopped pie now. He know's it's about time to make a bold move and took a different approach and it worked.  Most player's can't play like this, they would hesitate to go all in, even at times when that is the only move to survive.\n\nJinho is a poker player so he must've run the play after the game and realized Dex made the right call that's why Jinho praised him highly.\n\nAfter that round Jinho started playing like Dex and bet 19 coins in single round if you don't understand the game why Dex and Jinho bet much higher bets it looks stupid but it's the only best move anyone could play. And the moment Dex dropped 13 coins is pure genius but the people who couldn't digest the fact he played so brilliantly than Jinho and Xitsuh don't agree. It's okay Jinho approves it and I see Korean forums full of praises for Dex's play. I know you're a Dex hater so your comment is not a surprise.\n\nEdit: Actually, this is not the first time Dex recognizes a crucial moment. In the first team battle just before the end, Dex said it's okay to lose now with smaller numbers to get a higher number just to avoid a draw scenario and Jinho agreed. Jinho originally wanted to win that round but changed after thinking about what Dex said and they eventually won with his plan in the end.",

I don't take Jinho at his word when he calls players smart because he has played with some absolute morons that he has praised as being good players because that's the kind of guy he is.\n\nDon't try and flip flop between the idea that Jinho was so bad at the game that Dex had to step in and save him and then that Jinho is so smart that his praise of Dex in this game is proof of how Dex was a genius. You're just twisting facts and contradicting yourself to make Dex look as good as possible. Call me a hater all you want, but you're the one that thinks making a 13 coin bid off a random hunch is \"pure genius\" lmao.",

I don\u2019t think anyone can say Dex is not brain smart mainly because we haven\u2019t had a chance to see if he is or not. If I had someone like Jinho and Xitsuh on my team who obviously have skills to lead in any type of brain or analytical type challenge, I would step back and let them do it. Otherwise you have \u201ctoo many cooks in the kitchen\u201d and that can make an even bigger disaster. I think in the next two episodes we will be able to see who has \u201cthe smarts\u201d to keep up and who doesn\u2019t.

He even did cursing and punched the door. He is a super loyal player. The main reason he got elimininated in season 1 because he couldn't catch up with the brain game with all other contestant. He was kind of lost and made silly mistakes, and didn't understand a single thing in the game.",

I will say out of all the alliances I have seen in different variety shows (there are still many I have not seen) this alliance is by far my favorite. I have always seen Jinho and Dex as co captains. I agree with Dex letting his emotions take over. Maybe he will be able to pivot and adjust how he lets it affect him if or when he does more survival shows.",

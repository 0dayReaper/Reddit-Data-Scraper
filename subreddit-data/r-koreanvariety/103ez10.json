    "postText": "As a follow up to the other discussion about best cast additions, I thought it might be interesting to hear your thoughts about the **most impactful cast departures both in terms of losses and wins**. This is probably only applicable to any longer running shows.\n\nI guess my first thoughts and quite obvious ones regarding losses are Lee Kwang-Soo leaving RM and Lee Si-Eon leaving ILA. Imo RM has been doing quite alright since then but in some episodes it's quite apparent that a LKS-esque character would have balanced it out better. In the case of ILA it felt like a huge loss to me when Si-Eon left and with it the best \"commentator\" as well as the glue between the members / \"guy-to-bounce-off-of\". Only recently has the show started getting closer to previous levels again.\n\nWhat are your thoughts and picks?",

Mostly it became a talk show nowadays. Can't blame them tho, the cast members are getting old. Nonetheless, RM remains a good variety show.",

I mean that as no offense. \n\nBecause you seem to forget that Running Man had become pretty bad even before Gary left. For at least a year before he left, the episodes were quite mediocre most of the time. The cast dynamics had become stale and most of the cast weren't trying.\n\nThe addition of two new member created whole new sets of dynamics to explore for 1-2 years which imho saved the show from being cancelled. It breathed fresh life into the show (sadly at the moment the cast is back to being bland and repetitive)",

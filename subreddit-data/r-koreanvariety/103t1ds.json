    "postText": " **EXO**\u2019s **D.O.**, **Zico**, **Crush**, Jannabi\u2019s **Choi Jung Hoon**, **Lee Yong Jin**, And **Yang Se Chan** will all be gracing the stage of SBS\u2019s new variety show!\n\nOn December 4, a source from SBS said in confirmation, \u201cIt is true that D.O., Zico, Crush, Choi Jung Hoon, Lee Yong Jin, and Yang Se Chan will be appearing on SBS\u2019s new variety show.\u201d\n\nD.O., Zico, and Crush are particularly well-known for being close friends. This program will highlight that friendship while bringing in Choi Jung Hoon to the group as well. All four celebrities were born between 1992 and 1993, so their similarity in age is expected to be just one more point that will bring them closer together.\n\nThey will also be appearing beside comedians Lee Yong Jin and Yang Se Chan, so viewers can get excited for lots of fun and even more laughs.\n\nWhile the title of the variety show is yet to be decided, it has been revealed that former \u201c**Running Man**\u201d producer Choi Bo Pil will be taking charge of this new program!\n\nThe program will air sometime in March. Stay tuned for updates!\n\nSource: [https://www.soompi.com/article/1561392wpp/exos-d-o-zico-crush-yang-se-chan-and-more-confirmed-to-appear-on-new-sbs-variety-show](https://www.soompi.com/article/1561392wpp/exos-d-o-zico-crush-yang-se-chan-and-more-confirmed-to-appear-on-new-sbs-variety-show)",

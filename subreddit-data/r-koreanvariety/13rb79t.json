But given the right situation, he'll be the funniest person in the world. During 1 Night 2 Days Season 3  he really saved me going through tough times with his funny moments. And besides being funny he's just an overall good person, his passion for comedy and his community cannot be beaten. \n\nAt the other end I have Lee Seojin, who tries so hard not to try but still ends up endearingly funny lol. Even winning tvN only Vadiety Daesang so far lmao. His whole variety saga starting from his meeting with Na PD in 1 Night 2 Days Season 1 is just comedy in its own. His every move becomes a variety show idea for Na PD's team and it's meta at its best.\n\nThe two polar opposites are just irreplaceable in my heart.\n\nObjectively though I'd say Lee Sugeun is Korea's most consistent comedian.",

I remember my first introduction to him was Roommates and I thought he was kinda sweet, kinda corny and then I\u2019d see more and more of him on other shows: mostly Happy Together. I think it\u2019s because when I didn\u2019t really enjoy his presence when I watched him on WGM and when he eventually joined IC I don\u2019t think I gave him as much of a chance as I gave Kwanghee because I was so over it",

It\u2019s like HaHa, he is a rapper and a performer but he is also a TV personality and was on two of the biggest variety shows, IC and RM and is surrounded by comedians.",

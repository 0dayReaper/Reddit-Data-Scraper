    "postText": "Recently watched episode 74 of shooting stars and noticed both streaming services edited out a certain scene. I have been using Kocowa up to this point and now i'm worried they have been editing stuff the whole time. Spoilers for ep 74 below\n\n&gt;!I had to do a double take reading the old discussion post on here following the match in episode 74. Multiple people were referencing a ref intervention between Kyung-hee and Hye-jung and I never saw it during the game. I rewinded all the way through and never saw what they were talking about. I checked viki and same thing never saw the scene mentioned. Not until I checked the typical reupload streaming sites did I see that they both completely edited out the \"tussle\" from the match where Hye-jung was whining. Had me pretty annoyed because I have watched all 74 episodes on Kocowa and if they have been editing things the whole time id rather just watch on kshow or something where they dont edit. Anyone else noticed edits on these services I might have missed?!&lt;",

Most recent example I can think of is in HDYP, there was a company office musical at the end of the episode that was flat out removed.\n\nIf you are going to watch shows on the first day they come out, it's probably okay to watch on kocowa/viki, but otherwise it's more guaranteed if you watch elsewhere.",

Noticed they cut out really small parts out discussions from the original recording after trying to time subtitles to the broadcast version. First i thought it was weird when the subtitles kept going off. Had to re-time it a couple of times. After playing the 2 videos next to each other i found out they cut out multiple small frames/scene's. It did seem random to me. For example a scene/frame of the food and some members reaction dialogue. No idea why they do it. Can understand that netflix is butchering Knowing Bros by removing all the music and replacing it with elevator music because they don't want to pay for that to. But editing HyeMiLeeYeChaePa that way seemed random to me. Im sure they have a good reason i dont know about.",

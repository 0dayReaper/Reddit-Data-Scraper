This is an easy yes from me even if there aren't subs (tho if that's the case, I pray Bumdidlyumptious will take up the mantle). Also, the Genius font and style plus the way the article is worded has me thinking it will be more than just your average survival show. I'm carefully but very optimistically hyped.",

I do love such episodes, where members have to work together and overcome a challenge.",

Members try to initiate conversation and events, as they are not sure from where more entertaining content might be generated. I also feel they do not hate the penalty, since penalty gives them chance to create more content for another episode.\n\nI have seen LKS wagering ridiculous bets on RM. I cheered him on, as I felt he was kind of the underdog. I used to think, why is he being so ridiculous, he could have won medium amount easily but he wagered it all for better reward. But winning was never his intention, creating entertainment content was.",

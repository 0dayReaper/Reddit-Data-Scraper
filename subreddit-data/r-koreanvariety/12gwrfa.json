However, if he were to find himself in a country on the other side of the world where they don\u2019t know anything about Korean food, will he be able to run a business and survive? In a place where he doesn\u2019t speak the language and has no popularity to rely on, he must build a business from the ground up. Nothing is scripted and everything is one-hundred percent real. Will Paik Jong Won be able to reach world-class fame with his food business?

            "comment": "Oof that was a rough watch. I understand how cultural differences and jealousy at how great Baek Jong Won is at this kind of business could cause a lot of issues but given how they've kinda just thrown BJW into the deep end, the staff really should've been on the ball and prepared more thoroughly. Having a backup location seemed obvious to me but luckily they found that all women's shop to lend it for a few days. \n\nAlso, like others have said, they could at least minimize some of these concerns by always having a translator and by reassuring the locals through more obvious means. In fact, I thought the part-timer was someone who was hired beforehand by the staff for the whole duration in Morocco but not letting her know and have her be there at the new place immediately feels like a big oversight considering without her, they can't communicate properly. These issues coupled with how the staff tries to let BJW handle most of the problems feels like I'm watching a ship slowly sink and burn. I get they want a more genuine experience with BJW at the forefront but since it's a show first and foremost, they should've done thorough research on the area and at least caution him on potential issues so he has a more time to come up with solutions or alternatives.\n\nAt this point, I'm happy they'll be filming at another place after this because as much as I love checking out Morocco's culture, it doesn't currently seem to be a good fit for BJW despite his valiant efforts otherwise. A lot of these issues are out of the scope of his expertise and as such, I worried if he continued with it there, he might be highly put off doing his shows abroad in the future. Hopefully, with a bit more cast to help out and a new change in location after this, we would get less frustrating and anxiety-inducing scenes. Here's to hoping these are just teething issues and the staff and cast will learn from this and do better down the road.",

One question that kept coming to mind was\u2026 couldn\u2019t the cast have learnt some basic Arabic or French? The ending segment where they were taking orders and serving customers was pretty frustrating to watch. \n\nI agree that much of the \u201cfailure\u201d seemed to me a lack of research and foresight of the local environment by the producers. \n\nStill, I am continuing to root for them and am looking forward to the next episodes!",

It was a definite eye opener for the korean production team. \n\nI highly doubt it was about the halal food. Their local supermarkets, butcher and vegetable sellers do not sell non-halal ingredients for obvious reasons. Even the subsequent argument about people getting sick from eating somewhere else was illogical. \n\nFrom some countries I had visited, many of the touristy areas and businesses are managed by or run by gangs. Business owners have to pay them. \n\nThe production team obviously would apply for legal, halal and any other permits and had received permission from the authorities. However, there are many \u201claws\u201d of the land, legit or not, and some even interconnected. \n\nFrom the sudden cut off in their electricity and the expression and general lack of action of Baek\u2019s local male part timer and his abrupt disappearance, to the \u201chalal discussion\u201d and the camera person probably being made to put down their camera but secretly filmed from their thigh level for security reasons, I can postulate that the gangsters that run the market were probably trying to intimidate the production members into paying a bribe. \n\nWhen the intimidation started at the stall itself, you can see an experienced Baek changing his expression, demeanour and body language as he did not want to show fear. Even when he was scouting out the local area upon his arrival, you can see that he does not get taken in by the many \u201coverly friendly\u201d young male touts nor get scammed. As an idol, Bam Bam is less experienced than Baek with the real world obviously. Not every tout is your friend. I am glad the Baek team did not have a young female celebrity with them at this point. \n\nThe next day at breakfast, it was obvious the celebs were anxious but they only showed it in a subtle way. It would have been wise to hire some bodyguards if they were going to film in hostile areas. Some countries allow you to pay for police protection or escorts. \n\nNot every location is going to be as friendly as depicted in Youn\u2019s Kitchen, Jinny\u2019s Kitchen, Korean Hostel in Spain etc. The Korean production teams are probably rewriting their SOP and rule books as we speak. \n\nKudos to the Genius Paik\u2019s team for scrambling to find an alternative location and the celebs for keeping their heads about them. Glad they were physically unharmed. Hope they don\u2019t ever film in hostile areas. As a general rule of thumb, if a woman feels unsafe walking around in an area alone, the place is hostile.",

            "comment": "If restauranteur Baek knew about Bam Bam throwing away the mother and son's food by mistake, Baek would have either given them replacement burgers or comped their food. In F&amp;B, servers should ask customers if they have finished and could clear their plates, instead of clearing them when the customers' backs were turned during a short conversation. I felt bad because 40 dirhams are nothing for a Korean TV station but are a lot for Moroccans in an area where a simple street snack costs 1 dirham. The customers were nice and knew they were filmed but it is only fair to be comped for the server's mistake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring another scene when the Koreans were walking in the streets, some local men made comments like \"they eat frogs\". Frog meat is considered haram ie. non halal, condemned and forbidden according to Islamic law. It is also another way to label the Koreans as Chinese as the latter are known as frog meat eaters. In many street scenes, the Koreans were also called out as Chinese. It is not too much of a stretch to say some scenes showed the xenophobia faced by the Koreans in Morocco.",

Probably used concern that the food isn't legit Halal as a weapon to shut them down. The \"anonymous complaint\" was probably another stall owner. \"Because the night market is a famous destination, there\u2019s a lot of concerns about the unfamiliar non-Muslim food\" is another way of saying \"You're not welcome here foreigners\" by the local stall owners who don't want competition. Racism/xenophobia along with good old fashioned greedy and morally corrupt tactics to ruin your competition in the name of \"tradition\", \"safety\" and things like these. What a bunch of BS. \n\nThen the \"complaint\" makers argument was total BS. \"WHAT IF, WHAT IF THEY EAT SOMETHING BAD AND THEN GO TO YOUR PLACE AND EAT SOMETHING AND THEN BLAME YOU? WHO TAKES RESPONSIBILITY THEN?!\" lmao. Okay, so I guess no foreigner making fusion or foreign food can ever open a stall? Hell, how does any restaurant or stall operate? If you fear someone blaming your food for them being sick when it was really something they ate earlier, that can happen to any food selling business anywhere. That's part of doing business. What a load of horse shit. Faux concern on your behalf, trying to \"protect\" you by shutting you down so the locals can keep business as usual going. Mafia tactics. F off greedy scumbags (which exist in every country and these tactics are used by every countries locals, sadly). \n\nThe Koreans IRL and online have it right to bitch about this and the Islamic/Moroccan netizens have no leg to stand on other than na\u00efvely thinking it's actually about food safety/Halal certification. In reality what should be happening is Morocco should be embarrassed and apologizing on behalf of their globally famous market stall owners, and possibly officials, being petty and using fake concern about Halal-certification to shut a foreigners business down because it was popular. I would assume the stall owners doing this is blasphemy/sacrilege considering Halal is followed for Holy reasons.  So they used their religion as a weapon to hurt competition in business. Big no no. \n\nIt would have been super easy to have either of the local-hired employees who speak the language explain that all the ingredients they were using and how all of them are 100% Halal and from the local market. \n\nHow you attempt to avoid this, I think, is by going overboard with making everyone know it's 100% Halal. A printed stamp on the menu isn't going to quash the concerns of locals. They should have had the menu up with all the ingredients listed and even where they came from (so \"Beef bought from \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ shop on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ street\") so they see all the ingredients and see that it was all bought locally. Then if they don't trust it, they will never trust it, and so you can't win them over no matter what. \n\nI am not surprised at all that it was women owners of a shop that happily allowed them to rent the location. An unfortunate reality is you're going to get that more close minded, territorial and xenophobic attitude from the status quo (men) owners but you're more likely to get a positive response from another minority group (even if it's just women) who have experienced their own struggles due to glass ceilings and territorial status-quo male owners. Due to that they sympathize and are more open.",

Worst of all they use their religion, sacrilegiously, as their tool to sabotage the foreigners stall. Hypocrites and bringing shame to their faith/God and country. In this case, on TV. Smart job Moroccans...\n\nI don't want to even know what they are saying. Especially because it has to be guaranteed moronic given the fact the show very diligently showed the cast sourcing all of their foods from the local market. The show itself literally shows you it's all 100% Halal and local. The same ingredients that the other stalls serving food use. So the Koreans did it 100% right, put up signs making it clear it's all 100% Halal and yet Moroccans defend shutting them down and effectively kicking them out? GTFOH.",

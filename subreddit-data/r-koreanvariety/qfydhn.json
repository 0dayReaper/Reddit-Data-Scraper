I am not his fan.\n\nI too was appalled at Kim Seon Ho just days ago but these articles and their backing with evidence deserve to be read.\n\nIf you have the time, I ask that you read the articles. And I hope you don't take offense to any of my claims.\n\nI mean no harm, and I will take this post down if that is what the moderators or members of the subreddit would like.\n\n[AllKpop](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2021/10/dispatch-questions-the-validity-of-the-claims-made-by-kim-seon-hos-ex-girlfriend-reveals-kim-seon-ho-cooked-seaweed-soup-after-learning-of-the-pregnancy)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Koreaboo/status/1452821618007298056?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)\n\n[Soompi](https://www.soompi.com/article/1495362wpp/dispatch-reveals-details-about-kim-seon-ho-and-his-ex-girlfriends-relationship)",

I now err to the side that Seonho is not some psychopath, manipulator but he did decide to go for abortion(we dunno if it was forced tho) so he still felt guilty about the situation. The most baffling thing tho is his company never defending him, they only defended themselves loll.\n \nWell ofc i have my biases cos i really liked him in 2d1n. Hope the truth prevails whatever it is.",

It's riskly because a lot of people might only hear/care about the initial scandal, but fighting with your ex over public statements is not sympathetic even if you are innocent. Waiting with this report was imo also smart - it is even more impactful now that we know a single conversation was enough for the ex to publicaly forgive him.",

It's not an offensive statement but rather a defensive one, so it is not like he is fighting with his ex. A lot of people, like you said, only hear about the initial allegations and don't end up reading the clarifications so I think it is a really risky gamble, especially if you look at the number of times false allegations ruined someone's career even when they were proven in the end to be false.",

Soompi posted about it so you can check the details there. \n\nBut yeah, agreed, it's a personal fight. Since it's a private aspect of his life that was shared to the public without his consent, he doesn't owe any of us an explanation. It was the ex-gf's choice to be vulgar and assassinate his character in front of gossip-hungry netizens, who likewise relished hating on him after a single anonymous post. \n\nNo one should live like they have to explain themselves all the time. If we want to think bad about someone, then that burden is entirely on us. And pseudo feminists who were quick to brand the people who defended him or didn't take sides as \"oppalogists\" and \"disgusting\" should also reflect on themselves.",

Plus, having a relationship and lead to abortion, it tends to have a bad look in public eyes, it doesn\u2019t matter that both sides agree or not.\n\nAnd if KSH comes out and explain himself, it would not add any better. The public will take that KSH is bad mouthing his ex-gf who goes through abortion and she might not stand a chance anymore.\n\nSo saying sorry and instead of fight over a relationship goes bad is better.\n\nIt\u2019s just that KSH is a celebrity on the raise so it blows up so fast.",

I followed some of his fan sites so from what I've gathered, public opinion has greatly shifted in his favour thanks to this one kind move from Dispatch. Several CF deals that were archived after the scandal blew up have now been restored. He still has 1 film in the works, *Sad Tropics,* but the production's going to be delayed a bit to give him time. HomeCha crew and actors are writing posts of support for him too. Not to mention 2 of ex-gf's friends defended Seonho. So I guess that says a lot.\n\nI agree saying \"sorry\" for something he's not guilty of isn't exactly the right thing to do ('cause idiots actually misconstrued it for actual \"guilt\"). But this is more about his character than it is about the typical Korean culture of apologising to appease the public. I mean, if telling his story to the public would only pain him some more, I'd rather he does it in his own time, at his own pace. Give or take 3-6 months before he gets back on his feet. Never have I seen an actor who got the media, youtubers, crewmates and private people working so hard to save his reputation. And if there's one thing Koreans are crazy about, it's public opinion.",

So it doesn't matter that he's ruined, cause Salt won't be paying anyway and now, KSH will have a hard time jumping ship until he makes a comeback. \n\nOf course, Salt has [denied this](https://www.soompi.com/article/1495233wpp/kim-seon-hos-agency-reveals-further-details-of-actors-contract-following-rumors) and clarified that his contract had already been extended last year, and that they didn't orchestrate this whole ordeal. Comments are probably cherry-picked by netizenbuzz, but here are some [reactions](https://twitter.com/notnetizenbuzz/status/1452846336076705792?s=20) to that.\n\nMany anonymous \"acquaintances\" have been speaking up for KSH over the past few days, and to be honest, I wasn't inclined to believe them but now, they have Dispatch backing them up. This whole issue is honestly such a mess and it's hard to get a clear picture with all the articles popping up. Even Korean sentiments are heavily mixed. In the end, the damage has been done... and I guess, his private life's just not our business.",

They said they'd made the decision not based on reputation but reliability, and that he had handled the crisis with zero professionalism and maturity.\n\nI think it was right to keep quiet to the public (or they'd have just dug their grave deeper) and let Dispatch do the dirty work, but they could still have communicated with the production and CF companies.

They just privated the YouTube videos or archived their social media posts bc both the agency and the actor didn\u2019t reply to them and were ghosted. They have contracts that say they should be notified immediately or before any scandal arises, so honestly considering all of the results, they have given him more than enough benefit of the doubt by not terminating immediately. The agency handled it so poorly, now fans are trying to cancel the brands that dropped him. Honestly this doesn\u2019t harm the brands in the long run as much as fans might think, it only harms the actor bc less brands in the future will want to work with him/on the dramas he\u2019s in (bc of his crazy fanbase/too high of a risk for the return, and due to the agency not responding). I just feel bad now for the other artists at the ent agency bc they will likely be blacklisted bc of their agency\u2019s poor management in this situation from both the brands/companies and the marketing firms/advertising agencies.\n\nEdit: typo",

Celebrities are principally being brought down in China because the Communist Party wants to limit/eliminate celebrities influence on public, they want to be sole influence. That is not something we should applaud. \n\nAs for Korea, I think serious criminal activity, violence are legitimate reasons to criticize someone in the public eye, but things like celebrities dating, having a baby like Chen from Exo, or Bobby from Ikon, or having an abortion take place are not reasonable reasons to cancel celebrities. The moral bar is too high. \n\nI prefer a society when a 100 guilty men go free than one where one innocent person is punished unjustly. \n\nUS society is improving and the likelihood of an R Kelly type or Harvey Weinstein getting away with things for decades is unlikely. \n\nAs for Chris Brown if the domestic violence incident had not happened he would be a much bigger star than he is today.

It is also amazing. All of the internet in the west is private - it is not publicly owned. That gives them a right to censor if you want to call it that, just as a newspaper does not print everything that is sent to them. Certainly posting facts and truths has helped in many instances. And posting lies and unsubstantiated opinions has caused a lot of damage. Is it very much different than when there was only one radio station and that was the main source of information? Weren't the 'masses' also controlled then? Have you watched the Social Dilemma?",

It\u2019s not Seonho\u2019s fault that her initial actions gave Dispatch an opening to scrutinize what she wrote and come up with a comprehensive report complete with statements from her own friends in order to provide a better context as to why and how things came to be between them. \n\nWhat I\u2019m getting from his ex is that she wrote the post the way she did because she expected Seonho to panic and try to save his ass by responding to every single claim she put out there, but he didn\u2019t. People don\u2019t have to believe Seonho\u2019s completely innocent because he obviously had major lapses in judgment as well, but it\u2019s a little dumb to vilify him for taking the best course of action he could think for himself, and for that said action to work in his favor. He only apologized, rather vaguely at that too - if the woman decided to accept that quickly with her trying to fan out the flames caused by her expos\u00e9, therefore giving some people room to doubt and Dispatch a reason to research on it further, that\u2019s on her. \n\nIf anything, the woman is more than welcome to defend herself and release counter arguments, or even have another media outlet pull a Dispatch on the other camp. But that\u2019s a tricky course of action to make at this point. Yes she managed to destroy his career, but she played her cards all at once and a little too early. I don\u2019t think Seonho and his camp should be faulted for how they managed to turn some things around because to be honest, the way his ex initially dealt with this issue did give them a chance to resolve this in a way they think will work for him best.",

The fact that he still has a movie to film in December is astounding enough for a controversial figure.\n\nA journalist even apologized for escalating his case so drastically. On Naver, there's always a positive article of him trending in the entertainment section. The general public pretty much acknowledges how wrongful this scandal was for him.\n\nI think the subsection of haters he has right now will never go away though. Some chronically online K-netz are still mean to him and some tried to boycott 11Street for reinstating his ads. Funnily enough, for the first day of 11Street's '2021 11th Festival', the transaction amount increased by 40% compared to last year. We can surmise that the hateful K-netz don't really have a significant effect on him anymore, since the companies that kept him were trending in the top 10 of 11Street's real-time shopping query. In fact, after Edition Sensibility reinstated his advertisements, they shot up to #1 on 11Street.\n\nLast time, I said that many of his fans were older women. There are K-netz calling his fans Zoomas or Joomas because they're buying every endorsement he has (think: sugar mommy implications. I wonder how he got these many older fans?). These hateful K-netz obviously will never change their minds, no matter what new article pops up. It's part of celebrity culture. \n\nI side-eyed his fans for tagging his case as 'Cancelling Cancel Culture', that was corny as hell, but lol... he kind of did it. I don't think it'll be the same for the proceeding celebrities who'd get caught up in scandals though. I theorize it's just him, but who knows?",

Like, yes, the ex-gf might be an extremely manipulative, vindictive cheater who is out for revenge, BUT she could still be a victim of a gaslighting tactic that prevents her from ever having children again.\n\nI want to emphasize I'm not taking her or KSH's side, I'm just saying there are no clear villains or heroes in this story, life is much more complex than a kdrama :/ The most important thing is still how the Korean society reacts to this after all, because it's their opinion that matters most to be honest",

The jung joon young ex-girlfriend case really scarred me dude. For all the people who don't know, she came out with her story, his side denied it saying that it was \"consensual only\" and quote:\n\n&gt;The charges were immediately canceled and during the investigation period, the truth was revealed and the case closed. The agency stated that the non-celebrity female impulsively submitted charges after a \u201csmall misunderstanding\u201d with the singer. The case is expected to be wrapped up by the prosecution after the office found no reason to further investigate Jung Joon Young.\n\n(Yes, the same word 'misunderstanding' used in ksh case . I was shook awhile back.)\n\nThen this ex took back the charges since she didn't have much evidence. JJY returned to 2d1n again. 5 years later, jung joon young was jailed due to another scandal and when this ex was asked why she took her statements back, she said:\n\n&gt;\"I\u00a0was afraid I'd be accused of making false accusations and ruin my life. After [his acquittal in 2016], I\u00a0became an official liar and thought about who would even believe me in the future. I should have endured it.\"\n\nJust imagine, if her claims had been taken seriously or if she had been given some initial support for coming out against a public figure(which most people won't do), many girls would have NOT been raped/video-tapped/gang-raped by jjy in those inbetween 5 years. Goosebumps.\n\nIn short, as outsiders we can only speculate. We can't even say some things didn't happen just because a person doesn't have evidence. I hope this case is not used as an example to shame future 'exposers' by saying: *\"Oh it's like ksh case all over again...This is a personal matter...She is lying...We know how good he is on camera and how people praise him etc etc\"* At the end of the day, we redditors are also normal people, and if you, the person reading, had been screwed over by a celebrity- mental, physical or emotional abuse- I would believe you too initially when you come out and give you support at first. Having said that, a part of me does hope miss a original post is not true, because I think ksh would make a comeback soon with most people now believing the ex to be the \"manipulator\" and I would like it to be truthfully justice in a fair world. But honestly, I really don't support any side or believe anyone right now. Peace.",

            "comment": "I understand how frustrated some of the comments are regarding the agency\u2019s response to the new data brewed into this whole fiasco, but try to think of it as this: if you\u2019re an agency who manages one of Korea\u2019s top rising stars, wouldn\u2019t you want to fulfill his wishes?\n\nI\u2019ve been questioning their whole response to the issue but with their official statement, what I get is this: by glossing over the issue of the actor and focusing instead on their agreement with him, it practically should confirm that they\u2019re supporting their actor in the way that the actor wishes. \n\nI mean come on, do people think that in a business standpoint, contracts favor the actors so much that if they are to be caught in a controversy that would result to project losses and brand drops (aka loss of money, penalties) the company is OBLIGED to keep them? I think not. I\u2019m sure agencies are smart enough to weave contracts in a way that foresees the possibility of artists getting into controversies and keeping their losses at a reasonable amount. Remember: agencies get a cut too with how popular their celebrity is and they suffer twice if not more than the artists when things go south.\n\nWith Kim Seon Ho especially, would they be willing to sully their agency\u2019s name purely because of a contract and \u201cloyalty\u201d?  Surely there is a reason why they not only clarified the start of his renewed contract but also detailed an annex of possible extensions IF there are no disagreements (would they be so confident in stating this tiiiny detail if they think telling the whole story won\u2019t be something that will be brought up by Kim Seon Ho when they sit to review their past work and plan for the future?) even after that and that reason is they still have faith in the actor and sees that he is an investment to the company. This whole shebang is nothing more than a rough patch they have to go through. \n\nNow, coming back to the actor\u2019s wishes, when Salt says they have no comments about the newly released article, does that automatically mean they\u2019re dodging it completely? I don\u2019t think so. I think they are respecting their artist\u2019s wishes as to not speak for KSH as he seems to not want to fight in public. In this standpoint, their \u201cstrategy\u201d is to just let the public decide for themselves. It\u2019s, in lack of better terms, safer not only for KSH but for the ex as well. Agency is protecting KSH\u2019s wishes = protecting the girl. \n\nIt\u2019s now up to us to decide with what we have which are all just glimpses of a private life that was never supposed to be out in the first place before it blew up even more and caused damage for the both of them. We are now burdened for peering in, and I don\u2019t think any of the two owe us anything more than what they (and/or the people around them) want to give. \n\nBtw I\u2019m in no way trying to defend SALT but just giving a perspective that I haven\u2019t read so far. We must also try to read between the lines and not take everything as it is.",

But they don't consider that the accused get hate and punishment in the court of public opinion. They lose jobs, relationships, opportunities, etc. And if the accusations are proven false, the accused rarely get back what they lost. That's also damaging and traumatic af. \n\nIt really is best to be neutral in every issue that is vague. These people are not our friends or family. We don't need to say that we support or hate them before anything is proven. Or even after, for that matter. We can empathize or be sensitive when being skeptical but we shouldn't immediately jump on the online hate bandwagon just because we think saying \"I hate this accused person\" is a valuable addition to the conversation.",

Unless there is violence, threats of violence, threats of destitution - as in the woman has no income other than what the male provides, or extreme power imbalance - say the woman had been 20 - it is the woman who has the final decision. It is her choice. The man has every right to express his position on the matter. She takes that information and makes the decision. No one should ever be forced to be a parent, that just makes a bad parent. But, should a woman decide to keep the pregnancy, the man will have to provide partial financial support - paid through a third party. He should not have to have contact unless he wants that. Ultimately, it is the woman's choice.",

If a person makes a claim that has this much of incorrectness in this statement, the chances are even if some parts are true, there is a lot of spice added. \n\nAlso, it can be said, the other way round too. He could be the victim here too. Just saying, since many are so obsessed with the finer details. This could be very well a case for KSH and from what i read in Dispatch, i would find it that way and he kept queit to protect this super private stuff from being the eyes of the dangerous judgment of the public. \n\nOn the other side, this is a personal stuff ppl.

I get that it can all be a smokescreen but somewhere deep down my heart tells me this is the kind of person he is. Even before dispatch came out with this article his Uni friends, friends from school and the military defended him saying KSH was naive and good to a fault. His blanket apology and Salt's silence on the matter makes so much sense now.. He truly didn't want to fight about his private life in front of the entire nation. He was willing to take the fall for everything. He was willing to let go of his endorsements and contracts and movie deals. He was willing to let go of his 2D1N family. He wanted to close the matter once and for all when he apologized even if it meant he lost everything. But WHY? Maybe because part of him still wants to protect the woman he once loved. Maybe because he's Catholic he knows abortion is a sin and is bound by the guilt of his actions. Maybe because he truly feels like being in that kind of relationship was all his fault.\n\nThere was NO way he could have predicted the turnout would be like this. That his fans would rally for him with this intensity. That his followers would increase. That his friends would speak out. That he would start a revolution. (PS: I know this is a crackhead thing to say, but the stuff that has gone down in the last week has never happened in the KEnt industry before. He's started a movement that a lot of celebrities will hopefully benefit from in the future.)",

Although the abortion might happened with both parties' consent (KSH and the weather forecaster lady), I don't think the general audience will be comfortable seeing someone with that heavy baggage behind him. We talking about variety shows! But, I think that it wouldn't be a huge problem for him to star in a new dramas or movies.",

If this story keeps unfolding, i think people will get desensitized and just go straight to the point of \"is this illegal or not? No? Carry on\" mentality when another scandal broke. Sort of like how in the US \"oh, X did what now? Lol anw\" quick dismissal.\n\nPoor KSH but I hope the netz got tired and say \"idc, as long as its not illegal they're irrelevant\".",

Atleast korea is better than that in making them take accountability for their actions (except how two consenting adults dating is called scandal or imo extreme cancelling like vixx hongbin who, as far as I know, only stated his opinion  - but if that's part of korean principles and culture, I respect it )",

Oh well, they're the idiot for doing something illegal.\n\nIf their private lives are messed up but not illegal...it affects me how exactly? Its literally not my problem though, so idc. Why would I have vested interest in their lives? They're not my friends. As long as they continue making good stuff i'll still watch/listen to them.\n\nThus my annoyance with this whole KSH scandal. Nothing illegal happened, idc, i like his acting, let him act. Yeesh. Making issues out of a non-issue, right?",

But also, I respect and to an extent, admire, the korean system too. Like the logic of *\"You can't have your cake and eat it too.\"* As common people, even if we do a big help to someone, no one cares but as a celebrity, even if they do small good deeds/ if they behave gentlemanly it is blown over - their public image gets bigger-they get increased exposure- they get more money from resulting ads cfs, etc. If they are going to claim/be claimed for the good they do(like how the celebrity life is), then they should take accountability if they are exposed to fooling the people with their fake \"projected image\" even with regards to their personal life. That is how I understand it. Maybe a korean can give a better explanation.\n\n\nP.S: I would like to take the space here to type something I've been thinking over some time. You know why I love korean variety shows so much? Because the korean guys behave so differently in a way which is so unique from my country. Something very carefree/innocent(idk the right word) but attractive -a certain charm. Shows their culture, good principles and upbringing. If everyone had been raised or \"civilized- as some people say\" with the western culture, we'd be the same, won't we? I hope the global people enjoying kcontent don't bring down korean culture as a whole in the process of comparing it to their/other global cultures.",

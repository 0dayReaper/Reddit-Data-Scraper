I\u2019m torn on this as I always felt like the show\u2019s main idea was \u201cathletes from unpopular sports doing their best in football,\u201d like an underdog development story. But most comments are saying the football is the main idea. But there are many football variety shows, and what makes each different is the premise for the cast (like Golden Stars, the girl team, etc.)\u2026 I don\u2019t think I would have stayed as a viewer if this was just a football thing, as I can just watch pro-football for that. On the other hand, I also understand the coaches\u2018 dilemma. They want to show continuous growth, but not everyone is improving, and I think ratings are decreasing. Maybe a format change is in order rather than it being a problem with the players? After watching it for like 4 years, I find myself only watching the starting segment and delaying watching the games. But I definitely stayed on due to the players.",

I feel with those, the audience really gets a sense of their improvement and it won't feel as stagnant. The framing right now is on the title taking and recently on the Qatar stuff, not on their improvement (I'm watching on netflix so maybe that's where theyre at right now) which is why I feel like even though they are improving, it doesn't always feel like it.\n\nI also agree though about the importance of the team members themselves. If it was just about watching the best players and the strongest team, like you said, there's the actual pro leagues for that. Them growing together and bettering team play is also what got me invested in the show, for sure.",

But most comments are saying the football is the main idea. \n\nBoth are the main things of the show. But there needs to be growth because otherwise no reason to watch if they sucked. The main problem is that there is no real way to measure the team's level of performance because they're always playing against random level opponents. It'd make more sense if they played in K3 or K4 league so that the opponents are around the same level. As of now, it's clear that the Avengers can beat most normal-level amateur teams due to their physical advantage, but Avengers are also comfortably outclassed by opponents that have any knowledge/skill on how to properly play football.\n\n\nPlayer change is always good because the players come and go due to their availability and/or injuries. Imagine if the show had never added the Kyu-Gyu duo, the team would've still struggled to score goals with Jang-Kun at the front. The bigger question IMO is more about whether there is any athlete that actually has good enough skill to be a meaningful addition to the team.",

I wish they could've done this first, maybe stopped when they reached K3/4, and then proceed to the series of title matches. So that the viewers can see firsthand how they are improving. I think a similar plot would be Handsome Tigers (basketball) and CoolKiz On the Block (volleyball) as far as I can remember. It really is an advantage that they were an athlete, but I wish some of them could've done further training esp most of them are already retired. \n\nI also don't get why they are pushing Jangkun again to the front when they know he's so unstable and provide much better performance when he's on defense. I'm watching it on Netflix so it's a lot of eps behind, but currently, they are putting him again as a winger. Kyu-Gyoo line really save the team when they joined. Actually, most Batch3 members are doing so well rn imo. Je-eun and Wonwoo are good. Jihwan is improving. \n\nI was wondering whether they can host another audition but they have so many members now. I really hope they could get past this. I really love the show and would want to watch it for a long time.",

I think the answer is there are multiple reasons.\n\n* Jang-kun has always preferred to play as attacker than defender. While he doesn't have the final say, it's something for the manager to consider.\n\n* When the team are fully fit and available, the CB position is pretty stacked. Andre, Je-un, and Won-woo are all better CB than Jang-kun. Tae-sool is also very capable to fill CB spot when needed.\n\n* On the other hand, CF and LW are quite light. Kyu-Gyoo are the only two players that can consistently fill those two spots properly. The moment one of them is unavailable, the drop off is quite big to whoever is filling up their absence. If both of them are unavailable, basically game over for the team.\n\nBecause all of the above and that Jang-kun is left-footed, I think they just want to give him a chance to play there. It'd be great if it works out. But then again, I don't think it'd work until he fixes his foundation.\n\n&gt; I was wondering whether they can host another audition but they have so many members now. \n\nI think they will have to. They have a lot of members but so many injuries and unavailable due to other reasons. Most of the games would have 15 players which isn't that many. 3-4 more players for LW/CF/RB position would be great. Bonus if there's a proper great GK.",

Unfortunately, it didn't work before and still doesn't now. I do feel sorry for him bc I know he wants to play as an attacker since the beginning but he just gets too overwhelmed upfront. He really does need to improve soon tho if they were to audition new players again.\n\n100% Tae-sool is becoming more reliable as CB and improving every ep. You can feel Je-un's absence on defense when he's not playing, which can really be a problem when he started to get busy again. Andre is kinda becoming a lil problem in defense (based on the recent eps) but still, his presence is an advantage and needed there. He just needs to damn well listen lol. Wonwoo provides the most stable performance despite not being around all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I think they will have to.

If that's so, I hope they will find more capable wingers/shooters and YES PLS EMPHASIZE ON PROPER GK. I do hope they'll put their focus on training the remaining members, esp the OG.",

I was re-watching the game vs Sinjeju FC and I saw Jang-kun stopped playing when he lost the ball (instead of pressing the opponent who got the ball) and he still has the bad habit of standing still and watching the teammate rather than moving to attack. The difference between Jang-kun and Eun-gyoo as LW is like night and day. As sad as this may sound, both for Tae-bum and Jang-kun, I think their best role is as substitute to play in the last 10-15 minutes so they limit their stamina issue. \n\n\nAs for Andre, I think the defensive line issue is really something where video review session would help a lot because he could be shown how keeping the line high could be more beneficial than pulling back. However, I do understand his concern in a sense that playing high-line off-side trap against good opponent is indeed very risky. Defenders are often slower than attackers. Broken off-side trap from such a high line could easily lead to conceding a goal, so Andre would naturally try to have a head start by falling behind. Ultimately though, he should indeed follow the manager's instruction. Live and die as a team rather than having one rogue player even if with well intention.\n\n&gt; YES PLS EMPHASIZE ON PROPER GK.\n\nPreferably someone with healthy enough body that they aren't scared of throwing themselves down to the ground. All three GK seem to still prefer using their feet which defeats the purpose of GK being allowed to use their hands. Maybe there's like a retired Korean national team Hockey or Handball GK somewhere?",

But not in true sense because they'd still end up randomly playing games against teams that have unfit/older players where they're just so far behind in terms of physical capability. These kind of games then masked the Avengers' weaknesses because they massively dominated the play in these type of games. Even the game against Lee Young-pyo's team is something like this.",

But it IS frustrating to see basic mistakes out on the field. \n\nI forget if they've done this before but I would be interested to see an episode where they don't play a match but rather spend their time doing drills and skill clinics. I know we don't see everything they do in the starting segments, but even then it feels like they practice a skill only a few times before moving on, so we don't actually get to see players develop anything through these trainings. Maybe it's too boring and repetitive for viewers haha. But I would personally love an episode that  focuses on players' specific weaknesses and addressing them head on, instead of watching them make those same mistakes over and over in matches.",

The team is playing really well and the difference in play from where they were and where they are is massive. Their offense is no longer anemic with the Gyu duo on the team, balling out. The defensive line plays really well, especially since Andre returned. With Yo-Han back (in the previews for the Jeju match) they should get back on track at the goalie position which would really help. Their midfielders are excellent. Honestly it's just their wingers that are alright but even they have talent that has developed well recently; Tae-bum. He went from the worst player and constantly annoying me with his mistakes to training a lot and it showing on the pitch. \n\nSo I just fail to see where the issue is. Maybe SK's need to go back 20 episodes and watch them play and see how much less skilled and developed they were in order to appreciate how well they are playing now? I don't get how you watch them win some regional matches, scrimmage against pretty solid teams and win, then go to Qatar and DESTROY two teams and then win playing good soccer against a K-3 level team and think \"there need to be changes, we're unhappy, the team needs to be more competitive\".

Donghyun and Taebum are really just variety seniors who make jokes, be funny and bring up the atmosphere who have a good day once in awhile on the field. HyungTaik ~sigh~ I would\u2019ve put him as an atmosphere maker as well but he\u2019s just a little bit too lacking even compared to his S1 counterparts.\n\nI honestly feel like we could get the best out of the show if they get more defenders, recruit one goalkeeper that can work alongside Yohan, add in some more personal moments with the players so that every episode isn\u2019t about a soccer game, reduce the amount of criticism they give the players and dish out more compliments and encouragement.",

But I think Ahn Jung-hwan wants both RB and LB to bomb forward as much as they can. \n\n\nWhoever criticized Min-ho is just being unfair with their expectation. Not counting Nam-kyu who is a former player, Min-ho is without a doubt and by quite a big margin the most intelligent and capable player in the team. He has good skill, he knows where he needs to position himself, and he has the stamina to play the game. \n\n&gt; I wonder if they can recruit stronger players in the wings, how the midfield would look...\n\nIdeally for me, assuming 4-1-4-1 formation and everyone is available, the starting XI should be:\n\n* Nam-kyu\n\n* Eun-gyu, Hyeon-woo, Dae-hoon, Min-ho\n\n* Chil-ku\n\n* Won-woo, Andre, Je-un, Jun-hyeon\n\n* Flip-coin GK (or try-out Tae-sool)",

But the criticism of Minho was in the context of getting players in the wings, iirc. They\u2019re going to strengthen that so they can put Minho in his preferred position. Other recent issues: None of the GKs are doing well, Yohan isn\u2019t even there, Taesool hasn\u2019t been there, Andre has been making a lot of mistakes (the most surprising of which was when he told LDG that he didn\u2019t understand why he was being asked to keep the backline higher to facilitate the offside trap).!&lt;\n\nI think basic trainings and sessions on football enrichment for strategy would be good for them as a team.",

I'm assuming they are putting Taesool as GK??? When he's literally just been improving on the field?  \nAlso the Andre issue, ugh I never liked him tbh. I think Jeun is so much better at maintaining the defense than him although Andre's presence at the defense is in itself an advantage. Andre rarely listens to the coaches and has so much pride, I was baffled when he literally said he couldn't understand LDG like????? But honestly, that episode is a lil off.

I\u2019m only a Netflix watcher, but I love the current format where you get the humorous variety moments in the first half before the match begins.\n\nI\u2019ve actually been re-watching each match and trying to track stats for each one, and while the S1 guys are not at the same level they have shown considerable improvement.\n\nFor example throughout the first 2/3 of the season Tae Bum couldn\u2019t hit a cross to save his life and looks capable in that aspect now. Hyung Taik has also improved his distribution especially with long balls as he\u2019s become more comfortable as a keeper.\n\nI do think neither should be consistent starters and are often the weakest, but the level of competition has certainly turned up as well. They just took the #1 amateur team to extra time and penalties as a team that probably only practices all together once a week.\n\nI would actually love to see them in some sort of league format or another tournament where every match matters.",

The current Avengers have risked their careers playing for this who. They have all worked very hard on their own to become better. If Ahn can't win with this group they should replace the Coach....",

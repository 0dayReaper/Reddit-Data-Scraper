Better to have an alliance when you win/lose and have risk of getting picked, than not having any ally and still have risked being picked. \n\nYeah the format is pretty unsatisfying for me too, the one that placed last still has a leverage to harm other well performed players, and even if you win, if there's no pandora then the only benefit is to be exempted for the day and can pick people to be isolated. All this does is raking enemies. And it's not like being isolated is a huge minus to the person too, it's only a physical inconvenience when they can gain much more if they win. Mostly political game, once you're marked with no allies, you're done for if you didn't have the brain.",

If you're going to become the target anyway like DEX/Hyunji, it's better to come dead last and get to pick your own death match partner\n\nLike let's say this week they made xitsuh win and yunb or LJH lose, then yunb/LJH chooses dex and hyunji. how is that a better win condition?\n\nby losing the main game, dex got to pick pi and seungjin. that is a way better situation to be in than if their team won. he was going to the deathmatch regardless of the result",

Anyway, thoughts for ep 9/10:\n\n* HSJ is an annoying brat and boy am I so &gt;!glad he got eliminated!&lt;. His technique is so childing and employed no brains at all. How could he stay for longer than Yurisa, Sungjoo, and Knucks while not contributing to any game play is a mystery.\n* Another episode, another \"give and take\" LMAO\n* Xitsuh continues to be iconic. I love how he straight up said I'm not gonna pick someone from the Jungle team esp Jinho (because that would be suicide), and how open he is to picking a weak player because that's how you survive a survival game.\n* I really don't understand why &gt;!Pi!&lt; had to reveal it. Seems like she doesn't to because she just said the same thing for that part of her interview lol\n* Dex's idea is both genius and funny! Had to replay that part because his eyes were literally sparkling when he was confirming that all they needed was to get the same block + the genius music? Just chef's kiss.\n* OG Jungle team is still solid and it was very nice to watch them work together for possibly the last time in this episode. &gt;!Jinho spending 19 coins for Hyunji to get a score, Jinho and XS buying additional voting ballots even though it's expensive, Jinho telling them respectfully that it's time to stop the alliance after the games.!&lt; It's all very heartwarming. I'm just over the fence with &gt;!Dex talking to Yunbi over him getting last place!&lt; and with the preview where &gt;!Hyunji wanted XS and Jinho out. It's been 10 episodes and Hyunji still has not contributed strategically to any game. At least Dex has won 2 DM and noticed the darkness of the blocks.!&lt;\n* I love how Jinho's first reaction to every drama is to laugh. HSJ blocking their strategy? Cuss him out and then laugh. &gt;!YunB mad at Pi and calling her a snake?!&lt; \uac1c\uc6c3\uaca8!\n* Nice to see &gt;!Sungjooo!&lt;! Still one of the best personalities in the game personally. A strong opponent but I'm hoping &gt;!XS!&lt; will win an Exemption Card!",

I'm glad Dex botted him out, he's been an eyesore that keeps playing on both sides while placing himself in an advantageous position, when he doesn't really contribute anything aside from being male and has a huge body.\n\nThis is such a filler episode tho, it's like a one episode that is stretched into two episodes, i want more.\n\nAnd Pi really messed up when she was already in an advantageous position... I'll be pissed if i was yunB too but he's not exactly a selfless person either so i don't mind the slipped up.\n\nRooting for the og outdoor team all the way but I'm getting worried about future episodes",

Look at Season 4 of the Genius and how Choi Jung Moon played and look at how Kim Kyung Hoon made the finals despite his boneheaded moves at the start of the season.\n\nThe sense that I got from her (reading into it) was that she just really wanted to gloat in front of Xitsuh's. She got really riled up and called him a r-word after Xitsuh made vague threats about picking her for the death match.\n\nThe last thing I'll say in this is that - all this could be viewed as a simple mistake, which is fine, but what really annoyed me about her was giving away YunB's numbers without asking his consent. That wasn't just a silly mistake, that was completely harmful to YunB's play and put him in danger of everyone else working against him to make him last. I agree with YunB in that situation - she's outright declaring war at that point and marking him an enemy by giving his numbers away.",

The game could've ended much earlier, but they missed the opportunity.\n\nSneaky Xitsuh, deliberately made Dex a loser by not giving any points near the end and acted like he missed something. He knew Dex wouldn't pick anyone from the Wild team and used it to his advantage. Earlier in the game, he kept threatening the other team, he's well aware any loser from the other team will definitely pick him today. Dirty move but a good play so far. There's a good chance now he might get an exemption card and safely reach the finals without being in a death match.",

The could have just made it a longer one episode.\n\nPi being wishy-washy with alliances continues lol, she did it in last week's episode which I thought was interesting, but I didn't know she would he so transparent about it here. She didn't make use of her position well at all. Pi was in the lead and flexibly approachable to the two alliances there, how did she waste it like this??\n\nYunB finally got his coveted solo win. He continues to be sloppy with counting, like when he tried to send HSJ to spend 5 coins for him lmao. If he were playing everything solo he might be in trouble. But he beat Yurisa one on one so fair enough, he's not completely bad.\n\nHSJ was just an eyesore. Completely lacking in strategy and sportsmanship. In this type of game show I understand betrayal-type of tactics and even unfair horse trading to get yourself a good deal. But it's twice now that he's been playing against the spirit of the game; the first in ep 4 when he was physically threatening Dex, and now when he was just making a loud nuisance of himself. He's probably well aware that he can't do anything else but the lack of brainpower involves in his \"tactics\" annoy me. RIP to the pool alliance, what a joke.\n\nThe jungle alliance lives on one last time. Jinho spending 19 coins for Hyunji and Jinho/Chulgu buying voting slips for Dex was probably the last acts of solidarity they would do. They all can see the time is up for such a large group and Jinho was kind enough to break the alliance off cleanly.\n\nI don't think Dex had much right to feel to sold out by Chulgu, the Jinho-Chulgu duo brought their alliance this far in the first place. Dex and Hyunji have never contributed winning tactics. Dex honestly didn't even seem to see that the point of winning this time was for everyone to draw the same number until Jinho mentioned it (though unfortunately his colour shade tactic was more difficult for everyone else anyway).  Well, HSJ did succeed in preventing them from coming up with a strategy and taking the early lead so bad sportsmanship works sometimes.\n\nI liked seeing Dex outdo HSJ in the death match. I'm not confident that anyone is a lock to have beaten Dex at both his death matches. He is good at them.\n\nHope Jinho/Chulgu/Dex make it far still. Pi will probably be easy enough to eliminate and I don't know how well Hyunji will do without a team to follow. Jinhyeong is smart but not calm and not good at the social game. YunB will have his ways of worming his way in which is also fair, he's the most political player around and his messing with the alliances made the season a lot more exciting. Sometimes he is on your faves' side, sometimes he is not. Most importantly, he is always on YunB's side.",

Jinho even doubled down like that despite his fear of the wild (YunB\u2019s threat). Chulgu actually made the safest decision (letting YunB score). Hyunji didn\u2019t despite being the richest and closest to Dex. But Dex will still question Chulgu regardless. Considering the hard carry and assist by Jinho and Xitsuh, it\u2019s honestly not cool how he acted like they\u2019ve abandoned him when it\u2019s just how the situation is. And he even stated (maybe in later ep but it was shown in the preview right) how in team plays taking a risk is natural.. so he knows that? I\u2019m really not for him acting like being saved is a given.\n\nActually I liked Dex/Hyunji better than Chulgu before this ep, but in this ep I\u2019m leaning more towards Chulgu and I\u2019m ready for Hong Jinho &amp; Chulgu (which is very reminiscent of JDM w Oh Hyun Min but upgraded..) play without the old wild team. It was good while it lasted. But Hyunji one off and Dex acting all that was.. yeah. I\u2019ve also seen the reviews and YunB actually revealed that Hyunji already kinda strayed in ep 7 but it got cut off (perhaps cos they want to paint a good picture of the protagonists/old wild team). So yea I take my words back, YunB was not stupid for asking Hyunji, he was just stupid to do it in front of Jinho and Chulgu. I think at this point YunB is a better political player than Lee Sangmin. He has the gift of gab. \n\nJinho have the ability to win but carried them as far as he can without asking to win or protect himself even once, and even now that it\u2019s time to disband he\u2019s laying it out in a sportive manner. I think he\u2019s got the clearest conscience. \n\nOkay, I\u2019m ready Dex\u2019s fans, I\u2019ll accept your downvotes with a big heart. But pls think objectively too.",

Like in both Food Chain and 7 Commandments he literally just got the randomly allocated role that guaranteed his victory, in Layoff Game they literally invited 8 of his friends into the game so they just pushed him to win, in Big Deal Game he was literally forced to win by Yohwan because it was in Yohwan's interest. And that's just scratching the surface layer lmao.\n\nIt's an achievement, but to say Sangmin \"operated on some next god level\" is fantastical.",

But if you look at the game situation it was pretty clear he couldn\u2019t let him eat that point. If you look at the game from the beginning to end, the real turning point was not Xitsuh at the end. It was Hyunji spending money, and then Jinho spending money to let Hyunji eat some point because she was so desperate she betrayed them. That led to Ha Seungjin eating some point too, also led to Jinho not being able to spend more to save Dex. Though I haven\u2019t watched S1, I know just how loyal Dex is. I\u2019ve even said in a previous comment how loyal Dex is. I do also think that it might had been loyalty that stopped him from taking action before it\u2019s too late and followed the team instead (On the other end, Hyunji\u2019s desperation saved her but showed how she doesn\u2019t have loyalty).\n\nThat being said I\u2019m not questioning his loyalty at all. I just mind how he get to the conlusion that Xitsuh have anything to do with his downfall at all. Because he actually don\u2019t, it was like a killing blow to a half dead man. If it was me, I would have either: saved myself and told them I have to save myself even if it means ruining their plan (moved my own ass, like Hyunji but with warning), or just stayed quiet and prepared for the death match without being angry.  In the softest way possible (if it wasn\u2019t Dex I could have been more brutal), in my perspective I can either conclude to him being entitled, or lacking comprehension skill enough to not know that Hyunji is the one who ruined his chances. I personally think being entitled is a better quality than being dumb so I decided to move forward with that point instead of questioning his intelligence.\n\nI do think Dex is a good person, is he suited for such games? I don\u2019t think so.",

Even with all his not so good moments not being highlighted, one can tell his game comprehension is kinda lacking, there have been countless little moments since ep 5 where he asked the obvious and I was surprised... which is alright and you are correct again that he knows how to step back/being cooperative. Which comes to the main point that in that situation he should know beggars can't be choosers. \n\nThere are two possible Dex's logic rn: (1) He's disappointed despite knowing Chulgu made the best decision. (2) He's disappointed because he cannot thoroughly understand the decision reasoning, and just concluded that to Chulgu being selfish.  \n\n If it's 1 (which is slightly better and I do hope so), that is just not cool of him.

He is someone who emphasizes loyalty is important. Since season 1, he has had this kind of mindset. Since Xitsuh kind of lied to him in the game, so he felt betrayed. But the thing is the final goal of the bloody game is not about the alliance. Anyway in the end there will be only a single winner. This is not a society game where a team match is the final goal. I think dex maybe suitable for society game, where physical strength is also appreciated. But I believe dex is not suitable for bloody game. Honestly, participating in bloody game just make him looks so dumb for many times, even since season 1. He hardly can understand comprehensively most of the games being played.",

Jinho spends 19 coins too, which makes even less sense at the time to me.\n\nI think Jinho has some good luck/intuition when playing too. But i don't think him roaming around is a stupid thing to do. They're in a new territory so of course the first thing to do is to know your perimeter. And they also started with nothing, even more reason to search for possible other resources or possible hidden quests. As much as it's a survival, he's still in a game show.\n\nBrain is obviously not Dex's main advantage. Especially when some others are picked for their brain prowess or political skill, and the game is mostly constructed around that skillset too.\n\nI think he understands the circumstances just that he's placed in a bad position because of variables and their decision making, and Chulgu is the one that assures him but doesn't go thru with what he's saying. Chulgu also doesn't explain things properly so it adds to his frustration, but this is due to the time constraint tbh. And it's not like he lashed out at them either, he's allowed to be sad/disappointed when he's in a bad place right.",

But it seems like he's trying to cut Hyunji and Dex off cleanly by doing his best saving them at this round. Spending so much money on them. \n \nI agree with all you're saying though.",

                    "comment": "Nah man, I can\u2019t agree with that comparison. Put some respect on SangMin\u2019s name.\n\nYunB is like KimGura. Yea YunB is a proactive player but he isn\u2019t smart like SangMin. Just like KimGura, YunB plays an active role in the political strategy and he lays it out straight convincing players to trust him based on his word and honor. The problem with this playstyle is that it paints a target on their backs. The outdoor team knows that YunB is dangerous with his ability to create alliances, so they are desperately trying to eliminate important members of his alliance. They really don\u2019t care about Pie or her boyfriend, because those are disgraced members, they are swing votes that can be persuaded to help the outdoor team when necessary. \n\nIts like that idiom, \u201cThe nail that sticks out get hammered down.\u201d\n\nAlso, all of the active play by YunB creates opening for betrayal, because there is room in his plans for people to make mistakes. Meanwhile Jinho\u2019s alliance was rock solid for a long time because their plans were simplistic and relied on the idea that when possible outdoor team sticks together. \n\nSang Min is smart, he went into The Genius with the strategy that he will do his best to blend in. Sang Min makes sure that he is not a threat. He helps everyone understand the games to a degree and he shys away from making big moves early on. He plays the role of kingmaker and finds active players like YunB and he whispers good strategies into their ears and lets those other players take all of the action. Most importantly unlike YunB, SangMin is actually a super likeable guy. He makes jokes and knows how to have a little fun. He puts himself in a position where no one wants to eliminate him. Then when he gets near the finals or has to play a deathmatch Sangmin finally unleashes his brainpower and wins his duels because no one expects it from him. Hell, people knew SangMin was a threat the second time he went on The Genius and he still was able to blend in and squeak past. \n\nIts like this with any Survival shows. Its really hard to get eliminated early on in the show so you just have to take that risk. If you aren\u2019t active enough and try to just be a neutral party then people will eliminate you because they will be afraid of you for being unpredictable. Sangmin rides that fine line of joining alliances but never being the leader of those alliances. \n\nAlso, YunB made the worst political blunder of the show so far. YunB had the ability to stay in the outdoor team but left to create the pool alliance, all because YunB wanted to be a leader. The Pool Alliance should have stayed a secret and YunB should have used that to try and betray Jinho in a game to make him last. Instead he immediately announced his new alliances and attempted to try and convince all of the outdoor players to join his alliance. \n\nAlso, all of the players have said that its very clear that YunB is selfish and is only worried about making himself the winner. The only reason that trick with Pie worked was because they didn\u2019t know about the special bonuses he got from the phantom casino. \n\nThere is really no point in trying hard during the main games right now. The perk of being able to isolate a player isn\u2019t useful unless you plan to send a team mate there, and you can\u2019t avoid the deathmatch right now. The loser gets to pick basically anyone they want for the deathmatch, so whats the point in trying so hard to win these matches. Sure YunB has been able to get a lot of deathmatch exemptions but his alliance members paid the price for him trying to win the main matches. He doesn\u2019t have a single ally left. There is a very high possibility that YunB is playing in the next deathmatch.",

Sangmin's understanding of the game is usually higher than YunB. And that is actually the reason why I compared the two politics skills. YunB being able to survive without as much intelligence vs Sangmin who can survive far with his politics plus intelligence... you gotta give credits to YunB too. \n\nThen there's one big difference between Bloody Game and The Genius which made Sangmin's play impossible to replicate. And it's also why YunB is not that stupid for leaving Wild Team. Bloody game pits the players more against each other. Sangmin avoided most if not all the death matchs in The Genius by joining the most profitable alliance each time, either winning or being in the majority each time. You cannot replicate this in Bloody Game because of the voting system. YunB is selfish yes, if he had stayed in the Wild Team, he knew he would be in the winning team but that just meant he would be a candidate for voting. So far he has either stayed in the losing team wirhout being the loser, or winning in the winner team. Both guarantee him a vote exemption. \n\nI don't think the fact that he lost all his allies so far is such a big deal since it's already past halfway just now. \n\nAnd about Sangmin being likable vs YunB being not so likable. The editing works wonders. Sangmin is a comedian that was meant to light up the room in The Genius (him and Jang Dongmin, that unexpectedly to the PDs are geniuses), so they were edited/+played that way too. Meanwhile Bloody Game PD tries to make the game as tense as possible instead. YunB actually had crazily good relationship with all of them according to the reviews but it all got cut off.\n\nThough I also agree that Sangmin's play is more headturning and exhilirating. YunB is really good too.\n\nHaha I'm not a fan of political play or particularly a fan of any of them so comparing the two just makes me tired.",

            "comment": "Ep 9\n\nYunbi vs Yurisa casino game: i thought Yunbi was banished at the evening?.. But the game was during the day: did they postpone the game to morning? Also they better change cloth on that table: that makes two people sleeping on it.\n\nYurisa was using similar tactic to Mina's adding blocks to opponent but it backfired when she missed once, and Yunbi got a full hand and and dealer didn't have enough blocks for her so she was left with fewer blocks. When sum of blocks is revealed it became very easy to guess them, which he did.\n\nHa, we finally got that Pi's red dress. Jinho no longer needs crutches! Xitsu just like in ep 1 expects someone to copy his notes and obfuscates them.\n\nHa Seungjin continues to be massive cringelord. I think this is even worse than the fight -- at least his scuffle with Dex was outside the game. But at least it worked and they dominated 2 rounds until Pi started doing Pi things. lol at Yunbi pulling 99 (nice).\n\nFunny how Dex was able to do a Jinho with dice trick and editors made sure to pull several tracks from Genius OST culminating with Idiotape's [Melodie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emoadwiK4TM) pumping full blast aaand credits...\n\nEp 10\n\nWe're still on that main game!\n\nHaha, what was that world's smallest violin during Xitsuh and Dex falling out?..\n\nYunbi almost spit out his water during deatmatch announcement.\n\nPattern Block game is actually really fun and hard. Both players are right that you have to prepare fixed shapes like circles and squares in advance but i think they should have not taken blocks from these patterns, keep them on the table for reference, and make answers out of same blocks from the pile.\n\nAt least YunB didn't send Jinho shuffle off to jungle on crutches and sent Xitsuh which is completely fair game since he did the same to him yesterday.\n\nlol at Yunbi saying \"Xitsuh is egotistical player\". YunBi's mannerisms and gestures make him a fun screen presence. He's a bit slimy but he's very fun.",

As irritating as it is to watch, I can picture Seungjin (having played basketball in the US) viewing disruption tactics as just another, albeit dirty, layer of gameplay you can use. Whereas for Jinho for example (whose experience is more from Korean esports), he would probably find it really inappropriate for someone to engage in extreme trash talking and such while playing games. Jinho talked recently about how in poker people would talk a lot to try and mess with him, so he'd just wear earphones and ignore people.\n\nBut naturally those type of tactics will cause a lot of people to be displeased and actively want you out of the game lmao.",

The Celtics became so enraged that their whole team became lazer focused on winning and then proceeds to shoot like 90% in the last half of the game. Even their bench players couldn\u2019t miss. \n\nThis happens all of the time in sports. Sometimes it works, especially on inexperience players it can distract them from focusing on their game, however typically these dirty tactics just end up making the game harder to win.\n\nThis is why Michael Jordan got famous for that line \u201cI took it personal.\u201d He used to cause beefs and make up beefs in his mind to give himself the motivation to crush his opponents. \n\nThere have also been teams in sports that have stolen signs from their enemy. Baseball in particular had an infamous problem with this. I played baseball in highschool and there was a play that shortstops would do where if a runner was on second they would creep up behind the baserunner and then run in front of them to distract and block the runner from being able to see when the pitcher was going to throw, and to run across their path to prevent them from getting a good jump to steal 3rd. My baseball team also used to yell really loud when the other team was pitching to distract them. \n\nThere have been all kinds of dirty tricks devised and taken advantage of in sports. Over time the rules tend to get changed in an effort to try and prevent these dirty tricks but a Sports player is going to try and take any advantage they can get. \n\nThese a popular sports saying that goes \u201cIf you ain\u2019t cheating, you ain\u2019t trying.\u201d",

Her only saving grace is that with Jinhyeong and smaller teams, she stands a chance as a pair. \n\nHSJ was an idiot with no real benefit as he was always going to the DM regardless. For an athlete he shows little respect and took pride in his display, which he really shouldn't.\n\nYunB is a snake but played well he understood the game immediately and secured a win. I don't like how obvious he is and that Dex is falling for it. Though its likely to be a fake out as last week they hinted at Dex and Xitsuh falling out but it was nothing. \n\nHyunji made the biggest mistake though, she was fairly safe and I think even the OG survival team would've taken her spot in the DMs if pushed but she pissed off Jinho and is setting her up with Xitsuh while Jinho and Dex team up.\n\nWhile I'm enjoying this season, the casting director needs to bring in less toxic characters or characters that don't really strand a chance. The OG house team pretty much sucks and I'm happy most of them are gone.",

So many of the money challenges have just been like \"make an alliance, guess what the opposition will do, psych them out\", so I think you could make a similar complaint about other types of intelligence getting overlooked.",

Which Jinho shut down so cleverly. Bye fool\n\nPi - Ah, money game Pi came back! I was wondering when this sore winner would show up. As the others said, all she wanted to do was gloat to Xitsuh after he threatened her rather than stay cool and beat him through the game. And then spilling her guts to Jungle team, crying about it and getting mad at YunB? Messy messy messy. So much for the image rehab girl\n\nDex - Go off king. Though he's more subdued in the mansion he can still hold his own and is great at thinking of things in his own way. Others still think he's the weak point of the Jungle alliance but that might be Hyunji imo. \n\nJinho - didn't do much this game, I guess he was grappling with the realization that the alliance was too big and how to handle that. I like that he said they should go their own ways. Although if it's Dex+Hyunji vs Jinho+Xitsuh... well it's not even close lol\n\nYunB - he went up a LOT in my rankings with this episode. He is definitely the dark horse and I think he's such an active and committed player. Love his quid pro quo mentality and willingness to strike a deal with anyone. We shall see how he deals with the very precarious position he now finds himself in, but if anyone can flip this situation it has to be him. Getting his hooks into Dex might be the key.\n\nHyunji - that momentary impulsiveness to spend her coins could be viewed as a betrayal of Jungle team. I hope to see more of her next game when they play solo.\n\nXitsuh- idk if he actually made a mistake or schemed it but throwing Dex under the bus was pretty solid betrayal and I respect it. He's always been more aligned with Jinho than the actual Jungle team and that's gonna come out soon as he clashes with Dex. Exciting times ahead.\n\nJinhyeong - I prefer not to speak.\n\nOthers thought it was mid but I enjoyed the episode. Only criticism is that the game seems too similar to the last one. The pacing should be different.",

I\u2019m a fan but I feel bad how some haters here downplay his DM survivals as pressure n stress takes a toll esp when u know you\u2019re a likely target everyday playing DM games that aren\u2019t really in your comfort zone unlike majority of the brain smart players there.

The three others seem like the ones that are most dangerous in terms of survivability. YunB has the vote exemption (I think? He didn't end up needing it this time.), Pi's anyone-but-me strategy has the potential to make her a vote that someone can use, and Jinhyeong somehow keeps surviving these situations despite his extreme lack of social skills.\n\nWith four episodes left and seven contestants, I feel like they're going to do the same thing they did in season one where they rushed two eliminations at the final four to get to the final two.

Also, Pi's audacity .. lol.. she was acting smart, YunB got her on her knees... and then she has the audacity to throw tantrums and huff and puff... rofl\n\n5. HJ is useless.. replace her\n\n6. YURISA - lost.. no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\n7. Hate it or not, SJ game was funny, astute, and jinho might have  forgotten, but he tried something similar in genius (ofcourse he couldn't take that strategy all the way).. but genuinely there was nothing wrong with what he did.. \n\n8. Dex's comeback. Last death match prepared him... but honestly, this alliance is not adding much to the game from thinking hat perspective. Today Dex did something (tracking folks going into the room, guessing on time etc).. hope he grows from hereon..\n\n\nthis alliance needs to stop depending on jinho\n\n\n8. I LOVE how jinho told the model to work independently in team of two.. that was as directly as he could tell her :D :D .. savage, sassy jinho is fun!!!",

And the game for the deathmatch is somewhat don't need to relly much about strategic thinking. Simply about recognizing spatial pattern. I don't think dex will survive if later he go to the death match again, unless he picks hyunji for the deatch match. Or the deatchmatch that he faces always about recognizing pattern again and again.\n\nAnd I think hong jinho decided to disban the team not simply because it's hard to save everyone. But he thinks far to the future. If later he needs to pick someone for the deatmatchs, he can simply pick the weakest members, either dex or hyunji, without worrying about the alliance. Actually it is true it's time to break the alliance, how come the weakest members like dex and hyunji advancing to the final. It will be boring if they go to the final. So anti climax.",

This type of game doesn't have many strategies where brain player take advantage of and kids are usually better than adults in this type of game. Seeing how much they suck at this game, I guess these casts don't stand any chance against Dex in this particular game where spatial memory is tested.",

It's entirely possible Dex would win, but I don't think that's evidence enough lol",

Maybe it's nostalgia but the games in S1 were designed like garbage and were so dependent on luck more than brains, that it's a miracle the winner ended up being the person who actually understood the games best lmao",

Why having overlapping numbers is good? When Dex told them about the dark tone. Does it not increase their vulnerabilities?\n\nIf all four of them had 10 as a number, and pay to move the coin. All that opposition has to do is pay 1 coin to move the clock and all 4 of 10 holders lose",

Having overlapping numbers is good because you can elevate everyone at once in one go, and because (if I remember correctly) bids aren\u2019t totalled, the highest bid wins and everyone else\u2019s coins get discarded and wasted. So if the 4 people get the same night number, they can all agree to push to 10 and if that works someone can bid 12 coins and they could very plausibly get 4 points that way (6 if they push 12 again so they get points before having to repick blocks)",

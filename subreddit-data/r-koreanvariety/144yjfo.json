    "postText": "\nI've been religiously watching KDramas for almost a decade now, but I hadn't explored any variety shows because of my general bias against reality shows in English and other languages, they always seemed so overrated. \nBut I watched the Siren, and I was blown away at how good it was. \nI loved the idea of an all female cast, and how this was about survival, strategy and teamwork. And how it was just about regular people doing really well in their fields and not already influencers or celebs. \n\nAre there any other variety shows that you'd recommend in the same genre?",

            "comment": "Depends on whether you need it to be an all female cast because all-female cast varieties are rare and even rarer still are the ones that are actually good and are survival based. Off the top of my head, ***I'm a Survivor*** is about surviving and working together both as a team and individually and features an all-female cast but keep in mind they're all regular female celebs except for Lee Siyoung so the skill level is much lower. If you're looking for non-celeb competitive shows then there's a decent amount on Youtube and the ***Physical: 100*** show on Netflix. The only one I can think of that features a lot of females and is definitively survival is ***\uc0dd\uc874\ub0a8\ub140*** on YT (it's 10 males and 10 females).\n\nIf you don't care about the survival aspect as much and would love to explore all-female cast variety shows, then I recommend ***Shooting Stars (Kick A Goal)*** which is about female celebs trying out soccer, ***Girls Highschool Mystery Class*** which is more about mystery solving and sketches, oldies but still classics like ***Heroes (2010)*** and ***Invincible Youth S1***, and more that I can't think recall rn.\n\nIf you don't mind all-male casts then you've easily a dozen more shows like the ***Iron Squad*** and ***The Soldiers***. However, if you like survival shows in general and it doesn't have to be set in the wilderness and features more strategic team-building and lots more competition, then I wholeheartedly recommend The Genius series, maybe the Bloody Game S1&amp;2, or even The Society Game.\n\nKeep in mind, finding shows that mostly feature regular people and are all-female is nearly impossible unless you're willing to include ALL types of survival shows in which case the idol, rapper, and dancing ones are included but I'm guessing that's likely not what you're looking for. Anyways, I hope you find some of my recs helpful and if not, then at least figure out what kind of direction you'd like to follow on your k-variety journey.",

It's a football show directed by Ahn Jung Hwan, a Korean football legend. \n\nA little synopsis:\nThey auditioned Korean National Athletes from different sport to create a football team where they will challenge the best amateur football team.\n\nYou can watch the show with Eng Sub on Netflix or watch it raw on kokoatv. \n\n(P.S. It's still ongoing, but it will get better throughout the show. Please give it a try \ud83d\ude4f)\n\nHappy Binging!\ud83e\udd17",

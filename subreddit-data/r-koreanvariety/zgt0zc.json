Basically in the webtoon it's based off of, the app would find out who you like, through what method I don't know, and essentially ring the person you likes alarm when you're within a 10m radius. It was super popular and has a drama and stuff based off of it too. In this one, people just vote for the one person they like or want to get to know the most and the 10m radius and alarm ringing still exist. I don't really like how they added the game's objective, I feel like it just increases the chance for people to be fake, but essentially what it is is that any time someone votes for you as the person they like, you get a heart. The couple at the end who matches up with the most number of hearts between the 2 win the prize money, which will probably lead to this atmosphere of people trying to get the most hearts by playing the game (not telling who you like and trying to make others like you) which I'm not a fan of. A special feature of this show is you can like anyone, man or woman. There seems to be at least 3 members (Tarzan, Tinkerbell, Gumiho) who have in the past been attracted to someone of the opposite sex, so there's that as well which will probably also add some drama. I hope someone subs it so more people talk about it on the sub, I want to watch it with others lol",

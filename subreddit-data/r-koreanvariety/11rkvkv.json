Sea Salvage &amp; Rescue Unit (SSU, Navy)\n4. 707th Special Mission Group, Special Warfare Command (SWC, Army)\n5. Teuk-jeon-sa/\ud2b9\uc804\uc0ac Special Warfare Command (SWC, Army) \n6. Special Duty Team (SDT, Military Police)\n7. Special Air Rescue Team (SART, Air Force)\n8. Headquarters Intelligence Detachment (HID)\n\nWill we see these 8 teams again in Season 3? \n\nAny well-known faces joining Season 3? I'm hoping Dex (Kim Jin Young) will apply to represent UDT/SEAL \ud83d\ude4f",

Mine has always been UDT/SEAL since Season 1 \ud83e\udd2d. Season 1's UDT/SEAL had 2 good looking reservists: Yook Jun Seo &amp; Kim Beom Seok (now his name is Kim Min Jun). I loved their camaraderie &amp; teamwork! Season 2's UDT/SEAL team was so-so. I was more curious about the HID team since most of their work is confidential LOL~ To my surprise, they were awesome!",

I'm also fascinated by counterterrorism techniques, so I always rooted for UDT and 707 on those missions. And I will always have a soft spot for Marines, because they're so gung ho.

You must have learned a lot.\n\nAh, I was wondering why you preferred S1 over S2, because I liked them equally. Several of the S2 members were very funny, but maybe it didn't come across well in the captions? For example, HID's \uc774\ub3d9\uaddc and the UDT team captain were trash talkers. And the very intimidating-looking SART member spoke like an old man with a country accent. Did you watch enough episodes of S2 to see the return of the S1 UDT team?\n\nRe: the HID team, I just assumed they were members who had never deployed and never would deploy. But I really don't know. I've only heard very old rumors about HID from my dad.",

I often use it to translate raw manhwa.   \n\nEdit :  \nI didn't mention any app because we didn't know what platform OP is using.  \nOCR translator is just an umbrella term for method of translation,  not app name.  \n\nPersonally I use \"screen translator\" (yes  that's the actual name of the app)  or bubble translator.   \nBoth for Android, idk if both were available on iphone or other platform.  \n\nBoth were super practical, there's no need to screenshot or take pictures, it literally translate anything you highlight on your screen.",

I find Papago extra helpful (and accurate) with Korean since it's actually made specifically for that language, although I can't speak for other translators cause I don't use them much.",

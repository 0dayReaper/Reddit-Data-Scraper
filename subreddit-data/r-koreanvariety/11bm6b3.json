The cast is trying their best but because there's so little to work with, the staff trying to milk any organic moments b/w the members just feels...disappointing and uncomfortable. At this point, I hope they just take a month break and actually use that time to make a solid outline of how they want 2023 to go, scheduling proper guests, and giving the cast a break away from the chore that is HDYP, because I'm genuinely worried this would only get worse and the show ends up on a permanent hiatus. \n\nAt this point, if a break is not possible, then just have them do a board game project complete with prizes, invite guests who could be fun, stick them in a guest house, and just watch the magic happen. Logistics wise, it should be easy to schedule since it'll be any location indoors, board games are easily bought and modified to include some kind of physical aspect, and you can incorporate food ppl because ordering in when playing games/hanging out with your friends is second-nature to these guys. Because of the variety of board games and the close proximity allowing for banter to flow naturally, you can stretch it out for another week and assuming it's done properly, could give the staff breathing room to plan bigger projects. It's like the perfect mix b/w the chaotic interactions from gaming akin to Na PD's Game Caterers, and the cozy, simple, and intimate fun of Family Outing.",

It felt like crossing the line a bit and seems like a sure way to get Mijoo and JinJoo to receive hate and just because they can both sing doesn't necessarily mean they should be a unit. I wish they just stuck to the dancing concept for now. I also kinda think having so many alone/lead YJS segments will never allow viewers to move on from the old HDYP format, they need to focus on getting the other members more involved and bulding chemistry.",

Suggesting that it be handed off to other people was tactless and rude of the PD, especially when you have a camera in YJS's face and he can't say no. Additionally, as you said, this sets up both Mijoo and Jinjoo for criticism. It's similar to when they let Mijoo participate and pass during the WSG wannabe auditions. I'm not saying Taeho was infallible but he seemed much more aware of public perception and reaction.",

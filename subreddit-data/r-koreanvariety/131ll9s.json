    "postText": "Possible spoilers for episode 1 and 2. What are everyone's thoughts on this season's \"basement\" twist? I thought episode 1 was okay, can't really comment much on the contestants since they haven't shown much character. At first I felt this season was gonna be boring because of the contestants until the twist at the end of episode 1. Episode 2 was just pure reality tv comedy gold, I'm starting to question my sexuality as I find Dex hilariously manly, no way he does these things for show!",

            "comment": "After episode 2, I am very hyped to see the rest of the season. Initially I was worried season 2 would be too similar to season 1, but so far this season feels completely fresh. I like that there are now deathmatches instead of just eliminating by majority vote. This way the strongest players can't just be easily eliminated by a group of weaker players. \n\nThe new \"basement\" mechanic is similar to season 1, but with some new interesting twists. First of all, I am already rooting for the basement team because they have Jinho, Dex, and Jimin which I am a big fan of. The kidnapping mechanic makes things exciting, although it's not really explained how kidnapping works. At what point is the person considered \"kidnapped\" and can no longer escape back to the mansion? They used clever manipulation to get him to blindly follow them, but I wonder what would happen if he refused.\n\nIt's kind of funny that no-one in the mansion has talked about a possible \"basement\" in season 2. You would think they would be more cautious after seeing season 1, but it looks like this season is probably going to reveal the basement in episode 3 so I guess the mystery isn't meant to last long.",

It seems like they just made that shit up and are pretending like its an official thing because this show has a lot off twist. \n\nThe guy kinda got scammed, but being hidden is somewhat good. Yes he can\u2019t earn money playing the games but he also can\u2019t get eliminated. The problem with being kidnapped is that once they win the switch game the other hidden players will probably target the kidnapped player in the house games to eliminate him. \n\nI also am not surprised that no one has talked about the basement. It\u2019s barely been a day, and for all we know they could have talked about the basement but the producers edited those conversations out. \n\nPlus, if the show followed the same formula as the first season they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the basement for a couple days because they had to eliminate a player first to send them to the basement. I would also assume that the show has a different twist.",

But what if there is still a 3rd team made from those eliminated? Just imagine, it is episode 6, 4 players have been eliminated and there are still 5 hidden players and 5 mansion players! Episode 7 would then play what and where the eliminated players have been. I'm calling it!",

If you look on Viki the one trailer has Pi in a red dress and hair style she didnt have on her brief stay, which means she isn't gone yet. She's out of the house but not in the jungle, so there's clearly a 3rd group of exiled members or whatever. Combine that with the fact they have been shoving that triangle with 3 symbols in our face theyre practically telling us \"yo there's 3 factions this time, get ready for wild times\"",

Since the eliminated players aren't sent to the basement this season, I would assume there needs to be a different mechanic to allow the basement players to acquire more people. If it's similar to season 1, then eventually it will become mansion team vs basement team, so it would be pretty unfair if one team was outnumbered.",

I really enjoyed Dex and the whole crew adapting to the \u201cwilderness.\u201d\n\nI hope that the show can pull off the basement/ mansion combo thing successfully.

Episode 2 is where the show pops off. The shift from a dingy basement to an abandoned building in the jungle really showcases the difference in budget from S1 and S2. I hope the Jungle team gets bug spray asap because it hasn't even been 2 days and they are already covered in bug bites.\n\nDex and Jinho have been the highlights of the show so far. Dex for being a capable outdoors man catching a chicken in what seems like the first hour after arriving at their camp. And Jinho for being clutch getting exactly 10 seconds without looking at a timer.\n\nOther comments. I think the dealer is overly stiff. She gives these robot-like vibes especially how she stares at the camera revealing the cards during the deathmatch game. Unsure what Hyunji brings to the Jungle team so far, but not really her fault since she is overshadowed by three famous contestants. I think Jimin inviting Xitsuh was a mistake. Even if the plan is to eliminate him in the future, they still have to deal with his toxic behavior for a few days. YunB or Sunjoo would have been better picks.",

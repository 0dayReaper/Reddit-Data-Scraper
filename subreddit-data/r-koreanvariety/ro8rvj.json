It doesn't mean that she doesn't like Jin Taek - she can just be trying to take care of everyone because that is her personality. I would definitely do the same as her even though I like someone because I feel it is only fair. If someone doesn't like that then it shows more about their personality.",

Also I don\u2019t get Junsik, like bro, Yeawon is trying so hard to flirt and shes actually trying to get to know him in a fun way, and he was so uninterested (although that could be just how they edited it).\n\nAnd Sehoon\u2026 idk if it\u2019s just me but he literally spent half of episode 3 and all of ep 4 sitting there like  \ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude44\u2026 lol the camera would zoom on his face for so long and I was like okayyy\u2026 but I guess he now knows to move on, so Im excited for his next moves.\n\nFor Jintaek I do see where he\u2019s coming from, he\u2019s there to talk to everyone and flirt which is the point of the show, but bro, please do it in a less creepy way. Like I was sitting there feeling so uncomfy when he was flirting w Jiyeon. And I felt bad for her cuz she clearly was there to talk and get to know him in a platonic way, but he was flirting just a bit too strong.\n\nim very much ngl, i don\u2019t care abt hyeonjoong or Sihun. Like I love Jia and I\u2019m interested in who she\u2019s gonna choose, but both boys seem so boring to me. Hyeonjoong needs to take his own advice and talk to other girls, and Sihun kind of just needs to chill. He is weirdly obsessed with her\u2026. Like in a weird way. But it was nice that both boys were giving each other an opportunity to talk to her.\n\nand my girl Soyeon\u2026 she\u2019s really cool and it seems like she\u2019s very much comfortable in her skin and is so down to earth. Though, she\u2019s 100% not going to find a match which is sad bc she\u2019s definitely one of my favs on this show. Like her comment abt Jiyeons lips had me dead. she really just called out Sehoon for contradicting himself, and played it off really cool when he said he was only looking at her eyes.",

Jia is using her appearance and charm , which obviously appears literally on the surface to say charming things to give a reciprocal impression to manipulate the men , JH and Si-Hun to like her. \n\nThey wouldn't like her if her interest wasn't reciprocated, it clearly was if you watched her spend the two nights in paradise with each respective partner, she was clearly signaling interest and reciprocating in their approach. There's nothing superficial about being attracted to someone who reciprocates their interest in a convincing manner, much like both JH and Si-Hun were.\n\nIf anything, this makes Jia superficial as it seems like she has the charm and says all the right things and gives off the right impression to make the boys like her, but you can tell even at this point she is fickle in her preference between the two men, as evident in her last interactions in episode 4. This is the exact definition of superficial , her words hit strikingly effective on the outside but don't have the honesty or depth to be considered genuine truth. At least , that's the character she's portraying to me thus far.",

I know he picked her on the first day but then he was waiting for Jiyeon (maybe for Jia too?) on the second day so I was getting confused! He\u2019s also much older than I expected. For some reason, I thought he\u2019d be the maknae at 24-25 haha. He is super cute when he\u2019s around Jia but I think he fawns over her a bit too much. \n\nOn the other hand, Jia just seems to enjoy Sihun\u2019s attention and is more interested in Hyeonjoong. Hyeonjoong definitely likes Jia too but doesn\u2019t worship her like Sihun does. Also, Jia did say she likes Hyeonjoong the most out of all the available guys but based on the preview, she\u2019ll probably just go for the new guy next week haha.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect Jiyeon and Jintaek to choose each other either but we didn\u2019t see a lot of their interactions in the past few days. Jiyeon has that pure and innocent image but is a little bit boring beyond that. Jintaek meanwhile is flirtatious/fun with Jiyeon and is considering his options for sure! I think Jintaek is still interested in Soyeon but I don\u2019t think he needs to feel obligated to stay with Soyeon, tbh. They went on ONE date and they\u2019re here to meet new people. \n\nSoyeon probably realized that with Jintaek now looking around, she needs to take some risks as well. And since Jiyeon obviously doesn\u2019t reciprocate Sehoon\u2019s love calls, Soyeon\u2019s making her move now. When they both revealed their choices from the first day, I think things really shifted for their relationship. Not sure if Sehoon\u2019s actually interested in Soyeon but at least he\u2019s not playing soccer alone anymore! \n\nAs for Yehwon and Junsik, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much substance? I can\u2019t tell if Junsik actually likes Yehwon or just wanted to go to Paradise Island haha. Maybe they\u2019ll show us more about their different sides? \n\nAlso super excited for the next two episodes! Can\u2019t wait for the new contestants to join the love battles hehe. I hope Sehoon gets to go to Paradise Island next time so we can finally find out his age/profession!",

But I guess that\u2019s just Soyeon\u2019s cheerful and nonchalant personality. \n\nMan it was so cringey watching Sihun openly obsess over Jia, it was too much.

Honestly, the only somewhat likable people here are Soyeon, Jia, and Yeawon for being a good sport. Soyeon for some reason is consistently used by the guys as a stepping stone to get to Jia or Jiyeon despite her personality easily being the most genuine and wholesome of the 4. She deserves better. Same for Jia, although I doubt she'll ever find somebody who can be everything she wants. \n\nI like the convo from the peeps who are left behind because they act much more honestly when they're commiserating. That said, I'm pretty sure the aim of the game is to get matched up and nobody here should get matched. I thought we'd be getting a new gal since it's 5:4 males to female rn but I guess with such a lackluster response for the males (understandably so), the staff felt like they needed to introduce somebody for Jia, the star of the show, to create waves with. If they're going to do this, I hope they let some contestants leave so they can get a fresh batch in cuz no offense, Sehoon, Junshik, and Yeawon aren't going to be matched up unless they get a pity vote which would be unfair to them. \n\nAs an aside, I feel like Sehoon is super inexperienced with dating. I get the feeling he was in a relationship for a long time, broke up, and is now going for that \"single, ready to mingle\" vibe minus the actual skills and experience needed to succeed. I feel for him but also, just want him to not be in front of the camera so his obtuse behavior isn't broadcasted. That, or maybe Soyeon, off-camera if she's nice enough, can kindly tell him to just stop being such an idiot would work too.",

The strange head swooping thing while he's trying to figure out why Jiyeon isn't into him, and the general moping around when cooking on the third night set off some warning flags...nothing specific, but kind of has that slight narcissist/sociopath vibe. Like he has some inability to empathize and understand why his approach isn't working out the way he planned. \n\nIt looked like he had some expectation that, \"If I do visible things, I will 'win' the girl.\"  As if this were some kind of Dating Sim game, and all he had to do was say the right things and trip the right flags.  He seemed confused when he wasn't selected by Jiyeon, after winning  the 'brunch race' in ep. 2.\n\nI thought it was telling in ep. 3 that Jiyeon said she didn't feel any chemistry with him, and she really seemed to agonize over whom to select for the second Paradise night.  She really looked like she was trying to figure out, \"OK, how do I manage to get away from Sehoon tonight?\"  Like she **really** didn't want to spend any time with him if they were both stuck on the island.",

When  Sehun was stating how Jia had his ideal personality compared to Jiyeon, he mentioned Jiyeon probably is closer to that personality than he expects. \n\nWhen the free date was announced, after Sihun declared he was basically all in for Jia, he was the first one out the door and grabbed Jia for a chat.

I don't think she actually meant to pair up with Jintaek either - she wasn't initiating any of the flirtation with him, if anything, she seemed like she was trying to establish friendly talk and he was being flirty so she just rolled with it. I think her type isn't the most popular with female viewers but that's not a knock against her as a person. She almost feels like the epitome of a stereotypical traditional Korean beauty, despite being the one with a western connection.\n\nI'm hoping that Yewon gets her interest reciprocated or starts getting attention from others because she's really out there playing Cupid and she's pretty straightforward with her feelings.\n\nI'm bracing myself for Soyeon bc I get the feeling that Sehoon is not interested in even contemplating a date with her and I'm moreso worried about her pride and self esteem...",

He //kept// objectifying Jiyeon, saying that he has never been with a girl like her, wouldn't normally go for that type of girl, and how he really wants her. And then his disbelief when she keeps rejecting him is so unreal. Like, not every girl wants you bro. Props to Jiyeon for keeping her distance from him.\n2. How is Yewon not more popular?! She seems so friendly and approachable. Her face and body are top tier.\n3. Soyeon won me over with her decision to treat the Junsik and Sehoon to the nice meal. Her personality is just so gentle and she seems like a sweetheart. Side note: I wanted to punch my screen when Sehoon thought she stole time away from him to hit on Jiyeon. Ungrateful brat lmao.\n4. I actually like Jiyeon. She's reserved and quiet and studious, and I can relate to that. She adds spice to the show just being her simple self.\n5. I don't mind that Jintaek hopped ship to Jiyeon. What bothered me was that he made  strong statements about commitment to Soyeon and then threw it out the window. Either he's an idiot and didn't see the bigger picture of the show, or is a fckboi as well and knows how to play with someone's feelings.\n6. Junsik and Hyeonjoong are truly bland and I don't have any strong opinions yet.\n7. Don't really care for the love triangle between Jia-Hyeonjoong-Sihun. I feel like Jia's just playing the field and won't make any commitment to anyone. I mean, she can do better than either of them and she knows that lmao.\n8. Jia is really stunning and the amount of effort she puts into her appearance is admirable and I can totally see why the guys like her. But she's by far the hardest to relate to and I guess that's why she's my least favorite among the girls.",

Its not like Jintaek betrayed Sohyeon and started aggressively flirting with Jiyeon. Speaking too highly about your previous date would not be really appropriate on a date with another girl so I guess he slightly downplayed his date with Soyeon to not make things awkward. I think the scene that is most indicative of Jin taek's character is when Hyeonjoong talks about how nice of a person Jintaek is. Also, I dont get the love for Jia in these comments. She only chose Hyeonjoong for his body and veins, even tho they didnt seem to really have chemistry.",

She relied on that too much. She may not initially have been interested in him but you could see she was showing more interest after their time together. She couldn't even look him in the eyes when he came back.\n\nI guess for her to hear that he did actually have interest in Jiyeon, Soyeon  got a bit of a reality check and thought maybe shouldn't leave all her eggs in one basket and just rely on his initial statements to her. So, her actions make sense to me.\n\ntbh she didn't even make any moves on sehoon until after her convo with Jintaek and discussing with Yewon - who was the one suggested to her take the initiative with Sehoon.\n\nRegardless, Jin Taek is getting too much hate.\n\nI don't think anyone else really matches with Seoyeon, Jin Taek seems like the closest fit so I do feel bad that she may have a hard time.",

(But i guess this IS a game).&gt;!Meanwhile she's got 2 guys wrapped around her finger so actually it's really impressive (wow she needs to give classes on youtube),!&lt; plus i really love her clothes/bags. I'm not sure why Yea-Won is not more popular actually, she's totally very very very hot and her face is great too. I used to root for Jin Taek, &gt;!but not anymore, he really gives off player douchebag vibes :/!&lt;\n\nalso, sehoon is really giving me those \"i'm such a nice guy, why doesn't she like me &gt;!(but meanwhile acts quite overboard/borderline creepy and doesn't take the hint)!&lt;\" vibes, and i dont really like it.

Yet when he is with Jiyeon he\u2019s also flirting and saying all the stuff Jiyeon likes to hear.

I don't like how wishy washy jintaek is. Also he love bombed her at the beginning. I don't think jintaek likes jiyeon, he's just playing hard to get/being secretive with soyeon about jiyeon because he's toxic. Hyeonjoong is the best match for soyeon personality wise. \n\n-sihun and Jia are a good personality match but I don't think they're the ideal match if this was outside the island. \n\n-hyeonjoong is really respectful but he's uptight. sihun says he will wait for Jia but seems to not be aware of how him following hyeonjoong and Jia comes off. His actions are super annoying, like he's not aware of his surroundings. I think hyeonjoong will see this as disrespectful too. Edited to add: seeing how uptight HJ is, if he blows up over how uncooperative sihun is to giving them space, it's going to make Jia prefer sihun. Sihun's actions are an unintentional trap waiting to happen. HJ already seemed salty when he made the passive aggressive comment about how he has to wait too. But even though it's unfair, if he keeps doing that it's going to turn Jia off. I hate people like Sihun who don't pay attention to how their actions affect others.\n\n-I can't figure out jiyeon's personality. she seems conflict avoidant as she fake smiles and feigns interest a lot (at hotel with jintaek). I think they both chose someone they thought wouldn't choose them back and then they both didn't admit it.\n\n-sehoon &amp; hyeonjoong seem like they have ego problems. like they can't let go. jintaek and sihun are similar in that they have low empathy and focus on their own emotions over others' (eg. sihun said he doesn't care if the girl he likes likes someone else to jiyeon).\n\n-also I don't see the appeal of Jia's personality. maybe because I'm not her opposite type so she doesn't attract me",

I'm assuming the folks in the tents can hear the people calling out their selections at the fire pit, so Jiyeon would have known that the only men left were Sehoon, Hyeonjoong, and Jintaek.  Jiyeon could reasonably guess that Hyeonjoong would choose her, but she didn't want to have conflict with Jia.  That just left Jintaek.  She probably guessed that he would never choose Jia. He couldn't choose Soyeon.  That left her or Yeawon as Jintaek's selection.  I guess that Jiyeon thought that the situation with Soyeon could be more easily managed than with butting up against Jia.",

Everyone encounters rejection at some point, and usually develop a healthy set of emotional learnings as a result. \n\nThere are two reasons why someone would ever say they never get rejected: Either they never attempt anything that would lead to rejection, or they are some kind of heavy narcissist with a complete lack of empathy.  Both of which are very clear reasons for stearing clear of them.",

My thoughts:\n\nSo interesting reading everyone's comments BUT I don't get the hate against JinTaek, obviously SY was not interested him from the beginning. He was coming on strong to her since the beginning and she should've been transparent &amp; honest w/him that she was interested in Sehoon. She was so smitten over the postcard Sehoon sent in the beginning and was constantly and still is constantly talking him up. JinTaek was grateful that he got chosen and wasn't going to say anything to make JY feel like she wasn't adored. He's clearly one of the smartest guys on the island, he knows by now after spending time w/SY in paradise that she doesn't like him and now he's trying to deflect it. Some people are naturally flirty and eager to please, that doesn't mean they are snakes. If he was, he'd be far more direct. There's a reason all the guys like him and he's also flirty with them, esp when he winked at one of the guys who said they want to go to paradise with him. I don't see him being anywhere near as manipulative as Jia and Sihun have been. &gt;!Sihun dropped JY like a hot potato!&lt;.\n\nI've not been following Kpop so when I first saw Jia, I def was turned off by her plastic looking face. I didn't like her snotty comment in her intro where she said \"no girl can beat me.\" Honestly, everyone loving her and hating on all the other people seem to be perpetuating and feeding into the empowerment of the mean girl/materialistic girl. She does have great fashion-sense and is authentically herself but I don't get why she's the most popular. JY &amp; Yea-Won are far more likable and grounded.\n\nJY appears boring and bland because the show and the guys are intent on putting her into that innocence box. She's clearly got more personality than everyone is giving her credit for. There are more parts that they're not even showing us - like how they were all in the tent together and making jokes.\n\nFavorites: SY - she's got skills and she's mature, kind &amp; sympathetic, &amp; JinTaek because he actually seems wise and not shallow.\n\nLeast favorites: Sihun - I think he's the real snake. He wants a trophy  (Jia) to boost his ego because he's so obviously insecure. Junsik is also a super boring guy that doesn't understand how hot YeaWon really is. &gt;!I think he's just on there to promote his ginseng business.!&lt;",

Most of his responses were light-hearted and fun, playing to the reason that Jiyeon gave for choosing him to go to Paradise.\n\nI thought it was important that there was zero footage of Jintaek/Jiyeon outside the livingroom.  Even the skincare masks were prepped &amp; applied in the livingroom.  By comparison, Sihun/Jia were seen in the pool, and we had glimpses of Junsik/Yeawon lounging in the hot tub/jacuzzi.  I suspect that Jintaek wanted to make sure there was absolutely no skinship shots.  I have the sincere feeling that Jintaek prefers Soyeon above all the other women in the show (so far).",

Jintaek for obvious reasons, and Jiyeon for her bland personality. tbh she doesnt exactly radiate the vibes of someone majoring in neuroscience.\n\ni really dig all the snippets of the left behind gangs. they looked like they were enjoying one another's company and the conversations flowed more naturally and genuinely. Yeawon initially struck me as a snobbish, larger than life girl, but a few episodes in and she turned out to be so laidback and mature in her own way.\n\noverall, im enjoying the show so far. be it scripted or not, its def a fresh breath of air from Western dating shows where sparks fly every so often and contestants' interspersed interviews strip away the fun that could've been had. in SI, commentaries are strictly made by the hosting panel, so there is ample room for flexible interpretation from the participants' microgestures and expressions.",

She has a good personality, a beautiful face, and a nice body. Even as a girl I would be awestruck by her in some scenes and I would think \"wooow she's so pretty\" and IMO I feel it would've been more interesting to see her in Jiyeon's position.

But I'm a bit disappointed and sad for Soyeon.\n\nJintaek and Soyeon- I shipped them since the first ep \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. I feel like Jintaek and Soyeon has become awkward and idk if they would try again or there might be some changes. Jintaek kinda seems like a player now tho and I'm not quite fond of it.\n\nSehoon - I feel bad for him since he's the only one who have not went to paradise. Hopefully with the new addition another girl he will finally be with someone who likes him back. \n\nSoyeon and Sehoon - I doubt Soyeon and Sehoon will get tgt but if they do i feel like its out of pity and i can only see them as good friends :(. \n\nSihun and Jia - I think Sihun has shown his cute side and I like that about him but I feel like he's a simp for Jia and he should tone it down a bit more lol (but who wouldnt simp for Jia amiright?)\n\nHyeonjoong and Jia-  They look good with each other but I think if they would go to paradise the second time they can get closer to each other from their convo. I'm rooting for them however i feel like Jia would choose the new guy with the tattoo next ep :/\n\nJunsik and Yaewon - rooting for them since ep 1!! I really hope they end up together but I feel like Yaewon rlly likes him but idk about Junsik hopefully they got closer and feels the same way next ep.\n\nI cant wait for next week I can already feel there will be many changes \ud83e\udd72",

            "comment": "As someone who goes on too much dates for her own good, i have to say that I have the same personality as JiA when it comes to dating. So here\u2019s my evaluation. \n\nJintaek and Jiyeon combi shocked me. I got a feeling she just picks Jintaek as is left to chose between Jintaek and JH. It\u2019s obvious that she doesn\u2019t wanna pick Sehoon as she seems super uncomfortable with him. Honestly, all the actions that Jiyeon portrayed is actually morally good. I get how she\u2019s feeling, she didn\u2019t want to lead Sehoon on, who was being too obsessive imo. but Jintaek just gives me sneaky vibes. Especially when Jiyeon asked him about Soyeon, he literally DODGED the question and complimented her. Even commented she\u2019s a big eater, what the hell??? Jiyeon isn\u2019t dumb, you could tell that she knows what Jintaek is trying to pull when he answered her. Also, I feel like Jiyeon regretted choosing Jintaek. You can see how she\u2019s sitting at the far end of the couch everytime, while Jintaek keeps trying to scoot over. \n\n\nJiA, seriously, she\u2019s really smart with her words. I definitely would have fallen for her if I was into girls. I\u2019ve never met someone as smart and smooth with her words. She has a mysterious vibe as you realise, her response are often short, only 1-2 sentences. Her sentences are filled with hints and it leaves you with many questions and possibilities. See how she gives Sihun the hint, \u2018we didn\u2019t speak as much as I did with you\u2019. This answer was honestly smart. That sentence gave Sihun the hope to continue waiting for her. Man her sentences are smoother than Jintaek the creepy man. \n\nAs for JH, honestly, he has the same bland personality as Jiyeon. He just seems to be the type of guy that wants girls to go after him. He doesn\u2019t initiate or bother to engage with other girls. But you do see him talking a lot to Soyeon. Because it just seems like he definitely won\u2019t be interested in her, hence he\u2019s talking a lot to her as he only sees her as nothing but a friend. But he\u2019s probably acting like that because he\u2019s frequently being chased by girls outside, thus he\u2019s used to not imitating that much. JiA will probably be the girl that makes him initiate the most in his life. \n\nAs for Sihun, initially he does seems to be interested in JiA. But, Jiyeon has a bland personality, she reacts and initiates most of their conversation. She also seemed to be more enthusiastic than him. As a result, he probably doesn\u2019t feel the need to chase her or initiate conversation with her as she seems interested in him. When there isn\u2019t the chase, it seems more boring and not exciting isn\u2019t it? Thus, he feels more appealed to JiA, whose really mysterious with her words, and seems more exciting to chase. \n\nFor Jisuk and Yaewon. Honestly, Jisuk seems to only match with her just for the trip to paradise. He just doesn\u2019t seemed to be interested in her, there\u2019s zero chemistry although yaewon tries to flirt with him. He just wasn\u2019t as interested. Yaewon is also really smart, but JiA comes first hahaha. Not much screen time about this two, so I couldn\u2019t tell as much. \n\nSehoon, this guy is honestly nice. But he\u2019s too nice to everyone, feels like he\u2019s the father of the group. He also has the kind of vibes that wouldn\u2019t attract many girls to be honest. And for someone that just met Jiyeon for a few days? He\u2019s being too obsessive that it scares Jiyeon away. He should have taken it slow and kept his options open. \n\nSoyeon, another Sehoon imo. But i love her, she seems to be the most natural and authentic out of the group. From the spoilers, I feel like Sehoon won\u2019t be interested in her. Hopefully they\u2019ll bring in another guy that\u2019ll appreciate her.",

There are 10 episodes in total.\n\nAs for VIU subs. VIU announced on social media that they will release the episodes a day after they air. Last week with almost 8 hours of content to subtitle, that took a bit longer. Both episodes this week are again 2 hours long, so I would expect either late Thursday or early Friday.",

For example GHMC S1 was recut to be 4 1.5h-2h episodes instead of 16 small ones for the TV broadcast. But that happened months after the episodes initally released on TVING.\n\nAlso don't confuse [tvN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TvN_%28South_Korean_TV_channel%29) (Korea) with [tvN Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TvN_%28Asian_TV_channel%29). tvN Asia has previously aired TVING originals as they come out with anywhere from 1-4 weeks of delay.",

The moment they run out of time, they are checked out.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Chloe (Idol, Member of 'cignature')\n* Hong Jinho (Former Pro Gamer, Poker Player, Winner of 'The Genius')\n* Hwang Jeseong (Comedian)\n* John Park (Singer, Dreamboat)\n* Joo Eonkyu (YouTuber, Creator of 'Sinsaimdang')\n* Kim Hyunkyu (Actor)\n* Kim Namhee (Announcer)\n* Layone (Rapper)\n* Monika (Dancer, Leader of 'PROWDMON')\n* Shin Jiyeon (Student, Cast Member from 'Single's Inferno')\n\n# Notes\n\nSo my old account got nuked, my current leading theory is that I got reported by Dex fans because I was disagreeing with them in the latest post for Game of Blood, which put me on thin ice with reddit's automated spam filters, and this post couldn't skate by the filter. If I'm unable to post new GOB episodes anymore, I hope those people are happy lmao. It doesn't seem to have been for copyright infringement since everything I've ever posted got taken down, not just specific posts.\n\nEDIT: I appealed my ban and my original account (SharpShark222) should be usable again for future posts! (Hopefully this one will get unbanned as well, since it got caught in the crossfire as well)",

They focused half the show on an annoying guy who turned out to be a scammer, but they still edited it so he was a main part of the show. Too many games are not about the gameplay but about running fast. \n\nWhen they played Avalon, it was way too obvious that they could never beat Hong Jinho. People like Shin Jiyeon and Hwang Jesung clearly never played Avalon, but anyone who is into board games like HJH definitely would have played it and known the strategy. Also, playing 7 people with Oberon (Chloe) is not balanced, so Jiyeon-Jesung-Chloe team was already screwed from the beginning.",

According to Korean law, there is generally a non-compete for selling of a business. However, he was able to figure out that legally YouTube channels are not considered to be a competitor since the business not based in a certain city, so he immediately started a new YouTube channel. The YouTube channel he sold used to get 300k per video, now it\u2019s a total flop and gets 5k per video.\n\nHis second scam is his new company which is an \u201cAI\u201d company for YouTubers. Basically their \u201cAI\u201d would scrape YouTube videos and copy them exactly aka plagiarism. There was multiple arguments/apology videos back and forth until they finally closed the company. \n\nA lot of his content is based on how to get rich, so that should tell you what kind of person he is. Usually these kinds of people are scammers.",

There was a bit of a scare when John all inned but Jinho read him like a book. Hopefully Je Seong wins game 3 so we get to see all 4 games, but John or Jinho winning is fine too.",

People thought Jinho should win this because he played the game before but to be fair, I doubt Jinho had even played Gyul! Hap! or anything similar to it after Season 1. Also, it\u2019s probably so many years since he saw the last Gyul! Hap! game (Season 4 which is 2015!!!). If he didn\u2019t have any interest in the game and played it regularly, I don\u2019t think he would miraculously perform any better than 10 years ago. I also played it pretty often like 2-3 years ago and still take quite some time to get the feeling back again. We should applaud John though for playing it pretty well (as expected).!&lt;\n\n&gt;! Don\u2019t get the complain about the checked out players sabotaged cards because as we can see, the game didn\u2019t become unplayable at all, you just need some informations from other players to guess fake cards and switched them out. John might be struggling a bit due to confusion from unexpected answer but he worked it out in the end. Jinho also cleared his fake cards instantly but Jeseong on the other hand literally used \u201c6 hours\u201d recklessly and still came up with nothing advantages. Even after some combinations from Jinho/John showed that Eunkyu and Namhee gave him a real card, he still chose to buy the item to check their cards too. Pretty disappointed by his gameplay in first round but I get that game like this isn\u2019t his strong suit.!&lt;\n\nGame 2: &gt;!Rabbit Gold Silver Bronze!&lt;\n\n&gt;! What can I say it more than that this is just a live lesson of \u201cJinho Masterclass\u201d. Both John and Jeseong had shown an obvious and bad pokerfaces which you can literally easily tell. Also an inexperienced in playing poker was clearly shown and Jinho read them like a book. Nothing to comment much here !&lt;\n\nNext week, &gt;! seems like it could potentially go to the last game so Jeseong might finally wake up and won the third game? If it\u2019s not and there will only be one game then it must be a very long game and need more patient. So I hope the final game(s) will be even more interesting and exciting. !&lt;",

            "comment": "Whew, looks like my account is back in action, nice.\n\nSo for this episode I was super hyped.\n\nWhen I heard the format and saw the initial game, I thought &gt;!Jinho would be the massive favourite to win, given he has such a wide variety of strengths and he even has experience in the first game, which is infamously tricky for players to wrap their heads around. Unfortunately, I think my hopes were a bit too high because I forgot that even though it feels like yesterday for me, it's been the better part of a decade since Jinho has last seen this game lmao. He still did well, but John was just really clutch with his analytical skills, although I do think in retrospect that the fake information wasn't as big a hurdle as it seems to be on its surface (since you can deduce a lot of cards easily by just looking at correct combos and comparing confident/confirmed information). And John also did catch probably quite a lucky break with that random check he scored with 2 fake cards lmao. But it still feels like we're finally getting a good chance to see Jinho's skills in action, given how he just barely lost R1 and then dominated R2, but I'm excited to see Jeseong and John in action as well.!&lt;\n\nBut I also wanna say that I feel like it's a testament to &gt;!Jinho's social skills that despite being probably the favourite to win and the consistent No. 1 threat, he got the least number of sabotages from the eliminated players. How good must your social game be to be THAT big of a threat and still have THAT many people sabotaging your opponents lmao.!&lt;\n\nVery excited to see how E10 pans out, it's probably obvious who I'm rooting for, but I'll be happy with any winner so long as they win with a solid individual performance unlike how a few other shows of this type sometimes end.",

Befitting a poker champion, he definitely played it well - the defensive strategy of constantly folding was a good one as it both used up the opponents\u2019 gold rabbits and withheld information. John\u2019s bluff came as a surprise, but definitely admire his guts.!&lt;\n\nAlso! The first game &gt;!immediately reminded me of Gyul Hap - it was one of my fav games of TG. Unsurprisingly, John did amazing at it, despite having the worst possible hand - he\u2019s proven time and again to be very sharp and keen at these sorts of puzzles.!&lt;\n\nCan\u2019t wait for the last ep!",

I can't believe JinHo is still so clueless on Gyul!Hap! after all the years. This isn't any big brain game especially without the need of counting the totals Haps and find the correct turns calling for Gyul. You literally can't miss if follow the proper simple steps. Don't even bother comment Jaesung cause he is just hopeless. Wasted 6 hours and couldn't even get one correct answer. Huge props to John Park that he played beautifully though.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Design wise, not only they just uninspiringly recycle Gyul!Hap!, but actually make it worse by the interference from those eliminated being so big that the game becomes unplayable. John Park simply can't do shit if the other two are somewhat normal.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!As for second game, some people might think JinHo smartly outplay others or something. But this is just some daily Reg vs Fish at micro stakes. You just need to play ABC poker against fish. Still, JinHo made no mistake and fully deserved the win!&lt;",

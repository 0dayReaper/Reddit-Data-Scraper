You can see how much a person values hard work and just know they didn't get to where they were without effort. In a similar vein, you can see how much Jang Woo wants Paik-ssn to acknowledge him and his ability to help both hall and kitchen teams means he's def had that kind of work experience before. Honestly, coupled with Yuri and both the part timers, I'm glad Paik-ssn has such a capable team for him this time, makes for less stressful viewing.",

            "comment": "Since nobody's actually made a counter argument yet, I'm going to try and raise one. It feels like the central focus of The Genius Paik isn't to show off Korean food in an unorthodox setting as we are used to with Na PD's Kitchen series or some of Paik Jong Won's other shows. A lot of those other travel shows usually feature a cast of non-professionals and as such, it's more important to them that they deliver an experience for the short term banking on the novelty rather than go in with a mindset of starting a restaurant. For TGP, it's all about business acumen first and details second.\n\nAlso, from PJW's pov, I reckon he thinks accommodating the locals is the easiest way to get them to try the restaurant and recommend it to others. Do I personally think them going for gnocchi instead of tteok is important? Honestly, no and while there is a difference, I don't think it's noticeable enough for the vast majority of people. You can argue some people that've gushed about how great trying Korean food is in the show would feel cheated since it's not fully authentic but even then there's points to be made about what constitutes full authenticity. If I order Yopokki from Amazon or use nian gao (chinese rice cakes) to sub for tteok, some could argue it's not proper tteokbokki.\n\nLastly, I think it's important to note that in the show, the best restaurant by far there is genuine Italian cuisine and the second is the Japanese fusion one. While you can't beat authenticity, especially in a city like Naples, it is telling that the only one close to competing with first place is the guy who determinedly goes to a rival start up, likely knowing it's temporary, and tastes all the different dishes throughout multiple days to try to glean something from them. Even his daughter, despite leaving some nice comments about the food, gushes the most about how well Baekbanjip markets itself. \n\nAnyways, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. Joke aside, I want to emphasize I don't disagree with you wanting the show to be more authentic, I only saw one other comment agreeing with you and couldn't help myself to try to raise a counterargument. I'm very much enjoying The Genius Paik in Naples (just gonna ignore what a mess the Morocco one was) and it's great that you and a few others are enjoying the show also.",

                    "comment": "To add on to your point, Paik himself did explain in Ep 1 or 2 that importing Korean products is off the table since his whole aim was to minimise costs, which is in line with the business acumen idea that this whole show is selling.\n\nAuthenticity was never on the cards, especially when they showed him replicating the taste of gochujang from the local sauces in the supermarket. I do think one of the appeals of the show is the creativity in how Paik substitutes Korean products with local produce, although the gnocchi didnt come out great. But considering how he is on a tight timeline, I feel that he has delivered a mostly fantastic dining experience for the customers, just not an authentic one lol.",

But it's just that they are also marketing their restaurant as Korean restaurant offering Korean food. And constantly, Naples and the local described as people who wants authentic food. \nI feel that they pushed it too far with that gnocchi in tteokbokki sauce (also mentioned by one of the diners).  Mashed potato, flour and eggs...Ugh. It's too far off from rice cake. \n\nSpeaking of Na PD's team, they did offer tteokbokki in Mexico. \ud83d\ude01\n\nBut I still enjoy watching the show.",

            "comment": "I don't know why some of you want it to be authentic. Here's my pov of this show:\n\n1. They're on a tight budget. Remember, all their earnings are used for ingredients, rent, marketing, house rent, etc. They're truly showing how it's done from ground up. \n\n2. If they'll use the original ingredients for cooking, what do you think will happen? They have to set higher price than the average meal prices on the market especially the ones they're competing with. The result? Customers will shy away from them coz of the cost. They may have a swarm of peeps the first time, but that'll eventually lessen as time goes by. If you noticed, most of their customers were students and office workers. \n\n3. Their aim was to earn while utilising the local foods for ingredients to give the italians that familiarity with the food they're used to eat. It's better to improvise on the spot rather than remove a meal from the menu because the ingredient wasn't available if they pushed for authentic one. Besides, the meal is still have that authenticity regardless of the absence of some korean ingredients. More so, it gives paik more options. Businesssmen need to adapt and that's what he did.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad how the business is going. Mr paik knows, he has the experience. He wasn't there to play. He wants to win the tastebuds of italians so he can introduce more food.\n\nHehehe there goes my two cents. Let's just appreciate the show foe what it is. When you ran a business, it's hard to give it all coz of some limitations. They're working hard to promote the food. \ud83e\udd70",

            "comment": "I really hate tteok but love gnocchi so this tteukbokki is more up my alley. I'd agree its deceitful marketing saying you're authentic in most cases but given the difficulty and cost of some ingriedients to be exported, I'll give it a pass since they don't improvise on all the ingredients. Authentic or not they're loving it. They have a monopoly in the area and using it to their advantage. Good for business sales. I really liked the soccer analogies they used with Paik improving restaurant operations and efficiency. I wonder what's Paik's breaking point for accommodating everyone's food intolerances are given that it slows things in the kitchen due to limited space. He had to think and was lucky he had leftover chicken this time around.  They literally had the menu on the door where they wrote their names and all that time waiting never saw it?!",

I guess inadvertently labeling yourselves as the only Korean restaurant in Naples could've given off that kind of sentiment regardless. Also, agreed about the minimizing costs. It doesn't matter in the short term but PJW made it an explicit point to try to push the idea that he's simulating running a business from scratch. I reckon once he settles down and if he were to actually start a business there (which isn't within the scope of the show obv), I'm sure he'd figure out a deal to export ingredients he would need and work on more traditional Korean dishes. The problem about having so many different dishes like you said is it could get confusing and prep is already hard enough. I can't imagine being the lone cook in that sitch; you would've seen me meltdown like that scene in The Bear.",

They didn\u2019t host multiple groups of dining customers at once who have specific consumerist demands and expectations that are tailored to their socio-cultural setting. Lastly, making knife-cut noodle is not easy and realistic when there\u2019s only one chef who preps and cooks almost everything. If they do so, not only that Paik would have no time to sleep, the price of those dishes would significantly increase. Not to mention, they might run out in the middle of lunch rush. Too many problems they could have run into.",

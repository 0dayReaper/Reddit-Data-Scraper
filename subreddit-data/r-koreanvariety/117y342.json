Best of all, he has the best sportsmanahip in my opinion. I started rooting for him when he gave up his first choice of game to his teammate, and effortlessly won his second choice.\n\nCongratulations Woo Jinyong!",

A very worthy winner overall IMO.\n\n\nI don't really have any issue with any of the challenges themselves, but I think an easy fix to be more fair is to have the first three challenges to be taken by all five players, and then whoever ranked the Top 2 overall after those challenges would move to the finals. The first two challenges are disappointing because it was very clear who was disadvantaged and most likely to get eliminated so there was no real tension. This issue could've been avoided had there been no elimination right away.\n\n\nAlso note that I find it a bit weird that the finale didn't have both biggest names (Sung-hoon and Sung-bin) among the viewing audience which kind of made me a tiny bit suspicious whether they weren't meant to make it to the finals anyway.",

The first challenge was very unfair, anyone near the big guy was going to get second/third place quite easily, unless they weighted very little, the ice climber almost got 4th against the guy that started close to the 2nd place, really shows the advantage he had.\n\nFor the second challenge, I think we all could tell the big guy wasn't making it out of it. Really sad to see it, because seeing his semi final challenge, I think he would've done well on the last challenge.\n\nThe third challenge was the most anti-climatic one. I've done it many times in high-school, and I know how hard this is, but as a challenge in the finals where the second someone drops out it stops the game? That's really lame.\n\nNow, the last challenge, the best one imo. I'm really sad that we didn't get a timer to see how long it took them to reach the end of the rope, because it really seemed like it would go on for hours, maybe it did, but we won't know.\n\nI really enjoyed this series, and maybe, we'll get to enjoy a second season in the future!",

He was so gassed in the second challenge. Sounded like he has asthma. Probably wouldn't have made it through the third challenge either. I was kind of hoping Haemin would win out of that top 5, but I thought the winner was well deserving. He had to do the square challenge twice before the third challenge. Was also impressive how he came from behind to snatch the win from Haemin.",

I'm sure his fam is proud of him for not giving up! \n\nWJY patting his bust on the shoulder after he finished the running event \ud83e\udd7a so cute \n\nWas anyone else mesmerized by HM's thigh muscles as he ran \ud83d\udc40 one of his legs is prob the size of my body\n\nOmg will david beat goliath??? \n\nBased on the final shot of his rope, it wasn't that close of a race.\n\nThe winner was so unexpected!!!

They could have done scoring professionally and fair like for the long track speed skating allround title:\n\nAllround (per Wikipedia)\n\nThe oldest competition format still in place  is the allround event, standardized in 1892 (see History above). Skaters skate four distances (for men: 500\u00a0m, 1500\u00a0m, 5000\u00a0m, and 10,000\u00a0m), and a ranking is made up based on the times skated on all of these distances. The method ofscoring is the same for all combinations. All times are calculated back to 500\u00a0m times, so skating the 500\u00a0m in 40 seconds gives 40 points, while 1500\u00a0m (3\u00d7500\u00a0m) in 2 minutes (120 seconds, equivalent to 3\u00d740\u00a0s) also gives 40 points. Points are calculated to three decimal places, and truncation is applied; the numbers are not rounded. The skater who has the fewest points wins the competition. This system is called samalog. An allround champion may not have won a single distance\u2014such as Viktor Kosichkin in the 1962 World Championship\u2014or he may win three distances but lose the overall title.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat would have made the final much more exiting, definitely would have come to the last event with at least 3 in play, a dark horse and the outsider :P",

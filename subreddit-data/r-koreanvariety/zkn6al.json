In EDEN, social norms and customs are done away with: Contestants speak to each other informally and without the honorifics usually used in everyday Korean language. The amount of information they are able to learn about one another is also limited, meaning that hierarchies cannot form easily here!\n\nWhile the first season saw the constants having fun in the sun, the second season promises a new range of pulse-racing games and activities \u2013 with a darker and sexier vibe than the first season. Three celebrity guides \u2013 [Lee Hong Ki](https://www.instagram.com/skullhong12/), [Yoon Bomi](http://instagram.com/__yoonbomi__), and [Simeez](https://www.instagram.com/_simeez/) \u2013 are on hand to watch events unfurl at the EDEN house and provide their commentary. With the romantic vibe turned all the way up to 10, will our hosts be able to contain their excitement...as the contestants\u2019 hunt for love intensifies?\n\n# Panel\n\n- Lee Hong Gi (FT Island) [skullhong12](https://www.instagram.com/skullhong12/)\n- Yoon Bomi (A-Pink) [\\_\\_yoonbomi\\_\\_](http://instagram.com/__yoonbomi__)\n- Simeez (SWF) [_simeez](https://www.instagram.com/_simeez/)\n- Seon Ji Hyun (Eden S1) [ooooog0](https://www.instagram.com/ooooog0) - Guest panel in Ep. 3.\n- Kim Chul Min (Eden S1) [maisonchul](https://www.instagram.com/maisonchul/) - Guest panel in Ep. 4.\n\n# Cast\n\n## Men\n\n- Jo Egeon [j0ysky](https://www.instagram.com/j0ysky/) - 31 y.o., Acting tutor/instructor\n- Kim Dohyun [1031daily](https://www.instagram.com/1031daily/) - 34 y.o., Make-up artist, Race car driver (hobby)\n- Kim Soomin [ssuuuuumin_](https://www.instagram.com/ssuuuuumin_/) - 34 y.o., Restaurant CEO, Poli-Sci Sungkyunkwan University (2015)\n- Kim Kangrae [kang\\_rae\\_kim](https://www.instagram.com/kang_rae_kim/) - 25 y.o.

No one's stopping her from expressing her feelings but nothing will come out of it. It's just making her more unattractive.\n* The plan orchestrated by Soomin with Seoah only works in TV because he can excuse himself that he's doing it to make the show entertaining. It is just so manipulative and conniving, not only to the people that they want to be jealous but also to Seoah. It's not even a good strategy for her to make a clear decision who's the \"better guy\" nor a way for Lana to be attractive to him. The only good he gets from this is getting those skinship and stuff with Seoah without putting the effort that he endured with Lana.",

Nothing breaks my immersion harder than these kinds of product placements where they have to talk about some product for more than 10 seconds.  I feel bad for the cast members who draw the short-straw and have to do these scenes.\n\nFor food, it's not so bad...just a couple of half-hearted, \"Mmmm...And it's so tasty!\" that no one believes, and some quiet chewing.  But it grates on me to sit through PPL's for beverages, pseudo-medicinal supplements, electronics, or other hard goods where we absolutely know the cast members would **never** use them in real life.\n\n----\n\n&gt; \"Hey Bob, that's a nice rectal thermometer you have there!

I love Chaehee's commitment to the line, and doing her best with it.  \n\n&gt; Egeon: \"To me, you're like a little sister. A very cute sister.\"\n\n&gt; [Caption: Disappointed Chaehee]\n\n&gt; Egeon: \"Why don't you be a very cute sister to me?\"\n\n&gt; Chaehee: \"For how long?\"\n\nI'm not going to lie: Chaehee's grade-school-level seduction abilities are simultaneously adorable and cringeworthy, in the best possible way.  Her pout during the 'Disappointed Chaehee' shot was glorious!  She saw her moment, and took her best shot at him.  She's playing **The Game** the right way, and I commend her efforts!  Her scenes are a true joy to watch.\n\nI'm hoping that Chaehee goes full-on Park Ji Yoon [Coming of Age Ceremony](https://youtu.be/DzwfR2So5DU?t=93) all over Egeon in the next episode.\n\nIn the Ep.1 previews, they used Chaehee's line, *\"Sorry, but I'm an Oppa Killer\u2122.\"*, with some footage of Seoyeon, and at the time I was convinced that Seoyeon was going to ignore Kangrae because he wasn't old enough.  Now that we know it was actually Chaehee's line, I have some hope that we might see a Seoyeon-Kangrae pairing.  She's direct and feisty enough to train Kangrae correctly, and would probably be Kangrae's only hope for a happy ending.",

            "comment": "1) Like everyone mentioned Chae Hee was making Egeon uncomfortable and if their genders were switched then I\u2019m sure ppl would deem it much more inappropriate which is sad. Yes she said some funny and cute things but constantly invading his personal space and crossing boundaries is not a good thing ; respect the man\u2019s feelings omg. \n\n2) I like how Seo Ah is taking her time getting to know everybody instead of just picking someone in the beginning based on looks itself. It\u2019s uncommon seeing that in k- dating shows example Singles Inferno where people have their biases from the start. It made me sad Kang Rae didn\u2019t give her a lot of attention because she seemed to like him a lot!!! but some of what he said was also right; it is important to get to know everyone so you are confident in your choice. She also seems so sweet and kind to everyone and she\u2019s my favorite contestant so far! \n\n3) I appreciate Seo Yeon\u2019s honesty and openness so much! It\u2019s very refreshing. I feel ppl who come on to dating shows care too much about image (yes, i am indeed talking about the contestants on singles inferno) they rely too much on their looks alone and lose their personality as a result which can get real boring after a while. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing more of her and I\u2019d love to know if she finds the one!!\n\n4) Lana has a different personality than mine so I wasn\u2019t expecting to like her at first but she is also very cool! Her brutal honesty and banter at the beginning with Soomin was funny and i loved seeing a glimpse of her personality. But whether you agree or disagree with me I think the reason she chose Soo Min in the first game was sort of a strategic move ; and yes like she explained I\u2019m sure she also chose him bec she felt comfortable with him at the moment. But it was a bit weird for soomin to think she was absolutely interested in him just bec she chose him for the first game. Although i feel bad for Soo Min he needs to stop pursuing someone who is clearly not interested bec it is clearly uncomfortable to Lana. \n\n5) Although this move will make the show more interesting i think it was manipulative of Soo Min to ask Seo Ah to play the jealousy game with him. Him telling Seo Ah he\u2019s doing it for her so that she can see which guy seems to care about her more is him hiding his real intentions (imo). He knows Seo Ah is having a bit of a hard time connecting with the guys so of course he uses the situation to his advantage. I personally think his hidden intentions are that he wants to make Lana jealous and also wants to get closer to Seo Ah. Of course he is allowed to do both of these things but the way he\u2019s going about doing them being a bit manipulative is honestly weird and uncomfortable to watch. I personally was rooting for Soo Min in the beginning but him acting this way is making me iffy and idk how I feel about him anymore.",

Chaehee saw her chance, and leveraged what she had available (information) to further her goals.  As they would say in Poker, Egeon made a continuation bet.  I have no problem with Chaehee's play in that scene.\n\nI'm going to stand by my earlier [statements](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zkn6al/comment/j03yhli/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3): I love Chaehee's competitiveness in this show!  She's consistently positive, and is playing her heart out!  Her scenes are so fun!\n\n&gt; if their genders were switched then I\u2019m sure ppl would deem it much more inappropriate\n\nI don't think Chaehee has ever physically touched Egeon inappropriately.  And expressing one's self is all part of the dating show competition.  There's nothing wrong with Chaehee saying blatantly, in front of everyone, \"Hey, Egeon, I want to date you.  Now.  Very Hard.\"\n\nIs there a particular scene where you feel she crossed the line?\n\nOf course, if Egeon says, explicitly, \"I am uncomfortable with how aggressively you are pursuing me,\" then, yes, Chaehee needs to pull up and break off her pursuit.  But so far, Egeon hasn't said, \"Go away, I mean it.\"  The scene where he tried his best to gently let her down was beautiful, and Chaehee, for her part, did well playing the pouty, coquettish young maiden.  It was a great scene!  You couldn't have written it any better if it were a Teen K-Drama, where the female high school student was coming on to her impossibly hot, just-out-of-college, male teacher.",

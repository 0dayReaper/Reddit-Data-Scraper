    "postText": "The arrest warrant for VIXX\u2019s Ravi has been dismissed following his alleged attempt to evade military service.\n\nEarlier this year, it was reported that a group of brokers was arrested on charges of corruption to evade military service by designating their clients to a neurologist at a large hospital in Seoul and then giving them a false medical diagnosis of epilepsy to help them be exempted from military service or receive a lesser military grade. These brokers then reportedly promoted themselves by saying their services were used by a famous idol rapper.\n\nThe reports further claimed that this rapper had withdrawn from a variety show in May and enlisted in October, which lined up with Ravi\u2019s departure from \u201c2 Days &amp; 1 Night\u201d and subsequent enlistment, leading him to be named the idol in question. At the time of the reports, Ravi\u2019s agency GROOVL1N shared that they were closely examining the truth of the situation.\n\nRavi\u2019s arrest warrant was requested on March 2 by the Seoul Southern District Court\u2019s special investigation team for evasion of military service. The artist has been undergoing police investigation for allegedly evading military service through Mr. Gu, a broker who\u2019s been handed over to trial for providing fake epilepsy diagnoses to those attempting to evade military service.\n\nOn March 6, chief judge Kim Ji Sook of the Seoul Southern District Court investigated Ravi for allegedly violating the Military Service Act and examined the validity of his arrest warrant. Following the interrogation, the judge dismissed the warrant and stated, \u201cIt is difficult to determine that there is risk of fleeing or destroying evidence.\u201d\n\nAs Ravi had admitted to the charges, the judge deemed the arrest unnecessary. They explained, \u201cWhile these charges are serious, it is standard to conduct investigations of suspects without detention. In light of the objective evidence collected thus far, [the suspect] has admit to the charges. His residence and career are stable and when considering various factors, such as social ties, it\u2019s hard to say there\u2019s a need to arrest the suspect at this stage.\u201d\n\nIn relation to this case, it\u2019s said that the court has gone to trial with a total of 23 individuals, including Mr. Gu. In addition to Ravi, it\u2019s reported that over 100 individuals are currently being investigated, with some being in professional sports and the entertainment industry.\n\nLast month, rapper Nafla, who is Ravi\u2019s GROOVL1N labelmate, was arrested for allegedly violating the Military Service Act and receiving preferential treatment while serving in the military as a public service worker. The same chief judge reviewed Nafla\u2019s warrant, which was eventually deemed valid.\n\n\nhttps://www.soompi.com/article/1570839wpp/vixxs-ravis-arrest-warrant-dismissed-after-he-admits-to-charges-of-military-related-corruption",

Even if he got acquitted for extracting his teeth, he can't redeem himself because he's gotten too old after the sentencing + found guilty of delaying enlistment but he can't do anything because the court upheld his exemption.\n\nI mean I like MC Mong more than Ravi when it comes to variety shows, but Mong played himself hard. I'm quite shocked at the news when 1N2D S1 is still airing (followed by Ho Dong's tax scandal right after)",

It's sad that we can't see him in 2D1N in the future, he promised that, and the members sent him off with all the well wishes to see him again..But what can I say, it's his choice and he needs to bear the consequences of his dumb decisions.

I think maybe his fans didn't translate the next day reports which is a bit more detail than the previous day reports. And honestly we don't know to what extent is his admission, the court dismissed his arrest warrant so he doesn't need to get detained while the investigation is still ongoing.\n\nWell for Ravi, unless he has Dispatch to 'save' him like KSH, I don't think he has an easy way out from all of this mess.

I don't mean to 'downgrade' KBS and SBS Daesang winner because both Yoo Jaesuk and Shin Dongyub are more than qualified but as everyone expected Jeon Hyun moo is undeniably Daesang-worthy, just watch ILA and you can see why.\n\nCongratulations to all the winners and yeay to ILA &amp; ILA casts for bringing back lots of awards!",

But I love that MBC Daesang is just like everyone predicted and it's rightfully and undeniably belongs to JHM. It didn't happen with SBS and KBS so personally I agreed that MBC awards was more balanced.",

But there are other contenders who deserves to win this year. \n\nAs much as I watch HYDP and Running Man more, other shows from the 3 broadcast stations had a better year.\n\nAside from the contenders and winners, I would say PD Na deserves a grand award this year with Game Caterers (HYBE, SNSD, Starship, The movie promotions) Youn's Unexpected Journey and of course Earth Arcade.",

Then I would have the groups swap tasks every couple minutes. With this method you maximize the total work each person can do by switching muscle groups between pushing and pulling, and it gives the muscles a break which is needed to get rid of the lactic acid buildup so the muscles can contract fully again. \n\nI was honestly surprised at how good the second team was. Obviously, pulling at the start isn\u2019t ideal but they were pretty fast for doing it the bad way, but as soon as they got onto the logs their speed seemed much faster than the first team which only pushed. \n\nI have a feeling like the 3rd team isn\u2019t going to complete the task and is why they weren\u2019t shown this episode because it would be obvious that they lost if they failed to finish.",

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the editing but I thought the 1st team was faster than the 2nd team. The 2nd team overestimated themselves because they\u2019re all brute guys who does heavy lifting but they didn\u2019t use their brains at all. They relied too much on their strength and not about tactics on how to get the ship across. Meanwhile the 1st team had a mixed of people of strength + tactics. \n\nI am still cheering on the underdogs because everyone keeps on looking down on them but they might be in trouble because the ship is heavy af. Hopefully they think about strategy since they know they can\u2019t rely on pure strength. We can see that strength isn\u2019t everything considering how the 2nd team struggled.",

Though I did find it funny when everyone kept instigating Yun Sungbin when he just wanted to hug his couch pillow and save energy. The way Hak-seon casually grabbed his ankle was hilarious. Ma Sung-ho is such a fun character. \n\nI let out a big sigh of relief when &gt;!Euddeum!&lt; survived, and when &gt;!Da-young!&lt; didn't get severely injured. But again, with the safety... is the ship secured in any way whatsoever that it could be lifted if it godforbid fell on someone's foot? Doesn't seem like it.\n\nThe meathead team definitely wasn't playing the ship game tactically, but I am really concerned for team 3 with all the lighter folks and an injured guy. I wish there were more agility/balanced based games, like an obstacle course including some rock climbing. With games 2 &amp; 3, I can only imagine my heart dying watching all these contestants' hearts pound right out of the roof.",

I didn\u2019t know how he would fare in that game and who would ultimately be the leader, but everyone looked to him and he delivered! He strategized and also took the time to tell people to breathe during the game. \n\nYou can typically tell the difference between some of the contestants with a background in team sports/work in a team setting vs. those who are in individual sports\u2026\nThat was even more prominent this week. For Akiyama, since his day gig is just him against one other in the rink, I didn\u2019t realize he would be able to command his team so well in these games!

The sand course was a great challenge it was an equalizer because it relied on strength, endurance, agility, stamina, and strategy no one had a huge advantage based on profession or gender more challenges should be like this. It was amazing watching eunsil\u2019s team especially after all those men thought her team was a lay-up just because she had a lot of women on her team. Seeing those big burly guys be humbled by Eunsil\u2019s team was beautiful\ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude01\n\nEdit: The underdogs could survive the ship challenge if they distribute the barrels equally, wet the sand so there\u2019s less friction, and use the two pulleys on the ship especially while they\u2019re in the sand. The other teams relied solely on their strength while the underdogs have to be level-headed and pay attention to items that can be used for their advantage which the other teams completely ignored. Not a single team has used both pulleys at the sametime  or used it before getting on the ramp. If group 3 uses both pulleys early on that would be a game changer because pulleys lighten the load significantly.",

They should've just let the contestants vote or something and it's the only revival game so it's even unfairer. \n\nOr pick new captains and let them pick their team one by one to divide the remaining players fairer.\n\nI understand the guys will always be favoured but unless there's a technical element, women don't really stand a chance.

The game should have at least been something about objective strength with maybe some strategy elements so it fits more with the main quest. I get the show itself is unfair and accepted that, but this kind of just also doesn\u2019t make sense relative to the game they\u2019re being revived for. Like, \u201chey we\u2019re going to find the people who are strong for their size and kick out those who may be stronger, so we can put you in a game that requires you to be big and strong regardless of size!\u201d\n\n\n\nI will say though that the revival game was interesting in of itself, mostly in that you\u2019re physically keeping yourself alive, your bust. And if you\u2019re \u201ctoo weak\u201d to do so it falls. But as we know that game tested strength proportional to body weight which like every game has to inherently lean towards specific bodies.",

I was testing out: Franklin Gothic Medium, size 42, black outline (1.65 thickness) and shadow (1). With position settings of left 120, right 120, and vertical 30 with my subs and this seems to be really easy on the eyes.\n\nOne more thing I'd recommend is to look through the subs (presumably in aegisub if that's what you're using) and editing lines that are coloured dark red, because that means that it has way too many letters for how short it is. If you'd like help on this end, I would be more than willing to lend a hand, but yeah it seems like you guys have nailed tvN's subs.",

I tried to screen record from my phone and I still failed. The only way I haven't try is directly record from my TV using my phone. Is that how you got the subtitles?",

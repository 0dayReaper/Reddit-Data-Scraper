    "postText": "Jung Jong-yeon, the famed PD behind The Genius, Society Game, The Great Escape, and Girls' High Mystery Class, suddenly announced he is resigning from tvN.\n\nThis is despite stating his intentions to complete a Season 5 for The Great Escape and Season 3 for Girls' High Mystery Class.\n\nI would still consider this a normal resignation, until I learned the PDs behind You Quiz on the Block, Kim Min-seok and Park Geun-hyung, and the PD behind Mama The Idol, Min Cheol-gi, also resigned from tvN at the same time as Jung Jong-yeon.\n\nWhy are so many PDs suddenly resigning from tvN all at once? Did tvN do something wrong? Aren't they one of the highest paying platforms in Korea for PDs along with JTBC and Netflix?",

If it is really because of the president guesting, it moved very quickly. Hopefully they get their shit together, because it would be really unfortunate to lose all the great tvN shows just because of that dumb decision. But, there may also be bigger issues there we don't know about.",

It is a pity if they all left, since I think tvN really let the PDs do what they want. Should they are in KBS/MBC/SBS, it would be forever for approval to make a spin-off show, or even online contents.\nI think the best outcome if they decide to leave is to form their own production companies, and partner with multiple channels/streaming services to produce the show, rather than being an exclusive producer",

Public tv channels are more strict and also can be kinda annoying, but I\u2019m pretty sure any tv stations will want them as their asset so they probably are trying their best to recruit them by now. \n\nThere\u2019s also possibility that they move to JTBC, as it\u2019s also one of the big cable channel. Altho I agree with your last point, that it\u2019s probably the best for them to create their own production company but like I said before, it may be takes some time to find investors or partners. Also this is just my curiosity, but is it possible for tvN or CJ to ban all those PDs who left so they can\u2019t work anymore?",

Investors don't like when someone has strong values like these PDs do, and it also gets harder to bring on someone when they have prior issues. The Big 3 agencies also have govt connections so yeah, in general it's a mess. \n\nBut I honestly think if they group together, they'll be able to not only survive, but thrive. Hyo Jin PD is doing amazing on Netflix and I can see a lot of these PDs doing the same. In general, cable viewership is decreasing and a lot of people are moving towards streaming services, so if they do something like say, have a production company and sell the shows to others, everyone can have work.",

For years now TVN has been on top of variety, even beating out long form shows like RM, but I doubt it'll be the case now. I guess I'll be a JTBC stan now? lol\n\nAlso Na PD has been staying slient for a while now, probably for this same reason. He knows his word has power. If he moves to Taeho PDs company, the company will be able to get a ton of investments bc of his rep. But that has risks for himself, so he might just go to JTBC too.",

Repeating some of the stuff I said in a different comment, YJS is not just a B-list celeb who can say whatever and no one will care, he is literally the most famous person in Korea. It is not the same at all as PDs resigning where you can only somewhat assume it\u2019s because of the president. If he were to take any kind of stance against the president, he would automatically become public enemy #1 of both the president and the many people who support the president. And from the sound of this president, YJS would not come out of that unharmed. He\u2019d literally be endangering himself, his family, and the many many jobs that rely on him and his work. I know YJS is very powerful, but that will pale in comparison to the literal elected president. Anything he does will become a huge issue, and at the end of the day it\u2019s not worth proving his political standings and making a statement that will realistically in no way affect the power of the president. Anyway, not coming here to debate YJS\u2019s morals, it\u2019s just a really shitty situation all around. It\u2019s expectations like that that really shows how the execs put him in such a lose lose situation.",

This infantalizing celebrities is something I thought I'd only see in kpop communities but damn.\n\nPlease tell where anyone has infantalized YJS?  No one is making him their \"precious baby boy who must be protected at all costs\".   I'm really confused by this.\n\n\nI understand that words can be incredibly painful weapons and that you have been previously hurt by a similar politician.  However, you and I don't live in Korea.  It's very easy for us to say this is the right thing for him to do without considering the nuances of the Korean culture and this particular situation.   We have no clue what all the pressures are being placed on YJS.  I, with my limited understanding, can imagine at least 15 scenarios that would end up with him doing the show even if he didn't want to- someone of those would involve family pressure not business.\n\n&gt;As a marginalized person, I can say that when it counts, action really does speak louder than words, eh?\n\nNot every single action is about what we think it is about.  Please try to look at things from a different view, even if you don't agree with that view.  People are almost never black or white but rather a crazy kaleidoscope of shades of gray.",

            "comment": "Dude this is super serious and can cause like a mass resignation wave. Yoon is using entertainment as his image cleanser and you thought he learnt better after spreading that BTS is going to perform at his inauguration, nope, he be going after the Nations MC now and puts him in a chokehold. \n\nIt seems like Yoon is trying to make tvN \"his\" Fox News equivalent, a station that reflects him and his ideals and parrots after him. Think about his and his party's view of women and minorities, even the country's history. No \"Youth Of May\"-esque or female centric dramas if what I'm thinking is true. I hope it ain't but you never know these type of people. \n\nThats why these big PDs are resigning, probably. Because they don't stand by him and don't want to have anything to do with him.",

Over the next few months, we'll definitely be seeing him slowly spread over the entertainment industry. Which I hate because variety shows were one of the only places where politics and drama barely occurred, and within a few days, it's been a mess. \n\nOn a side note, SNL is now on an independent network, can they flame him already? Gag Con was on KBS and they *still* semi dissed Moon, this mess deserves a scathing variety skit.",

As a talk show host, i dont see whats the problem for jaesuk to interview the president, in fact most shows would be dying to get such a guest. \n\nIn a real world view, offending him would probably be pretty bad for TVN since his influence is huge now. I read that his policies seem to be against females but besides that i am not sure what other people are angry about. Rejecting him would probably also lead to his supporters attacking the show, theres just no way to win.",

    "postText": "I stumbled across a clip on Youtube from Sixth Sense and it sent me down the rabbit hole of re-watching Season 2 (personally my favorite). I know no one has a crystal ball that they can predict with - but what is the probability of season 4 happening - should I be even hopeful? I feel like it would've been announced already considering after S1 aired, they started filming almost two months later for S2. S3 was already announced in Dec 2021. This is the only time there's no news about season 4 which is quite disappointing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that there is some controversy whether a new season should happen or not - quite frankly I don't really care if they keep the same format, I think there's many things they can change to the over all concept (e.g doesn't have to be restaurants or groundbreaking every time) to lower production cost. People will still watch, it's not really the ideas that keep people coming back, it's 100% the cast.  I know that one of the main deterrents may be the amount of money nd time that is spent creating sets to seem believable. \n\nWhat do you think...Should there be a season 4 &amp; what are the chances? If so, is it ok to keep the same format or what should they do differently?",

Sixth Sense format got old for me and the members got pretty good at guessing the right answer too. But it's shame to lose that cast. They all worked well together. It's unlikely we'll see the whole cast doing a variety show together again.",

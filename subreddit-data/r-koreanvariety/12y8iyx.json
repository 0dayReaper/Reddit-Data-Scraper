I'm waiting for someone to upload a full episode and then I will make a report for yall. Well, unless yall dont mind a short report based on YT vids only. (Let me know down below).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we are getting to episode 90 of Lets Play Soccer after a few months of stale episodes (the 3rd audition made me so exhausted). REVENGE MATCH! Eojjeoda Avengers will play against the professional soccer team, KHNP Women's FC. Now, you may be asking what do you mean by Revenge Match? Well, well, well...... Eojjeoda Avengers got defeated in their first match against the pro Women's Soccer Team in Ep19 (You can watch the episode on Netflix and make your own judgement).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur players got defeated 0-1 contrary to the pro soccer team's prediction. For me Eojjeoda Avengers done quite well despite having weak midfielders and less call play at the time. I mean we're talking about a Pro Soccer Team here not your usual amateur soccer team. My heart is divided between winning or losing the next game after watching our last match on episode 89. I feel like we need more work on the teamwork between the old and new players. I dont know maybe they just got unlucky in the last match? They really need to find their rhythm back ASAP.\n\nAccording to the schedule, Eojjeoda Avengers will have a re-match with Gyeongsang-do soccer team tomorrow (God knows how jealous I am for K-nets). If we got lucky, we might get update from K-nets So keep praying for photos update and Eojjeoda Avengers wins.\n\nHard Work Betrays None! Eojjeoda Avengers, Fighting!\n\n(P.S. My bias can't score any goals in the last match so I'm a bit depressed. Pray for me too. Keep recruiting new fans for our soccer cult. Love yall).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Lets Play Soccer Ep 90 (Trailer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOMNFiVlN98)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\nUpdate (27 April 2023):\nIt is confirmed that Lee Jang Kun will be tested as Centreback again. AJH said LJK has more speed than Andre. Hence, the call back.\n\nCan Lee Jang Kun break his curse and show them his true potential? Or will his ball-trapping and game-sense get in the way? \n\n\n \nDont be shy, and let us know down below\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/12y8iyx)",

            "comment": "The first half of episode 89 had them looking rough, especially on the defensive end where the back line was just getting torched over and over. Andre played probably his worst game.  Plus, there were two new defenders which I think really messed with cohesion as far as keeping the line where it needed to be. It was a rough first half, but you could see the team warm up, get used to each other, and play fairly well in the second half. This team tends to do this a lot after a big win over an over matched squad. They come out a bit flat and when a good team is motivated to show off on TV it hits them before they can warm up and grasp the flow of the game.\n\nI think that may be one of the biggest struggles for the producers and the coaches is to find a balance when it comes to opponents. It is really hard to go from a team that is simply physically unable to compete to a team that has both skills and physical capabilities the next week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll that said, I think this team is light years ahead of where they were in episode 19. I would be shocked if they don't win by at least 2-3 over the women's team. The best soccer team in the world was the U.S. women's team and when they were ranked #1 they got slaughtered by the u17 boys team, because they just couldn't match up physically. I think the women's professional team will be more skilled and better trained obviously, but the Avengers are just going to be too much. I actually think that the Avengers probably won't play as physically as they did this week or previous weeks against men's teams, but will still win fairly comfortably. The physical differences will just be too much.  \n\n\nP.S. Both teams in ep 89 missed really solid scoring opportunities, but I think the Avengers blew about 5-6 \"sure thing\" type shots. If both teams scored when they \"should have\" the score would have been something like 6-5...not sure which team.  They didn't play as bad as the score indicated and FC Sun played a super aggressive style.  So the Avengers needed to counter that by scoring with all the open chances they got.  They just weren't hitting their shots.  But over all they were honestly not that different from FC Sun.  If they played again the next week the result could have gone the Avengers way.",

                    "comment": "I'm a lil bit disappointed in Andre. His playing is just not consistent. There are times that he's motivated and time where he's just so-so. But AJH hopes that he can improve because we dont hv much players to play in defense. What do you think abt Lee Jang Kun as defenfer tho? Some said he's better at defense than forward now, but we have to wait for the next episode if AJH will use LJK as defender. We do have lots of forward for next match because Kim Yong Sik and Kim Jun Ho are coming back for the 16 Entry System test. I bet AJH will test them until the next Title Match. \n\n\nI know right? I think AJH purposely chose strong teams to elevate and push Eojjeoda Avengers potential. When looking back at it, our players imroves quite a lot throughout the years, it's just that they lacking consistency. Do you know they usually have 1-2weeks off and after that, their performance will drop a bit. \n\nFrom what I see in Ep90 trailer, it looks like they will not spare the Women's team either. \ud83d\ude09 Yes, Eojjeoda Avengers in Ep 19 is totally diff than the current ones but one thing that is still stuck is that they are too rushing and will miss lots of good opportunities. Thats why I said they need to find their rhythm back. All that audition and this 16 Entry System thing really messed up their coordinations.\n\nIts good that you have a clear judgement on our last match. I cant really enjoy the game when my bias can't score a goal. I really need to focus more on the team than individuals. Keep it up!",

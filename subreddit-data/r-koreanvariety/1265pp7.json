    "postText": "I have a question. I'm watching ep 163 of S04 and it's not the first time they mention Dindin causes a lot of their scenes to get edited out, and that's why a lot of them don't want to be paired up with him. A lot of the morning missions as well. But I don't understand why? \n\nIn very past eps, do remember him screwing up some games early on, like when he solved the lock mistery while the game was supposed to be on (laughed so hard when he opened that door!). But I don't think is that!? Is it something he says? I didn't manage to catch the reason yet!",

            "comment": "Yeah, DinDin \"getting edited out\" has been a running gag for a while now, dating back to the beginning of the season when he was still a little uncomfortable on camera. The biggest moment was probably a while back, I think in the PD Bang era, where one of the producers was holding up a sign for him off camera saying something like \"not funny\" while he was talking during a game that the other guys called attention to.\n\nDinDin's childish sense of humor, tendency to pout, and frequent losses in the games all play into it. MSY in particular knows it's a good joke and brings it up often, even though in reality DinDin has really grown into his role on the show. You'll see a similar thing on Running Man, where members will joke about not pairing up with Seok-jin because he's seen as boring and a frequent loser - so he's presumably getting less screen time in the edits.",

The other members will joke that a certain member gets edited out often because they're not funny or they're too corny, etc. They'll also say it if a person does a game too well but fail to do it in an interesting way, or in cases of shows like Running Man which was once heavily guest-focused, the team that didn't get a guest would joke that they should plan on being fully edited out. \n\nIt's not meant to be taken seriously. It's usually something that gets attributed to one or two members in particular, and they'll go on with it for quite some time.",

I wondered if it was about the games - for example, in RM they confessed they sometimes would pretend not to know who's the spy and etc in order to keep the episode/game going. I wondered if it was something like this. In RM I understand their references, but here it was so out of nowhere that I was confused. Didn't understand it had no basis. Thank you!",

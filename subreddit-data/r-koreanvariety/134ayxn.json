The result was disappointing for Eojjeoda but considering that this is a professional football team, the outcome then was not that bad. The score then was 0-1. So for this match, it may be considered as a revenge match.\n\nFor this episode, Kim Yong Sik plays for the first time for Eojjeoda Avengers since his audition.\n\n|Startting Line Up|||||\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Goalkeeper|Defenders|Midfielder|Midfielders|Forward|\n|Han Gun Kyu|HEO Min Ho     LEE Jang Kun PARK Je eon   Jang Jeong Min|KANG Chilgu|Lee Jun Yi IM Nam-Gyu        RYU Eunkyu    LEE Daehoon|Kim Yong Sik|\n|Second Half|||||\n|Goalkeeper|Defenders|Midfielder|Midfielders|Forward|\n|Han Gun Kyu|HEO Min Ho     LEE Jang Kun PARK Je eon   Jang Jeong Min|KANG Chilgu|Lee Jun Yi IM Nam-Gyu        RYU Eunkyu    LEE Daehoon|Kim Yong Sik|\n||||||\n|Substitution|Out|In|||\n||Jang Jeong Min Park Je Eon|Mo Tae Bum   Kim Tae Sul|||\n||Kim Yong Sik|Kim Jun Ho|||\n||Kang Chilgu|Park Jun Yong|||\n\nThe following are the scored goals and assists for this match.\n\n|Goal 1|Kim Yong Sik|Assist|Ryu Eun Gyu|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Goal 2|Kim Yong Sik|Assist|Lim Nam Gyu|\n|Goal 3|Lim Nam Gyu|Assist|Heo Min Ho|\n\nFor this episode, AJH picked the next team line up.

For Kim Yong Sik, lucky or not, he still doesn't have the basic skill sets in. Pardon my language, but he looks kinda useless in a game. Always need to be fed. We will see in the next match if it's his lucky star or what else.",

He didn't really have the ball handling or positioning and needed to be fed the ball close to the goal (thankfully he could smack it in compared to Jang Kun).\n\nAgree with Jang Kun statement, tends to overthink aswell and  does that weird turn and light tap pass which always ends up getting cut or allows defenders to catch up.",

Basic Skills like passing the ball, how to position themselves to receive the ball and the most important are teamwork and call play. They need to talk more freely like Park Jun Yong in Episode 88. He gave a good direction to the players as a midfielder when Lim Nam Kyu was pressing the opponent. I cant say much for Episode 90 as the full episode is not available. \n\nFor Forward and Right/Left Wingers,  we got Lim Nam Kyu, Ryu Eun KYu, Kim Yong Sik, Kim Jun Ho, Lee Jun Yi, Kim Hyun woo, and Kim Jun Hyeon.\n\nMidfielders-Lee Dae Hoon, Kang Chil Gu, Park Jun Yong and Heo Min Ho? \n\nI think our main problem now is defense. We got Lee Jang Kun, Park Je Un, Andre Jin and Jo Won Woo as our centreback. Not sure about Right Back and Left Back, Lee Ji Hwan, Kim Tae Sul, Jang Jeong Min and Mo Tae Bum? We usually have a problem with our defense line and they need to keep practicing the defense line. It will be useless if we scored a lot but at the same time lose a few goals too. \n\nIts just my opinion. Let me know if you have a different take on it.",

Maybe this show is just a variety to some of them but some players really put their heart into soccer and it would be nice to see more of that.",

I agree to one comment here... that coaches, esp AJW only tend to see shining stars. They aren't coach materials when many of the player put their heart and soul to the game. They shake their heads when their goals are missed, but i can see they have their favorites but disregard or laugh off their errors like Lee Tae Bum, Taekwando Boy, and Park Tae Wan. It is very obvious that Nam Kyu and Ryu Goo are more talented, and skilled than their new recruits but these coaches are merely looking at potential. They may be up for disappointment.",

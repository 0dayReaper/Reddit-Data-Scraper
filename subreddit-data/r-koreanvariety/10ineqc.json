They have some eps that are free to watch but you might need to pay for the VIP membership to watch all of them. It's pretty affordable though, about USD6+ for 3 months where I'm from.\n\nYou can also watch them for free on their YT channel. Just search for Who's The Murderer, but because of music copyright, sometimes they overlay the audio with a different music or the audio gets weird and you can't hear the cast well, so I suggest watching on their own platform for a better experience.\n\nIt's really excellent. Both smart AND funny as hell. Every season has really good and interesting cases, and most of the cast members are terrific in both deduction and entertainment. Most of them are actors who have been in crime thrillers, so they give life to their characters. One of the main cast is one of China's most respected hosts who is a law post-grad from Peking University and have hosted a law docuseries for over 20 years (he goes through different crime and civil cases on it). He approaches every case like a lawyer, which gives a realistic and legal angle to the show, and I find that very interesting. He's also hilarious. Every season gets more difficult as the cast gets better and smarter too, so the format evolves and the later seasons have longer episodes. There are also themed series and jokes that run from early seasons to later seasons. That's why I suggest watching chronologically starting from S1E01 to get used to the upgrades and be on track with the jokes.\n\nJust fyi though, I'm fluent in Chinese and don't watch it with subs so I'm not sure how good their subs are, especially in translating the jokes, but it should be good enough I think.",

But a more quickly edited version of it?  I loved watching crime scene though, so Im glad they brought something similar back to the screen!!",

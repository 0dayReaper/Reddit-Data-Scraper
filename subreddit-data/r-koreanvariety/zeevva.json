RM's rating this week is lower than this new show (3.9% vs 4.6% - fr Daum) while the other competitor Boss in the Mirror is stable at 6% possibly indicating some realtime viewers are jumping from RM to this new show. RM's rating this year seems to also average to under 5% which I don't think is good esp considering the casts lineup.",

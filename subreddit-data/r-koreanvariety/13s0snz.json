Too much time-wasting from the number 1 amateur team in the country. Even the stadium audience were getting angry. I get that they wanted to win and they probably did not think being caught on cam for tv would make any difference\u2026 but was frustrated nonetheless with how the defenders would stay a few cm from the ball during the avengers\u2019 free kicks. It was just not a good look for a team with skilled players and such a ranking, and it made the game less enjoyable. The avengers\u2019 have such cool heads lol. But seeing minho crying at the end made me tear up too. He was blaming himself since he missed the goal chance that he got\u2026  i\u2019ve watched this show since season 1 and i don\u2019t remember him crying since joining. I do remember when they thought he got injured and even though they won the atmosphere was like they lost, that\u2019s how reliable he is for the team. He cut so many attacks in the first half too.",

Occasionally cuts opposing team passes but besides that his passes haven't really been connecting &amp; he hasn't been fast enough to break through or strong enough ball handling to keep the ball. Might also just be because of strong defense from the opposing team but yeah....\n\nAs you mentioned Gyu-kyu once they're marked, no one else at the front is skilled enough to make their own play for a goal.",

The usual centreback are Andre Jin, Park Je Un and sometimes Jo Won Woo. \n\nChil Gu's performance kinda dropped a bit lately. I dont think Heo Min Ho ever missed training. Here is his latest training. He's a hard worker. Seeing the present Min Ho made me forget that he was a bad player in the beginning. (I like his ball crossing the most. It looks so pretty). If I'm not mistaken, it was Min Ho choice to be a midfielder, but AJH kept using him as winger/side back before the 3rd audition started. Check episode ep 41 for more details.\n\nhttps://instagram.com/pasion_sh88?igshid=MmJiY2I4NDBkZg==\n\nI want to see more of Kyu-Ho duo. \n\nI dont think I can even watch Ep 94 again. It's so painful to watch. It's like Shin Jeju look downs on Eojjeoda Avengers. I know some might say it's a tactic, but at least take Eojjeoda Avengers seriously. Why are they smiling while blocking Eojjeoda Avengers's free kick and then ignoring the ball when it was Shin Jeju's free kick. The heck?\n\n(P.S. I hope Nam Kyu can at least assist or score a goal \ud83d\ude4f I kinda miss the old Nam Kyu, calm and confident in his shooting. But the new Nam Kyu is not bad, too. Looks like he got some speed now? I think I like him more as winger than a striker).",

I mean there was that one team before that said the avengers had nothing but kicks and would trash talk the goalies when they took a goal kick, they even got warned by the refs, but it was fine as it was just the bench trash talking\u2026 shin jeju incorporated things in their playing style. Nam Kyu had assists in the last 2 games iirc? He received the money envelope twice I think. I like how cool he is with his assists and allowing eun gyu to take the free kick, he isn\u2019t selfish at all.",

He rarely missed to score goals before, but now the ball is either flying to the sky or went sideways, which is a rare occasion for our captain.\ud83e\udd27 I guess it's normal? I dont know.

That\u2019s why chilgu has been a sub for the two games before the jeju one, because their positions overlap and AJH chose to only have one defensive midfielder. They both played in the jeju 1st half as defensive midfielders. But in the jeju second half, minho was put as an offensive midfielder with daehoon while chilgu stayed as defensive.\n\nLike nas\\_emerald00\u2019s comment, chilgu seems a bit out of it in terms of focus\u2026. Not sure if him coming in as sub instead of starter had an effect, or if he was put in as sub because he showed the same lack of focus during warm ups. a big reason why they had auditions was to fix minho in the midfield instead of as a wing, he\u2019s not very speedy. He\u2019s my favorite because he works super duper hard, he\u2019s good as defensive MF. That\u2019s what made ep 94 so hard to watch at the end, when they showed how much he worked in practice clips and also that\u2018s why his current nickname is \u201cman who is serious about football\u201d. In ep 93, he got a bit annoyed at jangkeun for not being focused enough and forgot that it was their throw in haha, that was the scariest i ever saw him\u2026 when he said \u201cget it together! LEE JANG KEUN.\u201d whole name and all.",

Some of the strategies they chose just seem unsportsmanlike to me, especially since they are kind of representing all amateur clubs on the show, due to that number 1 status. So you wanna show the audience a good game full of fair play and sportsmanship, regardless of football being a physical sport. \n\nThe amount of time wasting they did was the most frustrating (got warned a few times by the ref), and they would block players from taking free kicks by sticking right in front of the ball (got a card for it after warnings). Maybe this was the game with the most fouls and warnings.\n\nMan, even the stadium audience were getting annoyed, with people shouting at them to stop acting/rolling over and stuff. I don\u2019t believe TGL production team does evil editing necessarily, because why would they? It was a case where the editors couldn\u2019t skip over what was happening. They have games like this every week where they either lose or win, and the show aims to bring more love to football - and that extends to getting people to support these local teams. This was a jeju team with citizens of jeju watching\u2026 and I feel like normally these teams join the show more to showcase themselves in a good way, more than to win a game.",

Personally, I believe the Avengers can beat them after more training. So I want them to go back as revenge hehe",

But they still came to watch the match. \n* The kids got interviewed by the show.\n* The kids are Kyu-Gyu fans. So cute. \n* They kept saying 'Hwaiting!' to the players which means 'Fighting!' in English.\n*  They got the signed ball and the kid is so happy. (I'm so jealous of him).\n\nThe overall tone of the video sounds happy to me. I dont know if its because of the signed ball or the match. ARghh!!!! Just give us the full match already JTBC! \n\n(P.S.

(Reference to Kang Chil Gu's foul) Kang Chil Gu should have waited and worked with Park Je Un instead of committed the foul.\n* AJH said we should be like no.45 while defencing.  (Dont commit an obvious foul, be sneaky about it\ud83d\ude09)\n* AJH shows them how to draw foul from opponents, and they were laughing about Lim Nam Kyu screaming for referee \ud83d\ude06 The coaches talked about Ryu Eun Kyu, too\ud83d\ude06\n* The coaches said we need to be aware of no.45, and if the players got caught by him, it would be easier to just fall and get Penalty Kick. AJH said the players need to use their intelligence if met with no.45.\n\nBased on episode 94 trailer and this video, I think we will see lots of penalty/free kicks if the players use AJH's advice smartly.\n\nIts so funny to watch Kyu-Gyu got called out like that. I'm still not sure if we will win the match. My heart is divided after watching the trailer and this video.",

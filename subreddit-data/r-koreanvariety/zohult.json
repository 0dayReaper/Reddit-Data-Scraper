This is like them giving My little old boy a Grand Daesang when JSJ got the Honorary Employee Award. Even the mc said it's probably for the Running man so RM member can go up the stage as well. Funny, no one wants to go up and help YJS with the awkward atmosphere. Is SBS trying to bind YJS with new shows or something? MBC and KBS at least award Grand Daesang to new faces. Thanks for the most awkward Grand Daesang of the year again SBS. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

They're truly the perfect pair and they read each other's minds perrectly. A lot of their gags were spur of the moment and they each knew exactly what to do without being told. Nonetheless, really happy the Jaesuk the Daesang for Running Man. He is the pillar of it all.",

His ad-lib was weak in RM and he was teased for being the 'weak talker', so I do not see how that makes him deserving of a daesang? Last year might be acceptable as he was active in MSGW as well, but this year? \n\nAlso, lots of people said that JSJ has stepped up after RM left, but I do not feel so? I'm happy YJS wins tho it wasn't exactly what I expect, but jsj winning was truly not on my expectation list.",

Nothing change, always good at leading the flow, always entertaining. \n\nFor JSJ, well, he's improving a lot from last year but let's be real he's only in Running Man and if we compare the impact between JSJ and YJS in the program? Ofcourse YJS is having a bigger impact since he's leading the flow of the show and almost always in the middle of funny things happen or funny episode. \n\nMore bigger contender is Lee Sang Min and Tak Jae Hoon as their program is doing pretty well. They make more sense to winning the award since, well, not only one, they are on two show that doing good. Especially Lee Sang Min who almost every week appear in My Ugly Duckling. But even Lee Sang Min and Tak Jae Hoon doesnt have really a big impact this year too. \n\nI mean, if 2 people who have 2 good show doesn't even win the Daesang. How JSJ gonna win Daesang with only Running man?\n\nAs YJS is weird pick, but well, it's really a safe choice considering YJS still doing good this year and his influence also popularity.",

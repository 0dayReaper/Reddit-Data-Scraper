Those two are and have been the maknae line since they joined. \n\nAlso, why would a director think of this as appealing? They're literally making fun of her for that comment (counting herself as one of the young people). Unless the appeal is that she's going along with a joke, I don't see how this could be appealing to directors. I mean, their ages are public knowledge so a bunch of people calling including her calling her young doesn't actually change anything. \n\nIt's a horrible thing that this industry, like Hollywood and many others is so ageist and especially against women. But there are many actresses working on super popular dramas who are over 40. I'd like to see that as positive. Some of those roles are also pretty good and juicy stuff for actors. It's not like she's not getting work because there is no role for someone her age. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

The pd probably know her predicament and it seem she is taking the courage to try and be involve in the conversation sometimes but also most of the time just look awkward because she can't do it naturally like the other members. \n\nCha tae hyun, yjs are probably the most godlike in terms of just having the ability to slide into any conversation and situation naturally. Actually the rest of the other members also knows the timing and have the wit to do it whenever they see fits. Jihyo is too shy and awkward and people calling her out weeks in weeks out doesn't help her confidence although I also understand the frustration from an entertainment pov",

I'm certainly not Brad Pitt, and I suspect most of us here are not. \n\nShe is doing fine.",

                            "comment": "I totally to disagree with your second paragraph. nobody is yjs and lks, sure, but at least they give it their all and are entertaining or try. like i'm visibly not fond of ysc but even i can't deny that the episode he wasn't on (donny ep and the fo ep) it was glaring obvious he wasn't there. i'm almost certain an ep w/o sjh won't be any different from any other ep and many won't even miss or notice her not being there. I know i won't.\n\nI disagree with ur 2nd paragraph because I think she is very bad at taking punches. didn't she cry once when lizzi won in a game? (ep 20?) lol she also cried when in an ep she ruined a game. the others deliberately never mess with her bc of how sensitive she is.....like can u imagine them ever making fun of her like they do with jsm? any time a rank by look subject pops up they immediately put her on top and move on from her and then make it funny using the rest of the members. I promise you it's not because the think she's actually #1 lol.\n\nthey walk on eggshells around her either bc of her fans or bc of her being sensitive. Yjs said she calls him after the shoot asking if what she wore was inappropriate!!!! isn't that so insecure for a supposed veteran? they have called her an ajumma several times and mentioned how she looks like an older actress the name of whom i'm forgetting (they've mentioned it several times tho) and every time she looks mad and hurt by that comment. kjk once told her she looked like his aunt and she coul have rolled with that punch but instead she gave him a stare.... that same ep, jsm chose her as the ugly member who was going to take the phone and they all said \"she's gonna hate that\"\n\nand i haven't seen any improvement in her interjecting when the cast is bantering sadly. For the most part it seems like she repeats the same jokes that are either set up by the cast or have been done by the cast before, which is completely fine and even the comedians on this show have said this before that comedy is mostly repetition..... but not if that's all you do. Echoing the others stops being funny after the 5th attempt.\n\ncomparisons are unfair. so i am staying away from that but if u want i can think of 3 examples where the other cast showed their wit when made fun of like I gave examples above: haha was told he looked like an ajussi and he immediately started walking around the market (2nd fo ep shopping in the market segment) like a middle aged or old man with one hand behind his back. kjk once told jsm she looked like ysc's mom in her dress with ysc wearing a school-ish outfit and they immediately played it up by acting in a skit with her calling him \"my son\" and him acting like a child jumping in place. lastly, ysc in the winter festival ep was told he looked like a random ajussi and he went with the joke changing his stance and tone of voice or laughing at it. Not only do they not do these types of jokes with sjh, they do the opposite of it which was funny exactly 2 times lol.",

It looked like KJK stepped up, and he has succeed in my eyes; I find him really quite funny now. \n\nI get a similar feeling with SJH. I see a change over time.   \nMaybe I just \"evaluate\" her for her last episodes, which feels fairer to me?",

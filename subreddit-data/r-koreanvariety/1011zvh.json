    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nJust picked up transit love s2 a few days ago and finished ep5 recently. I\u2019ve been told that the show vaults into greatness at episode 15, so I\u2019ve been thinking about skipping forward to it now that I have a feel for who is with who (and I\u2019ve already been spoiled by final pairings).\n\nIs ep 7-14 worth watching or can I skip forward to when the final participants are introduced?",

Don't skip it, just don't, but if HE's suffering is too heartbreaking for you, you can skim through it.\n\nThis is the same for everyone else in the casts, you need to understand their journey before coming close to the end to realize and appreciate their bonds and development. Otherwise just watch some clips on youtube then, not that much different  for you if you wanna skip i guess.",

Its the same comments over and over for these episodes for me. And same complaints too. \nIt was only bearable for me because I was not binge-watching it and only have to suffer 2 hrs per episode per week. \n\nI tried rewatching it and episode 6-14 really do not carry a lot of rewatch value for me.",

    "postText": "To avid viewers/fans of 2d1n s4, I'd like to ask which episode does the member's managers appear on the show. On ep. 176/177, they had their team managers as their guests. I bingewatch s4 of 2d1n lately and I'm currently at Autumn's Best Man, ep. 96-7 as of writing and I just watched the ep.176/177 highlight from youtube so I know that their managers appeared as guest. In earlier episodes, I know that there are some episodes in which their managers where introduced and/or shown on 2d1n. The cast from that time is still the first 6 og cast. Can you help me find those episodes? Thank you so much.",

    "postText": "They just put the first season of Eden on Viki and after watching episode 1 it just seems so much better than Eden Descendants  of Instinct. I mean the hosts location seems better, it seems better quality of cast in looks and personality and even the camera quality seems much better. I know Eden 2 was a dumpster fire and totally scripted, but the original seems so much better? Am I the only one that thinks that?",

            "comment": "Personally i thought both were trash lol - I still watched both but they were bottom of the barrel for me. Maybe season 1 was slightly more authentic but it is def a show that casts mainly influencers looking for fame rather than love. I would put Eden below Single's Inferno, Heart Signal, Love Catcher etc... all those shows cast influencers but Eden is the trashiest/most fake imo.",

I think S1 caught my attention bc of how racy it was but having watched the whole thing it was just ok. \n\nAlso like TL 2 and Love Catcher in Bali were such masterpieces that my standards went up I think.",

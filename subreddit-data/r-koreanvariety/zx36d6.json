He said he felt he did his best, **that it was ok to hate him, but stop threatening his family and friends**\n\nYet that guy still GOT SO MUCH HATE online. When he got engaged later, people hurled insults at even his fiance.\n\nThis is why ppl are so gun shy about turning people down, being too flirty, or doing anything controversial, they're afraid of the hate.\n\nhttps://post.naver.com/viewer/postView.nhn?volumeNo=26357279&amp;memberNo=12029394",

Considering that's her first love, for 7 YEARS, her ex is basically her everything, her 'youth', her whole romantic experiences. He who invited her to the show after breaking up, treated her like dirt and flirted with other girls.\n\nHae Eun is rare, not many people who'd willingly accept to be in a reality show where the whole world can see her in her most vulnerable and like you said, pathetic state. And she showed it all, her tears, her thoughts, her struggles in the most honest way possible. I cannot see that as pathetic, but bravery. And that's maybe why she's loved by a lot of viewers, even before the appearance of Hyun Gyu.\n\nTo this day I still rewatch 'that scene' in the episode 5 from time to time, it's so raw and strangely beautiful, at least for me. And yep, i'm a Hae Eun fanboy, fight me.",

She is very much loved by the female community for being so real and relatable. So many iconic lines and scenes from her that felt like a kdrama, everyone couldn't help but root for her. She also reached 1 million followers which is rare and super high for dating shows. This is also considering that Transit Love wasn't aired through Netflix which makes that record even more impressive. Talking about Netflix, I'm surprised no one has mentioned **Jia** from Single's Inferno too but it makes sense since she was already 'known' before the show and had a 'scandal' which made her stop social media for a while. But in terms of reaching popularity, I still believe she is one of the cast members who definitely blew up.\n\nFor the men, it is definitely **HyunWoo** from Heart Signal 2. When I browse videos or blogs about dating shows, he is just always mentioned. He is the 'catfish' standard that everyone just refers to. As everyone mentioned, he just knows what he is doing at a very natural way too. Using my country's language, he is just so *suave*. Runner up is **HyunGyu**. I mean no words are needed, just like HyunWoo, he was very natural. To explain his greatness, just watch TL2's episode 18 ;)",

And then ya that cast is legendary for a reason.\n\nFor Heart Signal, they basically have to text each other at night to indicate who they liked or their love lines. This is where a lot of other Chinese/Korean/etc. dating shows probably got the idea.\n\nThere's also **Love Catcher 2**. Make sure to power through the episodes if you still find it boring, it's still kinda unbeatable to this day when it comes to the endings.\n\nThe fourth season of Love Catcher (third one is called Love Catcher in Seoul/\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \uc11c\uc6b8) is airing right now, it's called **Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac)**. It has the best visuals in all of these Korean/Chinese/Japanese/etc. dating shows and it's not close.\n\nFor personalities of Love Catcher in Bali, you'll probably like some of the girls, they're pretty chill and straightforward which is a bit rare compared to other dating shows. For the boys they are also pretty chill, it must be the tropical climate in Bali, lol.\n\nAnyway, Love Catcher in Bali (and a lot of other dating shows) is available on VIU, you'll probably need to set a VPN to Southeast Asia or see these thread links: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zqf0dp/singles_inferno_2_ep_3_4_20221220/j147u12/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/\n\n---\n\nThere's **Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774)** that also just finished earlier this month of December 2022. That one will probably hook you due to the secret shame concept. Like if you prefer plot and like personalities/characters/etc. over the initial visuals to naturally interest people in, then Pink Lie might be interesting or not. \n\nWhich sounds weird to say but it depends on how you can tolerate like the frustrations from certain characters, lol. There's a lot of things going on in that show though, like try to watch it all as for some it's probably one of those shows that gets better if you rewatch.\n\nSecret Man and Woman (\ube44\ubc00\ub0a8\ub140) is more low budget version of Pink Lie but some people actually prefer it or enjoyed it more, as it's got different secrets and situations and so on.\n\n**REA(L)OVE** is like the predecessor to Pink Lie and Secret Man and Woman. Long story short, REA(L)OVE can get dark and real offensive due to the hosts/panelists but they're clearly trolling, so just watch until the end if you want to see the secret shame and so on concept at its current peak (with the secret/shame/etc. concept, nothing has really topped REA(L)OVE since its Netflix release in 2018). \n\nREA(L)OVE is the funniest show dating show ever, like holy shit. This is another one of those shows that you have to watch until the end if you can bear with it, it's ridiculous af.\n\n---\n\nAt the moment the current influential dating shows in East Asia goes like this: Terrace House inspired Heart Signal and then Heart Signal inspired Transit Love/EXchange. Single\u2019s Inferno is also kinda in this as a lot of island/beach/etc. shows got made because of it.\n\nThis is some of the newer dating shows after this summer of 2022: https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/zvgqkc/the_new_guy_is_honestly_mid_to_me_his_looks_are/j1pc0ci/\n\nSome the recent Korean dating shows that appeared around the middle (before/around the summer) of 2022: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/wutb91/dating_shows_currently_airing/ilbxivd/. There's a lot of brand new Korean dating shows, check the other recent/newer threads below.\n\nMore info on Single's Inferno Season 1 expectations, other provocative shows, physical affection with the cast, et cetera: https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/zw2xum/total_lack_of_physical_affection/j1tcxkq/\n\nSome people prefer Single's Inferno Season 1 over Season 2 due to the different cast, so try watching it a bit.\n\n---\n\nIf you want legit people sleeping/interacting/etc. in the same bed in these East Asian dating shows, then there's **Sleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774)**, and **Eden, Descendants of Instinct (\uc5d0\ub374)**. Oh and there's also **Chain Reaction (\uccb4\uc778\ub9ac\uc561\uc158)** where they get chained together, lol.\n\nIn **Sleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774)** there's hilarious af scenes due to some cast members, like it's actually crazy how unexpectedly funny the show was.\n\nSleeping Only Relationship is easy to recommend as this time they actually legit sleep together in the same bed, but it's still an East Asian dating show though. It's not what you think despite the title and premise. Try to watch until Episode 2 and 3, this show is ridiculous af. You'll likely be howling with the panelists, from laughter and shock, like rofl.\n\n**For Sleeping Only Relationship they have \"unrestricted\" time from 6PM to 6AM, so that includes their dates at restaurants, etc. Usually they end up sleeping around 12/1AM, etc. and then they have to be ready by ~7/8AM.**\n\nSleeping Only Relationship doesn't have an official English sub. But it does have a fan sub right now from iheartu2 (from Youtube and Twitter), check their Twitter and Youtube pages for more info, they're also subbing Chain Reaction. There's actually machine-translated subs right now for the rest of Sleeping Only Relationship and Chain Reaction but they often skip dialogue.\n\nEden (\uc5d0\ub374) also tried to be more provocative, but again still an East Asian dating show. Season 2 (\uc5d0\ub3742) is easy to watch since it's on Viki. There's a girl there that really looks like Blackpink Jennie, it's wild.\n\nAnd Lana/\ub77c\ub098, a Russian Kpop idol is also in Eden 2.\n\n---\n\nSometimes Chinese dating shows are actually more fun than Korean/etc. dating shows. It depends on how you like the cast (and panelists).\n\nThis is already getting too long so I'll try to just list them now.\n\n**Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81)**. It's kinda like Ainori Love Wagon but in China.\n\nBtw, Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey and African Journey are available on international Netflix. And it has way older seasons (from the 2000s) that have no English subs and are only available in Japanese Netflix/sites. Ainori is a more raw, fast-paced, etc. show, it's really fun though.\n\nAnyway, basically for Twinkle Love they're university students that are having a field trip, lol. So they get missions, dates, et cetera.\n\nTwinkle Love has a lot of friendships formed in the show. Like it's one of the best shows for that, you can see them shipping each other and so on, lmao.\n\nIt's also a great show if you want to go back/forward to that freshness of young adult life ([btw, flamingos and parrots are geese] (https://www.reddit.com/r/heartsignal/comments/ns11y8/friends_share_life_terrace_house_twinkle_love/)).\n\nFor Twinkle Love, at the end of each day they have to record a message for the person they liked/spent time the most. And listen to their own message (through earbuds) IN FRONT OF EVERYONE, so it's kinda dramatic af, lol.\n\nTwinkle Love Season 1 Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxP-Ye9kr24\n\nTwinkle Love Season 2 Episode 1 Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78vUkTAhuG8\n\nSee here for other Twinkle Love links: https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/zupwjx/unreleased_the_singles_left_behind_on_inferno/j1kxp0h/\n\n---\n\n**Shanghai Sharelife (/r/Shanghaisharelife)** is the Chinese version of **Terrace House (/r/terracehouse)**, it's really good, some of us put it above Terrace House itself.\n\nLike some people's list is probably like this Shanghai Sharelife preferred over Terrace House, which is preferred over Heart Signal, and now the EXchange/Transit Love series, with possibly Pink Lie and Love Catcher in Bali in tow.\n\nPart of it is because of the panelists, they were more laidback and chill, especially for Chinese (dating) shows standards. It had some known people in it, this is the panelist list: Chen Jianbin, Li Dan, Wei Daxun, G.E.M. or Gloria Tang Sze-\u200bWing, Yang Li, Zeng Keni or Jenny Zeng.\n\nIts panelists (more context (essentially has no spoilers though) on Shanghai Sharelife panelists: https://www.reddit.com/r/Shanghaisharelife/comments/o4ljmq/unpopular_opinion/h2iu3q7/) are considered the top of these dating shows and they can/will influence how you perceive the housemates' personalities, actions, et cetera.\n\nHere's the whole playlist for Shanghai Sharelife, with/without panelists, and with also the panelists' real time reactions: https://www.reddit.com/r/Shanghaisharelife/comments/kumgil/my_thoughts_on_the_first_3_eps_of_the_show/gjw4kuo/\n\nThis is the actual start for Shanghai Sharelife, click the Amara (for English subs by ShibaSubs) links: https://www.reddit.com/r/Shanghaisharelife/comments/lyvgdg/episode_1_english_subs/\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and more info on where to watch them**: https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/zr8l5w/this_show_is_too_good/j134tmt/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zpwve5/dating_show_recs/j0v9q6u/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/znemtw/i_fell_in_love_with_korean_dating_shows/j0h5xw3/\n\n**For more comments/overview/etc. on East Asian dating shows, check these threads**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iyso9ql/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iz8ayph/\n\n---\n\n**Check these older threads (from 2021/etc.) for maybe more info on these slice of life (and dating) shows**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/n5ilf1/is_terrace_house_coming_back/gx2f6mr/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/qlmg00/are_there_any_shows_similar_to_terrace_house/hj68yh7/?context=10000\n\nThe links directly above talk a bit more about Japanese and Chinese dating shows.\n\n---\n\n**Check MyDramaList too for a more visual list of these dating shows**.

Singles inferno 2 airing just made things clear that she is still pretty iconic in the eyes of many international fans. I\u2019ve seen lot of people say \u201coh she thinks she is song jia\u201d, \u201cshe is the jia of this season\u201d, etc. With the amount of people talking about her just because of the new season, I am inclined to say she basically became the face of the show.",

For money catcher to win the money, they have to be paired up with a love catcher.\n\n&gt;!Chanwoo was a money catcher. And just like most dating shows, there is a love triangle and he was part of it. Apparently, the girl was going more into the other guy from that love triangle, so he has to grab his chances to win that money. There was a challenge that the PD did, and it was a cooking show, I guess? Gabin (the girl) cooked a seafood dish, and Chanwoo perfectly knew that he was *allergic* to it, and he still proceeded to eat the dish she made. Of course, he got sick and Gabin gave him attention to take care of him.!&lt; Pretty insane.\n\nHis smirk at the end was chef's kiss. It's definitely one of the best scenes in dating shows. He's one of the most hated dating show contestants because he's way too good at fooling everyone.",

Like yes it's altered/etc. but fam, it don't matter.\n\nThese two scenes with Dana were legendary af: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C6EfaEmh34, for the noona romance life; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2iyBxJl5PA, for the photoshoot romance life\n\nSigh, I hope Heart Signal 4 has Dana or somebody similar to her visuals/personality/etc. She was so chill. If you watch the post-show vlogs by some of the Love Catcher in Seoul, Dana seems laidback there too. Damn, for sure she'd be legendary if she was in Heart Signal 4 or maybe like EXchange/Transit Love. Something with better filming time or renown.\n\n---\n\nFor **Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac)**, there's probably like 2 or so people that will be considered legendary by the decisions scene at the end of the season.\n\nOne of them is probably Hyojin, this is her introduction scene by TVING from the pre-release of Episode 1, no spoilers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVBQJ6H5Ao0&amp;t=360s\n\nLove Catcher in Bali is already legendary to me because of the visuals, but ya it depends on how the ending will go for most people as Season 2 is considered the best.\n\nLove Catcher Season 2 was subbed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/dcbekl/love_catcher_season_2_e01_190822/. Links are gone now, but check the threads below. Well you have to find it on the usual streaming sites as it's actually fansubbed.\n\n---\n\nFor Chinese dating shows, there's **Ming from Shanghai Sharelife (the Chinese version of Terrace House)**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY2x4Y8W8lU&amp;t=62s\n\nMing entered Shanghai Sharelife by vlogging with her phone, like who else has done that. I don't remember now, there must be one from other Korean/Chinese/Japanese/etc. dating shows, but not as iconic as Ming.\n\nHer storyline in Shanghai Sharelife was a bit underwhelming but the ending was insane, like wtf, lmao. Not gonna spoil it, just gonna say it's not what you think at all, literally so random.\n\nMing has everything: solid career in finance, great personality, nice face visuals, insane body visuals, stylish af fashion, et cetera. Like they lucked out so much with her, wish there was somebody comparable.\n\nShanghai Sharelife on the other hand is available on Youtube through the YOUKU channel (they also have their own website).\n\nIts panelists (more context (essentially has no spoilers though) on Shanghai Sharelife panelists: https://www.reddit.com/r/Shanghaisharelife/comments/o4ljmq/unpopular_opinion/h2iu3q7/) are considered the top of these dating shows and they can/will influence how you perceive the housemates' personalities, actions, et cetera.\n\nHere's the whole playlist for Shanghai Sharelife, with/without panelists, and with also the panelists' real time reactions: https://www.reddit.com/r/Shanghaisharelife/comments/kumgil/my_thoughts_on_the_first_3_eps_of_the_show/gjw4kuo/\n\nThis is the actual start for Shanghai Sharelife, click the Amara (for English subs by ShibaSubs) links: https://www.reddit.com/r/Shanghaisharelife/comments/lyvgdg/episode_1_english_subs/\n\n---\n\nFor the original season of Terrace House (Boys x Girls Next Door), there's a lot of them. That's where trendy **Seina** from Opening New Doors is actually from.\n\nAnyway, there's some unbeatable storylines from Boys x Girls Next Door that haven't been topped yet because of how short a lot of dating shows are. Like for Terrace House the members can stay for several months, meanwhile for these other dating shows, they're often only there for like 4-10 days or 1 week or so.\n\nThis is kinda how to watch Terrace House: Boys x Girls Next Door: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zfkwnq/how_do_i_watch_boys_girls_next_door/izchnov/\n\nOh and for Terrace House: Aloha State there's this legendary samurai named Taishi, this is him having a short catch up lunch with Avian, another one of the Aloha State residents: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4GScZvur1c. Taishi's intro credits scene is him practicing with his sword and that's all you need to know, lmao. \n\nSigh, to this day I'm still wondering if I'd lived in Hawaii or California and so on, would I be in Aloha State. I still consumed a ton of Japanese light novels, manga, anime, Jdoramas, Japanese variety shows, et cetera back then. Man, there are so many different timelines.\n\n---\n\nWow, this already got way too long again.\n\nOkay, back to Korean dating shows.\n\nYa **Kim Minkyu/Mingue and Chae Jian from Love Me Actually** (2019, it's like a travel club and they play games to compete for love) were great. This is Jian's introduction to the traveling club: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvFnURz6Aow\n\n**For I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO (/r/IamSolo), Season 7 has this legendary girl named Ok Soon**, so people have expectations with her name now.\n\nSeason 7 starts at Episode 39, ends with Episode 44. Each season is say 6-8 episodes and they can be watched standalone, no need to watch the previous seasons.\n\nIn **Sleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774)** there's hilarious af scenes due to some cast members, like it's actually crazy how unexpectedly funny the show was.\n\nSleeping Only Relationship is easy to recommend as this time they actually legit sleep together in the same bed, but it's still an East Asian dating show though. It's not what you think despite the title and premise. Try to watch until Episode 2 and 3, this show is ridiculous af. You'll likely be howling with the panelists, from laughter and shock, like rofl.\n\n**For Sleeping Only Relationship they have \"unrestricted\" time from 6PM to 6AM, so that includes their dates at restaurants, etc. Usually they end up sleeping around 12/1AM, etc. and then they have to be ready by ~7/8AM.**\n\nSleeping Only Relationship doesn't have an official English sub. But it does have a fan sub right now from iheartu2 (from Youtube and Twitter), check their Twitter and Youtube pages for more info, they're also subbing Chain Reaction. There's actually machine-translated subs right now for the rest of Sleeping Only Relationship and Chain Reaction but they often skip dialogue.\n\n---\n\nSome more info from your previous thread of other infamous and beloved dating show members: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/xolisw/who_are_the_most_beloved_and_hated_dating_show/iq0008f/\n\nAnyway, his is too long, below are the usual thread links for more info, if you keep clicking through the ones where it says \"click here for more\" or every thread link, then you'll see comments/etc. on the other Korea/Chinese/Japanese/etc. dating shows.\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and more info on where to watch them**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zqf0dp/singles_inferno_2_ep_3_4_20221220/j147u12/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/ &lt;--- check this link for where to watch other dating shows.",

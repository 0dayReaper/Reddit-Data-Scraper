Although it was nice to see them opening up the other business and buying stuff from other vendors in town/at the wholesale market. \n\nI don\u2019t know if they can go back to season 1 vibes though. IMO the whole draw of this show is them learning something new and share that experience with locals. I don\u2019t know, maybe there is some other type of business they can run?\n\nOn a tangential note, there is a british TV show very similar to unexpected business that I highly recommend watching. Its called Clarkson\u2019s Farm and it follows a famous tv presenter as he learns how to work on a farm that he bought for his retirement. Its not as cozy because there is some issues with karens not liking what his farm is doing, but the wonderful thing about the show is not only is it entertaining but it really highlights the struggles that farms go through to proving our countries with food. Its really a thankless job.",

Like the cancelling happen around the same time as when Season 2 of Clarkson\u2019s farm came out so Amazon could of pulled the plug on Season 3 but they are still going to film and publish season 3 and 4 more grand tour episodes purely because they have already ordered them. \n\nSo basically, by the time those shows air the storm will have passed and Amazon will probably forget that they cancelled him.",

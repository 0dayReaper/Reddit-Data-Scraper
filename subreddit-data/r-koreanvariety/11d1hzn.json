    "postText": "a while ago i watched this clip of a korean variety show where they were doing a try not to laugh challenge during a meal. at one point a director came out in a tight pikachu crop top, at another a cast member took off their sunglasses and had their eyes painted black.... i thought it was running man because it was a similar format to what i've seen before (and i think it was in a compilation video with jongkook and the long nose-haired girl) but i've searched again and again and i can't find it. i was hoping someone could help me identify the show/episode! thank you!",

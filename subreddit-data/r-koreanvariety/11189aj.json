A lot of insightful stuff was mentioned and some that I already put in practice though I'm far from being rich. The &gt;!multiple bank accounts and the exercising every day are good practices. Having a thorough schedule for the day planned out is another one but like Eun Jiwon said it's easier said than!&lt; done.\n\nHis thoughts on &gt;!work-life balance is something I can never agree with though so I guess I'll never be rich lol. Also, as commendable as it is to teach your child about money at an early age, I'm not too keen on the idea of putting a price on  every good deed done.!&lt;\n\nI forgot the third thing he mentioned to &gt;!let go of. Does anyone remember? I only remember the concept of money and unplanned schedules. Edited to say I remember it now: Cinderella syndrome.!&lt;",

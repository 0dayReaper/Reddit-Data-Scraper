The moment they run out of time, they are checked out.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Chloe (Idol, Member of 'cignature')\n* Hong Jinho (Former Pro Gamer, Poker Player, Winner of 'The Genius')\n* Hwang Jeseong (Comedian)\n* John Park (Singer, Dreamboat)\n* Joo Eonkyu (YouTuber, Creator of 'Sinsaimdang')\n* Kim Hyunkyu (Actor)\n* Kim Namhee (Announcer)\n* Layone (Rapper)\n* Monika (Dancer, Leader of 'PROWDMON')\n* Shin Jiyeon (Student, Cast Member from 'Single's Inferno')\n\n# Notes\n\nAs some of you might know, the episodes were delayed by a couple weeks to due a plagiarism controversy involving the contestant Joo Eonkyu. There were fears of the producers having to significantly re-edit the episodes, which typically doesn't end well. At least for E1 and E2 we have access to the original edit and can confirm that the changes made were minimal. I will post a summary of the scenes cut/added from the episodes in the comments here.",

            "comment": "Spoiler Ep 1-4\n\n&gt;!Really enjoyable so far, the Kairos game is similar to The Genius with some variations. The Check-out matches so far are both interesting too. The concept of the time is similar to Garnets in The Genius but more flexibility. Suite room advantages are also great addition to the game.!&lt;\n\nAbout the cast\n\n&gt;!Hong Jinho: Seems like he is still a bit rusty after all these hiatus breaks. He seems to easily lose focus than usual (almost cost him in Ep.4). Need to pick some game up because the remaining ones aren\u2019t easy casts for him to cruise by.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Hwang Jesong: Always love comedian in the show because their flexibility and adaptation. May not be great as Jang Dong Min but showing some great positives so far and make a huge contribution to the alliance. A real glue of the alliance!!! Still very hard to see him win it all here as the game will become more individual later. Still expecting a Top 4.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!John Park: A real contender for me right now. Easily understanding the game and quick thinking. If he doesn\u2019t mess up almost 1 minute in putting the pin, he would have won Ep.3. He is the one to watch out for when it\u2019s come to individual game. He knows to be loyal to the alliance but also see a glimpse of distance to Jinho-Jeseong as he shows when talking to Hankyu.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Eun Kyu: A real troublemaker!!! Yes, I dislike his persona but still glad he shakes up the scene in Ep.4 which gives him the advantage in number and almost win against The Alliance. Still hope to see him gone soon as I find him very annoying. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Hankyu: Thought he will be a goner this episode but still pull through the crisis. Great job for winning the game in Ep.3-4. I can see him as a dark horse against John Park.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Chloe: Her checkout game against Layone shows that she has some mental strength and she always find herself in some good positions during the game (except Ep.3). Seems like both teams still want to work with her. She has a really long shot but may pull a surprise and make it deep.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Shin Jiyeon: NOOOOOO!!! She was my dark horse pick since Ep.1 and everything is going perfectly for her until that 1 paper card. (Although it saves Jinho). Sigh\u2026if she just calm down and recheck it first. What a shame because I still want to see more from her.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Layone: Poor guy, he seems to have a trouble getting some footing in the game since Day 1. And seems like his mind checks out after losing Gold pin game. Find his relationship with Chloe very cute and heartwarming too.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Kim Namhee: Also a little bit sad to see her go too early. She has a very great ambition to the game but too much aggression makes her a big target and it costs her game. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Monika: Seems like a miscast, she doesn\u2019t seem to get the game at all. Doesn\u2019t show any single play at all during her short stay. Nothing to comment much here.!&lt;\n\nEpisode 5 preview:\n\n&gt;!Anyway, for the revival match: Hoping Namhee or Jiyeon wins and gets back to the game. (Layone is fine too.)!&lt;",

                    "comment": "i honestly think Layonee was keeping Chloe close because he didn't want her ousting him to EK.\n\nChloe is not smart. The board game is kids play. Her advantage has been that she is lucky - had she not played the practice game, she'd be struggling too.. EK saved her.. both in the game from practice and defending her standpoint\n\nJinho is definitely not in  his element. I think he is also taking it super easy. Layonne is a disappointment given how quickly he loses entire focus\n\n\nI think John Park and Jiyeon are the only personalities that don't bug me. Namhee would have been great too. but for now, will put my money on JP too. I don't think JY brings a lot of astute gameplay/ strategy.. she i smore of process person.. if she knows a strategy, she can execute it well\n\n\nChloe i dislike vehemently of all contestants.. she just irks me and her getting all this free rides to safety\n\n**************************\ni also can't shake the feeling if production houses make a pact to retain hong jinho to a certain episodes.. ep 4 exit was just so unbelievable",

Chloe has no problem whatsoever in understanding and playing any main event meanwhile people like HyunKyu, Layone, JaeSung, Earn Gyu consistently struggled with and yet to call them out. &gt;!Chloe was also dominating during practice in Death Match and performed way superior than all 3 others. The other 3 were the one that can't even manage what you called \"kids game\" and making simple mistakes everywhere. This game is far from easy btw.!&lt;\n\nAlso what do you mean taking free rides? This is fucking survival game and it's all about people find ways to survive. And you think \"free riding\" is easy? So far and in history of other reality game people fuck up a lot even when \"free riding\"\n\nYou point of show being rigged is too stupid that I don't even want to comment at all",

She was able to dominate because of that and also due to the fact EK basically covered her and defended whatever needed to be defended while i felt Jinho played pretty poorly and failed to spot the danger several times.",

EK was definitely the mastermind to their team but HJ cannot do a single thing when his team mate has nothing between his ears\n\nchloe is mid. she's not a complete dud like monika or layonee who are completely dead weight, but she got through episode 2 by spying for the strong alliance and sabotaging the weak alliance - an absolutely horrendous long term strategy that only conceptually exists for people who know they have no chance of winning - why on earth would you help the strong alliance become a cornerstone instead of trying to chip them off early so they can't just systematically eliminate the weak team one by one until it's only them left\n\nep 1 all you had to do was not be dogshit to get through\n\nep 3 she got extremely lucky that she got carried by someone who KNEW he betrayed her. EK could've just assisted layonee since he didn't know about the triple betrayal in ep2. he instead kept her around because he recognised she was a slightly stronger player and probably thought that she was less likely to betray him if she was indebted to him\n\nep4 she is just there. EK saves her completely by turning the tables from being completely rigged against them to being completely rigged in favour of them. she then contributes nothing of significance and survives by copying someone else's answer\n\nmeanwhile she says stuff like \"wow I can't believe I was betrayed\" in episode 3, when she has literally done nothing but betray her own team for a free ride at every opportunity. I haven't seen e5 yet but I will not be surprised if she does the exact same thing and just teams up with the top 3 for protection, and jinho recognises it. that's why they called her up. ek is clearly not going to ally with them and the other guy is not reliable and a leaker. they have her marked as a good little pawn who will help them kill off her own team and then kill off her the episode after that, her only goal is to get the top ranking she can get by being allowed to win by better players as a strategy to eliminate better players than her and then kick her out of the alliance the second she stops being useful\n\nshe is actually more actively harmful than the duds, at least duds will try their best and share their information which might help the people on their side, she will actively just destroy her own team for a chance to come.. 6th place or some mediocre inconsequential placing. useless",

For example in Episode 1(this is the only one i watched so far) The jinho strat was a really good moment, and the John Park paper streak adds some context to the game. I may understand why they cut some of Eongyu's parts because of the controversy but I confused why they have to edit gameplay footage that doesn't include him.",

John basically solved the first 4, then they used a round to figure out the last 3, and on the 6th round the chances are high that they have the full slot. If that's the case you would normally come to the dealer when the result is about to be announced to confirm your result. Besides during the first rounds we can see him and everyone else racing to submit their boards so he definitely knew the urgency of being able to submit fast. It may just be the editing but jinho seems to be still trying to calculate stuff and maybe didnt realize the results were being announced already, or he just didn't have a full grasp of the situation like he normally does.",

            "comment": "So I finally finished watching 1-4 and here are my thoughts\n\nThe Game - pretty much a reskinned version of The Genius. The format consists of a main match then a deathmatch to see who's eliminated. Garnets became Time, Deathmatch became check out match, and the masked man became a bunny. This isn't bad though, in fact I like it. The Genius pretty much paved the way for this genre so it's just natural that similar shows will have similarity just like how other shows of the same gennre are similar. They also added some twists of their own like giving the currency more use, the players staying in the venue until they get kicked out. The games are pretty fun and interesting too. The only thing I don't like for now is that the games seems to be too focused on teams which breeds backstabbing and power bullying and I think this was the weakest aspect for the genius as well. Although it's still just 4 episodes in so I'm hoping they have a good spread of individual games as well. I just hope they don't pull a survivor style game/finale/checkout match where other players can directly influence the outcome of a 1v1 match. Personally I hate that part of The Genius\n\nThe Cast - pretty much the production did a good job casting, most of them have proven they have the skills and drive to win the game except maybe for Monika. Jin Ho was my favorite coming in but based on what we've seen so far Eunkyu seems to be a really good dark horse, he has emotional problems and his personality looks really bad, he takes things too personally and very emotional. lol during the happy hour he seems to be so grumpy at the table while everyone else is having so much fun. However he does have some really good attention to detail, he was the only one who noticed about the board games being related to the checkout matches, and he was the one who noticed that the vending machine had no water leading them to discover about the hoarding that caught jinho red handed. He even remembers little things like the sizes of the bottled water which lead to him discover hyunkyu was a two timer, and he also masterfully jebaited jin ho dealing emotional damage which almost eliminated him. Then there's the checkout match against nam hee where he was able to count her rabbits by watching her hand movement and accurately guessing she played a gold just by her reaction. And he also carried Chloe on another checkout match. Right now, he is my top pick for winning if this continues. \n\nThe girls was also a pleasant surprise, at first I thought they were just a pretty face but seems like everyone can pull their weight. Nam hee was my favorite and she really was good. She's good at computations and planning but unfortunately it seems she's bad at psychological games.\n\nOverall I think everyone remaining has the capability to win this so I'm hoping for more good games and a season 2.",

If Eon Kyu did not exist, then the Jinho alliance will just pick off Jiyeon, Chloe, and Kyunhun one by one. Chloe and Kyunhun were more than happy to cooperate with the alliance because they only seem to care about serving to the next day. Eon Kyu even said that he already tried to lead with charisma but lost to Jinho and Jeseong. So his only option is to lead with fear and intimidation instead (which worked well).",

The games are kinda recycled from various games, but its working and barely have loopholes. For the talent department, it's kinda okay (this also makes me realise how tight The Genius casting is).!&lt; The show shows much potential, and I think it's worth watching till the end!",

But there're some problems after watched the first two. This is WAY too similar to The Genius. It has been 8 years since The Genius last broadcasted. I would really expect a lot of innovative ideas. Instead it is almost identical in every way just with beautiful filming sets and reformed games.\n\nThe games are again too team and betrayal focused. In the past, The Genius in later seasons was criticized of the lacking of individual game like the legendary Open Pass for players to shine. Lastly, the casting is not stellar. Despite they try to cast artists that are highly educated, most players yet look clueless about the games. So far, it's hard for me to see any of them capable of making big brain huge outplays like Jang Dong Min or Hong Jin Ho. We will see though. It's still a great show overall",

The casts are good too (though I think  the dynamics of TG is better). \n\nBut, but\u2014 what makes The Genius iconic was not just the games and the cast but most especially the EDITING! The intro, the bgm, the narrative style, JJY shows' iconic flashbacks and fast forwards lol\n\nThe Genius was so good at making the story better (well, there's literally The Great Escape), hiding informations, highlighting, right timing, etc which THE TIME HOTEL won't be able to replicate. \n\nA great show indeed (so far) but won't make it to my top 3 of favorite mystery/psychological variety shows for sure.",

I think most of the casts so far are pretty decent in understanding the game and learning the rule quickly (there are some exceptions of course). I feel like some may set a bar too high wanting to see new Dong Min, new Jinho or new Hyunmin. Maybe if the show got some buzz and has Season 2/3, we can see more great new players but from a standpoint of brand new variety show, this is good.\n\nRemember that in Season 1, only Jinho can be passed as a great player with some decent ones like Sunggyu (in gameplay potential) and Kyungran, Samgmin (of course not in strategy but very strong social) then we have duds like Gura and more. So compared with this cast, I think the overall quality of players is about the same.",

I feel like I'm having an aneurysm. likewise, there are 3 other great contestants who are very high quality. and the girl who accidentally got eliminated in RPS went out sadly soon, she impressed me and I think she could've gone far. even the girl in the first game who got eliminated in day 1 could've gone further two. there are only three really weak cast members, chloe, monica and the boy band boy who was chloe's friend. the guy who keeps playing both sides, forgot his name again but the vip end of day 4, is a bit mid, but the rest are all killers. in the entire run of the genius there were only by my count 8 top tier players, that's 2 per season\n\nI also love that it's longform instead of doing a genius and trying to cram it all into an hour, I LIKE the lax editing where we get to see way more of every aspect, from the social to the game to the death games\n\nI couldn't be happier with this format",

So I think politicking/socializing/scheming is still needed even in open pass if you don't want to get picked for a deathmatch, its just so happen that they got the best scenario on this one imo.\n\nHave no objections on 5:5 tho :D\n\nEdit: on second thoughts wouldn't 5:5 a team game as well if by team game it needed collaboration to win?

Especially considering there is still an element of strategy around it with eating or saving or both eating and making some time back like Kim Nam-Hee did.\n\nTeam attack-defend rock-paper-scissors game feels super complicated and random for first episode. It also feels like Je-Seong won a lot by seemingly doing nothing but i guess it was his tactic.\n\nKim Nam-Hee is again the big spender -- always the first one to check out all opportunities and spend time. I really like her play. I think Chloe and Leone are way too passive and easily swayed, but agreeing to partnerships is still better than just standing by himself for 11 turns like John Park did.\n\nEp 2\n\nlol at Jinho saying \"i am accustomed to stand near #1\"\n\nStarting from this episode games also start adding more physical component making tables far apart so several rounds were decided y people not being able to reach them in time.\n\nEp 3\n\nI really like how show keeps pacing it's various gimmicks.\n\nEp 4\n\nSurvival part of the show with buying stuff and high-roller becoming VIPs evolves further as prices go up (with advance notice to VIP so he can stock up).  Player splurging in the bar changes possible alliances because he can then becomes a candidate for VIP suit.\n\nUnfortunately, pre-game negotiations were kinda cringe -- Eon-Kyu clumsily lying and trying to sink Hyun-Kyu got old real quick.\n\nOn the game itself -- i think the team who got all 1 and 2 guesses, really should have had randomly tossed around all their cards, since they really can't go lower than 1 changing the entire combination increases their chances for guesses more than changing cards one by one.\n\nAlso 4th eliminee leaving as they're announcing Happy hour party was brutal.\n\nOverall, based on first four episodes -- this show really excels on pacing meta-game twists constantly making new additions to the general structure of challenges but games themselves are kinda too messy. But i really like the atmosphere and the gimmick, it kinda feels like polished and less ugly Money Game (gonzo survival game on youtube).\n\nAlso the montage of roof game falling apart with John Park singing the song was fantastic.\n\nI really hope &gt;!Kim Nam-Hee!&lt; comes back, she was my favourite member with her proactive enthusiastic play.",

                    "comment": "In the ep4 rock paper scissors game I really couldn\u2019t believe that neither team was able to do it in less than 6 rounds. You could do it by yourself in 7 rounds by just switching one guess per round. \n\nThe team that had 4 people had it so easy all they had to do is start with a baseline like RRSSPPP (this is the strategists cards). Then the other 3 players switch one position. So your first round guesses would be:\nRRS SPPP\nSRS SPPP\nRSS SPPP\nRRR SPPP\n\nWith this setup you are guaranteed to know the first 3 positions because if player2 has a higher score than baseline you know that the first position is a scissors, if his score is the same as baseline you know that the first position is Paper, and if player2\u2019s score goes below baseline you know the first position is Rock.\n\nOkay so now that we know the first 3 positions after one round everyone flips their first 3 cards back to baseline, and now we simply change one card from the last 4 positions for each player. The cards will look like this:\nRRS RPPP\nRRS SRPP\nRRS SPRP\nRRS SPPR\n\nIf a player goes up from the score baseline got in the first round the card they changed was the correct answer. If they have the same score as the previous rounds baseline that means the card that hasn\u2019t been played yet is the answer, and if their score goes down that means the card the baseline used in that position was right.\n\nEZPZ round 3, everyone turns in the correct answer and the other team doesn\u2019t even see it coming because they didn\u2019t switch out the correct answers.\n\n\n\nThats not all, the bonus items make it possible for the 3 person team to win by round 3 as well. All they have to do is buy 2 bonus items round 1 and use it on the same position:\n\nR SS RRPP (baseline)\nStie RS RRPP\nPtie SR RRPP\n\nWhichever person get the tie in the first round you know that opposite is the answer. So if Player2 gets the tie, You know that the rock won. So then you just need to add +1 to the score of players 2 and 3 to be able to calculate which cards won in positions 2 and 3. If Player3 gets the tie, you need to -1 from Player 2. If no one ties the Rock from the baseline is the correct answer. From there you use the win totals to determine which cards win in positions 2 and 3, giving your team 3 known card positions after round 1.\n\nNow that they have the first 3 cards known, all they have to do is change one card from the last 3 positions for each player and buy 2 more tie items. You literally just mirror what you did the first round but with the other half of the board and because the baseline is know you can find out 4 positions this round since the baseline player can change one card away from baseline like everyone else did in round 1, so it would look like this:\n\nRSS SRP Ptie\nRSS RSP Rtie\nRSS RRS P\n\nFirst and Third player changed one card from baseline. So if the second player ties, they just need to add +1 to player 2\u2019s score (since player 1 and 2\u2019s paper is the winning answer. If player one ties or no one ties then you don\u2019t have to adjust any players score to calculate which positions won, and you now understand what position 7\u2019s answer is. If paper tied you just pick scissors, if no one tied you pick rock. \n\nI think the 3 person strategy is definitely harder to think up in the moment, but its a big blunder that they didn\u2019t just immediately buy all 3 bonus cards in the first round, even if you don\u2019t have a strategy the bonus cards gives you a chance to get lucky and figure out at least one of the positions by getting a tie. I would have honestly expect them to simply do the first strategy but with one less player. Meaning that even if their bonus cards don\u2019t find a tie they could still reliably figure out 2 card positions in the first round, 3 positions in the second round and the last 2 in the third round. Meaning that the 3 person team should have been able to at least end the game by the 4th round, but if they got lucky and managed to find two ties in the first round they could have ended it in 3 rounds.",

            "comment": "Finally got time to watch 4 episodes of the show. I liked everything except editing and lack of BGM. I thought Blood Game was really awful in terms of editing, but it had at least some tension and elements of surprise with great music from Idiotape. With The Time Hotel sometimes I have a feeling that I am watching documentary. I hope with next season, if they will have one, they will get more experienced with production. \n\nSo far I liked the half of the cast. Knew only Jinho and John Park from \"brainy\" shows and Jaesung as comedian. I am surprised with Jaesung almost as much as I was surprised with Dongmin in TG. Jinho is my number 1 choice wherever he participates. I just like his overall personality, his stuttering speech (it's surprise that nobody made fun on it yet lol) and his brain. Part of me wants Jinho to win, but part of me thinks that it will be too predictable, but I really hope that he will not be placed second lol, it is better to be eliminated earlier. \n\nEonkyu is really a surprise discovery. I had no idea who he was before, never seen his shows or varieties he participated at. He is great at understanding the games with small info he has and he got the importance of allies pretty early. However I think he lacks charisma of the natural leader, everything he does to dominate other people looks a bit pathetic. \n\nThe rest of the team with exception may be of Namhee, lack presence and they seem to be not on par with people I mentioned above. I think it might be due to poor editing and not proportional screen time, I hope they will get their momentum to shine individually in upcoming episodes. \n\nAnyway this show is something I am looking forward to. It is absolutely not on the same level as TG, but at least something that can make people excited with the games and with more refined concept and editing it might have potential to be the next TG.",

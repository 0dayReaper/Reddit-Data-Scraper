She wasen't doing any form of personal flirting or courting towards him. I felt she took the guys for granted. I also agreed with Egeon that he seemed more relaxed with Seoyeon than with Lana, where he was stiff and on his toes. I felt Lana should have been more genereous and courteous. I wouldn't want to date Lana judging by her coldness. Don't get why Egeon or Seoyeon would be blamed when Egeon and Lana have zero chemistry- they look good together but look isn't all. \n\nI was pleasently surprised to see Seoyeon and Egeon have a nice, relaxed date. I want to see them more together. I also felt bad for Soomin, Lana is right to be direct about her disintrest but Soomin is such a silly heartsick goose. He is my favorite in the show.",

I'd say maybe he should have given Lana a little heads up. Of course that's easier said than done but yeah. Still, I think we got here eight decent guys and gals and this is a great learning and growing opportunity for everybody.

Sad and disappointed that we see more and more cases like these where people gather en masse like those witch-hunting mobs to cancel and force people they don't like (again for no good reason) into hiding. It sucks that the only real advice she will get is to lay low and wait until they change their targets, though even then the residual effect will still linger.",

How does it differentiate you from angry, criminal gangsters? The show Terrace House had to be canceled because fans drove a contestant to suicide. At Singles Inferno, Jia was canceled and nearly depressed for superficial, unnecessary hate. And the worst thing of all is that hate from women goes to other women. Men stick together, but women all stab each other in the back with envy. How can that be? No wonder men are in power when women put down other women in the spotlight instead of supporting them. SeoYeon is also a bold, independent, modern woman who takes what she wants. When men do this, they get praise. When women do that, they get put down. Do you women all want to be oppressed further? Because that's what happens when you act like this instead of supporting brave women who are breaking new ground. Arent you ashamed?",

There's a reason Kpop fans are known to be the most vicious and vile out of there. People have to walk on eggshells around those Kpop stars out of fear of their fans. They worship them to the point where nothing is a flaw. There was this guy who was arrested and jailed and fined in China (he's a Kpop artist and also a Canadian citizen, but did all of his nasty business in China) and sentenced to jail for 13 years for rape charges, orgies where they drugged under aged girls who were fans of his, and apparently financial crimes. There were still people on Twitter defending them and saying those girls probably wanted that to happen and that this person didn't need to rape anyone because he was so hot !!! The stupidity is staggering. \n\nHeck, it's not even Kpop and dating reality shows. Running Man has one of the most toxic fandoms out there. Just go on their official instagram and read the comments on the older episodes when SoMin and SeChan first joined. You'll wanna barf from all the poison in those comments. Then they also brought that to JSM's personal instagram account and even her brother's. They even sent death threats to her and her family before a Vietnam fanmeeting. It got so bad, tiny (Jongkook's best friend) took it to Twitter to bash those losers. They had a Facebook groups of over 100,000 followers organizing hate crimes like mass reporting her account, disliking her YouTube videos especially her speech when accepting the variety awards, and plans to hold banners of \"JSM out\" or \"7012 forever\" at the fanmeeting in Vietnam. They even threatened to harm her if she showed up to the fanmeeting. There are videos at the airport of the whole cast surrounding SoMin to protect her. Still mad how running man didn't cancel that fanmeeting and put her in so much danger. \n\nBtw, most of those who did this and still to this day do this are song JiHyo fans. The only other woman on running man. SJH has stayed silent and never addressed this. It's funny, some of them are Gary fans too but YSC never got the same amount of hate JSM recieved. It really shows how this comes from a place of misogyny. \n\nPeople just can't handle when a woman is confident, funny, energetic, not afraid to make fun of herself, says whatever, does whatever and is open and vulnerable.",

I'm a total Lana fan, big reason why I'm watching the show in the first place, and I don't think either Seoyeon or Egeon have done anything wrong... well, Egeon breaking his promise to Lana is not cool, but to be fair to him he'd made a previous promise that he wanted to honor, so, he'd made a mess and he was trying to deal with it. But yeah nobody is married to anybody here, and the point of the show is to date and get to know people. Egeon and Seoyeon just did what everybody else should be doing. Stop promising each other things, this is not the environment for that, that's just immaturity and insecurity. Now that's not to say we can't expect feelings to develop, egos will get hurt, perhaps even sincere hearts will get hurt. But yeah you can't act based on what somebody else wants. That just creates its own problems. People who are angry at Egeon and Seoyeon for trying to find a way out of uncomfortable situations are ridiculous themselves.",

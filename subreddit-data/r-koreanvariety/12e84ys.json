But I guess if the same actors guest multiple times then they would probably run out of stories to tell and the \u2018guess the answer\u2019 segment wouldn\u2019t be that entertaining. I mean how many interesting events can one person have in their life time? \ud83d\ude05",

I thought it was only a temporary thing but they've been doing for so long now... it's sad for me because KB to me kinda meant the classroom setting. About the rating, it think it's pretty stable from 2-3.",

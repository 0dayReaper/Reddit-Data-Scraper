on target which **(GT 1 -GK-)** smothers easily!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~1' GT Foul: **(WC 27)** takes a sideline kick-in with a pass to **(WC 452)**, **(GT 18)** gets under **(WC 452)** during the jumping battle for the ball and gets called for a foul, free kick is awarded near the right wing mid way between the goal line and centerline!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~1' WC Miss: **(WC 27)** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot on target (no goal if it went in), **(GT 1 -GK-)** re-directs the ball out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~1' WC Miss: **(WC 456)** takes a quick corner kick-in with a shot towards the goal mouth that **(GT 7)** blocks, the ball goes back to **(WC 456)** and she shoots it on target but **(GT 7)** blocks it again and it goes out of bounds to the right wing sideline!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~1' WC Miss: **(WC 27)** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot towards the goal mouth area and **(GT 7)** kicks the ball forward that **(GT 100)** kicks forward but **(WC 23)** gets a shot on net that **(GT 7)** blocks again, the ball goes out of bounds to the sidelines!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' WC Miss: **(WC 452)** passes to **(WC 456)** and receives the ball back for a give-and-go but **(WC 452)** lays another pass forward that is just a bit too strong for **(WC 456)**, a nice play of give-and-go x2, **(GT 7)** kicks it out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' WC Miss: **(WC 452)** takes a corner kick-in  with a shot at the goal mouth area that **(GT 7)** deflects, the redirected ball goes to the lower right side of the GT net and **(GT 1 -GK-)** swats out of bounds for another corner kick, great reaction, GT cannot get any offense going!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' GT Miss: **(GT 100)** takes a quick sideline kick-in before WC can gather their wits for defense with a quick cross pass to the opposite side to a wide open **(GT 66)** who manages a weak one-time shot on net that **(WC 27)** kicks out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' WC Miss: **(WC 452)** passes the ball back to **(WC 23)**, who then passes forward to **(WC 456)** at the top of the 16 yard box and takes a shot on target that **(GT 1 -GK-)** smothers!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~4' GT Miss: **(GT 1 -GK-)** takes a goal kick with a high lobbing ball that bounces in front of the WC net and looks threatening, **WC 01 -GK-)** manages to keep her focus and catches the ball before entering the net, **(GT 100)** was there to capitalize on a mistake!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~4' WC Miss: **(WC 119)** passes the ball forward with pace that **(WC 456)** misses but **(WC 452)** chasing the ball down at the top of the 16 yard box but cannot get a shot off before **(GT 1 -GK-)** runs to intercept the ball with a kick out of bounds to the sidelines!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~5' WC Miss: **(GT 7)** makes a mistake and passes the ball to **(WC 452)** on the right wing, with space **(WC 452)** takes a power shot on target aimed for the top right corner that **(GT 1 -GK-)** gets a hand on and the ball drops in front of the goal mouth area for her to smother, great shot and save!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' WC Miss: **(GT 100)** takes a corner kick-in with **(GT 1 -GK-)** cheating a bit to assist in the offense, the pass is terrible and **(WC 452)** steals it and dribbles down the left wing with speed with **(GT 1 -GK-)** and **(GT 18)** sprinting back to defend, **(WC 452)** takes a power shot on target (from last week's previews) that **(GT 1 -GK-)** manages to get her right hand on but not fully, so the ball that was shot hard continues towards the net but **(GT 1 -GK-)** got enough of the ball that it hits the cross bar and goes back into play but the play ends with **(GT 100)** kicking the ball out of bounds to the sidelines!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' GT Foul: **(WC 456)** takes a corner kick-in with a shot towards the goal mouth that **(WC 452)** manages to re-direct and **(GT 7)** got her outstretched left hand to contact the ball, **Coach EulYong** yells for a hand ball foul with his crazy intensity and the whistle is blown, VAR is used and the result is a penalty kick, looks like **(WC 452)** will be shooting and **(GT 1 -GK-)** the goalie!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!6' WC GOAL: **(WC 452)** takes a penalty shot with a power shot aimed for the bottom left corner, **(GT 1 -GK-)** has no chance to save with a perfectly shot ball with power and accuracy, **(GT 1 -GK-)** should have used her legs rather than stretch out her upper body to reach for the shot,  WC get **Coach EulYong** into the goal ceremony by having him hit the top of their heads as they drop to the floor after getting hit, LOL!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' GT Miss: **(GT 18)** takes the centerline kick-in with a shot on target that is slightly grazed by the WC defensive wall, **(WC 01 -GK-)** smothers the ball easily!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' WC Miss: **(GT 66)** gets the ball stolen from her by **(WC 456)** who sticks her foot out and re-directs the ball to **(WC 452)**, **(WC 452)** passes right back to **(WC 456)** and gets a weak shot on net that is off target by a foot to the bottom left corner, **(GT 1 -GK-)** dives for the ball but knowing it's not on target lets it roll out of bounds!&lt;\n\nHALFTIME SCORE LINE: &gt;!------- Giants 0 - 1 WorldClass----, GT cannot manage to generate any offense, having KyungHee in net hurts their offense a lot, WC pressing hard and making great passes, looks like Jin JeongSun will play goalie in the second half, an interesting risky move by Coach BeomSeok to put in a player that is a total newbie at the position, will it pay off?----!&lt;\n \nHighlights:&gt;!~10' GT Miss: **(WC 23)** attempts to clear the ball to the sidelines but **(WC 199)** ran towards the ball's path and redirected it on target, huge reactionary smothering save by **(WC 01 -GK-)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~10' WC Miss: **(WC 01 -GK-)** throws the ball deep to the centerline area and it bounces, the first touch of GT is a mess between **(GT 7)** and **(GT 18)**, the ball squirts out for an open **(WC 456)** to take a power shot on target that is aimed for the low middle part of the net **(GT 21 -GK-)** comes up with her first save with a huge block with her left knee!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' GT Foul: **(WC 452)** chases down a ball down the right wing, beating **(GT 7)** but getting hard fouled by **(GT 18)**, the coaches in the audience are calling for a yellow card, Yellow card is issued, the free kick is placed on the right wing sideline close to the 16 yard box, **(WC 119)** to take the kick-in!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' WC Miss: **(GT 100)** takes a sideline kick-in with a strong rolling pass to **(GT 18)** who messes up her first touch and **(WC 452)** steals, she then dribbles down the field and takes a shot on net that misses wide to the low left side by a few feet!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' GT Miss: **(WC 27)** makes a bad pass aimed for **(WC  23)** that **(GT 1)** steals and manages to dribble and take a shot on net that misses the mark very wide, aiming for the top right corner!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' WC Miss: **(GT 21 -GK-)** throws the ball down the middle with **(WC 119)** managing to get her head on the ball that re-directs forward, she continues the chase and manages to get a shot on net that misses the near side and she falls down at the goal line due to her momentum, **(GT 18)** was there to play some tight defense!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!13' WC Goal: **(WC 456)** takes a corner kick-in with a cross that hits **(GT 100)** in the shins and re-directs forward, **(GT 1)** misses the ball and it rolls to **(WC 23)** between the top of the 16 yard box and the centerline, **(WC 23)** takes a low power shot on target that goes through the legs of WC and GT players and ends up at the bottom left corner of the net and in!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' GT Miss: **(GT 1)** takes the centerline kick with a power low rolling shot on target that squeezes past all WC field players, great reactionary diving smothering save by **(WC 01 -GK-)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' GT Foul: **(GT 18)** messes up her first touch from a pass reception that **(WC 452)** steals and begins to break loose, only for **(GT 18)** to stick her leg out and hard foul **(WC 452)**, **Coach EulYong** yells for a foul and wanting a red card, **(GT 18)** receives her 2nd yellow card and is issued the red card, welcome back JinKyung, the rules for a red card is similar to ice hockey \"Major penalty\", a 3 minute 4 vs. 3 where the penalized player can still play the game after the 3minutes elapses!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' WC Miss: **(WC 27)** takes the direct free kick with a shot on net that is deflected by the defensive wall set up of **(GT 1)** the ball goes out for a corner kick, just barely missing the bottom right corner where **(GT 21 -GK-)** was positioned!&lt;\n\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' GT Miss: **(GT 100)** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot towards the goal mouth area **(GT 1)** cuts to intercept the ball but is thwarted by **(WC 01 -GK-)** who steps forward and smothers the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' WC Foul: **(WC 119)** outmuscles a bit too aggressively with a push on **(GT 7)**, the whistle is blown and a free kick awarded and located deep and near the centerline!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' GT Miss: **(GT 100)** takes the direct free kick with a shot on net that **(GT 1)** barely misses a touch re-direction, the ball misses the net on the short side low left corner by a foot, **(WC 01 -GK-)** was in position to block the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' GT Miss: **(GT 100)** kicks the ball down the right wing sidelines that **(WC 23)** tries to keep in but **(GT 100)** sprints down the wing and steals the ball and has a chance to shoot the ball, **(WC 01 -GK-)**  comes out of her net and attacks the ball and blocks the shot, the ball loops high on the saved re-direction and remains in play, **(GT 100)** falls down from the incidental contact from **(WC 01 -GK-)**, **(WC 23)** continues playing by trapping the bouncing ball and kicking a forward pass to a wide open **(WC 452)** on the right wing side who has **(WC 456)** wide open on the left wing side, all GT players are in WC territory and tracking back, **(WC 452)** manages to settle the ball down deep into the right corner area and tries to cross the ball but **(GT 7)** kicks it out for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!19' GT back to full strength with **(GT 18)** back in the game, WC had some chances but nothing on the scoresheet!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~20 WC Miss: **(WC 452)* takes a shot on target while falling down, the shot hits the near side middle right post and deflects out of bounds!&lt;\n\nFINAL SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- Giants 0 - **2 WorldClass**-----, what a team effort by WC, all players producing and playing well, the adjustments GT need to make to gain some chemistry in their offense and defense will hinder their development, dealing with uncertainty in their positions, having a lack of offense but there is hope with their skill levels, just need to get it together in a team effort------!&lt;\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!**AC** v **FM**, **Jeong HeIn vs. Park SunYoung**, the press conference JJJ states he will let HeIn kick the ball with only her left foot. Looks like SooAh will be active on offense, looks like a competitive back and forth game, can't wait!&lt;",

            "comment": "Last episode I mentioned that no other coach in the world would put their top scorer in goal, but &gt;!we found another one so soon :P And she started as GK too instead of being a last resort due to the red card as we all assumed based on the preview!&lt;\n\nIn hindsight I do believe that this game from the start was already decided due to the tactics of &gt;!WC coach. My beloved FC Giants never had a chance against such a quality team and especially the back 3 with Kathy back in her early form who would win almost every 1v1 and 2nd balls. The pressing from the front just played right into the strengths of WC with no one in Giants being able to hold up the ball now that KyungHee was in goal. But without her on goal the game would be over in the first 5 min, so that's a checkmate no matter how you view it...!&lt;\n\nIt does show that the coaches on the show are first and foremost football coaches and don't have the futsal mentality where you try to score 1 more than your opponent instead of being defensively solid, because good strikers are nearly unstoppable on a perfect and flat field, a bit like what NatFam JungEun has showed us in earlier seasons. \n\nI think we are slowly getting to that relative skill gap again: KyungHee, GaYoung, Saori! (&gt;!she deserved a goal, was so much more composed and in control of her dribbles and shots on top of her endless pressing)!&lt; and HyeIn to name a few have clearly developed better and/or faster than others on the show and will dominate most opponents.",

The level of play WC played at, with all the forechecking and running around that Naty and Seori did (both on offense and going back to help on defense) is deadly but if it only lasts for 1/2-to-2/3 of the match then, as we've seen in the past, they become vulnerable. This season WC seems to have the most endurance and can keep up their high energy, highly active play all match long. That's a HUGE advantage for World Class.",

I remember last season there were a couple of teams (maybe Giants, WW, Gaevengers, NatFam) that were already gassed out around half time even with a couple of younger players. And that was during the middle of summer with matches right when the sun was at the strongest... \n\nBut yes, relative to most other teams, they have an edge there and will always be tough to beat.",

On the long term JeongSun will do good in this position; she may not be as good as Irene or Kyunghee but she's still young and has this fearlessness inside of her. JinKyung is still rusty but I'd like to see her being paired with Kyunghee as wings midfielder with HyunYi as sole Forward. a bit risky but HaeNa can be center back with JinKyung and Kyunghee covering the wings back as part of their tasks. Both of them have the stamina for this. SeoRin should be trained to sub HaeNa or HyunYi when needed. Go Go Giants!  !&lt;",

            "comment": "# Pre-game: \n\n* I really enjoyed the opening with FC Giants. I wonder if Irene will really come back, but it's nice she at least speaks about it as a break for work (and to recover from injuries also, mentioned on her IG). \n* It's awesome to get Jinkyung back. She's not only one of my favorite women on the show but she was good and getting better before she left. She has ace potential. The fact that she has been training a lot since she left is great. \n* As for the goalie, what a tough decision. Scoring goals on this show at this point is really tough for nearly ever teams offense. Defending goals to keep the score low is critically important, as the manager said. I get that Kyung Hee killed their little tryout but... they did get Jinkyung back who would provide an offensive boost but she's not positioned as a striker. It's not easy to say \"I woulda went with Jeong Sun who looked the least bad and had potential\" when it might mean giving up 2-5 goals a match and knowing how hard it is, even with Kyung Hee on offense, to score 3-6 goals to win. If Kyung Hee is good enough at goalie, the offense only needs to score 1-2 goals to win. But this is amateur futsal and so I don't know that any goalie is consistently holding their opponent to 0-2 goals a game. It's a ROUGH decision. Giants would be so good if only one of the other players could play goalie even just pretty well. Having Hyunyi + Jinkyung + Kyung Hee on the field at the same time would be powerful. \n\n# First half: \n\n* Loved seeing the Saori + Naty through pass. The elevated play by teams this far in the show makes watching the matches so much more fun. I'm happy to see Saori's individual ball skills are upgraded. \n* Something I'm thinking about while watching is in the past we've seen evidence that Kyung Hee has a fairly fragile psyche. Playing goalie requires mental toughness to forget your mistakes (goals given up) and I could see her letting mistakes decimate her and it reduce her quality of play during the match. \n* Kyung Hee has been great but you give up that PK goal and now things look really tough for the Giants. Their offense just isn't built, with Kyung Hee as goalie, to score 2+ goals per game. Sure Kyung Hee can switch out to offense, put say Jeong Sun at goalie and they attempt to catch up by scoring goals but that assumes your offense can do that just because you want it to. \n\n# Halftime: \n\n* I don't blame the Giants coach really. If Jeong Sun had been at goalie against this World Class team, I bet she would have given up 3+ goals to them by half time. But on the flipside, your team has no offense without Kyung Hee. Especially when Hyunyi isn't feeling 100%. Stuck between a rock and a hard place. \n\n# Second half: \n\n* It's a bummer Hae-na has played for so long but still plays so sloppily. Whether it's a pass or on defense she still plays like a first year player. Add in her own-goals and penalties and FC Giants would kill for a defender like Yubin. \n* It's clear as day in the second half that the Giants offense has come alive. Multiple counter attacks in the first few minutes. \n* My point about Hae-na is made even stronger as she completely whiffs a defensible kick by Eva which rolls on into the goal (2-0). That play also represents to me the type of goals Jeong Sun would be giving up a bunch of per game if she was goalie full time.\n* I want to say back-to-back games with red cards but I'm not sure if these games are being played out of order or not. Either way, wild we finally got them and not when all the players were noobs. I guess it's like driving, you are most dangerous (likely to get in an accident) after you stop carefully driving and become a young confident driver. I feel for Jinkyung and dang, I really really really hope the floor of the stadium is softer than the old indoor field. I like that the editors continue to make a point to cut to the audience in attendance as they break down the penalties and make it clear that there is clearly no ill intent, unprofessionalism or anything like that. It helps defuse the situation and protects the players from criticism/hate/bullying online. \n\n# Post-game:\n\n* Yeah, I don't see how FC Giants win that match without Irene at goalkeeper. Not because she'd block everything, but the Giants needed Kyung Hee out there the whole time with a solid-to-good goalie all game to have a shot. Odds improve even more if somehow Jinkyung returned (not sure who would get bumped off the team then) but with all that said, WC still likely wins. They look like the better team no matter what. \n* Maybe it works in sports, maybe it lights a fire under some players butts to train more, but I still don't really like Beom Seok's post-game talk to the team. The time for criticism when your team lost, imo, isn't right after the game. I really prefer the managers who are positive and find a way to encourage and lift spirits rather than put down and criticize. \n* Interesting that Hyunyi recognizes her plateau in development. She's come really far from being a newborn giraffe tripping on air but the development you see in Saori isn't really there in Hyunyi. The ball skills and team pass plays that are still basic skills but veteran 'Kick A Goal' players are starting to develop them. I've noticed that she captains the team with an iron grip and loud voice while not being all that good but I recognized that's just another way she tries to help the team as captain. But she saw it as not a good look, which I understand. But I think the team needs it from her. \n\n# Teaser: \n\n* &gt;!God, He-in is sooooooooooo easy to root for and so likable. Her just deciding she's gonna train up her left foot is so badass. I love watching her play and the constant positive attitude and smile she wears while playing. !&lt;",

The &gt;!Giants lost not only a great goalkeeper!&lt; but lost out on so many opportunities due to bad conditions and overall weak mental fortitude. The coach did not help shore up their defenses and ended up looking like such a petty hardass. While I get &gt;!Kyunghee is their best gk!&lt;, leaving them without any decent attack options and a rusty &gt;!Jinkyung !&lt;left them so demoralized well before the first half ended. &gt;!Jinkyung was one of their best players right before she left but 8 months has left her too rusty to come hot into a new tournament against teams like WC that have continuously improved individually and as a whole. She needs much more time than 2 games can give her, which sucks since that means Giants will not even make it out of their group, especially when Hyunyi has off days like this match. !&lt;Even when other coaches' strategies sucked, at least we could tell they cared about the team and either gave them consolation or at least a clear path moving forward, but BS just blaming it on the team and leaving like that left a sour taste. Of course &gt;!WC!&lt; did super well, especially in their defense (that pressing is no joke) and they 100% deserved to win. Still makes &gt;!Giants !&lt;losing the way they did feel awful given they didn't give up much of a fight and just let things happen.\n\nI really hope the whole leaving thing isn't some scripted nonsense and just a really bad day for the coach and team because Shooting Stars is supposed to be pure, wholesome fun. I love me some character development and flashy soccer skills as much as the next person but first and foremost, fostering a community where female celebrities and those adjacent can freely play and have fun is why I got into the show in the first place. Are there shortages of coaches that can join? I just wonder with the show as big as it is, why don't they give some opportunities to actual coaches or ex-female players who might be able to invest more of themselves in the show? Can't be much worse than a few of them rn. \n\nAt least next episode looks to be more evenly matched with Heckham looking good (moreso than usual) so I'm looking forward to that. Group A matches are definitely looking to be the most exciting of the bunch and despite Challenge League still lacking in skills, their matches have been an absolute riot to watch too. Hope we move forward with more highs than lows and none of the players beat themselves up too much.",

                    "comment": "Firstly, KyungHee (FC Gucheok) is just a pure athlete. Her skills and instincts are something to watch out for. Just her presence on the front changed the whole dynamic of how the other team played. Granted she is also a monster goalkeeper. Now to the bad. FC Gucheok should not put KyungHee as a GK to begin with. Because her playing as a striker would change the defensive tactic of the other team  and make them more cautious. Irene departure does give a big gap on defense but they should have shored it up with 3 defensive players including HyunYi and play one top striker with KyungHee. That would have left so little space for FC WorldClass to run havoc on their side of the field. It was such a waste of talent and a bad strategy on Gucheok part. And come on coach! You should have sticked through with your players that were already demoralized.\n\nFC WorldClass is just an example how a team should stick together and grow together as a team. Each of them upgraded individually and played like a team, Passing plays within a small space made them a formidable team now, They were always good but unlucky in past seasons, but I think this is their time. There are now 5 kickers in a complete team. Lara played and kicked  with skill and confident now. Elody with upgraded stamina and mobility. Saori and Lara, what can we say. I think this game was played before Eva even got her knee surgery. She is just a \"defense mama\" of Shooting Star. Katy is backed to her oldself with that rush to cut off HyunYi, one on one play. However they do have a curse. WorldClass always won the first game on group stage and lost the next. I hope that will not happen this season. Let's hope this season is different.",

WC is one of those teams that don't have exceptionally great players (except maybe Naty who has a lot of potential imo) but they're all good together and that works especially well when the other team either has to change to a new strategy either due to injuries or players leaving like Giants. WC has no obvious holes so unless they get unlucky or they get outplayed by a few star players (which their defense has improved so it's going to be much harder for the opponents), I can see them giving 2nd place a real good go. I just personally think FM and depending on how Actionista plays next game have a stronger momentum going. Still too early to tell though.",

Overall they were playing season 1 level of play but with a more stronger reliable players now. There were no buildup and position understanding. Skill sets were also very limited other than PSY. They relied heavily on speed and physical strength for loose ball/counter attack. Very one dimensional, season 1 style. Coach JJJ was a good coach in taking advantage of it. They played for a shootout, not to win under field play time. Hence, luck based style which maybe good enough to take them to the next round.",

If it were to continue during the second half the defense was bound to break. We saw that during Gucheok World game. Attacking team is bound to score sooner or later because the defense will loose concentration or get tired. Plus putting PSY on offense also forced TopGirl to be more cautious in their play because they are still lacking on speed and power compared to Bullabang.

In fact, I feel that he was completely outplayed by his fellow coach &gt;!(No manmarker on Saori while giving up so much space everywhere, never mind not having a good plan against the high pressing which WC is known for) !&lt;and felt the need to lash out on his own players, which is a very bad trait as a coach...",

While I get the players were not in good conditions and were too nervous in general without Irene and having Jinkyung pretty much start afresh, the strategies the coach played were not effective. Instead of pivoting or switching to something to try to change the momentum (marking Saori, screening Eva so Hyunyi actually gets chances, letting Kyunghee work her magic cuz it's what the team is used to for the past few games, or putting Jinkyung solely on defense to bolster the weak Jungsun gk, etc.), he kinda just stuck with it until his team pretty much already fell apart and went all hail-mary on Kyunghee somehow soloing WC's already proven decent defense. It doesn't feel like the best of ideas honestly.\n\nMistakes can be made, and the team wasn't in a good position to start with for sure, but no matter how bad it ends up, he needs to be thinking about what he needs to say to keep the team together and improving next game. Maybe it's the editing, but there's letting him react to the loss and then there's seeing him gut the team while they're already down. Like you said, WC's coach was smug but he knew what he wanted and his players worked well to execute it. Maybe Soari's lucky PK wasn't expected but the defense completely stopped Giants from progressing and gave them enough opportunities to score a few goals.",

Just looked at how happy WC were when they found out KyungHee was playing goalkeeper. Because they know that Eva alone can handle the backline.\n\nIf they were worried about weak keeper in JeongSun, they could have pulled back HyunYi as a middle defender. At least that will put some pressure on Saori and Naty. Then put the top scorer last season as your lone striker. Overall bad stategy on Coach BeomSoo part.\n\nEveryone know that FC WorldClass is the most cohesive and consistent team, ahead of FC TopGirl. Along with their tough coach, we all knew that they would improve tremendously this season. This game showed that all 5 field players are able to control and kick the ball with speed, power and accuracy.",

I do believe it's because, World Class has always been weak against teams that have good passing, good cardio, good set pieces and good defense. Three of those are where FC Giants suffer the most. Their ball trapping skills are almost non-existent, so as long as you closely mark the recipient of the goal kick/kick-in,  chances are you'd force them to turn the ball over. Secondly, their defense has been historically one of, if not the worst in the entire show. They always score a lot of goals, but also give up a lot of goals. I still remember their 6-3 game against OTW in the second season, the 3-3 game against Actionista, the 2-5 final against FC Top Girl, etc.",

She\u2019s probably best goalie after Ayumi imo. She will be missed. I think they will need to find a long term solution to replace her. Obviously JinKyung was not up to par this game. She said she trained a lot but self training and playing are different you can tell she\u2019s slower and making lots of errors cause her body doesn\u2019t react the same. She has lots of potential for future though. A knuckleball is not easy to kick &gt;! kyunghee\u2019s athleticism was good coverage for the goalie position but honestly they shouldn\u2019t have started her in that position. Should have attacked aggressively in the beginning and then switched her to goalie for the second half. You can see how frustrated Coach was and HyunYi. She plateau\u2019d as she said but she\u2019s honestly one of the best players of the league still. Idk how much more she\u2019ll grow but with her ending statement it seems she is going to start again which makes me want to root for her even more!&lt; Gucheok always has a special place for me since season one as underdogs I would cheer for them. I will hope they get better this season. I hope to see SeoRin and JeongSun improve too. \n\nSpeaking of improvement, Lara and Elody\u2019s improvement was astonishing. &gt;! Them taking over for kickin\u2019s freed Eva for the long shot and unlocked more offensive opportunities for the team. It was a brilliant move!&lt; I think that concentration exercise they did in the locker room worked!! Because usually since they use a high pressing defense they lose concentration later in the game. This time Saori and Naty were on it the whole time completely focused. I was shocked, they seem to have even gotten better at passing to each other too. The short passes were also a thing of beauty. Honestly the teams that stay together really have the best chance to grow and win. \n\nFor next week\u2026I mean the previews make it look like He-in will just take over. AC will using build up, hold possession, and shoot the ball a lot. So I am guessing this is a fake and that maybe FM will actually win. We\u2019ll see, can never know for sure \ud83d\ude05",

Ayumi\u2019s strength is her zen like calmness and her ability to keep her eyes on the ball. Irene was flexible and lengthy, she had great reach. That\u2019s why I thought they were top 2. YooniP was a great keeper tho it\u2019s a shame she left. She basically saved them from being eliminated in that game. She had cat like reflexes and no hesitation to dive for saves. I can see Kisum be more like GV\u2019s goal keeper tho, she is more of a bold active type keeper. Fearless and quick to run out to clear the ball. Could be very good for OW since they thrive on counter attacks.",

So congrats and goodluck for Irene.!&lt; Her departure broke the balance of whole team - **big time**, because not only &gt;!Heo Kyung Hee can fill it up (which is fine) but the problem itself **without her** their attacking is missing- she\u2019s the only one can open the attack for them and create a chance for Lee Hyun Hi.!&lt; So this is a big crisis to hurdle for players and coaches to step up or else getting demoted to Challenger League, it will test their real character here.\n\n\n[When i said old habits never dies] It\u2019s for both team, &gt;!Saori still lack of finishing and striking power so she can\u2019t harness her speed, she basically needs an Blue Lock style of ego to amp up her game. That\u2019s applied for whole WC, their striking and finishing is lack except for Lara not only she\u2019s accurate but strong striking for a **defender**.!&lt; This one is linger for &gt;!Giants for a long time - **Passing is poor or almost nothing**, always rely on long ball (which majority of teams in show already broke away) and **fullback defense is a hologram** especially on that game they got bombarded of Saori - imagine if she has Kim Bo Kyung shooting + Giants new GK? She definitely gonna having a field daw on that + Giants isn\u2019t even fast enough to react for counters of opposing team.!&lt;\n\n\nThat game made &gt;!Coach Oh Beom Seok like a football terrorist, no adjustments prior to season. They look so vulnerable on offensive when Heo Kyung Hee is at GK and became defensive vulnerable when Jin Jeong Sun went on GK. Plus the fact WC basically *own* Giants for a long time he should be carefully look on what\u2019s lacking on them against a specific team that beat them for 3 times now.!&lt;\n\n\nPlayer of the Game : I\u2019m hoping for &gt;!Saori to excel as she was gifted for speed!&lt; so her problem now is to make a chances and finishing for it, she will be a great *can opener* for sure. She dusted the defender on 1 v 1 on open field but if she somehow had a dribble like Kim Bo Kyung or Kim Ga Young, that would be a nightmare for a defense to deal with.",

Right now like what as been mentioned on the threads for the last few weeks, tactics have become more important and the Giants for me had none in the second half it was pass to KyungHee and hope she does something amazing.  \n\nI must say FC World class look favorites right now, only team we still have to see in the SL is Actionista and we only saw previews now and I am not going to comment on that as every preview so far has given me a wrong impression of a team (Giants and national family) so I'll just wait to next week.",

World Class would tire out in the second half? It's a 20 minute game with around 5 mins rest at halftime. FC Giants should have come out guns blazing in the first half and hope to score at least two goals, then put Kyoung-Hee in the second half if he doesn't trust Jeong-Sun can protect the lead. World Class pretty much controlled 75-85 percent of the possession time in the first half. And even with Kyoung-Hee in the second half, WC still won the possession battle. I thought they would dominate every team now that KJK is back, but if Oh Beom Seok continues this trend of coaches putting offensive players at GK, FC Giants will be in the game to decide the 5th-6th place teams.\n!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Onto World Class, the entire team has improved big time!!! Saori is no longer a Lamborghini Tank, Eva, Elody and Lara's improvements at defense and kicking makes me believe they actually have a chance at the championship now. !&lt;",

Have JinKyung on the wing as a deep playmaker and Hyunyi with poacher duties, JeongSun as goalie and Haena bench. I would stress keeping Hyunyi higher up the field  and have her focus more on the attack rather than  defense. \n\nRight now they have relatively better physicals in the league, but their technical, passing skills, football IQ are awful. So I would concentrate on progressing wide allowing them to use the individual skills of Kyung Hee and Jin Kyung to carry the ball by the byline, with Hyun Yi on the hunt for empty spaces and loose balls.\n\nThe second option is to go for a counterattacking strategy. Low block and focus on getting Hyunyi and Kyunghee up the field as fast as possible during offensive transitions.\n\nFor both tactics I'd probably make the GK use longballs to Hyunyi for most of the time. Like Nat Fam, I don't think Giants have the personnel for a good build up. We could use Jinkyung as the sweeper for build up, but honestly with the team's skillsets I'd rather just go route one, increase the intensity of counterattacks and exploit the physicality/explosiveness of Giants.",

Unless they show drastic improvements. Likely they will relegate to challenge league and eventually maybe the team who finish 10th next season",

Even with Gucheok being bad currently, they can still beat any of the Challenge League teams. CL teams are currently playing reactionary futsal, with the exception of FC Balladdream. Whereas SL teams plays tactical style, because most of the players are more skilled and experienced in the game. \n\nCurrent CL teams are not ready yet to take on current SL teams. Maybe next season after the FA cups and they get more experience playing under their boots.",

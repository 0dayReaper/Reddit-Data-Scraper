(Canadian here, so maybe the shipping is ridiculous for SK? This could not be the same thing he has, it just looks the same. His might be some luxury brand. I remember he said it was expensive and he had to wait a long time?) \n\nEdit: sorry, I was looking for the women's shoes. It's definitely not the same, but close. The men's ones, you can even get a similar boot for $34.99 [clearance](https://www.mountainwarehouse.com/ca/plough-mens-snow-boots-p14255.aspx/khaki/)\n\nEdit: what's with the downvotes? \ud83e\udd14",

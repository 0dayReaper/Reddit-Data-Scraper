What are you doing here?), but the other 10% thought that just sucks! I wish Yongjin got a fair chance to try and fly under the radar. But overall a good segment! \n\nLooking forward to see how the crucian carp team (I have to mentally correct myself it\u2019s carp the fish and not crap!) can turn this around, but not gonna lie, my money is on mirror carp team!",

Even in the long jump race, if Jung Hoon would have jumped even little farther SUCCESSFULLY, they would have won. But because of Jung Hoon and Crush's silly mistake they lost.\n\nIMO YSC predicted wrong that Zico has used his all of his luck in Hokkaido.\n\nIt will be interesting to see the next episode and it seems from trailer the Team Zico will win most of the missions/games(I might be wrong).",

Episodes were also shorter and thus screen time percentage of the cast just sitting in a bus was larger. Lastly, out of every broadcasting stations' editing styles, I rank SBS the worst. Very similar to Physical:100's audio replay from different cameras over and over again. This style is very overused in every SBS produced show.",

Did you know that he was in a singing contest about his songs and voice - he was voted out really early. lmao I love it!! lmao Seriously, this guy is such a precious soul that in I live alone, he put all his dirty laundry in a bundle and went with it in a long walk in the streets to a laundrette. lol And he uses older stuff like MP3-player and foldable phone - I just love him so much for beeing quirky yet so chill.

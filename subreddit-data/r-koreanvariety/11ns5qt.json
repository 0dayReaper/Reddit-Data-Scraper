So naturally, you\u2019d get to know other groups and the music they\u2019re promoting by watching these shows. My personal favorites were Strong Heart and Star Golden Bell. I wish these shows existed now because this is where you\u2019d get to know your faves or even discover new ones. Any others?",

It was so entertaining, shinyoung should definitely mc again if this has a comeback, I don't mind the Male mc much but shinyoung made me laugh my butt off in every episode! I don't know how it'll work with the idols from recent gen though. I don't think they're experienced enough to banter with veteran mcs without some backlash from gp and/or fans. If it's pg-political answers(boring) only with the current gen I'd rather it not come back at all. Don't want another weekly idol, sorry not sorry.\n\nAgree with Weekly idol with DoniConi, saw them on Amazing Saturday and I miss them! And Heroes too. Again, this show had Narsha, Seo in young and Bong sun and the likes... I would expect the same kind of entertainment, not a milder version of what was once a truly enjoyable show.",

            "comment": "Invincible Youth for sure. It doesn't have to be the same setting, just idols with a few MCs interacting with each other and the community around them. The projects and chores could simply be ways for them to help the community/charity in exchange for rewards from the production staff, rather than the more direct exchanges of goods and services. That way it doesn't necessarily have to be a rural setting and they can travel to different locations from their \"home base\".  \n  \nStar Golden Bell was always fun with idols, but mixing in other entertainers like comedians helped keep it rolling smoothly and gave more interactions. The quiz format might not appeal strongly enough to current audiences however. May need to switch to something more active like relay games (shout in silence, charades, drawing, etc.).  \n  \nWeekly Idol has not been the same since DoniConi. That's a big loss to idols, as they were the best at making guests entertaining, allowing them to show off, and creating characters/talents for them. They also pioneered a lot of segments towards those goals and made those segments entertaining. You could watch the show even if you had no interest in the guests, and still enjoy it, which leads you to perhaps gaining an interest in those guests beyond the show.  \n  \nMBC Bouquet is a show which allowed interactions and competition between/with male and female idols. I don't see it being repeated any time soon because there are large numbers of fans who are still too sensitive with some of those interactions. I still don't believe I've seen every episode, as they are difficult to find.  \n  \nRoommates was another fun one. Not only idols, but a variety of entertainers and ages. You get different dynamics and scenarios while they are just basically living together and sharing chores/meals/recreation time.",

Maybe the revival could be paired with reunions between the older groups and their babies.\n\nETA: I just remembered that I love watching old clips of Shinee singing trot (can't remember the show name). Given how most younger kpop artists seem to be in a kpop/ Western music bubble, I think it would be fun to revive that show but only have them guess trot, traditional music, and less well-known genres.",

    "postText": "\nHaHa, Byul, and their three children to star in new family reality show, 'Ha Ha Bus'\n\n\nThe adorable family of five, HaHa, Byul, Dream, Soul, and Songyi will be starring in their very own, family reality show!\n\nTitled 'Ha Ha Bus', the reality program follows HaHa, Byul, and their three children on a trip across the country, as they meet friendly neighbors and learn aboard the most interactive school bus of all.\n\nThe trip is particularly meaningful to HaHa and Byul's family, as maknae Songyi is currently recovering from the rare disease Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome after being diagnosed with it last year.\n\nChildren will be able to watch and enjoy the interactive learning experiences along with Dream, Soul, and Songyi, while parents can also join in and discover family friendly spots to introduce everyone to diverse adventures. Various celebrity guests will also join the family, lending a hand. \n\n'Ha Ha Bus' starring HaHa, Byul, Dream, Soul, and Songyi is set to premiere some time in April via ENA, AXN, and K-STAR. \n\nSource:[x](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2023/03/haha-byul-and-their-three-children-to-star-in-new-family-reality-show-ha-ha-bus)",

I honestly think that this will be an interesting (and educational by the description) show.  I'm here for parents who honestly want to make memories with their kids. I hope everything goes smoothly and it is well received.",

I tend to find at least with Korean reality/variety shows, it doesn\u2019t feel exploitative as maybe it does in the west.  \n\nLike in West, normally the families that do it come from a reality TV background where it\u2019s their career.\n\nAlso there are some celebrities that create an SNS account for their children (but manage it themselves). \n\nBut I think the important thing with variety/reality shows with kids (and especially in Korea) is that they tend to only focus on young kids. You rarely see them stay in the limelight as teens or shows focus on teens. \n\nOne of the main reasons is young kids have no filters or awareness that you get as you get older. So they can say the funniest stuff. But also I don\u2019t think they are fully aware of the implications of being on TV.\n\nAnyway, my point is I tend to find reality/variety shows that involve children tend to be done tastefully. And Haha and Byul never come across as making money off their kids, it\u2019s more of I love my family and they are proud of their children and want to share it. You see it when Haha talks about his kids (mainly Dream and sometimes Songyi) in RM. \n\nAnd ultimately they aren\u2019t gonna force their kids to do something they don\u2019t want to do.",

What I'm saying is they should just play with their friends in front of the house like any of us did. They shouldn't get filmed for it. lets kids be kids.",

I'm uncomfortable with all reality shows about kids, too.\n\nEver since I read about the Dionne Quintuplets, I've felt really really uncomfortable with seeing kids on reality TV. There was an [article in TeenVogue](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/influencer-parents-children-social-media-impact) recently about kids growing up as \"influencers,\" too.\n\nI do think it's better that this is about a road trip/educational (as opposed to a reality show where there are cameras in the home), and it will probably be short-lived because that's how Korean variety tends to work, as opposed to some of the reality shows that track children's whole childhoods. But I still think it's good to be very skeptical of any content with kids in it.",

And it's like all of their children are completely babies, thus, they may make some mistakes on tv that they may get hate for. I kind of glad that Jae Suk never puts his family on tv or social media because he's trying to protect them, even though it would be cute/interesting to see his family and their interactions, like imagine seeing Jae Suk in father mode. But anyways, I hope Haha is careful in presenting his family and not showing everything that the public may see as harmful or whatever especially because his oldest son is growing up so fast and is approaching that age where they get edgy and developing their own person.",

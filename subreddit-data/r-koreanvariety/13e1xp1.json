    "postText": "Is there a sub for questions about Korean YouTube channels that do stuff like reactions, challenges, etc.?  Some of them seem to fall into the variety and reality genres, while others are harder to categorize.  There's a specific video series I watched from a channel like this a while back and I never managed to finish watching the videos even though I enjoyed them when I did watch them and found them funny.  Does anyone know where I could supply more details and ask for help finding the title of these videos?",

The video series had a theme of something like a girls' school, and all the girls on the show would do different activities and challenges in each video that were all related to stuff like makeup and fashion, and they often brought male guests that the girls would pair up with and do little speed-dating things and couple challenges.  I think the title was something along the lines of \"fantasy girls' academy\" or something like that.  I don't exactly remember how many videos were in the series, but I know all the thumbnails had pink borders.",

I get why longtime fans of the show in SK are pissed and calling the show a sellout because having a whole special episode dedicated to a love line which stopped months ago really feels like a last resort after the disastrous ratings last week. Hopefully the new production team in June can salvage what's left of the show.\n\nDon't get me wrong I absolutely love HDYP's business couple I think they're adorable and have great chemistry but forcing them to go on a date on national tv could be uncomfortable for them. They've been pretty awkward with each other since the Jeju Island episode which I assume is because of the dating rumours so this might make it worse imo.",

It's obvious that this PD is clueless about how to utilize the whole cast without sidelining some of them. Hopefully whoever they bring in later as the new PD brings the cast to their full potential.",

They must feel really pressured, and whatever they had felt for each other must've been squashed for good. Way to be a c\\*\\*\\*blocker, HDYP.",

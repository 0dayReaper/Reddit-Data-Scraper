Only problem is he\u2019s too skinny to pack strength to be able to beat his male competitors. The women were all probably strong since SH still struggled but they didn\u2019t seem to do heavy liftings all the time compared to the staffs who had to carry things around. Also, they both switched left hand. Compared to someone who works out and has lift weights with both hands, she\u2019d lose easy. \n\nAs for Dindin, Jongmin said to put your elbow close to you when instructing the girls. Dindin got pulled over to Seonho and SH was already running on adrenaline after winning his match\ud83e\udd23\n\n((If sh keeps eating like he showed on the show and keeps working out, we\u2019ll see him pack more muscle in the future\ud83d\ude0a",

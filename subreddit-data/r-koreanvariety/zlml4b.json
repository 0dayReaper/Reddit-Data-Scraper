The final ramyum and chill room and they seemed super comfortable with each other's company partying in the room. I also like how the producers gave the option to turn the camera off. It takes the pressure off the couple and I found it hilarious they ended up sneaking to the bathroom anyway. \n\nMvp shout out to Bella. She held up every episode with her back. She was a girls girl always supportive and was engaging on her dates. She deserves someone who can get on her level the queen she is",

It's like when your friends has a shady boyfriend that everyone knows about but the friend in love, no matter what you tell them they still stick with this man/woman. \n\nNot that KJ is a shady person, he seemed to be a potentially sincere person if he chooses to be. But he can also be a compete **** as he showed with Bella. \n\nSpeaking of Bella, while I love how everyone is calling her a queen and saying no one deserves her. I disagree because she deserved love and she deserved to be taken seriously. It's a shame how a lot of guys keep going for girls that put in zero effort while the girl that opens up and is fun is seen as easy.",

Bella seems (one of) the most serious in really connecting with someone *(flashback to their picnic date)* but Dan's probably not ready for that. With his drawnout antics, *(I have to fast forward the part his taking too much of the decision, although the editing could have done it tastefully)* I think he's there just to have fun, get some attention and not really for a relationship*.* It's the best for both of them but I agree that Bella deserve to be taken seriously.

How do people not like the host or panelists' commentary...why? This isn't school, church, or work why do people have to filter what they say? The show is Ramyun and Chill, the title alone is a euphemism and obviously, adult-oriented I feel you should be frank, and upfront to say what pops into your head. You could be wrong about it, but I feel it is much better, to be honest with your thoughts than insincere in your commentary. IMO, but that is just me so I don't get why people are so offended.",

Such a nice time for the dating show fans, lol.\n\nThere was finally a modern Korean drama version of **UnREAL with Rachel or Shiri Appleby**. In UnREAL they show you how shows like The Bachelor and so on are produced, lol. \n\nThat Kdrama is called **Love is for Suckers** (has Lee Da-hee and Choi Si-won), it just finished two weeks ago. Kingdom of Love 2 (the dating reality show inside Love is for Suckers) is mainly based around probably I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO (/r/IamSolo) and so on, like if you watch I Am Solo you'll see familiar stuff, references, et cetera.\n\n---\n\nA master list (of Korean dating shows) that some people update fairly regularly: **https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Igp0Nh8w46uA7uumTYeWoG4wV1kc4BJAn3R4cZgE7Uk**\n\nThis is a fan playlist of some Chinese dating shows (often available on Youtube for free through the YOUKU, iQiyi, Tencent Video/WeTV, etc. official channels): **https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNnLfxJ2ybB2BW4sjK1VTinwrySp7A_R**\n\nThat playlist of Chinese dating shows also has its own Google Docs sheet for other Chinese (dating and variety) shows, check the left side of the screen, it's above the playlist creator's channel name. Or here: **https://docs.google.com/document/d/12vG-7Qtu5KbNHGHFS8GNzolbf3Lmu_fUA0YL6lGXTAk**\n\n**Check MyDramaList too for a more visual list of these dating shows**. Some people have their lists with only Korean shows, others Chinese, some combined, et cetera.",

            "comment": "1. Bella is clearly the most attractive in this show in every way. But BECAUSE most of the cast members harbor anti-Black implicit racism, they actually didn't uplift Bella. Smfh &gt;:(  \n2. Changhak is clearly the best guy in consistency, honesty, etc. But he didn't get chosen because the one he fell for has poor taste. XD Note to everybody: Never chase somebody who is not on your level!  \n3. Pretty much everybody (e.g. Sonja, Hattie, Megan, Jin, etc.) who tried to downplay Bella and Erika's valid comments about racism needs to educate themselves on how they have privilege. Ex: Megan is a lightskin Black woman (in all people of color communities there is a colorist bias towards light-skinned individuals; I personally am a tan Asian woman who gets some pretty privilege anyways) so her comments are already not as empathetic towards Bella's or even Erika's situation  \n4. Personally I would rank the women's visual/physical appearance as the following, from prettiest to least: Bella, Erika, Tiffany/Sabrina, Sonja and for the men's visuals: Changhak, Chan, Minjae, Kyojun, and Dan. Notice how the LEAST conventionally attractive Asian man was lucky enough to have the PRETTIEST woman like him, yet he still went for a lighter-skinned Asian younger woman (Sabrina). Notice how he really wants the VALIDATION of OTHER MEN rather than to be with somebody who would appreciate him and who is already a huge catch. Smfh this is why I say to everybody,  NEVER give a mentally insecure person a chance XD",

She keeps this narrative of how none of the guys like her on the show bla bla bla when really she doesn't give the guys a chance. Chan picking Erika though erm good luck to 'em I guess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI mean look at Sabrina, Sonja but they handle themselves like a champ and they did well if I do say so myself. Bella looked great in her dress. And I love her letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was with that random comment on Black or White Knight gee LoL? I'm happy for Sabrina gettin' her chance in the rv with Chan they looked like 2 gossipy ol' ladies LoL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo obvious Changhak likes Tiffany but she's not feelin' it.. And perhaps she was perceptive on KJ ha-ha. Though them both are perfect for e.o. as they're kinda meh together LoL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was fun while it lasted. Not a fan of Megan's remarks on the panel. I feel Dan should be in variety or somethin' he's too extra ha-ha.",

Found it hard to actually get to know the people and it also made people look a certain way by not showing some of the footage.

Hattie and Megan pushed some terrible narratives (I do agree that KJ is boring as hell) but Tiffany being boring as hell despite just playing safe with strangers is a bad look. She is getting massive amounts of people flaming her.\n\nI don't even know shit about Sonja and Minjae. They are supposedly the best couple but how the fuck did anything progress and start?\n\nGet better people. Erika playing the race card is actually one of the most annoying things because Bella is right there winning almost all the rewards. Erika being pissy to the end was not good and they shouldn't have focused on it it so much. She basically only said yes at the end feed her ego. The editing is strange sometimes and the cliffhanger as to why Dan made that decision was not a good choice.\n\nAlso get people who are in Korea long term. The challenges are awkward and just the general interactions that they have to do is cringe. Even the cast thought some of it was cringe.\n\nI'll edit if I have more thoughts. I wouldn't watch season 2 unless they got new people. Also in their announcements, they said season 2 casting is available....with the same format. Foreign Women and Korean Guys.",

I agree that Korean guys likely would prefer Asian or white girls but I feel like she only brought that up as a response to getting rejected &amp; was looking for a reason as to why Changhak didn\u2019t choose her other than him just not being interested. She made an effort to pursue him (&amp; she bragged in her audition tape that men always choose her) &amp; it didn\u2019t work out. \n\nAfter that, she indirectly accused the dudes on the show for having a racial bias bc they\u2019re not showing her the attention she used to receiving from men outside the show. She kinda gave up &amp; disassociated from R&amp;C after that despite Dan, Chan, and even Kyojun making the effort to talk or include her.",

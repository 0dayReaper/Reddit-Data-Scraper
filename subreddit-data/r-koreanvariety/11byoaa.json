Joong Ki was for sure a full member even if he left a little less than a year in. \n\nPoor Lizzy. I truly believe that has Pledis been a better company that her life would not have derailed as much as it did. Her star was shining brightly in entertainment, with Orange Caramel, and with After School but they screwed up. \n\nIt made me so sad in the last episode that she appeared in that it really showed that her career had not gone the way that it started.",

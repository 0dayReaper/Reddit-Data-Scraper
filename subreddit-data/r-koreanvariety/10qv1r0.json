    "postText": "Since the start of quarantines, I understand that they have to maximize their content to make it 3 eps per trip because of Covid hindering with filming, but I was hoping now they can cut back to to having 2 episodes again. The trips are always fun for me, but during S4 there was a lot of down times that it was fun and at the same time, I zone out and had to rewind to rewatch it again. Although nowadays, I noticed that despite it being 3 episodes, the first and last episode of the trip are half the broadcast. So its still a 2hrs episode but in 3 weeks lmao I hope, since PD Lee has now started decreasing downtimes, he fixes it and makes it a 2 episode/2week per trip. :D",

Sorry my English is really bad haha I love what PD Lee has been doing since the beginning so far, hope he's still not getting pressured and that he get comfortable to his own style of running the show",

Or maybe it's because nowadays a trip ends in the middle of the episode and then cuts to a new trip. The feeling of the cheer they do every end of the trip feels more satisfying when it ends the episode as well. But that's just me, I guess. Haha",

It feels oddly satisfying when they make the closing chant on the end of the episode, it feels like we sort of ending the week in a complete way. But I just take what I can get lol, this is a very minor so it doesn't bother me much compare to when the members were scattered alone everywhere before",

I just noticed how they're finally decreasing the time but they're a bit stuck at ending trips in the middle for now hahah I also mentioned it to my sister who I was watching the recent episode with a while ago, it's so fun watching them all in the same car and bickering/making fun of each other. :))",

In the past, when S3 still airing, I just watch it all the way since I like the line up and chemistry. But since S4 start, I don't really feel it out, so sometimes I just randomly tune in the episode when I'm bored as hell but there no new entertaining things after I finish all manga, manhwa, youtube vids, and other variety show. But 1 eps per 2-3 weeks? Nah, it's way too far. \n\nThe best show is 1 eps that finish right away~",

I just said that I like it more if variety show air their show in 1 eps 1 week style. \n\nSo that's why, because I don't like it, I simply not watching it or just tune some random eps if I want to watch something for my free time when I already watch everything.\n\nI mean, I'm not really helping anything either I'm watching or not with the show so...",

S3 had a lot of 3-ep a trip when PD changed though, so it goes down to that. But a 1 ep per trip? Then we\u2019re cramming and cutting a lot of scenes for a 2d trip. Hahah 2ep is good enough, 3 is nice if they have a lot of content (many games, funny scenes, special episodes, guests)",

She looks like she's having fun which definitely brings up the mood of the episode as a whole.",

I can't remember how long since I last laughed this often throughout an episode of RM, but this one did the job for me.\n\nHaha shone through as an MVP for me. &gt;!The Mr. Tong during Strawberry Game, Dex ment on YSC, and that self-galloping in Zebra game!&lt; were all showing as a reminder of how seasoned as a variety veteran he is. Others also had their own moment, too.\n\n(Btw, seeing &gt;!Dex !&lt;in the graphic reminded me of &gt;!Game of Blood!&lt; again loool maybe it's time to rewatch that show)\n\nAs for the guests, Woo Jae seems more active than he ever was, as well as having his own little moment, which were all great. Yoon Seo has such an interesting character and reacted so well as a first-timer. With her eagerness, I feel like she will do just fine in variety if she ever decided to do so.\n\nAlso, the Strawberry Game suggested by Yoon Seo, and Zebra Game suggested by Woo Jae were simple yet funny. I am not sure who suggested to do it after Hyung In PD said \"We can't do that\" (YJS/JSJ?), but I was so glad that Hyung In PD decided to let it run as it was right away. This kind of chemistry between members' chaos and PD sense gives me a feeling that RM is still in good hands. :)",

It reminded me of her performance in the slippery climbing game in episode 620. &gt;!Personally, if she is acting I don't think it's funny at all. Optics wise, it just makes her look pitiful sadly. !&lt;",

I'm saying in general, I had expected to see the younger one overpowering the older as the older ages. Isn't that what should happen? I know it's not that massive of an age difference, but the different is still there.\n\nSoMin is now the same age as SJH was when she started the show (JSM). If I recall correctly, SJH was still performing well physically at that point. Mid to late 30s is still very young and there are many top athletes performing at those ages. So of course the younger person in her 30s will do better than a middle aged person in her 40s. \n\nBut even setting the natural decline with aging aside, SJH's lost a massive amount of weight recently, which makes her look very weak and frail. It probably isn't just age, because she's not even that old, but a combination of things mental and physical. She simply doesn't do a good job on the show; it used to be that she was just bad at the talk parts but now she's also bad at the physical nontalk parts too. I'm just trying to say, it's not that surprising that SoMin can do the physical stuff. I mean, she wasn't great at them to begin with; even her first appearance when she was 27 - she was barely keeping up. But it really shouldn't be sus at all. This was bound to happen.",

It appears I was mistaken.\n\nBut still, it is physical because most of them threw themselves into it. Standing and kicking would work, of course, but how is that fun for the viewers? A dramatic jump and the shots of them landing in either victory or loss is what's entertaining. \n\nAgain, not trying to excuse her. Whether it was her being lazy, her being old, her being unwell... I'm just saying it's pointless to compare the women. Why is that such a controversial take?",

            "comment": "Am I the only one who skip past the entire strawberry game? I don't understand why YJS and running man pd keep doing this game. Is quite obvious that YJS will purposely be bad at the game to invoke \"laughter\". Feel really stupid to be honest.is like they are treating the audience like we are 10 uear old to believe they are really bad at the game. It feel so force. The zebra game also. The same formula . YJS AND JSK will be bad at rhe gane on purpose to invoke laughter. I seriously hope running man pd can do better and not play this type of gane ever again. Is getting really old \ud83d\ude44",

As much as the cast says on camera how he's like family, in the episode when they stayed overnight you can see how he didn't really feel close with them. \nI somehow dislike him more than Jo Se Ho ( only cause when he's a guest the humor feels scripted everytime from talking about not dating JSM, about what YJS told him on call )",

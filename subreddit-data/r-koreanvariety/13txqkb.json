    "postText": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0vCJ2BgfY\n\nSummary: Hyunji was making a secret alliance with 142k the morning before the main match to bring down Jinho or Chulgoo because she feared those two were the biggest threat and she didn't want them to stay together for long. When it comes to 1vs1 she thought she wouldn't stand a chance against them, in the preparation for that, she wanted to slowly break them apart.\n\nIn the end, it didn't work out because he had trust issues, which was the side effect of giant man's trolling.\n\nIt's a bit of a shocker to see Hyunji was already thinking far ahead and even thought of bringing down Jinho or Chulgoo. But I respect that she didn't want to stay under their umbrella forever either.\n\nJungle team is really... no more :(",

I think it is wise of the decision of Hyunji to start thinking to eliminate Jinho and Xitsuh as soon as possible. At least for this point, Hyunji is better than Dex. I mean, Dex only cares about loyalty, but not thinking ahead to the future. If Dex has the skill to beat Jinho and Xitsuh in the final, that's fine. But I don't think Dex have even a slight chance to beat them.",

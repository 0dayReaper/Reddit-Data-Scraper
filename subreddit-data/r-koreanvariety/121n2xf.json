    "postText": "It's been over a month (probably) since there have been changes to the Korean Variety community.\n\nMajor changes were:\n\n1. The removal of the Weekly Talk &amp; Questions post that everyone basically hated, which allowed more freedom of new posts of questions\n2. The addition of Korean reality shows to the group, so 2 new flairs added\n\nJust wondering since these changes were implemented, does anyone have any other changes that could be implemented that others would like? (Note: if possible, could be implemented).   \nI remember members supporting more flairs or updates to flairs to be more specific.   \nI don't like the \"Unflaired\" or \"Live\" flairs, so may remove those.   \nI did update one flair to \"Questions &amp; Help\", which I find better.   \nOr do the changes have a negative effect on the quality of this community?\n\nYes, the 9 Korean Variety Rules on the sidebar still need to be updated.\n\nNot everyone on here likes me as a moderator, but as I stated previously...I try to be fair and apply the rules to everyone equally.  The other moderators do a great job, so if you don't like my decision, one is welcome to get another opinion.  \nAs a moderator, input (positive or negative) is always welcome, since it's beneficial to the community, so it's a good time to hear from everyone here. I'm sure the other moderators would like to hear how the community is doing.",

Either allow us to enter our own (preferred), or clean up the list (currently 7 Yoo Jae-suks) and bring it up to date with current shows/cast (entries for shows like Earth Arcade and cast like Mijoo). I think only 1 in 10 people use it right now because it's so out of date (and maybe it's only a new reddit sort of thing).",

    "postText": "For me, this show falls into second place among all the romance shows I've seen (first place is transit love s2). Currently, the show isn't subbed anywhere, but I've been able to follow along just with knowing basic korean. Even if this show is scripted I wouldn't mind - the drama is so wild- I say give writers deserve a raise! \n\nJust finished watched episode 11... and w/o spoiling anything, I'll just say that this show is a real tear-jerking and it takes you on a real emotional roller-coaster. \n\nOnly one episode left, so go binge-watch it now y'all",

Kinda like **Sleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774)** where they have shocking/ridiculous/etc. situations, lmao.\n\nIt was so surprising to see Chujeong/\uce04\uc815 in Love Alarm. Because I saw her a few times from the ZAMSTER/LookGating videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPhBXNyXtCg&amp;t=42s\n\nSame with Single's Inferno Season 2's Hanbin. Another guy from LookGating, Jeonghoon, is also in a different and new dating show called **Company/Office Romance (\uc0ac\ub0b4\uc5f0\uc560)**.\n\nSo many of them are from the Korean Youtube reaction/blind dating/etc. channels, lol.\n\nAnyway **Love Alarm: Clap! Clap! Clap! (\uc88b\uc544\ud558\uba74 \uc6b8\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9dd!\uc9dd!\uc9dd!)** is on the tteokbeokki site.

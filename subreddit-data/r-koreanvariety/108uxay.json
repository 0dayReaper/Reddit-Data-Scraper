They're inactive now but over the years they have dozens/etc. of mafia games with friends, family, other Youtubers, et cetera.\n\nThis is 1 hour and 45 minutes of a big Christmas mafia game, lol: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm_xdvGI8w8\n\nAnd then this was their last mafia game, with the roles/characters/etc. hidden for surprise or no spoilers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF-J-IfOcCM",

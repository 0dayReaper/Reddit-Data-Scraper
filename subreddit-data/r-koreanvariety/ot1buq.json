    "postText": "[Allkpop](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2021/07/tv-personality-park-soo-hong-registers-his-marriage-with-non-celebrity-girlfriend)\n\n&gt;On July 28, TV personality **Park Soo Hong** (51)\u00a0personally delivered news of his marriage via the Instagram account belonging to his cat, **Dahong**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The star relayed in a lengthy letter dedicated to his followers and fans, *\"Throughout these not few years that I've lived, I've always been full of fear. It was my way of trying to live without inflicting harm on others, but now, looking back, I see that I\u00a0was not able to properly take responsibility for my own life. I\u00a0am deeply regretting that now, through to the bones. So even if it's rather late, I\u00a0have decided that I will live my own life with responsibility.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Park Soo Hong continued, *\"Today, I have become the head of a household. I have registered my marriage with the person I love. The reason that we decided to register the marriage before any ceremony was because I\u00a0met someone whom I\u00a0wanted to have a future with, and we had mutual trust and love for each other. Only that. There are no other reasons.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Finally, Park Soo Hong stated, *\"Now, as the head of a household, as a husband, and as the father of Dahong who gave me hope during my dark times, I\u00a0will live for my household and begin building for myself a normal family of my own. My wife is a non-celebrity and an ordinary civilian, so please do not make any unnecessary speculations. In truth, I would feel burdened even asking for all of you to congratulate me or cheer me on. Because you all have already sent me so many more words of encouragement and comfort. So I promise to go on living responsibly and diligently, as not to disappoint so many of you who had faith in me.\"*  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Congratulations, Park Soo Hong!",

I honestly hope they pay for it. And I am glad Park Soo Hong is getting the happiness he deserves.",

    "postText": " [**Byul**](https://www.viki.com/celebrities/16380pr?utm_source=soompi&amp;utm_medium=soompi_news&amp;utm_campaign=soompi_link&amp;utm_content=byul-opens-up-about-daughters-recent-diagnosis-with-rare-disease-shares-update-on-her-recovery&amp;utm_content_id=1547131wpp) has recently shared a candid post about her and [**Haha**](https://www.viki.com/celebrities/15712pr?utm_source=soompi&amp;utm_medium=soompi_news&amp;utm_campaign=soompi_link&amp;utm_content=byul-opens-up-about-daughters-recent-diagnosis-with-rare-disease-shares-update-on-her-recovery&amp;utm_content_id=1547131wpp)\u2019s daughter\u2019s health.\n\nOn September 27, Byul took to Instagram to address her recent absence from social media and share that her and Haha\u2019s three-year-old daughter Song had been diagnosed with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. This rare neurological disorder happens when one\u2019s immune system attacks the body\u2019s nerves, potentially causing muscle weakness, reflex loss, and body numbness.\n\nByul wrote, \u201cI\u2019m updating you for the first time in awhile. Song was sick. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t do anything for awhile, including Instagram, \\[my YouTube channel\\] Byulbitube, and recording for my studio album\u2026As this happened so suddenly to such a healthy child, the sick child, our family, and I all had a very hard time.\u201d\n\nShe confirmed that Song was diagnosed with a rare disease called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome for which she was admitted to the hospital. After touching on the difficulties of their hospital visit and seeing so many young and sick children, Byul shared that miraculously, Song has recovered very quickly.\n\nByul explained, \u201cAfter being discharged and returning home, she is getting better every day. The child who was so sick to the point where she could not walk or stand on her own can now let go of mom\u2019s hand and do so on her own.\u201d Despite being so grateful for her daughter\u2019s recovery, Byul shared that it was bittersweet because she felt apologetic towards the other patients she had seen and asked for updates on their health if they came across her post.\n\nShe then elaborated on her absence, saying, \u201cWhen Song was admitted \\[to the hospital\\] and in a lot of pain, it was a situation where we didn\u2019t know when this disorder would get better and how much better she would get, so we couldn\u2019t tell anyone\u2026nor did we want to. However, at the outpatient clinic we recently went to, we heard that she likely wouldn\u2019t need medicine or rehabilitation so we are now sharing with you all.\u201d\n\nLooking back on the past month, Byul shared her gratitude for life and health and sent strength and prayers to all mothers currently looking after their sick children. Lastly, she apologized to fans and acquaintances for the belated update and promised to greet everyone soon healthily.\n\nAfter getting married in 2012, Byul and HaHa had their first son Dream in 2013 and their second son Soul in 2017. Their daughter Song was\u00a0[**born**](https://www.soompi.com/article/1338790wpp/haha-and-byul-welcome-their-third-child)\u00a0in July 2019.\n\nWishing Song a speedy and full recovery!\n\nSource: [https://www.soompi.com/article/1547131wpp/byul-opens-up-about-daughters-recent-diagnosis-with-rare-disease-shares-update-on-her-recovery](https://www.soompi.com/article/1547131wpp/byul-opens-up-about-daughters-recent-diagnosis-with-rare-disease-shares-update-on-her-recovery)",

Must be difficult to see those other children in the hospital.\n\nHow difficult that must have been and to try and pretend everything was okay while Haha was working on shows. You never know what's going behind the scenes and what they're going through.",

It can only be treated, her daughter will most likely experience other episodes or flareups throughout her life as this disease eats at the covering of the spinal nerves leaving the person with mobility problems. Doctors can give you treatment for the pain, but unless Haha and Byul opted to preserve the blood from Song's umbilical cord to use the stem cells as a form of gene therapy to help in her recovery, all they can do is put a band-aid on the situation and help with pain management and physical therapy. \n\nSaying that she's been miraculously cured is a disservice to other people who have it and to the parents of other children with it. Hopefully one day science will catch up and find a cure.",

Long-term neurologic deficits included sensory loss, limb weakness, and areflexia in 14, 8, and 5 percent, respectively.\u201d\n\nHowever, Guillain-Barre Syndrome notably has a better prognosis in children than in adults. In fact, \u201cAn excellent long-term recovery (eg, symptom-free or no disability despite residual symptoms) was observed in 85 to 92 percent of children.\u201d\n\nWondering if what you\u2019re describing is actually Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP).",

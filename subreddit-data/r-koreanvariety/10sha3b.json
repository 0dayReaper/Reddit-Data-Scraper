(i was really hoping that they also upload it on viu tho\u2026) \n\nanyway its also a bummer that i only get to see bits of daehoon in this season although he was the main star last season",

I\u2019m actually really surprised Netflix even picked it up and it seems to be our only option for now. I\u2019ve been looking for subs elsewhere since S1, and have not been successful. Here\u2019s to hoping TVing becomes available outside SK, and that they actually roll out eng subs for all their content. \n\nOn a more happy note, less than 48hrs till the next ep on Netflix, can\u2019t wait to see how they wrap up their Qatar trip \ud83d\ude06",

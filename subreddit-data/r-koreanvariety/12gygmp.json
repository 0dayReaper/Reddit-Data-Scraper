Although I feel there's a bit improvement needed for some of the games they've played but the chemistry of the cast is making up for it, the games they've played by themselves has provided some of the best moments.\n\nI knew something was up with the mafia game because &gt;!Yena wasn't trying to be sly at all and Chaewon was acting like she hasn't played or seen Yena play Mafia before, during whenever IZ*ONE played mafia or some type of these games Yena was almost never caught lmao. That was a tell that Chaewon was the one acting sly now.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!That said at least she got revenge for her members after all these years of Yena fooling em, either due to the members just being easily fooled and by Yena's acting skills lmao!&lt;",

I appreciate cardboard Chaewon getting all the praise and hate--and had 3 separate wielders as each one messed up. The box game was fun, though I think I was about half way though that game before I fully grasped what they were playing for. I have no idea how Miyeon watched Leejung catch and out Chaewon as a mafia only to turn on her the next round. I don't think I like the cover art game as much as the 1s music or dance game. It seems like they are giving out two or three clues just to try to give them a chance at it. It's always interesting that without subs and without knowing many words you can still appreciate the physical aspect of variety shows, and when they turn on each other after failing.!&lt;\n\nWith subs: &gt;!Definitely the best episode. While missing the nuance, I still grasped 90% of what was going on without knowing more than 4 or 5 words. I still can't believe Miyeon got played like that in the Mafia game. Also, how could they not realize Chaewon was a mafia with Yena squirming and planking around on the couch in frustration and anger. I do think half of the cast overreact too much, but I appreciate the other half calling them out on it as a joke and maybe they will tone it down a little going forward.!&lt;\n\nThe subs work with sniper, just push them back by 37 seconds.",

Sorta scripted like but not intentional a bit?\n\nYena acted like she was bad at the game and Chaewon acted like she didn't really know much of Yena and how she plays or like I said her personality lmao which for her side makes sense because she was one of the mafia but still, felt like they were taking it easy for the others to get more screentime out of the whole game. I'd understand if it was the others but these 2 are literal besties even during IZ*ONE day who also played mafia and other similar games lmao.\n\nHope there's not much of these moments in future episodes, kinda ruined the flow for me when I was watching the ep but it was salvaged when both of em were gone in the game lmao.",

Since the amount of cash points is predetermined, you can try to estimate what the staff would give them to rule out some answers, but it's hard to do at the beginning since there is so many possibilities to still have a reasonable amount (ie the time they didn't believe they would get a \\* 10, because it would get too high, but they got it and several / after), and at the end, it's also hard to guess if the staff intended 2500 vs 3000. Maybe they should have revealed the amount of cash points they could earn? It would be random at the beginning, but could lead to a big streak at the end if they find out the way, that could be easily edited to make it epic/interesting, imo.\n\nMafia game turned out to be quite fun, the machine is quite unnecessary though. I don't really know why Miyeon did not trust Lee Jung after Chae Won was voted out, but good deception from Patricia. And great idea from Hye Ri to bring some content outside the games.\n\nThe covert art segment seems quite easier to me than the previous games, I got 9.5/12 (0.5 because for Stray Kids, I would have found it once they were talking about them but I wouldn't have found it alone), where the other games seems that much harder.",

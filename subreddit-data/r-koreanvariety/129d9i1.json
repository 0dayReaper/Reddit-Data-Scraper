Ryu Eun Gyu will get married with his Brazillian GF somewhere around October, Lee Ji Hwan, the karate guy, will get married as well. And here comes the shocker, our captain, Lim Nam Kyu has a girlfriend and HE WILL GET MARRIED AS WELL.  Now, you might be saying 'why are you so shocked at the news?'. Well guess what? I'm not the only one who's feeling this way, AJH is just as shocked as me. I mean the boy never really disclose anything abt his girl and yall need to give me a space to rant because he is my bias. But after a few days of self-talk and pillow-punchings, I realised that no matter what happen I love his soccer skills more than anything. I just hope that he will never stop playing soccer and improving day by day. Our captain is still the best.  Oh yeah, I forgot to add that AJH suggested for a joint wedding (or  to go to the member's wedding together? My korean is not that good. Btw this video is not a part of Ep74 on Netflix which is disappointing).\n\nFunny points:- Lee Dae Hoon is worried that Lets Play Soccer will be done for and the fans will be disappointed (which I was)  after he heard the marriage' plan. He can't really complain tho, I mean he married with kid. Last but not least, Heo Min Ho hoped that his bunny teeth will fix itself and Kim Dong Hyun joked about if Min Ho wants him to push the teeth in or to take it out. \n\n(P.S. Dear Lee Jang Kun's fans, he is married. So lets be miserable together. HAhahahhahha)\n\n [Lee Jang Kun's Insta](https://www.instagram.com/p/Co-M3fLJKnX/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)",

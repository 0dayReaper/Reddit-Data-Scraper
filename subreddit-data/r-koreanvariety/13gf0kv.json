The only way I see eliminated players still contributing to the game is by manipulating the game as outside factors but not being counted as players anymore. Or maybe phantom casino would result in a collective showdown between the eliminated players and allow one to return back to the main game.",

Also, every decision is live and death that's why it's a surviving game in the first place. You can't always got bailout from your mistake. Realistically there's no sign that those eliminated return in the next episode. People are baited from the trailer",

Just from a entertainment point of view I would welcome them but they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to win the main prize money. I\u2019d at least like to see them as special guests for 1 or 2 episodes because they\u2019re such characters.\n\nYurisa is literally the beautiful, cute, psychopath trope you see in anime and dramas. From appearance to personality. What a freaking character hahaha. \n\nJimin, just the way she forms clicks and how influential she can be is really interesting and amazing. She\u2019s a force to be reckoned with. \n\nKind of crazy how the two females and Sung Joo who are all finalist tier got eliminated so quickly. I bet the producers were like DAMN IT!!!",

I almost became a fan of her because of season 1.\n\nBut, I also get it that the main purpose of her appearance in this season (besides obviously winning it) was that to fix her public image, to possibly make it morally righteous/acceptable.\n\nAnd, she did left with audience sympathizing with her, I guess.\n\nBut, coming to your post's main point, I do not want any of the eliminated to come back because it will be unfair to current roster; even if they were eliminated unfairly, that is just the game - they signed up for this knowing full well about the nature of such a game show (unlike that man-child short tempered basketball player, also wasn't expecting such a mature wholesome no-retaliation response from Dex). \n\nThey (and us the audience) should accept it and move on.\n\nEdit: grammar",

            "comment": "Looking at the subtitles (by Kocowa), the narrator only states \"The player who gets eliminated can't come back to Bloody Game\" only after the players split into teams. This is further supported by a following subtitle that \"The third player to leave Bloody Game is Hyun Sung Joo\". Considering that Kerrigan May left in the first episode, Yurisa in episode five and Sung Joo in episode six, this is consistent and makes sense. \n\nHowever, though it seems probable that Jimin will come back after being eliminated in episode 3, I don't think the pants in the last shot look similar to what she was wearing previously. So maybe I'm reading too much into the subtitles",

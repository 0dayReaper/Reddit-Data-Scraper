It was hilarious with the crazy mat arrangement and them getting confused over which team actually had the advantage. It was so sweet to see Kim Dong Hyun giving So Min so much encouragement and she did so well! I'm so in favour of him being a part of the cast as LKS' replacement (if they are going to add a new cast member). It's nice to see someone who can match KJK physically and fit in so well with the rest of the cast.",

Which means it's been less than 2 months. So I assumed she would still be filming. Usually, if she has free time she travels. It's actually when she is filming something that she does more physical activity like golf and going to the gym. But if it helps you sleep better at night, let's pretend she is just hanging around I guess. Afterall, if she shot a whole full feature length movie in less than a month or 2, she deserves a few weeks of break tbh. That kind of thing would mean at least 18 hour days. You know, shooting a movie isn't just standing somewhere and rolling a camera. Heck, most of it is just waiting for the exact right natural lighting and for the crew to move everything to the next location and take after take and rehearsals and location scouting and people getting sick, equipment not working, sound having issues, lots of having to go back to do ADR and a lot of other stuff. \n\nSource: trust me, I wanted to be a filmmaker at one point. The behind the scenes stuff are not as glamourous as Hollywood make them seem. It's a lot of time and patience and lots of admin stuff. At least for most industries. But again, not sure how it is in SK. \n\nBut you insist on her being super free, and you look like you keep tabs on her activities and social media updates. So you must know better.",

So you must know better.\n\nlol I was a bit startled by your response but I'm going to go ahead and give you the benefit of the doubt here. Because no way you got snarky just because someone told you JSM was done with her movie filming, right? Of course not. That would be insane.\n\nAnd to clarify: I'm not \"keeping tabs\" on her. I follow all of the RM members and multiple fan accounts because I like seeing what the cast is up to. I also wasn't insisting anything. I let you know that her schedule was finished, and then explained how I knew that. That's all. \n\nGood luck with your filmmaking career. Peace.",

So of course my first response is to think a user I've seen multiple times throw hate at JSM now acting like they're a fan who knows her schedule personally just to say something \"negative\" about her; it's because they were waiting for a chance to be negative. (Negative in quotes because it isn't even a negative thing. Like I said, if she shot a movie in less than 2 months that means it was a really difficult shoot and all the cast and crew from that must be exhausted, so in fact a break is much needed. But this coming from you sounded like mocking and negativity based on your previous comments, so...) \n\nAnd you very much insisted on it. Otherwise, you wouldn't have replied twice. Your answer wasn't \"offering\" anything, you were in fact insisting you knew someone's schedule because they were posting golf pictures. \ud83d\ude01 You're saying she's done filming as a fact. It sounds like you are her management team or something, you're so confident. Remember I never said she for sure is filming. I said I thought she would be because I assumed a movie shoot would last a few months. None of the cast have posted things about the shoot either, which I believed to mean they aren't done yet. \n\nAnd I did get snarky because of your comment. I don't need you to give me the benefit of the doubt. You basically only comment negative things about SoMin. So be prepared to be thought of as a hater. And the negative you talk about her isn't criticism, it's actual hate.\n\nLike this is literally something you've said: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10t0o7w/february_variety_star_brand_reputation_rankings/j79rtny/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1&amp;context=3\n\n&gt; \"Third most screen time for women\" is just another one of those fake awards that even the RM members made fun of. But I hope it helps your bias get more work, she needs it. Keep flaunting that fake award around while throwing a temper tantrum\n\n\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f In fact, you seem to hate most women because you go around writing the same demeaning things about SJH and MiJoo as well. Excuse me if I don't believe you saying you are a huge fan who follows the people's career. You seem to follow their careers so you get a random chance to say something negative about them \"with evidence\".",

I'm surprised nobody caught up, because he was being so obvious with it. It was probably thanks to SoMin going crazy on the other team. \ud83d\ude02 The maknaes were really going all out and creating more and more chaos. \n\nThis is the second time I believe that someone has won and also done the penalty. \n\n&gt;! SoMin staying for extra work to help out her uncles was so cute and wholesome. I will legit watch an entire show of just these three and the two of them being forced by her to do cutesy things and hating every minute of it but they can't get mad at her cause it's for a good cause and she's enjoying herself. \ud83d\ude02 !&lt;\n\nAnd that footvolleyball was epic. One of the best. Goes to show what support and encouragement does for people. \ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit: the next episode will be the first of the vacations. Well, they don't seem like they're in Mapo and I don't see any temples. So I'm assuming the plans they came up with don't have to be adhered to, they're more taken as \"suggestions\". It's just that the episodes are planned by certain people or inspired by them. Also kind of found it funny that the person who is always on their phone (but also ironically doesn't know how to use it and isn't on any social media apps or messaging apps) suggested a no-phone nature stay. \ud83d\ude01 They barely use their phones anyway, so not sure how that's gonna add an interesting element. Yu JaeSuk throwing a tantrum because he was told to go to sleep like a baby was the highlight. I'm guessing these vacation series Episodes are gonna be the members suffering each week while one person enjoys themselves. \ud83d\ude01",

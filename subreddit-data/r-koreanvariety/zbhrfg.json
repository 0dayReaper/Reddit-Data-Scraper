At first I thought you meant \"Our Kid Has Changed Returns\" that has parents, kids and counselors deal with finding the cause of a child's bad behavior and then helping solve the problem with counselong and other ways... I cried watching one episode since the parents and sibling were so mean to the troubled child and his older brother was hitting him constantly but he had poor verbal skills so couldn't tell them what was happening until they saw it on the video cameras \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22",

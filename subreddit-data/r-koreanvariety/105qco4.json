I wasn\u2019t even in the show and I feel the same \ud83d\ude02. \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CnCFK3Iv9Cq/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\n\nI think everyone by now are aware of the fact that Igeon and Lana exposed the whole show and how they were forced to choose different people. Even in the end Igeon according to the script wasn\u2019t suppose to choose Lana but still did which is why it may have felt confusing for us as viewers. \n\nAnyways what do you guys think about this new couple? And what do you guys think about Dohyun writing on his story twice that the show was 100% real when fans, Lana and Igeon claimed it was scripted.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CnHMG6mvtCg/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y= \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CnHMW0DPBrk/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CnHMGY6PlWZ/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=",

Her chasing YJ for 6 episodes even AFTER she knew he ONLY like Seo Eon and especially the fireside chat in ep 6 and she is very aggressive and manipulative toward him... She is an actress and been in about 5 dramas and FL in a movie... She is in ep 10 of First Responders and has a MDL profile page.... i think the PD wanted her to play a shy girl character that doesn't take no for an answer just like she said her only bf was a guy she pursued until he gave in and she tries to do the same to YJ too so scripted .. Also the tug of war when Jin Young arrived he won in about 2 minutes since he placed himself in the forward center of a V formation which is the easiest to win in a 3 way tug of war so he would win and take women on a double date... Usually the newest guy or girl gets to chose a date(s) when they arrive on most reality dating shows I watch... YJ and Seulki were the most popular from Day 1 among the men and women so they played ML and FL with 3 people chasing them until Jin Young arrived and he became the new ML....Soo E and Seulki always being paired in physical challenges together since they are the least athletic and would lose quickly to the other 4 female contestants plus the last challenge all the women were in a line and every ball they drew was the exact same as the person standing next to them in the exact order was way too far fetched (green, green, blue, blue, red, red, yellow, yellow)... Seulki would lose since she isn't as aggressive as Soo E plus Soo E needed to go to Paradise so we could learn her age and job since they made the stupid rule you can't talk about your age or job to anyone except in Paradise!&lt;",

In singles inferno it\u2019s clear they set up certain conversations as it\u2019s not very organic and the producer influence is obvious in regards to they try to set up who wins the paradise dates to maximise the content so different parings will form -but atleast that\u2019s not too bad but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the producers kept hyping so-e up to keep going for YJ, saying she still had a chance so she keep acting crazy.

            "comment": "As a longtime fan of Lana, pretty happy for her. Wish she trains more and release Kpop music. There's a lot of survival shows for girl groups still, really hope she can find some success. \n\nLana's story might've been different if she'd been trained in a better company, her visuals would've made her huge in Korea and China and so on, no doubt. Her vocals would've been really good too if her vocal coaches and so on helped her develop better technique and such.\n\nAlas not a lot of us have connections especially in a foreign country and so ya, it's a hard road out there for the non-Asian trainees that dream of debuting as a Kpop idol. \n\nMaybe in a few years when JYP and so on introduce their American/European/etc. groups, the foreigners would be more accepted and celebrated.\n\nLike yes the Chinese, Japanese, and Thai members are really a staple of the industry now. But as Kpop becomes more global, hopefully the groups with other ethnicities don't get as much flak/etc. just for having even more foreign members.",

            "comment": " I think all adults watching any show on TV must know it will be scripted to a certain extent. Let's say Eigeon didn't want to pick Lana on the show and it wasn't scripted. But now he is with her right? He could have changed his mind. There is no hard rule that he has to date who he chose at the end of the show.  \n\nReally happy to see Lana with Eigeon in real life and not that piece of shit walking red flag.",

Overall, I know drama is fun to watch, but I hope people understand what real respect and healthy communication and boundaries looks like..and that while we can't control our attractions and feelings, we can control our actions and are responsible for them as well...",

There is a reason why they changed stuff like Kakaotalk in Parasite translations to fit the country it's aired in. You need an understanding of the target audience to make a good translation. These games translate terribly since they are pretty specific.",

However, as a person that knows some level of Korean, it's definitely hindering. Watching Korean shows with accurate English subs helps me learn Korean better, but if you put out \"correct English\" within the context as subs I'm missing out on learning new words.",

                    "comment": "Yes I prefer that too. I also hate when translators translate english words to a different english word simply because use the english word slightly differently. Its so frustrating. \n\nI think translators tend to forget that everyone in the world has learned their native language using context clues. We aren\u2019t stupid. Its pretty obvious when koreans use an english word for something slightly different.\n\nThe same thing goes for made up translations. If something really doesn\u2019t translate just let that live as romanized hangul.\n\nOne of my favorite translations was a fansub and at the beginning they had a short list of the korean honorifics like, Oppa, Nuna, Hyeong, Seonbae. Instead of use dumb shit like \u201cMiss, Mister, and Teacher.\u201d They acknowledged that it doesn\u2019t translate and because of this it was remarkably easy for me to understand the societal respect that comes with these titles. \n\nI don\u2019t think its nearly as bad, when translators use the persons name instead of the honorific, if you aren\u2019t paying close attention most viewers won\u2019t notice this, but its still detracts from the viewing experience in my opinion. I feel like its not difficult to expect viewers to learn about honorifics, its the basic building block of all social interactions in korea, its so important for comprehending what is happening in kcontent, and it happens so frequently that theres no way that people would have trouble learning these words.",

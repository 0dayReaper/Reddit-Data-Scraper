    "postText": "# Description\n\n&gt; Love Catcher is a show featuring a group of men and women coming together for love or money. In this event, men and women who do not know each other will live in the same house. But before moving into the house, participants must choose between two identities: 'Love Catcher' or 'Money Catcher'. Later, 'Money Catcher' was seen forming sincere relationships with other 'Love Catchers'. On the other hand, 'Money Catcher' can win almost $50,000 if they can become a couple with 'Love Catcher' at the end of the show. When making romantic advances, there's an added mood of caution as participants can only guess who's there for love or money. \n\n# Panel\n\n* Jang Do Yeon\n* Joo Woo Jae\n* Jun Hyun Moo\n* Gabee\n* Kim Yo Han\n\n# Cast\n\nMale Participants\n* Park Yong Ho - [@hoho_dragon](https://www.instagram.com/hoho_dragon/)\n* Cho Seong Beom - [@laul_sb](https://www.instagram.com/laul_sb/)\n* Park Jung Hyun - [@junghyuniiii](https://www.instagram.com/junghyuniiii/)\n* Kim Yoon Soo Ro - [@kimyunsuro](https://www.instagram.com/kimyunsuro/)\n* Kwak Tae Hyeok - [@kwak_taehyeok](https://www.instagram.com/kwak_taehyeok/)\n\nFemale Participants\n* Kim Hyo Jin - [@h3_1o](https://www.instagram.com/h3_1o/)\n* Hwang Soo Ji - [@t_110771](https://www.instagram.com/t_110771/)\n* Lee Yu Jeong - [@ririyujeong](https://www.instagram.com/ririyujeong/)\n* Choi Tae Eun - [@c.taeeun](https://www.instagram.com/c.taeeun/)\n* Hong Seung Yeon - [@applemang0o](https://www.instagram.com/applemang0o/)\n\n\n# Episode Links\n\n|Info|Link|Notes|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|RAW|[Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uP41137xW?p=3)||\n|Stream|[VIU](https://www.viu.com/ott/sg/en-us/vod/465040/Love-Catcher-in-Bali)|^(ENG SUB)|\n|Softsub|[Download](https://link.emediaarts.net/lovecatcherinbali/lcib-episode-3)|^(ENG SUB)|\n\n\n# Important Update on Episode 4\n&gt; Due to internal circumstances, this week's &lt; Love Catcher in Bali &gt; episode 4 release schedule has been delayed by one week.

Maybe because YH is such a good person that the contrast makes SB look bad, but idk I feel like there is a dark side to him under the surface.",

Just this episode she came into the men's room, he moved to the back end of his bed to give her comfortable space and as their conversation went on, she leaned forward and inched closer. She is an \"act first, think later\" kind of person. So it might seem like transparency and the contrast makes him seem reserved/weird but I think So-Roo's approach is wiser. It really has only been 3 days since they met so I think it's good not to open yourself up completely to someone who you don't know yet and who could hurt you.",

They're only going to be in Bali for 4 more days. What happened to the competitions where the best couple/team can get clues on the other contestants? The photo shoot was nice, but it's essentially a three-way date.\n\nI figured Yong Ho was a &gt;!Love Catcher. First is his career as a teacher. Second because he comes off as too considerate and passive to be a money catcher. I'm rooting for Yong Ho and Hyo Jin to be together. Soo Ji is very pretty and holy smokes she looks hot in that bathing suit, but she can't read the room at all. I laughed when all the other girls implied she was a \"sweet summer child\" during lunch.!&lt;\n\nSeong Beom basically declared he was a &gt;!Money Catcher. The way he talked about Soo Ji felt demeaning like he's already claimed her as his property or something. !&lt;\n\nGood season so far, but I want to see more competition!",

Her expression [here](https://i.imgur.com/w0oNNn9.png) so cute. I really think she is a love catcher. She really tried her time with Junghyun but.. oh well.\n\n(3) I knew it Yongho is a &gt;!love!&lt; catcher. Moreover, he is a catch! He is very considerate to people. Seongbeom, &gt;!you money catcher!&lt;, really had the guts to say about mustering courage among the boys.\n\n(4) Yongho is doing fine, even Sooji reciprocate corny jokes to him. I think it is so sweet. For this ship to sail, she should be a love catcher. (I kinda doubt it though, that's why my next point...)\n\n(5) ...The possible loveline between Hyojin and Yongho is welcome. I am disappointed with Junghyun in this episode. I can't point something but he got so weird knowing that he isn't the oldest guy in the house. *(Also him cutting Seungyun and Sooro's conversation short! I'm fuming.* \ud83d\ude24*\ud83d\ude21)*  I like Yongho's attitude the most. From the preview, Hyojin and Yongho had some quite interaction, and with Junghyun nudging her away, she's ready to move on. Or maybe she seems investigating whether he is love catcher or not. IDK, either way I am rooting for her too for Yongho, whichever ship works out.\n\n(6) I really like the love triangle between Taeeun x Sooro x Seungyeon. As much as I think that Sooro and Seungyeon could be money catchers, I would like to know how this will pan out especially with Seungyeon's overdose of heart-fluttering words. Her confession is the sweetest. Her friendship with Yujeong is so cute too, them scrunching up their noses like they have a secret friend language and helping the other to have some privacy with the person she likes.\n\n* Sooro sharing about him being just a shell and have nothing to offer is an evident clue that he is money catcher. After listening to Yongho's motive as a &gt;!love!&lt; catcher, I couldn't imagine Sooro explaining that he is a love catcher, he probably is in the stage of his life where he needs money. That isn't bad for Taeeun and Sooro's relationship though, I think he suits the married life with Taeeun if they ever decided to take things further. But marriage could be too early for Sooro.\n\n(7) About the newcomer, I agree that he and Yujeong have good chemistry. Her voice when she saw plenty of garlic. I think she likes older guys that's why her interest with Sooro waned. Also, I want to ask WHY did the newcomer picked his identity **before** meeting the women? That's just different from the other participants, I wonder if he has some benefit or something in the future.",

I didn\u2019t have any opinions on her before this, but major respect for putting it all out there like that! Even if she is money (I think she is), it\u2019s still hard to say your feelings so bluntly. Although, I don\u2019t really see it swaying SR, who I think is money, because he knows he has a sure thing with Taeeun, who he thinks is love. But, with that said, can\u2019t wait to see their love triangle unfold, especially with that preview.",

Also, the way SR looks at her when she\u2019s not looking is really charming. For some reason I get that SR was treating SY like a friend? I think her confession surprised him. I wonder if her efforts will pay off? That preview was kind of weird for me lol like that\u2019s so awkward. I kind of get money catcher vibes. \nI\u2019m glad that the other girls are becoming more active. I wonder who the new guy will go after. I really am starting to like YJ as well.",

SR mentioned that he doesn't want to spend time with others unless it's with the person he is attracted to, and we saw him be considerate to SY while she washed the dishes. They did build a bit of affinity there and during their late-night convo so I'm really proud of SY boldly confessing her interest. Even if it doesn't go anywhere it's nice seeing women on the show express themselves without regret. I'm honestly rooting for both these girls, SR will have a tough choice!",

I\u2019m still unsure about HJ. \n\nFor the guys, maybe only JH and YH are love? \n\nI\u2019ve not watched the previous seasons. Was the ratio of money to love catchers quite balanced? I know they can change their identities, but do many do it? Or is it likely the producers already planned and cast people to make the chance of winning quite low?\n\nI\u2019m hoping SJ and YH will pick each other! She seems genuinely innocent and YH is so awkward that he suits her because he won\u2019t take advantage of her. His jokes are so cringey but she actually made a similar joke! lol. I really hope YH actually takes SB\u2019s \u201cadvice\u201d and be more active. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll get the girl if he keeps giving way to other guys!",

To me, SJ is the hardest person to read, she says one thing but than does another and seems so worried about money vs love, which makes me think she is money, but she may just be indecisive. \n\nAgree with YH and JH being love, the other guys seems fishy. I really liked SJ and YH at first, but now I\u2019m starting to feel bad for him, SJ is super hard to read so I get why he is hesitant to approach her. I\u2019m curious about YH x HJ and how they will vibe since we haven\u2019t seen them together that much! Also, I thought that book scene was cute!! \n\nI didn\u2019t watch the last season, but I heard there were a lot of complaints that there were too many money catchers, so hopeful this season it is more proportionate! I know in the 2nd season there was a girl who was originally money but changed to love and her and that guy are still together, so it has happened before!",

But SJ seems to be really considering their compatibility (like counting the age difference between her and YH, asking his job again even when his turn is over, considering between looks or chemistry). In this week\u2019s girls chat she also said she relates to TE and agrees that she should just go with her heart. \n\nFor HJ, I\u2019m just undecided. She doesn\u2019t give me money vibes but I don\u2019t have a good explanation yet on why she must be love. I\u2019ll need to observe her a bit more! Can you share why you\u2019re sure she\u2019s a love? \n\nI think YH\u2019s hesitation to approach SJ is not because he can\u2019t read her, but rather he is always giving too much consideration to SB. Like he didn\u2019t want to steal SB\u2019s seat next to SJ, and didn\u2019t want to be in the middle of their beer drinking session. SJ could be confused by his actions. He\u2019s always moving away, going away to get a book when she invites him to sit next to her, picking someone else for photoshoot when he had the choice of all the girls. \n\nI\u2019m also curious about how YH and HJ will develop! I wonder how he will behave if someone is pursuing him instead haha. Hope he doesn\u2019t crack bad jokes and chase HJ away!",

Check the reddit threads here on /r/koreanvariety, /r/KDRAMA, /r/CDrama, et cetera to find which ones are considered good by the people in the community.\n\nIf you also go on MyDramaList (to find the native/original name of the show, or like know the many alternate English names of the show you want to watch) and check the comments, usually people will link the Twitter/Bilibili/etc. posts on where to find it and like the social media stuff of the housemates.\n\nDon't forget to search using the Korean name, for Love Catcher it's \ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98.\n\n---\n\nLove Catchers and Money Catchers are not balanced. People don't really change. Producers probably let them free reign on the choice but ya sometimes they will cast people that are clearly going to be probably only money catcher or only love catcher.\n\nIt's kinda spoilers already to speak about it, but make sure to watch the earlier seasons chronologically so that you can see how the systems/activities/etc. of the show change. \n\nSeason 2 of Love Catcher in particular is considered legendary.\n\nThis a list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iyso9ql/",

And then Jeonghyeon ordering Yoonsuro to fix his stuff right as when Yoonsuro is about to answer Seungyeon. This has to be producer-influenced, scripted, staged. It's crazy. \n\nLike wtf, idgaf though, it's some timing that makes you so frustrated. Holy fml fam, I was like legit rooting for Seungyeon because ya she seems left out, and yo wtf. Jeonghyeon really just had to come at that moment, is the edit or sequence of events write? Why do PDnims/writers/etc. do this to us, this agony is not good. Give us cliffhangers to make us tune it for the next episode, but don't shatter plotlines just like that, as soon as it starts. Come on, bro, producers really had everyone's hopes up.\n\nAt least we finally confirmed that obviously the sensitive guy (Yongho) is like 90% not going to be a money catcher. It's a toss up either way as you never know how people act. What if he was given the option to be a money catcher though. Sigh.",

I still stand by that statement.\n\n...but I'm totally with you.  I'd love nothing better than a [Something in the Rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_in_the_Rain) scenario.  They *do* look really good together.\n\nThe only way to top the S2 [SRJ couple's](https://www.youtube.com/@srjjcouple) last-minute \"flip\" from MC-&gt;LC to create a LC/LC pair would be for TE-SR to *both* be MC right now, and have *both* flip to LC at the end.  That would be legendary!\n\nThe other way the TE-SR couple would be historic would be for them both to be MC right now, and TE convinces SR that's she's actually a LC, and then seduces him into flipping to LC.  Then, at the final reveal, the PD team springs the fact that despite acting all sweet talk and heart-fluttering moments, TE has been a MC the whole time, making her the most villainous player in Love Catcher history...I can imagine the ending montage, like [The Usual Suspects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Usual_Suspects), where they show TE's deception throughout the entire show, and then TE cackling like the Joker as she picks up the 50K briefcase and walks into the sunset.

SY might be a money catcher that will switch to love we shall see....  \n\n\ni love tae eun adn soo ro too i was rooting for them in the beginning but i feel their age gap wouldn't last that long in the real world, idk lots to think about, an 8 year age diff is rlly big esp when it's someone from early 20s compared to early 30s...so rn i'm rooting for SY and TE to get their happy endings cause both are my fav girls i hate rooting for underdogs...also SY's and YJ's friendship is so cute, the way they're each others wing women was adorable, if anything i'm glad these girls will be close even after leaving bali",

Since Yong Ho revealed he's actually there as a love catcher, that means seung beom is a money catcher as he talked to soo ji that night anonymously. During that convo he said he thought she was also a money catcher, but it was never confirmed. Knowing that two people can't both be money catchers, Seung beom probably found that soo ji may actually be in it for love and actually pure hearted, so he would feel bad for leading her on and eventually taking the money. But Yong ho is making him irritated because Sung Beom is the money catcher, yet Yong Ho is so unconfident and non assertive that Seung Beom wants him to step up to the plate with Soo Ji. That's why he said those things about \"Just because I'm talking to her doesn't mean you can't too\"  to provoke Yong Ho and try to get him to be more aggressive with Soo Ji so they can be together. Soo ji seems to like assertive men like Seung Beom but Yong Ho is being very passive despite the fact that he's the one whos a love catcher.",

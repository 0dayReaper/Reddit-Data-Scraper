The fun of the show depends on the situation that the casts were placed into. I usually watched the first episode and if I like it and I like the vibe and the casts, I'll finish watching the show. For example, in 3 meals a day: fishing village, they have to catch fish in order for them to be able to eat thrice a day. Basically, they have to provide for their own food and cook it themselves in that location to be able to feed themselves. The staff sometimes gave some tasks such as catch specific fish and they'll give a reward if they were able to catch it. While some cooking shows are like simulation of managing a food business so it gives viewers something to ponder on if they wanted to venture in the food business such as cafes/restaurant. It isn't exactly a real full simulation but you get to watch as a viewer how everything works in the back and front of the house. Some cooking shows are like a spice of life eg. some few seasons of 3 meals a day. It's also interesting to see things that they do when sidetracked from cooking/boredom and a glimpse of their personality for me.",

But then, even when I was a kid, I like to watch cooking shows. I mostly watch these kind of shows for what it offers and not because of the celebrities featured. Some watch shows/episodes because their fave idols/celebrities was featured. Though it's a fun way to discover celebrities/idols' past works through these shows if I like their personalities. \ud83d\ude09",

Currently only 3 seasons.  \n\n\nBusted: Interesting concept and high production, being funded by Netflix\n\nRunning Man: A bit more basic variety but has 12 years of content so you have content forever, i recommend watching clips and compilations on yt and then picking episodes based on the clips that look interesting. Or if you want to start linearly the OG cast is great to start with or you can start from the start of the current cast in 2017.",

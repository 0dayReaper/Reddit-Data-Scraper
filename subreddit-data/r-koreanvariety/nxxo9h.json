(s o that it doesn't seem that sthg is missing) etc etc\n\n******************************\nI can understand if people say that they are fans of seungi and his dynamics with this group and would like to see him back on this show..\n\nwhat i have an issue with is when people force that idea as some sort of thing he MUST do.. because he doesn't need to.. not for himself or for others.. and neither do other cast members MUST have him for themselves, for the show, or for himself..\n\nSeungi has grown, and his ambitions are also fairly clear.. i honestly don't see him doing anything which he is not headlining",

He didn\u2019t take into consideration that Soyeon was initially interested in Seehoon, and settled for Jin Taek once she realized Seehoon was interested in Jiyeon.\n\nRemember Soyeon didn\u2019t write to Jin Taek but Seehoon first. I think that once she realized Jin Taek was paying extra attention to her she kind of decided to give him a shot. She also figured choosing him would be her best chance to go to Paradise.\n\nAfter they returned it seemed like she was just mot that interested. Considering she mentioned she wasn\u2019t into younger guys, maybe he thought she just wasn\u2019t that into him. She didn\u2019t make any moves or any real effort to hang with him. So I think that bothered him and to get a reaction from her, he played his cards right.\n\nI believe that he did choose Jiyeon because he wanted to go back to paradise again and couldn\u2019t pick Soyeon twice.  He also figured neither Jia nor Yewon would pick him either way and his best chances were with Jiyeon.  I don\u2019t think he was particularly interested in her during their stay.  It seemed like he was his usual player self and also was trying to make her feel at ease since they had barely spoken to one another. \n\nIt\u2019s very telling that Jiyeon says they haven\u2019t really had any moments alone since they returned from paradise.  If he actually was interested in Jiyeon, he would\u2019ve pursued her more. I don\u2019t think he would be considerate of Sehoon if he really really liked Jiyeon. I think he was using her to make Soyeon jealous and it worked.\n\nSoyeon is using Jin Taek and Jin Taek is using Jiyeon. Both for the same reasons.",

He's definitely way more attractive than the average guy, but when he gets put on an island full of other Adonis looking men, it's harder to stand out obviously and your flaws become more apparent. And now Jiyeon is bringing his downfall on this show...  I'm not surprised that the new women are attracted to him, because technically he is a very attractive guy. But his prideful moments and his fixation and romanticization and putting Jiyeon on a pedestal do make him look pretty bad on screen.",

Everyone know that Jiyeon has no interest in him but he keeps chasing after her.\nI kinda felt bad for him but now?

He definitely has chosen the path of a villain though lmao. I feel really bad for Jiyeon, but I can't wait to see their reactions next week.\n\nI'm currently hooked on this show and I have to say I agree with most people praising Yaewon. She is genuine, charming, cute, and has the best body. Only thing is she is a bit on the shorter side, which is why she might not be as noticed. But she deserves more than just being the poster body! I'm also rooting for her and the new guy!! \n\nI love Jia and have been following her since before the show, and she doesn't really show her personality in this much. She's actually very talkative and funny on her YouTube channel but she said she's shy around new people so I guess that explains why. I love her IDGAF attitude though and she plays the game really well haha. I love how she lures in all the men without much effort. This girl was born to be a queen.\n\nSoyeon, I honestly liked her in the beginning because she had that genuine, easygoing, confident kinda vibes but as the episodes progress her personality is proving to be the opposite. I agree with other observations saying how she actually has pretty low self-confidence, and is not honest at times with her intent. I wouldn't go as far to say she is manipulative, but she definitely isn't being the most honest at times to save her face. I wish now that she confirmed Sehun and Jintaeks feelings, she would take a step back and be more honest with her feelings. \n\nThe men on this show kinda bore me tbh aside from Sehun but that guy is just pure chaos lmao. But I'm getting good vibes from this new guy so we'll see. I was also a bit disappointed when he picked Jia (although, who can resist?) but I hope he gives Yaewon a chance too. Pretty sure Jia-Hyunjoong and Soyeon-Jintaek are confirmed picks so I'm curious to see how the rest unfold.",

Sehoon had a very good point when he mentioned she was making a bigger deal out of the 1st day note than it actually was...I felt some 2nd hand embarrassment when she kept harping on it because like well...note or not, he has made it clear he has always been into ji yeon, not her :(  \n\n\nAlso, I think Soyeon needs to play the game a little better. For the excellent communicator that she is, she really is playing quite badly with her tactics. She fumbled the bag with JinTaek and now Sehoon. Eep. I think Jintaek is starting to realize he is just a rebound, so i'll be quite pleased if he moves on with Jiyeon since she likes him too :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJia's flirty games were fun to watch initially but now i'm kinda tired of it lol like just tell hyeonjoong if u want him or not, and stop trying to divert your attention to hyunseung...I feel bad for hyeonjoong because he has made it clear he is also loyal and one-woman-man hahaha. \n\nThat said, just wanna end on 1 note - **YEA WON BEST GIRL**",

I follow a Facebook group in my country about dating shows and the girls there are fangirling so hard over Sehoon. What I took as red flags, they thought was romantic. They\u2019re cheering Sehoon on for his decision to force JY\u2019s hands over the Paradise date and hoping she will fall for him \ud83d\ude31. I read on the Single\u2019s Inferno sub that &gt;!there is an article spoiling that JY will actually fall for him!&lt; which is once again just straight up Stockholm Syndrome. They\u2019re also of younger age and probably have never experienced over obsessive or controlling men besides those romanticized in TV shows. Trust me I\u2019ve seen this happened to my friends of all ages and it\u2019s not fun or safe to be around these men.",

            "comment": "Does anyone else find it interesting observing Sehoon in terms of just observing human behaviour and tendencies?\n\nThe addition of the two new girls made things a bit more interesting for me because we see how charming a person can be when they're just kind of interested (through the interactions between Sehoon and Sumin, and Sehoon and Minji), and then when you mix in a strong desire and ego (not being able to take rejection), you have the case of Sehoon and Jiyeon. One exhibits all these toxic traits and comes off like a whole different person.\n\nKind of makes you wonder. Maybe we don't usually end up with the ones we are the most attracted to because a lot of people are probably like Sehoon in one way or another when desire, ego, and pride takes centre stage and brings out a toxic side of you and puts that person off.\n\nThe lesson I'm kind of taking from this is you don't necessarily want to be so attracted to someone. Just being kind of interested can be a good thing. Never know, it could blossom into something beautiful if you just give it a try.",

            "comment": "I can see why HS chose Jia over Yaewon. It is apparent that these guys are competitive and like a challenge, but Yaewon wasn\u2019t that. She was practically throwing herself at HS and although I thought it was a cute interaction (I love Yaewon for being so open and funny; I love her personality), it was still transparent. But with Jia, there has always been this sense of mystery. And when you combine this with her ability to \u201clure\u201d men in, then I can see why HS chose her. If Yaewon is proactive in flirting, I think Jia is reactive. She waits to hear what the guy is going to say, or she asks the right questions (which she knows she will get the response she wants since she knows guys are into her), and then she ego-boost them by saying a comment that she knows these simple guys will eat up.\n\nOne thing on my mind regarding Yaewon is that she basically dropped Junsik but no one is talking about it? I mean she has every right to explore her options like everyone else but when other people did the same, they were given heat? I just thought it was was an interesting point.\n\nI\u2019m also wondering if Jiyeon is slowly into Sehoon now? She said she wants to talk to him but wants to wait until he gets back from Paradise to not make it seem like she is talking to him to get to Paradise. But if she finally wanted to tell Sehoon that she isn\u2019t interested at this talk, then how would that sway his decision to choose her for Paradise? So the other option that I\u2019m currently thinking is that she is opening up to him. But with that being said, I wonder why she is and if it is truly related to Jintaek taking his eyes off her. Also in ep 4 Yaewon asked Jiyeon if she is 100% not interested in Sehoon and she said not necessarily, she just wasn\u2019t attracted to him at the moment. But perhaps things have changed?\n\nLastly with Sehoon/Soyeon, in ep 4 Yaewon told Soyeon to try and pursue Sehoon since he is in a vulnerable state and could possibly be swayed, but it clearly ended up biting her in the butt. Sehoon was already coming to the realization about Jiyeon when he was talking with HJ in the beginning of the ep, but his talk with Soyeon wasn\u2019t just her giving advice to him. It was also paired with her confession to him, which he didn\u2019t like given the context (Jintaek going to Paradise with Jiyeon). To him it felt insincere and opportunistic since he was in a turbulent state.",

            "comment": "EP 5\n\nI have a feeling Jia's going to go for the new guy (Hyeonsong) It's funny how the 3 know each other. I sense a love triangle coming. I really like Sumin! She's got a really sweet, bubbly personality. Really hoping she doesn't turn out to be evil.\n\nI feel like Soyeon's really obsessed with the fact that Jintaek said he liked her on the FIRST day. It's quite obvious that people's feelings will change after you get to know them better. That conversation seemed like Jintaek lost interest in her.\n\nEP 6\n\nSoyeon and Jintaek are back to spending lots of time together? Maybe after that conversation they grew a lot closer.\n\nWow Sehoon is a lot stronger physically than he looks. I expected Hyeonjoong, Hyeonsong and Junsik to be the 3 to go to paradise so I was quite surprised. Yewon is so beautiful, has a perfect body and cute personality. Are these guys blind?? How has no one chosen her yet? I was really hoping the &gt;!new guy would choose her after having so much chemistry but I guess not. And Sehoon chose Jiyeon???  They're so awkward together now and he chooses to spend time with her? I feel it's because he knows that Jiyeon has no choice but to go with him. !&lt;Guys really love to chase and find the people they can't have attractive. It's a bit selfish of him\n\nI hope Sihun and Junsik leave because they're not contributing anything new. We need new people!!",

I felt embarrassed for Soyeon when she told the girls that Sehoon likes her to have that clarified by Sehoon. Ouch. I do think Soyeon wasn\u2019t being sincere.. if I was Sehoon I would also think that she is only saying these things because things are on the rocks with Jin Taek. But he was really aggressive in how he approached it with Soyeon which was uncalled for. \n\nSehoon decision to take Jiyeon.. just blows my mind. \n\nYeawon not being chosen, man, new guy doesn\u2019t know what he is missing out on. \n\nHaving said that, I continue to love the panelists, Kyuhyun\u2019s reactions are gold!",

            "comment": "I didn't really see a problem with how Soyeon was communicating this week until I read this thread. I thought she did very well in communicating her thoughts and feelings to others. I totally related to her because it seem as though she  was externally processing her feelings, and that's why you see her talking to so many people this last two episodes. As someone who also processes externally, a lot of times I have to voice what I'm feeling and receive feedback in order to know whether that feeling was correct or not. It seem to me like that was what Soyeon was also doing, she didn't have everything in order until she talked it out with people and once things started making sense to her then she took action. I think she was trying to look out for people while at the same time trying to navigate her own feelings in such a short amount of time. Soyeon says what is on her mind even if she doesn't have everything figured out and is figuring things out as each conversation progresses, but I guess it does seem wishy-washy to some people. With the conversation with Sehoon I get why she told him that she initially liked him after telling him to give up on Jiyeon. She even said in the show that she mentioned that she liked him because she felt bad for telling him to move on because he seemed so depressed. To me it was a spur of the moment thing because perhaps she planned on telling him about Jiyeon that day and telling him that she liked him at another time, but with seeing his reaction after she told him to back off of Jiyeon she wanted to cheer him up by saying don't be too bummed out because I like you. Imo, it's in her character to try to cheer him up like that after such a heavy advice.",

            "comment": "Soyeon really started to annoy me in ep.5. Jintaek set himself up when he made her feel as if she was his only interest and when he said she was the only one he\u2019d go to paradise with. But at the end of the day it\u2019s a dating show and Soyeon harped on that for wayyyy too long, all the different conversations they showed her having with anyone who\u2019d listen just got so tiring. Especially considering she was questioning him so hard on picking Jiyeon, but she also picked someone she had been interested in (Sehoon). So it seems they did the exact same thing ie. picking someone they would want to go with but with the expectation/belief that the other person probably wasn\u2019t going to pick them. She was just coming off way too intense about all that. \n\nSehoon is also someone who\u2019s really becoming weird and unlikable. I understood his point about how it came off shady for Soyeon to sit him down and tell him Jiyeon doesn\u2019t like him then go into how she\u2019s interested in him, but he still did too much in their last convo. And him picking Jiyeon is just soooo weird like dude she has shown time and time again she\u2019s not interested. Using this opportunity where she has no option but to spend a night with him to essentially corner her is really creepy.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve been really embarrassed for Sihun in regards to him liking Jia. Idk how these men can\u2019t see through her \ud83d\ude2d I don\u2019t dislike her at all, but it\u2019s quite clear she mostly just enjoys flirting and having them on the hook. And it was especially clear with Sihun. But she\u2019s good at what she does I guess or the guys are just dumb and shallow or both.",

And now in this show, the people with the best physical features are being rewarded on this show rather than valuing other aspects of a person. And idk, it's really starting to rub me the wrong way when people mention 'what they're looking for' or 'what they find charming', the first thing people will mention is physical features they like in a person instead of mentioning personality traits. Like Minji saying she likes people with nice noses or Sehoon liking Jiyeon right away because of her pure appearance. Idk... it feels pretty superficial to me. It's important to be physically attracted to someone but... for a long-lasting meaningful relationship, there are other things that matter way more like being able to communicate or having patience...\n\nEVERYONE is already good-looking on this show, no matter who you chose you'll walk away with someone who's more attractive than the average person. I wish people would focus more on personality traits first.... but I guess in their defense they do have really limited time to get to know each other so... physical features are the only thing to go off of right away.\n\nAlso I don't like how this show really emphasizes gender roles... like men should be big, manly and strong. And attractive women are petite, cute, and feminine. I'd rather see more characters that reflect a wider spectrum... but I mean this is a reality tv dating show so what do you expect...",

            "comment": "I liked Soyeon before but tbh I felt so much second hand embarrassment from her these few episodes. She really didn't have to be so upset about Jin Taek's date with Jiyeon. I think she is really anxious about ending up alone. She tried to play off her jealousy about JinTaek's date with Jiyeon as if she was worried about him looking like a liar or feeling guilty and him denying it made me cringe too.\nI think getting two notes at the start set her up. Now she expects multiple people to really like her but she is also not ready to show interest till others do it first. Idk if I should analyze her based on this edited show. But the thing is since she is tan, older than most contestants and athletic, her pool of choice was always going to be pretty small when it is a bunch of people who obviously care a lot of their and by extension other people's looks than anything else. And it is hard when the only person whose type is someone like her is not her type. \nThe way she kept telling everyone about how Sehoon chose her on the first day was also kind of embarrassing ngl. But it does seem like she actually likes Jin Taek but her pride was hurt too when he went for Jiyeon. She should instead be open with her feelings instead of holding back because of her insecurities. I also think she might think that Sehoon is older because he seemed more mature in the first episode and that's why she wants to go after him. Anyways the only people who actually give positive vibes in this show are Sumin and Yeawon. Everyone else seems petty.",

Like its exhausting to have to listen to their feelings everyday x3 if I'm honest, (I'm sure it is for her too). \n\nSoyeon seems to be trying a lot harder when it comes to Jin Taek which is nice to see, they seem to be glued to the hip which is so cute. \n\n I could barely watch through the brute strength challenge in the mud pit it seemed kind of cruel, but I did enjoy seeing Sehoon and HyunSeung kick ass. \n\nI don't know why HyunSeung would give us hope by considering Yeawon when he was going to pick Jia anyway. I don't understand why he did that either, because Yeawon and him had a lot more chemistry in 2 minutes than him and Jia did on the whole yacht ride. Also Yeawon actually had a interesting personality to play off of with HyunSeung whereas Junsik just feels like she's talking to a robot with pre-determined answers (although he was hilariously shooting lasers out of his eyes at HyunSeung when he mentioned Yeawon LOL). \n\nMinji was really cute to go hunt down Sumin and Sehoon IMO it seemed like she was feisty and was here to win. \n\nUltimate shock was the paradise picks. \n\nWe already saw HyunSeung and Jia go on a date why do I have to watch the same boring pair go to paradise together too? I think HyunSeung is playing it too safe by picking someone he kind of already knows. However, I have to give it to Jia she looked super chilled and relaxed when everyone was considering Yeawon would take her spot instead, even though we all know HyunSeung is her ideal type. \n\nI was almost going to start liking Sehoon this episode until he picked Jiyeon for paradise. Now he's giving major creepy weirdo vibes. He can't take no for an answer... Jiyeon isn't going to change her mind if she's already rejected you for the last 5 days.",

I think Jia makes all her decisions based on attraction because she probably doesn\u2019t see this being a long term thing. I feel bad for Hyeonjoong who seems to be a bit more serious about Jia (at least, it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s lusting after her) and is just more of a shy, reserved kind of guy. I think Hyunseung should\u2019ve picked Yeawon. He already knew Jia and he already picked her for one date. However, I think he probably thought Jia wanted to go to paradise and didn\u2019t want to ruin his chances with her, whereas Yeawon would probably take him going to paradise with Jia as expected. He did say unless something big happened he would be going after one person. One conversation probably just wasn\u2019t enough to sway him completely.",

            "comment": "At the end of the day, this is a Korean dating show and we have to remember that. Their culture is very much reflected in everything: personality, looks, preference, etc. Like picking someone because of their pretty nose? Most of us wouldn\u2019t get that but none of them even blink at it.\n\nHonestly, everyone has good qualities. Even the guys. All six guys are sweet in their own way and face palm in other ways. \n\nSehoon said it himself, he has never been rejected before so this is mind blowing to him/his pride so he can\u2019t let it go. My hope he and Jiyeon just completely clear the air. She has never told him directly she isn\u2019t interested. Not that it excuses him making her uncomfortable. He needs to hear it, let it go, everyone moves on. \n\nJiyeon seems pretty miserable on the island, feel bad for her. \n\nSoyeon is very likable and relatable but I can see when someone else said she is also insecure and seems to be dwelling in her uncertainty. She didn\u2019t like Jintaek but she likes that he likes her and doesn\u2019t like his attention going elsewhere. Had she invited him to that lunch, he probably would have completely stuck with her, but she didn\u2019t so what was he supposed to do but keep doing what he is on the island to do? He still kept looking to her after too. She\u2019s probably the oldest female but a lot which is hard too in this setting. It\u2019s weird she likes Sehoon so much when he seems so mismatched for her. She probably wouldn\u2019t mind if Hyunseung picked her. No judgement at all for this. She just seems to need love. I love how expressive and clear/straight up she is. \n\nJia - I honestly really like her. She is confident and beautiful and shouldn\u2019t be blamed for that. She hasn\u2019t done anything bad and seems naturally cool/mysterious and her allure is real. It does seem a burden to be so desired. I think she also understands this is likely a short term thing so she\u2019s being careful about getting the guys too caught up. It doesn\u2019t seem like she really actually liked anyone that much until Hyunseung showed up. \n\nHyunseung is my favorite of the guys. He is definitely a hottie and seems to have a good personality overall.\n\nSiHun - He has good qualities and is being understanding and respectful to Jia, as she said, but he definitely seems miserable. I also don\u2019t love his look. Cultural difference here. Not into what they call the \u201cidol look\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s funny how it\u2019s all going. It feels like a social experiment in that men go after what is generally the most desirable kind of no matter what. For one, they have better chemistry with someone else? Doesn\u2019t matter. For another, multiple other girls interested? Doesn\u2019t matter. Etc. \n\nMy favorite possible pairings are Hyunseung and Yaewon. Cheering for Yaewon but I also get the appeal of Hyunseung and Jia.",

She could have just told SiHun outright that she wasn't interested, but she chose to lead him on... it's not nice, even jiyeon outrightly rejected Sehoon. I swear if any dude did what she is currently doing, they would be condemned already (aka the JinTaek hate from earlier episodes).\n\nSehoon bro, you had a redemption arc going there (2 new girls vying for your attention etc) and &gt;!YOU WASTED IT.!&lt;",

                    "comment": "I mean it's not like I don't think Jia isn't meticulously playing all of them but the difference from an audience perspective is that Jia never 'picked' any of them explicitly, she just unsubtlely suggested she was interested in each one of the boys. When Jia was asked who she liked best before the new guy came, she said she decided she was only really into one guy, so all you could have gotten out of that was that she finally decided. Before that though, she basically told both of them that she was exploring her options. Whenever she compares either of them to one another, she was very particular to use what Sihun probably considered flaws in her relationship with HJ as what made her more interested in HJ, which covers her bases on the fact that she never explicitly said that's what made Sihun a better option than HJ - those were just the differences she saw in them.\n\nThen, when she talked to Sihun after the new guy came into the picture, she told him she's interested in two guys now, but she used body lanaguage to suggest that she wasn't including Sihun; ie. She almost refused to look at him, she kept herself distant from him, she just barely comforted him when he got upset about feeling like his feelings were unreciprocated. Jia almost rarely ever says anything outright; she has a very politician/media savvy way of navigating the relationships on this show. But that's also what makes her a better player than JinTaek, who almost explicitly told Soyeon that he wouldn't go for anyone else, and then began telling Ji Yeon almost the exact same thing in Paradise. Ji Yeon took interest, then So Yeon kind of guilted him into being closer with her, and so he subsequently started ignoring Ji Yeon. In contrast, Jia kept getting HJ's approval to see other people almost unprompted, so she was kind of like 'yeah okay sure,' and Sihun basically did the same with the whole 'that's okay you can go with HJ I can wait.' So the difference is that Jia never actively flip flopped about her desires except, to an extent, when the new boy came, whereas JinTaek did the moment he was given the chance to.",

And, looking at how sneaky and tactical HyunSeung is, he may just be having a superficial friendship with HyonJung and using him, while HyeonJung thinks that it is a genuine friendship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr, maybe they both talked while they were swimming in the ocean and agreed that they will do whatever is best for content. And having two friends fighting over a girl is good for content and puts the spotlight on both of them. HyeonJung may not even really care about Ji-A and may just be in it for the exposure. The same thing with Ji-A and HyunSeung, they are probably in it only for the exposure.",

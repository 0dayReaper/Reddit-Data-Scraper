    "postText": "Hi guys, \nSo this question has been confounding me for years.\nThe variety shows i watch are SMTM (and it's neighbours) and Gentleman's league. \nGentlemen's league is where the majority of my questions arise.\nSo I understand if a clothing company hasn't sponsored a show, or another one had their logos will be taped over. \nHowever on Gentleman's league (let's call it GL for now) the entire teams tracksuits are one brand, Lonsdale. Since the entire team wears the same outfits I'm guess Lonsdale paid for this however their logo is 80% of the time covered up. That being said there are entire episodes where it isn't and is prominently featured. What in the world is the reason for this? \nSMTM also has this, for a few seasons they were sponsored by Adidas, many contestants wore Adidas but sometimes the Adidas logo was half taped over and other random brands like Stone Island etc. We're shown.\nMy Korean family have no a answers for this and ask me to chill , I'm hoping someone on here may be able to shed some light!",

You can sponsor a show but it would be a mini ad within the show ( not like Chinese shows ).\n\n* PPL or sponsorship is allowed inside a show but for a limited time\n* clothing brands can sponsor for time limit or just just few people within an episode \n* outside variety shows wear a brand but they aren't sponsorship ( logo covered )",

            "comment": "Also just to add to the many responses already, brands might sponsor some episodes but not all and in cases where they want a specific uniform for the entire cast across multiple episodes, it\u2019s easier to just add tape over the logos and use the same clothes for the eps brands don\u2019t sponsor and just remove the tape for when they do sponsor. \n\nAlso in some cases, if you look in running man, most of the clothes the members wear from put together by their own stylists, are sponsored items, but they get the logos taped over bc the brands don\u2019t give money to the show/sponsor the show itself (bc technically only the members are sponsored). This is still great publicity for the brand even if the logo is covered up, it familiarizes the viewers with the items of clothes, and in many cases, stylists get these clothes rented to them for free. An example of this is on the yt show called Workman, there\u2019s an ep where they work as a stylist and explain one of the rental system for sponsored clothes.",

    "postText": "I laughed so much in this episode. As an introvert myself, I can relate so much to Chang sub. The constantly being aware of other people, and being shy to ask for help or say no to something. I was kinda shocked that in Korea they bring dogs to a kindergarten. I thought that was kind of excessive at first but then again they\u2019re probably busy so they need someone to care for the dogs. Additionally, the palm oil family episodes are always entertaining and fun to watch. I\u2019m look forward to the next episode with the demolition actor. I always like seeing actors who aren\u2019t that famous yet in the show because it shows that acting is not all giltz and glamour.",

Some of my friends don\u2019t get it and even feel bad for me, but I\u2019m the happiest when I can be in control and do whatever I want in my own time and space. Code Kunst commented at the end that no one can beat Changsub when it comes to happiness and I felt that\u2019s exactly what extreme introverts really are.",

As a fellow introvert, I prefer doing things by myself and only hang out with my dog. I totally understand what he meant when he explained that he\u2019ll perform and do crazy stuff on variety shows and whatnot because work is work, but otherwise, he\u2019s happy with small things and doesn\u2019t need or do much. I\u2019ll play along and can be very personable when needed, but you\u2019ll often find me doing things alone and never speaking to a single person.",

I also hate when store clerks give me attention when I'd rather shop in peace. \n\nI'm worried showing his everyday life might make fans go to his dog kindergarten and regular areas though. Hopefully Melodies aren't crazy like that\ud83d\ude2c",

Which I don't agree with at all.\n\nMaybe that's why they also sometimes say that certain people are an \uc778\uc2f8 (\"inssa\", short for \"insider\") or \uc544\uc2f8 (\"assa\", short for \"outsider\"). Being an insider is seen as positive and sociable while outsider is kind of like an antisocial, almost loser behaviour, or living under a rock. For example, Key, Narae, CoKun, will be considered \"insiders\".\n\nCopied the definition of both from the net:\n\"\uc778\uc2f8 is a type of person who gets along with people, knows almost everything related, and works/participates with passion within the group that they belong to.\uc544\uc2f8 is a type of person who loves being alone enjoying one\u2019s own world rather than trying to be involved in a group.\"",

I think as long as they spread it out (ie not every other episode) then it will continue to be entertaining. \nI also enjoyed Changsub\u2019s segment - how interesting that he is an introvert yet has such a publicly extroverted persona! I happened to watch the beginning of Kingdom recently and he is completely comfortable on the stage and in front of all the other groups as a sunbae. \nLooking forward to next week\u2019s ep!",

I don't have the guts to speak loudly and I feel bad for calling the waiter over haha. \n\nWhen he said that he just has to do it and be funny/extroverted because it's his job, I felt it. I can do that too but at the end of the day, I need my own space. And as Changsub said, he feels the most comfortable in his own space and he likes being alone.",

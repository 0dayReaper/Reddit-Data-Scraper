For example, I am interested in watching episode 113, but the episodes that have been subtitled skip from episode 99 to episode 117.",

If the guests don't have a large international fanbase, the episode (or the guest's segment) won't be subbed. And no one would casually fansub such a long-running show with variety of guests and topics.",

Same format as going to a village, yoo jae suk waking up everyone waiting with quizzes in the morning while everyone is sleepy. People who lose is responsible to cook and others can go back to sleep. But no treasure hunt. They play games, catch fishes, do chores and cook.",

It's not great, but not bad either.  I think they could have done more, though, had they thought it through and done more planning.  The premise was interesting, but the execution was lacking.",

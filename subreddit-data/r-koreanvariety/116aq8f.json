The main game consists of listening to a song and determining the correct lyrics for a part of it while employing different hints to get closer to the solution. Every failed attempt means more food for YouTube mukbang star Small-mouthed Haetnim. During Snack Time a different game each week determines who gets to try a snack representing this week's market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Host**\n\n* Boom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Shin Dong-yeop\n* Kim Dong-hyun\n* Moon Se-yoon\n* Park Narae\n* Hanhae\n* Key\n* Nucksal\n* Taeyeon\n* Haetnim\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Guests**\n\n* Kim Young Kwang\n* Lee Sung Kyung\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**One Shots**\n\n|Member|2023|Overall|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Key|1|95|\n|Seyoon|2 + 1|78 + 1|\n|Hanhae|3 + 1|50 + 1|\n|P.O\\*|0|56|\n|Hyeri\\*|0|49|\n|Nucksal|2|48|\n|Narae|1|40|\n|Taeyeon|1|21|\n|Shin Dongyeob|1|16|\n|Donghyun|0|15|\n|Haetnim|0|1|\n\n\\*\\*updated based on Wiki'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Subtitles**\n\n|**Stream**|Link|\n|:-|:-|\n|Streaming site|[Viu](https://www.viu.com/ott/ph/en-us/vod/2080080/Amazing-Saturday-2023)|\n\n**Source**\n\n\\*Viu\n\n^(\\*you can still support @/dareumi from all the subtitle works they had done for the community by donating through -)  [^(ko-fi.com/dareumi)](https://ko-fi.com/dareumi) \\+",

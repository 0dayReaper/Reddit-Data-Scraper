Plus getting to see true best friends crush &amp; zico being so comfortable w each other (transit love skit in the bathtub) can't be beat.  Jung Hoon's bad luck is making me root for him! He deserved higher on karaoke score.\n\n Are there any other comparable travel variety shows (even older ones) that ppl would recommend? TIA",

            "comment": "This episode turned out to be my favorite.  I also hate traveling to places with full of tourists,  so when they were describing how they haven't seen any people anywhere,it sounded like best place to visit.  Ultimate place to switch off when you are too stressed, beautiful scenery, good food ,what more do you need?\n\nAlso not very aware with discography of Crush, but his singing is impressive and taste in music is exactly my taste, when he picked 'everything happens to me' I was so happy. He said it reminds him of snow,for me (as someone who never seen snow) this song always reminds me of a rainy day. I always play this song when it's raining. \n\nNow for Choi Jung hoon, nothing is going his way, he looked genuinely hungry,the whole eating part was torture for both Lee youngjin and him.But he was in his elements in the karaoke room,amazing singer, so no idea why the song got the lowest score.  \n\nFinally when all of them were talking in the LP bar,and junghoon said that he really wants to take the same route and wants to come back again but couldn't think of anyone to come with, I totally felt that emotion, I also sighed while watching that part.\n\nAnd top it off, the disastrous quiz and what the fuck is pound show!!! An emotional parts balanced by utter silliness,loved the combination and ended the episode in a sweet taste.",

    "postText": "Does anyone know how to join the live audiences? I know during some shows that they have a live audience with citizens, but I'm not sure how one goes about applying for it. I've heard that it's on the broadcasting program's page, but so far I haven't been able to find any. I know some Korean, but it's still been difficult to navigate so would like any pointers on the matter would be helpful!\nSpecifically, I'm interested in Phantom Singer (JTBC) but frankly I'm not sure when the finale for this is/was filmed. I would also be interested in Immortal Songs or other competition shows who have a live audience in general that might be happening for the next two months.\nThanks for reading, please share any advice that you might have, it would be greatly appreciated.",

    "postText": "Source: https://www.instagram.com/p/CtFpY-qpyw4/  \n\\[+521\\] I haven't watched 'Hangout with Yoo' in a while because of Lee Mijoo..  \n\\[+578\\] The show became boring once it got blatantly obvious that Yoo Jae Suk is trying push the people behind his own line. He's been able to make it thus far thanks to the image he's built but I have to admit that he's hyping Lee Mijoo up more than the talent she's able to back it up with. She speaks informally to PDs and other people older than her and yells at them, which is crossing the line for me. She may be their cute little dongsaeng off camera or whatever but there's no reason us viewers should have to put up with that behavior on screen. Lee Mijoo originally rose to variety fame with her kind, sensitive image, and I think her character has veered off course from that. I'd rather she just go back to her singing career and focusing on that. The PD of this show is also a problem. He failed to clean up the table set by Kim Tae Ho PD and is just refilling side dishes upon side dishes instead of coming up with anything new. What is the point of these missions without any destination? It's obvious the current PD has no ideas of his own other than following whatever Kim Tae Ho PD has already set up.  \n\\[+321\\] Yoo Jae Suk bores me now... it's getting old  \n\\[+255\\] Viewer ratings won't recover unless they switch this show to Yoo Jae Suk solo. I haven't watched since they added Haha and Jung Jun Ha. It's so boring how he keeps pulling in members of his line and forcing screentime for them.   \n\\[+184\\] No one cares about this love line because the show keeps forcing it even when the two in question keep denying it..   \n\\[+163\\] Mijoo is so boring... I don't get why they hype her up so much  \n\\[+132\\] I don't know why we have to watch them go on dates on the show anyway?  \n\\[+125\\] Maybe I'm too old for these shows now but I don't get what the point of it is. Seems like it'd be better off with Yoo Jae Suk solo and hosting a guest once in a while, but as it is now, there's too much going on, and I really don't know what the point of it all is.   \n\\[+31\\] I was a big fan of Yoo Jae Suk... but after a while, it became obvious that his shows were more of a stage for him to bring his friends on and grab them more screentime. Why is he so desperate to make Lee Mijoo a thing? It's so blatant that it actually turns me off from Yoo Jae Suk completely... I think him looking out for others is coming back to bite him...",

            "comment": "So I haven't caught up on HDYP lately but I saw a video clip of part of the date and the episode before when they said they should have a date. While I do think they have chemistry and the \"are they dating?\" gag can be fun, I'll be honest, she has said enough times that they aren't and that she wouldn't that it really doesn't interest or entertain me anymore. The only way them pushing it this far and even having them go on a date would entertain me would be if it was revealed say at the end of the date that they are dating/BF-GF. Otherwise it just seems like a gag that has gone on too long that with one side of their mouth they downplay because people take it too seriously and then with the other side of their mouth they play into it because it used to be popular. \n\nIt was one thing when Mijoo was chronically single and thirsty on the Sixth Sense series when male guests came on the show but it's another thing when she and the guy she is love-lining are fixed cast members on a show for months upon months. At first it was fun and cute but once it got to the point they started denying it and playing it down when guesting on other shows so people knew it was all for show, then it needed to die off. IMO.",

While I also find HDYP very boring lately and Mijoo has definitely become less fun (in part due to the material she has to work with), any sane person who has watched and liked the show should conclude the show has simply outlived its peak. All super popular shows either finish off on highs or just change enough to stay a shadow of itself, which is fine. Expecting a show to stay fresh and interesting throughout so many iterations and years is ridiculous. If you don't want the show to end but do want it to change, then give them constructive comments and let them figure it out. If they come back better, great, and if it doesn't work out, then they'll naturally dissolve the show. All this blaming on individuals is so counterproductive and mean for no reason. I feel bad for both the members who are shat on and for those who aren't and have to deal with this shit anyways. \n\nHDYP desperately needs the upcoming break and hopefully their new PDs can come forward and take back control of this situation with a firm hand. If it gets even worse than this, I fear Yikyung, Jinjoo and Mijoo tbh might just quit and call it there and whoever has to \"replace\" them will have a rough time with the fallout. Haha will just follow YJS and if it gets bad enough, I can see them doing maybe one more season and then disbanding it since there are many other platforms they've been experimenting on that has proven to be more of a success and doesn't have the restrictions proper channel variety shows do.",

HDYP has poor ratings but high exposure. The fact that people are bothering to criticize means that there is still interest in the show. None of those three are going to quit unless MBC fires them. If those three are fired, Haha will also be removed as well.\n\nThe current cast is not in any immediate danger though because MBC is more focused on ensuring that the production team improves. They really dropped the ball on the previous PD. I'm assuming he wanted to get famous and got the position through some sort of connections.\n\nAnd the reason MBC is willing to experiment with all these changes is because they know they have the option of returning to a solo YJS format, which is what viewers have been asking for since the new changes were announced. HDYP is far from dead yet.\n\n&gt;If you don't want the show to end but do want it to change, then give them constructive comments and let them figure it out\n\nMy response is getting a bit long but I want to add that viewers have been trying to give constructive feedback for a while. It falls on deaf ears. The production team and the members, including YJS, have deliberately ignored viewer concerns. So while you're correct that constructive criticism would generally be better, it hasn't worked in this case. Perhaps that is why the audience has shifted to more volatile, personal attacks.",

While the cast isn't actually in trouble rn of being fired and ofc YJS still has plenty of power, you have to think about the risk v reward. It's not dire yet but at what point is it still worth it for the cast members to continue the show if the viewers detest them? YJS has enough staying power and though he might get some short term flak, he's gonna be fine but the idea of him returning to HDYP alone despite ALL of his other projects taking its toll on him, and knowing his friends and colleagues will have to be let go in this manner, I just don't see him going for that.\n\nAlso, the show, with its current reported cast, could continue for longer but if it loses all its goodwill here, then the audience will be put off and most of them might simply not want to continue. If the show casts super popular guests and come back with a short term project that has been guaranteed to get some attention (like the music projects) then sure, they might cobble together some decent ratings, but the long-term outlook would still be bad. I agree about your point on the constructive criticism and why the audience is up in arms as a result of how much the staff has neglected to at least appear to listen to them, but some of the netizens firing back at the individual cast members is just wrong. If I was Mijoo, other than feeling bad that I'm getting so much hate, I'd feel some resentment for the staff for letting it get to this point and not doing damage control earlier.\n\nLastly, I want to make it a point in case this reply came off too negative that I actually agree with most of your thoughts. The main point of contention I have is that while the cast is popular, and YJS is one of the top celebs in SK, they're not susceptible to bad press and viewer outrage. If the staff doesn't do a better job with this break they've been given, there can only be so many chances MBC will give and the fatigue from the cast be overlooked.",

Who would voluntarily give up a reliable source of income unless they were leaving for something bigger? And for all three of the younger members, HDYP is their biggest and most relevant project. In the case of the two actors, both of them normally get casted in supporting roles. Even Haha, who has Running Man, wouldn't willingly give up extra income that's going to help raise his family.\n\nAnd being in the public eye is always preferable to disappearing from it. The new members have gotten criticism but they've also gotten CFs, new projects, and awards thanks to the show. They're getting exposure and that's what any celebrity wants. Working alongside YJS is an even greater boost. There are lines of people wanting to work with him.\n\nSo in general, I do agree with the points you're making. Viewer fatigue, cast fatigue, bad press...all of that is going to affect the future of the show. Your explanation actually has me thinking that perhaps the show is in a more dire state than I was previously assuming. But I still don't think the members would voluntarily step down, for the reasons I listed above. I'd be curious to hear your thoughts if you disagree though.",

The fact that Mijoo was funny in Jaeseok's YouTube content last month and that Yi Kyung was also very good in his recent Running Man appearance shows that the problem with this show is not with the cast but the producers and writers. I used to be a regular viewer of this show but then Kim Tae Ho left and the show is filled with Korean variety cliches and uninspiring items with a constant rehash of old concepts - particularly with singing. The main PD isn't funny but he constantly appears in the camera for no reason. I probably won't tune in to this show until the PD is gone.",

People can shine as guests and still end up performing poorly when they're casted as a permanent member. I'm not defending the producers nor am I saying that those two deserve to get criticism, but your logic doesn't make sense.",

I mean, think about the people who are going viral right now. People like Tanaka, Dex, and PSick Show have gotten their start online, not on variety shows.

If he doesn't bring his friends on the show that's actually named after him, where would he bring them? \n\nI don't really like the comparison of nepotism because YJS literally worked from the ground up to get where he is today. He's seen much worse than the variety stars and idols of today, so he wants to help people and give them the golden chance *he* longed for back then. If he decides to bestow a golden hand on a few people to lift them up, what's the problem in that? If he promoted people who were newbies, sure, but both Mijoo and Jessi were in the industry grinding for *years* (for Jessi's case decades) before they were promoted by YJS. Mijoo *is* funny, the other comments here prove that, but one weak show (and thus own weak performance) causes this pile of hate. \n\nSaying \"lack of skills\" is just too harsh. There's a reason YJS is promoting all these artists. Even a god tier MC like YJS has a ton of \"flopped\" shows, and if one of his line members has *one* weak performance, then it becomes a learning moment, not something to start saying \"nepotism\" on.",

Nobody is claiming YJS benefited from nepotism. They're saying he is engaging in nepotism. Nepotism is a person in power using that power to lift up people based on personal connections instead of merit.\n\nWhat is the line system? It's YJS using his power to lift up people around him.

I bet the JJH and haha wont be able to get in if they went through proper process, it\u2019s the fact based on performance.\n\nI am talking in general , there are many shows: YJS + LKS , YJS + haha , YJS + Seho, YJS + JSM in more than one show. I didn\u2019t see that pattern with other MCs in the same timeframe.\n\nYJS has so many advantages in this line culture too: He has already established the connection, so he can easily glide through new programs. More quantity of shows with less effort. Last but not least,control , he doesn\u2019t have to work hard or compete as they are just line numbers.\n\nI have been observing this pattern since last year, I think JJH and Haha are extreme cases of Nepotism that YJS had did of all shows. Whatever name might be given in this form of recommendation, but it\u2019s definitely not lifting talent.",

She just happens to be friends with him AFTER her success. She made it on her own from survival show. Jessi doesn\u2019t need Jae Suk to be funny, she was already known to be blunt and funny, has her own \uc388\uc5b8\ub2c8 character. Has a successful career as an artist. She hosted interviews alone just fine. She isn\u2019t appearing every time there\u2019s yoo jae suk. \n\nMijoo on the other hand, although I quite adore her, was struggling in her group &amp; still trying to find her own place in the industry. Got a lot of hate in variety shows, just got a solo debut. To people who don\u2019t really like her, probably feel forced &amp; the only reason she\u2019s everywhere is because of yjs. They might wanna see people who are funnier, not just there because of connection to a popular celebrity.",

His comedy style is old and out of date. thats why he can't gel with the rest of the cast. I think haha is fun to watch, but he brings too much comedy skits that he always pulls with yjs. its funny, but takes away spotlight from the rest of the cast. I actually liked mina the more i watched her. But they were killing her character with the shitty show writting. They could have talked more about how well she is doing with her dieting. its actually inspiring how much healthier she looks. Unlike Junha who look like he's one burger away from goin to the ER.  The other two, yikyung and jin joo deserves a chance, they are a breath of fresh air.\n\nTL:DR **YJS** \\- good, but his jokes feels very forced, **MiJoo** \\- IMO still at the top of the game, **HaHa** \\- OK, **Mina** \\- good, **Jun ha** \\- don't even invite him back as a guest.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone. Just wanted to ask some of you who are caught up on the show about a few things.\n\nI would appreciate it if people could respond in a way with minimal or without spoilers and I'll try to do the same. For reference I just finished episode 49 and up to the finale of the super league. For anyone reading from this point their will be obvious spoilers from ep 1-49.\n\n&gt;!So if it wasn't obvious i'm speaking in general about the casting of Jungeun to national family. I don't have any personal issue with Jungeun as a player or anything but just the general direction the show is going is starting to get a little stinky. From the beginning of Season 2 I felt my interest waning with the addition of the WW team. Adding so many markedly better players, let alone multiple on one team, kind of felt like it was killing the point of the show for me. The entire point of the show was \"growth\" as Lee Su-geun even says in the intro, but suddenly were adding players way above the skill level of others and with soccer experience. Not every team can get such a player either due to the concept restriction so the balance has just kinda left the building.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!As soon as the Super league started the problem became even worse and I found myself constantly fast forwarding the editing because it was obvious who was going to win. From Nat family's first game everyone knew who was gonna take the super league so it just became a slog to watch. Reading through a few old episode discussions it seems I'm definitely not the only one feeling that way. All that being said, I get it the PD's have a hard job with the \"concept\" restriction and the fact some teams have been playing for 1+ years now. I get it. I just don't see how pandora can go back in the box now that they've made such casting decisions. I guess I'm just posting here to see if the shows parity returns or not from those of you who are caught up.!&lt;",

I figured there would be some unintentional changes anyways considering how many celebrities are in the show and the likelihood that everyone returns was always gonna be low.\n\nWas just worried with the PD's direction mostly to be honest but if things improve than im all for it. Thanks for the info!",

That season with Lee JungEun as a player of Gukdae family was an anomaly, and an obvious attempt to put in a ringer in a team that was obiviously weak but a favorite of Korean audience. I hated it too, but now I can say that now, she jump-started a new mindset in all the players, all the coaches and all the teams. They started to take this show (the match itself) more seriously and dedicated themselves to self growth and improvement. Coaches started to be more strict with training, expectations and strategy to overcome weakness/strength of each teams.\n\nCurrently the skill-gaps are not to big, and each team has their own weakness and strength. The matches are becoming unpredictable each players contributed to the success or failure of the team. Even if a new addition was added to a team, she is expected to have the same mentality of improvement which are now are deeply rooted in all the players.\n\nYou should stick with it and see for yourself the growth and dedication of each players and teams.",

And he was right, the best thing about it is that instead of giving up, it ignited the competitive spirit in the rest of the league and gave them a goal to aim for, as everyone saw how cool she was. And all the players dedicated themselves to it, both the old and new players.\n\nThe recent matches have been very exciting and competitive and full of highlights from start to finish. In the early days they had to fill the episode with too many replays but now it's just highlight after highlight. And the level of play is much higher with actual team play and controlled passing. The improvements have been steady and very satisfying to watch.\n\nSo I would say the show has actually improved in terms of entertainment since those days",

            "comment": "First of all, So-So arent that good. You would be surprised once you reach recent episodes how different they were with current particulars players. Im WW fan, they were decent but only Sohee had strong workrate. It broke my heart when she left to commit her singing career. Cant imagine how strong the team would be if she stayed and play with new addition.\n\nJung Eun seemed amazing however, all she had was close control. She were unstoppable because every other players dont have strong basic. PD isnt former footballer, they could get consultation regarding casting but this is variety show, they just cast whoever they think can commit and would attract views. It was refreshing to see there was strong athletic korean female who has the talent in football despite having no actual experience. I think, she is one of the reason, many korean female starting playing futsal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;if the shows parity returns or not\n\nIt is to certain degree. It is hard to achieve since all other teams showed slow improvement. Real slow. So any addition with talent would cruising the pitch however some coach adapted well and can even produce unpredictable result. The senior teams mostly improved on physicality. Basic still far from being stable. Jung Eun was lucky, her opponent didnt have strong physical to basically remove her from the game. If she were to return next season, I dare say her impact isnt much if she didnt play a game after she left.",

All the girls casted after season 2 are pretty raw to the game but like doing exercise. The show currently is really balanced. And notably the girls are even more devoting to the show than previous seasons. It's pretty interesting to see their improvement",

    "postText": "I just started watching the first season of Heart Signal on Viki and I\u2019m really confused about the anonymous messages? I\u2019m on episode 4 now and they\u2019ve only been showing who sent messages to whom without actually including the message. They were more detailed in the first episode and included the messages sent too. Is there another version where they do include the messages? Or another website? I read on this subreddit that generally heart signal does show the messages.",

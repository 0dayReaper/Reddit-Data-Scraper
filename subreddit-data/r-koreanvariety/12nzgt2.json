It was kind of hard to search for posts like this without all of the 2D1N episode posts popping up haha\n\nSo, I'm going to be visiting Korea soon and need inspiration for places to visit / want to hype myself up! Does anyone have recommendations for variety shows (preferably newer or ongoing) that show off various places in Korea? Preferably with a lot in Seoul. I'm interested in popular/trendy spots and food. I'm not as interested in seeing rural or natural areas, but the occasional mountain or hiking spot can be fun if it's particularly popular or iconic.\n\nAlso, I am looking more for shows that highlight the location aspect as part of the episode itself. Something like Running Man wouldn't exactly fit the bill as from the episodes I've watched, they mostly just do games at the location and don't really highlight its key points.",

            "comment": "I think shows like Battle Trip might worked too! Because some of the episodes they actually introduced some location in Korea.\n\nYou can check the more recent eps (S2: 3 - 4 &amp; 14 - 15)\n\nYou can also check out Now, Follow Me. They did travel in Korea from ep 4 - 8. There might be some places that might interest you?\n\nOh yeah not sure if you are into surfing, but I know one of the show called 'Dragon Brothers' aired the cast members going to Yang Yang to surf. Seems like it's a quite famous place for surfer to go surfing as I know this place had been mentioned in other shows too. But I don't think the place is in Seoul.\n\nAlso you can check out Arirang TV. There are quite a number of travel shows introducing different places in Korea. One of the show is called [Travel Tracks](https://www.arirang.com/tv/157/archive/843)\n\nKBS World do have also their own travel shows where they also introduce Korea different locations. Examples are shows like [Guide Map, K-Road  ](https://kbsworld.kbs.co.kr/program/view.php?pg_seq=1136)",

            "comment": "I'm enjoying the show. Kian and Si Eon have their own unique dynamic and remind me of an old married couple. It's pretty clear that they both haven't traveled a ton and are definitely the types many would probably hate traveling with. At least in any situations where they are out of their comfort zones. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nKian is way too lax in the way he does things. If he doesn't understand the situation he just gets passive and let's the other party get their way even when he's getting ripped off. Si Eon is better prepared for travel in general but is such a great example of the stereotypical tourist that doesn't like unfamiliar tastes and repeats the same thing in a louder voice when he tries to communicate. It's funny to watch them since it feels real to who they are and how they really react in situations. I like how unscripted it seems compared to other shows. \ud83e\udd99\u2665\ufe0f",

He can defuse and make light of Kian's controversial words (if there's any) because he knows how Kian got so much flak for the simplest things when he started going on TV (when he got cancelled like every month lmao). Also, traveling is the best with people you're comfortable with, and fights are normal and could be fun to look back to. See how they are able to make fun of the fights in the studio.\n\nI keep thinking who else could they take that isn't too busy and not too popular that they'd get mobbed but I'm drawing blank atm",

There for the photos and Instagram shots but not there to soak in the local culture and comforts. Many tourists don't make extra effort to learn how to communicate in a local or common language too, like Si Eon. I found him quite funny to watch but would be very frustrated if I traveled with him or Kian, for different reasons.",

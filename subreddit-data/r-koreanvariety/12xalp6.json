It also makes sense to avoid going fusion with Pizza in the land of pizza. It would be verrrrrrrrrrrry different if they were in England, America or Canada and wanted to do Korean Pizza. But in Naples? The tourists want the \"authentic\" Naples pizza experience and the neighborhood locals are likely purists and have sticks up their asses about change. \n\nWatching that teaser for next week... excited for Yuri, bummed it appears like no more BamBam but definitely not anticipating watching snobbish Italians criticize traditional Korean food for BS reasons derived from their lack of being cultured and again, having sticks up their asses. \n\nI don't know that I'd choose what Paik has as the meal though. So many banchan options and not knowing the cultural procedure of how to eat them (what goes with what, why there are so many, etc) will scare off curious customers and confuse customers who try it. I think I'd recommend just sticking to simple KOR dishes; spicy pork with rice, hamar pajeon (local fresh squid, shrimp, mussels, oysters, clams, etc), spicy fish stew and such. Easy to eat, easy to understand and compatible with their palate with them using so many local ingredients (especially seafood).",

Each person will be given a chance to talk and interact with one participant of the opposite sex at a time, and if they don't feel like the conversation is going well, they can press the \"skip\" button to instantly dismiss their conversation partner and move onto the next participant. \n\n**Hosts**\n\n* Yoo Jae Suk\n* Jeon So Min\n* Nucksal\n\nStream: https://www.viu.com/ott/sg/en-us/vod/466850/The-Skip-Dating",

Really really hope that she will meet a great man that will make her happy. \nEven thought it wasn't as dominant as the previous episodes, Somin, Jae Suk and Nucksal tiki taka are still enjoyable to watch. The editing was a bit choppy, but still okay. Lookin forward for the next eps, it seems to be even more chaotic than eps 1-4",

            "comment": "I thought the first part was funny, but this second part was even more hilarious. I view this show more as a variety show than a dating show\u2014 *plus the whole thing happens only in a day*\u2014 so I don't really ship anyone and I don't really expect the final couples to start dating and last long. A part of that is that I'm also uncomfortable with some of the singles' \"skip details\" that list their ideal types. Sometimes for others, it seemed more like their own fetishes which irks me a bit. But then again, I can't judge them for what they show in a single day. \n\nAnyway, I'd say the events that occurred here were more interesting here than the first one: the pairings, rooms, lunch boxes, and final choices. I initially thought the singles who got their rooms destroyed would get bothered by it for the entirety of the show, but they just laughed it out. The reasons behind the \"skip\" were also kinda convincing and I found myself nodding throughout their thought processes. \n\nEvery single in the first part got a lunch box, and I felt relieved. In this part, though, almost &gt;!every lunch box went to Ano and YJ!&lt;. I was internally screaming and my reactions matched with the hosts and I got a good laugh. &gt;!MN saying she wanted to go home and that she missed her mom every time she didn't get a lunch box was hilarious!&lt; as well as the hosts' reactions. I didn't really notice SY at first,&gt;! but after realizing it was KM for her, dang she got my attention on how straightforward she became. !&lt;",

Anyway, the fetish thing I was referring to does not apply to this episode only, nor did I focus on sexualization. We all have preferences, maybe sometimes too specific, and that's okay. However, what I was referring to was there were a few (maybe including the latest eps) who expected their pairs to act like how they imagined them to be. First impressions, for example. When they didn't act as expected, they got disappointed and unconsciously showed their dissatisfaction towards the other person. Expectations are not always fulfilled, but at least try to act decent.\n\n&gt;But then again, I can't judge them for what they show in a single day.\n\nCould be editing, but these participants could also be acting without thinking much about their actions. So in the end, I just don't think much about their actions as well, just a few noticeable icks and that's it.",

Truly impressive, whoever ends up with her will be lucky. \n\nI liked MinA the best, her personality was just so casual and funny. I also liked her casual look/outfit. She was just chilling. Same with HyeJin, but I completely understand her not seeing someone 6 years younger as a man. Especially at their age. I'm 29, and anyone under 25 is a baby to me. \n\nI also think the girls really only chose based on charms and the person who seemed the kindest (two people said he was a good listener), and the men basically chose the shy and quiet youngest cute girl. Kind of expected this tbh. The dentist's decision in the end did not make sense to me, like at all. I've seen enough Korean media and know enough dudes in my life to know men rarely go for women with strong personalities who are fun, funny, energetic and opinionated. It's too much to handle. \ud83d\ude01 (Not all men of course, Asian men more so though) especially if there is a woman who is young and innocent; Toni literally mentioned that. It sounded kind of odd, but there was another dude the last round who also said something like this to the youngest female skipper. \n\nBasically, women care about how a man makes them feel and men care about how a woman naked them look; if that makes sense.",

They all seem like players.\n\nKinda felt bad for Myung Hwan, he didn't really have much to show for himself outside of his whole persona being about working out.\n\nJong Seok tried to win them over with his wealth and being a model, but sincerely couldn't stand watching him fetishise women. Also that negging attempt was just poor taste and I'm glad Yoo Jin caught it and discarded him.\n\nFeel like the 5 minute rotation would be better to have somewhere in the beginning of the show. I don't understand why they keep on insisting of having 3/4 of both episodes with people who didn't even share a single word with each other. What's the point of giving someone your meal in hopes that you'll get to talk with them, if you will get to talk to them anyways during the last 5 minutes. At least let them chat for a bit, if they gave them their lunch.\n\nIt seems it's done intentionally to make for more awkward situations, but after \"2\" episodes of this, I'm just getting a bit tired of it. Hope they make some changes with how segments are formatted.",

And the dating show is indeed more a fast variety form of dating show. They are instructed to do things at a certain time. \n\nI just don't understand the point. What is the point? According to the poster it's giving the hosts screen time.",

There is huge wall on her personality which shown in interview with pd. The only thing great about her is that she lowers her ego to be upfront with her feeling.",

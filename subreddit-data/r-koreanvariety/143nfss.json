takes a one-time shot on target from near the centerline that deflects off of **(FM 88)** left arm that was sticking out and hits the top left corner of the woodwork and DEFLECTS IN!, even if the ball didn't go in, a handball foul would have been called, so great goal by **(WC 119)**, the goal is scored as an OWN GOAL by **(FM 88)**, if i was the score keeper that was not an OWN GOAL that was a pure goal for **(WC 119)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' WC FOUL: **(WC 119)** goes for a hard slide tackle that takes down **(FM 88)** hard, VAR is called after refs issued a yellow card, they are

tracks it down but lays off it but it HITS THE POST and deflects towards the sidelines, for a WC kick in!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' FM Miss: **(FM 30)** takes a sideline kick-in from deep in FM territory with a short pass down the wing for **(FM 77)** who traps the ball and back passes to **(FM 30)**, WC defense forgot that **(FM 88)** was on the field all alone in WC territory, and **(FM 30)** kicks a beauty forward pass to **(FM 88)** who traps the ball, keeps control, turns around and sets up for a shot on net, **(FM 88)** takes a shot on target aimed for the near left side but it HITS THE POST and comes back into the field of play that **(WC 456)** clears out of bounds to the sidelines, what a glorious chance missed, great sequence of skills, but no ball in the net, upon the many replays, **(WC 01- GK)** gets her hand on the ball and actually gets the save, i thought it was a direct shot that hit the post!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' FM Miss: **(FM 30)** takes a sideline kick-in from WC corner area with a rolling cross to the middle that **(FM 99)** takes a one-time speedy bouncy ball aimed for the near side bottom left corner that **(WC 01- GK)** blocks, the ball

calls for **(WC 119)** re-enter the game as the three minute for the RED Card elapses, thirty seconds left in the first half!&lt;\n\nHALFTIME SCORE LINE: &gt;!------- WC 1 - 0 FM------------, looks like Elody has worked on her touch, it is a lot softer now and with more control.  Great effort by both teams, looks like FM aren't getting their lucky breaks even though they have their chances!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' FM Miss: **(FM 88)** strips the ball from **(WC 23)** who didn't have full control after trapping a lobbed ball, **(FM 88)** then kicks a forward cross pass to the right wing side where **(FM 77)** is running, **(FM 77)** takes a one-time shot aimed for the near side bottom right corner but **(WC 01- GK)** smothers the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' WC Miss: **(WC 119)** takes a sideline kick-in with a power shot on target (not a goal if it went in, since there was no other contact on the ball), **(FM 10- GK)** blocks the ball and it drops in front of her and she catches it!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' WC Miss: **(FM 10- GK)** throws a forward pass but **(WC 452)** sticks her leg out and her toe get a piece of the ball, **(WC 452)** cuts to the middle and kicks an outlet pass to the left wing for **(WC 456)** who then dribbles forward and takes a shot on target aimed for the near side bottom left corner that misses the net by a foot, **(FM 10- GK)** was in position to block the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' WC Miss: **(WC 452)** kicks a forward pass to the left wing for an unmarked **(WC 456)** who manages to gain control of the ball near the sidelines,she dribbles forward towards the corner and takes a shot on target that is a bad angle shot and **(FM 10- GK)** blocks with her knees and the ball goes out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' WC Miss: **(WC 456)** takes the corner kick with a mid height cross near the top of 10yard box where **(WC 119)** manages to get her head on but not enough re-direction towards the net that the ball misses the target by a wide margin and goes out of bounds for a goal kick, time is ticking away and WC is the team mostly on offense!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' WC Miss: **(WC 456)** takes the corner kick that is blocked by **(FM 30)**, **(FM 30)** kicks a forward pass to the center circle area that **(FM 88)** traps and dribbles towards the right wing side beating the stifling \"handsy\" defense of **(WC 23)**, **(FM 88)** gets to the 10 yard box area and manages to take a power shot on target aimed straight at **(WC 01- GK)** who easily catches and holds on to the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' WC GOAL: **(FM 10- GK)** rolls a pass to **(FM 30)** to the right wing side **(WC 456)** attacks with pressure and **(FM 30)** kicks a weak cross towards the middle that isn't going to anyone, **(WC 452)** tracks down the ball and takes a shot on target, but the shot is blocked by **(FM 10- GK)** who comes off her line and cuts the angles down, but the shot is deflected to **(WC 452)** who manages to take another shot on net that **(FM 30)** tries to block but ends up in the net, poor pass by **(FM 30)** that resulted in a counterattack that WC totally capitalized on, FM's spirits look down, Coach JJJ needs to call a time-out!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' FM Miss: **(FM 88)** kicks a cross pass that **(FM 77)** one-times on target but from distance that **(WC 01- GK)** easily saves!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' WC Miss: **(WC 452)** strips the ball from **(FM 99)** and kicks a long cross pass that nutmegs (goes through the legs of) **(FM 30)** and gets to **(WC 456)** who one-time shoots it on target aimed for the near side bottom right corner.  **(FM 10- GK)** comes up huge with a block that bounces out of bounds for a corner kick, **(WC 23)** subs off for **(WC 27)** to enter the game, **(FM 88)** subs off for **(FM 20)** to enter the game!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' FM Miss: **(FM 77)** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot on target that **(WC 01- GK)** blocks, the rebound drops to the front goal mouth area that **(FM 30)** takes a one-time volley shot on target that **(WC 01- GK)** smothers, what a great save, FM not getting any finish on their shots on target, **(WC 27)** subs off for **(WC 23)** to enter the game!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' FM Miss: **(FM 30)** takes a corner kick-in with a high lobbing flick shot that drops towards the WC goal mouth area that everyone manages to miss a touch before it hits the ground, the ball bounces high and **(FM 20)** touched the ball with her arms that were in the air!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' WC Miss: **(WC 119)** takes a power bullet shot from centerline aimed for the net that **(FM 10- GK)** manages to track and smother, there was some serious power in that shot!&lt;\n\nFINAL SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- **WC 2** - 0 FM------------, WC finally enter the Gold medal game with a great team effort, their passing may have been lacking but they did well, Elody comes up big with some hustle moments and soft touches, I am happy WC finally get their shot at Gold, their team defensive effort to keep the ball out of the net from FM's first strong attack was insane, everyone was ready to get in the way of the ball, true desperation, true grittiness from all WC women. FM had great chances but luck was not on their side for bounces.!&lt;\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!GT v FM, battle for the bronze medal, PSY and HyunYi play to win. KyungHee coming up big with some skill moves, why are the ladies crying at the end? did someone get seriously hurt? NOOOO!!&lt;",

Tiger Moth's passing is also very good(So Yeon and PSY). Soo Ah and So Yeon combination is seriously good. Ga Ryeong is better at defending while So Yeon is so much better at attacking.\n\nAlready four seasons and World Class's Saori positioning is still super bad.\nSoari does not move to empty spot or move behind opponent's defender. When Naty get the ball, Saori didn't move to the front but stayed behind Naty and opponent's defender and expect Naty to pass the ball to her. \nSoari's positioning is really detrimental to World Class team playing.\nWorld Class's defender can't pass to right side because Saori moved to left side behind Naty. And World Class's defender can't pass to Naty because Saori is blocking it.",

I am not sure if they were too nervous/excited that they played very \"tight\", instead of \"loose\" which what they always did. And that is what makes WorldClass a scary team from the beginning with all the skilled players they have. I am a big fan of WorldClass from their debut, but unless they get this \"emotion\" figures out, it will be hard form them to beat FC Actionista in the final.",

            "comment": "First off that teaser at the end... &gt;!The Absolute is absolutely retiring. First off I've noticed her this season playing a lot more happily and less intense. Not in a she's given up type of way but in a she's enjoying her final season type of way. Secondly, there's no real other option given how everyone is shocked and crying while the two teams are lined up. It's not like someone gets hurt in that situation. Someone made an announcement. Hyunyi is shown looking over at Fire Moth while crying and Sun Young is not shown at all in the clip. I hope the reason is fun like she got a boyfriend or is getting married, rather than her just purely moving on from the show. Though of course that would be understandable. Also I don't love the idea of Fire Moth members HAVING to be single to be on the team so if she left cause she had a lover, that might low-key suck. Anyways, Fire Moth will be in a very interesting place if she leaves. She is not only the captain but the definition of a solid player and her through passes in this match were great. If the concept of the team is single/unmarried women, at least they have a large pool of celebrities to source their next player from.!&lt;\n\nAs for the game, that was a ton of fun. Way more fun than the score would indicate. I'm so happy to see the individual skills of Saori show up in the match that you see on her IG. Those skills she used to get past defenders were the \"next step\" many of the players in the league need to take. Natty looked good, no big jump in development but is on the right path. Elodie, dang. She is playing real well and I think her weight loss is a great indication of her improved fitness. Lastly, Kathy, -stands and applauds-. Wow. What a performance. If she is consistently just about that good then she is arguably the best in-the-box goalie on the show. I think others, like Kisum, have her beat in terms of all around goalie skills but when she is between the crossbars blocking shots she is amazing.\n\nFire Moth honestly had an unlucky day. It's brutal to go against a good goalie, but to go against a good goalie who had an amazing match? You rarely win no matter what. FM had so many shots on goal but Kathy was perfect. I loved the move of having Sun Young back on defense, especially with her talent for through passes to the offense, and to have So Yeon on offense. Dang, I feel sooooooooo bad for her having ANOTHER own goal. She looks tough but she's really soft, sensitive and competitive so not scoring when moved to offense is bad enough, but an own goal on top of that? Brutal. Oh and FM's goalie had a good game too!\n\n*edit: I wanted to add that Kang So Yeon was another player whose hard work in training and skill on her IG showed up in this match. Her positioning, her receiving tough passes, her shots on the goal and so on were all really nice for a player with a year more experience than she has. She is developing really, really nicely.*\n\nAs for the Championship match, it's honestly win-win for me. I'm a big fan of World Class but Actionista, specifically He In, are fun and I'd be happy to see them win. Who do I predict will win? That's so tough because Actionista seems to consistently score and it's rarely fluky stuff. But I'm more confident in World Class's goalie and defense, while I think WC has a good enough offense with Saori and Natty to put points on the board. So I'll say WC.\n\nAs for the 3rd and 4th place match, I definitely think the Giants are the better team ~~and, especially if The Absolute is retiring, I want to see Fire Moth get demoted and work on themselves in the CL while the Giants stay in the SL and compete again next season for the Championship. The Giants have their pieces, going down to the CL doesn't make them better, they need to win to stay in the SL so next season is about winning it all and not about getting promoted back to the SL.~~ and they will win vs Fire Moth.",

She is the only player who understand the flow of the soccer and the timing of when to take a shot (and positioning) from the very beginning. Watching the old games really show her skills and understanding of the game. I hated her from the start because she is just so good compared to the other players on the show. Her growth is so subtle (not showy), that it showed in all the games that FC Bullabang played. I am always a fan of keeping a team intact, and worried what will happen to Bullabang going forward. They have just started to have the pieces together, and now the big center piece will be missing (if she is truly retiring). They can have all the physique of SoYeon and the instinct of SoAh, but without PSY connecting them together it will be useless. PSY is always a versatile player that can work with any of the best players. We saw that in the All Star games and those training-abroad game. It will be hard for Bullabang going forward to bring in someone new and be the general on the field. It is about field vision and understanding/utilizing the weapons around you, which so far nobody in the league can do, yet. She will surely be missed!",

But I wouldn't hype her up as much as you have. She's a pillar of the show, sure, but in the past year a bunch of younger talents have gotten to her level if not shown better play. Almost every team has lost a big time player and now it's time for Fire Moth, assuming she retires. I'm fine with one of the oldest cast members on the show hanging up her shoes and not sticking around for more full time soccer (given all the time they have to spend practicing, working out, recovering from injuries, etc). \n\nSo \"Fire Moth is useless without PSY\" is too strong to me. Yes, they'll downgrade as a team losing that talent but they'll just need to find a defender. If the team concept really is \"single/unmarried\" then it shouldn't be too hard for the Producers to find another talent like So Yeon. Who knows, maybe the woman they get has played some soccer before (like So Hee, Seogi, Kyungseo, Kisum and Bokyung) and so the team doesn't regress too much as they fit the new player in. All while So Yeon continues to develop quickly and become more productive.",

I always felt like they were a Kathy complete game away from fighting for the title and boy did Kathy have in my opinion her best game ever. They predictably had a slow start (you could it coming with how quiet and tense they were before the game) and them not conceding in the beginning gave the time needed to loosen up. You can tell that Eva is still not 100% with her knee and because of that Elody was immense her having the speed to cover on the counter and ball carry into midfield helped connect the back line with saori and Naty. With tiger moth they just couldn\u2019t get past Kathy. PSY is in my opinion the smartest and most efficient player in the league her positioning saves her energy and allows her to break pressure on the counter. I feel for So yeon she is in that stage that athletes have where they play well but have the worst luck. I think next week will be PSY last game the moment they were crying was at the end of the game (they were lined up to bow), I feel like she\u2019s gonna take the shoes off and take off the shin guards and announce it.

Kathy had one of those games where it doesn't matter if they played 10 two minute halves or two 25 minute halves like The Gentlemen's League, she won't concede a goal, her reaction time has improved, cuz there were several moments in the game where she was caught unaware, but she was still able to save the goal.\n\nSaori and Naty played like how they were expected to play, fast and explosive.\n\nTiger Moth had nothing to be ashamed about, they did everything right, Kathy was just at the top of her game.\n\nOnto next week's episode;\n\n I think based on the previews that Park Sun Young is retiring from the show, she's the only one who could elicit that type of reaction from everyone. They probably lost too.",

Except for Katy. Katy just have a game of her life, and her performance is worthy of golden gloves. They played  a weak defense and a scattered offense. Not the usual explosive and threatening style that they always showed. Passing was non existent and it seems like Eva is regressing this season. Not sure if it was her knee injury, but physically and tactically she was always off. Kind of a disappointing game from what I expected from this team.\n\nFC Bullabang will keep on growing if this team stayed intact. We know that they still do not have the technical skills of the other upper echelon Super League team, but they managed to dictate the game and unluckily played on a day that Katy was GK goddess. They did not have the agility or dribbling prowess (yet) but they managed to connect by great passing and positioning. Kudos to them.\n\nOverall an okay game with a lot of highlight reels for the goalkeepers, and both side. From the preview, the next game between FC Gucheok and FC Bullabang will offer more excitement that is expected of Super League. Not sure about the final game though if this is the level that these teams are playing.",

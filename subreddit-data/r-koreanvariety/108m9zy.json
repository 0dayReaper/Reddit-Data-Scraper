            "comment": "Love Catcher 2 was the best season tbh, LC1 was solid and LC3 is a big pass from me, Love Catcher 4 which is on right now (last ep this Friday) for me could be better than LC2 depending on how it ends. Heart Signal 2 was good, imo I'd skip s1 and s3. And if your into Chinese versions, Heart Signal s2 was good and s5 just finished and i reallly enjoyed it.\n\nIf you have the time Id watch in order LC1, LC2, LC4, then HS2, Chinese HS2 and Chinese HS5.\n\nif you don't have the time and i had to choose, I'd go LC2, LC4, HS2",

            "comment": "Ya some of us consider **Love Catcher Season 2** legendary. Same with **Heart Signal Season 2**, for both the Korean and Chinese versions of Heart Signal.\n\n**Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac)** is already an instant classic to me due to its unparalleled visuals. Like no other Korean/Chinese/Japanese/etc. dating show comes close, it's like the difference between heaven and earth as some /r/ProgressionFantasy, cultivation, East Asian web novels (check /r/noveltranslations, we repeat many phrases like that there all the time) will say.\n\n---\n\n**Don't forget Terrace House (/r/terracehouse) and its Chinese version, Shanghai Sharelife (/r/Shanghaisharelife).** Those are the classics of the dating show genre.\n\nSome people's list is probably like this: **Shanghai Sharelife** preferred over **Terrace House**, which is favored over **Heart Signal (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110)**, and now the **EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560)** series, with possibly **Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774)** and **Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac)** in tow.\n\nAt the moment the current influential dating shows in East Asia goes like this: Terrace House inspired Heart Signal and then Heart Signal gave way to Transit Love/EXchange. Single\u2019s Inferno is also kinda in this as a lot of island/beach/etc. shows got made because of it.\n\nTerrace House and so on have like 40 minutes per episode but they have dozens, hundreds of episodes.

            "comment": "This is just my personal opinion. While Andre was definitely in the wrong for not pushing the line, I don't think him \"talking back\" was that big of an issue because it's much better for players to understand why they were doing something rather than just blindly following instructions without understanding the reason. IIRC, the episode after that had LDG mentioning to Andre during half-time talk about how the off-side trap worked when he kept to the line, and he understood it.\n\n\nAlso, his logic wasn't that misguided at all. When playing a high line, the defense is very exposed if the off-side trap is beaten (even if everyone kept the line). So to cover that, he wanted to be playing as more of a sweeper. The logic is not wrong, but the implementation by going against manager's instruction is wrong. \n\n\nThis is why I think the show should definitely have more coaching sessions with discussions and video reviews rather than constant physical practice sessions. Asking the players to climb up 300 stairs once is funny, but it does almost nothing in improving their physique/stamina. The hours spent on that could've been used for coaching sessions where players could ask questions, and manager/coach could show the players what they did wrong and how to fix it.\n\n&gt; im actually glad that the coaching staff are holding another tryout/audition so that it would humble andre a little bit.\n\nAs much as I can see that quite a few people here are not a fan of him, he is very clearly the first choice and best CB in the team that his position isn't really the one being threatened.",

                            "comment": "&gt; but its strange to me that he still does not understand the offside rule after playing many games as a defensive player \n\nThis is something that I saw mentioned a few times, but I think it's a misunderstanding. IIRC, what he meant was more that he didn't understand why he's asked to keep the line high, not that he didn't understand what the offside rule is. This is why during the half-time talk, LDG asked why Andre was scared and dropping back. \n\n\nAlso, interestingly, if you rewatch that failed offside trap that made LDG angry at Andre, you'd see that Jeju's no.10 (the one who made the run) was the fourth player and was kept onside by Min-ho even if Andre kept the line. I don't know whether it was done on purpose, but the editing of drawing the line (during the half-time talk) purposely not include Min-ho who was at the bottom of the screen and covered by huge caption. During the initial replay, the line was drawn on Andre alone and it was clear that no.10 was behind Min-ho and onside even if the line was drawn on Min-ho instead of Andre. \n\n\nSo objectively speaking, Andre was actually right in the content of his talking back. But obviously still wrong in the act of talking back itself, especially in the middle of the game.\n\n&gt; i think its good to rotate some players from time to time like what they do with the GKs and the wingbacks\n\nI agree, but the problem is always the player's availability and quality. It's hard to play second-choice CB when the goal is to improve by playing against tougher opponents.",

It's that he didn't understand why the manager wanted to play the high-line tactic during that game. He basically disagreed with the tactic and thought playing as sweeper would've been safer. During the half-time talk, he clearly said that he was scared that the opponents would go through and then nobody would cover, so he took it upon himself to be that player who covered by stepping back. \n\n&gt; thats why i think he is not the best defensive player we have\n\nWho else is better CB than Andre in the team? I'm not saying that he's amazing. I'm saying that the team don't have anyone better. Je-un is the closest, but he's far too quiet which made him unable to lead the defense.",

Minho told Andre off during the corner kick defense, directly after LDG yelling at Andre, in the first half. The part where Andre said he doesn't understand is during the extra time. Have a look at this https://imgur.com/a/oJ1fj6H \n\n&gt; and about the CB, thats why they are holding another audition they are finding other players for the role\n\nSure, the team definitely need more players. But if it's for quality improvement, Andre is definitely not the CB whose position is under threat. And honestly, there are definitely other positions that need more improvement than CB.",

Things get heated, players with players and even players with coaches butt heads. Idk about Korean (or Japanese or Chinese) sports but I imagine even with the age hierarchy that things get heated, comments get made and so on. It doesn't mean it's not disrespectful but at the same time I imagine the coaches know better than anyone how heated things can get and how people act in those situations. Not to mention, while we don't really see it, there are probably a lot of ego's on the roster of this show. Too many star athletes for it to be ego-less. They also likely tend to revert to how they operate when playing their sport. As the Captain of a rugby team maybe they operated \"Western\" style and as a part Westerner who maybe socializes a lot more with Westerners, that's just his culture/style. \n\nBut I will say, even the episodes I'm caught up on, I did notice Andre came back to the show post-injury with a certain attitude and \"persona\" that I wasn't really a fan of. He beefed with the Nordic combined athlete that was playing in his spot and threw spicy comments his way which wasn't my favorite. Thankfully they eventually became close and seem like friends now but I'm not shocked to hear of him continuing to be a little lippy. \n\nI'll be curious to catch up and watch the scenes. I wonder if a mountain is being made out of mole hill or if he was, by non SK standards, what even I would call disrespectful and out of line.",

            "comment": "Oohh, so everyone really noticed how he talked back to lee dong wook and minho. It was a heated game tbh, but yeah, he was really out of the line. Chilku got mad as well in the previous episode coz he went out of the defensive line again to attack.  I've been observing him and he is a bit bossy,  then when he commits mistakes, he would command the others as defense mechanism. \n\n Gosh, is it just me but when minho told him off to listen to coaching staff, he became manlier to me. Hahaha! Minho has that commanding presence. \ud83e\udd2d",

            "comment": "Yes, Andre was in the wrong, even in a western coaching system not understanding rules/ strategy would automatically get you benched. However, since that game regarding offsides and his team on his ass, I think he's played better (on Netflix at least) and hasn't been an ongoing nuisance.\n\nBTW is there a way I can watch the recent eps with eng subs rather than being so far behind through Netflix? I really hope coach Ahn finally kicks Hyung taik/dong hyun off. I feel their lazy nonchalant attitudes are just as detrimental as Andre's. Plus they're just less skilled still.",

I feel like this thing is overblown here while the team seemed to have moved on from it just fine.",

He is a very self-centered and arrogent person.\n\nHe wasn't good at attacking and yet he kept wanting to be a striker in the beginning. A lot of dangerous situations and lost goals were due to his defensive mistakes and him being out of position due to his 'attacking instinct'. The editing usually makes it like it is the GKs' (Dong Hyun and Hyung Tae) fault because they are the joke / sandbag character on the team.\n\nThe worse was when Andre Jin doesn't even know that he was the reason the opposing team were onside instead of offside. I was rather happy when he was benched / not the starter in the next match.\n\nThe defensive line up was much more stable when it was Je-Un and Jang Gun.",

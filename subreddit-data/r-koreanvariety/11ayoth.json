    "postText": "What\u2019s you\u2019re favorite Korean Dating Show? Personal favorites are I Am Solo and Skip. IAS has mainly regular people with regular careers. The participants all live together and date for about a week. The intent is more serious about getting an actual romantic partner than just media exposure for themselves or their business. Several season ending couples have actually married each other. Only downside or upside, the participants, especially the men, are not visually as attractive as in other shows. Skip is blind speed dating with very attractive and career focused participants. Only filmed over one day, this basically skips all drama of the week long shows and gets to the idea of whether you\u2019re attracted to someone in 3 seconds or less. More focused on finding a date than an actual partner. It\u2019s essentially for attractive people who don\u2019t have the time to commit for shows like Singles Inferno.\n\nEdit 1: damn! Y\u2019all really lovin TL and SI. My fav IAS is getting almost no love or votes, lmao.\n\nEdit 2: Transit Love is the overall favorite with Singles Inferno second.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/11ayoth)",

A week, or even two weeks is just not enough time to really get to know a total stranger. I think another aspect I like in these shows is that people live in one place, and still continue to work. Then others get an idea of what a person's daily life is like. I think the worst show regarding these two aspects is Singles Inferno. Not only do they only have a week on the island, where they basically do nothing, they don't even get to find out what each other do in the real world UNLESS they choose each other for paradise. But choosing someone to go to paradise after you've known them for a day?? It's just not enough time. I've read that researchers have said that male-female pair bonds need 10 weeks (of seeing each other daily) to develop, at minimum. I would love to see a show where the people were together for that long, 2+ months.",

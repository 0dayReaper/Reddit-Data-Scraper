    "postText": "Narare and code kunst date was so freaking wholesome. Code kunst was such a gentleman and narae was being more timid than usual. It made me really sad when Narae cried. From what I\u2019ve seen in I live alone, Narae is a very caring person who likes to give and take care of people. In general, she gives a mom of the group vibes even when he is hanging out with kian84 or hyunmoo who is older. In this date episode, code kunst was very considerate of her and always put her wants a priority. I think that\u2018s the reason she cried because no man has ever been this considerate of her.  Like in the episode she would have side comments kind of berating herself, but code kunst would always just give genuine compliments instead of just ignoring or laughing about it. I genuinely wish she finds happiness soon and defies the tarot reading predictions.",

I thought Jang do yeon would become a regular when she came, but it seems like she took a break from tv. The actress who was good at carpentry and likes camping used to appear often but she hasn\u2019t appeared in years\ud83d\ude05 I think honey J was supposed to be an established member then she became pregnant so she had to leave. I\u2019m assuming this because her relationship wasn\u2019t even public until the pregnancy announcement and she had a lot of segments in the show.",

The care Code Kunst took in making it a memorable day for Narae was so sweet. The piano segment, and then when Narae started to cry. All of his compliments. I'm so saddened that Narae feels like everything she dreamed of would just end in dreams, and would never happen in person. I'm so glad Code Kunst really did everything for her, when he could have just made it a funny date. And I hope she finds someone who will fulfill all of her deepest desires.",

I remember when she was on WGM with Yang Se-Chan and she confessed she really had feelings for him at some point \ud83e\udd72 and in another variety show when they swap homes she goes to LA and flirts with this attractive white guy and the preview shows her being kinda drunk in a bbq/pool party but nothing ever happens in the next episode (like it was cut off) so who knows what happened . But I guess it could of been controversial just her being drunk and then her 18+Netflix comedy show and her sexual harassment scandal. We forget she is human and extra flirty at times even though she takes care of the people she loves while she grows in age. I love her regardless she is true to herself and she deserves to be loved and not mocked or looked down !",

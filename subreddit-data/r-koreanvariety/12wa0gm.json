Lee Mijoo, Hyeri and others as well, a really pretty woman that would usually be perceived as cold and inaccessible giving 100% for a laugh is very charming. \n\nI am sure there are others as well I am not thinking of, but for me personally Somin is the perfect example of this. She also takes it to the next level \u00e0 la Lee Kwangsoo who was probably mine (and a lot of people's) favorite RM member.",

If there is another guest, I'm guesing it will be Yena's brother Sungmin. I watched this yesterday without subs and I'd have sworn Chaewon had a crush on Jonathan until Yena said he didn't know La Serrafim. With the subs, I guess she just liked how funny he is and wants to be funny like that. It's nice to see Miyeon no longer embarrassed. She's really funny when she commits to it. I love how Yena chooses comedy over being good unless she has a chance to tease Chaewon, at which point she easily wins at everything.!&lt;",

In the original show the clip is from the context was they started speaking informally to eachother on that day so they can develop a rapport as panelists, so probably means they haven\u2019t been friends for 7 years and met on that show (this year).",

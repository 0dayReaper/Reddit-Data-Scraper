Back when Kyuhyun was serving it didn't stop them from filming?\n\nAhn Jaehyun is also back...\n\nThere was rumors of season 9 being filmed all the way back in 2021! I wonder what happened? Is the cast too busy? Or did they think it was time to drop the show completely?",

He just finished Earth Arcade the show under tvN, he has been doing alot of youtube shows now, (the game caterers, the drinking show, and hospital playlist videos) And he's currently filming(maybe done with filming?) Seojin's kitchen in Mexico.. I would say he may have plans for it...but cant really produce two shows under tvN at the same time. He has alot of PDs that have worked with him before in NJTW still working with him, so hopefully they would want to work together on another season since travel bans have been lifted for awhile now",

I think this rule was instated due to someone higher up. This may be why Na PD has been focusing on his YT channel with his mini series stuff.\n\nThis makes me sad because NJTTW is my favorite show. I still watch clips on YT during lunch breaks lol. Very funny and comforting to watch.",

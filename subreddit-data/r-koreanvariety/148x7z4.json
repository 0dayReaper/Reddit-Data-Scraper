Our production team is listening to everything that viewers said was good or lacking [from the first season]. We decided to make everything brand new in Season 2, except for the one key line from Season 1: \u2018Searching for the most perfect physical.\u2019 I think this is the only way to repay the viewers who have kindly given the show lots of love.\u201d\n\nPD Jang Ho Gi added, \u201cWe are creating an entirely new world by crafting a larger set than Season 1, which was the size of two soccer fields. This time, I think we will be able to bring more formidable contestants that weren\u2019t able to join us in the previous season. We are also working with numerous experts to design stronger and more intense quests than Season 1.\u201d\n\nFinally, the PD teased, \u201cRather than making vague promises to produce a more fun and better season, we [promise] to come back with an evolved and dramatic transformation in every aspect of the show.\u201d\n\n___\nSource: [Soompi](https://www.soompi.com/article/1593759wpp/netflixs-physical-100-confirmed-to-return-with-season-2) &amp; ([1](https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1668770226421514240?s=20)),([2](https://twitter.com/NetflixKR/status/1668771013507833857?s=20)),([3](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/physical-100-netflix-korean-hit-competition-second-season-1235642165/))\n| Edit: Added Soompi as a source.",

Also, if they were not paid to participate, what incentive should be given to them?Sungbin said that he was not paid while Sarang's father said he was paid but was not enough to cover his stay in KR i assume.",

They definitely should be paid on some level, but reality is that Choi Sung-hoon is a much bigger name than most of the contestants there so he's gonna be paid much higher amount than the rest.",

Those body types have their place amongst athletes as well.",

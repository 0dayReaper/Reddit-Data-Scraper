Jonathan visiting, morning quest and individual quests were on the same weekend (1) and the yutnori is the next weekend (2)? Seems like they played the mini version then (1), cause they showed it on the floor. \n\nIt felt really weird, I don't understand why they did the time jump and with such a short period. They could've showed us more of what they do/play on their own. Leejung's dance class was more fun than the morning quest and the yutnori. Not to mention the mafia game from a few episodes ago or even when they played gonggi.",

They also mentioned that they only get to meet each other 6 times so that amounted to 12 episodes. \n\nSo for this episode, like they skipped a lot during the night before Jonathan leaves and after. They did the morning mission and failed and did individual missions and then after that, ends the shoot. \n\nThey came back 2 weeks later for filming and the nutyori game is the first game they played. This is considered to be their 5th time meeting each other. \n\nI just hoping that they edited it like this cause there are more interesting things happening here than in episode 8. So they squeezed in a bit of the first game in here.",

Chaewon came later during the shoot and finished up the game.\n\nThen in episode 7, they went on a cable car ride and met Jonathan at the end. They also played a game when they get back to their house. \n\nSo episode 9 will be the continuation of the nutyori game that they played at the end of episode 8. They kinda squeezed the first part of it so I kinda hoping episode 9 has a lot of things happening that they have to squeeze in a segment in episode 8.",

I would have been more interested in their own indoor yutnori game or seeing their mafia game. The one part I thought was great after he left was the dance training which seemed to keep the same energy.\n\nYena and Chaewon are gonna be in trouble for not knowing that Ive song. Especially when Yena is getting a lot of them, including a trot song. Maybe the best part was when all the girls just sat there realizing Yena got Chunga's song right and then instantly leapt to their feet to dance it.",

I'm a movie buff too, and I knew around 8-9 out of 10, but they had to do 14 in a row?! \n\nThe funny/dirty part of that quiz is that quite often the English movie title isn't translated to Korean/Chinese/Japanese directly, but has a totally different one. I believe The Matrix was called \"Electronic Mass Murderers\" or something in one of those languages. :D So they probably know both names and that messes with your split second memory recall :P",

I've been following lee hangyul since he popped onto the scene and it's been.. a journey. starting as a back up dancer, finishing 13th on the unit, debuting in X1 and then going through that scandal, debuting as a duo with nam dohyon, debuting again with &gt;!bae173!&lt; during the pandemic, taking on the role of leader a year and a half into promotions .. no one can say this man isn't giving it his all to achieve his dream. not to mention the heartwarming story of his adoption and the driving force behind his positive attitude.\n\nI do wish he'd be a little more open and vulnerable about everything he's been though so that the GP can know his story. He's comes across as a 'silver lining' kind of person who takes on the mood maker role and never shows any struggles or hardships but I think on a show like this telling his story would be good for him and his group.\n\nBut honestly .. JUST DO A PEAK TIME FESTIVAL STYLE TOUR. TAKE THEM ALL. LET THEM ALL BE WINNERS LOL. there isn't a single undeserving group here and i'm just really glad the show is doing well and theyre all gaining new fans.",

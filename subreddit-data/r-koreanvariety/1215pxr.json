    "postText": "I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations of variety shows with a cast of actors, or including a few actors. An example would be things like Young Actor\u2019s Retreat, Game Caterers (when they have actors on), basically programs that have actors as main hosts or programs with plenty of actors as guests! \n\nHealing, Comedy, doesn\u2019t matter the genre of the program, any recommendations would be great!!",

Cast member include Kang Hodong, Lee Soo Geun, Eun Ji Won, Ahn Jae Hyun, Kyuhyun, Mino, PO and Lee Seung Gi( season 1). I suggest you start with season 2. Season 1 was more of experimental. Producer is NA PD. I suggest you watch all of his shows : Youth Over Flowers, Game Caterers, Unexpected Journey to name a few. All shows on his YT channel: CHANNEL FULL MOON. It's really funny. But please watch NJTTW first. I love it!",

Some significant guests include Gong Yoo (co-actor from Goblin), Lee Se Dol (master of game of Go, beaten by AI Alpha Go), Lee Soo Geun (comedian), BoA, and a chef featured in a Netflix cooking show living as a Buddhist monk.",

Usually Bilibili is available but that's for people that can read Chinese characters, otherwise it'd be on Viki/VIU/iQIYI/Netflix/etc.\n\nCheck MyDramaList pages using the filter \"Dating Show\" (or Reality Show, Variety Show, etc.) or something like that, a lot of the Chinese/Korean/Southeast Asian/etc. dating shows released after 2020, but there were quite a few even before then.\n\n---\n\nIf you want to be serious about learning Korean, there's a lot of really good gamified/etc. apps now. You should be able to understand basic Korean (obviously not fluent, just the often repeated phrases and so on) within say 30 or so days. A lot of Korean/etc. dating shows and variety shows have simple conversations or vocabulary and so it's easy to follow.\n\nIf you want to do some /r/languagelearning with Korean, Japanese, Chinese, check here for the recommended apps and resources: https://www.reddit.com/r/Physical100/comments/10kzl0i/i_hope_people_start_to_remember_the_contestants/j5tp3o6/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/104w0ib/why_chinese_names_in_kpop_are_like_that_or/j38bf3v/\n\nBasically look into LingoDeer, Anki(Droid), Talk To Me In Korean, Learn Korean with GO! Billy Korean, et cetera.\n\nFor Chinese/Mandarin/etc. there's HelloChinese, Pleco, etc. and try visiting /r/ChineseLanguage, it's way harder to remember how to read/write in Chinese characters as you have to memorize it. Definitely make sure to prioritize SRS stuff like Anki(Droid).\n\n---\n\nTry **Terrace House (/r/terracehouse), Shanghai Sharelife (/r/Shanghaisharelife), Heart Signal, Love Catcher in Bali, Pink Lie**, et cetera next if you haven't already.\n\nSome people's list is probably like this: **Shanghai Sharelife** preferred over **Terrace House**, which is favored over **Heart Signal (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110 and \u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7)**, and now the **EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560)** series, with possibly **Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac)** and **Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774)** in tow.\n\nAt the moment the current influential dating shows in East Asia goes like this: Terrace House inspired Heart Signal and then Heart Signal gave way to Transit Love/EXchange. Single\u2019s Inferno is also kinda in this as a lot of island/beach/etc. shows got made because of it.\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and Kdramas, East Asian films, et cetera, and more info on where to watch them**: https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/10vdoyn/love_is_blind_korea/j7gz987/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10rr1t6/uma_game_episode_4_230202/j77hfij/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10r0dje/kpop_house/j6sw6un/\n\n---\n\n**This thread has the different names of streaming/OTT services (like TVING, Coupang Play, wavve, etc.) or websites and the various Youtube channels and links for where to watch some of these dating shows**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yktjg9/can_anyone_suggest_some_kdating_shows/iuvbg43/\n\n---\n\n**Shows maybe like Terrace House**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10pyock/im_just_sad_terrace_house_is_gone_i_miss_them_all/j6ri6vt/?context=10000 and https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/10y83wy/maybe_folks_here_can_help_me_understand/j7ydnc6/\n\n---\n\n**More info on ArmsAsuncion's website for redditors (it has East Asian dating/variety/etc. shows, Kdramas/Jdoramas/Cdramas/et cetera), tteokbeokkisubs/noonaspoiler, adblock, VPNs, and so on**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10fpzhx/overall_thoughts_on_love_catcher_in_bali/j5cmhaw/\n\n---\n\n**A master list (of Korean dating shows) that some people update fairly regularly**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Igp0Nh8w46uA7uumTYeWoG4wV1kc4BJAn3R4cZgE7Uk\n\n**This is a fan playlist of some Chinese dating shows (often available on Youtube for free through the YOUKU, iQIYI, Tencent Video/WeTV, etc. official channels)**: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNnLfxJ2ybB2BW4sjK1VTinwrySp7A_R\n\n**That playlist of Chinese dating shows also has its own Google Docs sheet for other Chinese (dating and variety) shows**: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12vG-7Qtu5KbNHGHFS8GNzolbf3Lmu_fUA0YL6lGXTAk\n\n---\n\n**Check MyDramaList too for a more visual list of these East Asian variety shows, dating shows, dramas, et cetera**.

Maybe they could hide supplies across the island, and they have to split into groups to track everything down (beyond the get water in a trio thing). I feel like I'd want to see situations that can show more of the casts' personalities. It would also be cool if they had more artistic challenges, like a painting challenge, singing challenge etc. That would be harder to score though.",

There were a few remarks from season one participants that the experience on the island was rough enough with the bugs and heat.\n\nThe whole point of the show is to show beautiful bodies and faces.  Hence makeup and hair salon on the island.  Secondary point is to highlight fashion, as in product placement.\n\nThere should be more games, and make it more survivor style, but supposedly they show only a fraction of the footage they have.  Overall the show is heavily edited and somewhat scripted or influenced actually. None of it is \"real\".",

Like damn, imagine if Netflix distributed YOUKU/etc. shows. Sigh.\n\n---\n\n**Office Romance (\uc0ac\ub0b4\uc5f0\uc560)** also recently got properly subbed and released now on Viki. \n\nThere's this guy named Jeonghoon (he is in that Company/Office Romance (\uc0ac\ub0b4\uc5f0\uc560) dating show) from ZAMSTER/LookGating videos and he's in some videos, like Single's Inferno Season 2's Hanbin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPhBXNyXtCg&amp;t=42s.\n\nThe girl in that LookGating video with Hanbin is ChuJeong/\uce04\uc815, she's in a new Korean dating show called **Love Alarm: Clap! Clap! Clap! (\uc88b\uc544\ud558\uba74 \uc6b8\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9dd!\uc9dd!\uc9dd!)**, it just finished. It's based off a Korean webtoon, there's actually a Kdrama (from 3 or so years ago) of the webtoon on Netflix.\n\nNetflix should just get the international streaming rights for those dating shows exclusively funded by the Korean OTT/streaming services, lol. \n\nLike the point is to get people to subscribe to those new streaming services but fam, international viewers get no English subs. We're not the main audience for those Korean dating shows even though these days they give us (well, the Southeast Asian/VIU/Viki/etc. viewers) shoutouts, lol.\n\n---",

Seriously, how come everyone is still subbing Japanese anime, manga, light novels, et cetera, but barely any of these dating shows. \n\nSwear if Japan stops trying to be insular and actually provide easy English subtitles to their new online services, there'd be so much gain for everyone. Then again, they're content with their own domestic market, like it's sorta actually wild from a sociological view how they can still sustain that.\n\nWith ABEMA shows don't expect English subs, more info at the bottom of the comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10pyock/im_just_sad_terrace_house_is_gone_i_miss_them_all/j6st18w/\n\nThe newest ABEMA one is about (Korean/Japanese) idols that will date before debuting, lol.\n\nIt's called **Romance Before Debut (\u30ed\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306f\u3001\u30c7\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u524d\u306b\u3002)**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKVyebCB3ug\n\nTrailer and discussion about Romance Before Debut before it released two weeks ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e257KzHjb4 and https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/109jq5z/the_dating_reality_show_romance_before_debut/\n\nThere's also **Shuffle Island (\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30d5\u30eb\u30a2\u30a4\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9) Season 3**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsxjM2uB8S4\n\nAnd **Heart Signal Japan**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2DWOkvRPRQ\n\nI would sub these Japanese shows for free but unfortunately it's been several years since my translating Japanese media days. And people really underestimate how long it takes to sync the subs to the video, like it's too much pressure to keep a schedule, lol.

If Earth Arcade can have S2 with Yujin's equally busy schedule, i am sure they can work something out with Chaewon as well.\n\nThough I am guessing the filming schedule for Earth Arcade and HMLYCP is quite different whereby Earth Arcade is an oversea, continuous 1-2 weeks shoot, while HMLYCP is a recurring shoot over 1-2 months.\n\nHonestly, I feel like HMLYCP can just follow Earth Arcade filming schedule and have a continuous 1-2 weeks shooting to accommodate the idols, since it's definitely much easier to schedule.",

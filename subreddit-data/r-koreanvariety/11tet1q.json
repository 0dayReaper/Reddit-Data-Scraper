                    "comment": "&gt;but my first reaction was definitely that it was another all male actor travel show...\n\nI do wonder if it is a case of stations / PDs not wanting / willing to cast actresses and female entertainers. Or is it a case of actresses aren't interested to be casted on variety shows. (Afterall public image are very important for actresses since it more or less determine the type of roles she get.) Or is it because all female members variety shows aren't well-received? Probably a mixture of the above I suppose.\n\n(Sidenote, travel variety with mixed cast might be challenging logistically due to separate rooms for men and women. Those will all need camera setup in each room. Effectively doubling the amount of cameras and setup needed. Since travel variety, esp oversea ones tend to run with a bare minimal skeletal crew, this might be why it is easier to go with 1 gender.)\n\nHere are some observations off the top of my mind based on past and current variety shows with all female members.\n\n- 3MAD Mountain Village is highly entertaining but there isn't a follow-up season with a different set of actresses. Whereas 3MAD with actors had multiple varients and many different set of actors.\n\n- Gamsung Camping (all female cast) vs House on Wheels (all male cast) basically had the same concept (driving and camping with a caravan). But HoW had 4 seasons while GC only had 1.\n\n- Shooting Stars vs Jump like a Witch. Sport centric variety with all female members. SS is highly successful and entertaining. Quickly went from a Chuseok special into a seasonal show into a 'seasonal show with no breaks in airing'. While JlaW tanked and got canned. Main difference is that SS has its own league and players showed chemistry, passion, commitment and improvement. JlaW on the other hand lacks all of those.\n\nThen there's the Lee Hyori's upcoming travelling divas show but that is mainly driven by the charismatic Hyori while Kim TaeHo PD is just happy that Hyori keep coming up with concepts for him.",

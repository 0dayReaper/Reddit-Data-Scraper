But it is hard to get mad at a person that looks adorable.\n\nedit : Even if you say positive things about Somin, her fans will find a way to think it is negative and downvote you. \n\nSomehow, they genuinely believe her being adorable have nothing to do with her looks. Yet they constantly post about how good looking she is on RM reddit. She is adorable and it helps that she looks adorable. In no way will people adore her as much if she retains her character and look like lee young ja.",

They did a lot. I hope nobody got injuries from that table tennis game. A volleyball isn't for heading! People can even get concussions form doing that. But I'm so glad SoMin showed she can do sports.  \n\nI also find it super cute that KH called everyone as sunbeanim but SoMin with \"Nuna\".

Being lousy at the volleyball game, not being seated when JSM opened the yellow door, turning on the car when she wasn't supposed to etc. I can imagine LKS doing all of these things deliberately for comedic effect. All she has to do is lean into it but it seems she's too wary of being embarrassed and would rather lurk in the background. Disappointing.",

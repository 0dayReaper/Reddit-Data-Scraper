&gt;!------- TopGirl 3 - 0  Giants -------------!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' TG Miss: **BoKyung** takes a sideline kick-in, she calls out to **DaYoung** saying it's going to her but then calls a

botches the first touch, the ball is re-directed to **KyungHee** who evades **MiYeon** with a deke move and takes a rightfoot power shot on target which hits the right post and re-directs in, **Ayumi** was in position but didn't attempt to block the ball with her hands, this goal needs to re-vitalize a Giants team in need of a boost, **YuBin** has just been subbed back in to stop the bleeding (literally) from **DaYoung**'s leg!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' TG Miss: **BoKyung** takes a sideline kick-in with a power shot on target (no goal if it goes in), **Irene** blocks the ball

deflected by **MiYeon** who is acting as the wall to block the direct shot, the ball makes it all the way to **KyungHee** who gets a knee on it but no real control, in a mad scramble at the far post, **KyungHee** tries to get a shot off but **Ayumi** is there to grab the ball from being shot on net, a glorious missed chance!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' GIA Miss: **HyunYi** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot towards the far post where **KyungHee** is situated, **KyungHee** gets a one-time volley redirection but it goes off target by a foot on the short side, **SungJae &amp; SooGeun** comment that if she used her other foot the ball would have went in, another glorious missed chance!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' GIA Miss: **KyungHee** takes a shot on target from a weak clearing attempt from **MiYeon**!, the ball goes low left side where **Ayumi** blocks and re-directs to the wing where **SeoRin** is situated, **SeoRin** turns around, gathers the ball, evades a defender and shoots but misses the target short side!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' GIA INJURY: **KyungHee** goes down with a pulled right calf muscle, **HaeNa** comes in, and strategies change for the Giants!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' GIA Miss: **HyunYi** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot on goal which deflects off of **MiYeon**'s arms (covering her face and not a foul), **Ayumi** tracks the ball well as it bounces in front of her and she catches it!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!20' TG GOAL: **BoKyung** takes a clearing ball attempt by the Giants and resets the TopGirl offense with a pass to **RiNa** who gets passed **SeoRin**, **HaeNa** comes in to help but botches her first touch by letting it roll straight to **BoKyung**, **BoKyung** takes a quick rightfoot shot on target in which **Irene** gets her fingertips on, **MiYeon** who is in the perfect position by the far post for any rebounds, gets the ball **Irene** barely touched drop right in front of her and pushes the ball in with her body for a beautiful goal from the well positioned TopGirl!&lt;\n\nFINAL SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- **TopGirl 5** - 2  Giants ---what a game! emotions, hustle play, determination on both teams, perfect for the Gold medal game--!&lt;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!NatFam v BallaDream, a new field/set is built for this game and it looks great, and slightly bigger or wider!&lt;",

From pointless kicking the ball forward every touch last season, to someone constantly reading the field on both ends in just few months. It's so impressive how her shot, pass and control, tactical awareness improve so much compared to other people on this show.\n\nThe winner are too good individually. &gt;!You could already told how good all of them in last penalty shoot out. They are all very competent at the game.!&lt; You could even argue that this team could beat the previous champion. Kind of hope after many seasons, we can see a tournament between the past best teams on this show battling each other",

When he was explaining positioning to her and the proper distance to keep from the attackers.  And boy did she deliver.  Cannot discount Choi SungYong TopGirl's coach during the Challenge League who encouraged passing rather relying on BoKyung to do everything.  From terrible to playing for Gold in about two years is pretty good.",

Having Coach JinChul as their coach twice really helped her develop into one of the best player in the league now. Coach SungYoung gave her the drive and confidence,a nd Coach JinChul gave her the skills and techniques. What a combo. The team basically faltered a bit when she was not in the game.

Now they are the X factor of  their respective teams, who were always at the right position on set play.\n\nFC WorldClass is all set for next season with the same players. FC Actionista is just lucky this season with the power of HaeIn, but if YooYoung and Dr. StranjiIn do not develop fast, it will hard for them next season.\n\nEven FC Ananconda got a solid lineup this season even though they got to take a break.

The shots were stronger (and keep getting stronger) which caused a lot of mishandling on her part. She will probably need to strengthen her wrist or find another way of punching the ball out. You could see her jumping towards the shot and unable to control the shot. Her concentration was not 100% like Ayumi. She is the #1 GK because her concentration were always on through out the game. Combining that with her skills and \"sense\", she can basically read the shot coming in.",

Having a stable and reliable GK does help the team tremendously with what kind of play they can do. Remember Actionista first season, weak GK affected the team as whole. I do love JeongIn (Actionista) for her tenacity playing with a messed up neck, but we knew every single shot and attempt on their goalpost were nerve-wrecking.\n\nAyumi and Katy do possessed the traits of a good GK, speed, instinct and understanding of the game, while making minimal silly mistakes. Those two goals by KyeongHee in the finals were her beating Ayumi. fair and square. However Ayumi handled the ball well throughout the game. She should have won the \"Golden Glove\" for her performance.",

I have to say though, for two teams that were rated as the worst and 2nd worst in their team infancy, they did an incredible job of growing to this stage. Especially when you look at the individual skill level of the Top Girl players. Apart from Bokyung and Ayumi, you don't really have a team of superstar athletic/technical players, but they all contribute effectively to their tactical vision, whilst going out of their way to compensate for each other's weaknesses. I'm still waiting on Ayumi to play as their '5th' player on the backline to overload pressing teams. I feel like this league leveled up with the WC vs Ballad Dream game, and I think when they start thinking more about ball retention (which will require a more active GK) the league will get really exciting.",

I'm thinking of more of the lines of a traditional sweeper keeper (I don't know what they're called in futsal), where the build up starts up with the GK. Ie. ball to ground, Yubin and Rina off to the wings or in space, Ayumi dribbles the ball forward (it becomes a 3v2 situation against pressing forwards) and also provides a passing option for ball retention if Rina and Yubin are under too much pressure. Right now Rina and Yubin are only looking for these passes fowards even when the lanes are closed off. But yeh these skills will take a while to develop, but its a huge boon for any futsal team that wants to improve.",

First there was deadly morbid silence and shock when it slowly slipped and dropped. Then there was happy relief, because I thought it looked like you could still save about 2/3 of it, and the ladies seem to slowly realise that too. As they were trying to save it by 'flipping the trays back quickly', fear dawned on me: What if they ruin that too? And there you have it with the 'Nope!' meme-sound playing in my head. :D :D \n\nI felt so sorry for MiYeon who seemed to have hand made those rolls while holding tears of laughter back, but thanks to that &gt;!I feel Top Girl played without any tension of a finale right from the start of the match with a banging BoKyung who brought her A game, while Giants seems to be frozen stiff due to the heavy atmosphere in the dressing room...!&lt;",

She stated that her mom stayed up all night to make them or got up real early in the morning (not that great at translating).\n\n  Their strat to flip them back and salvage as much as they could was the worst thing ever. They should've tried to restack the trays upside down to save the top most (actually bottom most trays) trays rather flipping them over quickly and losing pretty much all three trays .",

It's like watching a trainwreck happening and you can't do anything at that point :D\n\nI do feel sorry for RiNa's mom, but &gt;!at least it wasn't entirely wasted as it seemed to help the team relax and they won. If they lost it might have been seen as a 'bad omen' and attracted blame. Which is relatively common in asian culture with the older gen and one of the things that are my pet peaves of my own culture.!&lt;",

It's even more amazing that they were able to win with most of the original members in tact through the challenge league. Beautiful goals scored in the first half and of course to end it all, MiYoun manages to push a last one in with her stomach which made it so much funnier cause it literally felt like time was playing in slow mo. I guess that's why she's Kandalf. \n\nThey really had a complete team. Rina was always ready to pick up whatever shit gets dropped as the leader. BoKyung was their reliable go-to striker, Yubin the wall and build up, Ayumi the GREAT (literally Golden Gloves if they gave this award), MiYoun is the wildcard and DaYoung was an awesome sub with a lot of basics down despite little playing time since joining.\n\nIt sounds weird to say, but I really enjoyed their reactions right after the game ended when they won. It wasn't like crazy exclamations or complete sobbing, it was just a group of women who played their hardest and were tired as hell so they all plopped down and congratulated one another. It was like \"yeah, it was us, we did it.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiants did their best, KyungHee literally looked like a professional soccer player out there in the 2nd half, she was going insane. She is leaps and bounds above anyone else in terms of pure athleticism I think. But there was no way she could sustain playing like a maniac continuously with little help, I was literally thinking how on earth does she keep playing like this and then her legs went to jelly. \n\nI missed Hyun Yi a bit today with her charging up in front to strike. I know they probably told KyungHee to take the lead there but I think it took away some of the Giants' essence to me. Irene has not been upping her game at all and constantly looked weak or defeated whereas last year, she was literally like their savior for a lot of games.\n\nI hope they come back next year renewed and have another chance at the finals.",

FC Giants/Guchok and Top Girl started with minimal or no football skills, but with time, hardwork, dedication, they all showed tremendous growth which we all love. Too bad Irene played her worst game this finals, not sure if she was regressing due to being injured, busy with main job, less practice or all of the above. Still Congratulations to both teams! The best team won with very good team work, mental strenth and played perfectly their roles. Individually, they are not that good players, but when they play as a team, they were so effective and beauty to watch. Excited for the next season, hope they all continue to show their growth and improvements. What a story!!!",

There needs to be a way of differentiating the impact of direct free-kicks and corners from the more frequent side kick-ins.\n\nI don't think its reasonable that when a defending side puts the ball out of play, a very understandable safety first tactic in a regular game, then they immediately face the prospect of an assassin like Hye-in or Bokyeong whipping in a terrifying set piece and causing pinball mayhem in the penalty area. I seem to recall Actionsta scoring a couple of goals from side kick-ins inside their own half after opposition attacking moves broke down, but my memory could be playing tricks.\n\nAs an added bonus, it would eliminate the \"touch/no-touch\" bollocks that's skewered a fair few goalkeepers who are reacting instinctively to a ball flying at them at high speed, and also improve the overall speed/flow of the game",

However I feel like teams still need to be punished if they can't retain/control the ball. Purposefully hitting the ball out on your side of the pitch should only happen if you're under immense pressure, like being the last defender against a counterattack. I'm still seeing cases where backline players are still hitting the ball out when they have acres of space and teammates to work with, either due to a lack of technical skill or basic tactical training or even spatial awareness.\n\nHowever when two teams are tussling at the sideline, and the ball amidst the chaos goes out, I agree with you that its just way too punishing for the defending team to have to go against what is essentially a free kick straight after. I wonder how many goals were scored in this league that were initiated by a sideline kick in, compared to goals in open play. Honestly I'd rather a system that promotes goals in open play so maybe like a variation where the ball can't be kicked up in the air from the sideline. Throw ins still feel a little strong for the offensive team since it gives an advantage towards taller teams.",

A throw in would be too much for a smaller field.\n\nFC Actionista's bread &amp; butter is basically kick-in since they always have power shooter like HaeIn and YeoJin. It was sort of punishment for defending team who always kicked the ball outbound, but it made the game one-dimensional. But we saw how improved teams with a solid GK like TopGirl, WorldClass and Gavengers where these shots are not longer threatening, and help them develop a need for a systematic build-up plays. That's why Actionista having problem when faced these teams.\n\nThe \"touch/no touch\" rule do help the players, especially GKs make better and quick decision on the fly. Understandable that few shots got through, but GKs need to learn to read the shot and have better techniques to handle them.\n\nWe saw how teams with systematic build-up play were a threat last and this season. I am sure the coaches and players understand the need to know \"whole\" football play in order to be successful next season. A time of one power shooter is long gone in this show. I think we can expect a more stable and skillful game form every team next season.",

She has REALLY developed as not just a defender but an all around defender. Her impact on the defense and offense was made even more clear when she left due to cramps.\n\nBoKyung: God tier. It's between her, Seogi, He-In and Kyoung Seo up for best player in the leagues, with Heo Kyung Hee on their heels. BoKyung doesn't have Seogi's more advanced dribbling skills but she's now got the S-tier accuracy along with power that Seogi just doesn't have her in kicks. That first goal was just a thing of BEAUTY.\n\nAyumi: She's gotta be the best keeper in both leagues, right? It used to be Irene but Irene just hasn't made the plays to keep that title for a while now.\n\nDayoung: I've said it before but I believe she said she hasn't played soccer before and it's amazing how well she is doing. She would have been the best player who hasn't played before if she debuted in the pilot season. She is just a natural athlete, which as was reminded in the GOalympics special, she was a star in the Idol Star Athlete Championship games. It's not that she's wowing with great dribbling or powerful shots but she is in the right place, connecting foot to ball (good foot-eye-coordination) and isn't making many mistakes. I would NOT be shocked if by the end of next season she has developed enough skills to warrant her being a legit starting quality player. With some basic dribbling/ball control skills, plus more practice shooting and passing, she has a high ceiling.\n\n[This play might be the best all season from anyone.](https://youtu.be/n-PDZguR5SA?t=29) Yubin reading the field as she was up until she got injured, passing it clean, the second pass and then the near mid-field long shot. Whoa. THIS is the level of play that is possible from these teams. I freaking love this.\n\nTo build off of that, way to go to the coach. Putting a strong emphasis on teaching passing and also having a nice, diverse, and well practiced selection of set plays to execute on corner kicks. It's not a surprise the team is undefeated considering how well rounded they are in skills and talent.\n\nAs for the Giants, it was the Heo Kyung Hee show. In the first half she seemed to not be fully clicked in but in the second half she was balling. Unfortunately when they needed her most, after all the hard work she did, they lost her to cramps. Giants got a blessing in Yubin getting cramps but then Top Girl got a blessing right back in Kyung Hee getting cramps. It seems fair. I highly doubt the Giants could have gone on that offensive barrage with Yubin in and healthy.\n\nNEW INDOOR STADIUM! It looks nice. They play on turf outdoors anyways so if the turf in the stadium has the proper padding under it, I wouldn't mind that being the permanent soccer match location for the show. The ceiling looks much higher so goalie kicks shouldn't have to worry about hitting the ceiling or rafters. If the rumor about fans being allowed to attend, it being in a stadium with stadium seating totally makes that possible. But having it be heated or A/C'ed depending on the season, having protection from the rain, wind and beating sun, the staff having it easy not having to deal with those elements and the players not having to worry about slippery turf and so on are all wins. Let's just hope they properly padded the floor under the turf.",

Ayumi making huge improvements from her early days and dominating the challenge league where she became the scary presence in front of the TopGirl net.\n\nI really think their team made a huge turnaround with the guidance of Choi SungYong.  He started them off with a team play style and Choi JinChul sent them in the correct direction with their solid team fundamentals, by continuing where Choi SungYong left off.  \n\nLet's hope the next season gives us more improvements from all teams. \ud83d\udc4d",

They gave up multiple goals due to relatively simple mistakes they weren't making when YuBin was in. One of the worst aspects was RiNa in the second half, post YuBin injury, kicking-in from the far side of the field deep in Top Girl territory. She couldn't kick it to anyone but the Giants players to save her life which at least once resulted in a score being made by the Giants iirc. This is YuBin's job and you saw both before she got hurt and once she came back in (after a few minutes after she got warmed back up) her doing it properly. Long shots with power that go beyond the Giants front line.   \n\n\n&gt;Let's hope the next season gives us more improvements from all teams. \ud83d\udc4d\r  \n\r\n\nI hope we not only see more improvements but I honestly hope the coaches don't get rotated and we get very, very few personnel changes.

I wanted TG to win because their story is just great but Giants winning would have been huge too. OG team, no one wants it more than Hyunyi and the team is the face of the show. I genuinely wonder though if she would have retired if they had won. She seems like the time that will either be a lifer on the show, gracefully retire when she finally wins or gets hurt and retires due to the injury. \n\nI'm excited for the next match. It should honestly be a good one with quality soccer skills put on display. I'm really, really anticipating the new team being debuted to the rest of the teams. I assume that would happen in the final episode of the season but maybe it happens in the premiere of the next season? \n\nLastly, my dear Anaconda... I still pray nightly that the producers aren't fools and that you will be getting some sort of off-season training at worst and at best you get a spin-off series (if SBS can shoot a freaking Shooting Stars dating spin-off they can shoot a suspended team at soccer boot camp spin-off). I need for these Anaconda players to still be getting training so their development doesn't stall which puts them at a MASSIVE disadvantage for the season after next when they return. Not to mention the high likelihood one or more (god forbid Taejin) players retire or get some gig that creates a scheduling conflict with the show that forces them to pull out of the show. You cannot convince me that viewership wouldn't be solid if Anaconda got a spin-off in which we saw them getting training at a soccer boot camp by special guest trainers and them playing scrimmage matches against amateur teams in order to build their team play and get real live game reps which are invaluable. This really prevents being suspended from taking the worst team and holding their development when by being suspended it has been indicated that they need more development than any other team. It's like if your high school said hey, you're the worst student, you don't get to go to school next year but all of your classmates do and you will be moving up grades with them. You'd be MORE behind your peers when you came back than you were when you got punished. It makes no logical sense.",

She did everything at 2 ends of pitch, she tries header, a bicycle and direct shot but as Mbappe does they had a same outcome. Tbh even if she just did the scoring and the rest of team can at least contribute on **completing the pass or set her on link plays** prolly it would be atleast gave them more fortunes.\n\nPlayer of the Game :&gt;! Kim Bo Kyung,!&lt; she **just simply cooked them all,** it was a showcase on how far their prowess evolved. Not only for she can shot, **she is integral part** for link plays and set piece - you can see how effective it was through the rest of the team. She's like more completed version of Jeong Hye In, she got a good one touch, dribbling and awareness.",

Especially TopGirl being thrown shade as they were \"fighting\" for last place with Anaconda.  Look at their progress now, both fighting for gold today.\n\nThat's why it's nice to see continuity with teams and players staying for longer.  You can see development.  The random coaching change is a good idea though to make things a bit more interesting since players can begin to tune them out if they're together too long.\n\nI think TopGirl spending their season 2 finale team dinner money on getting a private coach to train with was a great idea for their team.  And I don't want to discount Choi SungYong developing their team play and technical skills.  \n\nI am overjoyed right now with today's results.  The game was a great showing of development.  Hoping to see the other teams get better too.",

You saw the way that TopGirl played, they were rarely fluster and more calm than any other teams. They stick to their game plan and their positioning on the field always. That is why they are successful and managed to \"shook\" the opposing team by scoring easily during their first half, because they knew that the opponent will mentally collapsed if they played their way.",

The level in skill was wide between her and the next best player.  Now that gap is tiny.  We have many great players.  And also don't forget that PSY is in her fifties and doing great and looking hot on top of that.\n\nHyunYi was absolutely terrible in the pilot episodes.  Literally tripping over the ball when trying to dribble.  \n\nTopGirl as a team were quite bad.  Ayumi was once rated as a low tier goalie.  RiNa barely played because she was weak when she started this show.  BoKyung came in as a \"ringer\" to help TopGirl but they still sucked ass.\n\nThen we got KyungSeo and SeoGi raising the skill level bar to new heights.  They brought in the classic give-and-go play to everyone's jaw dropping astonishment.  No team ever properly used that play and we were getting it every BalladDream game.\n\nSaoRi's development was slow but always on the up tick.  Since WorldClass wasn't relegated to the new \"losers league\" in season 2A, (NatFam and FireMoths didn't play there too) a lot of WorldClass skills deteriorated and they overhauled their team.\n\nEva grew into a stalwart defender.\n\nThe list goes on.  I've watched the whole thing multiple times.  And one of the funniest lines comes early on where HyeRyun throws a joke at a former coach who longer coaches in the League that his team will find another way of becoming last place.  \n\nI need to stop now or the wall of text will continue hahaha",

WonderWoman was the strongest of the newly added teams too.\n\nI think HeIn (Actionista) showed great rise in skills during this timeframe.  And she continues to rise in her skills now too.",

They had a mid season pickup in Joo Myung who had top tier potential if she played again. Unfortunately those two left to pursue their careers. The Lee Jung Eun season is the definition of overpowered. She is Lee Kang In's older sister. He plays for Mallorca and is doing well there. He also had a great showing at the World Cup and was actually a variety star as a cute kid growing up.\n\nIf So Hee and Jung Eun were on the same team they'd be dropping 10 goals per game easy. Actually if So Hee was paired with Seogi they'd prolly do that too.",

So  we will call it Challenge League 0.0\n\nhere they played League games to determine the top three to join the SuperLeague teams of FM/NF/WC.\n\nHere WonderWoman (WW)\n\nTopGirl (TG) and\n\nAnaconda (AN) are introduced.\n\nThe \"losers\" league plays out.  \n\nGT, AC, and GV took the top three spots to re-enter the SuperLeague to battle for Gold once again.\n\nNF wins the SuperLeague 2.0, AC is second place, WC is third, GT is fourth, GV is fifth and FM is sixth.\n\nNow they come up with the official Challenge League/Super League format of having relegation and promotion between the leagues.\n\n5th in SuperLeague will face off 2nd rank of Challenge League, 6th in SuperLeague gets an auto demotion and 1st in ChallengeLeague gets an auto promotion.\n\nhere the SuperLeague 3.0 is \"stalled\" to introduce the Challenge League 1.0 with a new team BallaDream (BD)\n\nChallenge League 1.0 is now TG, AN, WW, BD\n\nSuper League3.0 is on hiatus, to determine who will get into SuperLeague3.0  and Challenge League 1.0 games begin\n\nTG is first, BD is second, WW is third, and AN fourth.\n\nTG is now in SuperLeague 3.0, BD needs to playoff versus GV for the last spot, BD wins and enters SuperLeague 3.0.\n\nSuperLeague 3.0 is what we just saw and they filmed SuperLeague3.0 and Challenge League2.0 in parallel now, so the timing of games is closer and no long hiatus for the 5th and 6th place SuperLeague Teams to find out who they'll face in promotion/relegation.  This is where they added the threat of suspension on the last placed team.\n\nChallenge League version 2.0 just happened, FM first, GV 2nd, WW 3rd, AN 4th (suspended)\n\nSuperLeague version 3.0 is what you just saw.\n\nChallenge League version 3.0 is what we will see with the new YouTuber team (YT), WW, and 2 spots remain still undetermined that will be either GV/NF/BD\n\nSuperLeague version 4.0 will be TG/GT/AC/WC/FM and one spot left for either GV/NF/BD\n\nmind you this could be wrong in some details, this is going from my memory and not an episode guide.\n\nEdit: added version numbers for Leagues to make more sense of the evolution of our favorite show.",

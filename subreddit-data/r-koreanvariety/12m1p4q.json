Perro is WAY too cute!\n\nI also love that we get more spotlight on Yumi. She's a veteran in cooking shows now, haha. The steps she placed to reach the stove is adorable. \n\nAlso, lol at Wooshik joke about how Seojin calculated the profits inside his head each time. He really takes the business seriously. It is endearing.",

I bought stuff to try to recreate the recipe, and then i just got stuck in phase 1 of cooking. I'm here for the drama-free wholesome interactions, food, and Perro. So what shall we have for Friday night dinner? I don't eat much while studying because it makes me sleepy, so after my midterms I'm looking forward to a big meal. Also I just spent 4 hrs thinking about where and what to get for lunch, so you tell me kind internet stranger. Save me from myself and hangry mode.",

Cooking requires soooo much energy and motivation, which I never seem to have any, haha. And good luck with your exams! I'm not sure if it is still ongoing, but you got this, babe. \n\nAh, the hardest question in the world!! What to eat \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I usually go for the cheapest option out of all the options I have. BUT burger is always the safest and best option. You can never go wrong with burgers, especially mcd / burger king. I KNOW they are trashy, but still, the best kind of trash food.",

He\u2019s so profit-driven in a way that is funny but kind of loses some of the innocent charm of\u2026 just the cultural exchange/exposing people to Korean culture and food\u2026 in previous iterations of the show (ie youn\u2019s stay and youn\u2019s kitchen)",

            "comment": "I honestly think this show suffers because Yumi and Seo Joon are not working together - the one scene where they cooked together felt so different and interesting? Their chemistry is great. The gimbap counter should have been inside the kitchen - makes no sense for Yumi to be alone in the main dining area... \n\nI also thought it was a bit shoddy when Wooshik cooked the spicy pork rice, he just dumped it all in the bowl - no lettuce etc - because he saw people were waiting to eat together. From what I have noted in previous seasons, Yumi and Seo Joon take pride in what they present to the guests and are meticulous in the prep. \n\nI still really like the show and it is comforting in a way? But I have just rewatched the previous seasons and the charm was different.",

I personally think they should get a female cast, I'm neither a fan or a hater but Tae Hyung addition just not that great. He get so much ease to the point why bother. And feel bad for Wooshik too, he's honestly one of the key player yet he became the punching bag of the group.",

Amazon would not have picked up the show otherwise..\n\nYou can't have Yumi's counter inside.. that would literally just leave 2 people outside.. no color.. atleast right now it feels there are more people than just the boss and the head waiter\n\nWooshik is literally the biggest player in this show.. content wise.. cooking team is literally just caught up in cooking\n\nClearly, conscious decision that V should not come out else fans will hoard.. but he is not really adding much in the kitchen either in terms of content... i can compare this to Kang's kitchen.. being outside where customers are... is just so much more lively, active, more stuff.. V's potenital is wasted\n\n**********\n2 people who don't and won't interact with customers are Seo Jun and Yumi.. they should be put in the kitchen (but then kitchen will be boring)",

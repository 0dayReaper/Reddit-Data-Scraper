stated that since her hands should be blocking only her face and not above it the foul is called, a direct free-kick up close just on the line of the 16yard box (which really is not 16yards away)!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!15' TG GOAL: **BoKyung** takes the direct free-kick to near perfection with a quick power pass to an open **MiYeon** who perfectly redirects it on net with power, **MiYeon** with

and shoots it on target, **Kathy** saves the initial shot but bobbles it, **BoKyung** pouncing for a rebound is there but **Kathy** regains control of the bobbled ball!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!20' WC GOAL: **Ayumi** roll passes to **BoKyung** to her right, **BoKyung** has a brain fart and passes a weak ball to the middle, **SaoRi** sees this mistake and pounces on the perfectly laid pass and shoots left side and low, no chance for **Ayumi** to make a save, literally the ball **BoKyung** gave was a gift pass that **SaoRi** accepted and finished perfectly, INSANITY, they are back in it with a tie game, time was ticking down fast another miracle for World Class, final whistle blows after their celebration!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!incoming **SHOOT-OUT**  scored is tied at 2-2 with the

            "comment": "It was an amazing game with two teams that know how to play football properly. It was a game between two of the best goalkeepers in the league. It was a game between two of the best defending core of the league. All the excitement until the last second were on full displayed in this game.\n\nAs expected, both teams played a stable buildup offense and a balance zone defense. Both team were coached very well and prepared to handle their opponent accordingly. There were no wild shots like previous games as all of the attacking opportunities were part of each of the team game plans. It was a beautifully crafted game by both teams. It would have made a great final, but that is not possible, so we got this game as a present.\n\nFC TopGirl played with a confidence that took them out of the Challenge League and made the the undefeated team this season. It is proven once again why Ayumi is the best goalkeeper this season. Albeit she was lucky a few times, she did blocked a few critical chances of goal by Saori and Naty. This game showed how Rina is the core of TG team. They were shaken whenever she was not in play. This is because DaYoung was still \"far behind\" her teammates in term of skills that can provide some kind of safety net for this team. Miyoun improved tremendously and now her \"magic\" is lethal. Too bad that BoKyoung was a bit under the weather, she was a threatening force for opposing team. Yubin was as stable as always as the second leader if the team. They managed to withstand the attacking pressing of WorldClass who were fast. Only without Rina in the lineup, we can see the weakness of TopGirl. It was an unbelievable feat to advance from the Challenge League to Super League and will be playing in the final as an undefeated team this season. \n\nFC WorldClass was a well balanced, fast and skilled offensive teams again, with Saori and Naty. They have leveled up their skills, ball controls, aggressiveness and speeds. We got to see Lara improvement with her kicking, but she is still not \"good\" enough to handle their defensive side. Often times she was out maneuvered by the opposing attacking players, just like through out the season. She is not physical enough and fast enough to close out the attacking lane. Kathy went back to her old-self as a balance and aggressive goalkeeper. Eva and Elody were as stable as they were as the WC defensive core. It is too bad that they will play for the 3rd place again this season.\n\nAgain it was a great game between two of the best team this season, and two of my favorites team also.",

Also low-key seeing people praise Rina makes me so happy, as her endurance despite her age, and her over-all progression make her one of the most inspiring players on the show for me.!&lt;\n\nA major bummer that the entertainment awards ended up spoiling the results though. It took a lot of excitement out of the game for me &gt;!(especially during PKs) !&lt;.",

            "comment": "It's one of those games where the thrilling moments are rare but so are the embarrassing or boring moments. They are two high level, evenly matched teams on both offense and defense so a lot of the game was stalemated. \n\nOn that end of the game game-tying goal... man. If I'm the coach seeing, from the start of the game, World Class press (fore-check) on every keeper throw in, then I am at the VERY LEAST telling my team (Top Girl) to stop throwing it in to the defenders and to start throwing it or kicking it to mid field. Why? To prevent a mistake like what happened when the players are low energy and losing focus. Of course that's ultimately on Bokyung but I put that on the coach. Scream at Ayumi to kick it deep knowing there's &lt;30 seconds left if not &lt;10 seconds (turns out there were &lt;5 seconds left). \n\nMiyoun getting her first ever goal, and it was clean AF at that, is really cool. Her development is just as obvious as Hyunyi's from where they started to where they are at. All because of a ton of private training, massive respect. \n\nIf anything it's wild that as each game is televised the competitive advantage Bokyung has had from her prior soccer experience is reducing. Other players are developing and so far I haven't seen that much development from her compared to her first few games. I'm sure she has improved some but with her head start I would expect her to be a little more Seogi-like by now. \n\nI feel like this game showed Saori has developed well too. I felt for a while that she started off hot because of her speed then as defenders quickly developed, as defensive play is quickest to develop, she became fairly ineffective for a long time. But now her ball skills and basic passing and shooting skills are all looking good. \n\nI just can't with Dayoung. She is the epitome of cute, with those pig tails and glued to the hip of the coach. Lol. And yet when she is not only doesn't seem to make nearly as many mistakes as you'd expect from a newbie but she seems to often be in the right place at the right time and do the right thing. She's lightyears better than almost everyone new to soccer in season 1.",

What surprises me the most is RiNa leading her team to success. Even though she was taking breaks from injury and rest she was a steady presence for her team.\n\nThis is why I love TopGirl.  They sucked so hard when they started and they're putting all their skills, efforts, dedication, and teamwork all together and finding great results.\n\nAyumi crying tears of relief and joy because of the pressure she put on herself for not feeling like she's been pulling her own weight in terms of training shows the team focus each player has.\n\nEven YuBin brushing off an own goal with jokes during halftime lightening the mood to get her teammates relaxed and laughing.\n\nThis team and Gaevengers are my faves not for their playing abilities but their comraderie.  The closer a team is the higher the  accountability and the responsibility for each other.  This is what makes championship teams.",

Through practice and dedication, not only they build up their skills, also the understanding of the game and strengthen their physical and mental too.\n\nMiYoun has always been good at positioning since the first season. That's why they named her \"Gandalf\". It was just she was so weak physically to handle a match. This was true with RiNa too. Their skills and football sense were there in the beginning, but their bodies could not able to do anything. Now they are fairly fit and skilled  to be able to play the way that they understood and wanted to.\n\nSame goes with their mentality, they were so confident about their style of play and skills, that the own goal on the first half and constant forward pressure by Naori duo did not faze them as much. Of course it help to have a crazy instinctive good goalkeeper like Ayumi.\n\nTheir relationship with each other and commitments to the team also help they progressed tremendously. The same can be said with FC Gavengers last season when we look at the other teams last season. Each players played their roles and trust their teammates to carry out their roles.\n\nMiYoun's goals were clean and perfect. RiNa leadership can't be denied because we could see how it affected the team plays when she was not playing. These two were the weakest when they first started. \"We are just breathing\" both of them said during their casting interviews. Now look at them and look at the team. Undefeated and playing for the final. Rooting for FC Top Girl to be an undefeated champion this season.",

KyungHee is a force to be reckon with now. With her physicality and HyunYi crazy power, TG will have to play a perfect, no mistake and tight defense. Rina and Yubin will need to be a bit more aggressive and played the way the played in this game, which were balance and with confidence. GC defense is weaker than TG offensive power which was proven in their previous encounter. BoKyoung will be able to move freely with her speed and skills. I think the only way GuCheok can defend against a more skill TopGirls, is to bring KyungHee back a bit as third middle defender. If Rina and BoKyoung are 100% healthy, they can definitely beat GuCheok. Also TopGirl need to upgrade Dayoung as quickly and as much as they can for the final to provide some relief for the team. FC Gucheok has a more stable and skilled 6th man in SeoRin. It is about time that her efforts will be pay off.",

See how far they dropped this season, compared to all the other teams. They were highly overrated since the past two seasons. Gucheok was a strong team last season too, with SoMin and JinKyung.\n\nIt is about growth and improvement of each players of the team. That is why we all watched the show.

That's the worst. \n\nOmg DY is killing me in the 2nd half. She's so much worse than her teammates. The gap Rina leaves when she's off the field is huge.\n\nAwwwww Kandalf's first goal!!! So many first goals this season! Omg top daddy's goal ceremony \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 im dead \n\nOmg ayumi should have done a goal kick at the end!!! Why pass it to BK??? They were so close to winning!!!!!\n\nUgh Ayumi is great at shootouts hope they can still pull it off. Is Rina gonna be able to kick? Ugh she's still limping, poor thing. Omg her kick was so good \ud83d\ude2d. \n\nYay top girl!!!!! I had no idea they would do so well in the super league! What an underdog story! I'm so happy we'll have a new champ no matter what and that it's gonna be top girl v giants! Both underdogs!\n\nI have a slight pref for giants just bc they were there from the beginning but i'll be happy no matter who wins! I hope han hye jin stops by for the final! \n\nNew team announcement next week too \ud83d\ude31 so exciting! 3rd place game looks like it's gonna be a dog fight as well.",

Just needs more coaching/conditioning to learn to get her head up while running with the ball/slightly increase speed and strength. The partnership with Saori  could become serious business.\n\nEva has also become less grasping and handsie in her defensive technique and challenges more cleanly. The perfectly fair textbook \"reducer\" challenge on Bokyung straight from the kick off had an effect on her for the rest of the game. If I was coach Beom, I'd stick the no.21 from the Giants (new player this season, can't recall her name) tight on Bokyeong in the final with instructions to get tight and charge/grapple.\n\nMain issue with the team is psychological. Saori tries a little bit too hard and lacks composure at crucial moments. I wouldn't put her in a defensive wall on general principles; not only to avoid \"mistakes\" like in this match, but to have her be able to pick up on loose balls and counter at speed.",

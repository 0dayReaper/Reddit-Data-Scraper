He  finds himself in a state of burnout and mannerism so he chose to find  his real \"self\" by going to the other side of the world! Kian84  left for South America with only one bag on his back along with Lee  Si-eon, the real brother who ran for him, and Pani Bottle, the travel  YouTuber. \"It can't be more raw  than this.\" A 10-day journey that you will experience for the first time  in your life. From the moment you get off the plane, you can't even  predict what's ahead. This is the three men's crazy trip to South  America!\n\n**Links:**\n\n* [Official website](https://program.imbc.com/AdventurebyAccident): Sunday at 4:30 p.m.\n* [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/745119-adventure-by-accident)\n\n**Cast:**\n\n* Lee Sieon (\uc774\uc2dc\uc5b8)\n* Kian84 (\uae30\uc54884)\n* PaniBottle\n\n**Panel:**\n\n* Simon D (\uc0ac\uc774\uba3c \ub3c4\ubbf8\ub2c9)\n* Jang Doyeon (\uc7a5\ub3c4\uc5f0)\n* MINO (\uc1a1\ubbfc\ud638)\n\n**Torrent:**\n\n|Torrent|Magnet|Subtitle|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|720p-NEXT|magnet:?xt=urn:btih:41eb56ff4edf1de05674cef5f2813d2cfa99ffdd|[Subscene](https://subscene.com/subtitles/adventure-by-accident/english/2957141)|\n|1080p-NEXT|magnet:?xt=urn:btih:d2795609f2b4e3b1903885280e5ee4a5b04c9995|Above should also work|\n\nEdit: A fun episode especially the Masato making segment (&gt;!\"She's eating a lot? She must be hungry? Why does she keep on eating?\"!&lt;) lmao but it truly solidifies Kian as one of my favorite entertainment persona in recent years. It's so endearing how he kept on telling Sieon not to laugh at the process because it's rude for the other people's culture (&gt;!\"Don't do that, hyung. What does that make Mother?\"!&lt;). I love how he's so open to differences and so willing to try new stuff. He's just a very relatable person overall.",

I get why Si Eon would feel disgusted after what he had saw. It's just difference of culture, Kian on the other hand was way too chill about it. Gonna be interesting to see the next episode!",

New Journey to the West also has a travel concept but with games so I consider it more like an outdoor variety.",

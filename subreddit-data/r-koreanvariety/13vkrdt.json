            "comment": "I wish they just released all 10 episodes at once, I\u2019m not sure what the point of releasing the episodes in two waves is but I am hooked!\n\nSome of my thoughts:\n\n\u2022 I felt terrible for the policewoman left alone to defend at the boathouse, but police team did not think their strategy through well enough - if a whole team knew where your flag was, why have three people leave to play offense? I understand it was because they thought they\u2019d be able to take advantage of team firefighter being down two players. But, they didn\u2019t take into account the fact windows could be broken into nor the possibility of an alliance forming against them, which is why they were the first team eliminated.\n\n\u2022 I quite liked the idea of calories burned being their in-game currency. The athletes being almost twice as \u2018rich\u2019 as the other teams was pretty satisfying to see as they initially didn\u2019t come across as a strong team, like team soldier or team firefighter. But it would be interesting to see whether burning more calories and therefore having access to more resources, tools and food could be an upper hand for them later on.\n\n\u2022 Team firefighter is my favourite as of now, and I especially love the dynamic between their leader and Min Seo (cmiiw, the firefighter who chipped up all 30 logs and put out both of the other team\u2019s fires). Min Seo was the real MVP here, she was so badass in the arena battle and did her best to make up for their leader\u2019s injury and it paid off. She really made their profession stand out in this challenge.\n\n\u2022 Loved the quick thinking of team firefighter x team athlete to take out team stunt. I\u2019m hoping they take their alliance to the end but wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the athletes joined forces with the soldiers to make it through another round.\n\n\u2022 Team athlete is now my second favourite after team firefighter and their members are also super charming. Their teamwork during the base battle was great and I loved seeing them use their athleticism and skills, especially the climber and ssireum wrestler.\n\n\u2022 I did initially root for team soldier x team stunt but their pride was quite annoying to watch for me. I understand they were the most likely to win the competition and that they had better strategies, but their pride might just be their downfall later on.  I\u2019m glad team athlete pointed that out too.\n\n\u2022 Team solider not helping team stunt after they were called for assistance was also a satisfying watch lol. I understood why they made the call not to help team stunt because they were already outnumbered, and getting involved might have just made them an even bigger target in later base battles.\n\n\u2022 I\u2019m glad the eliminated teams have a chance to redeem themselves. It would be really interesting if team soldier was the next eliminated team (but I doubt that haha). I\u2019d love to see team police get back at the people who destroyed their base and the hostility between a former alliance! \n\n\u2022 I can\u2019t wait for the next episodes to drop already! I have a feeling team firefighter may be the next eliminated team because of Hyuna\u2019s (leader) injury and team soldier really wanting to get rid of them and take their gas stove lmao. But whether it\u2019s team firefighter or team soldier that gets eliminated, I think both have a pretty good shot at getting back into the competition on the island of defeat.",

This is like running man's name tag elimination on steroids.\n\nFirst base attack\n\nidk why the firefighters kept trying to push when it was obviously 4v2. Even if they successfully bumrushed the solo defender inside the base, the other 3 is near enough to collapse on them and trap them. On the other hand i think team police should have just rushed firefighters 4v2, if they did it fast enough they could overwhelm them before they lose their base, even if they all stayed it would have been hard to fight 3v4 anyway. lmao at team athelete who just survived doing nothing lol. No hate though cause that's the tactical advantage of their base\n\nSecond base attack\n\nteam stunt did well considering they were doubly outnumbered. If they yelled for help a little bit earlier maybe the soldiers could have helped out. I think the soldiers played this one a little too timidly, they have an alliance with stunt and guards so their backs are covered, they could have scouted earlier and if they saw the 8 people alliance they could have just countered athlete's base easily. Either way this just proves that stunt definitely isn't the weakest team like everyone thought during the start.",

But the two soldiers could have easily been eliminated since they were on the ground, which would have jeopardized  their own camp. The alliance could have changed the target who knows, and Team Soldiers didn't even have a building structure like the Stunts. Besides, as soon as the two soldiers came, the judo player started marking them right away. And seriously who would be dumb enough to go against a judo gold medalist LOL. However, I was really dumbfounded when the soldier lied about this when negotiating as if she could not admit to their incompetence. It was a totally sensible move, and they could have just explained it. I am definitely awed by their skillsets and teamwork, but as of now, I lost respect for their character, at least for one of them.",

While I can't speak for everybody else, I was expecting them to back up their big talk by protecting their allies, but they've made it a point to be cold-blooded and do whatever is needed to win at all costs. They couldn't have won the 2v6 (they lost two pretty early on iirc) but they had plenty of opportunity to help out Team Stunt before that but chose not to because they don't trust them (which tbf Stunt was very aggro and also didn't trust Soldiers). It's a VERY valid strategy but you can't do that and expect people to just lie down and take it. Soldiers are very self-aware about that which is why they also made the comment about being villains and winning the whole thing that way. Also, people do tend to root for the underdogs, though in my case I'm now just interested in strong women doing cool things.\n\nAs for the concept of allies, all the teams mistrust each other and there's no guarantee system in place for it to mean anything. In other survival games, there are contracts you can make to guarantee certain aspects of the deal but here, since it's already a team game and you have to gain territory with no way of sharing things, I agree that it is mostly useless. Still, even just having a tenuous alliance can help alleviate things. Communication and organization plays a much more important role than a single individual's physical ability vs another after all.",

Even if the Soldiers just distracted it would have been enough for them to hold.\n\nAs for alliances, I really do agree with you. Like, I enjoy the strategy side of it, sure, but on the other hand it feels extraordinarily unfair when 8 people take on 4. At that point its not really a competition anymore, 4 people would almost never be able to hold off 8 people.",

Sure, 4v5 would seem doable but given that 2 of the 4 are elevated, that leaves the remaining 2 members against 5 others across the vast amount of space below. There was also no way the 2 elevated members would give up their flag and come down to support. The only play I can think of was for the soldiers to attack the athlete's base in the meantime but there was probably a lack of time.",

They couldve radioed the other solder to raid athletes camp for another easy win against another big threat. Bonus, they could announce to everyone that they are sending their soldier to athletes camp and cause some panic/get them to abandon stunt raid\n3.\tletting stunt lose means losing their only legit ally and needing to face off their two strongest opponents alone\u2014which im sure they are realizing now considering their desperation to split ff and athletes",

It was 2 vs 6/7 and 4 vs 6/7 would've at least prevented the overload on Stunts base. Two of them held off multiple attacks until they couldn't and even then they did pretty well.\n\nTeam Soldier wouldn't have won that fight but the point was to stall until the shield was down and then the Firefighters would have to break off to protect their own base, they only had a 15 minute window to attack. With Soldier team having a member ready to take down the Firefighters base, they couldve won.",

(athlete even threatened to). Do you think stunt would have abandoned their posts and come down to help? No, cos that'd leave their flag exposed. So now soldier would have only 2 people back at base, and be in major trouble. If stunt wanted help, they should have shouted for it immediately, not after 2 guys went down. BTW, I wonder if athlete can really move into the treehouse. It's in shambles.\n\n3) is guard even in this game? what have they been doing, chillin? they could have done exactly what athlete did and 4x abandon post with way more confidence.

            "comment": "Woah first ep was pretty great. I was hoping for something different from Physical 100 and this looks to be it. There's just something about surviving as a team in a harsh setting that pumps me up. Was rooting for Team Soldiers before this due to Kkangmi and the fact that I love shows like Iron Squad but now I'm unsure since all the teams look pretty cool. Could do without some of the unnecessary bravado from some of the members though.\n\nEdit: After eps 2-3, I find it kind of unfair that the announcements for the eliminated happen so soon after the deed because that immediately paints a target on their back which makes offensives that much harder. In that case, &gt;!Athlete team!&lt; had the right idea of having an impenetrable defense first and target them later when they're split up and have more area to cover. &gt;!Felt bad for Police team even though they had the worst strategy and deserved to be the first out. Thought they'd get a chance to do something before being eliminated like that. Was also rooting for the Firefighters so that was a disappointing battle and even more unfortunate injury. Soldiers did well but Team Stunt relying on them and then going aggressive against them is defo not gonna work out; also it was bit weird that the Soldiers were so happy about Hyuna's injury. While we didn't get to see much of Team Guards with them being so far away and being a step behind everyone else as a result, it's actually working in their favor even if their alliance doesn't work out. !&lt;\n\nEdit 2: After eps 4-5, I get what the show was aiming for with &gt;!the \"eliminated\" contestants getting a chance for a consolation match. It's in line with what a lot of other survival shows like Bloody Game are doing and it does make things more interesting. While at first I really liked how rough and raw everything felt, there were so many moments during the Base Battle here where I was super worried a few of them were going to get severely injured. Even if they have mediators near each campsite and doctors on hand in case injuries occur, it still feels like a few of them are a tiny slip away from a permanent injury. Even Hyuna continuing in ep 3 felt scary. I wonder if they have substitutes like in Iron Squad where if somebody got too injured or something important came up, they can help keep the flow of the show going and still prioritize safety. I hope I'm just being too paranoid and nothing actually happens. On the plus side, despite how fierce some of the battles got, I'm glad the general sentiment is friendly competition and none of them, even the \"eliminated\" ones looked angry or too upset with the way the show is run.!&lt;",

Like, how quick the police was able to gather intel, how diverse team stunt is in terms of skills (even though everyone looked down on them at first), how firefighters have the best team work, how athletes were so physically overpowering. Team guard lmao i wish i could see their close combat skills.\n\nTeam soldier exhibit the most skills and mentality for this game, and their strategy is always on point. With the way the show was edited (them being the villain), i highly doubt they would win. But i still root for them out of admiration for their cool heads, the way they play it safe and steady, how they moved as a team during the flag pole carry challenge. I would just feel so safe if these are the women protecting my country.",

highlights.**\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~1' WW Miss: **(WW 29)** takes a sideline kick-in with a touch pass for **(WW 23)** who takes a shot on target that is blocked by **(SF 01)** the ball deflects out of bounds sidelines deep in the left corner area!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' SF Miss: **(SF 23)** takes a sideline kick-in with a back pass to **(SF 01)** who takes a shot that misses the target but **(SF 707)** is in position to take a better shot with no one marking her, **(SF 707)** kicks at the ball but whiffs a good connect and the ball goes wide to the bottom right post area but a few feet, a glorious chance missed by SF, all **(SF 707)** had to do was connect on the ball and re-direct towards the net for a great scoring chance, rather than swinging with her right foot she could have poked out her left foot!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' SF Miss: **(WW 10- GK)** slows down the play and calls for her teammates to try to mark a woman, she drops the ball for **(WW 23)** who kicks the ball forward and it's cut off by **(SF 777)**, she controls the ball and then lays a forward cross pass for **(SF 23)** the ball has too much power and **(SF 23)** cannot get to the pass, the ball goes out of bounds deep in the corner area for a sideline!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' WW Miss: **(WW 10- GK)** kicks a high and deep goal kick that **(SF 707)** heads forward with no bounce, **(WW 31)** heads it back to SF territory again no bounce, so these women are heading high balls with weight on them, **(WW 02)** traps the ball and dekes out **(SF 01)** and dribbles down the left wing, then kicks a low cross that gets through the legs of **(SF 777)** nutmegging her and with **(WW 29)** open behind the play but cannot get a shot or re-direction on the ball as her balance wasn't prepared for the ball, the ball goes out of bounds for a goal kick, great chance missed, great cross ball but no one to receive and shoot it!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~4' WW Miss: **(SF 67- GK)** rolls a pass to the right side to **(SF 01)** who one-time cross passes to the centre circle area that **(SF 23)** botches the first touch and brings together both **(SF 777)** and **(SF 23)** to the ball, **(SF 777)** kicks at the ball and it goes to the middle where **(WW 02)** takes a one-time deep shot on target that **(SF 67- GK)** to block, the ball drops to **(SF 707)** who turns around and kicks the ball forward to the left wing for **(SF 777)** who kicks a cross that is in the feet of **(WW 02)** again. **(WW 02)** slows the ball down and gathers it, she takes a rolling shot from the centre circle that misses the target to the bottom left corner area that *(SF 67- GK)** easily reaches over to pick up.  **SooGeun and SungJae** comment on SF being exhausted!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~4' WW Miss: **(SF 67- GK)** rolls a deep pass to the left side for **(SF 777)** but **(WW 29)** intercepts the pass and takes a shot on net that misses the bottom right corner by metres, rather than shooting, she should have slowed it down and waited for teammates to come help, she was in great position to kick a cross!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~5' SF Miss: **(SF 23)** takes a sideline kick-in with a power low cross that **(SF 777)** kicks at but the ball hits her planted leg and re-directs on target that **(WW 10- GK)** easily smothers!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~5' SF Miss: **(WW 31)** kicks the ball to the left wing for **(WW 02)** but **(SF 23)** intercepts the pass, the touch is strong and the ball is moving forward with speed, both **(SF 23)** and **(WW 31)** chase the ball, **(WW 31)** gets to the ball first but **(SF 23)** steals the ball and kicks a low rolling cross that **(SF 777)** takes a power one-time shot on target that **(WW 10- GK)** catches with her body positioned behind the ball, great skill save!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' SF Foul: **(WW 02)** and **(SF 01)** fight for a 50/50 ball but looks like **(SF 01)** was a bit aggressive with her arms and she pushes **(WW 02)** to the ground, a direct free kick is awarded near the center line right wing side, although it looks like **(SF 01)** is tired, she is playing great defense blocking a lot of shot attempts by being brave and standing in the ball's path!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' WW Miss: **(WW 02)** takess the direct free kick with a shot on target that **(SF 777)** heads out of bounds for a corner kick, the SF women are heading power shots and heavy high lobbed balls, great tenacity and effort!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' WW Miss: **(WW 23)** takess the corner kick with a deep back pass to **(WW 10- GK)** who shoots on net but misses by a few feet to the top right corner!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' SF Miss: **(WW 707)** takes a sideline kick-in quickly to catch WW out of position, with a kick forward that **(SF 23)** chases down for a great shot but **(WW 10- GK)** goes off her goal line and slide kicks the ball out of bounds, great read on the play by **(WW 10- GK)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' SF Miss: **(WW 23)** takes a sideline kick-in with a deep cross to the opposite wing that **(SF 707)** traps under her foot, she turns around and dribbles, she takes a shot on net that misses because she ran out of field while she made her turn move and dribbled the ball too deep to get a good shot off!&lt;\n\nHALFTIME SCORE LINE: &gt;!------- WW 0 - 0 SF------------, tie game at the half, both teams are playing hard, SF looks like they are kicking their passes too hard!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' Variety Show moment: **Coach JinChul** pushes **Coach SeokJu** to the half line telling him he's too loud and annoying him, lol!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' Injury Stoppage: **(SF 23)** dribbles down the right wing and is persistent even when WW defenders are waiting for the ball to go out of bounds, she keeps it in play with a pass out that **(SF 777)** is out of position to receive, **(WW 29)** gets to the ball but doesn't have control so **(SF 01)** steals it, it's a battle between **(SF 01)** and **(WW 29)** but **(SF 777)** comes in for some double team action, **(SF 77)** gets the ball and kicks a cross to the top of the 16 yard box area that **(SF 23)** kicks hard at but **(WW 10- GK)** blocks with a slide tackle, everyone checks if **(SF 23)** and **(WW 10- GK)** are okay, and both are fine, a foul was called on **(SF 23)** no card issued!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' WW Miss: **(SF 67- GK)** throws a fast pass to the left wing that **(SF 777)** heads after a bounce, **(WW 29)** gets to the ball and back passes to **(WW 23)** who short passes to the middle for **(WW 02)** who receives the ball and dribbles forward with SF defenders collapsing on her position she manages to get a shot off with her right foot but **(SF 707)** comes up big with right foot blocking the shot attempt, the ball goes out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' WW Miss: **(SF 01)** heads a ball but it skims her head and goes behind her, **(SF 23)** chases down the ball with a bad first touch that **(WW 8)** steals and kicks a short pass that **(WW 02)** one-time shoots on goal that misses the wide side bottom right corner but metres, a great chance missed, looks like **(SF 67- GK)** was in good position to see the play unfold!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' SF Miss: **(SF 23)** takes a corner kick-in with a power low cross that **(SF 777)** re-directs with her left shin but not enough connection to go on target, it skins off her shin and goes out of bounds to the opposite wing side!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' Injury Stoppage: **(SF 23)** and **(WW 31)** get tangled up and **(SF 23)** accidently steps on **(WW 31)**'s foot, **(WW 31)** falls to the ground, no whistle blown, but the ball was lobbed passed to **(SF 23)** who caught it in her hands to stop the play dead!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' WW Miss: **(WW 23)** takess the direct free kick with a deep shot on target that misses the wall and bounces in front of **(SF 67- GK)**, **(SF 67- GK)** misses the save and the ball goes behind her, but it HITS THE RIGHT POST and bounces out of bounds for a goal kick, glorious chance missed!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' WW Miss: **(SF 67- GK)** rolls a slow drop pass to **(SF 707)** within their own 16 yard box, **Coach SeokJu** yells for **(WW 8)** to put pressure on the ball, she runs full speed towards the ball as **(SF 707)** kicks the ball forward and it hits **(WW 8)** on her shins and re-directs towards the SF net but off target!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' WW Miss: **(WW 31)** takes a sideline kick-in with a pass down the left wing, **(WW 02)** and **(WW 29)** are both there and in each other's way, **(WW 02)** takes the ball and back passes to **(WW 29)** who passes it to **(WW 31)** who takes a deep shot on target that **(SF 67- GK)**  and the ball goes over the net for a corner kick, great save and great shot!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' WW Miss: **(WW 23)** takes a sideline kick-in with a cross pass, **(WW 31)** takes a deep one-time shot on target that **(SF 67- GK)** catches easily!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~20 Game Ends: BD is now officially suspended, as any result puts BD at the bottom of the CL standings, we get shots of tears from BD players, Goalies stay the same!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!SF MISS: **SF SHOT 1**: **EuDDeum** shoots with power down the middle , **KiSUm** stands tall and blocks the ball!&lt; \n \nHighlights:&gt;!WW

chance to play for a SL spot, WW stuck in CL, BD suspended, TOTALLY unexpected results, I predicted WW and BD competing for SL and NF and SF fighting against suspension.  HOLY SHIT this CL was very unpredictable, the Shoot-out was insanely tense, great game by both teams but I thought it would be a high scoring game, BD getting suspended is crazy, NF getting good in a short period of time is crazy, WW not getting out of CL is crazy, SF playing like they've done this before is CRAZY, Coach JinChul is the Greatest of ALL TIME!&lt;\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!AC v GT, the battle of the tall women is afoot, wtf HeIn is saying she will be shooting and not passing, KyungHee pulling moves, WTF they showed a 5-4 score? it'll be a crazy offensive game, or terrible goalkeeping lol, I cannot wait!&lt;",

            "comment": "Even though it was 0-0 still a very intense high tempo game. Once again I will say Choi jin-Cheul is the best coach in the entire show to take this team and get them to the promotion playoff is a example of his ability to adapt to his players strength. To go from a defensive countering side with world class to heavy possession style with top girl to a quasi defensive pressing side with streaming fighter it shows how important the coach is. As for Balladream while a lot of knetz are upset that they were suspended while I loved the way they played their bodies needed a break. Since they started they have been a injury prone team, seogi with hamstring and thigh problems, kyoung seo with her fractured foot Lisa with her finger, Ali with breathing problems. They\u2019ve been able to persevere but with the added intensity of the challenge league and with Jong Tae-se turning them into a high energy team it caught up to them. Jong Tae-se is a prime example of coach dogma taking over. You can tell that his time playing in the German Bundesliga has influenced him a lot (using German words, high energy racecar play that is seen in most bundesliga teams) but that does not match balladream and his inability to adapt their playing style hurt them. For premier league watchers to me he is like Marcelo Bielsa former coach of Leeds United, emotional wears his heart on his sleeve meticulous but high energy but so set in his tactical philosophy that he ran his team into the ground with injuries leading to his sacking. I hope Balladream can rest and recharge (I had a feeling that they would be suspended because on all of their igs they are releasing new music and holding concerts) and come back rejuvenated, I think we as fans of the show have to remember that at the end of the day they have full careers that come first and for me as long as they are healthy and happy even if that means they have to be suspended for a minute I\u2019m perfectly fine because they have all given us amazing performances.",

            "comment": "Ah, wrong again I see. &gt;!I was so sure WW was gonna cinch this one but alas Gayoung being injured was unexpected and a brutal setback. More or less glad SF won cuz they have a lot of upward trajectory and a good coach that actually wants to work on improving each individual's skills but seeing BD gutted and having to sit thru that LONG as heck penalties and look dead afterwards was hard. BD off for a season and NatFam being promoted, what a weird turn it all took. Maybe we can at least see them in the FA cup or something since Anaconda's back after a million years?!&lt; Still, I can confidently say given the preview and these CL matches, both teams needed more time to stew in CL because it was a very messy game. In fact, I just can't see any of the current CL teams even making it the semi finals, let alone finals unless they actually work on passing and positioning themselves better. I still see a decent amount of overlap and people just kicking and headbutting balls instead of working as a team.\n\nNext game is the killer. I was so psyched when Actionista and Giants had their semi-finals last season and this being the revenge matchup makes it all the more sweeter. I'll likely end up rooting for Giants since they're my OG fav and Kyunghee is shaping up to be the best player in the league but I really like the Actionistas too (and dark mode, angry He In has my attention) so whoever advances will have my full support.",

This team will get chewed up and spit out when they go up there. I am really hoping for that. I don't know why I hate them so much.\nThis season is truly a weird season. All the best teams were not performing as they should be, and all these weak a** teams were beating them by pure luck. Just drove me crazy!",

Took risks by building up from the back in many different ways and playing in a high line with KkangMi like a solo boss sweeper defender... :D\n\nMy girls EudDeum &amp; YehWon working their asses off defensively and still have enough stamina for counter attacks while using their brains. It clearly rubbed off on JinJeolMi and those 3 basically 'barked louder' and fought a more skilled WW on even grounds.\n\nMy only pet peeve is that when doing set-pieces if you put a player on far post duty &gt;!teach them just to put their 'outer most foot' against the ball and don't try to kick it with your inner/strong foot. I was cringing that KkangMi miss so hard knowing that she has a very good shot, but just didn't try using her other foot to catch the path of the ball easier. It will more often than not tap in anyway....!&lt; I see so many misses that should be at least 75% on goal with most of them likely to be goals just from touching it.",

You really never know what will happen with PKs on this show, thought Kisum would've saved so many more than she did. Gayoung is so good, the whole dynamic of the game changes for WW when she's on the field. I was really hoping to see her against some of the teams in the Super League, but I guess we'll just have to wait some more. Also, I feel like Heejung has gone under the radar on the show, she's such a defensive staple for the team and has really improved a ton. I didn't realize until they said it, but she's been there from the start of the team and she's played every minute of every game, that's really impressive.!&lt;\n\nSo unlucky for &gt;!Balladream, hope they keep playing during their off time and are able to come back into the league ASAP. Would be a shame to see some of the players stop playing, they have so much talent among them.!&lt; \n\nDon't know what to say about &gt;!NatFam getting into the Super League, really think they won't be able to win any games up there. But who knows, they're the ones who won and maybe they'll come back way stronger than what we've seen.!&lt;\n\nOff topic- really miss the original WW kits.

He won played great for a tiny girl, just imagining her getting more buffed for next season, gets me excited. These duo can be another combo, like Naori and SEO sister. Dieter will need to lose some weight so she can react faster using her feet instead of heavy footed.(I am so sorry for mentioning weight). JeolMi will get better conditioning with more training. Her situational awareness is great, and we're looking at another Yubin on RiNa in the making. KkangMi is just pure beast in this game, just need to mellow a bit, and she will be a great defender/midfield. Streaming is becoming a solid, stable  and complete team like TopGirl.

Kisum is tailored made for team, great IQ and awareness and Illjeuteo has a good reaction on it.

            "comment": "**Thoughts before the match:**\n\n1. I hate suspension (as it is now. If they provided them with a spin-off show to keep them on TV/YouTube and receive training then I'd be good with it). Of course I want ANA back but at the expense of BD? WW? SF? That just sucks. Getting Tae Jin back will be amazing but losing Seogi, Kyoung Seo and Minseo or Euddeum, Yea Won and that team which NEEDS development? or losing Kisum (best goalie on the show), Hee Jung, Amy Park, Seolhee and Gayoung? F that. Way too much talent and fun personalities that add more to the show than just soccer play.\n2. Suspension is proven broken if Streaming Fighter is suspended. Sorry not sorry. Any system that introduces a brand new team and in which they then get suspended at the end of that season is stupid. It's a setup to fail and the worse kind because not only are they setup to fail as a brand new team who would of course struggle their first season, but they desperately need to receive the benefits of being on the show (a coach, weekly training, matches, etc) in order to catch up with the other teams in the league. That will largely not happen if they get suspended. They lose their coach, the show sponsored training sessions and the matches (for live reps). I've said since suspension was introduced that they NEED to PROVIDE for the last place team that gets suspended, not strip them of their developmental resources. You're taking the worst team on the show and just making them even worse while all the other teams get better. It's highly likely ANA will be in the hot seat and likely get suspended next season for this reason. It's a broken system.\n3. However, it's the system that the show has, and so in trying to decide who I'd want to stay and go, I am left thinking due to Kyoung Seo's injury, BD is the team I'd hate least to see get suspended. I would hate to lose Seogi on the show and if the coach really did quit that would SUCK, but SF is freaking exciting and WW deserves to not only still be playing but to advance to the Super League. They are good and would be a threatening team in the SL. The shows best goalie, a good offense and a good defense. NatFam would be a good threat in the SL too.\n4. That Seogi teasing moment was just priceless. Those are the interactions and moments that make this show go from a fun developmental amateur soccer show to a heartwarming variety show where you care and root for the players as people, on and off the field.",

                    "comment": "**Thoughts after the match but before the shootout:** \n\n1. Heartbreaking to watch everyone on BD, including the new coach, tear up watching the match end. That team, specifically Seogi and Kyoung Seo, might love soccer more than any others. I have no doubt they'll keep playing in friendly matches and practice on their own while suspended but still, not having them on a show is just depressing. Follow their development while suspended on the official YouTube (with ENG subs!) or something, jeez. Kyoung Seo must be so upset and particularly heartbroken because she knows if she wasn't hurt she'd have likely been what kept them from being suspended. \n2. This was what I wanted, if I had to pick which sucked the least. Maybe Seogi being so beloved will spark production to do something for the suspended team to get them air time. The suspended team loses their coach too, right? Only 10 coaches for 11 teams, right? That really sucks for the suspended team, not having that leadership and experienced pro (former player with resources &amp; knowledge) who can help bring them together, train and develop them. Lameeeeeeeeeeee!!\n3. The match was disappointing, from a technique and teamplay aspect. With SF playing a team that can evenly match their athletic endurance, SF mainly just ran around like chickens with their heads cut off. While not a *bad* game for her, this was the least impressive I've seen Euddeum play. On the flip side, I think this was the best OneWeekDiet has played. Nothing uniquely impressive but solid, especially that super-save on the mid-range kick that she had to jump to block. We've seen countless times goalies on this show mistime that jump due to a lack of overall athleticism or not have the balance and footing to jump for it properly. She nailed it. If all the playing results in her losing weight like it has for Elodie, but likely coming off even faster, she could develop real nicely into a solid goalie who can move well. Wonder Woman's play was more disappointing just because they aren't a new team like SF. They really need to work on not turning the ball over, especially right away on kick-ins and goal-kicks, and on team passing. I remember when BD (who doesn't do it well anymore either) tore up the show with their team passing. The ball got passed around like a pinball and would work its way up to their offensive players who could take shots. All of these wild random kicks that have the ball flying downfield/out of bounds need to be removed from their play. \n4. I massively expect WW to win a shootout. Kisum is by far the best and most natural goalie on the show and while I just hyped up OneWeekDiet a bit, she is at the bottom of the pack and blocking direct, fast shots, like in a shootout, is one of her big weak spots. Dynamic movement, the knowledge as to predicting where it will get shot and knowing how to use your entire body to block the ball... Kisum has a massive advantage. The shooters on both teams I'd say are pretty evenly matched so it comes down to the goalies. Kisum&gt;Dieter.",

Which I think speaks to some of the kickers, even good ones, not having a smart plan with their ball placement, and with the skill gap between Kisum and OneWeekDieter being shrank when the ball is being shot from such a short distance. So many good shooters like Amy, Euddeum and so on kicking it waist high center of the goal post is just bad. They have the skills to at least kick it ground-level at a corner post. For those going against OneWeekDieter, they should know she doesn't have the movement skills, especially below the waist, to block any shot ground-level at the corner post. It doesn't even have to be a powerful kick to get in before she can react and possibly make a play on it. \n2. Bravo to both SF, who are exciting and have a high ceiling, and to NatFam who just advanced to the Super League. NatFam not only have the most consistent quality of play in the Challenge League but they also have a high ceiling for more development. They will be dangerous in the Super League. SF in the Super League, if they win their next match, would be wild. Who will they be playing against in that match? I don't think SF would have much of a shot playing the likes of the Giants and Actionista but it would still be wild to see them promoted to the SL after just one season. \n3. I was glad to hear Kyoung Seo say \"we'll get better, wait for us\". It at least gives me hope that she has no plans of leaving the show after being suspended. Her or Seogi leaving would be as bad as Song Sohee leaving.",

This game was so full of excitement and it seemed short compared to last week match.\n\nI mentioned last week how FC Streaming was going into the game mentally better prepared than FC Wonderwoman, and did not expect them to be physically superior too. Wonder might be better in skill, but in the pinch they will not deliver.\n\nStreaming came in with confidence and played better for a new team. They are such a newbie with better athleticism and improving with each game. We can expect great thing from them in the next season, barring injuries and players shuffling. Coach Choi once again building a competitive ,complete and stable team. They played with such confidence with the limited skills that they had and overpowered Wonder with physicality and speed. \n\nToo bad that FC Balladream got the short end of the stick, but the most disappointing  thing was FC Gukdae got the free pass to Super League. F\\*\\*\\*, this team is totally not ready for Super League, Compared to Wonder and even Streaming, who may have a better fighting chance next season, Gukdae is just a physically inferior team overall in term of speed and power. Looks like a sacrificial lamb for SL for next season has been decided. Oh how I hate this team.\n\n The good thing is Streaming got a chance to be promoted if they keep going on the uptick mode that they were in right now. All we need now if for FC TopGirl to knock off FC Gavenger, and we will again have Coach Choi jin Chul derby for promotion game. And that my fellow friend will be an exciting game.\n\nIf you still doubt it, just look at the preview for next game. The level of play of Super League is just pure madness.",

We know what happen when they went against FC Wonderwoman.\n\nThey will be the weakest in Super League next season. The best that they can hope for is SeoHyun as a keeper. All around they are a physically weak team with a much slower speed against a more aggressive stable, and experience defensive players on any of the SL teams. MinJi can rush all she wants but if she can't even beat MoonTak and Kassy of Balladdream, her chances are pretty much slimer against SL teams.",

Scoring even those means that the scorer/shooter was well positioned AND got a good shot off or redirection on target.\n\nThe improved play by MiHae and MinJi was great.  HeeJeong becoming top scorer with her garbage goals meant she was playing her position well and getting good opportunities to have a chance to shoot on goal.  SeoHyun shut me up and played brilliantly even tho i think she is better on the field.  SooYeon came up big with defense.  My only knock is the lack of improvement from MinJeong.   Even with all her time on the show her lack of skill and positioning needs to change.  She needs a coach to teach her from the beginning.",

    "postText": "**Heart Signal 4 (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub1104)** is finally here after 3 years.\n\n---\n\nSynopsis:\n\n&gt; Cupid returns for a fresh assault on the hearts of a new group of romance-ready singletons. The group has never met before, but must live together in Signal House. The house rules encourage flirty behavior, but forbid housemates from directly telling anyone that they like them. Instead, they must express their feelings via text message. But there\u2019s a twist: All texts to housemates are anonymous \u2013 meaning recipients have to guess who is trying to make a love connection with them.\n\n&gt; Watching events unfurl in the house is a celebrity panel of love experts. These include returning romance fans Yoon Jong Shin, Kim Ea Na, and Lee Sang Min, all veterans of previous \u201cHeart Signal\u201d seasons. And joining this trio this time around is a fresh crop of star pundits, including OH MY GIRL member Mimi, Kang Seung Yoon of WINNER, and leading psychiatrist Kim Chong Gi.\n\n&gt; This variety TV show series is the follow-up to 2017\u2019s \u201cHeart Signal.\u201d A second series was released in 2018. And this was followed up with Season 3 in 2020.\n\n&gt; \u201cHeart Signal 4\u201d is a 2023 South Korean reality TV/variety show that was produced by Park Cheol Hwan.\n\n---\n\n#Cast\n\nLee Jumi (\uc774 \uc8fc\ubbf8)\n\nKim Jiyoung (\uae40 \uc9c0\uc601)\n\nKim Jimin (\uae40 \uc9c0\ubbfc)\n\n\\-\n\nShin Mingyu (\uc2e0 \ubbfc\uaddc)\n\nHan Gyeore (\ud55c \uaca8\ub808)\n\nYoo Jiwon (\uc720 \uc9c0\uc6d0)\n\nLee Hushin (\uc774 \ud6c4\uc2e0)\n\n---\n\n#Panelists\n\nKim Eana\n\nLee Sangmin\n\nYoon Jongshin\n\nKang Seungyoon (from WINNER group)\n\nKim Mihyun or Mimi/\ubbf8\ubbf8 (from OMG group)\n\nKim Chonggi (psychiatrist)\n\n---\n\n#Subtitles\n\nSubtitles | | \n---------|----------|\nStream | [Viki](https://www.viki.com/tv/39844c-heart-signal-4)\nStream | [KOCOWA](https://www.kocowa.com/en_us/season/77851672/heart-signal-4)\nStream | [VIU Singapore](https://www.viu.com/ott/sg/en/vod/2162396/Heart-Signal-4)\nStream | [VIU Hong Kong](https://www.viu.com/ott/hk/en/vod/2162554/Heart-Signal-4)\n\nAround 9PM for English subs on Viki could be the consistent release schedule, so wait ~10-12 hours after the episode premieres (converting from Korean Standard Time, it's like 9:50AM every Friday, New York Time/Eastern Daylight Time), then the Viki volunteers should have the English/etc. subtitles available maybe before midnight or usually it's available the next day anyway, just like with other Viki shows.\n\nRemember VIU (and KOCOWA/etc.) also has Heart Signal 4 but it seems sometimes they're delayed with the English subs or episode release.\n\nFor VIU access, you'll probably have to use VPNs set to Singapore/Southeast Asia to view their catalog.\n\nOh and Heart Signal 4 (and earlier seasons) is also apparently available on Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, et cetera, but as usual there's some region restrictions.\n\nAccessing Kdramas, Korean variety shows, and so on (basically Viki, VIU, Disney+, Netflix, etc.): https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10fpzhx/overall_thoughts_on_love_catcher_in_bali/j5cmhaw/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/13bmtin/anyone_know_where_can_i_watch_the_below_korean/jjbtnuz/\n\n---\n\n#Past Threads\n\nEpisode|Subreddit Thread| \n---------|----------|\nEpisode 1| [koreanvariety](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/13jo40c/heart_signal_4_episode_1_230517/), [heartsignal](https://www.reddit.com/r/heartsignal/comments/13k6ob1/heart_signal_4_episode_1_230517/) \nEpisode 2| [koreanvariety](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/13q991t/heart_signal_4_episode_2_230524/), [heartsignal](https://www.reddit.com/r/heartsignal/comments/13reoc8/heart_signal_4_episode_2_230524/)\n\n---\n\n**Heart Signal Youtube channel or \ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110 \ub77c\ube44\ud2f0\ube44 channel**: https://www.youtube.com/@channelA-heartsignal/videos\n\nHeart Signal 4 teasers and clips playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFIYUdSkjiCAuWe006VqSTFfaE7rgIHNy\n\nHeart Signal 4 production stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46UmvFNwi9Q\n\n---\n\n**Heart Signal 4 Episode 1 commentary with Heart Signal 2 Jaeho and some other people**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRuQmQUKLvQ\n\n**Heart Signal 4 Episode 2 commentary with Heart Signal 2 Youngjoo and Jaeho, and some other people**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAFSWmQJkhk\n\nGaheun (Heart Signal 3 and Friends) and Jaeho with the Heart Signal 4 house: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86F9hZ-7nxc\n\nJangmi (Heart Signal 2 and Friends) and Jaeho with the Heart Signal 4 house: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAcupLirqOk\n\nHeart Signal 4 Official BGM Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8djlZk6ZeM0\n\nHeart Signal 4 Official BGM Playlist 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avMPSuhEqak\n\n---\n\n**The Chinese version of Heart Signal (\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7) has an engaged couple now**, don't click this link unless you finished Heart Signal 2 (\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b63), oh and it also talks about Terrace House marriages too: https://www.reddit.com/r/heartsignal/comments/13p3qqr/heart_signal_2_\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7,_Chinese/\uc911\uad6d_version_couple/\n\nTerrace House: Aloha State marriage now has pictures: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/13sz4qe/the_aloha_state_ogs/\n\nFor Heart Signal, the original Korean version and some seasons of the Chinese version should be on Viki. \n\nSeason 2 of both the Korean and Chinese versions are considered the best, and now some people also really like the 5th season of the Chinese version. The upcoming 6th season of the Chinese version is being prepared at the moment, it might be out later this 2023 year or so.\n\nHeart Signal 1 (Korean Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/35675c-heart-signal\n\nHeart Signal 2 (Korean Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/36949c-heart-signal-2\n\nHeart Signal 3 (Korean Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/36950c-heart-signal-3\n\n\\-\n\nHeart Signal 1 (Chinese Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/36228c-heart-signal-chinese-version\n\nHeart Signal 2 (Chinese Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/36654c-heart-signal-2-chinese-version\n\nHeart Signal 5 (Chinese Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/38812c-heart-signal-5-chinese-version\n\n---\n\nWith the Chinese version of Heart Signal, it's available on the WeTV/Tencent Video website (has English subs), and also their WeTV/Tencent Video channels on Youtube for free but without proper English subs.\n\nThrough the Tencent Video Youtube channel you'll have to use auto-translate from Chinese/Mandarin or maybe say Thai, Vietnamese, etc. So for English subs you have to check their own WeTV/Tencent Video/etc. website.\n\nViki has the 1st, 2nd, and 5th seasons of the Chinese version of Heart Signal, so you'll have to look for the 3rd (\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7S3) and 4th season (\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7S4) elsewhere.

Then I thought all the fans died as they have gone quiet. \nIt is a dating show guys, and Jimin wants to sample all the goods. Sweet to everybody but at end of the day voting only one.

Like why the panels try to push love line between jumi and mingyu when it was clear as hell jumi was upset with both jimin and mingyu!! Like they couldn't grasp why jumi was upset and mingyu seems to walk on eggshell. Of course mingyu was like that, he knew he and jimin was wrong in that situation. And jimin being oblivious or dumb or act dumb idk. You both supposed to cook dinner but then come home late. Then just cook it and eat between yourself not even inviting jumi. So what if jumi ate already. It is basic courtesy in social setting to be aware. Also if i were jumi, i would ask them already with do u guys usually ate dinner this late or something. No way i would let that slide. So inconsiderate. I just cant with inconsiderate people. The panels are crazy i skip all their scene. At this point, i know they have script word by word they said coz it was all dumb.\n\nI feel really bad for jiwon. That last scene of him reading text. Is it emergency staircase? He seems miserable. It must be really hard for him being an intern. Like they are at the bottom of hierarchy there. Literally treated like robot with no feeling\ud83d\ude2d idk why he decided to join the show. Still rooting for him and jumi tho. I hope we get to see a lot of their moment from now on. Like please have many many date together",

This means a cooked dinner is to be expected at DINNER time and not revolving around their rendezvous. Did they even apologize for being late? I'm speechless. And while they were preparing dinner, Jimin even mentioned that Jumi still wanted a few bites since she was craving something spicy. Then why the hell didn't they call her down after they finished cooking? Why do they both lack common courtesy?!?!?!??! Jumi had to come down herself after mentally preparing to face those two again. If anything she tried to make the tension better by acting cheerful. These two fools don't deserve her. I'm not so fond of the male catfish but I hope he and Jiwon gives Jumi the attention and love she deserves.",

I feel like Gyeo Re can take a week off and I won't notice he isn't around. lol\n\nThe dinner scene pissed me off. Jimin acting cute and shrugging it off like nothing happened pissed me off. She was so immature and inconsiderate. Min Gyu isn't any better. They both knew Jumi was pissed and they both knew they were in the wrong but instead of making it up to her, they cooked their dinner and ate on their own without even inviting the other person in the house. They're lucky Jumi played it cool but if I were her, I'd probably got turned off and will never look back at Min Gyu again. And to think Jumi has been serving them breakfast for two days straight! Tsk.\n\nAnywsy, highlight of this episode is the stare down between the male catfish and Jumi. I was giggling like an idiot. I like the new guy.

As in when you type it like this: [Kim Eana is S-tier, Stray Kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsOOis4bBFg) / \\[Kim Eana is S-tier, Stray Kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsOOis4bBFg)\n\nOh shit, wtf this subreddit has its own CSS design, never knew, I've had the subreddit style turned off for like half a decade or so now.\n\n---\n\nAnyway, these days \\&gt;!text to hide!&lt; is the way to go now as mobile/New Reddit/etc. users be complaining spoiler tags are often broken for them, so ya.\n\nLike you can do this: [aespa - I'm Unhappy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC7OrEx5H4U](/s) / \\[aespa - I'm Unhappy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC7OrEx5H4U](/s) but it doesn't work in this subreddit, lol. It just disappears, you can still see it if you click \"source\" underneath the comment, it should be the second option to the right, after \"permalink\" and so on.\n\nHere's how to make it work for /r/koreanvariety, this subreddit: \\[aespa - I'm Unhappy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC7OrEx5H4U](/spoiler) = [aespa - I'm Unhappy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC7OrEx5H4U](/spoiler)\n\nUsing (#s) also doesn't work: \\[aespa - I'm Unhappy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC7OrEx5H4U](#s) = [aespa - I'm Unhappy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC7OrEx5H4U](#s)\n\nBut typing the full spoiler word does (which again looks like the hyperlinks or when you hide a clickable link underneath the text): \\[aespa - I'm Unhappy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC7OrEx5H4U](#spoiler) = [aespa - I'm Unhappy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC7OrEx5H4U](#spoiler)\n\nBut ya, it's been a while and there may be other ways, some of us used to have to do that (before they made \\&gt;!text to hide!&lt; easily available) in subreddits like /r/Fantasy as otherwise the mods will remove your comments due to spoilers, lol.\n\n---\n\n**For more reality of the crazy world with 47% spherical (see NASA's recent 4-hour conference about UAPs, Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick had an updated chart there and confirmed those super fast spheres without easily explainable means of propulsion being found throughout in the world) UFOs/UAPs/USOs/etc. then click or hover over this spoiler bar/rectangle**: [Spoiler](#s \"Check here if you want some recent grimdark fantasy/science fiction recommendations: https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgressionFantasy/comments/zhfqs4/what_is_the_best_new_progression_fantasy_that_you/izn463r/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/zi75s9/spanish_dark_fantasy_aesthetics_and_settings/izqwwr1/\")\n\nThat one directly above doesn't let you click the links if you are using this subreddit's style, and if you disable the subreddit style then click it, it will just refresh the page (ah that gives me flashbacks to those /r/Fantasy and /r/noveltranslations and so on days), lol. It's these links, for grimdark book recommendations: https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgressionFantasy/comments/zhfqs4/what_is_the_best_new_progression_fantasy_that_you/izn463r/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/zi75s9/spanish_dark_fantasy_aesthetics_and_settings/izqwwr1/\n\n\nTo chill and for more optimistic and relaxing stuff, this is a studying or just audio triggers ASMR list: &gt;!https://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/xtf23y/discussion_asmr_for_studying/iqqc3d3/!&lt;\n\nSo see now the newer (it's some years old now) more compatible spoiler system is easy clicking and allows you to see the text without having to click \"source\" underneath the comment itself.\n\nAnd then this is a multilingual/etc. ASMRtists list: https://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/watnwx/questionhey_everyone_is_anyone_out_there_a/ii3qnyv/\n\n---\n\nYup, hoping Jumi connects with Hushin since the other three male housemates are likely to be choosing the other girls. Like if the spoilers from the teaser videos that Channel A/production team/etc. released, then Jiwon and Jimin will be on an outing where they hug (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95SLY5leyZE&amp;t=69s), and then like Jiyoung will have longing eyes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naY8aypAjbo&amp;t=45s) for Mingyu, and then for Gyeore he'll still probably just be with Jiyoung or maybe Jumi.\n\nJumi really grew on me (in the teasers/trailers she reminded me of WJSN Seola and as others have said, Girl's Day Sojin and so on), and it was unexpected that she inadvertently had that first connection with Jiwon as it wasn't hinted before in the pictures/teasers/et cetera. But she might not be open to a noona-dongsaeng or older girl and younger boy relationship though. Hopefully that ship sails though as yup they look nice together, lol.\n\nDefinitely nice to see more steadfast people like Jumi as it's actually somewhat rare to see them in these dating shows. Usually people just do so much aegyo or like they have this different kind of confidence instead of the sorta subdued one that Jumi has displayed so far.",

The texts they send every night for their love lines are sent to the Heart Signal staff and then the staff forward it to the recipients. They communicate their schedules to the staff or they tell it personally to the other housemates. They can't call each other. The cooking duty was set ahead. They both did not and cannot communicate they're going to be late. The best thing they could have done is be mindful of the time and their responsibilities and not to go home late but nope, they took their sweet time walking around enjoying their \"date\". There isn't much story in it. They failed to fulfill their assigned task and were both inconsiderate to the other person in the house. It's as simple as that.",

I would. \n\nAnd about the dinner scene that made me rage fr. \n\nJimin and Mingyu are not forced to cooked dinner it's their schedule! Jimin literally volunteered to do it bc she said \"she hasn't shown her cooking skills\" yet she's so tactless that she's rubbing it to Jumi that she was with Mingyu having fun while Jumi was waiting for them hungry that she had to cook her own food. \nAnd they didn't even bothered to apologize to her when they are literally late. Man, I'm so disappointed, specially with Mingyu he's 31 and instead of owning up for what they did and apologize he literally tried to make an excuse. \n\n\nDamn that made me pissed. inconsiderate mfs. \n\nAnd don't give me an excuse about Jimin's age when there are other girls who joined the show who was the same age or even younger than her and they seems like more considerate and mature than her.\n\nAnd I'm glad I'm not the only one who's having a problem with Jimin. Knetz are criticizing them for what they did. And obviously Jumi will have more screen time bc she is knetz fave this season that she trends on twitter korea, her videos on yt are doing well. They are defending her like crazy see link [Knetz dragging Jimin and Mingyu to filth pt1](https://youtu.be/jwf-3cawQJQ). I read somewhere that she's the only reason why they watch Heart Signal.\n\nJumi is too kind fr. If it was me I will give them silent treatment i don't care if we only just met three days ago.\n\nMy girl deserves the best \ud83e\udd0d",

This season theme should be called \u201c2 Birds, One Stone\u201d.\n\nHS4 Reality TV Tropes/Sterotypes:\n1) Artist/model participant\n2) a lawyer participant (but female this time, lol)\n3) Cafe/coffee but a small business owner. We really need to stop labeling everyone as a CEO. \n4) college student \n5) a stewardess who wants to change their career. \n6) short hair/big eyed girl participant\n7) masculine short haired participant \n8) the slightly less attractive cat looking girl who has the best/honest personality but in the end won\u2019t get the guy she really wants or any guy. Lmao.\n\nThey really did hit every type of reality show Korean participant type. We are just missing the broke Fitness trainer this time \ud83d\ude02. \n\nOverall, a boring cast. I think the exhausted doctor will be the most desired in the end.\n\nWhat I find interesting about S.Korean dating is that it\u2019s very classist. A car mechanic can\u2019t date the lawyer. A barista can\u2019t be with a tech CEO. In some ways it\u2019s more brutally honest than western dating. Divorce rates are high everywhere due mainly to financial constraints. What they never tell you is that financial arguments stem from who makes the money and how its spent. If you\u2019re from the upper middle class (and above), you\u2019re obviously used to a different lifestyle vs someone who grew up with a lot less money. Sure you can date but after things get serious, the dynamic changes. Suddenly you can\u2019t agree on what satisfies you and what doesn\u2019t. Your friends group changes. Your parents don\u2019t understand you. And you don\u2019t travel. \n\nSo in some ways it\u2019s better to get this dynamic out of the way. Are you career-wise and financially compatible? If not, your risk for divorce is substantially higher.",

                    "comment": "Haha, Gyeore definitely reminds me of my friend/classmate who was supposed to do the Duke of Edinburgh's Award with me. He's a bit standoffish, cold, sensitive, etc. And this is likely due to his upbringing (we were both in poverty and grew up in the hood, one of the most densest neighborhoods in the entire continent) as his father looked like the typical Asian macho man and so on.\n\nNothing we can really do to people like that as everybody deals with childhood adversity/etc. differently. Some people refuse to accept the reason that they act a certain way is because of their neglectful/etc. parents.\n\nBut then again some people develop that type of attitude or mannerism because of bullying or whatever through school, friends, workplace, et cetera. Oh and Gyeore used to be a breakdancer, sometimes people be so rough in that hobby/industry.\n\nRemember, Gyeore said it himself. Hold on let me find it for you. So Episode 2 (around 49 minutes in) when Gyeore was with Jiyoung inside that cafe (the part where Jimin and Mingyu were also looking for plants and so on) and when he fumbled the vibes later, lol. Gyeore said that grew older with society and so ya that's maybe why he's less open to excitement/risks/etc.\n\nSimilar sensitive situation in Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774), slight spoilers but not really: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zex7ys/pink_lie_episode_11_discussion/izcr1ww/\n\nThere are certain books you could try reading if you haven't come across them already as they'll better explain the concepts and inevitability of everything, see below. You'll learn to recognize certain tells, behaviors, etc. and guess sometimes correctly if somebody's through some stuff or not and whether they (un)consciously display it or not as a matter of identity/etc.\n\nPeople build their identities, principles, etc. over the environment they were given.\n\n&gt; Our early environments are often the determiners of the future. There are books like: \n&gt; \n&gt; **The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma by Bessel van der Kolk**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker**\n&gt; \n&gt; **What My Bones Know by Stephanie Foo**\n&gt; \n&gt; **The Deepest Well: Healing the Long-Term Effects of Childhood Adversity by Nadine Burke Harris**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents: How to Heal from Distant, Rejecting, Or Self-Involved Parents by Lindsay C. Gibson, et cetera.**\n\nAt the end of it, we don't really know much of the housemates or cast members, even if these days a lot of them will start a Youtube channel after the dating/cohabitation/etc. show, or even had their own sizable social media following beforehand. And then like they do vlogs or Q&amp;A stuff about their time in the dating show.\n\n---\n\nRemember, there's always an explanation for how somebody came to be who they are right now. It's not always black and white, most things are gray. And sometimes yup the casting directors or producers sometimes mess up with the characters as they choose the looks/specifications/etc. over the actual personality or manners of the housemates. So if anything when they were selecting the potential housemates they should've filtered certain people out if they wanted a specific type of vibe for the season.\n\nA great example of this is Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey (available on Netflix, watch African Journey too). In Season 1 there was this physically/etc. abusive girl and then they cast her for Season 2 again because of ratings/plot/etc. purposes. She eventually fights (she was punching, slapping, etc.) with the director/everyone lmao, and remember they're in different countries, it was crazy. That's why it's a double-edged sword for them, especially if they're always trying to get the housemates to loosen up with the alcohol and such. So yes sometimes the producers cast people for certain reasons in order to produce specific results.\n\nProduct placement or advertisements in dating/cohabitation/etc. shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/1264tt5/why_is_you_just_driving_around/je88b7g/\n\nFor behind the scenes about dating shows (sorta applies to other variety shows too) and where to watch them, some more info: https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveVillage1/comments/13o5u8p/more_people_being_exposed_as_actors_on_japanese/jl75998/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/111tsh6/redditor_who_implied_that_hes_friends_with_nadine/j8gz6m3/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/10ln88y/how_did_they_film_this/j5zo7qh/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/102o7i0/super_junior_kyuhyun_akmu_lee_suhyun_and_kim_ji/j2vb8ee/\n\nMore info on Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81) and other traveling/culture/et cetera shows (like Ainori): https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10pyock/im_just_sad_terrace_house_is_gone_i_miss_them_all/j6rhk67/\n\n---\n\nBut ya I know exactly what you mean as I know a lot of people like that from the hood, lol. It comes with the intergenerational poverty/trauma/et cetera. \n\nA lot of housemates in these dating shows are from middle class or well-off enough families though. But that also doesn't magically exclude them from the toxic behaviors with their family/friends/etc. and so it's really random sometimes.\n\nSome of the others will say not to psychoanalyze the housemates, but yes oftentimes it's clear what type of character they'll be for the rest or majority of the show. It's really rare that you see a major character change in these shows, unless it's like Terrace House where they stay for a prolonged amount of time (in Terrace House it's like 8 weeks as an average stay in the house, forgot now).\n\nThere's also the matter of Gyeore's visuals being the most lacking of the three/four. And so that also plays into the lookism/etc. aspect of real life. It's an unfortunate double standard and so on part of reality.\n\nLike imagine if Mingyu wasn't handsome or a fashionista, his dirtied shoes (when he first entered the house, and in later episodes the dirt, stain, and so on is still not wiped/fixed/etc. by him, rofl) would've been clowned by some people as most of the time people actually have really clean or brand new clothes just to appear in these types of shows. And so by virtue of using his old or regular shoes, Mingyu deviates from the norm.\n\nMaybe hopefully Gyeore has a decent enough storyline as some dating shows have had characters like him and it never really ends well for them. The other three will probably be fine either way as their looks will carry them in life. It's a given that we give more leeway to people that are attractive (it's a genetics/cultural/etc. norm type of thing) and so as long as they are not too rude, or short with temper, conforms enough with societal standards, and so on, they'll naturally do okay/good in life.",

PD should just allocated screen time for panelist and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t need their every second commentary. \n\nI can feel eng subs going to be a mess because the audio is just toooooooooooo busy. \ud83d\ude24\n\nEdit; Done until before panelist discussion because I prefer to wait for Eng subs for that. Maybe because I\u2019m focusing more on audio since I\u2019m watching it raw, all the interjections and background music felt too intrusive, dictating me to feel certain feelings when I\u2019m not feeling anything. Panelist giggling sound is unneeded and not every scene need to be accompanied by background music. It was really hard trying to focus only on the casts and their voices. Every commentary and microanalysis by the panelist were too much in this episode.\n\nComplain aside, Joomi really is the big sister in the house, trying to take care of everyone, do all the house chores, like please give her a break. I\u2019m missing Jiwon but expected given his job. Probably that\u2019s the reason why catfish entered early. I\u2019m not feeling anything with everyone else because they feel so bland and trying so hard to maintain an image. Looking forward to the catfish, hopefully he will add more personality in the house.",

It irks me when they are adoring her simple reactions (when they are normal nothing too overwhelming) but barely say anything for other members like..this isn't \"Jimin and her love life\" kdrama, is it? Not to mention Jimin herself is annoying me a lot because she keeps giving hints to mingyu and then votes for jiwon. Why do you plan to confuse a guy when you're not even approaching him? He's not your sidekick fgs (I'm being blunt but that's a fact). Calling mingyu OPPA several times, asking him to drop you off, you call the shopping you do as a date, bragging about her so called date to jumi so she doesn't pursue mingyu further but at the end of the day she has no intention of dating mingyu. Isn't she being too self centered atp?? She's being an attention seeker all the time. 70% of the ep is just jimin.  Also the way she said \"phew\" and was being inconsiderate when jumi was expressing her concerns. I hate that attitude. That's not how you behave in a social setting. I'm not someone who hates her. This is my first time commenting here because I had to tell this after the past 3 eps. When jiwon voted for jumi the panelists behaving shocked was iffy because you could see the boy was clearly heads over heels for her. Asking her if she would like to date a guy younger than her. It looks more like the panelists couldn't digest the fact that jiwon would choose jumi over jimin..",

I think it's cute how he's attracted to Jimin bc hes so calm and quiet and she's the opposite. He's growing on me. So is Jimin.\n\nWow GR has fallen in looooooove. His face after finding out the intended recipient of his love and seaweed soup would be coming home late \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Omg poor thing as he's watching everyone finish all the soup \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80. And then kim eana calling him a seaweed stem \ud83d\ude48\n\nAre we even gonna see jiwon on this show? He just comes home to sleep for 3 hrs and then has to go back to work for like 2 days.\n\nIsn't opening up someone else's mail a federal crime \ud83d\udc80\n\nYo there's no way i could last til 10 pm to eat dinner. I def would have had at least 1 or 2 snacks by then.\n\nThe panel hasnt mentioned that Jumi and MK both msged each other at diff times right? So MK acting embarrassed when Jimin called him her date in front of Jumi might have been bc he does feel something for her or he could sense she was upset abt it?\n\nOmg Jumi has reapplied her make-up like 3 times after getting home already. I would hate being on tv \ud83e\udd72\n\nLmao why is jimin like legitimately terrified of the new guy? She's acting like a shy toddler. \n\nDoes lee hoo shin have a tattoo inside his ear? I wonder what it's of.\n\nBig hands and big feet? \ud83d\ude48 I did think w his physique and look he'd have a more fitness/sports related job.\n\nLmao \"we respect your privacy\" but we def tore open your canvas \n\nOk im a fan of lee hoo shin. I like his vibe. He also got funnier as he got comfier. Like him asking GR whether he does anything specific to stay so young looking \ud83d\ude02\n\nI thought one guy wouldnt get chosen for a date, or he'd go on a date w the female catfish, not 2 dates for one woman. I wonder who will go out w who! \n\nOmg what a mess, not a single matching loveline! I kinda like MK with JY or Jumi more than Jimin... i'm interested to see how it goes btw MK and the other 2 women. \n\nOmg ok im trying to match the backgrounds in the preview to each pair to figure out who went with who lol. So did MK and Jumi def go out or was it a fake out? The blurred lights behind the window were such a good call to make it confusing! And they did a really good job splicing together the convos! \n\nIt's finally getting interestingggg\n\nI hope the female catfish comes within the next 2 eps or so.",

She also took her time to cool her head off and compose herself before going down to face them. They both sensed it that's why Jimin and Min Gyu became awkward. Jumi just played it cool and gotten over it quickly but she did emphasized it's their turn to cook and that she got home hungry but no one was there. She also straight up asked if it's okay to just prepare a meal kit if it's their turn to cook to make her point clear which made those two more uncomfortable. She was pissed for a moment and got over it but yeah, the show did over dramatised it. I also hate that they angled it as if Jumi is getting catty and competitive with Jimin because of Min Gyu. Tsk. The girl was just HANGRY and what pissed her off was because of Min Gyu and Jimin's dereliction of duty.\n\nThis made me like Jumi even more though. Jumi being the eldest child, she must have been pissed at her siblings a hundred times that's why she's able to bounce back quite quick and didn't make a big deal out of it. Plus her law school training must have taught her not to let emotions get the better of her. She seemed to have high EQ to be able to regulate her emotions that fast and carry herself with grace.",

Do they make dinner for all 6 people then, even though a lot of them come very very late or don't come at all (ji-won)?. Jumi seemed upset, but then she was home the earliest, so I don't get why she was upset. Also why did Jimin told MG \"wait 4 minutes\" before this dinner fiasco happened?",

They're lax about it coz of everyone's sched or not everyone can cook tho. \n\nThe two arrived late, not Jumi arriving early.  We could only assume what Jumi was upset about but as many have pointed out, she comes home to an empty house, hungry and later hears the guy she was just talking about w her friend and the dongsaeng she's fond of being all chummy, who apparently spent the day together, hardly made an effort to cook....",

            "comment": "Love slow burns or relaxed pacing and so even if this was boring (or frustrating) for some people, it actually felt like one of the best dating show episodes in a while. Like it reminded me of Friends (Heart Signal spinoff from 2021).\n\nFriends has definitely one of the best dating itineraries (for a couple/ship) I have seen in like a long time or ever from these type of shows.\n\nIt's during that starry polaroid with wind turbines. Spoilers (don't click if you haven't watched it yet) from the Friends Episode 10 discussion thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/n2g7ur/friends_e10_210428/gwl1fv4/\n\nLike wow, that first half with constant Jimin and Mingyu interactions is definitely gonna be fluttering for a lot of people. Was half-expecting Mingyu to arrive closer to the university entrance and so on for that manhwa/manga/etc. boss panel reactions, but rofl Mingyu too self-conscious. \n\nSeriously, every manhwa or like webtoon always somehow has that university or high school scene where they fawn over a particular girl/boy as they enter the school grounds, lmao. Like they'll be lined up with wide mouths open, whispering, making exaggerated reactions, etc. as the main character or focused character walks to their class or the actual building of the school, lol.\n\nImagine if that actually happened with Mingyu, so many josei/shojo fans would've gone crazy, rofl.\n\n---\n\nInteresting that Gyeore was a B-boy dancer. Man, a lot of us kept doing that type of dancing (who are the newer and maybe somewhat famous crews after Jabbawockeez, don't really keep up with dance news no more) when we were younger. Got reminded of it recently when Seulgi and Irene did some tutting for the Naughty music video back in wtf it was 2020, time flies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCWoUUWwdqg\n\nAs like one of my good breakdancing friends was way into tutting or doing those crazy hand movements too, lmao. I forgot how to do the basics of it now, fml I should take Kpop dancing lessons like ASMR Glow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQU8XRuMvqo\n\nI remember going to places like what Ploopy678 had here for her SNSD dances video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwpI0qEqMCU, man it's been so long since I danced with proper practice, sigh. Wow Ploopy actually does Youtube Shorts now, LE SSERAFIM - Eve, Psyche &amp; the Bluebeard\u2019s wife: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYsBff0j-74\n\n---\n\nWas Jimin trolling with liking Gyeore's seaweed soup and going for seconds (fam like every other shot is of Jimin eating, rofl). Then again, he was meticulous and had a scale to measure everything, lol.\n\nWhat is Jiyoung allergic too, like I've done /r/23andme and plugged it with /r/promethease and it said some stuff about celiac genes and so on. And so unless Jiyoung shows proof later of her problems with bread/etc. then it's gonna be an immersionbreaking factor due to her controversies that are piling up. \n\nLiterally these days you can ask your doctor and so on with DNA tests for specific known congenital/inherited/etc. problems. And then if you use something like Promethease you can guide the doctor to potential issues that may arise later due to such genetic expressions (remember it's not guaranteed, just a possibility, and there's also things like epigenetics where it needs triggers to be more serious or present). Though a lot of doctors don't like being told what to do, and so just ask for the allergy tests straight up because you suspect certain things are say giving you acne, diarrhea, coughing, itching, etc.\n\n---\n\nLike Jimin and Gyeore is one of the most unlikely pairings. Same with Jiyoung and Jiwon, lol. So wonder if she just really enjoyed the food as Gyeore said he doesn't really make it, wait am I dumb, he's a barrista and so he knows how to do at least a bit of cooking, smh I'm so sleepy right now.\n\nFam, when Jimin was so up Mingyu's face at the supermarket (around 50 minutes in), I was thinking of how my local Walmart also has those russet/etc. potatoes in bags just like that beside the onions. Like first I exclaimed out loud but now as I watch it again, wow the supermarkets be so similar.\n\nYo, girls be doing those kawaii closeup talks and I'm getting flashbacks, that's why this episode of Heart Signal 4 probably hits me way differently than other viewers, like holy shit, Jimin as the panelist said, is literally gold material for that exciting (but predictable) flirting/romance/dating/etc. energy. \n\nSometimes I feel like those random dudes reliving their glory days whenever scenes like the various Jimin x Mingyu scenes pop up. Everything is actually so generic or like basic but it still is so much more immersive if you've also experienced those crazy and hard to believe stories. Fml man, this comment talks way too much about me, smh. But that's the nostalgia reminding you of the good days though, so much potential back then, dang it.\n\nBeing able to relate with the characters or situations in the show, really just elevates the experience. Even if it's from a distant past or a desired alternate timeline. Spherical, orb, etc. UAPs, please grant thee thy interdimensional time travel powers.\n\n---\n\nAs another example, Mingyu is hypervigilant with Jumi's reaction when he and Jimin were just eating/chilling downstairs and so on. Like damn bruh, you can see it in his eyes, posture, words, et cetera. Sometimes walking on eggshells around people gets super tiring and so definitely feel for everyone there.\n\nLee Hushin looks maybe better with a buzz cut (seen his pictures/spoilers before on social media). Helps accentuate his angular features, as in underline his intense bad boy or like cold, tsundere, etc. vibes more, lmao. Hopefully Hushin's presence stirs everybody up because some people are saying everything's inactive still. Reminds of me Heart Signal 3 before the catfish came in too. It was literally just Gaheun making moves on the boys and IIRC the others were just relaxing for the most part. And so some viewers got bored and such as it seemed like there was nothing really going on.\n\nBut ya wtf, see this is why you don't cast actual busy people for these dating shows, like they barely have time, lol. Especially for medical residents, like what were they thinking since Jiwon has to undergo the medical industry's hazing tactics (sleepless nights, constant calls, etc.) for the new doctors and so on.\n\nAs in if Jimin wasn't enamored by Jiwon's appearance, it's near guaranteed he'd be on the wayside like Gyeore. Because he has to play catchup every time unless yup he has those 36 hours or so breaks. This is why a lot of us never became a doctor even though we were qualified(?) for it (outside of the tuition fees). They literally overwork everybody and it's accepted because you're doing good/medicine/etc. when in reality it's just the toxic tradition of inducting people because they had it rough before too. Sigh, so much virtue signaling today.\n\n---\n\nBtw, there's already spoilers of the upcoming dates on social media, so don't read the comments with pictures and such. There's also the leaks of the female catfish scenes with certain members and so on.\n\nMy ships be sailing for now, but as we all know, somehow there's random icebergs on the horizon. Really curious about the female catfish though and why they rarely promoted her yet with the teasers, previews, and so on. Like is it because she didn't match with anyone or what. Hmm, I swear the producers better not have spoiled the whole storyline with their trailers/teasers from a month ago, lol.",

            "comment": "Expect English subtitles on Viki/etc. to appear after 8/10/12/etc. hours have passed since Heart Signal 4's initial release on the Korean TV/streaming services.\n\nEpisode 3 of Heart Signal 4 got moved to Friday (today), so the subs may or may not be available earlier. Future episodes will probably be on Friday too unless they change it again (due to low ratings and so on), as such expect subs to be out during the weekend as IIRC it was rare for shows (on Viki) to have subs on Monday instead of Saturday or Sunday. \n\nBut actually that did happen for a while with the earlier seasons of the Chinese version of Heart Signal, as in it would be stuck at about 95% completed subtitles for a good day, like some parts or dialogue were missing subtitles. Still watchable but sometimes key/etc. parts were glossed over. Viki subtitling teams are still composed of volunteer members, so keep that in mind if the subs are delayed for a while.\n\nFor the KOCOWA and VIU subs, expect them to be earlier than Viki but right now it seems that they may be delayed or after Viki, so who knows how it'll be for the next 10 episodes or so.\n\n---\n\nIf you don't want to wait for Viki/VIU/KOCOWA/etc. subtitles (and to get ahead of spoilers), you guys can watch the raw Episode 3 on this Channel A (\ucc44\ub110\uc5d0\uc774\ubc29\uc1a1\uc601\uc0c1) channel (appears like an hour or so later): https://www.youtube.com/@user-sh4gc2fu9i/videos\n\nWait, wtf they just regionally restricted it this past week, lol, so a VPN set to Korea will probably unlock it. This was the link to Episode 2 of Heart Signal 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0IHJ44sQdg\n\nThat video for Episode 2 (from the Channel A (\ucc44\ub110\uc5d0\uc774\ubc29\uc1a1\uc601\uc0c1) channel) has no English/etc. subtitles, but with auto-generated Korean, you can use auto-translate to English/any desired language (it worked last week): https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/13q991t/heart_signal_4_episode_2_230524/jlgihm0/\n\nOh and if you want to watch it live (there's advertisements and other shows around the Heart Signal 4 episode stream), then you can also visit the Channel A website: https://www.ichannela.com/com/cmm/onair.do\n\n**Note the release schedule in Korea: like UTC+9, Korean Standard Time, 10:50PM every Friday. That just translates to around 9:50AM New York Time/Eastern Daylight Time**. So make sure to tune in around that specific time as otherwise you'll miss the episode release and get like a different thing, lol.",

I'm only an observer and consume the content, lmao.\n\nI personally prefer it direct and to the point too, so it's just my damn writing being taken over by OCD, ADHD, or something, as I want to cover everything for say the people that will stumble upon the posts in the future. As sometimes people always ask the same questions and it's like answered somewhere already. \n\nLike people don't use the search bar (to be fair, the search functions on reddit suck, use Google with site:reddit.com added in the search box instead) and it's never really gonna change as that's how people be. Then again, I also like it when people update the information as sometimes sites go down, or shows are paused for some reasons, et cetera.\n\nSee, my typing just digresses over and over, fml lol.",

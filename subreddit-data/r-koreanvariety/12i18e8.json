    "postText": "\"Gambit Game\", a The Genius-like web series has just been released, following a similar format to the Genius.  u/SharpShark222 from Baechu Squad contributed graphics to this project, and I posted a casting call for this project in this subreddit a long time ago, so I thought it would be good to share.\n\nThe cast includes a Jeopardy Champion, a Gameshow Producer, and a Mafia Champion, and the show features original games and wild gameplay.\n\nWhile it strives to emulate the Korean editing style, this is an English series. But if you're a Genius fan I strongly recommend checking it out:\n\n[Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wup3dN6zMN4)\n\n[Episode 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYpxsZzgDPk)\n\n[Episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfkNcDD-pw)\n\nI've asked and received permission from moderator u/ScrewySiu to post this as a one-time announcement; thank you.",

            "comment": "**Repost from the original thread**\n\nI watched episode one and I'll give an overview for anyone who cares.\n\nThe game is played with 11 people ranging from early college students to a grandmother who is a court-appointed advocate. At first I didn't have huge expectations since the game is played virtually. That said, I will say I was pleasantly surprised and will definitely watch the rest of the series.\n\nGAMES\n\nThe first game is a variation of the classic 1-2-3 game that is a genius and its successors staple, but the new mechanics gave it a fresh enough twist to keep the game interesting. Players were given 9 chips with which they can buy any number of red, blue or gold cards. The cards are played in 1-1 matches with the following payouts:\n\nRed: score 3 points if the other player does not also play red blue: score 2 points for both players if they both play blue gold: score 0 points immediately, but if under half of all players use gold cards, at the end, score 6 per card played.\n\nObviously this game still falls to potential kingmaker scenarios given the rest of the rules are the same, but it did at least allow for some interesting plotting. And there was plotting. Some of it worked and some of it didnt, but I appreciated contestants weren't afraid to start the political aspects of the game on day one.\n\nThe Death Match Elimination Match/Duel was also interesting. Players were given a number of times with different values, including negative, 0 and positive numbers. Throughout 10 rounds, the player who played the highest number wins the round and earns points equal to the round number. Players may play any number of tiles each round, including none. Numbers are scored by placing all tiles together. For examples:\n\n1-&gt;2-&gt;3=123 3-&gt;2-&gt;1=321 (-2)-&gt;4-&gt;0=-240 4-&gt;0-&gt;(-)2=40-2=38\n\nThe game ends when a player hits 28 or more; HOWEVER, if the player who hits 28 has any tiles left when they do so, they immediately lose. Ergo, you need to time the \"all-in\" attack carefully.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nI was pleased to see there was at least some scheming and attempts at strategy the first round. Although not all strategies may have played out/were bad strategies, I at least appreciated some players trying to make and execute plans. There were clear cases of people being leaders and followers in the round, so it will be interesting to see how it evolves through the rest of the show.",

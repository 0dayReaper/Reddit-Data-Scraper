    "postText": "What variety shows you would recommend that may be similar in presentation or competition like  \"Please Take Care of my Refrigerator?\" I really enjoy the fast-paced competition that still manages to be fun and light-hearted, and I love getting to know different Korean celebrities of all entertainment sectors and across all ages. Are there other shows you think are similar in feel?\n\nI'm an English viewer, so - if possible - it would need to be Korean variety shows that have English translations and available online (like Viki) or through a streaming service. Thank you!",

The 4th season has Sam Kim and they stay in Korea but they do food deliveries due to Covid.\n\nThey also had a program with the chefs from PTKOMR that go to Italy or France (forgot), and they goto famous restaurants to try to learn from them. (It was on Olive but I don't know if they translated that).\n\nCook Representative: The chefs from that show goes to other countries famous restaurants and they do a 15 or 20 minute (forgot) battle and they try to win over 5 or 4 judges that are usually connected to the culinary scene one way or another in that country or locale. (really liked this one, and I believe there's some parts that are translated but don't know if it's all.",

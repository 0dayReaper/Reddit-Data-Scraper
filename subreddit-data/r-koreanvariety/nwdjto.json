    "postText": "Korean reporter **Lee Jin Ho** is now facing the wrath of the [**Song Ji Hyo**](https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/songjihyo) fans after he made a video where he discussed the reasons why [**Running Man**](https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/runningman) isn't adding a new member yet.\n\nIn the video, he talks about the hate that both [**Yang Sechan**](https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/yangsechan), and most notably,[ **Jeon Somin** ](https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/jeonsomin)have been facing ever since they joined the show.\n\nA point he raised up, which eventually irked the ire of the Song Ji Hyo fans, was that the Song Ji Hyo fandom was responsible for a lot of the hate that Jeon Somin has gotten. He also mentioned that at one point, the hate got so severe, that her family and friends were also getting hate comments and DM's.\n\nThe video eventually made its rounds, prompting the Song Ji Hyo fans to write numerous negative comments and downvote the video. Some even thought Lee Jin Ho was a reporter from Garo Sero Institute.\n\n========================================================\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*  The Reporter video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oqZ2CeAuAw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oqZ2CeAuAw)  \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \n\nThis is kind of example of Ji Hyo toxic fans who always spread so much hate to others and once they have done this , immediately proving it through their action. As all reporter mentioned is all correct !!",

I hate to say this, but I think if they'll face another crisis, like the one that happened after Gary left in 2016, I am sure that they'll not try to bring another member and the show will just be concluded. I really hope that such crisis would not happen but who knows?",

            "comment": "Saw dis comment under the video. dis is such a long read but honestly everything is on point\ud83d\ude4c\n\n(copy paste) \nmonsoon******* \nJi Hyo's screen time had been decreasing on the show since 2014. Those in doubt can look up reddit or dramabeans recaps during that period where there were many complaints from discerning fans about how she should do more. Episodes with active female guests would have Ji Hyo receding into the background for which female guests would get the blame. When the news of a new female member's addition to the cast broke out, a huge section of JH's international fans went up in arms against the decision. They said RM should have \"only one queen\". Even before JSM joined the show and the audience got to know who she was, there was a sizable chunk of the JH i-fandom hating her just because she destroyed JH's status as the only female member. In one of the first episodes after joining, So Min and Se Chan joked about getting hate from i-fans. One of the comments So Min got from an i-fan was that she should have loveline only with Se Chan and not try to get close to the other male members. That was also one reason many JH fans didn't want another female member because it would break their carefully nurtured shipper delusions where all the bachelor members, Gary before he left and Jong Kook and Kwang Soo, were in love with her. Not just that, all the male guests were also in love with Ji Hyo. So, another female member meant that the attention to JH from the male members and the guests would shift. It was something they couldn't tolerate. \nSince RM was in a ratings crisis, Chul Min PD used what he could get to keep the bored Korean viewers hooked on to the show. JSM's spontaneity and surprising variety skills had already made a mark when she guested on the show that year which made her the best choice as the permanent member. Se Chan took some time to settle down since there were already five male members on the show with their distinct characters. Naturally, it was So Min who got more attention. That riled up JH fandom all the more because SM's performance put the spotlight on the elephant in the room, i.e. JH's weak variety performance. JH's i-fandom never admits that JH's variety skills\nare weak, i.e. after the initial years where she worked hard and got the ACE tag, her lack of talking skills (which even guests on the show have complained of) and refusal to initiate any cast interactions, has been the major reason for her lack of screen time. Many of the fans have a cult mentality where they believe that Ji Hyo is the queen of RM and that the other members and the PD have to work hard to fetch her screen time and that Ji Hyo herself doesn't need to work hard to earn her pay. It was no surprise that the hate went to So Min who was accused of being intimate with the PD and being in collusion with SBS powers-that-be. There were hundreds of hate accounts dedicated to hounding So Min and asking her to get out of the show. They started change.org petitions asking the RM team to remove So Min. Anti-So Min facebook pages were set up with millions of followers. The admins of these pages kept on circulating unfounded rumours and conspiracies painting So Min as evil and a sex maniac, using all the tricks in the book to persecute Ji Hyo and get screen time for herself. 99% of the sensible JH i-fan accounts, who should have stepped in and kept these hate accounts in check, watched these events unfold with silent approval. Some of them would react to the hate claiming that though they didn't approve of the hate accounts, it was a fact that So Min would get less hate if she stopped trying to grab more screen time for herself. \n\nThe male members who got close to So Min were bullied and hounded. Haters sent messages to Haha on his instagram threatening to boycott the RM fanmeet in Vietnam if So Min performed along with the cast. Ji Suk Jin got hate messages for posting a group pic without Ji Hyo. Jong Kook got hate accounts dedicated to calling him a playboy for being nice to So Min and ignoring Ji Hyo. They did not spare So Min even when she had to take a break from the show because of poor health. Her brother decided to expose these haters and that is how the Korean fandom came to know of the concerted attacks against So Min. How did RM team respond to this? They tried to appease JH's fandom by trying their best to increase her screen time, Jae Suk tried her best to create new characters for Ji Hyo and the other\nmembers also got the brief to engage her in their interactions. Along with that, So Min was also given the brief to tone down her performance. That is what has been going on for many months now. Bo Pil PD tries his best to highlight JH through promotional articles. Last episode, one of the promotional articles was about JH turning out to be the ACE in cooking impressing Jae Suk with her skills. In the article, So Min was dubbed as JH's cooking-assistant, who had also cooked well and had helped Ji Hyo. Cut to the episode - it was not just Ji Hyo who got the praise. So Min and other members like Jong Kook were also praised by Jae Suk. Who was the real ACE though? So Min who came up with creative recipes time and again, winning Jae Suk's praise. However, the PD cannot afford to tell the truth because he wouldn't be able to keep the fragile peace in the fandom.\nBo Pil PD creates specials for Ji Hyo with So Min in tow because he knows that Ji Hyo doesn't have the skills to carry on a conversation all on her own. In all their recent double dates, the 90s hangover with Suk Jin and Jae Suk, the double date with the singers, it is So Min who carries the conversation and steps in to save Ji Hyo when she cannot step up to the task. For instance, when one of the singers asked Ji Hyo about her ideal type, she went blank and couldn't answer. As the pause lengthened, So Min stepped in and tried to answer for Ji Hyo. In the last episode, Ji Hyo's only notable moment involved going behind Jong Kook in one of the games. Jae Suk, as he always does, tried to highlight it by calling it a backhug. However, Ji Hyo couldn't turn it into something fun, going all defensive and putting an end to the conversation. Other than that moment, Ji Hyo receded into the background while all the other members stepped up and had fun with their roles. If a new female member is added to the team, one can say with 100% certainty that she will outperform Ji Hyo and receive hate from Ji Hyo's fans. Since Bo Pil PD seems to be more interested in avoiding trouble by appeasing the bullies than addressing the issue at hand, I don't see him having the courage to add another member for now.",

Speaking about it is too much responsibility for them. I really am disappointed at this. Especially SJH, as a woman at least, she should be more aware of this and actively try to fix it. Removing yourself from the person doesn't do anything to help them. I actually think this hurts SJH as well, because she seems like a cold person who doesn't care and has a good excuse for when she might get asked about it: \"I'm a cavewoman, I know nothing\". \n\nIt's bad enough that JSM had to lie on the show and say SJH called her the most during her break. (Haha called her on his YT channel, and asked who called her most and she said JSJ.) It's kind of frustrating how similar to how it is on the show, SJH gets a free pass all the time when it comes to this issue. To have JSM lie for SJH to make her look warmer to please SJH's fans who are mostly her haters is just sad to see.",

Some being part of those who threaten Hong jin young before just because people start to ship her with KJK. Man even Haha and Sukjin got raided on their IG, I remember them urging Haha and Sukjin to apologize for what they said/do to Jihyo that is not even that serious. Haha and Sukjin even slightly bringing up how scary Jihyo fans are to the show as a joke lol. To add they are also hating RM PDS, spamming hate on RM IG if they dont give enough screentime to jihyo. They hate female guests who gets more screentime than Jihyo.\n\nWhen they got called out they just gonna pretend innocent. They will likely say this for sure lol \"It is just fans of Somin pretending to be Jihyo fans to destroy Jihyo image\" (something they will likely say lol)",

Probably due to a lot of them thinking criticism towards them automatically means criticism toward Jihyo. Which I can kind of understand since the hate Somin got caused Jihyo to be under much more scrutiny than before and resulted in her getting a lot of criticism for her efforts on RM. But that\u2019s the result of people using Jihyo to attack Somin or directly linking Jihyo\u2019s screentime to Somin\u2019s.\n\nThat\u2019s why you see a lot of them (including the ones who don\u2019t hate Somin) blame Chulmin for the hate Somin receives. Or claim it\u2019s just 7012 fans when most only ever seem to drag Jihyo\u2019s name into situations to put Somin down. They don\u2019t want their reputation tarnished in anyway so they shift blame. I would feel bad for them if the majority of their fandom didn\u2019t spend years turning a blind eye to what the toxic side was doing until they got exposed.",

I am actually more sad because right now, we all know that in Myanmar there is an ongoing protest/ problem in their government. Everyone is asking prayers for myanmar.  But then, you will just see other (majority?of) burmese fans in RM community who are still spreading hate and toxicity online. (duhh! as if the Suicidal DM's to JSM is not enough) but they even created a meme about the most useless things on earth that includes ''Covid , UN , ASEAN, and Jeon Somin'' yes they included JSM on it. What a national level of hate. And I usually see this in any JSM related posts. I just hope there will be a time that they will be called out. \n\nAnyway this is the link \ud83d\udc47\n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=278131234008533&amp;id=101893948298930&amp;comment_id=280693077085682&amp;notif_t=feed_comment_reply&amp;notif_id=1623313816054891&amp;ref=m_notif",

Her more calm demeanor isn\u2019t a bad thing, it\u2019s just who she is. \n\nThen you have Somin who is basically the complete opposite when in comes to energy levels\u2026 but they are being paid to entertain\u2014 so why is her doing her job such a problem for them?! She\u2019s trying to help make the show fun.\n\nOf course she will get more screen time if she is actively participating and joking with the other members. That\u2019s what variety shows are all about. They should be happy that Somin and Sechan helped to bring more life into the show and keep it on air.\n\nWhat these people who send those messages to Somin and her family are doing is straight up bullying and it\u2019s totally ridiculous and unjustified. So sad that they have nothing better to do with their lives than bullying celebrities and their family members.",

I wouldn't take anything away from her efforts during the beginning years of the show. So Min who joined RM when it had become almost 40% of how physical it used to be also complained half-jokingly that she wanted to quit. That is why the members and PDs had tremendous love and respect for her. Many of her victories were scripted. But there is no denying that she was agile and did the best with whatever talent she had at the time. Probably, the PDs and the other members who purposely lost in games of strength also thought it was justified considering how few actresses would have turned up to set week after week in such a physically exhausting format. Of course, it has come to bite them back in the ass as a cult fandom has formed around  that ace title, taking it too seriously.\n\nBut I feel SJH started taking her stardom for granted after a point and stopped trying to improve herself. While the other members worked on their weaknesses, she stayed in her comfort zone and she could afford to do so for some time as she was the only woman on the show.  There were few actress entertainers around, so awards and popularity were guaranteed. I don't think she was a natural at variety, so lack of experience and efforts are also a factor. That is what led to the reduction in her screen time and the firing scandal. Even now, she is not trying as hard as she should, given the circumstances. They keep creating characters for her. But she is not able to live up to them. The only consistent character is Bad JH and that too has become quite repetitive. .\n\nI wouldn't have much of a problem with her doing the little she does if it didn't boomerang on the other members and PDs who work with her. So Min was a newbie coming into an overcharged fandom situation and would have benefited from JH reigning in her fandom's overzealous tendencies when they were just beginning to mushroom. But she didn't and allowed it to continue unabated. There were many opportunities for her to address the hate especially when they went abroad for fanmeets. A few words about So Min in an interview would have sufficed. She didn't. That too could have been excused if she had improved her performance to the point where the others could stop covering up for her. She didn't do that too. So the criticism is warranted as others are suffering in her place for no fault of theirs. She is the only person who can improve the situation.",

Her love line with Gary was funny and sweet although she always kicked him back into line if he tried to take it too far (\u201cbad Ji-hyo\u201d was the best!). Even though she often looked a little dazed, it sort of became her thing, so the cast nicknamed her \u201cBlank Ji\u201d and teased that she could fall asleep anywhere. In an older episode she had to balance on top of a huge jenga pillar while the rest of the cast was slowly removing the jenga blocks, possibly causing the whole pillar to collapse, and she actually fell asleep on top! Also she was great in nametag ripping and a pure queen whenever gold was on the line, single-handedly winning so many episodes with gold prizes that she must have an entire room in her house just to keep her hoard.\n\nAfter Gary left, a lot of that spark has gone out, and it makes me sad. She\u2019s still one of the hardest-working members during challenges, rarely getting sidetracked like the boys often do, and she\u2019s smart and strategic. But I wish she seemed to be having more fun because I miss our Ace from those early days.",

Honestly, it felt like the show might have ended with Gary leaving, and it didn't feel like it got back to being really funny until JSM joined. She is easily in my top favorites in the show.\n\nAnd so is SJH. I still really like her, though she's less present now. Completely agree she was more fun to watch in the earlier years. It's strange because she wants to stay, but it doesn't seem like she's super involved, and it's been like that for a while now. I honestly don't know what's going on with that situation. At times I feel like it's her not participating. Other times it seems like they cut her dialog out of the edits. And other times I get a feeling that some cast members treat her differently.

If they had watched the show for what it was, they would have understood why she gets less screen time compared to everyone else. She wakes up every third episode, does something for 10 minutes and then disappears into her blank mong-ji mode. She doesn't talk to any of the members unless spoken to. In the bus segments which are boring and contentwise, require the members to either tease each other or the guests, she keeps looking out of the window.\n\nWhy isn't this obvious to her many toxic fans? One reason is the way specific content from the episode gets circulated by most of her fanbases. Many of these fan accounts are shipper fanbases. So, Ji Hyo doesn't need to do anything. She just needs to talk to Jong Kook for a second or sit beside him and the fan accounts add lovey-dovey music and tout it as her participation. All she needs to do is hand over a towel to Kwang Soo or a guest and that gets circulated as Ji Hyo's amazing kindness which is not recognised by anyone on the show. All the other clips circulated on instagram are from the old RM episodes where Ji Hyo got more screen time. That cannot be termed as participation,\n\nThere is also a toxic fan-view which sees everything on RM in terms of Ji Hyo. I cringed real hard when Lee Kwang Soo leaving the show became another 'by proxy' Ji Hyo moment. It became less about Kwang Soo and more about Ji Hyo. Posts with questions such as 'Who will take care of Song Ji Hyo now? ' with requests to Yang Se Chan to fill in for Kwang Soo as Ji Hyo's caretaker and appeals to Song Ji Hyo to remain strong - that is all I saw under the leekwangsoo tag for some time. Sometimes I wonder if the show they watch is Running Man or Song Ji Hyo and her butlers.",

So they can spread rumours, but nobody else can talk about the things they have done over the past three years. If this keeps continuing, SJH's reputation will get affected. She should have done something to control her fans when they were going around and hurting her colleagues and friends. At least now, she or her company should issue a statement that distances herself from such fans. If the PDs are afraid of adding a new member fearing backlash from a toxic section of her fandom, she will have to take some responsibility.",

It's understandable that Somin worked harder and create more chemistry with the members. \n\nJihyo should've used that opportunity as a lone female member (w/no female guests/Somin) but wasted it, I don't blame Somin that she took the spotlight it's just she's naturally funny.

I have never had any impression on her. But it is obvious that the PDs built her Ace image so well during the early period of RM. And SJH is beautiful so that helps to court her fans. Unlike Gary and LKS, they have to try harder. It\u2019s surprise me too, as SJH wasn\u2019t part of the original starting in episode 1. But when SJH was added, the PDs for sure did her a favor in building up her Ace image, while guys like Gary and LKS, they gradually shined over the course of the show. I remember one episode, SJH was super popular m, she received lots of citizen votes and RM casts mentioned that SJH was in CF with Gil while Gary was not that popular at the time. When RM went to China first time, the second episode, pretty center around SJH and KJK because of the popularity of the time.\n\nSJH should really thanks RM PDs for building up her Ace image that good during the early day of RM \n\nI still recognize her effort during the early days of RM, she was definitely more active. And SJH is definitely physically strong. \n\nBut I think SJH values her acting career more (I don\u2019t blame her) when she started getting more acting projects as lead actress.",

She still throws herself into each filming even if she is doing a drama at the same time. She is female yet still gets stuck into the male cast and even one ups them at times.\n\nSo many excuses of why SJH couldn't stand out were instantly dead in the water when JSM exploded onto the show. I'm not saying SJH actually does any of what was said above but those were the most frequent comments I used to see the rabid SJH fans throw out.\n\nCan't just blame it on JSM being new since so is Sechan yet he gets a lot less hate. Of course there are other reasons on top on the above.\n\nMyself I find SJH's role on the show fine, never hurts to have a more straight laced member to balance out the wacky.",

This is different from them bullying Kwangsoo because outside of the show, the hyungs actually are very close to Kwangsoo and I do think they guided him alot on variety since he's an actor. With Somin, I suspect the only cast she connects with outside is Sechan because they have a sort of bond going on having joined at the same time. Sadly I can tell Somin is being more and more disengaged these days and many times the show is just the 6 men talking. She does however always try her best when it comes to her individual segments as compared to Jihyo.\n\nI personally think Haha's treatment of Somin to be the most unwarranted for and we all know he's the one that monitors fans the most. You can also see him being the biggest supporter of Spartace and Jaesuk who prolly doesn't know a thing is like ??? because there's no official push from SBS.",

Unless she herself comes out and says she isn't okay with it then we as fans can't victimise her the way that toxic SJH fans do to their bias. The cycle will just repeat itself. I would like to hope that if she isn't okay with it then she can communicate that to the PD and I'm sure YJS &amp; JSJ would stand up for her. We have to remember that Korean entertainment often centers around making fun of one another especially in RM. I agree it's different with LKS compared to making fun of her BUT that's only because of how toxic fans treat her outside of the show. If it weren't for the toxic fans I wouldn't feel as bad for her as I do because one of her character premises on the show is to be annoying on purpose. It's just that people run away with the concept by bullying her for it on social media.\n                                      \nAlso, it's been shown that she is close with most of the members outside of RM not just Se Chan. She attended KJK's shows, he called her on his other show with Haha and Se Chan, JSJ called her on his YouTube show and they speak on the phone a lot, YJS works with her on 6th Sense and has mentioned in the past that she is one of his favourite dongsaengs. She hangs out with Byul and Haha sometimes. Her and Se Chan used to go out drinking with LKS before he began dating Sunbin (which he would understandably stop doing once they announced their relationship). So, I don't think the members treat her badly outside of the show. It is just in the show. \n                                          \nLastly, Haha pushing Spartace isn't a slight against Somin. Kookmin has always been a sibling line whereas Spartace has also been a sibling line but with a hint of romance from the early RM days before Monday Couple took over. I personally don't feel Spartace have any chemistry aside from being the strong/strategic members but if RM push a loveline all we can do as fans of the show is watch, really. I would love more Kookmin interactions especially with Se Chan because KJK looks like he genuinely likes interacting with them but right now I think in response to the years of backlash over SJH's screentime the PD is airing more Spartace moments.

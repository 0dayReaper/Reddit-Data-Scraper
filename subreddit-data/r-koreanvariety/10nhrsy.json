That old lady that stuck her camera right in his face when he shook her hand and then backward walked in front of them to keep filming him close up to the point that she almost backed into a food stall and he had to tell her to be careful. The shocked expression that he stopped her from filming but then you see her running back up to film him later when they stop for a moment. \ud83e\udd26 No wonder he is known for staying home when he doesn't have a show to shoot. The others don't really deal with that but he's so well known and liked all over. Always feel bad for him having to smile through it.  \ud83e\udd72",

The distance to the random location would provide a difference in advantage/disadvantage and then throw out cellphones/GPS navigation. I wouldn't mind a copy and paste of this formula at all. Eating scenes should be an extra that lasts 10 minutes max and had they done this, it would've been worth 2 to 3 weeks of footage.",

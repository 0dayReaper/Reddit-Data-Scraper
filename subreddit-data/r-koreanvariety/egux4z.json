    "postText": " &gt; In his acceptance speech, he thanked all the members, staff, his wife and fans. He said, \"I don't know what to say. Thank you so much. I'm very happy and grateful to receive such a big honor when 'Running Man' celebrates its 10 year anniversary next year. At the same time, I'm sorry that I'm receiving this award by myself without all the members.\" \n\n&gt; While appreciating the guests who appeared on the show he said, \"Out of all the guests that appeared on 'Running Man', I think of late Sulli and Goo Hara a lot. I hope both rest in peace and do whatever they want to do there. Thank you.\" He finished his speech by thanking the viewers\n\n&gt;Netizens speculate that the 'Running Man' team has paid a visit to late Hara's cremation niche. \n\n&gt; https://www.allkpop.com/upload/2019/12/content/281126/1577550363-72103c04-ac0a-4441-84ce-681029277ca1.jpeg\n\n&gt;The picture above shows where the Hara's cinerary urn is stored. In the picture, you can see someone has put Hara's name tag and a shirt that reads \"Running Man\" underneath the name tag. Besides 'Running Man' props, you can see a bulk of letters addressed to Hara, cameras, and her cheer slogan in the cabinet. \n\nCr : Akp",

It's sad they were mentioned on music festivals but also fitting they get mentioned at an entertainment awards where they appear to bring laughter and entertainment to others despite their pain and hate they receive. \n\nOne of the nicest things about Running Man is how well the whole cast takes care of the guests in general. Even if there have been hundreds of guests, you can tell that the cast try to help them shine and welcome repeat guests.",

So it is a great gesture by YJS. \n\nGoo Hara especially was in my opinion a big part of the show as a guest, making appearances from the very beginning. Which is how I became fond of her. So her death still deeply saddens me. \n\nRIP.",

She really worked hard for that show. Remember she's the only one who took the tractor driving license? She's the only can drove it, if I'm not mistaken. When Sulli passed away, I thought of Hara a lot as they both close friends and Hara also faced with some scandal later tried to committed suicide. It's really a shock what I fear become true. Condolences to both of their family and friends. It's really a heart-warming news that Yoo Jaesuk mentioned both of them in his speech.",

She was part of the show and that show was loved by Koreans and also foreigners viewers like us. Yoo Jae Suk remembered them even though the last time Sulli in Running Man also years ago. I don't see anything wrong with KBS does a little bit tribute for her.",

Hara had stopped to be active in Korea for years, she didnt have outstanding career in either solo or variety. Like Oscar would mention past actors, directors, staffs with outstanding career, not some extra from some movie 10 years ago.",

Like I said, it doesn't hurt for KBS hosts to mention her name just for a while during the award. It doesn't has to be a big tribute if something. Just say something nice of her would be suffice.",

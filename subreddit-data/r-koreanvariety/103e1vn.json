For &gt;!Hye Jeong!&lt; she's always there if her team needs her together with&gt;! Lee Young Jin!&lt; they hustling in to comeback but short. The problem for their team in general is **abysmal defense and GK'ing** for obvious reason as new members isn't polished yet.\n\nHence, they crumbled on dying minutes, it might be the &gt;!Actionista defense or GK!&lt; but it's **not the case - if it's working keep exploiting it**, &gt;!Giants!&lt; shown their **good pass play, set pieces and counter attack** VS &gt;!Top Girl!&lt; and they show it here on new phase - &gt;!Song Hae Na's 2 late goal!&lt; isn't a rocket science - it was a identical set pieces. Props to &gt;!Coach Oh Beom Seok!&lt; putting trust and confidence to her by giving instructions in 2nd half *to always stand in front of goal post in every corner kick.* Everyone on &gt;!Giants!&lt; came up great like as always reliable - &gt;!Lee Hyun Hi!&lt;, &gt;!Jin Jeong Sun!&lt; at defense and marking &gt;!Lee Hye Jeong!&lt; and &gt;!Irene!&lt; for crucial save in late 2nd half; even tho &gt;!Cha Soo Rin!&lt; didn't played that much she got the spotlight VS Top Girl. So they're in good shape/morale in Finals.\n\nThe Women of the match here is &gt;!Heo Kyeong Hee!&lt;, literally up for grabs in 2 ends of the pitch. Ms. Everywhere.",

I thought it was generally understood that you could block a GK's view but not outright shove them out of the way, but maybe that's just a gentleman's agreement that wasn't respected in this case.",

He-In's shooting and her passing are, as always, top tier. Kyung-Hee made some nice plays up until she fell apart mentally. \n\nThe elephant in the room, to me that heated moment was what you'd expect in sports, especially from two former ball sport athletes. What is more shocking to me is Kyung Hee's psyche absolutely crumbling afterwards. I can't speak to what it's like to experience that from someone older as a South Korean, or to know you're surrounded by tons of people watching, TV cameras and it will be aired on national TV. But her psyche crumbling to dust from a former (pro? semi pro?) rugby player shocked me. She didn't do anything wrong, as the coaches watching in the stands said; that's soccer. Also as many others have said it's rich coming from Hye-Jung considering how rough and handsy she has been in the past. \n\nIn the second half, it was awesome seeing Hae-Na get her first goal (that isn't an own goal lol). It's nice to see Kyung-Hee put back together, for the most part. I really, really loved He-In's ball skills, moving to the middle then her shot on target (which Irene blocked). That was the level of soccer skill-level we want to see after all this time! Then Hae-Na scores a second goal!! It must feel good to have played so poorly and been a bench player to playing full time, playing solid defense and now finding a knack on corner kick set plays. That's the development we watch this show for. Then He-In's ball skills and shot on target after she got hit in the stomach by the ball, that was another thing of beauty. She had two Giant players next to her then Hyun-Yi moved infront of her, so she cut the ball to the center and took an accurate shot at a difficult angle. He-In is so good. What a bummer that Actionista lost Yeo-Jin, they were such a dynamic duo. Then the game ends. \n\nA really great game. So fun, high scoring, back and forth and up until the final whistle you didn't know how it would go. Loved seeing the former Giants members in the stands (wait I thought you left the show to go study internationally Jin-kyung? lol). Loved seeing Soo-Min grab Kyung-Hee, tell her she was amazing, ask her why she was down, hug her and then tell her she has no reason to lose courage. \n\nExcited for the next game. The teaser had some -chefs kiss- ball skills and passing skills on display that I can't wait to see.",

Just as long as there are no injuries and they fight with grit and determination.\n\nNot sure if you follow any of the women of shooting stars on Instagram but lots of spoilers have been shown there.  It looks like after this season ends there will be a competition with teams merging into mega teams.  Like four mega teams.  Perhaps a skills competition or who knows.

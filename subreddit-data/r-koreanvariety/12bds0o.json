    "postText": "What do y\u2019all think is going to happen after all these auditions? At first I thought it was going to be just some healthy position competition but AJH made some jokes and talked about the members getting cut. He also told the goalkeepers he only needed 2 (which yea they definitely need a better goalkeeper) and the others would be trained for the field but that would make no sense considering their lack of skills. They auditioned so many people and are still doing more auditions so idk plus the fact that the Asian Games are this fall and the Summer Olympics are next year so some of the old and new players will have packed schedules.\n\nWill there just be a lot of players to help with the competitions coming up and injuries? Will some members actually leave? Or will they create a A and B team kinda thing where they compete to be starters on A team?",

The other members not so much.\n\nJTBC Instagram also just posted about their title matches rematch happening in April for 3 straight weeks, hence they will need the full strength of the squad",

            "comment": "I think I agree with everyone, that with the schedule of the players plus injuries, they are looking to have a deep roster.  Also, I do think it was purposeful to change up the formula for a bit.  There are only so many teams now that are near k3-k4 level which is about where this team is.  Basically a really good amateur team.  They can't play teams comprised of architechs and plumbers who are 54 and overweight any more. They blow out the average amateur team, but weren't quite good enough for solid K3 teams. So, I also think that is part of this.  The team was stuck in a weird spot, this improvement in a few roster spots should push them forward to where they can compete against any k3 team and maybe even challenge a few k2 after a bit of growth.",

I reckon AJH wants them to be competitive.\n\nFor the lack of skills, I kinda blame the coaches' training plan tho. Soccer match only is not enough. They need to focus on training, skills, etc.. \n\nFor me the duration for the 3rd audition is too long. The PDs need to do a better job at directing and editing. I kinda wish they film extra episodes for aftershow training or behind the scenes for YT content. \n\n\nTo answer your questions, I do believe the new players can replace the injured players and also prevent any future injuries. In regards to Asian games and Summer Olympics, we need to weigh in the amount of summer and winter sport athletes that we have(active or inactive, and most of them have coaching job too). The competition between A and B teams is a must I think or else they dont have any content to sell.\n\n\n(P.S. Imagine the amount of budget they need to spend with lots of players coming in. Bet they gonna do week 1-team A, week 2-team B, etc.. )",

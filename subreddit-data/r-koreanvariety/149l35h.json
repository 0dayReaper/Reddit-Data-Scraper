            "comment": "The American dating reality shows are very niche and target a specific demographic where as the Korean dating reality shows are more aimed at a general audience. If you compare other types of shows they're much closer in many ways. For example shows like American Gladiator and American Ninja Warrior (based on a Japanese show) are very similar to a show like Lets Go Dream Team.",

I\u2019ve started hating American dating reality shows cause they\u2019re just so\u2026 wild and the men are just scripted to be over the top obnoxious. Shows like \u201cLove Island\u201d (even the UK version) gets obnoxious after the first two episodes.",

That's why the contestants would often act over the top to create (manufactured) drama.  \n\n\nOn the other hand, controversy in Korean reality show is considered negative because it means the public are against them, and having bad enough controversy could also immediately end someone's career. That's why the contestants usually behave more normal. \n\n\nAlso, there's more strict TV regulation in Korea for the shows that air in normal channels (non-cable, non-Netflix).",

Almost 0 sexual tension and 0 physical interactions. \n\nHeart Signal I would say is the most conservative one bc there is a guessing game aspect where the panel has to guess who is going to text who in each ep, so the editing doesn't show us a lot of obvious signs. Season 2 was the best. \n\nThen I would say Love Catcher, followed by Transit Love (TL S2 was the best). LC in Bali was the raciest season bc of the hot climate/beach vibe and they also had an overnight date on that season.\n\nI am Solo is like for \"real\" adults looking to get married. I think 4ish actual marriages have come out of the show so far. So you either get very proper/respectful interactions OR once in a while you get some older divorced people who go a little wild bc it's their first time being away from their kids for this long \ud83d\ude02\n\nIn terms of entertainment tho I would start with TL2, LC Bali, then HS 2, then I am solo (season 6 is the best). If you like dancing I also really loved somebody seasons 1 and 2. It's a dating show just for dancers and part of their spending time together/getting to know each other is choreographing and performing a dance w the person they like. \n\nThere is basically endless content for you to explore lol, hope you enjoy!",

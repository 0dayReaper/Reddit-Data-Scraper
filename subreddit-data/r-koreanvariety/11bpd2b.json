    "postText": "This is just an announcement to some changes that I think will improve this subreddit. (I asked other moderators but no responses back, so I think it'll be fine).  \n\n\n1. I'm no longer making the Weekly Questions &amp; Talk post, since let's be honest....no one really used it and liked it. Everyone still made new posts for things that should have been in there. I did feel bad removing posts since members really asked questions and wanted answers, I was just trying to enforce the previous mods rule and make things cleaner on the page.  \nTherefore, there's no need to report posts by members stating it should be in the WQT post, since it's no longer being made.   \nThe \"Shows of the Week\" post, I will continue to post since that's useful info for some members.  \nI'll let people continue to make posts for suggestions and whatever, but if the subreddit starts to look awful, the mods will think of something or members' suggestions welcome.  \nI was thinking about discontinuing the WQT post for the past couple weeks, but made me finally decide to remove it was when that post was reported and I was basically called a poor moderator. Also, I think someone or a few are just reporting posts because their posts were reported and trolling along basically.\n2. This answers the question about Korean Reality Shows, like Peak Time &amp; Singles Inferno. Although this is a Korean Variety subreddit, I think it's time to allow Korean Reality to be posted on here since a lot of members like it and I don't think there's a Korean Reality Show subreddit, so just add it here. Personally, I think reality shows are somewhat like variety shows and didn't have an issue with them being posted here.\n\nThat's all I wanted to say, but if anyone has any comments or suggestions, just post it below for everyone to discuss.",

The best example was Singles Inferno...so many posts and replies on it here. I didn't remove it because it was so popular and everyone contributed. I personally don't like reality shows, so I didn't really read those threads, but if someone reported something, I'd take a look. Others are usually good at reporting infractions regarding Rule #2 or #8.  \nI know there will be some members pro &amp; con for this change, but for now I'm trying this out. There is a voice for reality shows on here....not sure how loud, but I'll let it be heard.   \nIf it's a failure, I'll admit it and make another announcement about it.",

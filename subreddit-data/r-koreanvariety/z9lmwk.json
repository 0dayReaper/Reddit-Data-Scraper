    "postText": "Transit Love 2 has ended a month ago and everyone knows that it has gotten a huge amount of fans. It has since become one of the most popular dating shows in South Korea and is one of the most beloved. The cast, especially Haeeun and Hyungyu has received so much support.\n\nOn the show, it was revealed that Nayeon and Heedo got back together, Haeeun and Hyungyu are currently dating, and Naeon and Taei are still on the \"flirting\" stage. If there's something I've noticed, the fans has gotten wild and has been looking \"evidences\" in EVERYTHING. At first, it was okay. And what they found was really an \"evidence\" such as them finding out that Haeeun has already met Hyungyu's friends through her phone case + clothes and that Taei and Naeon were together once with Hyungyu and Heedo after he was seen holding her coat and bag. It was fine, it was cute. But now it has been something else. They look into everything, find the locations of the restaurants the cast were in, the shadow, the reflection\u2014 they would speculate for everything.\n\nThere was even a time that some said that Haeeun was with Gyumin in Thailand based on the laugh in the background only for her to be seen in South Korea with the rest of the cast on the next day. Some would even try to find something about their schedule. Heck, there was even someone on Twitter who posted a private IG account and asked if it was either Haeeun and Hyungyu then proceeded to say that don't follow it. \n\nA lot of them are all about giving the cast their privacy, and at the same time, they would do everything just to find their current whereabouts. It's gotten crazy wild.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso, Wonbin has opened his IG account. It's \"binthegardener\" (very appropriate).",

    "postText": "**Heart Signal 4 (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub1104)** is finally here after 3 years.\n\n---\n\nSynopsis:\n\n&gt; Cupid returns for a fresh assault on the hearts of a new group of romance-ready singletons. The group has never met before, but must live together in Signal House. The house rules encourage flirty behavior, but forbid housemates from directly telling anyone that they like them. Instead, they must express their feelings via text message. But there\u2019s a twist: All texts to housemates are anonymous \u2013 meaning recipients have to guess who is trying to make a love connection with them.\n\n&gt; Watching events unfurl in the house is a celebrity panel of love experts. These include returning romance fans Yoon Jong Shin, Kim Ea Na, and Lee Sang Min, all veterans of previous \u201cHeart Signal\u201d seasons. And joining this trio this time around is a fresh crop of star pundits, including OH MY GIRL member Mimi, Kang Seung Yoon of WINNER, and leading psychiatrist Kim Chong Gi.\n\n&gt; This variety TV show series is the follow-up to 2017\u2019s \u201cHeart Signal.\u201d A second series was released in 2018. And this was followed up with Season 3 in 2020.\n\n&gt; \u201cHeart Signal 4\u201d is a 2023 South Korean reality TV/variety show that was produced by Park Cheol Hwan.\n\n---\n\n#Cast\n\nLee Jumi (\uc774 \uc8fc\ubbf8)\n\nKim Jiyoung (\uae40 \uc9c0\uc601)\n\nKim Jimin (\uae40 \uc9c0\ubbfc)\n\n\\-\n\nShin Mingyu (\uc2e0 \ubbfc\uaddc)\n\nHan Gyeore (\ud55c \uaca8\ub808)\n\nYoo Jiwon (\uc720 \uc9c0\uc6d0)\n\nLee Hushin (\uc774 \ud6c4\uc2e0)\n\n---\n\n#Panelists\n\nKim Eana\n\nLee Sangmin\n\nYoon Jongshin\n\nKang Seungyoon (from WINNER group)\n\nKim Mihyun or Mimi/\ubbf8\ubbf8 (from OMG group)\n\nKim Chonggi (psychiatrist)\n\n---\n\n#Subtitles\n\nSubtitles | | \n---------|----------|\nStream | [Viki](https://www.viki.com/tv/39844c-heart-signal-4)\nStream |

they're a bit delayed, several hours later after Viki.\n\nFor VIU access, you'll probably have to use VPNs set to Singapore/Southeast Asia to view their catalog.\n\nOh and Heart Signal 4 (and earlier seasons) is also apparently available on Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, et cetera, but as usual there's some region restrictions.\n\nAccessing Kdramas, Korean variety shows, and so on (basically

Korean version and some seasons of the Chinese version should be on Viki. \n\nSeason 2 of both the Korean and Chinese versions are considered the best, and now some people also really like the 5th season of the Chinese version. \n\nThe upcoming 6th season of the Chinese version just wrapped up filming, it should be available soon, maybe a few more months or so.\n\nHeart Signal 1 (Korean Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/35675c-heart-signal\n\nHeart Signal 2 (Korean Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/36949c-heart-signal-2\n\nHeart Signal 3 (Korean Version):

https://www.viki.com/tv/36654c-heart-signal-2-chinese-version\n\nHeart Signal 5 (Chinese Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/38812c-heart-signal-5-chinese-version\n\n---\n\nWith the Chinese version of Heart Signal, it's available on the WeTV/Tencent Video website (has English subs), and also their WeTV/Tencent Video channels on Youtube for free but without proper English subs.\n\nThrough the Tencent Video Youtube channel you'll have to use auto-translate from Chinese/Mandarin or maybe say Thai, Vietnamese, etc. So for English subs you have to check their own WeTV/Tencent Video/etc. website.\n\nViki has the 1st, 2nd, and 5th seasons of the Chinese version of Heart Signal, so you'll have to look for the 3rd (\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7S3) and 4th season (\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7S4) elsewhere. Like use auto-translate/etc. with the Youtube episodes, or check their actual WeTV/Tencent Video website.\n\nHeart Signal 3 (Chinese Version), Episode 1 and playlist (has Thai and Vietnamese subtitles, use auto-translate to English/any desired language): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywBixGNlkYs&amp;list=PLMX26aiIvX5reBhNMq0rNZHoDa_aGblAs\n\nHeart Signal 4 (Chinese Version), Episode 1 and playlist (these episodes on Youtube for the 4th season don't even have automatic captions/subtitles (no Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese/etc. subs either), so go on WeTV/Tencent Video's website or some places (like Bilibili, etc.) for other subtitles): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWNF5cxAap0&amp;list=PLb8w8KsDSK1wtxaCeyEAMXCHxsCYJLK4A\n\n---\n\nIf you don't want to wait for Viki/VIU/KOCOWA/etc. subtitles (and to get ahead of spoilers), you guys can watch the raw Episode 4 on this Channel A (\ucc44\ub110\uc5d0\uc774\ubc29\uc1a1\uc601\uc0c1) channel (appears like an hour or so later): https://www.youtube.com/@user-sh4gc2fu9i/videos\n\nThey regionally restricted it right after Episode 2, lol, so a VPN set to Korea will probably unlock it. This was the link to Episode 2 of Heart Signal 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0IHJ44sQdg\n\nThat video for Episode 2 (from the Channel A (\ucc44\ub110\uc5d0\uc774\ubc29\uc1a1\uc601\uc0c1) channel) has no English/etc. subtitles, but with auto-generated Korean, you can use auto-translate to English/any desired language (it worked two weeks ago): https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/13q991t/heart_signal_4_episode_2_230524/jlgihm0/\n\nThis is the link to Episode 3 of Heart Signal 4 from the Channel A (\ucc44\ub110\uc5d0\uc774\ubc29\uc1a1\uc601\uc0c1) channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSS5o-ExEA8\n\nOh and if you want to watch it live (there's advertisements and other shows around the Heart Signal 4 episode stream), then you can also visit the Channel A website: https://www.ichannela.com/com/cmm/onair.do\n\n**Note the release schedule in Korea: like UTC+9, Korean Standard Time, 10:50PM every Friday. That just translates to around 9:50AM New York Time/Eastern Daylight Time**. So make sure to tune in around that specific time as otherwise you'll miss the episode release and get like a different thing, lol.\n\n---\n\nNew Japanese dating show called \"**Is She the Wolf**\" on Netflix later this September 2023, it's kinda like Love Catcher: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc8Q4T0HFkQ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/13y0vbp/new_netflix_series_is_she_the_wolf_looks_like_it/jmkhyea/\n\nFor fans of **EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560)**, there's now **Love Transit, the Japanese version of EXchange/Transit Love, it should be available on Amazon Prime Video Japan this June 15, so like 1 more week**. And it'll have fewer episodes, so wonder how the runtime or episode length will be as that's key for the emotional investment with the show.\n\nTrailer for EXchange/Transit Love (Japanese/\uc77c\ubcf8 Version), called **Love Transit (\u30e9\u30d6 \u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8), from the Prime Video JP - \u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa channel**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGyWTew58-U and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrL5Mc3CuxQ",

But disappointed it was very short... Like 10 minutes or less while Jiyoung's and Mingyu's was 25 minutes. Started 39' and ended at 1:05' plus panel commentary. \n\nI skipped the other dates for the most part and will just rewatch them later. \n\nA little bit disappointed that Jumi is really happy too with Gyeore and at the end of the day, he got her text. It was a really great date and I really liked it and didnt like it at the same time (hahaha). Like I wanted Jumi to get bored with Gyeore and argh! nooo! he turned out to be a great guy. \n\nI'm a little bit heartbroken for Jiwon but I am a sucker for unwavering love. Let's move forward sunbae. \n\nI will still be a Jumi-Jiwon shipper even if it looks like a long shot for them. Will be happy to watch even just the glances Jiwon shoots to Jumi across the table. \nDo not waver.",

I felt good for Gyeore and I feel like I know why he was overwhelmed and cried.   \nAlso, I agree that he is a great guy too, I would have felt bad if he was nonchalant with the gift he received.   \n\n\nI am really grateful for his reaction to Jumi's effort too. Started with his reaction to when Jumi complimented the coffee shop owner and told him his coffee tasted great. I can't explain it but he probably is close with the coffee shop owner and that moment when Jumi complimented the owner was like a happy moment for him.",

He's a lot sweeter than he looks.\n\nOmg does anyone know what the resto MK/JY went to in itaewon with the dogs was \ud83d\ude0d\n\nEw the overlapping music from the music bar and the intentionally looooouuuddd bg music editors added during JY and MK's date was sooooooo bad. Could PDs not just have paid for the music rights of the songs they chose? That was so unpleasant. And low budget. They didnt even choose songs that had the same vibe. They just chose loud songs with loud beats to try to cover up the bg music! I'm so disappointed. Or maybe it's a streaming issue? Did the original korean broadcast play the actual songs? And it's just viki/kocowa that changed the music?\n\nOmg was GR abt to say to Jumi that he chose financiers bc JY said she liked them???? I almost died. Then he said something totally random which makes me think he thought abt it and changed his mind.\n\nJumi def acted a lot more aegyo w GR compared to Jiwon. Awww i like that she gave him something in exchange for his present. Poor jiwon did not get this lvl of effort \ud83e\udd72. Awwwww and GR was so moved! Maybe bc JY didnt really acknowledge/appreciate his efforts and Jumi did?\n\nLovelines were obvious this week. Everyone was just polite to the ones they dated.\n\nOoooooooh jumi goes for it w MK next week! Exciting!",

Jumi's demeanor during her date with Jiwon and Gyeore were so different. Jumi looked incredibly laid back and comfortable during her date with Jiwon. She was considerate, fun, &amp; warm as always, but that's just who she is as a person. I think that's how she treats everyone. But with Gyeore - she was so different. Although still confident, she had her moments of shyness. Her present to Gyeore was so thoughtful and you can see how she really wanted to relay her appreciation towards the gift that Gyeore prepared for the girls.  Gyeore seemed genuinely touched and moved by her gift and I hope this is the starting point of him opening more of his feelings to Jumi. I like how Jumi didn't want to make it awkward for Gyeore when he teared up, but also didn't dismiss his feelings and responsed in such a respectful way.  Jumi is just so great \ud83d\ude2d To be honest, I think Gyeore wanted to say that he picked out that gift while thinking about Jiyoung, but stopped himself. \n\nI love how Jimin and Hushin came back from their date SO sure that they came home the latest (as if it was some competition). I think Jimin just wanted to show off that she's a fun date and that the other boys were \"missing out\" on her. But she was faced with harsh cold reality when she found out their date actually ended the earliest amongst all of them \ud83e\udd23",

They change out members of the commentary almost every season. Members that have different views and are a compliment to eachother are more likely to be recast for the next season. \n\nIts funny how you don\u2019t mention the idols who are basically useless. If it was so scripted the idols would say more.\n\nAlso, its just so much healthier for a commentary panel to have alternate views. Terrace House was infamous for how they would dogpile on some of the housemates and while they were just having some fun, the audience would harass the housemates for it because Terrace House didn\u2019t have alternate views willing to play devil\u2019s advocate, and for the most part Terrace House was run by the two main comedians and everyone else on the panel were yes-men.",

            "comment": "I want to like Jumi and Jiwon but there's still something there that's missing. They are both kind and considerate people but the age and the hectic intern schedule seems to be playing a much bigger role than expected. Maybe it's because Jumi knows just how hectic and busy that kind of period in one's life is so she's worried for him but not really feeling him as a potential love interest. He also seems to be picking up on that, hence the comments on him not being that young and him also having experience. Jumi at the very least also seems willing to give it a try so those shooting for JiwonxJumi, there's still hope yet!\n\nThough at this point, I personally want see her on a date with Hushin to see a more proactive guy's approach and maybe even one more with Gyeore though I don't personally think that's going to go anywhere. He's definitely very sentimental and introspective which Jumi likes and it's obvious she treated her date with him like an actual date but I just don't see him choosing her in the end. At the very least, I'm glad his date with Jumi showed him how bright she can be and how she's been paying so much attention to him. Maybe once the female catfish is introduced (they need to do it soon or the female catfish will have zero presence) and all the pieces are on the board would there be reason for big changes but for now, Jumi has two maybe three tenuous love lines. And maybe it's me wanting good things for her, but I hope Hushin gives her something Gyeore and Jiwon can't and letting her know just how awesome she is. I know she is still curious about Mingyu and they have had zero chances together but going by the type of girl he likes, it's ultimately a showdown b/w Jimin and Jiyoung for him and I reckon Jumi would make it known she's interested but not end up battling it out for him.\n\nMy fav part of the ep is the JiyoungxMingyu date. Mingyu is kinder and more charming here to Jiyoung but the way Jiyoung was eyeing him the entire date, phew boy it really felt like she was asking herself whether it was fine to be this into a guy. The vibes were just chef's kiss. Especially around the 53 min mark when the acoustic music was playing and there was silence and smiles from the two, the way Jiyoung stared down contemplating forever, then glanced up at him and smiled shyly then KEPT glancing at him. That stuff is what dramas dream of replicating. Also Mingyu asking Jiyoung for answers about Gyeore felt weird at first but as it went on, I liked how he's willing to ask about others cuz this season has been VERY passive from the guys and if I understand correctly, he doesn't want there to be a misunderstanding about the eye contact earlier too. Shame he had to then mention Jimin and show that he's obviously interested in her during THEIR date. His compliments thereafter kinda quelled the disappointment from her but it would've been a near perfect date otherwise.\n\nNothing much to say about JiminxHushin's date as it was like a typical blind date, inoffensive, kinda cute, but ultimately nothing. Jiwon is just too busy and Jimin is still mostly interested in him so I don't know where Jimin can go from here except maybe Mingyu even though she doesn't feel the same way he does.\n\nEdit: As a whole, this season is definitely slower and to some, more boring, but I think they had issues with scheduling some of the members and they might just want to tone down for this season after the issues from the previous. I don't mind it since it's still Heart Signal and I like some of the members here and am willing to stay and see where it all leads. Also edited for typos and mistakes cuz I typed this hot off watching the ep and the preview had me distracted and giggling at how obvious Jimin and Jiyoung were at flirting.",

Ofc, it wouldn't be good to hear that as Jiyoung no matter what, but I think that was his intention (...I hope so lol)\n\nI too found myself wishfully hoping the female catfish would turn up next episode",

Wasn\u2019t Mingyu the guy that Jiyoung purposely kept some distance between because she could tell that he liked her from first impressions/first couple days?\n\nMentioning other girls is smart because it gets Jiyoung thinking about whether Mingyu likes her more than Jimin, and it encourages Jiyoung to be more proactive and to chase after Mingyu. \n\nWhen dates are too perfect, people tend to take that other person for granted. They are more willing to look at their options for something better because they\u2019ve already got a sure thing. This is why its so important to get the other person thinking about you and to encourage them to chase after you, due to the fear of missing out. \n\nAlso one of the main ways people convince theirself that they are in love is if they can\u2019t stop theirself from thinking about the person. Since he mentioned Jimin, Jiyoung will be constantly thinking about MinGyu and paying more attention to him because she doesn\u2019t know who MinGyu likes more. \n\nSo I bet that after their date Jiyoung\u2019s loveline will go towards MinGyu for the rest of the show. She won\u2019t pick him every time because its common courtesy for people to send a text to the people they go on a date with, but all of the rest will go to MinGyu.",

I know people here don't seem to think they fit and are a bit turned off by Jimin's actions from the previous episodes but to me their chemistry just works. It's kind of funny how transparent both of them are (about JM liking JW and MG liking JM). Lmaooo\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was rooting for Jumi and Jiwon too but damn... the difference in how she reacted to her dates with the two guys was just so obvious. Hmmm anyone else here thinks that Jumi's politeness that's evident in her conversations with the guys is backfiring? T\\_T It's giving noona-dongsaeng vibes even with Gyeore. Lol. And idk but a part of me kept thinking that Jumi seemed is a little too guarded? I just hoped she let loose a little bit and went beyond just being polite. I honestly can't wait to see her start flirting and show off her charms hahaha",

Honestly, I think that's just her personality since she's a confident and mature woman.\n\nI could see that she was trying to be more cute and girly but it didn't look natural. It's probably because it's a cultural thing and she's trying to fit in this ideal for women.\n\nI really like her personality so I hope she doesn't try to act in a different way to appeal more to the men.",

The way he still seems so full of life and energetic after his long workday and still finds time to run marathons and go on this dating show, really does he ever sleep??? \n\nAlso, don\u2019t know why Kim Eana keeps on insisting that Jiwon will pick Jiyoung?

Hard to tell since it could also be they had this nervous energy since they liked each other? I secretly hope no, since I ship Hoo Shin and Yumi, I want to see if something is there\n2. Jumi and Jiwon - they are both my favs, but I don't think Yumi will be able to look pass the age gap + Jiwon seems in a different place in life than she is\n3. Jiyoung and Mingyu - Jiyoung is so smitten by Mingyu! I think she is the one who is used to guys falling over her (like Geyo Ro did) and she is more interested in the quite mysterious types who are hard to read. The fact that  MG brought up Jimin shows that he might be more interested in her\n4. Jumi and GR - It is hard not to be charmed by Jumi, so i get why Gyeo Ro felt the way he did. But I still find him a bit blant and I want someone else for Jumi (that someone else being hoo Shin maybe?)\n\nWhat does everyone think about preview for the next episode? Will there be drama?",

SO. CUTE. first of all they both are so pretty that i cant help but smile, they were really cute and awkward it really feels like a first date and omg jiyoung literally fell in love thoooo so cute.. but seriously i think jiyoung came preparing to charm her date but she got charmed instead and hard at it lolol and not mingyu almost ruin the date when he mention jimin :\u2019) (but just like what the panel said on the prev season, you kept talking about the one you like without you knowing when that person\u2019s not there) but glad that he\u2019s quick to notice and turn the tables around again lol.. but this just confirm how much influence jimin actually has on mingyu aww, and with jiwon having zero interest in jimin rn and jimin starting to notice mingyu more i think its hard for jiyoung to change mingyu\u2019s mind but i think it all depends on jimin\u2019s action for now\n\ngyeore-jumi : just like i said earlier i might be blind hahaha for me her date with gyeore felt more comfortable and there\u2019s not enough tension there idk maybe bcs its their first date?, i really really like the date like its really nice and it shows just how thoughtful of a person both jumi and gyeore are.. but here\u2019s the thing, i don\u2019t feel any heart fluttering moments but actually not everyone wants that in a relationship, i think jumi likes this more and she felt should i say familiar(?) with it, imo she either used to having relationship like this or she alr went through a lot that this kind of relationship is more convenient/appealing to her.. with her initial curiosity for gyeore, and never experiencing a relationship with a younger man like jiwon and also with her having no time to actually get to know mingyu (and to get into his mind bcs mingyu\u2019s mind alr complicated as it is) i think she\u2019s going with gyeore but also gyeore\u2026\u2026. sigh\u2026\u2026 he fell head over heels for jiyoung but with the way he really got confused after one date tells me that jumi is just that charming, but we\u2019ll see whether he\u2019s going to be inwoo 2.0 or not\n\nafter thoughts : with mingyu making it obvious to jimin, and jiyoung catching feelings i\u2019m craving the drama between these 3 so bad lololol i wanted to see jiyoung\u2019s attempt to sway mingyu and how jimin\u2019s protective instincts gonna play when whats hers got taken lmao and with that quick sense mingyu in the middle of the chaos \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",

That VOD will have no English subtitles too, though you can use auto-translate from Korean to English/any desired language. It will likely skip some scenes and dialogue or be significantly delayed, but auto-translate these days is really good and so you'll get the gist anyway.\n\nOtherwise wait about 10 hours or so for the episode to release with English subs. After a while you can it right now without subs on Viki/KOCOWA/et cetera, but just wait a some more hours after so that you don't have to rewatch it.\n\nViki: https://www.viki.com/tv/39844c-heart-signal-4\n\nKOCOWA: https://www.kocowa.com/en_us/season/77851672/heart-signal-4\n\nVIU Singapore: https://www.viu.com/ott/sg/en/vod/2162396/Heart-Signal-4\n\nVIU Hong Kong: https://www.viu.com/ott/hk/en/vod/2162554/Heart-Signal-4\n\nViki should have the English subtitles available around say 9PM Eastern Daylight Time/New York Time.\n\nFor VIU and KOCOWA, with Heart Signal 4 it seems they're a bit delayed, several hours later after Viki.\n\nCheck the main post above for more info on how to watch these cohabitation/dating/etc. shows.

Are they trying to 'save' jiyoung image because if they acknowledged jiwon interest towards jumi at the beginning, it will make jiyoung seems like a second choice? The production are painting her as the main character this season. And main character never the second choice. I dont doubt her as the main character of this season. I know she is. Later she might have 3 guys wanting her. Just let the story flow naturally. Why the editing so lazy this time? They were really good during season 2.\n\nAlso have this weird vibe from kim eana where i can tell she dont like jumi. Checked knets comment, well im not alone on this. They are criticising her too now",

He said she's pretty and that they had a really nice time together. I felt that he really enjoyed her company. It wasn't the most romantic date ever but they hardly know each other so this date was a good start.\n\nI share your unpopular opinion about Jumi and Jiwon. The reason why he has sent texts to her before is because he hasn't spend time with the other girls at all, so he sends his texts to Jumi to be polite. I think he likes her as a friend but he's attracted to Jiyoung.\n\nMingyu was really nervous on the date with Jiyoung, just looking at her makes him flustered. It's really cute though and I think Jiyoung could see that too.\n\nI also really like Gyeore for being sensitive. It was clear that he wanted to go on a date with Jiyoung at first but the date with Jumi made him forget about Jiyoung.",

            "comment": "jumi x jiwon: as much as people are rooting for them I just don\u2019t see it happening. Jumi has definitely put Jiwon in little brother category and probably rightfully so. Even though they are only three years apart in age they are at totally different life stages. I thought it was pretty telling when Jiwon said he would need another 10 years to really establish himself. Jiwon is pretty charming though so maybe he\u2019ll be able turn things around. \n\njumi-gyorae: I really enjoyed this date. Gyorae has such a sweet and innocent personality, which unfortunately makes me think he won\u2019t give up on jiyoung easily. Jumi seems entertained by him and definitely more flirty than her date with jiwon but don\u2019t think she\u2019s invested enough yet to try to sway him from jiyoung. \n\njimin-hushin: I basically agree with the panelists hushin makes jimin nervous not because she likes him but because he doesn\u2019t give her the attention she\u2019s used to getting from the opposite sex which makes her want to impress him. I think hushin thinks jimin is too young and sees her more like a little sister.\n\njiyoung-mingyu: other than the music scene where jiyoung literally has hearts coming from her eyes, I found this date somewhat off/awkward, as if the two of them were bringing two different energies to the date. It may have to do with the editing as the conversations mainly showed jiyoung being super excited and mingyu barely responding. He certainly was not being as subtly flirty as he is when alone with jimin. This is giving me flashbacks to hyunwoo-youngjoo-hyunjoo with jimin being hyunjoo in this scenario. \n\nExcited for the next episode girl fight over Mingyu and hopefully we get the female catfish to add even more chaos to the mix.",

They met around 8pm after Jiwon ended his shift, had date until very late at around 4am which I don\u2019t think the filming crew waited until it actually ended since they went back to their own home. !&lt;\n\nThe date took 2 days to film because Jumi\u2019s 2 dates look like it was filmed in 2 different days. After the first date, she went back to her own home, second date and went back to Signal House together. &gt;!Jiwon didn\u2019t know about Hushin until after they all gather back in Signal House on the 2nd day which alluded that them not sleeping there for a night. !&lt;\n\nWhich came the question why PD decided to arrange the date that way. They can just give the first day date to &gt;!Gyeore!&lt; and let &gt;!Jiwon got the 2nd day where he got a day off. Based on the conversation, he got 36 hours off after his night shift, more than enough time for him get a rest and has a full day for a date. He has more than enough time but I feel like the crew purposely plan it that way to emphasise on his hectic schedule. !&lt;",

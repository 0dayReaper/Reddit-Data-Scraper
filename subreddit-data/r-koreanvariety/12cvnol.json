the ball pops back out and **(AC 250-GK)** manages to smother it!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' FM Miss: **(FM 30)** intercepts a cross pass with a nice ball trap, the ball is kicked forward by **(FM 99)** which **(FM 77)** receives but is stopped by **(AC 02)** but **(FM 77)** manages to squeeze a quick pass to the outlet where **(FM 99)** is running down the right wing. **(FM 99)** gathers the ball with her left foot and manages to shoot with her right foot but missing the mark by a few feet!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' FM Miss: **(FM 30)** kicks a quick cross pass to **(FM 99)** who botches the first touch but still has control, she dekes out **(AC 8)** with a turnaround move and takes a shot on net that misses the mark again by a few feet to the right!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' FM Miss: **(FM 30)** takes a sideline kick-in with a pass to a cutting **(FM 88)** who passes it right back to **(FM 30)**, **(FM 30)** then kicks a high lobbing cross that **(FM 77)** gets a great header on, the ball is hit well and is on target but hits the bottom right near side post! the ball then bounces right back to **(FM 77)** who is still alert and gets a one-time volley shot on target AGAIN! but a huge defensive stop by **(AC 02)** re-directs the shot with her body out of bounds for a corner kick, what a flurry of action, great follow-up shot by **(FM 77)** even greater stop by **(AC 02)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' FM Foul: **(FM 30)** tries to kick at a high ball and hits **(AC 1)** no injuries, just a dangerous play, AC get a free kick deep in their zone!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** takes a sideline kick-in with a high ball that **(FM 30)** and **(FM 88)** misplay, **(AC 33)** is there and manages to capitalize on their mistake with a quick outlet pass to the right wing for **(AC 1)** who one-time shoots on net but misses the mark by meters!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' FM Miss: **(FM 10-GK)** throws the ball to **(FM 30)** who traps the bouncing ball and manages a quick tap pass to the left wing to herself!, **(FM 30)** regains control of the ball and now is 1 v 3 as she dribbles down the left wing, **(FM 30)** manages to take a tough angle power shot on target but **(AC 250-GK)** blocks and smothers!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** dribbles the ball up on the left wing from her defensive zone beating **(FM 99)** and then **(FM 30)** now cutting towards the middle she takes a power shot on target that **(FM 10-GK)** blocks a huge rebound is given but **(FM 10-GK)** smothers it up before AC can get a follow up shot!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!18' FM GOAL: **(FM 10-GK)** throws the ball deep but the players miss the chance to trap it and it bounces high, **(AC 8)** tries to box out **(FM 30)** from getting to the ball and is letting it roll towards her net and possibly out for a corner kick, but **(FM 30)** continues to follow the ball and manages to take a SHOT on target that hits the near side bottom right post, the ensuing re-direction off the post goes to the opposite side of the net where **(FM 77)** was positioned and she takes a follow up shot on target and in the net, INSANE, poor decision making by **(AC 8)** for allowing a ball to trickle deep into her own zone, great concentration on following the ball by **(FM 30)** and even crazier finish by **(FM 77)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' AC Sub: **(AC 1)** subs off for **(AC 11)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** takes a quick corner kick with FM defense still getting into position with a short pass to **(AC 1)** who one-time shoots it on target with power, the ball hits the wide side middle left post and deflects into the hands of a turning **(FM 10-GK)** she bobbles the first touch but pounces on the bobbled ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' AC Miss: **(FM 10-GK)** kicks the ball deep into AC territory, **(AC 02)** tracks it down and kicks the bouncing ball forward to **(AC 1)** who powers through a FM defender and gets an outlet pass kicked to **(AC 33)** who one-time shoots a weak bouncy roller that misses the wide right side by a few feet, she had time to trap and then shoot rather than one-time shoot the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' FM Miss: **(FM 30)** crosses a pass to an open **(FM 99)** who one-time shoots on target to the near left side but **(AC 250-GK)** blocks and re-directs into the corner, she smartly doesn't use her hands as it left the 16 yard box!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' FM Foul: **(FM 30)** takes a sideline kick-in that **(FM 88)** gets her feet up high on and with **(AC 33)** using her head, the play is dangerous, no one injured, free kick awarded to AC deep in their own zone!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** takes the direct free kick with a shot on target that **(FM 10-GK)** smothers!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** takes a sideline kick-in from deep in her zone with a shot on target that **(FM 10-GK)** bobbles and a huge rebound is there, both **(AC 33)** and **(AC 11)** close in on the ball but **(AC 33)** manages to touch, the ball HITS THE POST, **(FM 30)** kicks the ball out of bounds to the sidelines, INSANE this ball didn't go in!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' AC GOAL: **(AC 8)** takes a sideline kick-in from deep with a shot on target that hits the back of **(FM 88)** and re-directs squarely into the net, great shot but not lucky for FM!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~20' FM Miss: **(FM 77)** takes the centreline kick with a shot on target that **(AC 250-GK)** catches easily!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~20' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot on target that hits the near side left post and hits **(FM 10-GK)** and the ball dances on the goal line!

            "comment": "Great game that was back and forth. Next week looks like it will be a good game but I fear that controversy may hit the show. For context in 2011 the K league had a huge match fixing scandal, up to 100+ players and coaches were exposed, multiple players committed suicide and about 100 players and coaches were permanently banned from the sport. K league suffered a massive drop in attendance in the years after and are just now getting the attendance back up. During Korea\u2019s recent friendlies last week the KFA decided to without explanation pardon all of the banned players and coaches under the guise of celebrating a successful world cup. Unsurprisingly that did not go well with the public and two days later they reversed the decision and two days after on this Monday the entire KFA vice presidents and board (excluding the head of the KFA) resigned this included Lee Young pyo(Gavangers), Kim Byung ji(Top Girl) and Lee Gong guk(former player with the famous twin daughters). And the comment section on there apology posts on their igs do not look good for them at all. I don\u2019t know if the public will criticize the show for having them in it but it is 100% something to look out for for next week. Shin Young who was formerly with fc anaconda is also on the KFA board and made a apology as well(a lot of sexist comments on her post).",

A bit like Flavio Briatore in F1 or Platini/Blatter, all crooks who in my book should be in jail and not just banned from the sport...",

Hope the almighty netizens don't decide to boycott this show or inadvertently cause loads of damage because as selfish as it is to say this, I don't want Shooting Stars to be mired in anymore controversy and just want it to stay a fun and friendly show.",

The impact on the show is  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (fill in the blank with either they are to be replaced on the show as coaches or the show stands by them as coaches of these teams) and then make clear that this episode and upcoming episodes were shot long before they resigned. \n\nIf they move on from the coaches and make that plan clear along with the episodes being shot before they resigned, there should be no controversy/issue for the show. Now if they said they were sticking with the coaches, that opens up the possibility for controversy. \n\nThe PD will be a moron, IMO, if he/she doesn't confront this head on at the start of the episode. Never leave the narrative up to anyone but you. The PD has the power to control the narrative and also inform every viewer (reminding many and educating some) that the show is shot way in advance and therefore no one should be triggered seeing these coaches coaching their teams.",

            "comment": "Wow! Its the only game so far where I was screaming at least 10 times for both teams through out the game. It was a balance game between two mid-level teams where skill-wise and speed are at a similar level. Both teams came up with a very effective tactics against each other. Exciting game indeed, which I did not expect much from FC Actionista.\n\nActionista: HeIn was great as usual except maybe her hesitant (or may be aggressiveness) to take a shot when she should. I've seen this throughout her games where she could have break out a shot or even an attacking passing play, but she seems to hold it back a bit. YooYoung and StrangeJiIn showed a little growth with their ball control and confidence. It looked like the are a bit more comfortable to take care of the ball and pressed the defense. This really helped Actionista spread out the Bullabang defense, and drained the stamina out of them, while opening up passing lane to attack. Such a great tactic. Actionista might not have the speed but by slowing down and stretching the defensive line, a lot of opportunities opened up for them. \n\nBullabang: This team was built for a defensive-style team and went for counter attack. It worked out well for them again in this game. And with, SongAh and GaRyeong improved confidence and physicality, they managed to put some fear into Actionista. PSY is just PSY. Its too bad that Bullabang are consisted of striker players (in term of mentality and physical capabilities), but unable to fully utilized because they have no stable defensive core, like most teams. SoYeon, SongAh and PSY are pure instinct strikers who knew how to take a shot at goal. We saw it in this game. The change of formation halfway through the game by Bullabang highlighted Coach JJJ abilities to manage any team and make them competitive.\n\nAnd all around good game with so many holy crap moment. Very exciting indeed!\n\nNext week big story: Cho Hae Tae is no longer with Fc Gavengers! What is going on this season? We keep losing good goalkeeper and this will change the dynamic of the team. Have to see how Gavengers will perform without their valuable leader and goalkeeper.",

Cause if you look back, all their offense pressure rooted from a pass or a shot from PSY. It\u2019s a very one way system, get the ball to PSY and get open or get the second ball after she shoots. Any real counter threats were instigated by her too. &gt;!GaRyeong stole the ball a couple of times but her shots were not threatening.!&lt; JJJ should really be wary of that weakness.",

            "comment": "This was an insane game. Barring last match, every single game from the CL to the SL has been way closer than was expected. In fact, since I didn't know who to root for (I like both FM and ACT equally), I was going crazy whenever something was in play, rooting for one team only to cheer for the other when they countered. Before the tourney started properly, I was holding my predictions cuz I wanted to see what Actionista was bringing to the table and this honestly surpassed my expectations. \n\nSpeaking of expectations, I didn't think much of Baek JiHoon as a coach before but he did pretty well this game despite JJJ also analyzing his team well. HeIn would be my pick for this match for MVP but so many players contributed and there were so many close calls that it almost feels a shame to have to choose just one. Also, with how strong Actionista has become (moreso than before) and how FM has already given us the upset with TopGirl, it's VERY likely TG'll have to play their relegation match against Group A's losing team, which despite my bias and fervent prayer otherwise, is likely the Giants. It's actually crazy how before the league started, I saw TG winning 2nd/3rd at the very least and Giants getting a good run but this entire league has been upset one after another that I honestly don't mind if any one team wins anymore because the quality and entertainment has been spot on for me.\n\nNext match for Group B looks skewed though. I saw World Class winning against Gaevengers before they lost Hyeryun and now more so. I wonder what happened there since it seems like they're doing the Giants thing with rotating gks (the mosaic'd player and Minkyung) which means they didn't have a good backup in place. Not saying WC doesn't deserve it because almost all of their players have made considerable progress but they've gotten lucky in this group being paired against two teams that had to scramble for a good solution to their missing star gks. Still, Gaevengers has a stronger mentality than most so I foresee a good fight even if the odds are stacked against them.",

It wasn't the best of the best but it was good the whole way through and became really good in the last few minutes of . \n\nI realize it was scheme/opponent based but I just don't have much confidence in an offense that is essentially just Sun Young. Fire Moth's first goal was an own-goal by Actionista so they effectively had little/no offensive scoring of their own for most of the game. All while they were playing a team with a not outstanding defense and a subpar goalie. Things picked up later in the game and Soo Ah did a nice job on offense so they were able to keep knocking on the door and eventually scored. \n\nI really like that adjustment late in the game by Fire Moth's coach. It really put a hamper on Actionista and provided them many more opportunities, either from stealing the ball or pressing which forced Actionista mistakes, which lead to them scoring. \n\nHe-in is fun to watch play and so easy to root for. I love seeing her develop more and more. I didn't really see anything left-foot specific in this match but that was to be expected. Training it for a month or more isn't enough to change your in-game habits of using your dominant foot. But damn, she's got a CANON for a leg and is really accurate and consistently so. It's so visually pleasing to watch, like a Ken Griffey Junior home run hit. \n\nDang, I feel for Soyeon. Some own goals are just bad luck. I mean, of course technique-wise I'm sure she made a mistake (back to the shooter on a kick-in at a disadvantageous angle) but for an amateur, what she did (or didn't do) is very understandable. Heartbreaking to see her scenes after the game. Not gonna lie, I realize she's new and who knows maybe she isn't too likable but the Fire Moth team could take a page out of their juniors playbooks and be more compassionate and warm. I love watching the other, often younger, teams react to players breaking down like that by going to them, hugging them and drowning them in positivity and love. \n\nInteresting, Choi Yoonyoung is leaving the show. Definitely an interesting development for Actionista. I don't remember her being particularly good in any way so we'll see if the show replaces her with someone who plays better, the same or worse. Also if the show replaces her with someone with a higher ceiling of talent/athleticism. Actionista could be even more dangerous and get a mid-season upgrade if they get a stud player or even a good athlete who is quick to picking up the game (like Dayoung and Kim Min Ji). \n\nChae Young and Ji In, iirc, impressed me in this game.",

Jeong Hye In or long balls for Lee Hye Jeong and players like Choi Yoon Young and Moon Ji In (she might look weird but she can handle the ball) had a better purpose on build up and rebounds at set pieces. I was expecting Jeong Hye In to be the focal point of offense but they come up with greater plan thru Lee Hye Jeong!&lt; ,her physique is perfect for their 1-2-1 formation since she's physically strong - she can post play in front; either creating her shot or attract the defenders and swing the ball for open strikers on either side.",

I'm sure TopGirl will change their style too now, if they want to beat Actionista with more than 2 goals difference. Unless Coach ByungJi f\\*\\*\\*\\*ed that up. TopGirl will be the desperate team now.\n\nAlso Actionista is losing YoonYoung which might affect the next game with TopGirl, unless they can bring back YeJin to the fold. \n\nSuperLeague is not a league where you can even loose one game. TopGirl is in a bind now. I am hoping for their win since its my fav team.",

Match will gone in either way and **if** that match went on shootout, they have advantage since Ayumi is great GK.\n\n\nAnd for Actionista, since they\u2019re in great form this season (healthy and good chemistry) it\u2019s not gonna be surprising that their match against Top Girl will be a stalemate until someone will concede in tiebreak. \n\n\n[I was actually expecting Choi Yoon Young and Lee Chae Young to leave because they\u2019re on KBS Drama right now that has 100 eps on it, it\u2019s whether they\u2019re finished or still filming it. I\u2019m curious who\u2019s gonna fill it up.]\n\n\nThe only way i can see here is how TG will facilitate their midfield links from Chae Rina/Yubin to forwards and **how Dayoung will be show up and Kim Bo Kyung amplify** her game ^(on skills POV, she\u2019s developed already on her striking and dribbling) like Jeong Hye In in this game, she has a lot of options and creates her own chance to strike due to her dribbling and gradually more press resistant because of that, plus the fact they\u2019re (Actionista) tilting the ball so it will not be stalled too much on players and finally capitalized Lee Hye Jeong\u2019s physique in order their formation works. So it made less burden for JHI to overextend that might overlap LHY and defeating the purpose of their formation.\n\n\nTG and AC isn\u2019t really different in terms of passing build up.",

Yubin's goal count keeps going up with own goal which could easily happen again in future games but she is still the best defender who understand the flow of play. Plus all their players are more accustomed and confident in their own playing skills. They are press resistant \nand calmer when playing. Actionista is just starting this buildup style and you can see they were not fully comfortable with it. Losing YoonYoung will not help, and I hope ChaeYoung will keep playing. Both of them were busy promoting their dramas on the social media posts. \nBoKyung is also more aggressive in taking shots and breaking play when compared to HeIn. Of course Ayumi is just Ashin for a reason. With RiNa and DaYoung on the offensive front, things will prove too much for YoungJin to handle. Suprisingly I found her physically weak eventhough she been playing for a while now. You can see it in this game with Bullabang.  Granted that Bullabang are stronger physically, but TopGirl is speedy and aggressive in their play.\nI am still rooting for TopGirl, eventhough this season a lot of unexpected win happened.",

The current in-form teams, WC and WW, have relentless co-ordinated double forward presses which have worked especially well against goalkeepers with questionable throwing distribution.\n\nI was surprised how long the FM coach waited to change the pressing strategy. There was absolutely no point in having one forward, in this case Hong Su Ah, running back and forth by herself as Actionsta passed it around her.\n\nSome of the passing play from Actionsta was absolutely superb; no-look passes, reverse balls, one-touch shifts, clever balls into spaces that anticipated runs from players.

The result was what I thought but not the score, the amount of times the ball hit the posts, I kept punching the air in frustration\ud83d\ude05. Not to be over critical but both teams need to work on their conditioning and He-in\u2019s biggest weakness is her mentality. She is way too nice. The last 2 minutes of the match was super intense but the whole second half besides that both teams played like they were in mud. Also these teams could learn from CL and be more vocal while playing but again that might be because they are too tired. Also I am aware that some of them are playing hurt but taking care of your body is also a skill. \n\nChaeyoung is still inexperienced there are times when she could catch the ball but opts to punch it out instead. But she did have some good saves. Baek Jihoon\u2019s decision to make &gt;! Hyejeong a striker was a great decision. Her goals were well deserved, she prob could have had a hat trick if she wasn\u2019t so gassed by the second half. Definitely needs to practice her own shooting power too.!&lt; Yoonyoung showed great improvement and was able to help with the pass plays effectively. &gt;! Shame she is leaving that will definitely weaken the team, also wished she had scored once!&lt; Ji-in\u2019s random aggressiveness is something this team needs. \n\nI feel bad for Soyeon because she had to play defense the whole time and her &gt;! two biggest chances to shoot were unsuccessful. Plus that own goal was unlucky. She hadn\u2019t had the experience to defend. GaRyeong is funny to watch but she has the passion to improve if Coach would give the chance to her.!&lt; SooAh\u2019s improvement was great.They could switch to a more offensive team in the future if they keep PSY as a def midfield and use SooAh and Soyeon for double forward and GaRyeong as a Sweeper. PSY is PSY but imagine a team uses their own \u201cace\u201d kill tactic on them. They should learn to pass to her too instead of her passing to them. \n\nNext week\u2019s game I am cheering for WC, although the preview made it seem like the new GK for GV would be weak. I think it will still be up-to Naori combo not being too gassed to press the whole game. Ever since Saori found out she was the officially the fastest player in that field day episode she hasn\u2019t looked back and I\u2019m excited to see her play and continue to utilize her speed.",

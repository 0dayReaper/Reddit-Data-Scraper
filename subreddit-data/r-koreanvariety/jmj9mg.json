She was so committed to the challenge. My favorite clips of Jisun were on Heeyeol's Sketchbook cause she was so witty, smart, and funny. Gosh, I loved her for being herself. She had a beautiful nature that made you think this person would be a comfort and joy in anyone's life. May she and her mother rest in peace.",

I hope they're no longer in any pain and that Mr. Park has a strong support system for this horrible tragedy.\n\nPark Jisun was one of the few from Gag Concert I would always watch, she was always great at what she did whether it be gags or other works. This hurts.",

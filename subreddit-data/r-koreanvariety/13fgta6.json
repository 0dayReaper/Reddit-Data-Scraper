In this season, including various survival program winners, the top 1% of Mensa members with an IQ of 156, graduates from prestigious universities, someone who got a perfect score on the college entrance exams, and a legendary basketball player, people who are smart and have good physiques from various fields gather and compete for survival. The tension of survival builds up as the players become more vigorous while they try to figure out what others are thinking and their weaknesses. Who will be the winner of this bloody competition?\n\n# Cast\n\n* Dex (Former UDT, Member of S1)\n* Fujii Mina (Actress)\n* Ha Seungjin (Former Pro Basketballer)\n* Hong Jinho (Former Pro Gamer, Poker Player, Winner of 'The Genius')\n* Hyun Sungjoo (Poker Player)\n* Kerrigan May (Rapper)\n* Knucks (Dancer)\n* Lee Jinhyeong (University Student, Scored 100% In The 2019 College Entrance Exams)\n* Park Jimin (Announcer, Member of S1)\n* Pi (Streamer, Participated in 'Money Game')\n* Shin Hyunji (Model)\n* Xitsuh (aka. Seo Chulgoo, Rapper)\n* YunB (Rapper, Winner of 'Survival Men and Women')\n* Yurisa (Model, 156 IQ, Mensa Member)\n\n# Notes\n\n\rSo it looks like this account got flagged as being a spam account, hence the delay/inconveniences for posting episodes for The Time Hotel. My current leading theory that was suggested to me is that I got reported by Dex fans because I was disagreeing with them in the last post lmao. Cheers for getting my entire post and comment history wiped, really helping out the community and ensuring more people watch this show. \n\nAlso, my associate who makes the torrent files is away this week, so I had to find an independent Korean torrent, hence why E5 and 6 are together this week and there's a recap segment for the previous episodes.",

The way she sat there and took everything that man was saying urgg that could never be me. What baffled me was that not a single person said something to defend her. Like what? To me they seem to have no backbone at all. Even if mina was my enemy i would have spoken up and said something just anything. Pi is my eyes just as worse like how could you say mina is basically dumb and needs to go when she send your ass home \ud83e\udd2dyou wouldn\u2019t even be here if that girl didn\u2019t drop out \ud83d\ude44 the irony!

She played the game better than you. Mina has partially completed the path yet Jinhyeong decides to restart building the path after he comes back from the hunt.!&lt;\n\nAnyone able to share how does the Korean viewers think abt Jinhyeong/outdoor team sending Mina to death match?\n\nPhantom player return of the eliminated players or guest?",

She picked all of the smartest people, and avoided all of the arrogant people who think they are smart. \n\nIts so brainless to pick Mina for the deathmatch. They just announced that the game would be moving towards individual games. Its ridiculous that they pick this guy again for teamwork reasons. You aren\u2019t going to be a team anymore! Also, your team keeps failing at team tasks so even if you could work together in the future tasks, your team sucks at it. This dude actively lost you the round, and you think he\u2019s stronger than Mina, this is the perfect time for you to eliminate a strong player.\n\nAh its so annoying that these players don\u2019t understand the concept of eliminating strong players early on in the game. Your odds of winning these games go down dramatically if you always vote out the weakest player. You need to keep the weak players around because 1) they are easy to manipulate usually in team environments. 2) they are easy to backstab when your group gets too big and 3) they have no shot at winning in the finals.",

He didn't even come up with a decent strategy for defending the mansion.\n\nMainmatch 4, pretty much took control but lost to jinho's strats\n\nMainmatch 5, acted as the leader smugly dismissing Mina's better solution for the game and lost by 1.4m difference\n\nThis guy is a deadweight if we really think about it, ironically his contribution came off his politicking instead of his calculations. If only his teammates would do a double take they'd realize he's a liability cause he made them lose twice already. That's a lot better than the two girls(Yurisa and Mina) whom they voted for not being able to gel with the team. \"No\" impact during team games is better than negative impact.",

They are voting for her because she is a girl and thats the only reason.\n\nThey isolated her from day one when they suggested boys vs girls. Obviously Mina wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable taking control of the team games after they abandoned her so easily for no good reason. Then when Mina rejoined the team and was forced to be on the same team with them Mina did everything they asked her to do, she was a loyal minion for her team. So I think its incredibly fucked for them to say that she had \u201cno impact\u201d. \n\nIf that team was smart they would have recognized that Mina is the perfect person to protect and manipulate. Mina will always follow their plans and when it comes time for them to eliminate someone from their team Mina is an easy choice to backstab when necessary. Constantly trying to vote her away is such a stupid move. Maybe you give JY that first chance when he fucked up the team game, but by the time he fucked up the 2nd team game you need to get rid of him. He\u2019s an obvious candidate for elimination, and especially after seeing him talk that shit directly to Mina\u2019s face I would have had even more reason to vote him out. How could you trust a guy that is so sleazy that he won\u2019t take responsibility for his failure and then rubs it in the other elimination candidate\u2019s face. Mina did nothing to deserve this treatment its so fucked.",

However, he did nothing about it ( at least from was shown/ aired).  He has a conscience but was not brave enough to stand up against his group. Maybe it was the most rational to vote for her, so I won\u2019t knock him too hard for it.\n\nI didn\u2019t think much of Sung joo until he volunteered to go into the Deathmatch instead of Mina. He also did it in such a caring manner. Coming over to her while she was crying to let her know she still had a chance to remain in the game. So sweet.",

I also think it was a really shit thing for him to do with all of the sounds he makes and him intimidating the girls by running behind them like that during the numbermaze game. To some degree I can accept the strategy or following the enemy teams player, but its the way that he did it which was disgusting. \n\nUnlike other people I also don\u2019t respect Knucks never speaking up about who she get eliminated. For someone that likes to intimidated others and be a leader he has no backbone. This vote isn\u2019t the first time that Knucks was planning to work/help someone else but then completely changed his mind as soon as he talked to the basketball player. They go and talk in that same area everytime and like a broken record the basketball player suggest voting a girl immediately and everyone agrees right away. Dude doesn\u2019t even float the idea, he is so spineless. He doesn\u2019t have to say \u201clets keep mina around\u201d, he just has to mention \u201care you sure we shouldn\u2019t vote for the cocky guy that just lost us the game by giving us 1million points?\u201d. Or he could say something like \u201cmina might not contribute to our plans but she does whatever we tell her to do, we can control her, are you sure we should vote mina.\u201d Or say \u201cThis will eventually become an individual game, wouldn\u2019t it make sense to vote off and eliminate players that could be a threat especially when they caused our loss. Mina\u2019s not a threat to win the finals so I don\u2019t see a point in getting rid of her so soon.\u201d\n\nDude also got tricked by one of the flimsiest tricks I\u2019ve ever seen in the Pyramid smashing game.",

Also why was she being so strange to Knucks?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Jinho!&lt; carried the Mansion team in the MM. I found it hilarious that Dex described how &gt;!Jinho transformed from a lethargic old man in the jungle to a genius at the mansion!&lt;.\n\nNot sure why the Jungle team keeps picking on Mina.&gt;! It\u2019s not like she contributed to the team\u2019s loss. Their strategy was formulated by Jinhyeong and Sungjoo. I don\u2019t buy the \u201cMina doesn\u2019t understand Korean well\u201d argument. Also, if I were a contestant, I would leave the weakest players until the end to maximize my chances of winning. I\u2019m surprised Sungjoo volunteered because he had the most money in the game, and win or lose, all his money will go away once he goes to the dungeon. Maybe some clever editing hid his money transfer or he was unaware of this rule.!&lt;\n\nEp6:\n\nIt\u2019s well within the rules to raid whatever you\u2019d like, &gt;!but I thought the Jungle team stealing the kettles was a low blow. The difference from Dex tearing the tents to this is that the Mansion team earned and spent money on those tents, while the kettles were supplied by the show. Yes, Jimin did steal A pot, but she didn\u2019t steal all the cookware making it impossible for the other team to make ramen.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I lol\u2019d when I saw the Mansion team wearing sunglasses to psyche out the other team. The players and/or PD sure is making the Mansion team so darn likable. I thought the MM was edited poorly. They talked about coins in the beginning but never really showed any players spending the coins or the winning team getting money from the coins left over. Also it was weird how they showed the Mansion team freaking out after they said they made a mistake but then when they are back in the Mansion it\u2019s revealed they got 100 at the end. I\u2019m guessing they eventually exchanged their cards for the right ones?!&lt;\n\nJinhyeong is a human being not a professional actor, he was put in a highly stressful environment and had his perfect CSAT reputation on the line. It\u2019s important to be aware of the difference between reality television and reality. &gt;!With all that said, he fucked up. Jinhyeong manages to survive and be even more of a dick than I could have possibly imagined. I cannot fathom why his team continues to trust his intelligence. He displays zero social skills and intentionally or not bullies Mina into crying. Props to Jimin for not kidnapping Jinhyeong and instead chooses the surprisingly talented Xitsuh.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I thought the rule to have the Jungle team back in the mansion is bullshit. The original team spent 3 nights and 4 days without any help and had to stay up late to raid the mansion. The new Jungle Team gets to use the stuff left behind, opportunity to visit the mansion during the daytime and only spends a total of 2 nights and 2 days.!&lt;\n\nLooking forward to the next episodes! I\u2019m guessing the &gt;!power of the mansion rule will allow the winner to exile people to live in the jungle.!&lt;",

Then just to lose the next challenge again all because of Jinhyeong. Yet Mina got all the knives thrown at her by again basically telling her she\u2019s useless and incompetent\u2026?? And the others believed in his ass like he isn\u2019t one of the biggest threats to them in this game. Tbh expected more from Knucks who knew  how much of an asshole Jinhyeong was being but still stood there and watched Mina get demoralised in front of his eyes as he sips his beer (most likely evil editing). Also feel bad for Sung Joo who seemed like the most genuine guy there and actually seemed like he cared for Mina. Bring him back",

Like if i was a player i would rather join the indoor team and live in the jungle then join those assholes and get treated like shit. The indoor team has such a team spirit there literally riding for each other even if the mess up. I love that about them. Especially the 3 originals jhino, dex and the model. The other 2 i am not a 100 percent sure about. I get that this game revolves around betrayal and you can\u2019t trust anyone, but still there are ways to do it then to go to someone and telling them there useless and dumb. It really threw me off when i saw that. Wish sung joo could still be there seemed a top bloke. I liked him definitely more then those assholes.",

Jinho is a very good leader. he did not want to dominate everything,he accept others criticisms and strategy, even if he is not really convince with the others strategy. he is the oldest one, but he is chill/relax with others, he never abuse his seniority (as a viewer, most of the times i forgot jinho is the oldest in the team cause he is too nice,chill and relax with everyone). as the leader he also willing too take heavy burden and taking responsibility in making decision. as example episode 5, making the strategy, playing in the first two round and brave decision in choosing 7,4 block.\n\nwhile Dex helps Jinho by supported Jinho decision and taking care of the harmony of the team. he knows Jinho is better in strategy area, so he did not try to challenge Jinho leadership instead be supportive and manage the harmony in the household.\n\nJinho is the husband, Dex is the wife. \n\nwhile in the original indoor team. everybody wants to be an alpha male, stubborn and lack of back bone. the only one i say that is the better one is the poker guy.",

The former group have a camaraderie formed out of survival and a stronger sense of trust and alliance because they haven't had to fight each other yet. It isn't surprising that it looks like the newer members of that team who started off in the cutthroat mansion environment will be the first ones to break from that dynamic.",

You need to eliminate strong players early on and save the weaker players for the end so you have less competition for winning in the finals. \n\nIt seems like the show is already transitioning away from team games, so its really not that bad that the Jungle team actually had an unfair advantage. Especially since those players had to endure a much longer time in the jungle and they had less to work with in the beginning. They couldn\u2019t even steal supplies on their first day in the jungle because the mansion team didn\u2019t even arrive yet.",

I feel really bad for her. Even Pi, who Mina has already eliminated on Day 1, proving how well she can do in games, is basically saying she's useless. Good for her that she won the deathmatch, but again, I feel sorry that she's in prison.\n\nAnother level of twist with the phantom players?? I really hope Jimin gets to come back.",

Or the one girl-wasabi that she teamed up with in season 1 being braindead and making decisions that make no sense, going against Jimin\u2019s plans in ways that hurt her own survival.\n\nThe more I think about it though, Hyun Ji\u2019s character could be edited to look this way. Like she could have complained but the editing team didn\u2019t show any of it because they didn\u2019t want the production to seem like monsters for trapping a woman into a hard situation. Also, they knew from the first season that the viewers liked the first girl that was trapped in the basement. So maybe they wanted to go with a similar vibe for her character. \n\nWith that being said I want to believe that the editing isn\u2019t manipulated like that just based on how willing she was to share a room with the other guys when they moved into the mansion. It seemed like she really formed a bond with her team mates, and she took pretty active roles in the team. From kidnapping a person to actually being the one to break the pyramid, to climbing over a blockade and fighting with pie.",

He was the 2nd after Yurisa to solve the initial puzzle, but I think his flawed reasoning skills in episode 1 and his profession made it easy to overlook how smart he is. He did well in both episodes, especially episode 6. He's been so much more likeable once he left the clique of toxic masculinity.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Jinho's episode 5 strategy was awesome to see too, it's not nearly identical to poker but his intuition and read on people is so good. It's interesting how both people in the dungeon (correctly) predicted the indoor team winning.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Mina is completely underestimated at this point. She has good composure during death matches. She did well to stay calm and memorise some strategic numbers. On a side note, for the reason that the guys clique only ever vote for women to enter the deathmatch except the time Sungjoo volunteered, Jimin wasn't going to last long amongst them anyway. It's like none of their own people are considered unless they volunteer, no matter how awfully they perform. How tf does Jinhyeong wind up with 1.42m as the answer and survive. Sungjoo was much more likeable. He may be eliminated first but he had more time to shine and give a good impression.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Wonder what the phantom players are all about. A secret group of people still in the game? The already-eliminated people? If they do the second, nobody is ever leaving this show lol.!&lt;",

He mentions in the interview how he knew he messed up badly right after they submitted solution and started crying. Seung Jin and Mina are trying to console him saying that the other team might have messed up too (I.e. they think they are relatively close to getting 100). In the end the 1.42M comes as a genuine surprise to the team.\n\nAnother thing I noticed was that JH restarted the whole calculation when Mina was out collecting cards with Knucks.

Meanwhile, Jinhyeong clearly struggled in considering the opinions of his teammates and \\*royally\\* fucked up the game for his team, yet they were still hellbent on keeping him in the game. I'm literally seeing male contestants exhibit behavior 5x worse than some of the female contestants who have been villainized, yet no one calls out their behavior. I honestly dislike so many of the male contestants especially on the 'Outdoor Team' side which is filled with losers. Knucks has no backbone and is a little corny. Jinhyeong is a dickhead. Xitsuh still hasn't been redeemed in my eyes but I do like his chemistry with the Indoor Team, and I feel like YunB is one slip up away from angering me deeply. \n\nDespite all this, this season is so good and significantly better than the last one in terms of games, drama, and editing. I do miss the camaraderie between genders in the last season though. Season One felt more like a large family that play games while Season Two is genuinely a twisted survival game.",

Hyun Ji having 500k annual income got me a bit surprised, is she really that famous of a model in korea? I would understand if she's a model streamer like Yurisa but I think her profile only says she's a model, anyone have more info about her livelihood? And based on Jinho's earnings I guess he lost in Time Hotel. For the main game, Jinho read his opponents as well as he read the guys in rabbit poker. That was such onpoint prediction and we can all see why he is the best when it comes to reading people. For the last round when indoor team decided to go for 46 I immediately thought 47 was better because it gives them a higher chance of winning and also gives a guarantee of at least a draw, and surprise surprise jinho did call 47 instead proving everyone why they should be afraid of him when it comes to mind games. That small interaction between knucks and Yurisa was so wholesome, I am 100% in agreement with knucks when he said she chose to play this character because it was so crazy it can't be her rl persona right? right? But in the end she was right, she could get out because it's her. literally. cause she's smaller than the gate holes lol. But to escape just because she couldn't brush her teeth was so funny. She's literally crazy, i love it! Bring her to more survival shows pls. Jihyeong cornering Mina like that, saying she was useless when he literally can't even start a fire. It was infuriating and kinda made me hate him a bit. It's also too cruel to pit Mina against Yurisa, she was her only friend and now they are forced to eliminate each other. Good thing Songjoo voluntered, this makes a good match as well because Yurisa had a grudge to settle against him. Unfortunately for our resident psycho this was a bad game for her because it's a psychological game which involves reading people so he definitely had the advantage. The deathmatch was a great game btw, it's the first time I saw this kind of game so I found it very enjoyable. Anyway that game was a massive win by sungjoo, she made Yurisa look like a noob, on one hand it's satisfying to see Yurisa get humbled, on the other I will miss her craziness. I hope I'll see her on another gameshow with a better understanding of team play.\n\nE02\n\nThe main match was a variation of last season's best game where Taekyoon rolled everyone. It's a perfect combination of physical, mental and observation skills so it's still my favorite game so far for the entire show and I hope they have a new variation for S3. Xitsuh with his in the zone moment kind of showed a bit of the same brilliance as Taekyoo did in S1. They were terrible actors though, the moment they all said they messed up the acting was so cringe I know they were just playing a mental game. But to see Jihyeong coming up with 1.42m, wtf did he miss up the order of expression or something? That was such an unexpected result. Should have just listened to Mina and completed the expresion even with only a few cards. At least he could have blamed Mina again if they lost due to having used fewer cards lol. But hey, the idiot tried to blame Mina again haha what a jerk, fucking up big time and still have the audacity to say someone else did worse. The dude also had to say it to her face to face like three times. We get it dude, you hate her, you voted for her, you don't need to rub it in her face multiple times. That's such an asshole move. For the deathmatch I was rooting for Mina but I expected SungJoo to have the advantage cause he's the poker player and being a pro in the card game gives you an edge in card counting, however Mina was surprisingly better at it. Her strategy of adding more blocks was also more efficient since there's a lower chance of guessing all five numers in the first place. This just cements her darkhorse persona for me. I hope she at least survives 2 more episodes. Way to show everyone that she's not to be understimated. It's a bit sad that sungjoo saved Mina last game only to fall to her here but huge props to him for admitting she's better. He was also the only one who congratulated her so he earned my respect and I'm gonna root for him if I ever see him again.",

This is his total income which may include his poker prize and others (maybe the prize of time hotel if he win).\n\nLooking at his leftover time in Time hotel, he was left with around 5H after 2nd round. Considering they will add the same amount of time they spent in each round and he didn't use his time to buy item. Hong Jinho prize from Time hotel would be: 5H x $5,000/H = \u20ac25,000 (only 1/8 of his annual salary in 2022). So, this won't spoil the result of Time Hotel.",

Honestly, i don't think she is evil..and she is not trying to be mean to others or look down upon others on purpose. SHE genuinely thinks she is smarter (and if even a mediocre person speaks to a very stupid person, they will feel the heat of the extra effort of communicating with the stupid person).. that is what is happening with Yurisa. Low EQ\n\n\nJY on the other hand, is book worm but also knows when to go in attack mode, what to do to defend himself. Attack can also be a good defensive strategy. And, this attack is on manipulation of emotions, conditioning people to think a certain way (not like playing a move in the game to attack or defend which is Yurisa's way) So, he is SELFISH .. not low EQ",

The money game was exactly my fav kind of game, psychological warfare. And as expected Hong Jinho delivered. Also can we talk about how Hong Jinho had to appear in Bloody Game Season **2**, have to start in episode **2**, and even in this game he just had to play **2 times** in the first **2 rounds**?! I laughed my ass off when I saw the roll call list listing his name twice. \n\nThe death match was good but I\u2019m honestly kind of bummed, It was Yurisa vs Poker guy, I\u2019d like it more if the brains types are in longer for entertainment\u2019s sake .\n\nEp.6 money game is not really my kind of game, even in a single glance one could tell this is Jang Dongmin\u2019s style. And it seems Xitsuh has a similar arithmetic talent, Kong playing support to Xitsuh\u2019s play is 200% reminiscent of Kong supporting Dongmin in Problematic Man. It was like 6 against the two of them, Dongmin is impressive, although I\u2019m not excited for this kind of talent, still \uc778\uc815! Combined with the \u2018physical\u2019 aspect, this is really more the kinda game I expected from Bloody Game, though not a fan of. \n\nI also notice YunB might be the most balanced player of all the casts, and luckiest too. He basically had a trip to Bali, and even got to glamp for half a day. Only player mildly likable  from the current wild team now is basically Nux\u2026.  The two of them are basically Zoro and Sanji at this point, their unnecessary rivalry and brotherhood is comical as hell. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m bummed to see two brain types against each other again and poker guy really got eliminated. He\u2019s the most logical of them all. I really don\u2019t like that there are more physical players now. Lee Jinhyung (though questionable) and Xitsuh are also definitely more of the arithmetical brain rather than strategy/psychology brain players. I\u2019d really not like it if the mid to last episodes become a physical or the book intelligent type battle. I\u2019d rather watch the The Olympics or Math Olympiad for that.",

Yurisa is so skinny and small. \n\nYurisa also didn\u2019t tell anyone she escaped so they probably won\u2019t even think its possible. Even if Mina is skinny enough to fit through the bars, she probably wouldn\u2019t think about escaping.",

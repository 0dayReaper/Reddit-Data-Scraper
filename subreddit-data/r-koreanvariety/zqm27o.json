They do this scenario with Yoo Jae Suk and Park Myung Soo, and others I think, and do a hidden camera. The planned scenario while they are walking with a lady and car will come driving fast on a narrow road and drive close to them, and they will see what the guy will do. Yoo Jae Suk pull the lady to safety and switched sides with her so he was closer to the road. Park Myung Soo didn't care and didn't do anything. I am 100% sure Yoo Jae Suk was in it, not sure if Park Myung Soo. If you could please help me I would appreciate it.",

Good for them because it's safer, easier to manage, and probably more comfortable than your typical variety show. But it does rob the fans of fun interactions and content that you can't get from being with just your group all the time.",

You're either naive or live in a bubble if you think their company or parents give a crap about these kids. They're just happy using them as cash machines for their own personal gain. I suggest you look into a few sources and educate yourself on the matter of children being abused like this: documentary about child actors/stars named Showbiz kid, Janet McCarthy's book about her story, interviews and stories of other child stars as well. Maybe the issue is exactly that there aren't enough people like me out there who are sick of seeing kids being used this way. Maybe I'm not the issue, YOU are because you see nothing wrong with it and even go out of your way to insult other people's opinions.",

Because I'm a woman and I used to be a 14 year old girl too. I know what I wanted to do at that age and I was dumb. And I sadly know what kind of predators are out there. It wasn't even that bad when I was a child. It is much worse now. \n\nIt is too disgusting to go into detail, but you should know that most concepts on Kpop follow certain fetishes, mostly geared to older men lusting after much younger girls in addition to wanting to grab the attention of children. The cute concept, the innocent act, schoolgirl, dolls, etc. No way normal people don't find this disturbing and creepy. Sure, if a 25 year old is dressing up as a doll and acting cutesy it's fine; she's an adult. A 15 year old kid does it and it's a whole different thing. \n\nMost die-hard Kpop fans you see on Twitter and Instagram are also tweens and teens, but there's an entire world of middle aged men (maybe even women) who are into these artists. There are disturbing TikTok accounts, subreddits, Twitter accounts, and fanfiction websites out there about members of groups, male or female. I'm talking sadistic sexual stuff! I recently had to become a moderator for a Korean actress subreddit because the comments people were leaving on her subreddit were so disturbing and disgusting that normal healthy people were complaining about it on her other shows subreddits. I had to ban about 30 or so users from the sub! And that person is in her 30s. The same is true for most others. FFS there are subreddits dedicated entirely to posting slow motion videos or screenshots of idols at various scenes form their shows and appearances that look suggestive to a sick mind. I wish I was kidding or overreacting about this. I'm not. \n\nSo, if this exists and we have no way to stop it, then we should at least protect children from it. \n\nIt is one thing if an adult chooses to enter this world, knowingly or unknowingly - it's up to them and it is their life and their choice. But a child has no understanding of this and the dangers and shouldn't be allowed in this world. Period.",

No, but not to the extent you're making them out of to be. Girl Groups (at least 99% of them) aren't some helpless little children getting sold off in the sex trafficking market by their companies. Contrary to your belief, most fans of Kpop are solely interested in the music and the performances regardless if there's a small perverted community doesn't matter",

This is why shipping is so prevalent, why the interviews get millions of views, why these idols even have variety shows. That actually supports my point: if Kpop was even remotely about music (at least the recent Kpop, say post 2010) then these things wouldn't be the number 1 drivers of popularity but good music would be. There are barely any Kpop idols now who sing live and sound good live. It doesn't matter if they are talented singers or not, as long as they're not horrible, the producers and companies can work with that. They just need a certain look and personality. \n\nSo don't act like Kpop is anything other than image. \n\nWell, maybe about the parasocial relationship of idols and fans that is even more toxic than it just being about image. The fact that these idols are encouraged to do lives, hold fan meetings, routinely do phone fan meets, open fan cafe, talk to the camera and talk to fans like they are their friends, etc is proof. It's part of the job.\n\nAnd it does matter if a certain small perverted community exists when we're talking about KIDS. underaged kids who are not legally nor biologically adults. Who don't have the same rights and options and understandings as an adult. So yea, it is exactly the point that it does matter. Even if it's just 1 pervert. You won't see me complain about Dreamcatcher showing up on running man or snsd or Blackpink or any other group with grown adults for members. But I can't stay silent when it's 14-15 year old children involved.",

That's why groups like BTS, TWICE, SNSD, BIGBANG and Blackpink are some of the most succesful groups of all time. People love their discography first and foremost. Also just because some are interested in the personalities of the idols themselves doesn't make the music a major part in the process of liking a group. One is not exclusive to the other. Whether an idol is talented or can sing live or not is honestly an irrelevant argument to the quality of the music. \n\nIt's a useless performative activity to complain over perverts when there's literally nothing we can do about them. Unless you purposely search for them, they are in their own bubble minding their own business and have close to no legitimate impact on anyone's life including idols. That's why it doesn't matter",

I can't believe someone is actually saying we should be letting the perverts run free! \ud83d\ude10 That right there is what's wrong with this entire thing: normalizing sht that has no business being Normal. I'm not saying people should be monitored 24/7 or their thoughts checked, you know. I'm saying we need to not give those with sick minds any platform whatsoever especially if it puts children in danger. Maybe out of a 100 perverts only one acts on their perversions...but that is 1 too many! It's baffling to me how you're pretending like this isn't a big deal. It very much is. \n\nAnd if you think twice and Blackpink and BTS produce good music and music has nothing to do with ability to sing... Well then, I know everything I need to know I guess. \ud83d\ude01 Just a friendly reminder: you have no idea what good music is, and you have no idea what a singer does. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

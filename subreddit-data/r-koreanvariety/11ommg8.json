As a fan of Eun-yi and Sook, I'm very grateful to YJS for guesting because there's no way they'd subtitle a full episode of their podcast otherwise lol. \n\n(also i wasn't really sure which flair to use for this, so please let me know if there's a better one)",

I\u2019m a big fan of Sook due to slam dunk, I\u2019ve wandered why isn\u2019t she more featured in some YJS shows but I understand now cause he treats her more like an equal than a subordinate that needs help.",

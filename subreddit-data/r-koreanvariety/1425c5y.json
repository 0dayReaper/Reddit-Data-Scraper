I was just now watching the subbed versions of the new auditions and episode 12 under the 2023 tab is so funny to me especially when he is preparing to kick the sensor thing \ud83d\ude02. When Minho gets a girlfriend or wife imma be sad but happy for him \ud83d\ude2d",

When manager Ahn said that they were training by going up against semi pro teams and U-21 teams plus he was playing as a fullback. Minho rarely ever shows an outstanding play when he plays defense he can but his play is pretty consistent when he\u2019s defense but when he\u2019s a midfielder either in the center or on the side that\u2019s when Minho shines and he makes the most plays and assists. He\u2019s an all round player but we all know you don\u2019t play the best in positions you don\u2019t like.",

I LOVEEEEE the Look, my shoulder\u2019s dislocated YouTube show when singers and actors were all drinking together. \n\nI also loved the game caterers x starship when the actors did the random play dance (even if they failed quickly). \n\nSeeing Park Bogum dance to boy with luv literally makes me so happy. \n\nDoes such a show exist??? Thankyou &lt;3",

Prison Life of Fools as well, but it's got some comedians in the main cast. There are shows with a much smaller cast (4-6) that mixes singers and actors but I don't think that's what you're looking for. If not, I can give some examples.",

They simulate living on Mars at MDRS in Utah.\n\nAll Table Tennis! Kang Ho Dong and Eun Ji Won recruit actors and singers to be part of their table tennis team. They train under Olympic players and attempt to participate in an official amateur tournament.\n\nRacket Boys - Badminton version of All Table Tennis (different cast)\n\nHandsome Tigers: Seo Janghoon coaches a team of actors/singers after a try out. Plays against amateur teams.\n\nBarefooted Friends:  Kang Ho-dong, Yoon Jong-shin, Yoo Se-yoon, Kim Bum-soo, Kim Hyun-joong, Yoon Si-yoon, Eunhyuk, Uee. First 6 episodes is a travel concept. Afterwards, they came up with their own and eventually got cancelled.\n\nMari and Me - Kang Ho Dong, Kim Min Jae, Seo In Guk, Shim Hyung Tak, Lee Jae Hoon, iKON\u2018s B.I and Jinhwan, and Eun Ji Won pet-sit a variety of animals and try to form bonds as they spend a day or two together. They mostly stay separately but meet up all together once a day with the pets.\n\nReal Men/Real Men 300: very old show featuring celebrities in a life in Korean military. Casts change over the episodes. You can check it's wikipedia page to look for episodes you want to watch.\n\nSecretly, Greatly - a mixed cast of singers, actors, and comedians perform hidden camera pranks on various celebrities. \n\nSixth Sense has a mix of singers and actors that definitely develops a unique chemistry.\n\nTalents for Sale - Lee Seo Jin, Kim Jong Kook, and Noh Hong Chul compete in a home shopping channel to find a celebrity friend with the most marketable talent. Kim Sejong hosts with other random celebrities watching backstage as a panel. Only the winning talent is \"sold\" to a random buyer free of charge.",

Either way, it's still really enjoyable.\n\n2N1D is onboarding Yoo SeonHo soon so new episodes with him in the mix should be dropping in the coming weeks.  I haven't watched 2N1D in years (since Cha TaeHyun left) so I can't say how good the current cast chemistry is but it should be OK considering the show is still going on.\n\nAnd if you fudge the definition of \"kpop\" by a lot to include DinDin, I'd check out The Backpacker Chef.  It's mostly centered around cooking but has him interacting with chef Baek JongWon and actors Ahn BoHyun and Oh DaeHwan.  I loved their back and forth and the bickering that the cast went through.",

Here he is with Lee Sang Yeob -  some fans of HCY call the duo \"Dumb and Dumber\" per this clip:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVp-eIHlMc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVp-eIHlMc)\n\nIn 2016 Law of the Jungle East Timor - HCY met actors like Yoo In Young and Oh Chang Seok, and they have become good friends (together with other castmates like singer Kang Nam and SBS announcer Kim Hwan).  Occasionally they still meet up :)\n\nThanks to Yoo In Young for this Eng-subbed video:\n\n[Law of Golf - Yoo In Young, Oh Chang Seok, Hwang Chi Yeul, Kangnam, Kim Hwan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vkQLAfwxrc)",

Cameraman Hyun Jin &gt;! betraying Dindin during the dive, then running away only to be called out by the PD and then trying to drag Dindin to dive again with him !&lt; was hilarious. \n\n\"After working with me for 20 years, he started to stutter too.\" Lmao. Kim Jong Min, you are truly a variety gem! Jong Min teasing Chan Sung and Seon Ho's manager was funny. It's a love triangle because Jung Hoon's manager also checked up on her after the last shoot. lol\n\nThese cast and crew interactions are one of the things I so love in this show! I can't wait for the next episode!",

I wished they returned that octopus back to the sea though, poor fella. I like tako as much as the next guy, but I mean, that octopus can't be tasty if it's that big. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!That foggy sun-less sunset just took the cake.!&lt; Perfect ending for an episode themed 'A Lucky Day'.",

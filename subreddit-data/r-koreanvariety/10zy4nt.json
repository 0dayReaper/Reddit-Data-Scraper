Started following her after i saw her video of chippy trying to steal kimchi from the dinner table.\n\nShe's also the best source of her brother's most embarrassing childhood photos",

Like what is with them going to couples dorm thing  with the girl they clearly like the most and then saying well let\u2019s still see other people .,BOOO!! \ud83e\udd2c\nAnd from the moment wook said \u201cu want to get to know me for free\u201d when the girls asked for his mbti I wanted him in the BIN!!!\ud83d\ude2d like lool I understood what he was saying but I hate the way he talks and then OF COURSE he can\u2019t take a joke..what an annoying guy. i almost felt this way about junghoon not being able to take sojis jokes but she was also kinda scary like idk her facial expressions \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 when he first said it felt like he was at the edge of a cliff I didn\u2019t get it till they went on their first date like yikes\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \u201cdo you like Bruno Mars? No. Harry styles? No..why didn\u2019t you message me back\u201d I JUMPEDDD \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nbut anyways if I had to pick a boy it would be junghoon bc he was the least annoying,  and tbh I guess hyung seok was okay too he was super cute\n\nAnd like you I\u2019m super super happy with all the final couples I had to hold my breath for abit tho, that final coupling was crazy !!I gasped a lot for the conclusion of that love square \u2014that was a super fun binge thank u so much !!!",

They are given the stairwell for secret meetings, cafe for deliberate flirting, a funroom, and even an overnight private suite avail with a reservation.  Your pay for the day is then transferred into your love pick\u2019s account by who you pick which brings in an element of maybe secretly going for the money instead of love. Was fun but some seemed to be promoting their model careers more than looking for love.  One guy in particular, was playing one girl off another with no regard to feelings and it did get messy with it becoming super cringy in the ending.  Thank goodness some cute matches too.",

It's got a really different concept, which is nice to see.\n\nBtw, other shows that have sorta new concepts are **Sleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774)** and **Love Alarm: Clap! Clap! Clap! (\uc88b\uc544\ud558\uba74 \uc6b8\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9dd!\uc9dd!\uc9dd!)**.\n\nSleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774) for ridiculous and hilarious situations, more info here: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10k1l3f/physical_100_ep_12_netflix_out_now/j5p6ees/\n\nLove Alarm: Clap! Clap! Clap! (\uc88b\uc544\ud558\uba74 \uc6b8\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9dd!\uc9dd!\uc9dd!) needs to get picked up by Viki/VIU/et cetera, it'll definitely surprise you.\n\nLike today Trudeau/etc. confirmed taking down UFOs/UAPs/etc. again and it's gonna be a changed world, maybe. These dating shows or variety shows are likely gonna be so different.\n\n---\n\nBelow is basically what I said to tie it to Single's Inferno 2, lol.\n\n&gt; Some people from Netflix or other streaming services dating shows these days were actually from ZAMSTER/LookGating/etc. channels on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtDcEbupijR_gufF7PIEDGQ/videos and https://www.youtube.com/@lookgating/videos\n&gt; \n&gt; Like Single's Inferno Season 2's Hanbin is really funny sometimes on the ZAMSTER/LookGating videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPhBXNyXtCg&amp;t=42s.\n&gt; \n&gt; The girl in that LookGating video with Hanbin is ChuJeong/\uce04\uc815, she's in a new Korean dating show right now called **Love Alarm: Clap! Clap! Clap! (\uc88b\uc544\ud558\uba74 \uc6b8\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9dd!\uc9dd!\uc9dd!)**. It's based off a Korean webtoon, there's actually a Kdrama (from 3 or so years ago) of the webtoon on Netflix.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another guy from LookGating, Jeonghoon, is also in a different and new dating show called **Company/Office Romance (\uc0ac\ub0b4\uc5f0\uc560)**.\n\n---\n\nAnyway, thankfully Viki is picking up new dating shows again these days.\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and Kdramas, East Asian films, et cetera, and more info on where to watch them**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10yej01/singles_inferno_confirmed_to_return_for_season_3/j7zqw31/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/10vdoyn/love_is_blind_korea/j7gz987/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10rr1t6/uma_game_episode_4_230202/j77hfij/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10r0dje/kpop_house/j6sw6un/",

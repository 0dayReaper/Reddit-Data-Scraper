Probably not Oz as Australia have had a couple of k variety shows since reopening. Most of South America looks too risky at the moment.  Africa could be a left field choice, somewhere like Angola or Morocco.\n\nThey love food so it's got to be somewhere with a decent food culture, good weather to showcase the country(rules out Northern Europe at this time of year). So if Europe, it's anyone of Portugal, Spain(Na PD favourite), Southern France, Italy, Croatia, Cyprus, Malta, Turkey or Greece. My pick would be Southern Italy.",

    "postText": "Sharing since many people like me were awaiting news on new season of NJTTW. I guess we will have to wait long for a new season or we will never get one if the rumors about TVN not allowing more than 3 seasons per show are true. \n\nAnyway, I will miss Mino's antics in varieties, especially in Chanel Shiboya shows. Hopefully we will see reunion with other NJTTW members in 2 years. \n\nSource: [Soompi article](https://www.soompi.com/article/1574915wpp/winners-song-mino-enlists-in-the-military-shares-heartfelt-letter-to-fans):",

Really going to miss the cast and their chemistry together if this is truly the end. \ud83d\ude22",

If not then I strongly recommend to watch all shows with members, starting with Sugeun and Jiwon's travel to Iceland for which that channel was created in the first place. \nAlso if you want to see more of their chemistry check out Kang's kitchen and 2D1N season 1.",

Going through season 2 of Kang's Kitchen right now so I've definitely scoured through as much of their content as possible as this point. There's just something about Na PD's shows that bring out the best of the cast haha",

I hope it happens when he gets out.\n\nNa pd still owes some of the njttw cast a kenya trip (based on that live, the hotel with giraffes had a two year waitlist for bookings if the translations are accurate) so i hope it pushes through.",

It helped us during the grieving season. It made us smile and laugh a bit. For now that we're still waiting,  we'll just have to watch NA PD's YT Channel. We'll patiently wait",

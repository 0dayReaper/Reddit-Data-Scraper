One guest, known only to himself, is designated the \"X-Man\", and does his best to cause his team to lose the contests. At the end, all guests try to determine the X-Man's identity\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cast**\n\nMain MC: Kim Jedong\n\n|Yoo Jaesuk|Kang Hodong|\n|:-|:-|\n|Kim Jongmin|Eun Jiwon|\n|An Tony|Kim Kyungho|\n|Kim C|Annie|\n|Park Yejin|Yoon Hyunjin|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Subbed**\n\n|Episode|Stream|Download|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|003|[Dailymotion](https://dai.ly/k7hBNZRWnQhRSOyMYnP)|[Mega](https://mega.nz/file/kbhmyLJC#kSqDJ8ZXJ4dSwPc8a02DVrl4utFoA2FyD26HRnTU9fs)|\n|004|[Dailymotion](https://dai.ly/kN3GcCQN4mfo9kyMYpT)|[Mega](https://mega.nz/file/JKZCUZBI#KTHIQ6-Z_Y1PCtNKuUk891UDSIKII-ksdDBWF9bCUTg)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Message**\n\nAll right, welcome back everybody and apologies for the long wait. Part 2 of X-Man 1 is complete!  If you missed it, the first part can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yymsll/xman_episodes_1_2_2003110815/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). \n\nLet me know if there are any questions, comments, or suggestions, thank you!\n\n**Please note that Orisubs is a team of only two people. We appreciate your patience as these are made in our own free time; we will not have a set release schedule. Feel free to share, though we do ask that you do not upload these videos to Youtube. SBS is super strict about their copyrights.**\n\nSpecial shoutout to our raw video provider!\n\nWe are always recruiting translators! If anyone is interested, don't hesitate to reach out to me or u/randomfankv\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Creating both hard and soft subs without a full team would be too time-consuming and tedious. With just one person doing all the timing and typesetting, we've elected for hardsubs. Sorry, but currently we do not plan to create softsubs.",

In XMan 2, YJS and KJD swap, and it gets reduced to two chances, four episodes. Then starting with XMan 4, it's one chance, two episodes per XMan.",

Nice having JH guest again especially since he's into the theme, the part with DY felt so rushed but cool he played a physical game, the 2nd part intro talk was hilarious, the cast's chemistry &amp; banter is great, enjoyed their market trip/ food.!&lt;\n\nChoi Hyungin PD recent interview:\n\nPD Choi is a 9th-year producer who joined SBS in 2015 &amp; is also the 1st female main producer to direct \"Running Man\", became the main producer after about 2 years as supporting director since 2020. \"(When I was an assistant director) I only saw it in fragments, but now I have to look at it microscopically. When I was a supporting director, I was busy editing &amp; finishing the broadcast for a week, but when I became the main PD, I felt that it was a continuous shooting every week. I don't think I've even slept in five months (laughs). Since the members are broadcast veterans, it depends on how well they communicate whether the filming comes out or not. I communicate in advance &amp; contact them a lot about what direction is good. I didn't know I had to do this when I was a supporting director.\"\n\nThe weekly schedule of \"Running Man,\" which is filmed every Monday &amp; broadcast on Sunday, is very busy. After Monday's shooting, we will start Sunday's broadcast &amp; next Monday's shooting meeting on Tuesday. I &amp; the writers have meetings on Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays, &amp; the PDs are continuing to edit. Starting Friday, I will edit the last episode again &amp; write subtitles. A week is a full schedule. I can relax a little only on the day of the broadcast, but I don't feel comfortable. Because it's the day of the show (laugh). Tomorrow is the day we're shooting again. A week is too fast.\"\n\nThe staff who share the joys &amp; sorrows every week have now become like family. &lt;Running Man&gt; is produced by 7 PDs, 11 writers, 8 outsourced directing teams, &amp; a large number of staff including camera director, lighting, audio, &amp; costumes.\n\nThe number of people who gather at the shooting site every Monday is about 100 to 150 people. PD Choi said, \"The camera directors, audio team, etc. have been together for a long time, so I am close to all the performers. They have been together for 12 years. They have helped me as a 1st time main PD, so they are always a source of strength.\"\n\nYoon Jong-seo, a supporting producer who recently became famous for the cover dance of New Jeans \"Hype Boy,\" received a hot response with more than 3.7 million views on YouTube. PD Choi said, \"When we had a get-together after &lt;Entertainment Awards&gt;, PD Yoon Jong-seo danced. I heard (Kim) Jong-kook saw it &amp; thought he should make it on the air next time,\" revealing the behind-the-scenes story. PD Yoon Jong-seo is enjoying the sudden public attention by checking all YouTube comments.\n\nWhile \"Running Man\" has been running hard for 12 years, the format of the program has also changed little by little. The trademarks of \"name tag ripping\" &amp; \"running\" have long disappeared due to health reasons of the members, &amp; instead games with various concepts are located. PD Choi said, \"Of course, it is difficult to have a weekly idea meeting, but the members actively help. Yoo Jae-seok &amp; Ji Seok-jin are especially active, &amp; all the members actively give ideas. When I see fun games on the Internet &amp; SNS, I send them. HaHa sends a lot, too. Also, no matter what game or concept you take, there are not many cases in which the members are negative or reject it. Most of the game ideas are prepared by writers &amp; developed during meetings, but it is now difficult for a completely new game to come out. Other variety shows seem to be in a similar process. Still, isn't it important at what point you make it different? We have a meeting together for that point.\"\"Running Man\" has been planning specials in the form of domestic &amp; overseas travel in March. I plan to do a trip the members want. It may be a long-term project starting in March.\n\nCriticism was poured out on some of the members. The reason was that making fun of Ji Seok-jin, the eldest of the members, seemed rude. PD Choi said, \"Ji Seok-jin rather accepted it happily, saying that he did not know that the viewers thought of him this much.\" I think it was the production team's fault unconditionally. I should have adjusted it more through editing, but it seems I was complacent. I apologized to the members &amp; said that I would be more careful in the future. The members also said they would try to match the line well in the future.\"\n\nShe confessed that she has a lot of worries when she usually has idea meetings, edits broadcasts, &amp; corrects subtitles. \u201cI try to pay more attention to every single word. The production team has to be more careful in order for the members to shoot comfortably. Any scene that was laughed at on set as a joke can be taken out if it is viewed as uncomfortable on TV.\n\nRunning Man changed its broadcast time from 4:50 pm to 6:20 pm after moving the broadcasting time in 2017, it returned to 6pm Golden Time in the entertainment world' after 6 years. PD Choi said, \"Because we were firmly maintaining the No. 1 audience rating of 2049 in the previous time slot, I was not sure if we could continue that momentum even when we moved to 6 o'clock time,\" adding, \"Honestly, I was half worried and half excited.\"\" (the members) have become more active &amp; the atmosphere has improved.\" The members think that the 6pm time is the original broadcast time of \"Running Man,\" so they are motivated to work harder to produce results. Yoo Jae-seok always says, \"The chased one is anxious, but the chasing one is not anxious.\"\n\nPD Choi cheered for the producers of variety programs from other broadcasting companies, such as &lt;1 Night 2 Days&gt; and &lt;How Do You Play&gt;, saying that she felt camaraderie.\n\nPD Choi cited natural laughter as the biggest concern for the production team these days. We are finding the right line between the game, which is like the symbol of \"Running Man,\" &amp; the small conversations of the members that fans like recently. I think many people prefer laughter that comes naturally in real life rather than laughter from missions &amp; games. \"Try to play comfortably\" rather than \"make me laugh.\" If you look at the hot contents these days, it's not focused on games. I'm thinking about how to melt this into Running Man. However, if we don't do the mission, it may not be &lt;Running Man&gt;, so closing the gap is our biggest challenge.\"\n\nedits: papago translator errors/format\n\nTL;DR: the staff works hard on RM, lots of BTS stuff, we viewers tend to take for granted.",

I'm sure you know who the guest are. Donni shows up later, I think for about 30 or so minutes and plays one game with the cast. \n\nLaughing so hard at the opening for the MT episode. From &gt;!JaeSuk and cameraman Kang Chan Hee scolding JSM even before shooting to YJS liking Haha's shoes so much he bought himself a pair of similar shoes (and he looks fly \ud83d\ude0e) to JSM going around checking everyone's under-pants (not underwear\ud83d\ude02 \"long johns\") and realizing only the people in their 30s and YJS weren't wearing anything underneath. Then getting cheeky with the rest, only to get in trouble for it in 2.3 seconds. KJK just has such natural chemistry with her, he was so playful.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!This entire openin provided some hilarious visuals : poor YJS's legs, the man is truly mischievous isn't he? He had bruises on his knees. This reminded me of them making fun of him always wearing skinny jeans. I actually think that he looks good in them. No many people can pull skinny jeans off, especially men. On a sidenote, while YJS provided some laughs with his pale legs, which btw makes an appearance on episodes with Jang Hyuk \ud83d\ude02, I gotta say and I hope it doesn't come off as creepy but JSM has the best legs in the business. I'm so jealous. Not just legs; the woman was serving visuals left and right with the matrix look in the earlier part and the wavey hair of the MT part.!&lt; \ud83e\udd0d\n\nI had missed the banter of KJK and JSM and Haha and YJS. A nice welcome appearance of playful Kook. He kept messing with JSM both episodes, and it's so cute and funny. KookMin siblings have amazing chemistry. YJS taking YSC's place to do the silly duo skits of slapping eachother around with Haha was so funny too. His chemistry with Haha is so different from other pairs, and I'd like to see more of this. Also, JSM being cheeky and going for seconds in the market and almost succeeding was peak maknae mode. Love to see it.\n\nWhen they mention \"Kim YooKyeon\" (I thought it was Yoohyeon) \ud83d\ude2d WHEN will I get to see yootoni on RM...\n\nEdit : have to add, the scenary for the MT episode was just gorgeous. It must be so nice to experience this. Shopping at a local market with warm people, cooking delicious hot food and eating in the cold, being with friends, in nature. Added some stuff in the body after the subs. \n\nEdit: why am I getting downvoted? \ud83d\ude02",

I don't think a casual viewer would be putting in this effort. Why else would an episode discussion even exist, if not to discuss the episode? \n\nI'm not disagreeing with you. That is a fact and I acknowledge it. I'm just saying, I don't think that is the reason for downvotes. The downvote function on Reddit is pretty useful but most people don't know how to use it. \n\nThe emojis thing is mostly because without them my writing sounds way too harsh. Heck, even with them it does. This is because English is not my first language. So I don't have the best vocabulary and might not know how to phrase things in a way that isn't so harsh. I feel like a \"\ud83d\ude01\" can do a better job of showing that I'm kidding or laughing about what I wrote instead of it sounding like I'm mad or sth. Like, \n\n- X looks horrible in that hat. \n- X looks horrible in that hat. \ud83d\ude01\n\nThe first one kinda looks like I'm saying \"ew! I on't ever wanna see that. It hurt my eyes!\" But the second one is like, \"it's so funny that he looks so bad, I'm laughing about it and not bothered by it\". Does that make sense? \ud83d\ude01 (See? It's not a \"it should make sense\". But a \"I hope it does I'm trying my best here please validate me random strangers online by giving me internet points\" )",

Did you mean to put Chansol with Daon in your last paragraph of did you mean Dahae? \n\nThe 2 sly foxes should end up alone since they are too toxic together... I keep hoping most of their actions were scripted to add drama and love triangles and hope there is no more drama from them",

The only problem was the accident which led to misunderstandings. It's kind of Daon's fault for avoiding him for so long. She should have confronted him or led him confront her but instead she avoided him too long and he moved on from her.\n\nI also completely disagree with the fact that she is into Hanu. She was only interested in him because of the common interests that they shared but as soon as she found out that he's a player she became disinterested in him.\n\nThe sad part is that I don't think Hanuel is into Taeyang she will probably go for Hanu since that's the guy she was always interested in romantically. Yes she is a pushover and yes she enjoys Hanu walking all over her. She will jump on the chance to be with him if he shows enough interest in her, which seems to be the case. And Daon has no romantic interest in a player like that so she won't get together with him.",

I think being \"sly fox\" is neutral, means it can be bad if paired with a person, or it can be a strong point of a relationship. Taeyang is different from Daon and I think a little more understanding for each other (from BOTH) can be a great couple. Also maybe if Taeyang with Haneul or Daon with Hangeyol is not enough fuel. Like previous episode of Hangyeol being water, theres no enough fuel to keep it going",

It would have been a nice transition.\n2. Daon and Taeyang are not really compatible. If they'll be endgame *(which I doubt now, they could be pleasant but Daon has already hurt him)*, it would be just as emotionally draining. I'm not sure if it is just me but in the Jeju restaurant, Daon's words really sounds like, she is grateful to him but you aren't my ideal guy then goes about why is Hanu not actively pursuing her. On the other hand, Taeyang is possessive so he can't accept her being a bit wishywashy about her feelings. Then at the place where they last talk, they just slowly started to hurt each other with words.\n3. I think Hangyeol still has a chance with Seulbi if he play his cards right.\n4. I do not approve of Hanu and Haneul. She deserves better.\n5. Dahae x Chansol best couple!",

Because in the episode she said some people would be ok with her lie, some won't.\n\nChansol - not sure. but given he accepts Dahae despite her using a lot of money makes me think his job actually can handle the \"maintenance\" of Dahae. I don't know what it is though....too much tattoos for a teacher. anyone guess what Chansol's secret is?",

This guys and girls are all extremely attractive, you really think they can't find other options outside the show? (Maybe Hanui is the only one that may actually struggle). He is a fox because he uses a strategy? Probably but whats wrong with that? Dating is a lot about oppurtunities, if tomorrow I meet a girl but she refuses me and then I meet another girl that accepts me, she is indeed my second option but at the end I ended up with her.The only thing Hanu did was being honest with Haneul in making her understand the she was the second option, that was rude, but honest at least.",

He never said things like \"You can't see him anymore\", he just got mad probably because at one point Daon seemed to completely ignore him because she was mad and tought he wasn't interested, but the reason he started dating the other girls was to be sure if Daon was the best; you may not like the method but there's nothing wrong with it.",

However the moment she started talking about Hanu and Hangyeol and essentially beating a dead horse would irritate me. The overnight was to get to know each other. Instead of using the time to actually get to know him and try to connect with him, she wanted to tell him why she picked him and how she felt about the other guys. Not once but twice on two separate occasions. It almost felt like the same conversation she had with Hanu when he talked about Hanuel with her. It didn\u2019t feel good to her so why would she think that would feel good to Taeyang. \n\nThe concept of the show is very unique but I think the lies and not knowing is just throwing too many of them through a loop and not in a good way.",

I see Hanu and Daon getting hate solely for this reason and I think they\u2019re just trying to find the right match for themselves.\n\nI do have a dislike for Hanu purely because how he expects the girls he like to stay interested in him while he\u2019s out playing the field and does nothing to nurture the relationship. The audacity to call Daon a vixen just because she \u201cstrayed\u201d. It shows his entitlement and I\u2019m really not a fan of him. \n\nTo me, my heart breaks for Daon for the way this episode ended. If you put yourself in her shoes, imagine going on a first date with Hanu and really wanting to grow that connection only to learn he\u2019s not interested for another date because he wants to explore every connection in the house (again it\u2019s not wrong on his end, but it\u2019s still hurtful if you\u2019ve come to like him). So what do you do in this position? If you respect yourself well enough, you know you deserve to explore other options too because there\u2019s no guarantee Hanu will come right back to you. Then came a new guy (TY) in the house and the first date was fireworks. You think you can finally settle with this one only to see his volatile emotions and possessive trait. He made things awkward with the outburst but expects you to be the one to make things right. Meanwhile Hanu is still lurking around and making you feel bad for straying (which shows he does have interest in you), but makes no direct effort to pursue you and win you over. Imagine the conflict of feelings she must be having. If only Hanu would just leave you in peace and let you move on completely or just straight up pursue you and give you a reason to choose him right? \n\nStill, with these cards dealt to Daon, she decided to go with TY on the overnight trip. Yes she brought up Hanu\u2019s name several times (obviously she\u2019s still somewhat bothered by Hanu because of his outburst the night before) but overall her point in the conversation always concludes on why she like TY best. However, all he latches on is the fact she brought up other guys in the conversation and fails to listen to her main point - that she likes him a lot. I cant help but empathize the bumpy journey she has had. But then again this is what dating is all about. You cant force compatibility. The show has limited each participant to only a pool of 5 love  candidates and at the end of the day, you don\u2019t expect everyone to find a match.",

She has had the biggest rollercoaster on this show and only a statue would not have very conflicting emotions at the end of it all. It\u2019s these guys treating her wrong but somehow people say she\u2019s the one who likes attention and she\u2019s a fox. It\u2019s very unfair to her tbh. \nThank you also for seeing the point she was trying to make was that she liked him the best. Other people think she\u2019s saying that because she wants them to fight for her, like what good would that be for her.\nThe girl has been nothing but honest about how she feels at certain times.\nShe told Hanu after she heard what he said in the room, that she was coming out to listen to the record he picked for her. She told hangyeol that he was initially her first pick, which he should have taken as a hint that she no longer feels that way about him. She told Taeyang many times on the date how much she fancies him and then after the conversation on the table, they were sure of each other\u2019s feelings. I don\u2019t know what mixed signals people say she\u2019s giving. I honestly don\u2019t see it.",

            "comment": "So my thoughts on Daon and Taeyang: I definitely think they are incompatible. I had thought that since his outburst about the alarm but it\u2019s clearer now. While I do agree that Daon shouldn\u2019t have brought up Hanu on the date, I think the end point she was getting to was actually not bad. At the dinner table, she was trying to say that she had feelings for him even though she might have been confused. Bear in mind, Taeyang has already zeroed his mind on \u201cDaon is not that into me\u201d so he was more annoyed that he should have been. \nI am probably one of the few who thinks Daon is a genuinely sweet person. I don\u2019t see her as an attention-seeker and I don\u2019t think she has played a dirty game on this show. I was especially touched when she said she had given it all on this show, and even gotten hurt in the process. \nI think she deserves someone who understands her and not these ones who draw up scenarios in their heads even like some viewers are doing.\nIf they had had a conversation prior to their date, Hanu would have still come up because he was in the situation. But perhaps, because it\u2019s a date and there\u2019s date etiquette. But the purpose of their date in particular was to resolve their differences, so was she actually being malicious by bringing him up? I still stand behind the fact that there was a preconceived notion about Daon being a pretty girl and later an idol, and I think it causes people to judge her as harshly. There was Seulbi who pretty much confessed to liking Hangyeol a bit more after hearing about his real age, but there\u2019s no outrage. But Daon who brought up Hanu in an attempt to reassure Taeyang that she was no longer confused, was met with so much outrage. One comment even said, this meant Hanu was vindicated. I think it\u2019s unfair. But I guess that\u2019s her fate and that\u2019s what the show planned out for her.\n\n\nThen to Haneul, I really hope she doesn\u2019t fall too hard for Hanu. She has seen his negative sides so publicly displayed and I feel like he will hurt her.\n\n\nI also feel like Bareum will grow on Seulbi, he\u2019s a really nice person and I hope he\u2019s happy.\n\n\nChansol and Dahae\u2019s screentime is actually criminal, maybe the PDs think that the viewers are more interested in drama than an actaul lovey dovey couple",

He knew he was the one who was wrong and who pushed her away with his irrational jealousy but expected her to be the one to reach out to him.

I don't get it.\n\nBased on the previews from the first episode and the other day... something's going to happen where Daon ends up sitting on the stairs outside the house and Hangyeol comforts her, and the other one where she is crying alone inside. I need to check if it was the same day by comparing what she was wearing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's see if that odd sign I got at least two weeks ago actually predicts the ending. Because that was so weird. And there seems to be quite a bit of foreshadowing throughout the series. Oh, these PDs know their thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChansol and Dahae are definitely set already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPoor Bareum again. He is the most pitiful among them.",

I think she should have just spoken to him when he wanted to clear things up - that would have cleared her mind and made her sure of Taeyang. It's too bad.\n\n(But hey! Seems like the girl with Taeyang at the sunset scene was Daon after all! \ud83d\ude05)\n\nHaneul and Hanu looked good together, for some reason I'm rooting for them now. Although Haneul is too good for him haha. He needs to make it up now.",

The four other women got their #1 picks except Hanui. \n\nHaving said that, I'm glad DO and TY got their awk incident out of the way early on. \n\nThe horseback riding looks sooooo pretty \n\nWhy is DO still going on abt Hanu??? There's no need to go into so much detail abt him to TY. Gurl. Stop. He's treated you like absolute garbage, you picked someone else for the overnight trip, and you're still talking abt him??? What for??? She's blowing her chance w TY. If she wanted to make up w TY, she could have just said you made me feel butterflies on our first date, and left it at that! Why go on a whole monologue comparing him to hanu and confusing him even more when he already feels insecure. Sooooo frustrating. I'm glad TY expressed how she made him feel like he was just competing for her, and that she also had to make an effort for him to be able to trust her and warm up to her again.\n\nThat sunset tho \ud83d\ude0d they seem to have fun together but will they be able to work things out?\n\nI was skeptical abt CS/DH given their different relationship goals (having fun dating vs marriage) but they are so cute. That smooching photo!!! CS is a cornball and i love it.\n\nWhy is SB telling BR she's interested in HG? Why wouldn't she just pick HG for the overnight date? These people are whack lol. Lmaaaaoooo SB's phone call outing her secret and her real name. \n\nHaneul is way too good for hanu. He better treat her right if they end up together. Their polaroids did look cute tho.\n\nI hope HG has a comeback after the overnight date... it does seem like more people are interested in him now.\n\nOk there's something wrong w daon... why would she bring up hanu and HG AGAIN at the end of the night and talk abt how thankful she is to all 3 of them to the guy she supposedly likes the best??? What is her deal??? Is she dumb or does she think making an insecure possessive guy even more jealous is a good idea? I'm baffled. I think she's trying to say despite getting attention from other people, i only like you. But she's doing it so badly!!! He basically gets triggered everytime she mentions someone else's name and all the stuff she says after is irrelevant. \n\nTY telling her not to get her hopes up was brutal. Woooooow and then saying im not interested in you was the final nail in the coffin. \n\nTbf DO is trying to reassure him of her feelings but the way she's doing it is terrible and i think she missed the right timing. I guess TY is really decisive abt people and isn't able to forgive them once he feels betrayed. \n\nOk i see why PDs threw HG under the bus lol, they wanted hanu and TY to both be with the other's first picks. \n\nI'm impressed DO held in her tears til after TY left. Must be that idol training. \n\nWhat a great episode!!!!",

We act as though people who show interest in us would not rank higher than people who don\u2019t. \nRegardless of every opinion about her character, no one can deny that she has shown that she likes Taeyang the most and she has shown her interest in him. The alarm incident would have been a non-issue if Taeyang had looked at it as humanly gesture or spoken to her about it at a later time. And it was only until she had doubts about Taeyang that she started to consider Hangyeol. \nAnd even if she liked Hanu before, we could see from the conversation that she had decided to let him go. \nSo what exactly did she do to be called a \u201cpick me\u201d or any of the nasty things she has been called so far? \nThat girl has had a roller coaster on that show, the hate is unnecessary",

I think the attention she still gets, the screen time she has, and the drama she contributes to the show make some people critical of her. Had she been not any of those three things, I don't think she would get as many criticisms her way. But alas, she looks attractive, so she would definitely receive some attention. Much of her screen time is caused by the drama she is involved in. I believe a part of it is producer-driven.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have decided not to judge them by what I watched on the show. Those who know them personally are the best judge of their character, to be honest. I am not saying this only about Daon but of Hanu and Taeyang too, the latter two I was admittedly most critical about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do believe that without the drama though, this would be just another dating show. So, even though I get stressed out by watching it, I appreciate the fact that it is unpredictable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish them all the best post-show. Yup, including Hanu and Taeyang lmao",

It\u2019s nothing personal but just based off of the traits they\u2019ve shown. And even then, we can just call them out on that behavior. But with Daon, it\u2019s almost like subtle slutshaming, very subtle. But the undertone of most comments have very negative connotations. I think we can all agree that Hanu referring to her as a fox and referring to Haneul as pure can already direct you to his mindset when he labeled these ladies with those names. It\u2019s even weirder when I see people say \u201cyes she\u2019s actually a fox\u201d like they\u2019re agreeing to that tag he gave to her. You can say she\u2019s confused herself, but they insinuate things like she\u2019s flirty because she\u2019s an idol, she wants the men to fight over her, one comment even said she\u2019s a pick me. I had to ask if the person knew exactly what that word meant.  If I wasn\u2019t watching the show myself I would think she\u2019s someone who fights the other girls for male attention and that\u2019s not her at all. \nI think I remember people even saying she loves to play damsel in distress and I was so confused because she has been nothing but independent and mature.\n\nI very well understand the stereotypes that come with being a conventionally attractive girl on shows like this. But it\u2019s triggering to watch people draw conclusions about her personality, almost as though they\u2019re waiting for her to mess up.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to say she\u2019s perfect but I think she has handled most situations with poise and maturity, from confronting Hanu when she overheard him the first time, to her last conversation with him, or not responding brashly with his outbursts and even her directness on her first date with Taeyang. \n\nIt\u2019s almost as though she\u2019s an easy target because she\u2019s pretty. And you find that the people who are quickest to crucify want so badly to exonerate Hanu. Even I can\u2019t say Hanu is a flirt or that he\u2019s leading the ladies on, his issue is one of entitlement sprinkled with a bit of low self esteem. And lashing out on someone he likes because the person liked someone else, meanwhile he wasn\u2019t giving said person any attention. But to say Daon gives mixed signals to these men who are responsible for their own feelings is so weird. To everyone else except them, it\u2019s very clear who Daon likes or at least it was until the whole alarm fiasco.\n\nI didn\u2019t want this to be too long, I failed. But I\u2019ve seen quite a number of sideways comments and that was why I came back to include this. \n\nAsides Hanui or maybe even same as Hanui, I think Daon has had the hardest time. and I said this in my previous comment that when she said she had given her all on the show, I felt really bad. To be constantly misunderstood, told that she deeserves what was coming to her, be called a vixen and then be brutally let down by the person you really liked. \nI wish her the best of luck outside of this show",

I think I remember people even saying she loves to play damsel in distress and I was so confused because she has been nothing but independent and mature.\n\nI already said this before, but I think some people who say that about her are definitely projecting their insecurities. They might have encountered girls like Daon in their lives and so, they speak from their experience of said person. This is especially true for those who feel strongly against her. Otherwise, how can you explain such an intense reaction to someone you watch on-screen and have not met personally? \n\nHer background as a former idol is somewhat of a culprit too. She said it herself, the prejudice that came with it while she was dating. Even though it may not have played a role with the guys on the show, it kind of is for the viewers as they learn of her background. The problem with people taking this into consideration is, idols should know how to accommodate their fans. That does not mean she is flirty because she was an idol. When did it become a crime to be flirty? Last time I checked, the only time it is bad to flirt is if you are cheating or having an affair. Neither of the two Daon did.\n\nI think it is unfair to say that she's a \"pick me\". And yes, you are right, she is not fighting against other women on the show. Again, this has something to do with being the \"popular\" girl with guys. People just love to pile on the popular one and cheer for the \"underdog\", which is especially true in some cultures like mine.\n\nAnd the damsel in distress thing is also an odd observation because it contradicts with being the \"fox\" they paint her to be. Pick a side. She can't be both. She could be a \"fox\" but definitely not a damsel in distress. The only time I saw her as the latter was at the end of this episode when she was left there by Taeyang. It was only then that I felt she was helpless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I very well understand the stereotypes that come with being a conventionally attractive girl on shows like this. But it\u2019s triggering to watch people draw conclusions about her personality, almost as though they\u2019re waiting for her to mess up.\n\nFunny thing is, they were on the show to find unconditional love that would not have prejudice but the viewers themselves are the ones having these prejudices. It is as if, the viewers should be the ones on the show and experience it lmao.\n\nThis is why in the end, I realized, you can't really judge someone from being on a show. Like I said before, the best judge of their character are those who know them personally. I think, sometimes, viewers can feel entitled about it.\n\nI wish Daon the best post-show, same for everyone (even Hanu and Taeyang). It is their lives, after all.",

Hanu thinks everything is about him when he's drunk. Daon thinks everything is about her when she's drunk AND sober.\n3. Daon is truly the female version of Hanu, just that she gets by on her looks while he gets by on his game. She spent the whole day talking about other guys, while Hanu spent the whole day talking about Haneul.\n4. I lost respect for Taeyang when he got jealous and couldn't wake up; I gained all the respect back when he refused to give Daon the power to choose, and left her at the alter.\n5. Even before Taeyang rejected her, I felt that Daon and him had no chemistry. Their date was boring.\n6. I wonder what Haneul's secret is, that she would want to leave when it's revealed.\n7. We learnt for the first time that Haneul and Hanu talked a lot in the house.\n8. A bit of humour goes a long way. Hanu has humour. Nobody else, except maybe Chansol, does.\n9. Haneul is truly big-hearted. If that was Daon who came in second-place? She wouldn't stop feeling sorry for herself. You could tell she had never even considered that Taeyang put her second.\n10. Dahae and Chansol are a sweet couple, but they're kinda boring by this point. Zero controversy, zero drama. I'm not watching Pink Lie for them; I'm watching for Daon, Hanu and Haneul. I think the PDs think the same.",

Especially in Japan and Korea - sexy dance on stage are the least of your worries. \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m just saying, no one ever backs off when you grab them for skinship.. As a matter of fact, they encourage it to hype up the crowd and make money flyyy. \ud83d\udcb8 Kissing, making out and grinding is implied for a lot of places like that. Trust me when I say you will rather date an actor. \ud83d\ude09 on the plus side, good money though",

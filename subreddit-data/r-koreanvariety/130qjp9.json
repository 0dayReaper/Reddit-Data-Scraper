Their time together is watched  over by a group of [panelists](https://www.soompi.com/article/1581039wpp/oh-my-girls-mimi-confirmed-to-join-heart-signal-4-as-panelist) with varying experiences in dating and love.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In  the teaser, young men and women move into the Signal House on a spring  day when cherry blossoms are scattered everywhere. The participants are  captured waiting for someone with excitement, laughing and enjoying  their dates. Toward the end, the serious moments of participants who  contemplate deeply before making their decisions contrast with the  heart-fluttering moments of first encounters at the beginning of the  clip.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cHeart Signal 4\u201d will premiere on May 17 at 10:30 p.m. KST.

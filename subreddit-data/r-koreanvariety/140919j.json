Since it's a detox trip, they could have done the hilarious painful body massage or putting on mud mask as punishment. Still on theme but more fun to watch. Even the death note penalty could have been replaced with perhaps a workout penalty for those who insist on staying awake... They have a whole entire backlog of RM episodes for inspiration instead of just cutting from the pool of money. Hopefully they get more creative for future episodes!",

YSC and JSM talking about the rather go with Sechan joke cracked me up. \ud83d\ude02 Also the YSC and SJH interaction when he did the boopboopboop farting motions. \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\ude02\n\nLater with all of YJS's complaining I thought they were doing the nap activity way longer but it was only 30 mins. YJS doing the baby tantrum move cuz he was ansty was cute. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI think a lot of the member complaints are for show/planned out. Like when Haha complained while sitting directly in front of SJH so they could capture a reaction. Complaining and bickering will probably happen during every outing like this especially with the staff adding rules and activities to the trip that purposely make it challenging for them. It's the close team and family dynamic that's fun to watch. \u263a\ufe0f \n\nThe food on this episode looked so good. Especially that bibbimbap and jeon. \ud83e\udd24 I hope my friends and I can take a nature trip sometime this summer too. With ice cold watermelon, please. \ud83c\udf49\n\nLooking forward to the Dex meets Dex episode next week. \ud83d\ude02",

She was great in the first 300+ episodes, but I think since the show has become less physically active it forced the cast to improve in different ways either through funny jokes or improv skits (which is why I think Sechan &amp; Somin were great additions to the show). Jihyo hasn\u2019t improved in any of those and doesn\u2019t offer much of anything else. One of the reasons Gary left was because he felt like he didn\u2019t have much left to offer to the show &amp; felt that his presence would only do more damage.

SJH falls under this category, but in addition to being a mainstay for all the sentimental reasons that everyone else is, she always plays ball. She may not be good at every concept, but she always participates, and to me can be really funny when put in the right situation with one or more of the other members. I would always rather see that than someone like Lee Seojin who all but refused to do the typical variety show activities until they gave him his own specific types of shows (even if it is just his variety character, allegedly). SJH is arguably one of the weaker members in modern RM, but she still has the \u201cyes and\u201d spirit IMO. She just always needs a hand or a prompt from one of the others to be funny. And I can live with that, because that\u2019s just part of modern RM\u2019s dynamic.",

SJH brought her own fans for the show, and she can literally sit and do nothing throughout the show and still bring value. \n\nPersonally, I think she lost her passion. But she is staying because the team probably wants her to, and she, as you said it, a team player. In several episodes she mentioned that RM is her family and there is one episode that she got upset because JSJ was prioritizing other show.\n\nI mean, look at how many views from her episode in gym KJK, and compare the views against other members joining the same show (except YJS ofc).  She brought values to SBS by staying in RM, and as long as she are consistent in that, she cannot be fired unless she willingly leave by herself.",

I don\u2019t think any of the members are leaving the show at this point unless they expressly want to and they would all rather stay and work together as long as possible, but SJH is aware that she\u2019s not as good at creating funny moments directly as the other members, and she feels guilty for delivering less than the others. I think she tends to hesitate and hang back on the show because she is very self-conscious rather than lazy as others have implied. This is a personality trait shared with a lot of Korean actors, which is why they generally don\u2019t do variety shows; filming live variety is a little too \u201creal\u201d for them and they have a hard time improvising unlike a comedian. At least in Jihyo\u2019s favor the RM members are committed to prioritizing the show and their team over individual shine, so someone will always be in her corner to encourage her and try to partner with her for screentime. But audience is gonna audience, and even if SJH was the best entertainer in the cast people still wouldn\u2019t be satisfied.",

Glad because I believe all the other ones will for sure be much more entertaining and not so glad because this really didn't make me excited for what's to come, sadly. I don't understand why it needed to be a member's trip episode, tbh. It was like every other episode of recent. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I don't know what I expected, but I think I originally thought a more hands on approach by the member in charge and a bit more of each individual's flair. Although, SJH going first might not give us the best view of what this could look like. This is why I think it was a mistake to have her go first. It really should have been Sukjin or Haha first. They both have YouTube experience as well, and Sukjin even has RM captain experience. His reign was truly fun when it lasted! \n\nThe good parts: \n- Even though I thought it was unfair that SoMin was picked to go with Sukjin and JaeSuk, I gotta say - I had missed seeing these three on their own. Thinking back to her earlier times on the show, it really feels like watching a kid who doesn't know what she's doing getting scolded left and right by her dads growing up into a capable woman who can hold her own when with two of the biggest variety veterans.\n\n- JaeSuk smacking SoMin on the head. That was legit. \ud83d\ude02 I love that he doesn't hold back. He once said on HDYP that SoMin and MiJoo have flat skulls so it's extra satisfying to hit them! \ud83d\ude02 And Haha's drawing of it had me laughing so loud. \n\n- The old lady and her phone stole the show, tbh. I wanna be that unbothered by life. Please. \n\nAs I had expected, nothing much happened. Like I said, no point in not using phones because they already don't use them and the walkie talkies didn't add anything. SJH literally slept while everyone else played around trying to create content and then she sort of made an odd comment by the end, \"you have to do this with like-minded people\". There's an odd disconnect between her and the rest, especially YJS. I could tell he wanted to say \"we're here to work, I have to make it entertaining!\". He actually did say it, a few times in fact! I still enjoyed the episode mostly because of my favorite trio of Sukjin, JaeSuk and SoMin. \n\nNext week: I have no idea who Dex(Dax?) is, but I don't understand why they said he looks like SeChan. \ud83d\ude01 Also, SoMin's friend from college (who she just shot a film with) JiEun is gonna be on the show. Hopefully we'll get a spoiler about their film and also this time things will go much smoother and they shut the haters up. (They've been following eachother on Instagram for years and both of them like eachother's pictures regularly, so they're definitely not unfriendly)",

Or tempt the team with junk food periodically and punish them for straying from the healthy eating theme when they inevitably fail.\n\nInstead, members are more or less overcompensating for the lack of structure with banter (bickering/complaining included) to make laughter and it gets tiring really quickly.\n\nI've been watching RM since day 1, and it's never been this blah for me before.\n\nRant over!",

What is the point of coming up with rules if nobody will follow them and the person in charge doesn't even bother to do anything about it? \n\nThe basic rules were: \n- no junk food: broken,\n- no leaving the rest area: broken, \n- resting: broken (most didn't rest!) \n\nAnd they didn't even care. And the only person whose name was added to the list was Sukjin and it happened to him so many times he basically gave up giving a crap. \n\nAnd then the random psychologist? That came out of nowhere? And while I appreciate learning more about the members and hearing their thoughts, this just really didn't fit in with anything else in the episode. This isn't even a resort or some place that would offer such a thing. It felt like they were desperate for some material to fill in the run time so they put together something quickly last minute. And SJH herself checked out during the nap time and gave up on all of it. She was doing well at the start... \n\nAnd it really doesn't feel as funny when the person they are messing with and being annoying to is taking things way too personally*; like when she ended the episode by saying this is something you should do with like minded people. Kind of a loaded comment; basically saying she is very different from the rest. Which isn't news - but this is also her job, and as an actress the least she can do is put on an act like Sukjin does. \n\n* and before people come for me with the \"yOuR biAs dOeS thE sAmE\"; yes! SoMin also sometimes seems like she is actually really hurt and annoyed or angry. So does Haha. And whenever that happens, I find it not as enjoyable. Because for a moment it is like I'm laughing at someone's actual discomfort and pain. Which isn't something I want to be doing. But with those these are rare, so you know they're mostly kidding around. But with SJH, she is known as super sensitive and not witty enough for banter. I mean, she has cried after a small banter or comment!",

I am definitely not a fan in that sense.  \n\nAlso, there is no need to rescue SJH. As you mentioned, she will be paid for her work for as long as her bosses want her there.

            "comment": "I was wondering if 49 (I think I remember his number right) could play in like ... at least the second tier professional league. (He may not want to).  But he has great speed, great footwork, great ball control, great field vision and understanding of the game.  If you put a full pro team around him, I have a hard time believing he couldn't be successful at that level. It is possible he makes more money than he would as a low-end pro and that is why he stays amateur.   \n\nAlso, I feel like the goalie play was maybe the make or break factor in the Avengers winning. He made a few bad passes, but his goal keeping robbed the other team of quite a few opportunities that probably would have turned into goals.  I believe the other team even mentioned how him going up and getting g the ball at the highest point was a big problem for them. The whole team is better but I genuinely believe his play compared to the other two was the difference in a win or loss this week.",

As long as they caught it and didn't let him take more hits to the head he should be fine long term, but when you have a legit concussion like that it can take a month or more to truly recover.  I hope he doesn't try to get back on the field too early. (P.s. I can't read Korean so I don't know if the coach echoed these points.) But that whole team was tough. It was a great battle that really showed how much the avengers team has grown.",

    "postText": "According to this exclusive article, only Yoo Jaesuk, Mijoo, and Haha will remain on the show. The other cast members Jung Jun Ha, Shin Bong Sun, Park Jinjoo, and Lee Yi Kyung will be leaving the show. The PD will remain on the show but as a CP for stability. The show will add new younger producers for a new direction &amp; fresh start. The reason for these major changes are due to low ratings. \n\nMore details will be announced soon. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m shocked y\u2019all. \n\nEdit: sorry I misspelled Yoo with you. I was in a shock and didn\u2019t catch the typo. \n\nhttps://n.news.naver.com/entertain/article/468/0000942570",

If you keep 60% of the cast then to the public it doesn't -look- like much has changed, even if behind the camera you replaced everyone. So in order for it to be obvious, replacing 4 out of 7 members does the trick. \n\nWith the PD getting demoted it sounds like his tenure was a failure and with new producers, specifically \"younger\" ones, they are definitely going to try to rebrand and do something fresh.",

Which hindered the potential for the entertainment they individually could have offered. \n\nIdk personally I'm enjoying every week of the show and have few complaints...

Really hope in future we will see them reunite on a different show with Byung Jae as member for it. My favorite episode recently was with him partaking in the snack trip episode. I thought he fit really well and was entertaining.\n\nWas hoping to see a How do you play vs Running man episode in the future, but guess that is a pipe dream now.",

But the moment he wasn't there, they were all unfunny.\n\nJinjoo built chemistry with mijoo too late. Yikyung always felt like he treated yjs like too much of a boss. Junha and bongsun only shined when with yjs too.\n\nI know ppl hate the comparison, but think about early Running Man. You could put any of the members in any configuration and a storyline came out. That's how you knew RM would succeed, the cast just worked. In this show tho, only the team with yjs has any chemistry.",

            "comment": "The problem is, the projects so far have not allowed Bongsun or Junha to really show off their kind of humor. They could be effective but they're not because of this show's staff and while it is disappointing, is understandable since they can't just change the entire staff. Yikyung and Jinjoo was a bit of a surprise since they at least got a few good moments but if they want to revamp, then it is much easier with 3 members; it also doesn't help that Yikyung and Jinjoo have their own acting to deal with so they probably didn't think it worth the risk to include them. Sad that they got casted cuz they did well previously but are now being let go due to what I think is mainly incompetence from the staff. If the only remaining members are Jae Suk, Haha, and Mijoo, then I have a feeling they're going to do more projects that allow guests to make up for the void in the beginning (and likely cuz good guests + projects were peak HYDP). I hope it doesn't become a Yoo Quiz like show with the occasional music projects tho.\n\nAlso, this makes what Jae Suk and Mijoo said on their latest Ddeunddeun episode with Somin and Seho much more relevant. Now I know why he spent such a long time on that topic almost as if to reassure the audience/viewers that sometimes cast members have to change for the good of the show. At the time, it did feel a bit like he was trying to cover for the staff (to the degree that I found it slightly off-putting) but I chalked it up to me being paranoid; I guess it wasn't that far off the mark. News like this are sad, but if this is ultimately what makes HDYP a good show again, then I can only hope the cast members that are let go can make a guest appearance one day for projects that will make them shine and they can all put this behind them.",

But it was also short enough that you didn't get tired of people and no one was forced into a concept that didn't fit them. Same with the mini series he did with Lee Young Ji (I forget who else was in it) where people wrote in letters, and ssak3, and Refund sisters.\n\nI stopped watching not long after Jin Joo and Yi Kyung joined. Nothing to do with them, I just felt like the show had absolutely no direction anymore and I was confused with what I was watching.

A good variety PD is WELL WORTH the money. With the amount of ad revenue Hangout with Yoo used to bring in, what a dumb shortsighted move to let PD Kim Taeho go.\n\nBack to the cast change, yes it is 100% warranted. Not hating on any member here, but the fact remains that the current size of the cast is untenable. The larger the cast the more inherent pressure you have on the production. Even PD Kim Taeho at times struggled with the size of Infinite Challenge's cast, and I don't blame him for wanting to \"downsize\" that show into Yoo Jaesuk only -- hence Hangout with Yoo. The current PD just simply doesn't have it in him to handle this many permanent members.\n\nJung Junha has been all but invisible for the last months. \n\nShin Bongsun actually has taken the hand she was dealt and played very well with it. Once you put a costume on her she's legendary. However, the fact remains that she was dealt a poor hand. The show really doesn't allow her to shine.\n\nLee Yikyung has done an OK job. But he was outshined HARD in the Teen Top arc when he's put together with variety veterans like Yang Sehyung, Jo Seho, Nam Changhee, Yoo Byungjae etc. \n\nPark Jinjoo's departure is one that I really disagree with. Her character is unique. She won the Rookie Award last year and I think her future with the show would've been very promising. If somebody has to go here, I think HaHa should go in her place. This isn't a diss on HaHa -- he has done well. I just think it's such a pity losing Jinjoo here.\n\nLee Mijoo... what can I say. I've said on this sub before and I'll say it again: she's the real deal.",

For Yikyung with the exception of the last episode he\u2019s honestly been pretty invisible the past few months and might not suit the direction they want to go. For jinjoo, she\u2019s definitely improved but I get the sense that she\u2019s not ultimately going to pursue a variety career and focus more on acting. Both Yikyung and Jinjoo have gotten a good career boost from this though and i think they\u2019ll be fine. \n\nI do hope they don\u2019t \u2018replace\u2019 members though and go with the 3 of them with revolving guests, at least until the show gets a better understanding of what they want to do.",

Under the new PD's direction the power dynamics seemed a bit off.\n\nI dont get the impression the PD commanded as much respect from YJS which made some of his \"You will do this\" segments fall flat as the trust and faith didn't seem to be there in the same way as it was with the original PD.\n\nFelt a bit safe, a bit samey and a bit stale.\n\nHopefully the new format breathes some life into it again.   \n\n\nA smaller more focused cast might make project planning a bit easier. It should certainly make the dynamics and interactions a bit more fluid and fast moving.\n\nTrying to plan around such a large cast with mixed personalities and abilities was clearly a challenge.\n\nI do feel sorry for the outgoing cast members and I did actually enjoy them all in their individual moments but the blend has felt off for a while.\n\nHopefully they find a focus, direction and passion that resonates with a larger audience.",

Not the cast. \n\nMajor changes should not mean kicking people out but rather, working around the strength of the current cast. Do I think 7 people makes too big of a cast? Yes. But shows like 2D1N, RM, and even Going Seventeen made it work with the same number of people or even more. These shows have always played to the members' strengths and introduced projects/games inspired by the members. I don't recall current HDYP doing this.\n\nETA: Regarding Mina and Junha, I wish they were utilised more. Especially considering how they\u2019re veterans in the field. Now it seems like they\u2019ve been pushed to the back a lot these days. And Yikyung too. He was active when he first joined. Then slowly disappeared into the shadow. :(",

                    "comment": "I think the problem is that the cast of HDYP don't have that many overlapping strengths that compliment one another. To play up to one person's strength completely alienates another. I personally really like Bong Sun and know Junha from infinite challenge days, so i wish her and Junha had more opportunity to show how funny they are. That being said, there's quite an age and ability gap between them and the others. That's not an insult, its just that comedians in their 40s and 50s just don't have a ton of overlap with idols and actors in their 20s and early 30s. YJS is very unique in that he can blend in with almost any type of cast. \n\n2d1n and RM crew were both casted specifically for the type of show it is and to fill a certain role, which is why they mesh so well. For RM, we saw the growing pains some cast members went through as the show changed it took time (and the show almost ending) for them to work it out. HDYP cast just feels totally random and like YJS just picked some people he likes who happen to be free at that time. \n\nGoSe is interesting because it actually feels like a variety show with entertainers and not just a random thing thrown together for an idol group. But still, they are all on pretty even playing fields (for example there's not a huge gap in physical ability) and they're all round the same age with the same background so you don't get the awkward lack of commonality like you do with Junha and Mijoo.\n\nIt sucks because I think everyone on HDYP is talented and likeable, but they just don't make sense as a cast.",

Basically, the \u201cgeneral public\u201d. However, I feel like the age gap and therefore comedic style end up being visually huge and the show is paying the price for it. \n\nMina and Junha were never MZ style nor do they try and pretend to fit in like Haha. And then you have the legit MZs, Mijoo, Yikyung, Jinjoo. I honestly don\u2019t recall seeing Yikyung/Mijoo fooling around with Mina and Junha. Sometimes it feels like they\u2019re in 2 separate worlds. \n\nIt pains me to see the cast trying so hard. Not saying that casts from other shows don\u2019t work hard. But to see a previously esteemed and well loved show slowly crumbling really made me not interested in it as much. \n\nGose is definitely an outlier since they\u2019ve known each other for more than half their lives. I just couldn\u2019t think of a bigger cast. One thing I like about Gose is that the PDs actually listen to the members and know their inside jokes and games well. The PD and members work well together. On the other hand, HDYP appears as if the PD does whatever he wants, though course, we will never know if this is the case. Sometimes it feels like the PD killed Jaesuk\u2019s/the show\u2019s vibes. :(\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone wants the show to change at the expense of its members but here\u2019s to hoping that the show will pick up its pace. I will definitely miss Yikyung. Especially knowing that he can be crazy and crazy funny as seen on Sixth Sense, Lotto King, and his short RM appearance last week.",

I think the show should avoid music projects for awhile because they're just too easy. The problem with music project now is that everything is handed to them.",

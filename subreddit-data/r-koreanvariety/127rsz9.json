I think im this ep the focus was more about getting things done, which boy did they! but even when a guest recognizes Wooshik he has so much to do that he can't stay and chat with them about it. I remember in Youn's Stay he would stay and kinda just tell them how everyone's an actor and what they've been in. You only got that with that one group of men who were there till the end of their shift. \n\nhopefully the next ep with the half day we can see something more than them going through the motions of everything.",

I think he completes Seojin's awkwardness, haha. Yumi kimbap skill is probably level 100 now. It's nice to see how much she improves time-wise! Taehyung brightened my day (or night tbh) up with all his giggles and random smiles from time to time, haha. \n\nMy favourite scene from this episode is probably the group of five men? They were in awe, and understandably so! But, I wish they tried other dishes too, I want to see their reactions to like, tteokbokki etc",

It makes us appreciate him more and more \ud83d\ude06 (and the others too!)\n\nThat's a fair question! So, that difference happens because people don't always follow the current official (revised?) Romanization system for their names. They might be using another system or prefer to go with what's easier to pronounce for a foreigner. It's down to personal preference, really! That's why some people romanized \uc11c\uc900 name as either Seojun or Seojoon.\n\nPersonally speaking, I find Seojun a bit more pleasing to read, haha.",

But it also seems like its hard for him to join the others because he\u2019s the boss and much older. During the other seasons it was nice to see them hanging out together and interacting with the locals/customers. Youn Yuhjung left the kitchen to interact with customers and explain about the dishes but Seojun and V are mostly in the back. They don\u2019t seem to enjoy working that much.",

    "postText": "FYI, me and my brother usually watch Kshows during weekday meals (with our grandparents). We eat and do the dishes while watching it, then we pause it and restart it on the next meal. Even though there's TV on and the Kshows are English subbed, most of the times my grandma watches it with us (she's 87 yo and my grandpa is 82 yo).\n\nMy grandma watches dramas btw, subbed in our language. She loves it and now I know why she gets completely into it - she treats it as if everything was real. She gets annoyed and seriously upset with some evil characters but she gets totally excited whenever there's a fight going on. It's quite funny. Obviously, whenever we go to have dinner me and my grandpa (who aren't watching the drama) always get a full report of what happened in each episode she had watched on that day, how that made her feel, what she expected to happen, etc etc. She gets so passionate that my grandpa tells her it's not real, but it's something she immediately forgets afterwards (she just doesn't care).\n\nWhen it comes to variety shows, she has no clue on how those work. Let me share with you some of her moments, and then I will let you know who she loves in \u00abRunning Man\u00bb, \u00abMaster in the House\u00bb and \u00abThe Return of Superman\u00bb, which are the kshows we mostly watch (it has gotten to the point they recognize when cast members do \u00abcrossovers\u00bb on different kshows, or she recognize actors from some dramas she watched). I'm sharing it because I feel it's cute and can bring you a smile, just like it always happens with us. I wrote too much, though /sighs\n\nHere we go:\n\n1. She thinks everything is live. It's like they're shooting the show right on spot, and on the exact moment she watches it. So, she gets really surprised when the episode goes from day to night quickly (\u00abIt got dark so quickly, how's that possible?\u00bb), or whenever the cast members are doing sth - for example, eating food and talking - and we pause the episode to watch the next day (she's like: \u00abOmG, they eat too much! It's been a day, are they still eating??????!!!!!\u00bb or, when we change episodes and the episode starts in the morning, \u00abIs it morning already? Those guys are still there? Don't they take a rest?). I swear you I'm not kidding. It mostly happens on Master in the House, though.\n2. She doesn't get what they do for a living. This has happened twice when we were watching \u00abMaster In The House\u00bb. First, some months ago, she asked me how the members found time to go to work if they were recording this. I explained to her that they're working by participating in the show, and that they would film the episodes only for a day or two per week. Then, last week she asked me again: \u00abWill they stop being on the show if they get a job?\u00bb.\n3. Now seriously, screw the special effects teams on variety shows XDDDD They put some member's eyes on fire and give them HUGE ears. Do you have any idea on how shocked she gets? She's like \u00abWTF, that guy is on fire!!!\u00bb or \u00abThat man has huge ears, look at it, M\u00e1rio\u00bb (my grandpa's name). An example: [https://ibb.co/vZWNfcM](https://ibb.co/vZWNfcM) . Again, I swear I'm not kidding.\n4. You know, we started watching the 1st season of Busted but it's not really our thing. I did finish it, though, because I want to watch the 3rd season (with both LSG and LKS on it) and I really like YJS too. However, my grandparents love it. We watched the 3rd episode together (since it's on netflix, we have it subbed in our language) and my grandparents loved it - my grandpa loves a good mystery, while my grandma loves bloody things and Lee Kwang Soo HAHAHA So, on the 3rd episode of the show Lee Kwang Soo &gt;!is framed for murdering a girl!&lt;, right? I took a while to keep it up and watched some other show's episodes in the middle of it... That's why grandma went all deep into it and whenever she saw Lee Kwang Soo on Running Man she'd ask \u00abWhy is the guy there???? Wasn't he on the run? Was he acquitted?\u00bb and &gt;!\u00abWhat about the murdered girl? Was she found?\u00bb, being also shocked on the Busted epi whenever she saw the girl still dead on the bed even after some time passed.. But that's pretty understandable, not knowing what editing is!&lt;. On the other hand, my grandpa was so into it that he was trying to explain everything to her, and getting frustrated when she mentioned the episode on other kshows (because he'd say things over and over, but she keeps misunderstanding).\n\nUnfortunately, there have been funnier comments but I can't remember &gt;&lt; I should have written it.\n\nAnyway. Let me share with you one of the reasons I think Kshows are so amazing - You don't need to *understand it* to *enjoy it*. It's enough to see them playing, laughing, and observe their reactions. As I said, my grandparents don't usually understand any of it, but they like it. Especially my grandma, she gets totally engrossed - but to be fair, she'd watch a drama without subtitles and still be interested, she'd also narrate me what happened (or what she thinks it did). It makes me remember when I started watching Kdramas in 2010 and watched everything raw and then subbed later on... Even though my Korean skills were even more lacking than now, I was still able to understand many words and what was happening from the characters conversations, movements and behaviours. So I understand her.\n\nI think the show both my grandparents pay more attention to is \u00abThe Return of Superman\u00bb. They laugh their hearts out, have heated debates with each other about the children, they get totally into it. My grandma loves WillxBen siblings the most. She doesn't understand it's a show, though. She's always commenting how in Korea the fathers are the ones taking care of the children and doing house work and how we should be like that too, here. I think we explained her multiple times, even my grandpa did, but she doesn't understand that everything is made on purpose because of the show. Again, she just doesn't care about what we tell her, it's useless (haha).\n\nWhen we watch \u00abMaster in the House\u00bb after a while she sometimes asks us where the \u00abpretty boy\u00bb is... referring to Cha Eun Woo. That's how I actually notice she understands we are watching another show and she's recognizing what it is about (while my grandpa asks, when we watch other kshows, where are the two girls - aka Jihyo and Soomin - or comments how they have other girls - guests or masters - on the show instead). But, my grandma's favorite is actually Yang Se Hyung. She fell in love with him after seeing him cooking, she thinks he's husband material and really likes his comedy skills.\n\nAs for \u00abRunning Man\u00bb, it has all 4 of us laughing hard every time. Even my grandpa at times. What's funny is how my grandma reacts whenever Lee Kwang Soo appears. I'm seriously not exaggerating - there's a scene of all of members together on the show's opening, the poor guy just says good morning and my grandma is already yelling at the computer \u00abYOU GUYS BE CAREFUL WITH HIM. THAT GUY IS A CHEATER, HE WILL BETRAY YOU!\u00bb HAHAHAHA Sometimes they even choke while watching it, because they laugh so hard.\n\nI don't know if this was funny to you or only to me. Or even if you read everything - I'm sorry, I always try to write short texts but I can't ;\\_; I hope it could at least bring you bits of joy.",

I always wait for the meals time with antecipation, especially on Running Man's days, and with COVID-19 going on we're all working through home, so it gives us more family time. It helped us a lot :) My grandma is only mad about my grandpa spending all of his days at home because of Covid \ud83d\ude02 Since he used to work and now he's working from home too. But at the same time she's happy because Covid-19 means she won't have to kiss or hug anyone \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 She is over the moon with the fact my grandpa won't be pestering for kisses, or we not bothering her with hugs hahaha It's quite funny! \n\nSome years ago I even got my mother addicted to Asian dramas, so we watch some together as well. Same with my brother. My brother was never into dramas or kpop but since he plays games and watches korean streamers, he got familiar with it without my knowledge.. Then we started Running Man and fell in love with kshows. I had many issues and didn't feel connected to both of them, but we grew closer thanks to it. \n\nI remember when I felt such an outsider because of my hobbies. Not even my family could understand it, the only one I got to watch dramas with me was my grandma (because she literally can watch anything and get amusement from it, I wasn't worried). I felt lonely. Now I feel accompanied and understood, at least. \n\nI hope you can find someone who can watch it with you. And, you know, I'm always here if you want to watch something online or comment, through chat or audios. If you ever need a drama or kshow friend, I'm here \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Whenever there's something bloody, I tell her not to watch it and cover her eyes with my hand, but she hits me and watches it LOL I need to cover her eyes because I tell her to close her eyes and she pretends to, leaving those a bit opened. She regrets it at night because she either has a nightmare from those, or she can't fall asleep because of it.\n\nIt's also very funny to watch her explain everything to my poor grandpa who just came to the living room to take a rest after a long day and wants to watch TV... He's like \"I don't know a thing, I'm not watching this, but she doesn't get quiet\". No matter how he tells her  to let him watch TV, she listens to it then 10 minutes later she will forget it and talk again. But usually my grandpa gets into it too, as she's watching in my tablet and they sit together.\n\nOh and she yells. I'm working and I just hear her cursing or exclaiming things to the drama characters as if they could listen to her.\n\nShe also has a story of her own for each drama. She misunderstands things and create a plot of her own. Sometimes because she can't read the subtitles well enough, I think. The best thing I remember was how the main lead boy was trying to save the main lead girl from falling off the cliff and she yells \"Be careful, he's trying to kill you!\" \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I'm like... \"He's not trying to kill her, he's trying to save her.\" \ud83e\udd23\n\nThank you so much for your comment! If I have more, I will post it on this reddit then. Promise \ud83d\udc4c",

                    "comment": "Mine is 87 yo! She also has trouble with eyesight, she is waiting for operation. She doesn't even read anymore because of it :(\n\nMy grandma reads subtitles if I put the tablet or computer in front of her.. I used to put it on TV but then saw her standing up to go near because she couldn't read it (when she was over excited), so I decided to use something else. I just tell her to keep a bit of a distance.\n\nTo be fair, my grandma would watch anything even without subtitles as long as there's movement. Now I'm sure she watched many dramas I put on TV without understanding some of the talking. But Ive noticed that she sometimes can't follow how quick subtitles are, and I feel bad about it. \n\nSo, talking shows aren't probably a good idea. I'd tell you to choose some shows with movements and a lot of things going on. TROS is also a good idea, even my grandpa watches it even though there aren't subs for them.\n\nAs for kdramas, just look for one interesting. In my case I got lucky because my grandma watches everything, from soccer to weird movies. It's rare of her to refuse watching unless it's horror - and she watches violent stuff and then tells me it's my fault she had nightmares and not to put her again LOL I tell her to close her eyes but she doesn't, then she gets angry haha\n\nBut maybe putting an interesting and soft one, also if you can, put the subtitles bigger (on viki you can do it if you're watching from the computer, but not through tablet or chrome cast :/). Tell me your experience later :)\n\nP. S. If you're unsure, you may watch an episode with her and try to speak the lines you read just for her, and check how she understands it.",

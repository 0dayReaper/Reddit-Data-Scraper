    "postText": "[Episode 95](https://youtu.be/AWNmTbayO_U) is the final episode. \n\nThis is unexpected, but also not surprising if you have been following Jessi for a while. I am glad she is prioritising her health, but also sad to see the show go\u2026\n\nI first started watching showterview two years ago right at the start and have been hooked ever since. It was my gateway into Korean variety. It also made me laugh during the hardest times of the pandemic. It broke new ground in the variety circuit.\n\nSo thank you Jessi, Jungshik, Showterview PD and staff for making such a wonderful show and for making us laugh so hard. \u2764\ufe0f",

Although, I completely understand where she's coming from, as she's booked and busy on variety shows. Hopefully Jungshik is able to find new opportunities as well.",

She had to stop her Zoom promotion early because it was causing her too much fatigue. She\u2019s been posting IV drips on her insta story pretty regularly too :/. As for her mental health, she\u2019s had it pretty rough over the pandemic tbh. Still, i hope she gets better and i hope we get to see her MC another season or show like this when the time comes",

Showterview was a breath of fresh air in the Korean variety scene, especially for online talk shows.\n\nLike what you said, her health should come first and hopefully nothing serious is happening behind the scenes. (I'm quite concerned about the health of the P Nation artists in general, but that's a topic for another day.) \n\nI hope she finds the rest she needs, comes back stronger than ever before, and she will continue to make regular appearances in the Korean entertainment scene in some form or another.",

TBH the show shoulda went on a hiatus for her comeback and a while after her having COVID to better recover. But this is fine too. \n\nI'd hope the void left gets filled by someone but honestly, who is anything like Jessi? Her Americanness, being respected by her guests, being idolized by the female idols who come on and so on. She is unique. No one else could be sexual, curse, push confidence &amp; self love like her on a show. All while often being funny, disarming and a giant softy at heart.",

He ran (?) his mouth predicted and underestimated that the team won't go pass round 16 and mimicked the coach too. It was quite an issue and people said his opinion can lower the team's spirit and he was criticized a lot. That's why if you noticed he posted IG stories congratulated Korea team when they got to round 16, but some people still wanted him to make a public apology. That's why Seyoon said Im cheol pretended to be a soccer expert XD They're really poked him in his sore spot\ud83d\ude02",

I do think he left the show too early, celebrities always left their shows right before enlistment but it's different in Ravi's case.\n\nBut for Ravi to return, the show needs to thrive at first. If the show is still ongoing until his discharge date in July 2024, the possibility is higher, provided that no other issues happens.",

It really doesn\u2019t feel that Seonho is a new member at all, it feels like he\u2019s been here for months \ud83e\udd23. \n\nAlso, Junghoon\u2019s getting funnier and funnier every episode \ud83e\udd23 the elder has really fully come out of his shell \ud83e\udd23. At this rate, he\u2019ll probably beat Jongmin in being the funniest member aka my favorite cast \ud83e\udd23. I\u2019m hoping that he stays with Jongmin forever in 2D1N and let them be fossils together \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nI\u2019m excited for next week\u2019s episode, the squid game go stop game preview was funny \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

It happened when Seyoon was left out in the rest area when In woo bought the meal for him. It's such a great strategy if the first one tried to find as much ornament as he can so the next one can have it easier, but as we know there's none of them who are really the 'brain' of the group, everyone is just a fool, too many fools in this show\ud83d\ude05 This bunch of guys tends to win the mission straight mindedly, they rarely have tricks whatsoever\ud83d\ude05I feel a lil bad for In woo and his clumsy good deed, why didn't he told Jongmin what he did\ud83d\ude05 When Junghoon sensed something was wrong and asked In woo about it, I felt shiver, In woo is really pure\ud83d\ude02",

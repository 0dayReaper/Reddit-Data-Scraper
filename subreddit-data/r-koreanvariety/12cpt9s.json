    "postText": "'Peak Time' is a brand-new idol competition program in which teams battle for the chance to become the next worldwide idol group. Unlike other audition programs, its contestants consist entirely of male idols who have already debuted, whether currently active or part of a disbanded group.\n\nOnly the top 6 finalists would be able to reveal their group name on the show, and those 6 teams would be participating in a \u201cPeak Time\u201d concert tour. The final winner will receive a grand prize of 300 million won (approximately $232,932), as well as the opportunity to release a new album and hold a global showcase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Originals Match Round**\n\nThe contestants competed with songs of their very own. Every team was given a brand-new song that now belongs to their group. The top two teams from last week's rankings were given the chance to divide all ten teams into two leagues, A and B, with the five teams within each league competing against one another. The winner earns 3% of the total votes.\n\nLeague A\n\n|Team|Performance|Judges Score|Audience Score|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2:00 (&gt;!NTX!&lt;)|[Circuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBiVJjsD3H4)|&gt;!700!&lt;|&gt;!380!&lt;|\n|7:00 (&gt;!MASC!&lt;)|[Doesn't Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7jwFuxe6bA)|&gt;!800!&lt;|&gt;!340!&lt;|\n|20:00 (&gt;!M.O.N.T!&lt;)|[Like We've Never Been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMFUujpSRA4)|&gt;!600!&lt;|&gt;!200!&lt;|\n|24:00 (&gt;!SOLOISTS!&lt;)|[Be Mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_Avai65fmo)|&gt;!400!&lt;|&gt;!570!&lt;|\n|11:00 (&gt;!VANNER!&lt;)|[Skyscraper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO0mxjFYXzU)|&gt;!800!&lt;|&gt;!710!&lt;|\n\nLeague B\n\n|Team|Performance|Judges Score|Audience Score|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|8:00 (&gt;!DKB!&lt;)|[Coco Colada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA9rqpitx58)|&gt;!800!&lt;|&gt;!680!&lt;|\n|23:00 (&gt;!DGNA!&lt;)|[Chamomile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyHEIDDnWtQ)|&gt;!800!&lt;|&gt;!440!&lt;|\n|15:00 (&gt;!BLK!&lt;)|[Nothin' Without You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih5Pd8r_9zI)|&gt;!400!&lt;|&gt;!130!&lt;|\n|13:00 (&gt;!BAE173!&lt;)|[Criminal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCoz9qL-l28)|&gt;!700!&lt;|&gt;!590!&lt;|\n|14:00 (&gt;!GHOST9!&lt;)|[Fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXwoDQMjnik)|&gt;!400!&lt;|&gt;!360!&lt;|",

Vocally though, team 07:00 was just amazing. I got tired just watching them sing and dance. The breathwork and stamina it takes to stay on pitch for a whole routine especially with them being a duo was genuinely another level. Would\u2019ve been much easier in a group where you only have a few lines instead of the whole song.",

Later this day many days later, my intrusive tought often winning over by making me randomly whispering coco-colada to myself, then following up with random noise imitating that drop and random dance that really just like fish out of the water.",

Practicing so long just to have a member leave and with 5 days only to get everything together...\n\nAnd totally no ranking reveals this week. Next ep will be the top 6 announcements, behinds and probably the finals concept reveal!  (I really don't get why they left 6th and 7th place blank just to give the \"???\" as well at the end like \ud83d\ude12)\n\nAlso glad that the controversy for karam didn't get them removed or anything lol.",

            "comment": "Team 7 and 8 were the best for me for their respective leagues. I really liked Skyscraper but for some reason, team 11 looked very stiff and a bit stifled. Honestly, this round had almost all teams acting much more nervous than usual. I guess the reality of top 6 and eliminations must've gotten to them. I don't see team 11 not winning the whole thing at this point but am still interested to see most of the teams give their best for the remainder of the show.\n\nAlso, news seems to be pointing towards Team 23 \"voluntarily\" leaving. JTBC hasn't made a statement which I thought meant they didn't think the \"scandal\" was worth much but given how the members have acted on social media after the scandal broke out, I have a serious fear that they're going to be gone and the show will likely move on without commenting on it much. It also seems like JTBC is straddling the line hoping they can more or less quietly release them since they don't want it to affect the rest of the show. \n\nI mean, even I was slightly disappointed in Karam for smoking (and only because I'm concerned how that'll affect his singing and health, not the \"pure\" image nonsense) but didn't think the drinking and AV gf was an issue at all. Thus, if this non-issue was what shattered an otherwise good run from DGNA, I would super disappointed. The reason I liked Peak Time over Boy's Planet despite the popularity of the latter was because it's supposed to be drama-free and focused on the effort and skills from underappreciated groups. Team 23 was my pick for exactly this reason and if they are leaving cuz of Karam's news, I'm considering just checking out of the show and watching the final perfs.",

The new songs as a whole were \u201cokay\u201d but none had that wow factor that makes you want to go back and listen again. \n\nAs for the final 6: Teams 11/8 are pretty much secured at this point with the benefit points. 24 and 23 have the popularity (assuming garam\u2019s \u201cscandal\u201d blows over, which i hope it does). Which leaves two more slots: I think it\u2019ll be between: Teams 7, 13, and 2.",

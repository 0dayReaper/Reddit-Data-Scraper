They even point out that it was the filming location for Transit Love 2 (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc5602\ucd2c\uc601\uc9c0).\n\nEdit: If you search for (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc5602\ucd2c\uc601\uc9c0) in google, a ton of the filming locations show up, including the house in Pyeongchang-dong.\n\nEdit 2: Oddly, The Namu.wiki [Transit Love 2](https://namu.wiki/w/%ED%99%98%EC%8A%B9%EC%97%B0%EC%95%A0%202) page doesn't list any of the locations.  But it's still a good chunk of \"extra\" info about the cast, and the show.",

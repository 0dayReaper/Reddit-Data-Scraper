And it seems like Ayumi is really the enemy of every team. She's really good at what she does. She's that goalie who really learned from her mistake.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I am still amazed at how FC Giants closed the gap. From 3-0 to 3-2 so the loss is less bitter than their previous landslide loss to FC National Family. Kim Seorin still need lessons on how to handle the ball. She really missed a lot of chances.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And there's a high likely that FC Top Girl would take the championship and it's crazy how every league there's a new champion team. Do you guys think that if ever FC Top Girl manage to be champions will they be able to defend their title or it'll be another FC Fire Moth and FC National Family?!&lt;",

Kathy has an injury, so that might be the issue, but not sure what's affecting Irene's performance. After this match we can be sure now that Ayumi FC TopGirl is the winner of golden globe this season.",

                    "comment": "Fc TopGirl is currently the most stable and consistent team. It looks like they decide how the game will go. The fact that they turned off their engines after HyunI got hurt and still able to defend for more than 10 minutes of play was just amazing. They stick to their style of plays and slow down the tempo to suit their way of playing. With Ayumi at the backend, they know that they can hold out if they decided to. They're not panicking at all throughout the match. It's possible that they can defeat FC WorldClass. FC WorldClass is more skilled and speedy but they are easily flustered when they are not scoring. Also it looks like they don't know how to manage their energy to last the whole game if situation calls for it. They burned up high and fast. Once they do that they make easy stupid mistakes that lead to goal.\nIt will be an interesting match next time between TG and WC.",

            "comment": "My personal highlights and thoughts:  \n\n1. DaYoung is not only adorable but hilarious. The schooling comments, the secret food discussion and the shadow hiding. \n2. Hanae with the \"Oh shit\" when she fell down during warm ups. Haha. \n3. Whoa, Yubin! Has she leveled up? Of course you never know when a kick is going to be accurate by an inaccurate player but the next few kicks on goal were relatively on target too. Then there was that play where Dayoung passes back to Yubin who takes it forward, pass a defender, dribbles down the middle then passes to BoKyung who takes a shot/passes to DaYoung. That was awesome!\n4. Irene definitely doesn't seem on the same level defending shots on the goal as she used to be. I don't know why. If it was just this game it could be stiffness from being in heels as she said she was the day before for 4 hours but it's been multiple games if not all season. \n5. The accuracy of Hyunyi's shots and BoKyung's shots is really good, and with power. First Hyunyi takes a strong, accurate shot on goal from a kick-in (which Ayumi blocks perfectly) and then like a minute later BoKyung shoots directly from a kick-in and scores Top Girls third goal. \n6. The build up from the far back, with underhanded passes from the goalie, are getting pressed and becoming dangerous. I liked seeing, in game, the goalies adapt by punting the ball and overhand passing it to the mid field. \n7. My goodness, Top Girl **really** needed to find a counter or make an adjustment so KyungHee wouldn't keep cutting the ball away from BoKyung when it is passed to her. Every single time she'd run up on BoKyung from behind and steal the ball away when it was being passed to BoKyung. \n8. I wonder if Top Girl's manager was telling them to talk more in the second half but they just didn't do it. They were so good at communicating in the first half then it disappeared. \n9. Seems like while other players are progressing, BoKyung recently hasn't taken much of a step forward in her ball skills. You'd think with her amateur experience plus all this time playing for Top Girl she'd be even on Seogi's level or not far from Lee Jung-eun last time we saw her. She's not getting by defenders, dribbling or making outstanding plays any better than she was last season I don't think. \n10. Oh man, if adorable blonde pigtailed DaYoung had at the end there scored that goal while all alone I would have stood up and cheered. Lol.",

            "comment": "Regarding comments about certain players regressing in the last couple of episodes I believe its due to schedules finally being fully ramped up after COVID restrictiond ending.\n\nThey also probably dont get alot of rest and sleep before the shoots, so all the fatigue and stress add up as football is also a very mental/creative sport.\n\nIt's just that some players are physically beasts/gifted like HyeSun, HeIn etc. and don't need much to keep fitness and form. I feel like Yubin surprisingly is also one of them: she kept up training and improving while also doing the very taxing Second World show with MoonByul who needed to drop out of Shooting (but she in hindsight also had an Xmas album and some other crazy schedule lined up, MooMoos are well fed as always :D)",

Irene (FC Gucheok) seems to lost her instinct and reflex which probably due to not keeping up with her skills. Kathy (FC World) lost her aggressive play and \"reads\". She did have an injury back to back so that probably would affect her play. Nami (FC Gavengers) are basically non existent for her team. She is still not grasping the flow of the game now since every players are more skilled. She cant seems to find her groove. Is because being a new bride? I know that's a bs excuse. I think it is more of the time you spend on soccer skills and practice. We saw how basically everyone leveled up, especially FC TopGirl and so does FC Anaconda.",

Irene clearly doesn't look as sharp now as the beginning of SL and I bet Kathy couldnt train much due to injuries and was also told by PD/coach to tone down her agression to reduce chance of injuries. If you contrast that with Ayumi, she's a tryharding beast since forever and even delayed her honeymoon to shoot an episode a few days after her wedding. \n\nHowever some players like NaMi, the iceskater on NatFam, KISUM and a couple of others really didnt improve or got worse over time. It might not be just a lack of training but also about getting 'found out' as a player and team. WW was always the youngest team with most energy and speed, but other teams learned to just outplay them and exploit their huge defensive gaps. NaMi was atfirst fine dribbling past 'n00bs' but now has to fight a tight man marker whos just as fast as her but with more strength (not so difficult :D). \n\nI don't really blame them as their short main careers deserve to have higher prio, but it does stick out to viewers of the show and is painful to look at.",

They are unpredictable, also it is satisfying to see the growth of your favorite team and individual growth of your favorite player. That's why it is kind of maddening when they are not progressing the way that you want them too. I always rooted for FC Top Girl and FC Anaconda from their trial matches. You can see that they have the understanding of the game but of course they don't have the skill and fitness to do anything about it. However, you can clearly saw their progresses as each games came along. It is because they worked hard and their desire were there on the screen. FC Gucheok was like that from the beginning of the show. That is why FC Actionista is also a threatening team because of the mentality to improve themselves was ingrained from the original players. These teams above show that they can be entertaining while having the desires to improve themselves. Most of the other teams might lucked out in the beginning, but if they are not willing to invest into it, they are no longer a contender. FC Bullabang and FC Gukdae were an example of that. FC Wonder Woman might have the energy but they lacked the seriousness to be a threat. After all, it is the effort that you put out that matters.",

Also battle of the 2 best GKs in the league. \n\nWhat a great goal by yubin! \n\nAyumi is killing it as usual\n\nWoooooow 3-0 lead! That kick-in goal by BK was nice. Irene seems to be a bit off today. Is Ayumi the best GK now?\n\nThat was a rough hit to Hyun-yi's eye \ud83d\ude2c \n\nAwwww hyun-yi's first goal while vision impaired \ud83e\udd7a\n\nThe giants were so extra after seo rin's goal \ud83d\ude02 i love them. Awww it was her first ever goal that's why.\n\nAlso excited to see how much better kyung hee gets over time bc she has improved so much already! Super solid defence this game.\n\nUgh hyun-yi's last attack would have made such a great equalizer \n\nGiants played so well w no sub for the second half and only one good eye for hyun-yi \n\nI feel like ayumi won that game for them. Giants made wayyyy more shots and she saved almost all of them. \n\nWatching hyun-yi do her interviews w her eye patch is cracking me up \ud83d\ude48\n\nDamn gav vs FM next week looks good",

Luckily she did scored a goal and not causing problem for her team. That is someone who is committed to the sport.\n\nI think FC Gucheok has a better chance of beating FC Actionista for the semifinal. All their players are skilled enough and physically more aggressive. Yoon Young and Ji In (FC Actionista) would not stand a chance at all. Just hoping that HeIn can leveled up one more time. But if FC Gucheok close her off, Actionista will have a big problem. Young Jin (FC Actionista) will not be able to handle the three big front of FC Gucheok (HyunYi, Keong Hee and SeoRin). Of course, Irene GC is better than MoonYoung AC in term of experience. We know Actionista doesn't play penetrating defense since they lost HyeJin. They were lucky enough to beat FC WorldClass with their outside shooting and WC missed opportunities. We saw how WC controlled the whole game.",

But they need to work more on their passes and first touch because they look so lost, once they had the ball and pass back just to get intercepted and getting counter attack from &gt;!Giants!&lt;. If they improve on it they can make &gt;!Kim Bo Kyung!&lt; a playmaker because &gt;!Yubin and Chae Ri Na!&lt; can shoot but still lacks of first touch and ball handling.\n\nFor &gt;!Giants!&lt; everything they need to do to from pass play that gave them success on past, to pressing on front by using their physique to create chances. However too many chances slipped and lack of finishing burdens them until time catch them up to defused the comeback. They're still room for improvement for &gt;!Cha Soo Rin and Heo Kyung Hee!&lt; because once they solve the first touch and finishing problem they'll became oppressive from mid esp &gt;!Heo Kyung Hee!&lt;, she can run as hell - useful for long balls and pass plays.\n\n[I swear after watching Morocco and Croatia, defense wins the game as long you're ***mad consistent*** on parking the bus and then if you had a chance to slipped an counter attack from opening in transition of your opponent you can win it like how Japan went behind from Germany and Spain or how Costa Rica beat Japan after parking the bus in whole 80+ min by 1-0.]",

And on top of that the games aren't exactly variety television friendly when all you have is all players spending time on one side of the field.  \n\nWatching this match there were moments of brilliance and moments of horrible play.  All in all there was good drama and offensive chances from both teams.  I enjoyed it, got to see the \"Pirate HyunYi\" hahaha",

            "comment": "It was an exciting game nonetheless. Also loved the secrets of idols lives being shared. It so funny and sad at the same time.\nAnyway, it is clear that FC TopGirl was a better team. They were so calm and collected through the whole match. Sticking with their game plans, with fewer mistakes compared to previous matches. I believed that they \"close the kitchen early\" after HyunI got hurt. Coach JinChul always went easy on their opponent once they knew they controlled the game. (Last season WorldClass vs Gucheok, and this season TopGirl vs Gukdae). Which can be very dangerous.Hopefully he would go for a total annihilation of the opposing team.\nThis game was played in October, and hopefully DaYoung improved a lot since. Looks like she still not confident enough to assist her team. They will need her especially we know the fitness level of TopGirl.\nGucheok still needs to work on their mentality.  It's great to see that they recovered that the second half. I think they will have a better odd in beating Actionista. They are more physical, aggressive, speedy and better defensively.  Overall skill levels are also better than Actionista and also have a deeper pool of 6th man.",

It'll be an interesting match up but HeIn might not be easily contained.  Irene needs to be the difference maker in that game where she failed versus TopGirl.\n\nI actually would love to see TopGirl go undefeated and win it all.  They developed from absolute terrible newbies to a team that is cohesive and very vocal in their communication.  MiYeon and DaYoung are their weaker players but their positioning is better than the other lower rated players.  Those girls just need to work on their technical skills now.  I loved it when DaYoung still followed the play where BoKyung hit the post.  She went a bit too deep and could've lagged a bit for a better position on the deflection but if she has the positioning down now it will get easier for her later.  Imagine if that was MoonByul that most likely would've been another goal.",

                            "comment": "FC Actionista have 3 good players, but basically that's it. FC Gucheok has a deeper pool to play with since SeoRin, HaeNa and that other girl have a better skill and understanding of the game. Goalkeeper Irene is still #2 keeper behind Ayumi, and that give them a better chance at defeating Actionista. If they can neutralize HeIn, the game will flow for FC Gucheok. \nI would also love to see FC TopGirl goes  undefeated. They are a much more stable and smarter player than FC World Class. Only option for FC World Class is to go with a fast paced game plan. If FC TopGirl manages to outscore them early in the game, mentally WC will collapse. They are easily flustered and makes stupid mistakes. These don't happen with TG. They were more collected and always stick with their game plan. \nThe X factor will be how Coach Choi JinChul feels about handling WC since it was his team for 2 seasons.\nI would love to see FC TopGirl vs FC WorldClass for the final since they are my favorite teams, but too bad it will not happen this season. Either way it will be an amazing matches for semi and final.",

If he play it down on purpose, it makes it felt kind of condescending towards Giants cus they were really trying their best on their own not because opp team 'let them have it' :(",

But I would love to see TG prove me wrong from my earlier comments and take it all the way. They still have the best GK and Yubin is really developing as a player they can rely on as well. Her and RiNa are both decent 2 way players at this point. The only time the opponents can take advantage is when they pass it to MiYoun/DaYoung. Both have some spatial sense but just can't physically keep up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChallenge league next week should be exciting, stakes seem very high there.",

Coach Choi Jin Chul is always close to Gucheok and play nice against apposing team. Remember previous season FC World Class vs FC Gucheock, and this season FC Top Girl vs FC Gukdae. Once they see they were overpowering the other team, they started to slow down their offense. We just need DaYoung to improve quickly to help TG since fitness wise, Min Young can't handle the whole game.",

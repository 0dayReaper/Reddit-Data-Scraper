    "postText": "Anyone know any Korean TV providers that\u2019s easy to use for the elderly in the US? Looking to find a Korean only TV channel provider that\u2019s affordable. This is for my grandma who only cares for Korean TV. We have Verizon but the plan is too expensive. We\u2019ve tried something like Ondemandkorea but that\u2019s too hard for my grandma to navigate. She can\u2019t navigate via streaming or find channels herself via search. She can however memorize her favorite channels on a remote which is what she was doing with Verizon channels. Thank you!",

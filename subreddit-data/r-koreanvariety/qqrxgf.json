    "postText": "[Soompi](https://www.soompi.com/article/1497830wpp/lovelyzs-mijoo-in-talks-to-sign-with-antenna-following-departure-from-woollim)\n\nLovelyz\u2019s Mijoo is working on finding a new agency!\n\nIt was announced earlier in the month that seven of eight Lovelyz members are leaving Woollim Entertainment when their contract expires on November 16.\n\nOn November 10, it was reported that Mijoo will be signing with Antenna.\n\nIn response to the report, a source from Antenna clarified, \u201cWe met with Lovelyz\u2019s Mijoo recently, but nothing has been confirmed yet.\u201d\n\nFounded by Yoo Hee Yeol, Antenna houses stars including Sam Kim, Kwon Jin Ah, Lee Jin Ah, Jung Seung Hwan, Jukjae, and more. Yoo Jae Suk, who has worked with Mijoo on programs including \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d and \u201cHow Do You Play?,\u201d also signed with Antenna in July of this year.\n\nStay tuned for updates!\n\n---------\nYoo Jae Suk can finally collect the comedienne fees from her! On a serious note though, I'm so glad she's getting recognized from the industry, meeting agencies and continues to stay booked in variety shows",

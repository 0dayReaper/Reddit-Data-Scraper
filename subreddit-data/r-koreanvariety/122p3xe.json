                    "comment": "\nHan Gun Kyu is a good goalkeeper, not gonna lie. He blocked a few goals from Lim Nam Kyu and Mo Tae Bum. And he's the only GK who survived.\n\nYu Ri An put a good fight as centerback. He even committed foul at the start of the game just to stop Nam Kyu, and he's great at pulling defence lines. got few offside foul by Eojjeoda members.\n\nPark Yong Un- Good midfielder. Ex-soccer player from high school if I'm not mistaken. And you know what? His soccer team had a match with Eojjeoda Avengers before. He was the team captain at that time. You can refer to ep76 or ep4/2023 on netflix.\n\nThere are two Target Man for the 2nd audition, Kim Yong Sik and the bald MMA guy (I dont remember his name). MMA guy has strong physiques, but I'm not sure about Kim Yong Sik, he doesnt show his potential much in the 2nd audition (or I'm too focused on Captain Nam Kyu\ud83d\ude05)\n\nLee Jun Yi is a fast runner. I forgot his position, tho. He's my bias out of the 10 contestants. They called them maknae, and he is so adorable. Would want to see more of his potential. (You can see that he is my bias out of the 10)\n\nTo answer your question (sorry for the long reply\ud83d\ude05),\nfor me, all 10 contestants seem to have basic skills, which surprised  me. All I can say is the match went well for them. The ball passing is quite smooth between players given that they are from diff. sport. \n\nReport Finished\ud83d\ude01",

I'm noob with korean language so didn't really get the overall standing.\n\nHmmm. Yes, the new contestants are promising! I hope yu ri an passes the 3rd audition, he's good at handling fellow defenders (is he that tall guy?!)\n\n\nI hope manager ahn accepts them all when the players report for their respective main sports.",

My guts kinda tell me he passed the audition tho cause Lim Nam Kyu, Heo Min Ho, Kang Chil Ku, Kim Jun Hyeon followed him on Insta. I mean if he's not I might be just delusional here.\n\nHere is his Insta:\nhttps://instagram.com/__rian____u?igshid=OGRjNzg3M2Y=",

    "postText": "Does anyone have good recs for Chinese or Korean dating shows? I started Heart Signal just for a fun show in the background and was hooked to the Chinese versions! I prefer them over the Korean actually.\nUnfortunately, Viki only had seasons 1, 2, and 5 and I can't find eng subs for 3 and 4. Are there any other dating shows you recommend??\nPreferably something on a lighter note like HS or Singles Inferno. I found Love Catcher to be too intense and heartbreaking for me.",

The cast are students and the supposedly 'drama' is not farfetched nor dragged by the production team.\n\nI also recommend **Falling in Love Like a Romantic Drama** (Seasons 1-3 on Netflix) which is not Korean but Japanese, but it does not feel that staged. This might be because it  there is a stage for acting. The show consists of acting workshops with strangers and the best acting pair gets reenact the scene ending with a kiss.",

            "comment": "Nice, some of us really prefer the Chinese version of Heart Signal, particular Season 2 and now Season 5.\n\nSome other notable dating shows: **Terrace House, Shanghai Sharelife, Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81), Heart Signal (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110), EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560), Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac), and Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774)**.\n\nFor Heart Signal, yes the original Korean version and some seasons of the Chinese version should be on Viki. For the first season of the Korean version, it's on OnDemandKorea.\n\nWith the Chinese version of Heart Signal, it's available on the WeTV/Tencent Video website (has English subs), and also their WeTV/Tencent Video channels on Youtube for free but without proper English subs.\n\nWith the Tencent Video Youtube channel you'll have to use auto-translate from Chinese/Mandarin or maybe say Thai, Vietnamese, etc. So for English subs you have to check their own WeTV/Tencent Video/etc. website.\n\nThere's also Heart Signal Japan from the Japanese streaming service called ABEMA but nobody has picked it up yet, so no English subs and you'll have to use OCR/machine translation and such. This is Heart Signal Japan from the ABEMA Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2DWOkvRPRQ\n\n---\n\nDefinitely look into Terrace House and Shanghai Sharelife if you haven't already. They're the classics.\n\n**This is the actual start for Shanghai Sharelife, click the Amara (for English subs by ShibaSubs) links**: https://www.reddit.com/r/Shanghaisharelife/comments/lyvgdg/episode_1_english_subs/\n\n**If you haven't watched the original first season of Terrace House, this is kinda how to watch Terrace House: Boys x Girls Next Door: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zfkwnq/how_do_i_watch_boys_girls_next_door/izchnov/**\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and more info on where to watch them**: https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/1069rre/singles_inferno_is_my_favorite_show/j3fmqon/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zyn2y0/regarding_the_popularity_of_the_different_dating/j2a8bok/\n\n**Some Korean/Chinese variety shows that have romance elements, and also Kdramas/Cdramas with slice of life and so on**: https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/1069rre/singles_inferno_is_my_favorite_show/j3fn4tj/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/1069rre/singles_inferno_is_my_favorite_show/j3fo7a5/\n\n**Overview about shows like Single's Inferno, Heart Signal (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110), Terrace House, Shanghai Sharelife, Love Catcher (Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac) and Love Catcher 2), and Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774), also EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560)**: https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/106wwu2/they_should_have_a_korean_show_similar_to_love/j3k9pa0/?context=10000 and https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/106wwu2/they_should_have_a_korean_show_similar_to_love/j3kba2u/\n\n---\n\nOne of the new dating shows will also be on Netflix, it's called **Nineteen to Twenty (\uc5f4\uc544\ud649\uc2a4\ubb3c)** or 19/20, check these threads for more info: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/102skks/nineteen_to_twenty_1920_a_new_netflix_youth/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/102r1di/nineteen_to_twenty_korean_version_of/\n\nThat show is about high school students graduating or something like that, so it'll be lighter and less intense, probably.\n\n---\n\nWhich reminds me of **Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81)**. It's kinda like Ainori Love Wagon but in China. \n\nBtw, Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey and African Journey are available on international Netflix. And it has way older seasons (from the 2000s) that have no English subs and are only available in Japanese Netflix/sites. Ainori is a more raw, fast-paced, etc. show, it's really fun though.\n\nAnyway, there's no doubt that Twinkle Love is one of the best shows for coming of age trips/events. Sorta like Terrace House: Boys &amp; Girls in the City youthfulness.\n\nBasically for Twinkle Love they're university students that are having a field trip, lol. So they get missions, dates, et cetera.\n\nTwinkle Love has a lot of friendships formed in the show, you get to see bromances, sismances, etc.\n\nAs in it's one of the best shows for platonic friendships and all that, and you can see them shipping each other and so on, lmao. Like OMG (with NewJeans: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZAgIHmHLdc), they're so meta with Twinkle Love sometimes.\n\nIt's also a great show if you want to go back/forward to that freshness of young adult life ([btw, flamingos and parrots are geese] (https://www.reddit.com/r/heartsignal/comments/ns11y8/friends_share_life_terrace_house_twinkle_love/)).\n\n**For Twinkle Love, at the end of each day they have to record a message for the person they liked/spent time the most. And listen to their own message (through earbuds) IN FRONT OF EVERYONE, so it's kinda dramatic af, lol.**\n\n---\n\nChinese dating shows, more so with YOUKU shows, have a lot of extra bonus content. \n\nLike Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81) has a no panelists version, livestream watch parties with the housemates, unreleased scenes for the episode, et cetera. Imagine if we all understood Mandarin or like if Chinese characters were easily autotranslated.\n\n**Twinkle Love Season 1 Episode 1**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxP-Ye9kr24\n\nTwinkle Love Season 1 Episode 1 Extended (no English subs and without panelists): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA3fghMcrag\n\nTwinkle Love Season 1 fan playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxP-Ye9kr24&amp;list=PLqaEvwXntk0zpIQfTl67iCXDt-WNV7z9f\n\nTwinkle Love Season 1 official Youku playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxP-Ye9kr24&amp;list=PLATwx1z00HscJm1x0dopDc6sYgL5ifmey\n\nBelow are the livestreams from the housemates, no English subs though.\n\nFei Er and Ah Zhou: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8la4nDNEg6w\n\nYa Ya, Hui Hui, Fei Er, Bo Bo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9sp1kwam-M\n\nAh Zhou, Bo Bo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s8ef11SrjY\n\nFei Er, Bo Bo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s8ef11SrjY\n\n---\n\n**Twinkle Love Season 2 Episode 1 Part 1**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78vUkTAhuG8\n\nTwinkle Love Season 2 Episode 1 Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFBC-aR2tmk\n\nTwinkle Love Season 2 Episode 1 Bonus Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtAO9BegW_w\n\nTwinkle Love Season 2 official Youku playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB_lie3fxsakhZTX8xj8kxpSpa3zsVEmG\n\nBtw, forgot to mention it, but there's also members-only bonus episodes on Youtube, they're usually ~15-20 minutes long.\n\nTwinkle Love Season 2 official Youku playlist for trailers, behind the scenes, and clips: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB_lie3fxsan6V5CNuu8hR6GKdnmatY6h\n\n---\n\nAnother really good light, slice of life is **Relationship S3/Let's Fall In Love Season 3 (\u6211\u4eec\u604b\u7231\u5427 \u7b2c\u4e09\u5b63)**, Episode 1 from YOUKU Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JprQ5Fd4Qo\n\nRelationship S3/Let's Fall In Love Season 3 official YOUKU playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLATwx1z00Hsdm8ZrlmV232Hd1Z1EfOpr7\n\nAnyway, Relationship S3/Let's Fall In Love Season 3 has that chillax vibe to it. This was unexpectedly so good for me due to the cast/location/etc.\n\nLet's Fall In Love Season 3 is a more mature or really laidback version of these dating shows though as they're in a somewhat rural/etc. area (city of Dali by Erhai Lake in Yunnan, southwest China) and so there's less of that hustle feeling. Some shots of this show really gives you that slice of life bliss.\n\nLike that idyllic, bucolic life, with the picturesque fields, forests, mountains, et cetera.\n\n---\n\n**Check MyDramaList too for a more visual list of these dating shows**. Some people have their lists with only Korean shows, others Chinese, some combined, et cetera.\n\nClick through the thread links for the Google Docs lists too. \n\nAnd like more commentary about the dating shows. Those are often spoiler-free, just describe the synopsis in a different way or mention if the show is more on the funny/unexpected/serious/etc. side.",

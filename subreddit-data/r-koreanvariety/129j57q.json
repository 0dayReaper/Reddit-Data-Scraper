There were so many little and big moments this episode I can't possibly list all of them but the ones I do remember I wanna point out as a way to remind myself why I like this show so much. It's exactly moments like these: \n\n- YSC asking JSM how the cooking is going and helping her with the gas stove. \n- All the oppas teasing her for a good while about the Soju soup \n- Haha and YSC distracting her with her PD to add water \n- JSJ calling backup Haha to tease her \n- \"It would be a disaster if you weren't so cute\"\n- JSJ acting childish with her \n- Teasing her about missing out the sunset \n- even YJS joining on the teasing by blocking her view \n- KJK asking her what her name was \n- playing games when she went to the bathroom despite their promise and stabbing her in the back \n- teaching her how to play Dakji \n- encouraging her while succeeding\n- KJK hugging and shaking her then feeling guilty about suggesting they flip her name back \n- cheering for her loudly \n- YJS standing up for her because she saved their spots for sleep \n- JSJ teaching her how to make dakjis after saying he wouldn't do it (and KJK saying \"you're raising her though\" \ud83d\ude02) \n- YJS making her a Dakji \ud83d\ude2d\n- everyone anxiously waiting and encouraging and cheering her on at the restaurant to flip the Dakji over. That was all they were focusing on. \n\nA roller coaster of emotions, this episode. \n\nSome notes on the episode: \n\n- \"polite SoMin drinks the soup with her back to the rest\" \n\n- Lmao at SoMin saying \"SeChan is from MZ generation\" \ud83d\ude02 you're literally the same age, SO ARE YOU that's why they both placed 1st and 2nd. I wanna scream at YSC&amp; JSM to stop talking about MZ as if they're old farts from a different generation. \ud83d\ude01\n\n- I find the fact that SoMin treats HyungIn like her boss and HyungIn treating her like a little sister (despite her being younger) very cute. \ud83d\ude2d Like, she asked permission from her to go to the bathroom. She asked PD to let her make another Dakji, but HyungIn told her she had to choose only 1. HyungIn laughing when SoMin flipped the Dakji at the end. \n\n- KJK messing up the mussels game and going up to shake hands with the master Messer upper was so funny for some reason. \n\nSeriously, I will watch these people hang out and do nothing and still find it so entertaining. \ud83d\ude01 Yes, the episodes don't have much flow and it's mostly up to the members to come up with stuff to entertain; but when you've got a cast this good - it will be entertaining.\n\nbtw, here is the penalty clip: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ho68yQrNz2w",

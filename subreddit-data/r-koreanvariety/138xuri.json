Need to bring back Yumi and Seojun back together too or not put her in some isolated station where its hard for her to get airtime or anything interesting to happen. still one of my favorites series though",

I'm sad to see this go but hope in the future we can enjoy another season of Jinny's kitchen. or maybe even wooshiks and taetae's food truck lol",

Someone like Wooshik who can lift the energy of people around him. This show would be so dull without Wooshik, he's the moodmaker! Wish we saw him chat more with customers and joking with them like it was on Youn Stay. \n\nPSJ is definitely ready for the boss position haha. There were several times this season when he told Seo Jin what to do when they were in a cinch. Maybe it's bcos he bussed tables in the past working in restaurants before his acting career took off. While LSJ is more focused on the biz and money side, PSJ is a natural when making decisions on the spot. Looking forward to Junny's Kitchen, but still with Yumi!",

            "comment": "Imo this season is not bad, i enjoyed it alot, but i think it's the weakest \"kitchen\" season to date. Probably because in this season they kept showing us the same places again and again. It's either the restaurant or the house. Yes, they played at the lake, but thats it. In the past seasons, they've got more variety, like the members eating at other restaurant or take a walk around the neighborhood. \n\nThis season they really focusing on the customer reaction, but after much \"oh, it's delicious\", it really gets old.\n\nAnd the intern....I mean i get it, they were tired. But, for me who watch the past season, it's really nothing compared to back then. In the first season, there's only 3 of them: Youn an elderly lady, Seo Jin, and Yu Mi. Later came the fourth member Shin Goo, an 80 year old man. The second season Shin Goo got replaced by Seo Joon, and imo Garachico is still the best season. \n\nBut i'm just nitpicking really. Like i said earlier, i enjoyed this show a lot, and can't wait for the next season. Imo the cast gel really well, and their antics at the dinner table was one of my favorite moment.",

Their tenacity and positive attitudes just shine through whatever task they were taking on, and they came accross as being quite humble and hardworking. I really enjoyed the show.",

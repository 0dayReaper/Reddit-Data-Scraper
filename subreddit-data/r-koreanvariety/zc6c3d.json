It's very sweet that they insisted on her being in the photo with them. \n\nKJK's slip and JSJ's welcome back to his snark was so funny.\n\nFootball and WC is huge in SKorea, especially seeing as they were co-host country back in 2002.

At least here they were wearing normal apparel that people usually wear while watching a football match, and none of those student/teacher skit nonsense.\n\nI feel bad for Somin though. It can be easily seen she's not willing to make strong remarks regarding Cho Gue Sung, afraid to get backlash from netizen. It's a shame. Somin shines the most when she lets her inner craziness out.",

Because they're both introverts and actually very reserved. They're literally putting on a show for variety. Which is why they are geniuses and such talented variety stars.",

On Running Man alone we also have YJS KJK and LKS who are introverts; LKS is especially reserved when not on camera. Yet it would be impossible to guess that based on how extroverted they all appear on screen. It's fascinating.",

Being an introvert doesn\u2019t mean you are shy or quiet. \n\nIntroverts can be shy or quiet but they don\u2019t have to be. Introverts spend all of their energy when they interact with people and will get tired and grumpy if they don\u2019t have enough alone time. Extroverts often get sad and depressed when they are alone and will go out of their way to create social interactions. \n\nYou can be an introvert and enjoy being social. You can be an extrovert and enjoy alone time. There is a spectrum and its possible for people to change this attribute overtime.",

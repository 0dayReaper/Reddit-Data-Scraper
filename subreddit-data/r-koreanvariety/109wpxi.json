Just try to imagine Running Man (or any other variety show) adding 12 new faces for a 4 month long singing project while the cast members take a back seat. \n\nI could see Mijoo being affected by this and losing confidence in herself.\n\nIt doesn't help that the concepts on HDYP after(and even before) WSG Wannabe have been all over the place as well. \n\nIt wouldn't be fair to judge Mijoo based on what's happened and I believe that she can come back even stronger in 2023.",

After it aired, articles were written about it and comments didn't take kindly to Mijoo mentioning menstruation (a subject that is regarded as indecent to talk about in SK) to a person who was married. \n\nConsidering how Sixth Sense has always had an element of making YJS uncomfortable (with its 19+ rated jokes and actions), it was surprising how her comment (in comparison to other things said on the show) turned into an issue that brought upon rumors that questioned Mijoo's character to the point where Antenna released an official statement about taking legal action. \n\nChul Min PD himself said that had he known it would become an issue, the production team would have edited that scene out. He also mentioned how there are numerous times in which a footage was funny but is edited out completely for being too inappropriate. \n\nAll this happened just a couple of weeks before the episode on HDYP that aired with Mijoo passing her WSG Wannabe audition which led to even more comments criticising her. \n\nKeep in mind that Mijoo has mentioned before on My Ugly Duckling that when she saw comments that criticised her she would see an ID (that was her mother's name) who replied to the comments saying good things about Mijoo.",

As the youngest in a group, especially among entertainers, Mijoo is the one setting the chopsticks before a meal.  That's a very Korean thing to do, it's not just a schtick.  She may throw in a few jokes about seniority while filming, but that's just what she's used to.",

In LearnWay/How do you play, it seems like those shows are so open ended that she feels more responsible to be an entertainer and is more likely to rely on advice given by the older entertainers she has worked with. Mijoo doesn\u2019t really have a Schtick yet, unless you count the running joke on Sixth Sense that she is always interested in any male guest they have. \n\nOne of the main examples that stand out for me in Kvariety is Ho Dong. Ho Dong is always trying to run the show and teach people how to react or be an entertainer. I think to some degree, Moon Se-Yoon is also like this but thankfully he mostly just teaches people how to eat, his comedy is more natural. The end result is that a lot of korean entertainers aren\u2019t funny because all of their jokes and reactions are the same as every other entertainer in the business.",

There are a lot of good ones, like the entire cast of Earth Arcade, but I find none are good enough that I\u2019d be willing to single one out as my \u201cfavourite\u201d. There\u2019s no female equivalent of YJS, IMO; no female Korean entertainer has the chops to hold my attention or interest for an extended length of time. Invariably, they get on my nerves. So everyone is tied for second place and there is no first.",

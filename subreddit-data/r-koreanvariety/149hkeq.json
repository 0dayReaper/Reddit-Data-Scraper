leg and she pounces on the loose ball that spins in front of her!&lt;\n\nHALFTIME SCORE LINE: &gt;!------- GT 1 - 0 FM------------, FM hasn't scored for quite some time.

1 FM------------, a hard fought game from both teams, the tears start rolling down the eyes of everyone around as SooAh presents her unnie PSY a cake, why does it seem like she's retiring for good with this send off.  SooAh gives a speech remembering her time with her Captain and unnie (*older sister\"), looks like SooAh is also leaving the team due to health reasons and she didn't want to make her leaving a big deal compared to PSY leaving!&lt;\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!AC v WC, battle for the GOLD medal, Korean Women's National Team Coach makes an appearance at the game's start, looks like a goaltending battle, a goal is called off?  Can't wait!!&lt;",

I am a major fan of this show from the beginning, so I am pretty bias. As a soccer player and a fan, the shows is very refreshing.\n\nIts hard to find the first two pilot episodes that were subbed. I watched it unsubbed at dramacool, but you will also need to search for \"Kick a Goal\" or \"Shooting Girls\", or something like that. But for the rest of the episodes, just look for Shooting Stars.",

            "comment": "It was a good game where both teams changed their playing style, on a path of becoming a consistent, contending team. Passing and positioning while looking for opening. Surprisingly quite a balance match between these two teams. \r  \n\r  \nThe sad part was confirmed, with PSY hanging up her soccer cleat. This will definitely affect FC Bullabang progression going forward. PSY was that stable pillar, who guided her team through because of her uncanny ability to understand the game and her field of vision. She will surely be missed. It was great to see her teammates gathered around her and played to their fullest capabilities in this match. \r  \n\r  \nFrom watching these teams from the beginning, I see that a good, reliable and \u201cgangster\u201d mentality captain is important in the team\u2019s growth. Somebody that can rally the team and respected (or scared of) by her teammates. PSY is that person for Bullabang. We can see how Chae Rina pulled FC Top Girl into a complete team, Cho Hae Tae keeps FC Gavenger hungry, Lee Hyun Yi dragged FC Gucheok to be an aggressive team, Lee Young Jin keeps FC Actionista as a contender, and Eva calmed down FC World Class. All these Super League teams have something in common which is the \u201cCaptain\u201d. So far, we can see that Challenge League teams are still lacking in this criterion, which is why their progress is slower, and sometimes inconsistent. The level of commitment that we have seen so far from these two groups is also different when we look at their captains. \r  \n\r  \nPSY will be sorely missed by Bullabang, and I hope they can fill that position quickly with all the current players intact. Or else, SooAh, SoYeon and GaRaeng will be such wasteful talents, never fully actualized by Bullabang.",

The passing/link plays and first touches have always room for improvements, ngl i always wrote off Song Hae Na because Cha Soo Min and Kim Jin Kyung!&lt; outshine her at defense before and somehow she\u2019s contributing on set piece and defense this season. \n\n\nSet pieces is another story for them as Tap-ins or brace will work if placed perfectly. &gt;! Heo Kyung Hee is so suitable on her CM position, great banger from outside box and big plus for Jin Jeong Sun for her try and improving at GK.!&lt; Good season for them.",

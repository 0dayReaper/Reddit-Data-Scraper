    "postText": "So with Love Catcher in Bali having ended about a week ago, what did you guys think of the show overall?\n\nFor me, while I enjoyed the new rules like 'secret night' and the fact that there weren't any eliminations, I can't help but feel like there's some wasted potential with this season \ud83d\ude15 The participants only went on one 1:1 date, and it doesn't happen until we're halfway through the show, making it more difficult for them to form romantic connections.\n\nI also think the editing with the panelists' reactions was a bit much. I was okay with them at first, but towards the end, their commentary scenes seemed quite long... Was that just me? They frequently broke the immersion for me, and I had trouble enjoying some of the couples' scenes.\n\nThough, I still really liked the show! The cast members were fun and had good chemistry. I just wished they were given more opportunities to show their chemistry with more 1:1 dates \ud83d\ude23\n\nWhat about you guys? Did you like this season? Or no...?",

            "comment": "Loved the show thanks to Taeeun and Sooro. Loved both of them as a couple and individuals, great personality, cool, honest, straightforward people with good mindset. \n\nTaeeun relationship with Sooji was really cute and she was a consultant to every male participant. I was quite annoyed at Seungyeon, because it felt like she was going after a guy who was in relationship already, it took me some time to warm up to her. And looking back, the show lasted like a week and it's a dating show so it made sense she tried to get close to someone she liked. Seungyeon and Sooro conversation made me like Sooro even more as well. In general all roommates got along well with each other, it was nice to see. I feel a lot of participants would do way better in longer show. Yujeong, Hyojin, Junghyun were all the types who need time to open up to others. Yongho preferred to take things slower too. \n\nMy main issues are the same with you. Panelists were biased, I would question whether we watched the same thing sometimes, hearing their commentary, they sure tried hard to be funny. Only one 1:1 date was disappointing. They wasted 2days by splitting guys and girls in yoga/surfing and later gift buying episode. It was a shame considering how little time was there. And finally editing, it was questionable entire time but I got especially annoyed at Sooro-Taeeun edit on ep 7. Stuff got cut and patched up to made it seem as if they had some issues when that wasn't the case at all.\n\nWith all this being said I really liked the show and would definitely recommend to watch it.",

I do wish they brought back the round robin style from S1/S2 where everyone gets a date with everyone of the other sex, and that 5/5 split was absolute BS, but otherwise I really enjoyed this season.",

And yes, there should have been more one-on-one dates to form different connections or everyone would just go for the same person. The panelist insights were so inaccurate that their session was a total waste of time. However I think the cast was great and the season overall was interesting. It definitely saved the show from last year's disaster.",

I want more 'money/love' reveals to the participants and allowing them to switch coins at the end needs a different spin.\n\nSR carried the show and TE's commentary was good. She definitely 'acted scared' for the viewers. \n\nI think the 2nd couple were only good for a week-long 'fling' and the worst successful pairing so far in LC history!",

YJ crying a river over JH\u2019s identity only to end up changing to money and playing TH at the end is so \ud83d\udc80 only worth watching for SR and TE, and i skipped SJ &amp; SB scenes cause they\u2019re both cringe as hell. i like the concept of secret night though, but they could\u2019ve done more with it. meh season, but better than the last one.",

Some interesting thoughts:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060The girls that are initially chose to be MC are actually down to earth, have more attractive personalities. TE is my favourite but HJ is also have all the desirable gf characteristics (intelligent, reasonable, value communication and pretty of course).\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Maybe because I\u2019m a girl, I didn\u2019t find SJ or YJ have any charm other their looks. SY is cool but too bad she had fallen too deep for SR and became miserable, didn\u2019t bother to show off her charms to anyone else. Well, can\u2019t blame her, SR is definitely a gem.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060The relationship that works out was the one between LC and MC (who switched at the end). TE-SR and Sera-JJ (season 2) proved that. And that are the girls who switched. Their connection and feelings must be deep and big enough to make such decisions. That\u2019s why those relationships last. The relationship between LC-LC couldn\u2019t worked out because it was only a crush, for such short amount of time and it\u2019s understandable.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060I shipped YH and HJ at the beginning because they have so many things in common, love for books, English, study abroad, introverts etc. They will never running out of topics when they are on a date. SJ is just a pretty girl, I even think she is not that pretty comparing to the other 4 girls, but that how Korean men like I guess. Toward the end, YH is such a loser, I actually feel that HJ deserves someone better than him so I stop shipping :)\n\n\u2022\tDefinitely need more 1:1 dates, I think the limitation here is that it is in Bali, the production had limited resources, they don\u2019t have that much places for couples activities. Plus only some of the casts can speak English so all of the workshops that require interaction with locals are difficult to do.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060I don\u2019t really like the panel either, they are bias and not so nice, only Gabi is likeable for me, she was not judging towards TE and SR.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060TE-SR chemistry is over the roof, especially in their 2D1N trip at the end, I think they would have kissed a few times if there was no camera around \ud83d\ude02. Love it!!! Because they are both cool and not pretentious. \ud83e\udd70\n\n\u2022\tAnd TH, poor my man, he is a gentleman throughout the last trip even though he knew YJ would switch to money as soon as they read the envelope. YJ made a bad choice at the end for picking him over HJun, none of them is actually enjoying the trip and only felt uncomfortable, regretting and heartbroken at the end.",

Don't forget to convert it to your time zone.\n\nThis is similar to Netflix, Disney+, etc. when it comes to other (dating) shows. Like Single's Inferno (\uc194\ub85c\uc9c0\uc625), Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774), et cetera all released around that 3:00AM EST time or early morning.\n\nSome more info if you want to watch early with the machine translated English subtitles: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zyutpg/love_catcher_in_bali_e06_221230/j29fe39/\n\n---\n\n**Check here for where to watch other dating shows (and East Asian variety shows, Kdramas/Jdoramas/Cdramas/et cetera) with VPN/et cetera, you'll need it for VIU, Disney+, and so on**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zobw4m/where_can_i_watch_variety_shows_here_in_spain/j0m09qv/\n\n---\n\nIf you're not averse to going around accessibility problems or region-locks, \nthen definitely check out **ArmsAsuncion's website for redditors, it has East Asian variety shows, Kdramas/Jdoramas/Cdramas/et cetera.**\n\nThat website has **access to Viki, VIU, OnDemandKorea (this usually has no English subs though), iQIYI, and now WeTV/Tencent Video content**. So **no Netflix or Disney+ or not really the newer Korean OTT services/platforms** (as they don't usually have English subs) like wavve, Coupang Play, etc.\n\n**Tteokbeokki/noonaspoiler** usually has pretty quick VIU/etc. content, plus they also do some machine translated English subs for dating shows that haven't been officially subbed or fansubbed.\n\nFor distracting pop ups (and also there's additional filters/etc. for workarounds with anti-adblocks), just use **/r/uBlockOrigin** since that's what everyone uses for the safe (as far as most people know), legit, etc. adblocker. The other ones are often not open-sourced, proven to be sketchy, et cetera.\n\nAnd many more usual streaming sites for those that are not reluctant. Like you can type \"DatingShowName + English sub + site:reddit.com\" to make sure you're on the right track of where to find the show if it's not in the usual places.\n\nUsually some people will quickly post the info on where to watch these dating shows, though ya sometimes mods will remove it. Ask in /r/koreanvariety as that's where a lot of us dating show fans congregate and the mods there are more relaxed about stuff.\n\nOr if you **check MyDramaList for more visual info on these dating shows**, some of the commenters there will also post the people's Instagram/Weibo/social media/etc. as well as the Bilibili and other streaming platforms links.\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and more info on where to watch them**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/1076jds/good_dating_shows/j3kxjmx/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zyn2y0/regarding_the_popularity_of_the_different_dating/j2a8bok/\n\n**Upcoming East Asian dating shows for 2023 and also some that finished recently without proper English subs**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10h8j84/upcoming_dating_shows_likely_to_be_subbed/j58yx1m/  \n\n**Compiled list of other East Asian dating shows (this is initially sorta \"scandalous\" dating shows, click through the thread links for more other info)**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/y83ke7/pink_lie_episode_4_discussion_spoilers/j584452/",

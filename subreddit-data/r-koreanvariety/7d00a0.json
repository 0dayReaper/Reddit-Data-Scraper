The chef known not just for his amazing food but also his colorful words on TV will be on Korean TV. He'll be on JTBC's 'Please Take Care of My Refrigerator' as one of the chefs for Oh Seung Hwan and Hong Sung Eun's episode. He'll be competing with the other chefs to cook a 15-minute meal for the guests.\n\nThis will be the chef's first ever Korean variety show appearance, with recording taking place this November 18.\n\nMake sure to tune in when it airs!\n\nSource: https://www.allkpop.com/article/2017/11/michelin-starred-chef-gordon-ramsay-will-be-on-please-take-care-of-my-refrigerator\n\n**Gordon Ramsay To Compete On \u201cPlease Take Care Of My Refrigerator\u201d**\n\nGordon Ramsay will be appearing on a Korean variety program for the very first time!\n\nOn November 15, JTBC confirmed earlier reports that the well-renowned celebrity chef will be taking part in the upcoming November 18 recording of \u201cPlease Take Care of My Refrigerator\u201d as a special guest chef. He will participate in the show\u2019s normal 15-minute challenge, where two chefs go head-to-head to make a meal based on the ingredients available from a celebrity\u2019s fridge, rather than just make a special appearance.\n\nGordon Ramsay is a chef and restaurateur who has been awarded 16 Michelin stars in total. He is also known for his numerous television programs, which include \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen,\u201d \u201cMaster Chef,\u201d \u201cThe F Word,\u201d and \u201cKitchen Nightmares.\u201d He was recently named as a brand spokesperson for Korean beer brand Cass, and will be in South Korea on November 17-20.\n\nThe producing director (PD) of \u201cPlease Take Care of My Refrigerator\u201d Lee Chang Woo commented, \u201cFor the most skilled people in a specific industry to compete and cook for 15 minutes is a difficult thing, but Chef Gordon Ramsay readily agreed to appear as he was very interested in the format of [our show].\u201d\n\nThe PD revealed that the \u201cPlease Take Care of My Refrigerator\u201d episode featuring Gordon Ramsay will air sometime in the beginning of December as one of the show\u2019s third anniversary specials that will begin with the show\u2019s November 20 broadcast. Baseball players Oh Seung Hwan and Hong Sung Heon will be the two guests to have their fridges featured.\n\nSource: https://www.soompi.com/2017/11/14/gordon-ramsay-compete-please-take-care-refrigerator/\n\nAre you excited this?!?! I'm soo can't wait! ",

And also his famous rages have always been directed at people who believe they're better than they actually are, or who are supposed to be executive/head chefs and not acting or performing like it.\n\nI think he even said one time there's a clear difference between him doing master chef and him doing hell's kitchen.  One (master chef) is for people who are kind of amateur chefs or somewhat professional and are in a competition between themselves.  The other is people competing for a job at a new restaurant, and so he will tolerate nothing but the best.  And you can see there's a clear difference between him in both shows.",

Can't wait for this episode, honestly, if he cooks, everyone is gonna need to go into coma before eating again because his food is just too good that you can't eat something else afterward",

In fact, *Please Take Care of My Refrigerator* is the only one I watch nowadays mainly because I was sick of the adversarial quality and sensationalism in cooking shows in the US, so I don't really know much about Ramsay's TV presence beyond the commercials and YouTube videos I've come across.\n\nThat makes me sad knowing the US market had that effect on him.",

Like I said in a response above, the reason I stopped watching US cooking shows is because of the sensationalism and the adversarial quality to them (in the sense that the end of each episode results in a contestant feeling crappy for getting cut). *Please Take Care of My Refrigerator* gives a better sense of friendly competition.",

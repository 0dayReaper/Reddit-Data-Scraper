The six members with different charms become friends faster  than anyone else. They create tension, showing off their visuals, talents, and charms as they over indulge in games. Look forward to the   bustling livelihood of the six girls who have been reborn as true  sisters to settle comfortably in their dream house of nothing!\n\n**Cast:**\n\n* Hye Ri\n* Miyeon\n* Lee Jung\n* Ye Na\n* Chae Won\n* Patricia\n\n**RAW:**\n\n|1080p.NF-Sniper|magnet:?xt=urn:btih:1402891af07f76eb2aa767c5b73b2f52675ee659|\n|:-|:-|\n|1080p.WANNA|magnet:?xt=urn:btih:633ee4a0bb839d07abb13cb13b8148a43e32f50a|\n|720p|magnet:?xt=urn:btih:a54a8bf7fec457880a687ef8ec690bfa7af4843b|\n\n**Subtitle:**\n\n|Subscene|[https://subscene.com/subtitles/hyemileeyechaepa](https://subscene.com/subtitles/hyemileeyechaepa)|\n|:-|:-|\n|||\n\n**Subbed/Streaming:**\n\n[Streaming - Viki](https://www.viki.com/tv/39624c-hyemileeyechaepa)\n\n[Streaming - Kocowa](https://www.kocowa.com/en_us/season/73810764/hyemileeyechaepa)\n\n[Shows of the Week Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/wiki/shows_of_the_week_2023/week_20/#wiki_sunday_.2823.05.21.29)",

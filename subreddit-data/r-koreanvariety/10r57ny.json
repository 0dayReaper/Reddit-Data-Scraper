goalkeeper this game, This game will be played on a newly designed field for ShootingStars, looks to be a bigger field, **SungJae and SooGeun** get a better view of the action from above, **Seo MoonTak** is not at the game, no substitute player for BD!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~1' BD Miss: **NF SooYeon** passes to **NF EunJi** who has a bad first touch and sends the ball in the air in front of her with a pressuring **BD KyungSeo** who gets to the ball and takes a shot on goal to miss on the wide right side by inches, **SooYeon** was in net as back up but as a field player, good idea to make the net look smaller!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' BD Miss: **BD KyungSeo** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot on net towards **BD SeoGi** who heads the ball but doesn't get good contact **NF EunJi** is there to cut the angle off and smother the small rebound she gave up!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' BD Miss: **BD SeoGi** gets a loose ball and passes to **BD KyungSeo** who passes it right back to

to **NF SooYeon** who one-time power shoots it on target from the centerline aimed for the top left corner, **MinSeo** blocks the ball and the rebound goes out of bounds for a corner kick, yes this is

centerline to the NF net and only **NF EunJi** in her way, **BD SeoGi** dribbles all the way to the top of the 16 yard box and takes a shot on target, but **NF EunJi** is there to make the save but

off of NF defenders to **BD SeoGi** who slows down the play and back passes to **BD KyungSeo**, **BD KyungSeo** attracts **NF Mira** and **NF SeoHyun** before passing it back to **BD SeoGi** and then **BD KyungSeo** cuts to the wide open opposite wing side and **BD SeoGi** completes the give-and-go play and passes to a wide open **BD KyungSeo** who takes a weak one-time shot on net with her left foot, but **NF EunJi** smothers the low kicked ball, **BD Lisa** was there if a rebound was created!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' NF Miss: **NF MiRa** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot on net which is deflected by **BD SeoGi** who was the defensive wall, the deflected ball rolls to a wide open **NF SooYeon** who takes a left footed shot on target but is denied by a well-positioned **BD MinSeo** who instantly smothers the ball in her arms!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!10' BD GOAL: **BD KyungSeo** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot on net which is deflected by **NF MiRa** who was the defensive

of all players in front of the net (i don't think there were any deflections so if it went in it would not count as a goal) **BD MinSeo** tracks the ball and blocks it leaving a huge juicy rebound in front of the goal mouth, **NF SeoHyun** jumped too fast at the ball and missed a second chance ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' NF Miss: **NF MiRa** takes a sideline kick-in with a rolling pass to an

net!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' BD Miss: **BD SeungYeon** passes to **BD SeoGi** who passes to **BD KyungSeo** on the right wing side, she stops the ball and passes it right back to **BD SeoGi** who takes a shot on target which **NF EunJi** blocks with her body and there is a juicy rebound in front of the net, **BD KyungSeo** gets to the ball but doesn't get any good shots on goal, **NF EunJi**

SooYeon**, **BD SeoGi** takes a power shot on target but **NF EunJi** blocks the ball with a rebound in front of her and attacks the rebound and smothers it before **BD Lisa** can get a shot off, **NF

area, and lobs a pass to **BD SeoGi**, she traps the ball and with **NF EunJi** on her back, turns around and takes a shot on net and scores, **NF EunJi** played too tight on **BD SeoGi**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' BD Miss: **BD SeungYeon** crosses a pass to the opposite wing where **BD SeoGi** receives and passes to a **BD KyungSeo** who is running down the same wing, **BD KyungSeo** takes a quick shot on goal which **NF EunJi** smothers!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' NF Miss: **NF MinJeong** takes a sideline kick-in and quickly passes to **NF MiRa** to an unprepared BD team, **BD SeungYeon** sprints back and kicks the ball for a corner kick before **NF MiRa** can take a shot on net!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' NF Miss: **NF SooYeon** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot towards the goal mouth, which **NF SeoHyun** gets a touch but **BD Lisa** blocks and **BD MinSeo** attacks to smother the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' NF Miss: **NF HeeJeong** intercepts a pass and runs into **BD SeungYeon** who misplays the ball, **NF HeeJeong** has the ball and the whole left wing side to hersel, she manages to take a shot on goal and just misses the short right side by inches, great effort but lacks the finishing touch, the whistle blows to call the game's end!&lt;\n\n\nFINAL SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- NatFam 1 - **4  BallaDream**, great effort by NatFam with chances of their own but BallaDream's powerful offense, great passing shines through, time to restructure for both teams with players leaving to pursue their dreams off the field ----------------!&lt;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!BallaDream v Gaevengers, looks like both teams will field full lineups, MinSeo will be goalie, looks like **AN Noh YoonJu** will be watching this game in the stands!&lt;",

            "comment": "Something that hasn't been said.\n\nYang EunJi did great as goalkeeper for NatFam.  Although the score line looks bad in general, she did a great job blocking shots, tracking down shots, and being alert all around.  The hugely offensively skilled BallaDream kinda made her look bad, but when NatFam is just draining their energy trying to follow pass after pass it's hard to blame the goalie for the loss.\n\nI remember when EunJi was a horrible inattentive goalie.  Now her improvements will be missed when NatFam restructures and has to find a new goalie.\n\nMiRa's leadership will be missed as well, so finding a new leader and a goalie will be the PDs task.  I am trusting they have great replacements coming on board.",

But then the end of the 3 years are near and you get boys who got scouted by a top highschool team in another prefecture or foreign football club far away and needs to leave the team. &gt;!Or in the case of SooYeon, it's more like she has to unwillingly retire to help out at her (parents bustling ramen) shop. :D !&lt;\n\nSo they have one final game in the manga left to play their hearts out and leave no regrets behind. That's what BallaDreams intro this episode felt to me and I cried my Shounen tears with them due to all the girls and the coach being such a closeknit family-style team.  \n\nI just wish MiRa played for Actionistas and we got to see her amazing volleyshot technique and off the ball runs rewarded alot more. But it is what it is, as she would say...",

            "comment": "&gt;!While it wasn't a particularly close match at the end, this was a really fun game as I was rooting for Balladream to win. Their passing, which is often accurate, makes the game so much more fun to watch. Watching the coaches flip out and cheer for them, with the one coach having fallen for Seogi, is a lot of fun. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Minseo really stepped up from her previous outings as a goalie. Bravo to her. I can't say I want her as the GK full time but if she has to be, I think she is playing really well and has the potential to be one of the best. Her natural athleticism, size, taking to the position quickly and her field play which makes her reliable to pass back to, all makes her a GK with a bright future if needed. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!It's good that the new stadium seemed to be nice. I wonder if that will be the new full time location or when possible (weather) they will stick to the outdoors location? !&lt;\n\n&gt;!It's sad players are leaving but it's to be expected. Having to get back to their main careers (tennis instructor, mother, singing). I fear for the show's quality if this is just a preview of all of the players that will be leaving between this season and the next. A lot of teams are doing well with their organic development and when a player or two leaves each team it can ruin that. The players are at the point now where you can't sign up newbies to soccer to join the teams because they will be dead weight for at least a full season. But how do you find singers/actors/hosts-presenters/models/comedians/idols/etc that have enough soccer experience to fit in with the teams current playing skill but not so much that they are the next Lee Jung-eun? So far they've done a solid job with athletes like Kang Soyeon and Kyung Hee but if there is a mass exodus of players this off-season... I fear for the quality of play league wide. !&lt;",

Injuries and other main responsibilities for these players are a legit reason for them to leave. We would love for them to commit to these because we can see how much they grow physically and mentally, no to mention their skills too. There are too many examples of that with the old players. Another one is finding new celeb talents to fill those spots. Is the pool wide enough to look for replacements considering each team has their own concept. After some time, it looks like some of these players could be easy fit in multiple genre. FC Gukdae will always have a problem with this after each season.",

Since either Kyungseo/Seogi can cover the mid and the fullbacks were left to Son Seung Yoon and Minseo the *defense were intact and not overextended* most of the time while building up for goals. !&lt; I want to gave them props (all members) too because of great ball recovery.\n\n\nFor &gt;!NatFam it\u2019s really obvious that they\u2019re on power vacuum because their main piece Lee Jung Eun left. !&lt;Even tho all of them is playing good but the opposition is too good to them, even a cautious defending+good GK\u2019ing isn\u2019t enough because you had 2 opponent forwards who has a everything to worn off/ pierced through the defense from flurries and good finishing. However there\u2019s some instances for team of **missed chances** in either set pieces, broken plays from pressing/ transition and long balls; that they might considering of improving at least their first touches then to finishing so it will generate more favourable outcomes to them.\n\n\n&gt;!Kim Soo Yeon!&lt; was great on that match, not bad for a defender who can strike from distance (like Yubin of Top Girl) that made her threatening in set piece/ midfield despite on her frame and age. &gt;!Hwang Hee Jung!&lt; shown immense improvement from last matches, she was intended for defense but you can see that she can be a mid/forward due to her decent dribbling; plus her speed is the great factor on why she should be watch out on future because *if Heo Kyung Hee (Giants) can, why not her?* \n\n\nPlayers of the Game : &gt;!Kyungseo and Seogi!&lt;, pass play was a eye candy, bonus is &gt;!Kyungseo!&lt; can hustle up on scrimmages for rebounds and ball recovery (hence their first goal). 2 were great on link plays together with &gt;!Son Seung Yeon/ Risa.!&lt; And for &gt;!Seogi!&lt; they\u2019re right on her for comparing in Messi; dribbling + she was a ***excellent False 9*** on that match, great mid facilitator when she was at **defense position** on early 1st half until coach &gt;! Kim Tae Young switch her up to **midfield** so Kyungseo and Risa can flank up on 2 sides and gave her freedom to link up to them and also has position with Son Seung Yeon will crutch up the fullbacks (sometimes with Kyungseo)!&lt; so thru her they literally &gt;!shattered NatFam midfield into pieces.!&lt;",

There is potential with more training, however with the current shift in their players, we will never know until next season. But HeeJung and MinJung did showed some progress and it looked like they are serious in upgrading their skills. GK position will be a challenge for Gukdae since at this level, all the other team current GKs are fully skilled. Another re-haul, and looks like another lost season.\n\nBalladream was able to move the ball freely because of a weaker opponent. Against a stronger faster team, they will have some problems. They are a fast team, but Seogi will need to pick up a bit of speed to play the combination build-up with KyeongSeo for text season. Too bad they will need a new strong defender for the new season, which I think is necessary to stay competitive. Training someone new will take time and effort if she come in with no prior football experience. The good thing from this match is we know that Lisa can handle herself when playing in-field position. So Balladream have two reliable GK if something bad happens.",

The thing she lacks off are speed and power but she will be there to score a goal. Also not sure if she will stay for next season, or going back to Japan, but her husband could be a prospect for a new coach. MinJeong can improve her skills or that speed is just a waste. She did played kind of weak (physically) which was understandable since her team is overall weak. They might even be a cannon fodder for Challenge League with the new lineup. \n\nAgreed with not a game you watched multiple times. Since it was expected for Balladream to take over the game.\n\nExcited for the next game of Ballad Vs Gavengers. Let's see if Ballad can pull off this tiki taka style against a faster and aggressive Gavengers. Fitness wise; Gav win. Overall skills; Gav win. GK rating; Gav win. Hoping that they can pull this off.",

Which also means Lee Young Pyo is willing to sacrifice being entertaining as long as they can prevent the opponent playing well.\n\nand based on [Ha Seok Ju's witty comments](https://imgur.com/gallery/tIKpzpE), i believe Kyeongseo-SEOGI did well in that game",

Balladream have many times overcome hurdle after hurdle, in the challenger league , seolgi injured in the second game,  comeback vs anaconda in third game, playing with injured main CB in the play off match and last minute  goal comeback. very tight match in the first super league game, and really unlucky against worldclass.\n\nwhile GAV have so many time disappointed me again and again. with GAV usually when thing going wrong, their start to crumble. \n\nhowever, it is one off match, in which anything can happen.\n\nBalladream and Gav are two of my favorites team, so i wish this match would have not happened. it is better if WW or Anaconda get second place in the CL and goes to play against Balladream lol.",

Kyungseo would be first, and son yeoung would be second.\n\nhopefully,  moon tak would improve a lot more next season and/or a new athletic player would come in that could contribute in defence.\n\noh one more thing. damn lisa really impress me in this match. she lack in pshyical and speed department, but her first touch , really really wow. she  have a talent in positioning too. a newbie that only played for few months and first time playing as onfield player but she is playing like that. i dont know who the next season coach is. but if i am the next coach, i would nuture her as number 9/ attacking midfield. with more experience and improve fitness/physical she could become an important player.\n\nas for GK, just let minseo play there permanently. she have shown a great and stellar performance as GK in this game. morever, the ball playing ability as GK that she showed in these game is really outstanding. there is one time seolgi make a strong and fast backpass, minseo did not panic, calmly control it, and build up the play.",

She also stops playing when a mistake is made.  She needs to continue the play and be ready for second chance opportunities.  But when you  stop playing to hold your head in shame that does a disservice to the players still on the field that continue until the whistle blows.\n\nMinKyung needs to start taking shots like how MiRa shot on net and start some craziness in front of the goal mouth and hope that her teammates can kick in a garbage goal.\n\nHyeSun clips from the previews is making me interested in the game.  We will see a new form of defense.  Rather than marking the player, it looks like Coach Lee YongPyo told them about interceptions in the passing lane.  Some of BallaDream passes are telegraphed.  So instead of running to the player, just cut off the pass to the player",

My money is on Nat Fam getting demoted.\n\nOh no machamp is leaving \ud83d\ude22 awwww mira and eonji-ah too\n\nSeo Hyun's husband was so sweet in the car \ud83d\ude2d\n\nOooooh a stadiummmmm\n\nOh nooooo no sub for ballad??? \n\nOmg lisa is playing on the field w a broken hand and they have no sub \ud83d\ude31\n\nMaybe it's not looking so good for balladream...\n\nKim soo yeon is killlllinggggg defense this game. She really is the second GK for nat fam. \n\nKS w the multigoals!!! \n\nMinseo is doing great at GK too\n\nBallad might have a tougher time in the 2nd half since none of them got to rest \n\nHonestly nat fam getting demoted would follow the champs' curse, FM also got demoted then fought their way back up to the challenge league (w a whole new much younger team lol)\n\nThis game is like a finals match lol so scary \n\nI'll miss machamp, she really is reliable in defence. And is one of the only team members w a sturdy physique.\n\nLmao coach baek's \"crush\" on seogi is so funny. Such a fanboy.\n\nI really hope seogi and KS stay on the show for a while bc it's so fun to watch them play together! Lisa is not doing too bad for her first field game in a long time, but also looking fwd to MS getting to play on the field. She makes a solid GK tho. \n\nMan at this rate Ballad is gonna sweep Gav away too... it will be hard to pick a team to cheer for in the next match up. \n\nShit if that was mira's last game... they'll have to bring in someone super solid/athletic to save the team. EJ also improved a lot. Will they bring back LJE? \n\nOmg next game looks so fun!!! I love gav and ballad... i guess it's a win/lose for me either way lol \ud83e\udd72 at least they are both staying on next season no matter what, in one league or another. But I kinda wanna see ballad make it onto the super league podium next season.",

            "comment": "This game was super boring to me after the great plays in the final the week before. I knew who was going to win immediately. \n\n&gt;! Balladdream always good with their tikitaka. The only danger they had was being one person short and having another person having to cover for goal because their goalie broke her hand so they were going to be exhausted.!&lt;\n\n&gt;! NatFam was super disappointing to me, how could you go from champs to relegation. That\u2019s embarrassing. It\u2019s not the lack of super plays or skills for me; just the lack of soccer IQ and knowing the rules. People don\u2019t disappear after they pass the ball but they would always stop defending once the ball was passed and off ball movements were not protected.  They had a lot of wasted movement. I felt bad for Yang Eunji. That\u2019s just poor defending for a team in the Super league.!&lt;\n\nReady for this season to be over and see new players and new teams. I hope the next game is more competitive.",

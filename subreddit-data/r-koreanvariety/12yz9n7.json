They have to work up to the day before the air date to finish it and sometimes. we have seen in the past shows air unedited clips or corrupted ones because of the load on the staff and limited resources in the networks",

Presently, shows that are produced for international streaming service such as Netflix and Disney+, the TV Series are wholly preproduced before release. And a lot shows locally currently are preproduced for a variety of reasons, such as labour laws, QA and essentially better scheduling on both the part of Production and also Manpower.",

I have seen articles stating some projects filmed 20 hours in one day",

Examples are Amazing Saturday and usually commentary based/reaction panel types. More \u201creal\u201d variety shows usually film every week that lasts one episode, sometimes two. Assuming you\u2019re talking about variety shows of course, dramas would differ greatly.",

Like many Korean shows, they tape and air all year round, with maybe a few additional breaks for preemptions (like major sports events) and holidays.",

I don\u2019t really keep up with the timing anymore but I can still see they do the commentary part in the same week as broadcast (e.g: I Live Alone broadcast is on Friday and they do the commentary on Monday. but I think they\u2019re quite flexible and might be filming earlier or later for some segments, I know they sometimes do the commentary on Tuesdays)",

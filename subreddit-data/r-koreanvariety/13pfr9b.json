To be honest, it's natural for someone to sacrifice and someone to benefit from team play.\n\nXitsuh: While playing the game, I felt a bit disappointed with the Jungle team. I\u2019m here to play a survival game, I\u2019m not here to protect them.\n\nDex to Yunbi: the atmosphere is a little weird.\n\nYunbi: He's not a sacrificial team player. It's a team play disguised as an individual play.\n\nYunbi interview: I intend to ignite the embers of the conflict between XS and Dex.\n\nHyunji: I want to make XS and Jinho drop out today\n\nJinho: I got so mad watching them. Today, Dex and HJ... were upsetting. I\u2019m just going to work hard. Ah, it\u2019s really hard today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey literally captioned Yunbi with: the **devil\u2019s whisper** that incites division LOL. I know it was bound to happen but I wasn't expecting it to happen this soon. I was looking forward to more team plays and I was hoping for a similar outcome like in Time Hotel where the alliance went until the finals but I guess there's nothing that can be done if the game is an individual one.",

I remember people being pretty accurate with those.\n\nAnyways, everyone is wearing different outfits between the first and second part of the preview. I didn't see Pi in the second part of it, though. Hopefully she's eliminated... I feel like she has the potential to get far with the \"anyone but me\" strategy.",

Everyone else can be seen in at least 2 more outfits that we haven't seen yet!&lt;. Unless someone can correct me. However, it is important to note that the first spoiler would &gt;!make analysing outfits not very helpful, since hypothetically someone could get eliminated then come back again another/the next day in a new thing. So that might throw a lot of deductions out the window!&lt;.",

            "comment": "My (could be totally offff) prediciton based on the previews and their personality/gameplay:\n\nIn ep 9 \n\nChulgu probably started making decisions for his own benefit in the main match instead of taking a risky move for the team (In the video Dex argued to Chulgu that it's natural to take risk/sacrifice in teamplays while Chulgu think it's natural to break apart now since it's an individual survival match now not the wild)\nHong Jinho seems to be neutral. But then leaned more towards Chulgu since he understands the nature of such shows and is perplexed as to why Dex is mad over such a thing.\n\nThis started the split probably.\n\nIn ep 10 \n\nHyunji starts planning to play individually too and sets out the day targeting Chulgu and Jinho, well she's got enough reasons to do so. I think Hyunji's motive is more broad including them being a threat in general. Dex's reason for following along is probably somewhere along the line of LOYALTY BETRAYYY WHY. \nJinho is probably disappointed/sad that Dex and Hyunji is targeting him (&amp;Chulgu) since he doesn't consider what Chulgu (w his support) has done to be betrayal. \n\n\n\nI could be totally off and they just straight up betrayed each other like savages but oh well.\n\nMy thoughts: I'm just hoping Kong survive another week lol. Half of the time he also seems to be just confused by the 'kids' antics and it's funny haha.",

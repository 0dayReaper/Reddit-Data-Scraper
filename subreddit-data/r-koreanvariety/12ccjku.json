            "comment": "You've watched basically most of the latest ones, lol.\n\nA missing recent one is **Love Alarm: Clap! Clap! Clap! (\uc88b\uc544\ud558\uba74 \uc6b8\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9dd!\uc9dd!\uc9dd!)**, apparently the English/etc. subs are on Dailymotion.\n\nDon't forget **I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO (/r/IamSolo)**, more info on I Am Solo: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/12bduuc/new_offbrand_terrace_house_set_to_start_this_may/jewxvfh/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10en6s3/couples_who_are_still_together_after_dating_show/j4sgvhq/\n\nFor a show with secrets like Pink Lie (and the Japanese show called REA(L)OVE) and so on, **Secret Man and Woman (\ube44\ubc00\ub0a8\ub140)** was fansubbed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/wutb91/dating_shows_currently_airing/ilet8iz/?context=3\n\n---\n\nThere was also Creator Campus with April/UNI.T Lee Hyunjoo, Minseo/\ubbfc\uc11c, etc. It was more like a promotion show though, lol, for the beauty products. Still worth a watch. Other more youth shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/109jq5z/the_dating_reality_show_romance_before_debut/j3yyfii/\n\n**Creator Campus (\ud06c\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc774\ud130 \ucea0\ud37c\uc2a4)**, full series (3 hours) from \ub9c8\uc774\ubdf0\ud2f0\uc528 MyBeautyC Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDNQ8_6vzk\n\nThere's an upcoming youth show on Netflix for possibly Q3 of 2023, it's called **Nineteen to Twenty (\uc5f4\uc544\ud649\uc2a4\ubb3c) or 19/20**, check these threads for more info: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/102skks/nineteen_to_twenty_1920_a_new_netflix_youth/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/102r1di/nineteen_to_twenty_korean_version_of/\n\n---\n\nTwinkle Love is the best youth/etc. show, it's like a way chill version of Ainori: Love Wagon, but for Chinese university students. Sometimes the Twinkle Love panelists (and everyone) have really hilarious reactions/situations too, lmao.\n\nThe YOUKU dating shows like Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81) often have bonus content, like versions of the episodes without the panelists, actual unreleased scenes, livestreams with the housemates watching the episodes together, et cetera.\n\n**Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81)**, Season 1 Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxP-Ye9kr24\n\n**Twinkle Love Season 2 (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81 \u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b63)** Episode 1 Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78vUkTAhuG8\n\n**More info on Twinkle Love and other traveling/culture/et cetera shows**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10pyock/im_just_sad_terrace_house_is_gone_i_miss_them_all/j6rhk67/\n\n---\n\nCheck the ABEMA channel (ABEMA \u604b\u611b\u3010\u516c\u5f0f\u3011, https://www.youtube.com/@Love_ABEMA/videos), it has a bunch of new shows like Shuffle Island Season 3 that look like Single's Inferno and so on but nobody is subbing it. \n\nWith ABEMA shows (Japanese streaming service) don't expect English subs, more info at the bottom of the comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10pyock/im_just_sad_terrace_house_is_gone_i_miss_them_all/j6st18w/\n\nThe newest ABEMA one is about (Korean/Japanese) idols that will date before debuting, lol.\n\nIt's called **Romance Before Debut (\u30ed\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306f\u3001\u30c7\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u524d\u306b\u3002)**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKVyebCB3ug. Oh they privated/changed the link, here's Episode 1 of Romance Before Debut: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4y6W1Hd5WU\n\n---\n\nFor Chinese dating shows there's the 4th season of Yes, I Do that just got released a week or so ago. They got a really nice house/et cetera for this fourth season of Yes, I Do. Some new vibes too.\n\n**Yes, I Do (\u559c\u6b22\u4f60\u6211\u4e5f\u662f4), from iQIYI channel, Episode 1, Part 1 and 2**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqkOGp2dQqw and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEV0hZTWj9c\n\n---\n\nThere's this variety show called **Love Me Actually** (2019, with Kim Minkyu, Heo Kyunghwan, Yang Sechan, etc.), it had comedians for the male participants and then like minor celebrities/influencers/etc. or regular people for the female participants.\n\nLove Me Actually was so fun, some of us wish there's a season 2 or like say a spiritual successor. It's a traveling club or more like a variety/game show and so on but some situations were so hilarious, rofl.\n\nCheck iheartu2's Twitter, this past day they were recently posting about the unknown Korean dating shows.\n\n---\n\nAnyway, there's also the other dating shows made for Youtube now.\n\nThere's this new one on Youtube that just like finished, it's called **Love Teenager (from \ud558\uc774\ud2f4\uc5d0\uc774\uc800 Hi-teenager), Episode 1 and playlist**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeQ1Io7A2gs&amp;list=PL5mea1ZCJQuTrO7YvXZ9gfPRHlaK-xc8E\n\nJust some warning, Love Teenager might be triggering for those that had toxic/etc. people around them.\n\nFor dating shows on Youtube that have Koreans and international people, there's also **Ramyun &amp; Chill (from DKDKTV channel), Episode 1 and playlist**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-QbAbV_8NI&amp;list=PLq0bxUK0D1KZp83qLQRKGvlVPIsUOdxjR)\n\nAnd also **3&amp;More (from Blimey \ube14\ub77c\uc774\ubbf8 channel), Season 4, Episode 1 and playlist**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8M1LEZ485w&amp;list=PLyfSAn8BP3bA2daCAa9G2TzeLSsDbtYRo), etc.\n\n---\n\n**Play Safe Play Me** was unexpected so good, definitely try it. They're on an island and it's pretty peaceful. Just ignore the gambling sponsor advertisements and elements, lol.\n\nThese are Malaysian-Chinese/Singaporean/etc. dating shows, Play Safe Play Me, One Week Love, and Dui Ni You Gan Jue, check here: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yyjiu2/love_catcher_in_bali_e01_221118/iwvbxrm/\n\nPlay Safe Play Me (from the Leeroy Wong channel), it was marketed/titled as a Malaysian version of Single's Inferno but it's actually really different and somewhat chill. Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt665qFsW3s\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and Kdramas, East Asian films, et cetera, and more info on where to watch them**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10yej01/singles_inferno_confirmed_to_return_for_season_3/j7zqw31/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/10vdoyn/love_is_blind_korea/j7gz987/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10rr1t6/uma_game_episode_4_230202/j77hfij/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10r0dje/kpop_house/j6sw6un/\n\n---\n\n**This thread has the different names of streaming/OTT services (like TVING, Coupang Play, wavve, etc.) or websites and the various Youtube channels and links for where to watch some of these dating shows**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yktjg9/can_anyone_suggest_some_kdating_shows/iuvbg43/\n\n---\n\n**A master list (of Korean dating shows) that some people update fairly regularly**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Igp0Nh8w46uA7uumTYeWoG4wV1kc4BJAn3R4cZgE7Uk\n\n**This is a fan playlist of some Chinese dating shows (often available on Youtube for free through the YOUKU, iQIYI, Tencent Video/WeTV, etc. official channels)**: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNnLfxJ2ybB2BW4sjK1VTinwrySp7A_R\n\n**That playlist of Chinese dating shows also has its own Google Docs sheet for other Chinese (dating and variety) shows**: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12vG-7Qtu5KbNHGHFS8GNzolbf3Lmu_fUA0YL6lGXTAk\n\n---\n\n**Check MyDramaList too for a more visual list of these East Asian variety shows, dating shows, dramas, et cetera**. Some people have their lists with only Korean shows, others Chinese, some combined, et cetera.\n\nOftentimes the commenters on MyDramaList will also post the housemates' Instagram/Weibo/social media/etc. as well as the other info needed to watch the shows.\n\n---\n\n**Shows maybe like Terrace House**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/11omuh3/where_to_find_comfort_now/jbuxsfz/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10pyock/im_just_sad_terrace_house_is_gone_i_miss_them_all/j6ri6vt/?context=10000\n\nTry **Relationship S3/Let's Fall In Love Season 3 (\u6211\u4eec\u604b\u7231\u5427 \u7b2c\u4e09\u5b63), Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81), Heart Signal 3 (Korean version), Friends (Heart Signal spinoff)**, et cetera.\n\n**Heart Signal 4 (Korean Version) is probably airing in May 2023**, so one more month! Heart Signal 4 (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub1104) might be on international Netflix, so they'll probably add English subs. It's been like 3 years since the last Korean Heart Signal. Right now the Chinese version of Heart Signal (\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7) is preparing for its upcoming 6th season.\n\nOh and there's also this more mature Chinese slice of life romcom/drama set in Dali/Yunnan with Liu Yifei or the Mulan actress. It's called **Meet Yourself (\u53bb\u6709\u98ce\u7684\u5730\u65b9)**, here's Episode 1 (with English subs) from the \u534e\u7b56\u5f71\u89c6\u5b98\u65b9\u9891\u9053 China Huace TV Official Channel, but you can also watch it on Viki: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj__X2BRhyo\n\n---\n\n**If you haven't watched the original first season of Terrace House, this is kinda how to watch Terrace House: Boys x Girls Next Door**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zfkwnq/how_do_i_watch_boys_girls_next_door/izchnov/\n\n**The Chinese version of Terrace House, Shanghai Sharelife (/r/Shanghaisharelife), also has proper English subs instead of machine translation**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10e0lg5/that_girl_who_was_obsessed_with_the_noodle_museum/j4oimk9/\n\n---\n\n**This is some other Kdramas/Korean films/East Asian media stuff with romance, slice of life, cohabitation, and so on**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/11omuh3/where_to_find_comfort_now/jbuxtm5/\n\n**Summaries of those Kdramas/East Asian media stuff with romance, slice of life, et cetera**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/11omuh3/where_to_find_comfort_now/jbuz31j/",

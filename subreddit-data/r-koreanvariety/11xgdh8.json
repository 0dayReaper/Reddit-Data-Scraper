Since they're publishing it in order, it feels like the episodes are being aired. The episodes are also split up into 3 parts, so waiting for the different parts brings me back to when I had to wait for like pt 6 of a variety show sub haha.",

Although, those episodes were very much a trial run as 2D1N was previously just a revamp of another show called Are You Ready.\n\nIt wasn't until ep 35, which was about a year in, that they officially stabilized everything, from episode structure to cast members. Before that, it felt like members were coming and going constantly.",

            "comment": "It would be useful to link a video when asking about specific scenes, since not everyone can just open the episode and even if they do, it might be a different release than what you watched and the scene could have a different timestamp. So a YouTube clip of the scene is the best way to get an accurate answer. Also, people usually ask about songs in the comments of the videos, so that can solve the riddle right away.\n\nShazaming the song that plays during that scene (after Woojae stops talking) says that it's [Wonstein - Your Existence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTFWCLeqn04).\n\nEdit: Also, please see the rules in the sidebar. Song/Episode identification posts aren't allowed.",

    "postText": "Title Match Tour Restart! \n\n3 Defeats! 3 Victories! The main mission of Eojjeoda Avengers is never ending. The dreams to become the best amateur soccer team in Korea is not an easy task. You have no where to hide your failure except for learning from it. 3rd Audition? Done. 1 month worth of training and testing the players? Done. What else could the coaches do to bring out the player's best potential to life? All the blood, sweat and tears, only the strongest will have the last laugh. \n\nEpisode 92 will show us the determination of Eojjeoda Avengers in winning the Title Match against AP FC, the supposed Best 11s of Jeolla-do amateur soccer scene. In episode 33, Eojjeoda Avengers was only considered as a 'sparring partner' for them as they were preparing for a big competition. But with the brand-new team, it surely can shakes AP FC's core even just a little bit. Eojjeoda Fc to Eojjeoda Avengers, the relationship between the old and the new players are inseparables. Once together, always together. Even though all the players will be there, only 16 players will be chosen to play on the field. The full roster for Jeolla-do Title Match will remain a mystery for now. \n\nConceded a goal and the crying face of Lee Jang Kun? Looks like JTBC decided to gives us some dramas in the amidst of the most-awaiting episode.  Will the defense line keeps defending or will they keep dragging the whole team down to the deep hole? All the questions will only be answered in Episode 92. \n\n(P.S. 16 Entry System. Who will be in the line-up? Let me know your thoughts down below).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/13awp3y)",

    "postText": "**Disclaimer:** Parts of 'The Genius' and the webshow 'Accomplice' are spoiled in this show.\n\n# Synopsis\n\nIn Treasure Hunt, participants compete in a thrilling and challenging adventure game show where they must use their wits and tenacity to find hidden bags of cash, where the final winner will earn a maximum of 500 million won (roughly $500,000). The competition is fierce, as participants must not only outplay and outsmart their opponents, but also overcome unpredictable situations and obstacles along the way. Through necessary cooperation and fierce conflict, the players aim to find the money in a \u2018finders keepers\u2019 game to become the ultimate winner.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Chambo (Former Accountant, YouTuber)\n* Choi Yongjoon (Former Special Forces)\n* Choi Yousol (Model)\n* Deokja (600K YouTuber, 145 IQ)\n* Gyoju (YouTuber)\n* Jang Jisou (Formerly \u2018Quaddurup\u2019, 1.3M YouTuber, Creator of 'Accomplice')\n* Jeon Gukjin (YouTuber)\n* Johny Kwony (Rapper, University Student - Yonsei University)\n* Kang Daehyung (E1 Marketing Video PD)\n* Kang Han (National Bobsleigh Athlete)\n* Kang Seungmin (Engineering Student - Hanyang University)\n* Kim Jungkyun (MMA Fighter, Fitness Model)\n* Kim Stephany Haery (Model, Influencer)\n* Kim Taeyong (Businessman)\n* Kim U Jungkuk (Magician)\n* Lee Haney (Men\u2019s Magazine Model)\n* Lim Hyunseo (Lawyer and Entrepreneur)\n* Maeng Minho (Samsung Engineer)\n* Nagai Mao (Model)\n* Oh Hyunmin (University Graduate - KAIST, Contestant on 'The Genius S3' and 'Accomplice')\n* Song Youngjae (MMA Fighter, AFC Bantamweight Champion)\n* Viper (MMA Fighter)\n* Yoon Subin (Announcer)\n* Yubi (Broadcast Jockey and YouTuber)\n\n# Episode\n\nOur subtitle files are available for direct download [on our site](https://baechusquad.download/treasure_hunt/).\n\nThis post does not infringe on the copyright for Treasure Hunt.

The main writer is busy with this show which is pretty much TGE in a competition format. \n\n  \nThis one is actually good albeit less fun than TGE because that one really is a mashup of JJY PD's usual stuff + variety.  \n\n\nA rant on the casting directors... We get a variety of men ranging from MMA fighters, to engineers, to IT-company CEOs, to lawyers, to men with a high IQ etc. and then for women, we get models and announcers who all happen to be less than 100 pounds and conventionally attractive.  \n\n\nNo wonder, no one want them on their team, they're pretty much eye-candy for the men participants and the viewers. You can't tell me there isn't any butch korean woman, or someone who has a chance at any physical game. If there is no korean woman like that, atleast cast a foreigner. They managed to cast a foreign man but cannot have a foreign woman just to compensate for the lack of women physical prowess?",

But they were physical to begin with. I'm looking forward to seeing how the female contestants on this show surprise me but yeah, where's the women's MMA champ, the weightlifter, the engineer?\n\nThat said I don't think their talents were adequately represented by their intro cards, and we may find that in being collectively underestimated they may resist backstabbing and work together better even if they aren't as physically imposing as that one brick-shaped dude. Few of the puzzles in TGE required brute strength and most relied on insight and communication. Hopefully we see that in these teams!",

I can already say this is 100x better than TGE. The complexity, puzzle element, and the format is way better. And because all the contestants have their own skillsets then it's not just a couple of guys carrying the whole sausage fest in a scripted show like TGE.",

This show has a real tension and excitement, and they are actually competing for a prize not just hamming it up for entertainment. I like the scenario as well so far, in TGE they had to keep making it 'grander' to beat the scale of the previous scenarios, and it started getting old. In this new show you see the scenarios through the eyes of the contestants and even though it's simpler it feels more exciting.",

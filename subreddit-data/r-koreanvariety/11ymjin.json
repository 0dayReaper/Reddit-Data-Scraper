I'm trying to find it but no luck. \n\nThe show had korean singers/artists and they would hear the instrumental part of their song for a few seconds and then had to sing the lyrics and it keeps going on a few songs.",

I could not imagine how traumatic the wait must have been. I was unaware of the obligation that I MUST respond. To the best of my ability, I will make sure a 30 second time is set the next time I post a question to ensure that I immediately respond. I will not disappoint the public. I will also submit notice to my government to ensure that policies and regulations are in place to ensure this absurdity never occurs again. How dare people have more important things to do than sit by their phones to provide immediate response to their reddit question. This is certainly a priority above all.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nPLUFFY3",

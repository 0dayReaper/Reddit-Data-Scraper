            "comment": "It's a wordplay/pun on Korean words, so it's a little hard to explain but I'll try my best.\n\nSo the original title is \uc218\ud559 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc218\ud559\uc5ec\ud589. If we keep \"\uc218\ud559 (soo hak)\" in without translating, the title is \"Soo Hak Travel Without Soo Hak.\" When a Korean says \"soo hak\", 95% of the time they are referring to \u6578\u5b78, which means math (\u6578 meaning number and \u5b78 meaning study). Therefore, the first part of the title (\uc218\ud559 \uc5c6\ub294) literally means \"no math\".\n\nNow, before going to the second part of the title, it is important to note that many Korean words are etymologically from or influenced by Chinese, so each letter can have multiple meanings. So while \"hak\" in this example translates to study, it can also mean science or crane for example.\n\nKnowing that, let's talk about the second part of the title: soo hak yeo haeng/\uc218\ud559\uc5ec\ud589. \uc5ec\ud589 (yeo haeng) means to travel, so there's not much to explain there. The difference is that \"soo\" in this context does not refer to \"number\" as we previously stated. Instead, it is a different Chinese letter \"\u4fee\", which means \"to build/construct\". So \"soo hak\" in this second part of the title can be loosely translated to mean \"building knowledge\". And thus \"soo hak yeo haeng\" can be translated to \"Travel With The Purpose To Build Knowledge.\n\nSo what is this soo hak travel? In Korea, students in the final year of elementary/middle/high school travel across the country on a multi-day field trip with their teachers and classmates. This is soo hak yeo haeng, as they are taking the field trip together to go to places to learn and have fun. It's a highly anticipated trip because they are spending multiple days together with their friends that usually end in them going to a big amusement park haha\n\nSo the title is essentially a wordplay on \"soo hak\". If you want to loosely translate it, the title would be \"A Multi-Day Field Trip That Doesn't Need Math\".\n\nHope that makes sense!",

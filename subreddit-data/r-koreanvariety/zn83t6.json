    "postText": "Super Action is a variety show about stuntmen with MC Jeon Hyun Moo and 3 judges (one of them is Jang Hyuk).\n\nKinda like SWF with teams and elimination and all that but instead of dancing they're performing short movies full of stunts. It's interesting so far imo.\n\nThe 1st elimination is on ep 3.\n\nWatch on: TvN, Viu.",

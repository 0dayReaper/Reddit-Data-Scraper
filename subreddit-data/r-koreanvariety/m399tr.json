The cast is great as is and new guests would help give poor old Jaesuk a break. Female guests would be nice to see also. Wonder if the girls would convert them to their side or Jaesuk would finally find a bastion (male guests get intimidated so easily) to help hold off the tide of the crazy energy the girls have got.",

They need to figure out how to make a game out of the places.\n\nWe have the same cast, I'm happy. Now improve on the foundations of the other elements. Let's hope for the best :)",

Lee Sang-woo became a muted and had nothing to do in the shooting. Maybe it's because of the hyperactive female MCs overwhelm him, or maybe his personality not suitable with Variety Program. It's very awkward watching the guest didn't contribute anything in a show.\n\nSimilar with Lee Sang-woo, the guest in Episode 5 (Jang Dong-yoon) and Episode 7 (Kim Young-kwang) were overly quiet too. Luckily, Cha Tae-hyun saved the last episode, otherwise i will be disappointed with this show. I hope Season 2 will have more interesting guests.",

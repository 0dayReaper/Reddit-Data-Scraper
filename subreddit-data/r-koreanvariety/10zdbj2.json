But on shows like this and when the playing field is equal, they suddenly realize they ALSO have to have a personality, an interesting talent, and the ability to communicate well. \n\nEveryone is good looking and fit but this can only get you so far. The models really struggle on shows like these. Hard to compete with the successful business owners or CEOs who are almost just as good looking and as fit if not more so.",

Similarly, it seemed like the women couldn't tell when the men weren't interested in them. \n\nFor this group though, I feel like everyone is there to promote their business or increase klout.  Even if there are final pairs, I doubt they would last beyond their initial date, if that even.",

And they both have dogs! \n\nWhy does the 4th woman look so familiar? The 35 yo model. Was she on another dating show? Omg she was!!! It was a youtube Heart Signal spinoff.

Afterall, the office is my favorite comedy tv show of all time. \n\nSo I actually really like those horrid moments of people showing off their charms and it turns out it's just not it, and everyone's dissapointed but trying not to be rude. I especially like it if people are confident about their lackluster charms and can actually laugh at themselves. \n\nI remember one moment from running man: the guest said she has prepared a dance. Her dance was mediocre at best, and she only memorized a part of the song. (Turbo's song) So then quickly after she was done, Haha, YSC and KJK stepped in an danced to the song to sort of show her how it should have been done. Then YJS straight up tells the guest: \n\n&gt; Next time, don't say you have a dance ready if it looks like that. \ud83d\ude02 I don't know if you noticed, but we just cleaned up the mess you made. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI was actually howling.

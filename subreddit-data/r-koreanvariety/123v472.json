If you supposed to be watching Lets Play Soccer 2 with Eng Sub, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!\n\nAs you all know or may not know, 2nd audition happened in episode 85.10 out of 17 participants were chosen through 11 vs 11 soccer match with Eojjeoda Avengers. \n\n\nWho will pass the 3rd audition?\n\nList of passed participants:\n1.

Park Yong Un/ \ubc15\uc6a9\uc6b4 (Foot volleyball/Jokgu) aka the guy that had a soccer match with Eojjeoda Avengers before. Please refer episode 76/ 2023 Ep 4 on Netflix. He was the captain in his team.\n8. Park Jun Yong/ \ubc15\uc900\uc6a9 (MMA)\n9. Kim Kwang Min/ \uae40\uad11\ubbfc (Rugby)\n10. Kim Yong Sik/ \uae40\uc6a9\uc2dd (Taekwondo) aka Target Man and the guy AJH has been looking.\n\nMy prediction:\n-Han Gun Kyu\n-Yu Ri An.....\n-Lee Jun Yi(obviously because he's the maknae and my bias)\n-Park Yong Un\n.........................................................................\n...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWARNING !!!! SPOILERS FOR EP86 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nUpdate for Ep 86;\nAs a result of the 3rd audition, 5 out of 10 players got chosen.\n1. Jang Jeong Min- (Rugby) aka the fastest guy.\n2. Han Gun Kyu (Rugby) GK\n3. Lee Jun Yi (Rugby) aka the new maknae. He replaced Jo Won Woo as a maknae of the team.\n4. Park Jun Yong (MMA) aka bald-headed and high pitch guy.\n5. Kim Yong Sik (Taekwondo) As you all know, AJH is looking for a Target Striker but in this episode he's not sure if Kim Yong Sik is the striker that he wants. Therefore, LDG offered himself to train Kim Yong Sik to become the Target Man that AJH wants.\n\nThe End.\n(P.S. Please read my early post of ep 87 (next episode) for more thoughts, updates, and ranting).",

I cant believe Dong Hyun committed the same mistake in this episode which got him removed after he punched the ball when he was out of the box\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f And the funny thing was the taekwondo GK did the same mistake with ease\ud83e\udd23\n\nDo you think AJH will kick them out of the team? Quite impossible if they want the show to be funny tho.\n\nI think Kim Yo Han can be quite good tho if he work hard.\n\nDong Hyun is inconsistent. I thought he changed after  watching taekwondo' episode. I mean the guy was the OG GK with the old Eojjeoda team.\n\nLee Hyung Taik only likes to punch out the ball. Doesnt even want to jump at high ball and clear it out.",

But they are good to have around definitely, brings a lot of joy and laughter to the team.",

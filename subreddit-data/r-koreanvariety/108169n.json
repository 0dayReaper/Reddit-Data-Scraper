He's too tensed, and always putting his best foot forward when with SeulKi. Or pressured because of the unwanted attention and walking on eggshells around Min Su. With Nadine, he's just goofy and doesn't even try to act cool. Their convos are fun and natural because they have the same wavelength. He's not my type but I find him more endearing and charming when he's relaxed and goofy like that.\n\nIf only this is a Terrace House or (at least Heart Signal) set up where they could stay longer and are more free to hang out with each other, Nadine and Jin Young have a huge chance to hit it off.",

            "comment": "It was surprising to see Seulki choose Jongwoo but when she said she felt comfortable with him, i think it was really sincere. \n\nI think she saw how Jongwoo fought for a chance to be with her and even more so when she realised she had seen him on Instagram. I think she must have felt something when she saw his cafe's instagram (prior to inferno, and she must had already thought well of him) and so it all clicked. (I think this is momentous because she brought it up when she went back to the girls.) I think Jongwoo was fortunate because she saw him outside the context of inferno and maybe dating him in the outside world may have seen plausible to her. And i think that was one part of it. (Its like when you date someone in school in presence of all the cool boys vs. dating him as a person outside. Does it make sense?)\n\nThe other part is that Jinyoung didnt confirm his choice and make her feel safe, which is regretable because what were all the conversations pre and post paradise with Jongwoo for, if not to seal the deal with her? To be fair, she really sincerely confessed her feelings to him, and we saw that he was pleased with her answer. But while he felt safe, he didnt make her feel the same. It is confusing not to know where someone's heart is so i completely understand why she made that decision esp when she had started to open up her heart to Jongwoo. \n\nI also feel like when a woman is highly pursued by others, she would want the other party (whom she wants) to be certain of her. And Jungwoo presented that security. \n\nPerhaps, Jongwoo presented the right balance between Dong Woo and Jinyoung.",

You can't stay mysterious for long. And it does eventually get annoying and tiresome when someone isn't clear in their communication and how they feel about you.

I think it was a very rational decision on Suelki\u2019s part - they\u2019re both the same age, she\u2019s at university, he works in a popular coffee shop - they could be young and date and enjoy their youth together. Though I think it likely won\u2019t last long term tbh.\n\nI\u2019m still pretty shocked though coz she seemed so smitten by JY. I\u2019m pretty impressed that she had enough of his \u201cplayer\u201d energy despite the chemistry, honestly I don\u2019t know if I could\u2019ve done that haha.

I think she just shuns people who want to exert power and control over her. \n\n\nI\u2019m honestly pleasantly surprised by Seulki because I thought she was just using JW as a backup and taking him for a ride. Thought she would be a self-centred princessy type at the beginning but I think she\u2019s really honest and authentic and probably values people who are similar.",

I don't think its an Asian/KR woman thing though (and I'm saying this as a married Asian woman in Asia lol). Most people will want to be in a stable and secure relationship and someone who only has eyes for her. And like the commenter above said, I 100% agree that the vibe she had with JY was sexual chemistry and fleeting, content-wise was so superficial and just banter. It won't last..\n\nI think JY just needs to focus on himself first.",

Some women just like a guy who will take care of them and have eyes only for them. I mean Seulki knew her attraction to JY was purely sexual/physical and she wasn't looking for just that because if she did, then she would have picked him. JY straight up told her that he doesn't know if he will be able to take care of her because he has to focus on himself. No matter how good looking someone is, if you pick a guy that says that, then you are an immature person who sees red flags and runs straight at them \ud83d\ude02At least JY was honest, but still. It's the same with Nadine. She was amazing and probably my 2nd favorite girl from the cast, but she studying to become a doctor and lives in the US. The relationship would be too hard and complicated and that's probably why JY didn't pick her.",

He managed to express his feelings respectfully without pressuring her. Esp in the finale, he didn\u2019t impose any expectations on her and would\u2019ve taken the rejection gracefully.\n\nWhereas Sehoon from S1 very much came across to me as a Nice Guy (ugh).\n\n\nEdit: and Jongwoo\u2019s reply in Ep 7 to Seulki saying she appreciates his efforts with her: \u201cJust because I try hard, doesn\u2019t mean I expect anything in return.\u201d",

Personally, JY was too vague for my liking, the whole mysterious thing just gave me a headache. Seulki probably didnt feel any security from him and decided to go with JW. He got a lot more direct at the end but it was already too late by then. JW reminded me of those second male leads in romance dramas that are always doing their best for the one girl and you always root for them more than the male lead but all their efforts are for naught at the end. So I'm so happy he got his happy ending. People might say he was being too much of a simp or whatnot but I really felt his sincerity and I hope him and SK are dating well (? - Eek, does anyone have an update)",

            "comment": "Wow, I kind of feel bad for Jin-young actually. Especially since a very similar story played out the last time he was on a dating show. A victim of his own success lol. But I also do get the sense that he\u2019s someone who really struggles with expressing his feelings. He\u2019s analyzing in his head and thinking way too far ahead. I feel like he might rationalize this result in his head, saying that he wasn\u2019t in the right place to start a relationship anyways as he\u2019s figuring out his career. I\u2019m rooting for him\u2026 I do feel that there is probably a better match out there for him than seul-ki. \n\nSuch an interesting dilemma for him. And a flip from what other people might struggle with romantically\u2026 he has no issues with popularity. But he struggles with \"landing\" a relationship because he has difficulty expressing his feelings plainly to a girl in a way that reassures her. He's almost a little bit too logical and honest about his thought process, and that doesn't feel romantic or emotionally reassuring for the other person.\n\nMaybe his ideal type isn't lining up with what he actually needs in a romantic partner. He might need someone who is confident, sure of their feelings and the strength of their relationship, given that he is someone who struggles to express his emotions clearly. So someone with emotional expressivity or strength/independence.\n\nAt the end of the day, I personally felt that he was fairly responsible in his intentions and thoughtful about what it means to be in a relationship with someone. I hope he doesn\u2019t doubt himself in the future and that he is able to confidently know that he can (and grow in his ability to) provide the woman he loves with emotional assurance, support, and comfort.",

            "comment": "JW pulled the impossible which was for me to root for him. Earlier on his \"nice guy\" persona was getting on my nerves to the pt where I lost all hope for him. He was aloof and innocent, struggling to read/feel certain situations and acting very sappy.\n\nThe turning point for when JW won me over was at the Paradise date. He really followed thru with the advice from the poem he gave to Seulgi to be himself even when nervous. The chemistry that I didn't see from the two was now evident. From her pov, she was more comfortable around JW and could be herself. As someone who wasn't a big fan of her's early on, I was surprised how pleasant she was -- a side of her's that I didn't see from either dates from DW or JY.\n\nWhy I &amp; so many others ended up rooting for him is because he represents the underdog...the Sean Astin character trying to rescue the popular girl from an arrogant jock in a John Hughes movie. Anyone who has ever experienced one-sided love could relate to how Jungwoo felt throughout his journey.\n\nTo those that feel Seulgi only picked JW to spite JY...get over it! I like JY as well but his steely confidence &amp; charm wasn't the right fit for Seulgi. I thought he had a better connection with Nadine, but I think part of him didn't want to lose to JW. He's used the words \"winning\" multiple times like this is some competition. His wavering pursuit confirmed my suspicion and I'm relieved she didn't fall for it. She even said that given her history of going after guys she liked, infatuation itself wasn't enough for her to make a relationship last. She needed someone who would stay with her and wouldn't partake in playing games. Bottom line: she chose comfortability &amp; vulnerability over excitement &amp; mysteriousness.",

Pretty sure I've crapped on him a few times in these threads, but took a 180 when I saw how he was with Seulki in paradise. He was chill and just gives off this comfortable, no pressure vibe. And when he needs to he clearly expresses how he feels while being sensitive and considerate not to put pressure on the other person. While watching him in Paradise I was thinking \"this is how I would want to be when I really like someone\". I could see them being the kind of couple that are like best friends. It helps they have some commonalities and they're the same age. No denying Jinyoung and Seulki have a different chemistry, but still seems like it would be more of a short-term fling that won't last. \n\nThe other thing I'm happy about is So-e leaving with Sejun. I had my doubts about that one but I think Sejun sincerely expressing himself the night before and how he told her he could sense she was having a hard time and wanted to make her feel better might have made her reconsider how she felt about him. Before that interaction she seemed a little cold toward him after their Paradise date and I think even in Paradise I could kind of feel like she wasn't really into him.\n\nSejeong looked stunning in the selection scene. It's a shame we never got to get to know her more and see how she'd be like in Paradise. She might've taken an L on the show but at least she'll get more modelling gigs now from the exposure. She'll do just fine after the show.\n\nOverall I think I enjoyed this season more than the last. See you all in the next. :)",

SeJun was such a standup guy. Protective but not overbearing, funny but not disrespectful, understanding but not condescending. Soe really got lucky with him and I\u2019m SO happy for her. I wish them a long and happy relationship. \n\nHonestly I never thought much of JongWoo. initially but like he crept into SeulKi\u2019s heart he also crept into mine. He was sensitive and funny and stayed loyal. His heart never wavered. He was always there for SK and she even let her guard down and cried with him. He was straightforward, caring and always tried to make her laugh. He fought so hard for one date with her. The man was fully bracing for heartbreak. He told SK as much and I was exactly like Kyuhyun and DaHee feeling so much pain for him. He never had a chance with Jinyoung in the picture which is why I\u2019m completely SHOCKED that SK chose him. I really thought she would pick JY because he played hard to get. Good nice guys hardly ever win in these kind of shows and mysterious guys like JY are out there collecting a harem. I guess JY would have gotten off Inferno with her if he had just laid his heart on his sleeve that last free date. They spent so much time talking and she gave him so much reassurance but his answers were so off putting. He seems like a great guy but JW was the better man in the end and I\u2019m glad SK got to spend that one night with him in paradise. Of all the three dates she seemed to completely at ease and was so chatty. She even suggested they swim which was a stark contrast to her two other dates. A strong friendship is a good foundation for a relationship and I hope they stay happy together. \n\nI feel sad for Hanbin and Nadine because they were such good people but hopefully they\u2019ll find equally awesome people outside of inferno. This season was SO much better than the first and I hope there\u2019s a third season. \n\nPS: does someone know the cast\u2019s insta handles?",

He is wanted to signal his current position and mostly that's what Seulgi took as a sign of rejection (I don't blame her).

            "comment": "I have mixed feelings about how the ending turned out. On the one hand, I'm happy that seulki and soe chose guys who would clearly treat them so well and provide unmatched security. But, I can't help but have mixed feelings about how in both seasons, the girl in the final pairs are usually less into the guy than the guy is into them. It almost feels like only the guys get to follow their hearts and push for what they truly want, like Sehoun in season 1 and JW here. Meanwhile, Soe and Seulki definitely seemed to be more in love with other people in the show, but chose to let go gracefully and move on. It was just frustrating to me to watch the guys get exactly the girl they first wanted, while the girls had to kind of \"settle\" for someone who liked them more. I mean, SK's decision was so shocking precisely because she clearly was more in love with JY, but chose against that. I'm just tired of watching the guys going for what they want and succeeding while the girls are more \"getting chosen\" than choosing for themselves. Of course, this is not to say that I don't support their decisions, it's just I wonder if they felt less empowered to chase after their true interests? I mean, Soe seemed to be more thankful to Sejun than in love, and same with Seulki. Is this a valid thing to feel or am I somehow misreading? \n\nOn another note, Sejun hands down was the best character this season, man was SO funny. I will never get over that time when he went \"If you guys are gonna be like this, I'm moving to the women's tent.\" Had me in tears, I wish he got more screen time!!",

Also, JW winning the wrestling game was key, because it gave them the opp to find out more about each other and bond well over similar interests. Alas, that was when JY started to \u201close\u201d!",

My take on the FINALE picks, not a lot of surprises of course, apart from Seul-Ki somewhat but that last convo with Jin-Young was pivotal, boy did he scatter. I almost think he did NOT want to be picked? Lol. Like he kept deflecting when she was trying to get an answer, oh I'm still thinking ya'know, so maybe trying to hint at her not to pick him. Like the girls kept saying, you can never really get a read on him. Hope the couple's make it on the outside and stay together but going by season 1 that might be a stretch - trying not be a total cynic! Give me one real couple at least please!  HIGHLIGHTS:  1# It was cute and funny with Nadine and Seo-eon shouting HOT GIRLat Se-jeong's bio during the group fire sitdown. 2#Jong-woo crying is a cathartic-mood, coz yes made me cry at the fire huddle, he was so emotional boy. 3# Se-jun awed by Nadine's studies and being all cute in treating her like a wise elder hahaha - and also when he gives her a comforting pat on the back earlier, he's such a sweatheart. 4# Jong-woo still feeling like the younger one to Han-bin when it's revealed he's a year younger - CRACKED me up.. 5# Seo-eon really graciously reflecting on her time with the group and wishing to build on that after inferno. CURIOUS: Does anyone know if Seo-eun also a native English speaker, her accent was really clear when she was chatting to Nadine.",

I really enjoyed this season and the big twist at the end, as much as I was rooting for Jongwoo I really didn't think he'd get picked but I was so happy when he did.

You felt it since ep1 that he's only got the eyes for Seul-ki and really took care of her while she was there. JW was her safe space. Also, I think she realized in the end that JY seems like the type that will keep dangling her and make her doubt her affections. Their story is straight out of a kdrama.\n\nIn the same vein, we have Sejun who also only had his eyes on So-E since he set foot on the island. I knew they were going to end up together, but it was still fun to watch. He was not So-E's dream guy, but he came at the right moment and swept her off her feet. \n\nYongJae and Seu-un were also another endgame couple. They reciprocated early on their feelings to each other, they feel like more friends who became lovers.\n\nI hope these 3 couples last. I'll probably google them months from now just to see how they're doing and if they're still together. Heck, they made me invest time and tears on this show, I want to know those tears were shed for a good cause! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Han bin, Sejeong, Nadine, you all deserve better, and hope you find true happiness outside this show. Okay Dong Woo and Minsu, you too, but these two kinda came on too strong, stubborn, and a tad bit arrogant, so obvs not my faves, but still wish them the best.",

That maturity also explains why jongwoo got hyung vibes from him despite hanbin being younger. Please give this guy a trophy!!",

The mud game didn't matter, him coming up to her and saying he was choosing someone he was curious about was the real game over. \n\n- Honestly, I have a hard time getting mad at Seulki.  Especially, considering that SK and JW seem to be dating now. Watching their Paradise date was nice. They did give off a friendly vibe but you could see how much Seulki appreciated him.\n\n- SE liked YJ the most out of all the guys, but I don't think it was a high enough bar.\n\n-  all Nadine's dates were too serious, it was generally an information exchange, either because she is too awkward or the guys she was on a date with weren't focused on her. JY making motorbike sounds was hilarious tho.",

The girl does not deserve the hate. She actually showed a lot of personality in the last few episodes and it took her time to warm up to people. Yes, she is awkward but she is blunt when she wants to be, she's in one of the best colleges in the country for her major, you can see her ambitions and struggle by the way she talked about it on the show. \n\nI was the one who commented earlier that the girl is ridden with pretty privilege and does not have an interesting personality because of it BUT I was partially wrong. Yes she has pretty privilege but no she is not a simpleton. She is awkward, but she is herself. I didn't even like her but I appreciate the smart choice she made at the end of the show and all this unnecessary hate over her choice or other shit is UNWARRANTED guys stop spouting hate on her\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\n\nBtw her choice makes sense because JY kept stringing her along. She told him point blank that she likes him on D-1 day BUT JY did not give her the clarity. Imagine being in a relationship with someone where you are constantly worried, and this was even before they could choose someone to be coupled with. Communication is key! What did you do JY\ud83d\ude10People should go after him if they doubt this decision not this girl. \n\np.s. Sejun, Nandine and Hanbin were MVPs, and pot stirrer of the year award goes to our funny BDE guy JY\ud83c\udfc6",

I quickly got annoyed with JY because of his wishy washiness with all the girls, and felt as if the chemistry between him and SK was just physical/sexual. \n\nIt felt as if once Jungwoo started approaching SK he felt the need to 'win' and constantly approached her to talk but never really talked about anything in the end- this was especially clear with his question at the fireplace and how inconsiderate it was to pressure SK and put her on the spot like that just so he can put himself up and JW down.\n\nHe was well aware about how she felt with him but always lead her on and played hot and cold. Glad Seulki chose Jungwoo despite obviously being more into JY because the two of them could actually  'last' if they were to date compared to JY and SK who would probably just have some sort of situationship where Seulki gets her feelings hurt imo",

And to think I started watching the show cause of one clip of Soe &amp; Sejun on the helicopter lol.\n\nFirst, I really like all of the friendships that have formed in this show. My favs gotta be Hanbin &amp; Soe and Nadine &amp; Jongwoo. It was so heart-warming to see Hanbin saying Soe is the most important person for him in Inferno and how she also thought the same way. I hope all of the friendships stay even after show.\n\nFor the endgame couples, I was really rooting for Sejun &amp; Soe and I'm so happy they actually leave Inferno together. It's really cute how they're both wearing white. I love how natural &amp; organic they feel (despite some people insisting their scenes were scripted which I didn't believe at all). Both Sejun &amp; Soe are very honest with each other and they communicate well with each other. Really, their chemistry is just so good.\n\nAnd Soeun &amp; Youngjae is already a locked couple since a long time ago. They really felt like newlyweds at Paradise. Jongwoo &amp; Seulki was quite a shock but it's something that I can see happened after their Paradise date since both are the same age. It was actually quite fun to see both Jinyoung &amp; Dongwoo being humbled at the end \ud83d\ude02.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the show especially after Sejun joined since he's a funny guy and had bring more humor to the show.\n\nedit: Also, I think Seulki chose Jongwoo because he was always direct of his feelings towards her. On the other hand, Jinyoung always seems like he is confused between choosing Seulki &amp; the other girls. Perhaps if he had been honest when they went to get water, the result would be different. Happy for Jongwoo though for showing sincerity wins.\n\nedit2: [a new picture of all the casts from Jongwoo's IG story](https://twitter.com/kdramasizt/status/1613036298490773504?s=20&amp;t=pYXfGaPE_OZEWxwdNHS08Q). Nadine &amp; Seulki had also updated pictures of the casts on their instagram. Seems like all of the casts have followed each other rn.\n\nedit3: [Soe actually visited Sejun's tailor shop omg!](https://twitter.com/yeanskii/status/1613117889170780162?s=20&amp;t=yz_kO9aY0ucgtMsh7SLVkA)",

I know a lot of people here are calling him a simp, but like you said I think he was very respectful and was managing his own expectations regarding Seulki's decision. \n\nJinyoung was too wishy washy, I don't blame her for not picking him in the end, despite their chemistry. I think she also probably spent more time getting to know Jungwoo and he's much easier to read than Jinyoung.",

It's a variety show with a guest that gives a 1 day lecture to a cast of celebrities. They pretty much reused that lecture in this episode. Both shows are wandering between 1 - 2%. I'm don't think this episode would get higher viewership domestically especially with older folks when they're talking about toxic parent relationships.",

I see plenty of RM episode under last PD and new PD that kinda meh but at least I saw that they are trying something, but it's just not a correct answer.

He took a show that was making headlines for how much advertisement revenue it was bringing it and made it into...this. Someone else mentioned it but Mijoo is a very capable entertainer. But even she seems like she's at a loss most of the time. Also, they brought in JJH for a little bit and then he just disappears from the episode? I'll admit he's not my favorite member but I've never seen a show just disregard an entire cast member like that. It's fortunate that the cast is quite experienced and hardworking because otherwise the current production team would have sunk it to the ground completely.",

It is reserved for dedicated comedians (dedicated in the sense that these comedians practice performing and writing comedy skits and bits daily).\n\nIt's not something that you can throw in a bunch of celebrities or entertainers and expect them to perform well. That's just my two cents though. I'd rather prefer the HDYP cast to interact with real people. Those episodes have a lot of heart (and is pretty funny too)!",

Jinjoo and Mijoo's presence was big and I think they did not bad playing the \"dumb\" and annoying junior detective. Yikyung kind of just disappears probably due to the concept. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Quite interesting to see them bring in an actual actor for next week. !&lt;However, I don't see this arc continuing in the long run. I can see it getting more boring as time goes. While I like the occasional &gt;!team vs team game, this reminds me of a miniature version of old days RM!&lt;, which is not what HDYP is known for. HDYP is known for its projects and its versatility (both for the PD and YJS)...",

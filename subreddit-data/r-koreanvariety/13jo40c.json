    "postText": "**Heart Signal 4 (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub1104)** is finally here after 3 years.\n\n---\n\nSynopsis:\n\n&gt; Cupid returns for a fresh assault on the hearts of a new group of romance-ready singletons. The group has never met before, but must live together in Signal House. The house rules encourage flirty behavior, but forbid housemates from directly telling anyone that they like them. Instead, they must express their feelings via text message. But there\u2019s a twist: All texts to housemates are anonymous \u2013 meaning recipients have to guess who is trying to make a love connection with them.\n\n&gt; Watching events unfurl in the house is a celebrity panel of love experts. These include returning romance fans Yoon Jong Shin, Kim Ea Na, and Lee Sang Min, all veterans of previous \u201cHeart Signal\u201d seasons. And joining this trio this time around is a fresh crop of star pundits, including OH MY GIRL member Mimi, Kang Seung Yoon of WINNER, and leading psychiatrist Kim Chong Gi.\n\n&gt; This variety TV show series is the follow-up to 2017\u2019s \u201cHeart Signal.\u201d A second series was released in 2018. And this was followed up with Season 3 in 2020.\n\n&gt; \u201cHeart Signal 4\u201d is a 2023 South Korean reality TV/variety show that was produced by Park Cheol Hwan.\n\n---\n\n#Cast\n\nLee Jumi (\uc774 \uc8fc\ubbf8)\n\nKim Jiyoung (\uae40 \uc9c0\uc601)\n\nKim Jimin (\uae40 \uc9c0\ubbfc)\n\n\\-\n\nShin Mingyu (\uc2e0 \ubbfc\uaddc)\n\nHan Gyeore (\ud55c \uaca8\ub808)\n\nYoo Jiwon (\uc720 \uc9c0\uc6d0)\n\n---\n\n#Panelists\n\nKim Eana\n\nLee Sangmin\n\nYoon Jongshin\n\nKang Seungyoon (from WINNER group)\n\nKim Mihyun or Mimi/\ubbf8\ubbf8 (from OMG group)\n\nKim Chonggi (psychiatrist)\n\n---\n\n#Subtitles\n\nSubtitles | | \n---------|----------|\nStream | [Viki](https://www.viki.com/tv/39844c-heart-signal-4)\nStream | [KOCOWA](https://www.kocowa.com/en_us/season/77851672/heart-signal-4)\n\nFrom [vodizt](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/13jo40c/heart_signal_4_episode_1_230517/jklqta2/), English subtitles for Viki (resync for 1:51:11): https://subscene.com/subtitles/heart-signal-4-4/english/3092753\n\n---\n\n**Heart Signal Youtube channel or \ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110 \ub77c\ube44\ud2f0\ube44 channel**: https://www.youtube.com/@channelA-heartsignal/videos\n\nHeart Signal 4 teaser videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95SLY5leyZE and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naY8aypAjbo\n\nHeart Signal 4 teasers playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFIYUdSkjiCAuWe006VqSTFfaE7rgIHNy\n\nHeart Signal 4 production stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46UmvFNwi9Q\n\n---\n\n**Heart Signal 4 commentary with Heart Signal 2 Jaeho and some other people**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRuQmQUKLvQ\n\nGaheun (Heart Signal 3 and Friends) and Jaeho with the Heart Signal 4 house: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86F9hZ-7nxc\n\nJangmi (Heart Signal 2 and Friends) and Jaeho with the Heart Signal 4 house: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAcupLirqOk\n\nHeart Signal 4 Official BGM Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8djlZk6ZeM0\n\n---\n\nIs anybody gonna do the discussion threads for Heart Signal 4? Putting this thread up just in case.\n\nBy the way fam, there's the **Chinese version of Heart Signal (\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7)**. Due to certain pairings, ships, situations, et cetera, Season 2 and the recently completed Season 5 are preferred by some people over the other Korean/Japanese/etc. dating shows. They're preparing for Season 6 of the Chinese version of Heart Signal now.\n\nFor Heart Signal, the original Korean version and some seasons of the Chinese version should be on Viki. For the first season of the Korean version, it's on OnDemandKorea.\n\nWith the Chinese version of Heart Signal, it's available on the WeTV/Tencent Video website (has English subs), and also their WeTV/Tencent Video channels on Youtube for free but without proper English subs.\n\nThrough the Tencent Video Youtube channel you'll have to use auto-translate from Chinese/Mandarin or maybe say Thai, Vietnamese, etc. So for English subs you have to check their own WeTV/Tencent Video/etc. website.\n\n---\n\nThere's like 12 hours left for Heart Signal 4's release. It's possible to [rewatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/12ccjku/can_someone_give_me_a_list_of_korean_variety/jf16a56/) Season 2 of both the Korean and Chinese version of Heart Signal during that time as the subtitles will probably take another 12 hours to 24/36+ hours.\n\nOn Viki, somebody presumably from the Cupid Returns Team (FIFTY FIFTY - Cupid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc7_zRjH808) said that this will be around 70 minutes per episode and that the subtitled episodes will release every Wednesday (so like 24 hours after it airs in Korea). \n\nBack then some of us would watch the episodes with partial English/Spanish/etc. subs even if it didn't say it's 100% complete yet, lmao.\n\nSo apparently **Heart Signal 4 may have 14 episodes** (each episode about ~70 minutes long), and so with one episode per week (hopefully no major [spicy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os_heh8vPfs) controversies/et cetera affecting the schedule or production), that's 14 weeks of Heart Signal 4, lol. Get ready for the constant cliffhangers and tension.",

Not a fan of bunkbeds/sharing a room w that many people. But it def looks like 1 more man and woman are coming in.\n\nDammmn was not expecting joo mi to get 2 votes. That was misleading editing. Also jimin is def getting the villain edit already. The way the panel made such a big deal over her saying \"okay\" \ud83d\ude02\n\nI have never seen a 20-something year old not know how to chop an onion. \n\nJoo mi asking jimin if she was just gonna stand there was also unexpectedly aggressive.\n\nThe music and the panel are making the women seem so calculative! This feels very biased. I can see Jimin making some comments on purpose to be flirtacious (like the one about becoming quiet when drinking if she's around someone she likes) but this whole women competing for attention and keeping each other in check thing feels icky. It's not that deep. \n\nOmgggggg i forgot how lee sang min would say each character of each person's name so slowly before revealing who they texted \ud83d\ude02 so dramatic\n\nHmmmmmm i will def keep watching, i think i like jimin, GR, and jiwon so far. Next ep w the first dates and job/age info should be interesting.",

I took food &amp; nutrition classes in high school starting at 13 so even if my chopping skills suck I am at least probably not going to hurt myself. I remember when I went to uni at 18 and there were lots of people who had never cooked a meal for themselves before, but this girl has to be at least early 20s right? The lack of basic life skills is unattractive to me but for her, the \"omg what do i do help me\" energy seems to be working.",

Felt bad for Joomi, she seemed to struggle in the latter half of the episode, hopefully she takes it in stride and isn\u2019t deterred by it! \n\nThe guys are kinda just there, but I enjoyed them having absolutely no poker face when a girl they liked was in the room! \n\nThe previews showed dates between Jimin and Min Kyu (should be interesting as that man is so obviously into her), Ji Young and Gyeo Re (wonder if they are going to be the couple that sticks together the whole season, don\u2019t really love that bc I\u2019m a sucker for drama), and Joo Mi and Ji Won (curious to see if Joo Mi will become more proactive bc of the no text thing).",

She has plenty of charms and has been sweet of the two other girls, but panelist keep painting her as the vixen/fox where JY gets the sweet innocent image and constantly gets complimented on how sweet and innocent she is. Just like Jimin she knows her charms how to play it, but Jimin gets called out for it when she does it? JY also played super helpless during the cooking scene like Jimin. I like JY she\u2019s got rizz, but I just hate it that Jimin is hated for having rizz game too. \n2. I liked Jumi at first, she was bit catty during the cooking scene. It rubbed me off the wrong way. I hope this changed later. \n3. For the boys, MK is my personal fave. \nMy prediction for the next episodes: \nJW \u2014-&gt; JY and vice Versa \nMK \u2014-&gt; and Jimin and vice versa \nJumi will still go for MK and GY for Jimin.",

            "comment": "Watched it without subs and understood most of it since they didn't really talk too much out of context. So far, not really impressed by anyone but not because of their appearances or anything, more so that they all seem...predictably boring.  I found myself actually just looking forward to the panelists cuz there was not much else going on.\n\nOn my first impressions of the girls, ***Jiyoung*** stands out because she is cute and knows it. She's got her preferences and is not afraid to go for it which is why she's top in votes as expected. Not much to say other than that she's a natural at striking the balance b/w being innocent and showing enough experience to not be underestimated. ***Jimin*** makes me uncomfortable with how proactive she is but she does feel the youngest of the bunch and seems to genuinely be uncomfortable when attention is not on her so it makes sense. With how readily she accepts praise and how much she tries to get attention, she defo feels like a c-list celeb or someone who has to constantly vie for the spotlight. It may work in the short term but unless she shows us growth or a reversal, I don't see anyone really choosing her in the end. ***Joomi*** feels the oldest or at least the most mature. She's the one that I would choose if I was a guy there since she's nice to people, helps out others without hesitation, and seems to be independent. I dislike it when someone unironically acts helpless and needs others to do something simple for you so she's got top marks from me for forging her own path. She doesn't seem the type to proactively ask out others first or feel the need to heavily appeal herself which will work against her but I'm hoping she'll get through that hurdle and even if she ends up with nobody here, she should be better for it.\n\nThe guys are a lot less exciting than expected. They seem kind of nice but also don't seem able to lead the group or give us anything to work with. ***Gyore? Gyole?*** is straightforward and while I get not wanting to mislead others, his one track mind this early on has already closed off all the other girls which means if he does get a date with them, it's gonna be super uncomfortable. This would be fine 2-3 eps in if he's gotten to know the others and decided on Jinyoung but his one pick at first sight is not the most exciting thing to watch. ***Jiwon*** feels the most experienced but also gives off this air of being manly. However, as the ep progresses, he seems to be a lot more mild than expected so like a mix between how Mingyu and Gyole came off. He also seems to like Jiyoung but is receptive of Jimin's advances so he will likely be a central character in the upcoming eps. ***Mingyu*** interests me the most, but only because I can't really tell what's going on in his mind. He doesn't care much for screentime (he doesn't act out or show reactions) which means he's likely not in Heart Signal for blatant promotional purposes so if it's love, him choosing Joomi then Jimin threw me for a loop. The only explanation for having such different preferences is if he gave a pity vote to Joomi for being nice and then chose Jimin who paid attention to him. Either way, he seems like he'll either turn out to be a sleeper hit or become a hopeless Jimin chaser.\n\ntldr; Never know if I should put this before the wall of text or after but as it is, my final thoughts on ep 1 is meh. Hopefully I'm proven wrong and the 2 members they add will spice things up so we can get a bit of that S2 magic because as it is, I don't really feel too invested in any of these casts. Also knowing Mimi, I can't wait for her to come out swinging with some super hilarious out of the left field comment after the psych professor's insightful and erudite-sounding one.",

Although, I'd be dumb if I believed appearances didn't matter. Unless you get a cast like Love Catcher's Bali ver where every single girl was gorgeous and only differed in styles and personality, it's kinda understandable the prettier ones stand out at first.

Like she's a grown adult, you don't have to suddenly pity her, that's disrespectful to her in  a way.\n\nAnd agree, waiting for the catfish too!",

While I understand there's a reason why underdogs are so compelling, labeling one in a budding relationship makes it feel like there has to be a victor and subsequently a loser, which just makes the whole thing feel wrong.\n\nAlso speaking on the topic of confidence, you're right that all 3 girls are definitely confident in their own way. You can be confident about your looks, your ability to flirt, etc. but Jumi's confidence is more about how she comes off as not needing to engage in stuff like Jiyoung's admittedly cute nose wrinkle whenever she smiles or Jimin's calculated flirting attempts. It's also an impression I've gathered from edited scenes in the 1st ep so she could turn out to be completely different irl or likely as the season progresses.\n\nedit: went off topic. edited to cut that down.",

This timeframe will sometimes vary, and as such don't be surprised in the future if they take ~24 hours to sub an episode that has more dialogue/conversation/etc. between the cast and also panelists.\n\n**Heart Signal 4 Episode 1 on Viki with English/etc. subtitles: https://www.viki.com/videos/1230170v-heart-signal-4-episode-1**\n\n**Heart Signal 4 Episode 1 on KOCOWA: https://www.kocowa.com/en_us/media/78044416/heart-signal-4-episode-1**\n\nFor VIU (Singapore/Malaysia/Philippines/etc.), somebody should get the direct link for it (if you live outside (Southeast Asia) and visit the VIU website, it will say \"No Service\" or something like that, so need to use VPN/etc. to even just easily navigate the site) or I'll find it later. I'm going back to sleep, lol.\n\nAs it's been for years now, for those that need access to these Korean variety shows, Kdramas, et cetera, there's still ArmsAsuncion's website for redditors, I linked it earlier in some of the thread links I posted before.\n\n---\n\nAs for the initial reviews, this 4th season is a bit unexpected. It opens with the visuals guy and his dirtied shoes, and then he's like hiding his coat on the floor between or behind couches. Kinda unconventionial, even the panelists were baffled, rofl.\n\nThe female housemate favored by the audience or livestream chat from the Heart Signal (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110 \ub77c\ube44\ud2f0\ube44) channel is said to be realistic instead of playing it up for attention. Like some people say the scenes are a bit too contrived/setup/etc. but that female housemate remains pretty resolute with her own personality, as in like it seems she's not overly adjusting/changing her personality to perform for the show.\n\nThen for the other two female housemates, the vocal commenters have more of the usual misogynistic/troll/etc. stuff and so it's somewhat hard to get a read on what people really think as they figure that this 4th season is more scripted or produced like a drama, lmao.\n\nFor the male housemates, one of them is also just like the female housemate favored by some of the audience. Like they're focused on being somewhat cold or not as easygoing.\n\nAnd then the other two male housemates are kinda opposite. One of them will probably be considered way too laid back (he fades in the background), though that's probably because he had no sleep before this first introduction day. And then the other is more of like a moodmaker or life of the party as he tries to make more of an effort with breaking the ice or getting people to somewhat talk/interact with each other.\n\nSome people said there's nothing really standing out with this new 4th season of Heart Signal and so that's why people in the chat/comments/etc. were saying to bring out the catfishes already to spice things up, rofl.",

Miss those wild early streaming/meme years.\n\nAnyway, apparently at least one of the guys is like 30 years old and then one of the girls is like way younger, wait let me check nahonjaboda's Twitter.\n\n**Do not click or read below unless you want the possible name (and Instagram/social media), age, and occupation of the cast/housemates spoiled/revealed/et cetera**. \n\nUh, apparently years later for some mobile users (with the official app and third party apps for reddit) the spoiler tags and such don't work. So that's out of my control, sorry team, it works on desktop/PC and Old Reddit though.\n\n---\n\nShort-haired girl (getting her makeup done in a different channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE-KcfRgpbs) featured a lot in the teasers: &gt;!Kim Jiyoung (born 1995): Model, former flight attendant for Korean Air. Instagram: _diyom_!&lt;\n\nGirl that sorta looks like (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95SLY5leyZE&amp;t=67s) WJSN (THE BLACK)/Cosmic Girls SeolA: &gt;!Lee Jumi (born 1994): Lawyer. Instagram: 2dumi!&lt;\n\nVisuals girl (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naY8aypAjbo&amp;t=56s), she looks like a Kdrama actress or Kpop idol: &gt;!Kim Jimin (born 2000): Influencer/model. Instagram: loeweruby!&lt;\n\nVisuals boy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95SLY5leyZE&amp;t=70s), he looks like an idol with his hairstyle and fashion: &gt;!Shin Mingyu (apparently around 30/31) - Strategy Consultant, fellow \u00e9tudiant/r\u00e9volutionnaire, Instagram: Mingingyo. Youtube: \uace0\ub300\ub85c (https://www.youtube.com/@user-oy4yb8lz1d/videos)!&lt;\n\n---\n\nSo they are actually &gt;!on the older side!&lt; even though they look kinda young, lol. Remember usually in these dating/cohabitation shows, sometimes there's mainly 18-24 years old housemates/contestants. The mid-late 20s or 30s housemates often get ignored unless the other people are of similar age.\n\nPersonally with Heart Signal 4, I was disappointed because of the lack of visuals (lol wtf). This may change after the first episode releases, though I doubt it as I'm pretty accurate with my preferences.\n\n---\n\nLike after watching the trailer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0isy6O5UcNo) for **Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac)**, the bar was just set so high, to outer space/interdimensional (UAP/USO/etc.) territory, for the visuals of Heart Signal/Single's Inferno/EXchange or Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560)/other Korean dating shows.\n\nLove Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac) has unparalleled (female) visuals and so on compared to other dating shows, and as some /r/noveltranslations and /r/ProgressionFantasy (Chinese/Korean/Japanese/East Asian/etc.) web novels will say, it's like the difference between heaven and earth.\n\nBelow are the direct links to TVING/Love Catcher in Bali clips, don't worry it's not really spoilers as they're just chilling.\n\nThese are the female housemates of Love Catcher in Bali: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpPl9mP35ik\n\nThese are the male housemates of Love Catcher in Bali: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VawZKpDWIY4\n\nKorean/Chinese/etc. dating show visuals: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/12ijnjc/dating_shows/jfve2v6/\n\nSome new Chinese dating shows have really nice visuals too, like Sun Xiu and Wu Shuyang (Little Wu or \u5c0f\u5434) from **Twinkle Love Season 2 (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81 \u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b63)**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFBC-aR2tmk&amp;t=1324s\n\nAnd right now for **Yes, I Do Season 4 (\u559c\u6b22\u4f60\u6211\u4e5f\u662f4)**, there's Xu Zihan (Aria Xu): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqkOGp2dQqw&amp;t=2504s\n\n---\n\nOh and as for the love triangles or interesting catfishes and so on. Supposedly the visuals guy will end up with, hold on, it's just probably rumors but sometimes people be leaking the whole plot (this is more so for the Chinese dating shows, not as much with Korean shows, avoid the Youtube comments and social media comments as in do not Google Translate/etc. the text), so let's not even bother guessing and enjoy the show blind, rofl.",

They literally go on a date instead of quickly buying groceries as they were supposed to come home cook. What happen to \"Sorry we're late\" and \"Do you want to join us eat\". She was happy cooking for two.\n2. They cooked instant food while knowing they were supposed to cook dinner. Even gyorae cooked proper meal the night before.\n3. Jimin KNEW Jumi was not in a good mood and STILL, choose to brag about her \"date\" with mingyu. Jumi changed subjects 5 times to change the topic but Jimin repeatedly talked about how she got picked up by mingyu. Mingyu was making excuse and comforting Jumi but Jimin still keep going. Plus it's not like Jimin liked Mingyu I really don't understand her at all.\n4. Jimin literally asked \"Why unnie did something happened?\" sarcastically to Jumi after Jumi asked \"Are you feeling good?\"\n\nMind you, Jumi is 7 years older than Jimin. Idk how it is in your culture but the way she talk is quite rude to me. It's not what she said it's the intonation while grinning and side eyeing. Idk how would you call Jimin behaviour and that's up to you but if there's one person that's rude, it's definitely not Jumi.\n\nBruh, she literally did most of the house chores. Her being mad about dinner is realistic. No, honestly if they apologize if would've been sooo much better. I would've been worse than Jumi tbh.",

Am I the only one who actually guesses along with the panelists in each epislde? \n\nAnyway, here are my thoughts:\n\n- Everyone is sooo good-looking but Ji Young just blew my mind. Like, surely God plays favorites among humans!\n\n- The women have very different looks and personalities which is obvious on episode 1 while the men seem to like the same fashion styles and appear to be all observant and thoughtful. I like them all! \u2661 \n\n- I am glad there is no overly giddy girl among the women. How I hope no one turns out to be like that. Please, don't. \n\n-  My first impression favorites are Ju Mi and Ji Won. \n\nJu Mi is the independent  girl type who also looks out for other people. She just makes me wanna root for her, especially after the guys' reaction to Ji Young. \n\nJi Won's smile is \u2661 omg. I can already sense he would be a favorite. \n\n- There seems to be a really good mix of characters in this season. May the editing be fair and may they all find love. lol. \u2661",

It\u2019s not wrong to do things to with motive to attract men, but it felt constant throughout the episode. I feel like her real personality is someone who is headstrong and cool (how she composed herself after getting 0 votes and picked herself back up), so to see such an opposite personality and act in front of the men was really jarring and didn\u2019t feel honest to who she really is (which is someone who I think I\u2019d actually really like!)",

She started approaching it like a challenge to get the attention of the guy(s) she was interested in. If I was in her shoes in that place tho I would probably do something really similar personally. Im not there to make friends im trying to get a boo thang. I have enough friends. Im going to be as confident and the best version of myself as possible and make the best first impression possible. Because after seeing so many dating shows people really fall in love with the first impression and it goes a long way.\n\nAlso I don't think we know who she is off of one episode, to say that she is not being authentic. also people have different sides to them, is it possible she can be headstrong and cool, but also cute and ditsy depending on the environment? I don't act the same way around my crushes as I do around a bunch of dudes. I agree she was playing it up and trying to capture attention, but all the girls were doing that, all the girls were competing, why is she being singled out, because she was a little more bold with it?\n\nEdit: Im open to being wrong, maybe i'm biased because I kinda fell in love when she walked up to the house so confidently with the pink jacket so It's possible im seeing her with rose tinted glasses.",

Maybe nerves got the best of her or maybe we didn\u2019t get to see everything (it is the first episode after all). As far as a villain (I have seen some people say she will painted as a villain) I don\u2019t see her as a villain at all. However, the way she was in the kitchen was off putting, mainly because I work with someone who is literally like that 90%  so it\u2019s off putting. On the other hand I can see how her getting no votes made her want to be more assertive and straight forward. Maybe she will find a happy medium, maybe she won\u2019t, we won\u2019t know unless we keep watching. \nAnd quite honestly, I think they zoom in on certain things people do and everyone\u2019s facial expression to make it more dramatic. Either way, I have my favorites and my not so favorites. Future episodes will tell whether my favorites change or not.",

Or for the English/etc. subtitles if it's not simulcast, then 6/12/24 hours later.\n\nSome people will probably post the links and so on later though, so it's just for those of us that are in certain groups or communities and want a clean and fast schedule. \n\nBecause sometimes people will spoil the whole episode before the subtitles are up, lol.

This is a highly anticipated show, so it'll probably be everywhere.\n\nUsually for the Korean and Japanese dating shows, they only release the 1st episode or so on Youtube for free (almost always without English/etc. subtitles). \n\nCheck the ABEMA channel (ABEMA \u604b\u611b\u3010\u516c\u5f0f\u3011, https://www.youtube.com/@Love_ABEMA/videos) on Youtube for the Japanese dating shows like Heart Signal Japan, Romance Before Debut (\u30ed\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306f\u3001\u30c7\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u524d\u306b\u3002), Shuffle Island (\u30b7\u30e3\u30c3\u30d5\u30eb\u30a2\u30a4\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9), et cetera. \n\nUnfortunately Viki/VIU/etc. never pick those Japanese shows up, like in general nobody really subtitles the Jdoramas and Japanese variety shows, so it's hard to access the content.\n\nHeart Signal Japan from the ABEMA Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2DWOkvRPRQ\n\nBut for the Chinese dating shows from YOUKU, iQIYI, WeTV/Tencent Video, etc. they will often have the whole season for free on Youtube but with decent enough or often machine-translated English subtitles. Or sometimes they won't have English subs and so you have to use Youtube auto-translate from Mandarin/Vietnamese/etc. to English/your desired language.",

People kept asking for Heart Signal 2 Hyunwoo, Heart Signal 3 Euidong, and like Single's Inferno 2 Dex/Jinyoung, rofl.\n\nWow, so that wasn't what I expected. Like the girls were more proactive and it was much more jovial compared to Season 3's beginning and overall atmosphere. The girls this season also got some of that somewhat direct tension/conflict between each other already.\n\nI actually preferred the slow burn of Season 3 instead of this somewhat fast-paced Season 4. But this is going to be a hit for those that like that type of sorta hurried tempo. Gonna miss that more slice of life or idyllic cinematography and such elements though.\n\n---\n\nKim Eana is consistently the best visual in the Korean version of Heart Signal. Kinda wild how that's the case still, Kim Eana needs to write a song about Heart Signal. Like I said a few times before, imagine if Hyojin, Taeeun, Suji/etc. from Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac) were cast for Heart Signal 4 instead, just wow.\n\nAnd then if Jeonghyeon was competing with Mingyu and Jiwon of Heart Signal 4. That would've been undoubtedly the best initial housemates.\n\nAnd fam, why didn't the PDnims ask Karina to be part of the panelist team. Karina is literally ulzzang with Jimin, wtf. Imagine if SM didn't have that HYBE/Kakao/Lee Sooman/etc. struggle and delayed the comeback of their artists, aespa would've actually had their first full album instead of just another mini album and Karina would've had free time to be on Heart Signal 4.\n\nKarina is mad chaotic sometimes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDJgn7A7SRs&amp;t=323s), like Jimin, lol. They the same name. \n\nThe OTP couple seems locked right in the beginning, that's kind of wild since it's the girl that took the initiative. Usually it takes a few more episodes before it materializes, but yup, those two are going to continue with their constant skinship and flirting. Even if they are still entertaining other options. It could be a red herring though, you never know how the catfishes will display themselves.",

She knows she's cute and pretty and it's the truth, there's nothing wrong with that. Honestly, I like the three women participants, they make a good dating show, being proactive in the beginning. Among the guys, I have to give it to Gyeo Rye for being proactive. (There's nothing wrong with taking time too.) The first episode is quite intense already, the kitchen psychological battle was brutal. \n\nI know Heart Signal has this competition among the panel but I do not like how they overthink every move of the participant, it's like watching shipping videos on YouTube.\ud83d\ude06 Anyway, KSY is one of the panel, he did well in Sum+fing. He was hilarious in that one. \n\n&gt; [*spicy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os_heh8vPfs) controversies/et cetera\n\nBTW I love how you incorporated that link!",

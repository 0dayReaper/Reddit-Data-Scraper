I am up to ep 235 but I don\u2019t see anymore discussion threads past that. It seemed to stop. And I don\u2019t see any recent weekly discussion for it either. Did it stop for some reason? It\u2019s not like everyone stopped watching it at once.",

Same 2-3 running jokes on divorce and bankruptcy which just got stale. \n\nGuests also started having their boundaries set so there wasn\u2019t going to be much banter.",

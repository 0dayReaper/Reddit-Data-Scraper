India vs Kian, Battle of the World's Strongest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izLxizQ1Wvw)\n\nI cannot believe Dex is joining Adventure by Accident!! This is a combination I never expected but probably subconsciously deeply wished and wanted. I'll miss Sieon but I am also looking forward to shenanigans with this new set. Maybe I'll get some dumb and dumber moments with these two while Pani is away (he'll be joining after a few days like in s1) LOL. I am so glad filming for season 2 happened so quickly, and I honestly can't wait for June!",

During his episode reviews of the Game of Blood s2, it takes Dex some time to understand the rules lmao I am so looking forward to the crazy antics these two will show us.",

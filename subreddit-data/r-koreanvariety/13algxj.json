I swear the only person making me laugh outside of the HaMin pair consistently is JSJ.\n\n- Dying at SoMin giving Haha the death stare.\n\n- a home alone theme would have been the funniest, tbh \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

But without any rhyme or reason, SBS aired the talk between the two leaders. People (korean) literally flabbergasted and complained about this at RM DC Gallery. There was no announcement whether the show will air or cancel. RM only started to air at 6.40pm, 20 minutes later than normal. Which explain why the rating suddenly drop. People thought the show yesterday was cancelled.\n\nEdit: little correction\nI knew this because I literally wait for 6.20pm to watch RM only to see the special broadcast. I went to SBS website and from the schedule, RM should air like normal. I went to DC Gallery, Korean viewers were equally confused there. I went to Naver news, an article was up and said RM was cancelled (though this article was taken down shortly after that). I went again to SBS website and RM still schedule to air like usual. I was hopeful since there was no cancellation announcement but also afraid as the live broadcast still hadn't end when it was already 6.35pm.",

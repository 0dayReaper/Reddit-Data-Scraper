It's kind of a question and a search for recommandation, but as a mostly gg stan, I only hear of korean shows with girl group members, and I was curious if there is any with male cast ? I'm not talking random apparence like in running man or so, but a real cast like girl high school mystery, earth arcade, hyemileeyechaepa,... \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Yeah, there are. My first recommendation would be \"New Journey To The West\". It's basically the original \"Earth Arcade\" with the same PD, mostly the format, mostly the same games.  \nAnd for a more recent one I liked for example \"No Math School Trip\"",

Best I can recommend is Youtube shows like Game Caterers, which I'm pretty sure Seventeen was just on",

            "comment": "You don't get shows like that with a variety of male idols. The closest thing are shows that are created specifically for that group but even then they feel more like promotional material than a proper variety show. You get something close to it when you get male idols invited to traveling/field trip shows with a variety of other entertainers ranging from actors to comedians to hosts. The reasons vary depending on who you ask but for the majority, I'd reckon the reason they don't really exist is because there's not enough of a demand and it's harder to implement. The culture around male idols and female idols are very different after all, and is why there are known generalizations around them. Things such as male idols tending to have more female fans altho there are exceptions and the general sentiment shifts depending on trends, difference between having a more dedicated fandom who focuses on sales and records vs more recognition from the general public resulting in better digital sales, and the type of content that they can are are expected to produce, etc.",

You can also look up for 2 days 1 night if you're specifically looking for this kind of show with male cast.\n\nAs for idol male cast, I would recommend Going seventeen. They did various stuff actually, and it's pretty fun. The most similar one I guess when they did the remake of old korean entertainment shows, such as Tribal games, Let's go seventeen, and Boo past life.",

Not really a game show but if you were looking for more current idol appearance in variety. \n\nIf you enjoy Na PD\u2019s style like Earth Arcade, you could google na pd and all of the shows he did. A lot of male actors.",

Not just the fans speculating, those words come from a pd. That\u2019s how people started talking about it \n\nA lot of PDs left tvN around that time &amp; all went to JTBC making headlines in the news, including Amazing Saturday pd Lee Tae Gyoung and kim min seok. \n\nQuite a number of shows since then seems to be changing pd at 3 year point.",

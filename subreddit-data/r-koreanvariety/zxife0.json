**Anaconda** revitalized and revamped down the road? Lots of questions still need to be answered regarding the \"suspension\"!&lt;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!Actionista v. Giants in the first Knock-out round match, not sure why they showed the score of 3-3, at least we know the offense of both teams will be showcased!&lt;",

            "comment": "Oh man, I feel so bad for coach Ha, that first half must have cut his life short by at least 5 years due to stress &gt;! of his WW team not finishing so many simple chances and then concede a goal from before the halfway line (had a sneaky curve though, can't totally fault Yoni P there). Can't do much more than that as a coach, was spot on with his tactics and GaYoung was on fire!!&lt;\n\nFor us viewers back home and myself as a fan rooting for Anaconda this too was heart attack inducing. Both teams had such a leaky defense while playing a high line which lead to very open play and favored &gt;!Wonder Woman alot, because they needed to score 2. I feel like coach JJJ got outfoxed by the Godfather. They both have similar playstyles but Anaconda lost in energy, focus and simply got overrun the whole match. The Ace matchup between GaYoung vs TaeJin was a landslide win for GaYoung. I expected/hoped for TaeJin to develop into exactly that kind of player with good vision and shot after dribbling past 1-2 players but alas...!&lt;",

One thing you can see was that there was more trust between WW players.  HongJa played with aggression and finally got a goal for the ages.  Amy came up big for a bench player, her intelligence to move out of HongJa's way for the third score was impressive!&lt;",

            "comment": "I love this show but it's killing me with my favorite players \"leaving\". First was Song Sohee and now Yoon Taejin. All I can say is there better be a twist. The eliminated team better not just be missing from the show for the entire next season and effectively fired (not paid) until the following season when they are reactivated and asked to come back. If that's the case, not only will it suck to not see them all of next season but I think it's unlikely all the members will be free and willing to come back. The show will likely lose at least one member because they have a scheduling conflict or no longer want to play soccer on the show. With Taejin already revealing she wanted to quit a bunch of times and even told them she was going to quit, it's easy to imagine her quitting now that they have been eliminated. If I'm not mistaken two of the most popular players in Korea were Sohee and Taejin. Now with Taejin out and maybe even quitting... that's a blow to the program. \n\nSo here's hoping they get a spin-off or YouTube series or something. I would kill for the \"eliminated\" team to get a spin-off show (TV or YouTube) in which they get individual and team training and do things like go to a soccer academy and do a soccer boot-camp. The eliminated team each season should be an indicator the last thing they need is a long break off the show and for their training and playing time to decrease, maybe entirely. No, they need more training than ever so when they come back they are improved and less likely to be eliminated again. It makes no sense for them to be suspended, not develop much during the time off, come back and then be lagging even more behind everyone so they just get suspended again. Players aren't gonna want to stick around for all that losing and embarrassment. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Anaconda being out isn't just a loss of Taejin for me and the show, but that team is improving and has been part of some really high quality matches this season. Losing Anaconda and the likelihood that their development is stunted while everyone else develops more, not to mention the possibility they lose players while suspended, and the show might be less for not having them not just next season but when they get them back the damage might have been done due to their clear lack of development while suspended. One of the members said at the end of the episode \"I can't believe my schedule tomorrow doesn't have soccer practice in it\" and with that I take it as confirmed that they will likely be truly suspended and any soccer practice and games they play will be entirely on their own. I just don't buy many if any of the members spending their own time and money on improving for the season after next. \n\nStill, I pray for a twist. Let the final episode of the season include scenes where Anaconda members are informed that they will be trained or have a spin-off or something.",

            "comment": "Wow, the set play for the first goal of the game was a beauty. The physicality in this game is intense and by and far the best of the entire series, I'm loving it! The player man-marking Taejin, I believe it's Hong Ja... talk about being physical with her assignment. Taejin is getting man-handled. \n\n  \nAmy is improving quickly and it's so cool to see. I predicted it, seeing as she played well in her first game and she is a dancer. Fine and gross motor control are obviously used entirely when dancing which when added to someone being athletic, as Amy appears to be, the result can be great. That jump kick when the ball was almost out of bounds isn't something just anyone can do, especially with so little soccer experience. She's already paying dividends being on the team coming off the bench but give her another season to develop and she could help WW become a legit threat for the Super League and its championship. I feel the same way, by the way, about Kang Soyeon of Fire Moth. She's a legit athlete and experienced sports player who in her first game already looked pretty good. Give her time to develop too and she'll be damn good. YoonJu is improving too after being moved from goalie. I want her to continue to develop but being eliminated could really stunt her development. \n\n  \nDang, Si Eun was playing with a stress fracture? Just goes to show you never know what they are playing will ailment wise as to why their play in some game, games or season might be worse than you expected. Yoon Ju with the great mid field shot on target for the goal. That skillset is so valuable with the goalies play being what it is on this show. It can often lead to goals, just like that.",

Yes, a few times of bunching up, but that is bound to happen as they were trying to build up a play. Last week was pure season 1 skill and \"zombie soccer\" by two supposedly veteran teams.\n\nThis game show how a team should utilize what it is good at, and how physicality/fitness, speed and skills are needed to make a competitive team that can possibly pull an exciting game. We can see clearly see both teams were doing their best and what they need to do to get ready for next (or next next) season.\n\nI am in a mourning mode for a hump day. Not a good combination :)",

She's giving me Lee Hyun-yi/Jeong He-In vibes, someone who's shown the best season to season improvement among every one.All in all, I don't mind not seeing FC Anaconda for an entire season, and I also wouldn't mind if they overhaul the entire team and bring in new players. I just hope they keep Yoon-Ju and Haley.  \n\n\nEdit: The long time fan in me wants Hyun-Yi to finally lift that trophy, but it's hard to bet against FC Top Girl.

Yoonju have been improving as a forward especially with her shooting and hold up play. Hyeri have been progressing, with more exposure she would be better defender/midfield, and Taejin are needed for them as she is the best among all the Anacondas in term of basic. she also work the hardest in term of offense and defence, cover most ground for her team.\n\nfor the other 3 player, i am not shitting on them, but at least two of them need to be change. especially the goalkeeper. between da young and si eun, one of them need to be replace with more athletic player. i know both of them are SBS personnel, and SBS are pushing hard in term of promoting them (especially da young). but one is enough isn't?. there is a need to balance between business and team competitiveness. there is no point for Anaconda to come back, just to be eliminated again.",

At one point Taejin was surrounded by 3 WW players and they were all grabbing her and it was not on just one occasion either, they were doing the same thing throughout the game and she was angry with it but the ref just allowed it to go on. I dont want the other weaker teams to think they can get away with this and introduce it into their future games and just grab hands or jerseys.",

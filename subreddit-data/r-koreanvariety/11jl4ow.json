    "postText": "I\u2019ve been a long time viewer and it seems as though the show has deviated from the main theme of the show. It seems as though we see more of the celebrity than the interactions with their manager. The main cast such as Yeongja still has her manager with her but the recent celebrities who come on have been showing more of their lives and activities to the point that I thought it was Home Alone for a second. Maybe I\u2019m just having recency bias but is anyone else feeling this way about the show?",

I remember Lee Yong-Ja's first manager that appeared on the program talked about people think he has money because he appears on TV and that he suddenly stuck up because he can't meet up with people because schedule.",

I mean, it could help to take off his career as trot singer which also have a low chance to happen. (Better keep going on as manager than doing something that not stable unless he have another income from other job or business to venture other side)",

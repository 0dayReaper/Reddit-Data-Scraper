I think we\u2019ll see a big gap in shows because of this depending on how long it will take to recover, pretty sure HDYP at the minimum will have to take a short break, and for RM and yoo quiz it depends on how much they\u2019ve filmed in advance. Plus whoever he\u2019s been in contact with.",

Filming proceeded without Yoo Jae Suk, but we have not yet decided our plans for future filming.\u201d\n\nI think had his test came back negative, he would still have missed the filming. The RM staff had two days notice (YJS close contact happened on the 11th), so will have to see how well the staff prepared for his absence. \n\nI think when JSM missed an episode due to coming in close contact, her close contact also happened two days before RM filming.\n\n&gt;It was also reported that Jung Joon Ha (\u201cHow Do You Play?\u201d) and Jo Se Ho (\u201cYou Quiz on the Block\u201d) had tested negative, while HaHa (\u201cRunning Man,\u201d \u201cHow Do You Play?\u201d) and Mijoo (\u201cHow Do You Play?\u201d) were waiting for their results, which will be out tomorrow.\n\nThe article didn't say anything about Haha missing RM filming, but the HDYP members all got tested following YJS' positive testing?",

Often times COVID lie dormant and many people may not know they have it at all. What a person has to do in this situation I have no idea. I think the hardest part will be staying away from his family whom he loves dearly.",

Not even any seating? The whole concept of the show is to skip each other but there's not even a designated waiting room when that happens? It's almost like they were punished for skipping.\n\nThe male model has a nice scratchy voice. \n\nOooohhh nooooo show host and dentist liked each other but his asking her that q made her think he wanted to talk to someone else! This is why you shouldn't bring up other people on dates!\n\nWow none of the 2 rooms who skipped even got to talk to other people. \n\nI wish show host and dentist got a chance to talk again. \n\nLmao department store guy yielded his bed to a tiny dog \ud83d\ude02\n\nAhhh next ep looks good!",

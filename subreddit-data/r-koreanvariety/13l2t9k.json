            "comment": "This might be a bit problematic for Knucks. Comments were on for the first hour or so and people were ripping on him hard for the reviews because of some of the comments he made. For example:\n\n* He mentioned that he wanted to punch the HJH and the villa team in the face for ripping up the tents, chairs, etc.\n* Not using honorifics when talking about HJH.\n* Talking about how he should've pushed Jin Hyeong so that he'd also fracture his foot and not go out searching for cards.\n* His explanation for shoulder checking Hyunji wasn't really an explanation but that he also got elbowed by Hyunji afterwards.\n\nAll of these were said in a joking manner but I think it rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. \n\nMind you, none of the viewer comments were threatening or terrible name calling. Just that \\~80% of the comments were calling him \"not gentleman-like\"/\"beta male\" (rough translation). I guess for Xitsuh, he probably felt awkward about keeping comments on that was so negative of Knucks so that he just turned it off completely.\n\nPeople are also contrasting that with Ha Seung Jin just completely owning it and going to a Physiognomy session with Dex, leaning into what he said.",

Knucks said he was able to say Jinhyeong, what are you doing when, Jinhyeong wasn\u2019t able to complete the road to make 100",

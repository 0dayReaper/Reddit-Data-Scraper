    "postText": "# Season 2 of Eden : Descendants of Instinct\n\n[Corrected Synopsis] \n\n&gt; Passions dribbled over and faux couples were formed by the PD Team in the hillside EDEN house in season one: \u201cEDEN, Descendants of Instinct.\u201d But now the ham-fisted scripting will be turned up yet another notch as a new set of male and female singletons heads to the EDEN house \u2013 in search of product placement ad revenue. In EDEN, plausibility and common sense are done away with: Contestants read cheesy lines which no one believes to each other informally and without the honorifics usually used in everyday Korean language. The amount of information they allegedly learn about one another is not really limited, meaning that hierarchies still form easily here!\n\n&gt; While the first season saw the contestants having fun in the sun, the second season promises a new range of flaccid games and activities \u2013 whose outcomes are more predetermined than the first season. Three celebrity guides \u2013 [Lee Hong Ki](https://www.instagram.com/skullhong12/), [Yoon Bomi](http://instagram.com/__yoonbomi__), and [Simeez](https://www.instagram.com/_simeez/) \u2013 are on hand to watch events unfurl at the EDEN house and provide their commentary while attempting to keep a straight face. With the romantic vibe turned all the way up to 0.5 (out of 100), will our hosts be able to hold onto their self respect...as the contestants\u2019 hunt for the PD Team's sense of shame intensifies?\n\n\n# Panel\n\n- Lee Hong Gi (FT Island) [skullhong12](https://www.instagram.com/skullhong12/)\n- Yoon Bomi (A-Pink) [\\_\\_yoonbomi\\_\\_](http://instagram.com/__yoonbomi__)\n- Simeez (SWF) [_simeez](https://www.instagram.com/_simeez/)\n- Seon Ji Hyun (Eden S1) [ooooog0](https://www.instagram.com/ooooog0) - Guest panel in Ep. 3.\n- Kim Chul Min (Eden S1) [maisonchul](https://www.instagram.com/maisonchul/) - Guest panel in Ep. 4.\n\n# Cast\n\n## Men\n\n- Jo Egeon [j0ysky](https://www.instagram.com/j0ysky/) - 31 y.o., Acting tutor/instructor\n- Kim Dohyun [1031daily](https://www.instagram.com/1031daily/) - 34 y.o., Make-up artist, Race car driver (hobby)\n- Kim Soomin [ssuuuuumin_](https://www.instagram.com/ssuuuuumin_/) - 34 y.o., Restaurant CEO, Poli-Sci Sungkyunkwan University (class of 2015)\n- Kim Kangrae [kang\\_rae\\_kim](https://www.instagram.com/kang_rae_kim/) - 25 y.o.

I also realized that he got really angry at Chaehee for not pairing him and Lana but did not seem to be as mad towards Dohyun when he made the exact same thing, which it already speaks for itself. \n\nAs the show is obviously incredibly scripted, I don\u2019t even know for sure if Soomin is really a red flag or if the show told him to act in certain ways to push the narrative of the \u201cpoor guy that gets rejected by the \u201ccold-hearted girl\u201d all the time but that in the end ends up opening her heart due to his diligence\u201d.\n\nAnyway, the PDs are trash for not letting them choose, not even in the ending, who they truly wanted to be with. I hope that this show ends here and doesn\u2019t have the chance to make another season as it seems to be mentally tiring for the participants as explained by Egeon and other participants from s1.",

Soomin doesn\u2019t deserve hate either because that may not be his real personality and just what they want him to be. Overall i like the people in the show, but not the fakeness of the show",

There are 2 ppl who are insanely more attractive than the rest which makes everything feel off and the majority of the cast would go for that one hot person who is def not gonna choose them! If they did the casting right there tbh wouldn't be a need to script the show lol",

            "comment": "**SPOILERS for Eden 2 and Singles Inferno 2 in this post**:\n\nThis show was full of twists and turns but it frustrated tf out of me!!!! \n\nI couldn't stand Soomin and Chae Hee. King and Queen of Desperation! How many times do they have to get rejected on national TV to get it in their heads? I was cringing the entire time they were on screen. \n\nSoomin was toxic AF. He creeped me out from start to finish. The way he looked at Lana, lusted after her, desperately asked everyone in power to put him in the same bedroom as her... EW!!! \n\n I don't understand the panel members calling what he had for Lana \"true love\" when the guy literally saw her, fell for her looks, and wanted to claim her as if she was a prize to be won? He barely talked to her and not to mention THEY ONLY FILMED FOR 6 DAYS and suddenly after 1 day, he was \"madly in love\" with her and that's PURE LOVE? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Okay yeah, suuuure! \n\nHe acted like such a child when he didn't get what he wanted (alone time with Lana), threw tantrums and cried. For a 34 yr old business owner... That's def not a good look. I felt so grossed out seeing his annoying facial expressions. DUDE, SHE IS NOT ATTRACTED TO YOU. Drill that in your head and move tf on. \n\nI hate the trope in these reality shows and dramas that if you're persistent enough, the girl will end up falling for you. Just stick to her from day 1, don't be scared to be desperate af and you'll eventually get your way. All your desperate efforts will be worth it in the end. They perpetuate that in almost EVERY reality show. \n\nTake Singles Inferno 2 for example. JW saw SK, fell for her looks, didn't give ANY other girl a chance, stuck to her despite all the rejections and managed to win her heart?? Why can't these people accept rejection gracefully? \n\nAnd notice how it's always the men that persist that \"win the heart\" of the woman in the end, but the same can't be said for the women who pine after men they're interested in? \n\nIn Eden 2, CH had absolutely no self respect, throwing herself at Yigun after he rejected her in so many different ways (after the first time, I wouldn't bother being nice. I'd straight up tell her \"I'm not attracted to you. Leave me tf alone\"). In the end, she kept getting broken down and rejected. Same with So-e from Singles Inferno 2. She was obsessed with Yoonjae and only had eyes for him but spent the first half of the show getting rejected by him and pitied by the rest of the cast. Food for thought. \n\nAnd lastly, I am SO GLAD Seo-Ah called out Do-Hyun for kissing her without consent in the car. I can see how he thought that would be cute - but dude, you're not a couple yet... she's NEVER given you consent to move past holding hands. How are you going to kiss her while she's sleeping? A chill ran down my back watching his satisfied smile after he kissed her and felt creeped out by him for the rest of the show. \n\nJust needed to rant about these 3. I'm done lol.",

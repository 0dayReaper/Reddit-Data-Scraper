    "postText": "Loved watching Time Hotel and Bloody Game 2 but I don't speak Korean and am not super plugged in to the scene. Is there anything else coming down the pipe? Is Bloody game 1 worth going back to (seemed like consensus was that it wasn't very good). Obviously seen the classics like Genius, Great Escape, Crime Scene. I haven't seen busted, I started it but the first episode was a little weird, it felt scripted but maybe I just didn't understand it. I guess this is a recommendation thread but also curious what's coming up that we know about.",

            "comment": "I just finished Siren Survive the Island on Netflix and that was a lot of fun. It\u2019s a capture the flag/base type game but it\u2019s run over a whole week, and features exclusively bad ass women. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen it, Physical 100 on Netflix was a lot of fun. Basically like if you took all the physical challenges from Survivor and turned it up to 11. But the casting really makes it imo\n\nWe are also due for Zombieverse, also on Netflix, sometime in 3rd quarter this year. Apparently they are put in a zombie apocalypse simulation and have to figure stuff out. It has some pretty big names like Noh Hong Chul and Park Na Rae.\n\nNetflix seems to be making a big push for SK reality/variety show programming so hopefully we\u2019ll be getting even more cool stuff soon",

Also Society Game in case you haven\u2019t already seen that.",

As for BG1 I\u2019ve only seen up to the first elimination and haven\u2019t gone back to it, but will try to soon. Not sure if you\u2019d like[\u201cNew World\u201d](https://youtu.be/utXD927ENqw) (Netflix). Recently, I enjoyed \u201c[Siren Survive the Island](https://youtu.be/F8xTxijPFxY)\u201d (Netflix).\n\nThere\u2019s a Japanese survival show Choi Min Ho participated in called \u201c[Run for the Money](https://youtu.be/-IYzF8Tii8s)\u201d (Netflix). It was a bit scary at times (at least for me, too many people in suits!) but also hilarious.\n\nUpcoming Korean survival shows: there\u2019s \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Plan\u201d, and \u201cZombieverse\u201d on Netflix, saved it in my list a few weeks ago but not sure when it\u2019ll be released. Says 2023 in the description though so probably soon. \n\n(Included links to trailers per title, when available)",

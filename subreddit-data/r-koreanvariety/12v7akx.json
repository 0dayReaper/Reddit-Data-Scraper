I was so engrossed with the story of the sanctuary and the work that it was about 45 min in to their separation when I realized we hadn't cut away to the other group. It was great to see them go from being afraid of the horses to comfortably petting and engaging with them.",

I remember on Sixth Sense they had the dating episode and the lady setting up couples was hyping up the guy like he can make a few million in a few years time. And YJS was like are you looking down on Mijoo she can do the same.",

Cast members can give opinion and feedback of shows but seldom it is decided by YJS. \n\nCreating a show and episode concept is not the job of a cast member.  It takes month long planning and concept. Especially for real variety shows where letting the member experience something for the first time, concealing the show's concept is important. \n\nYou can watch interviews of PDs in SK like Na Yeon Seuk of 2D1N, 3 Meals a Day, Kim Tae Oh of IC, RM PDs over the years (recently they went on KJK youtube to share their experience).\n\nEspecially in this forum, you are going to find avid K-variety watchers for decades. The role of PD is undeniable especially so for Real Variety format like IC, HDYP, 2D1N.",

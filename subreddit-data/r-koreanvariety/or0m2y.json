    "postText": "On July 24th, the media reports revealed that the comedian has filed a civil lawsuit against his brother and sister-in-law back on June 22nd. Initially, he sued for 8.6 billion KRW (about $7.4 million USD) but later on July 16th, his legal representative increased the damage amount to 11.6 billion KRW(about $10 million USD) along with a claim amendment. \nPark Soo Hong's lawyer commented, \"While investigating the case, we've found additional damages so we have added the damage by expanding the complaint's coverage.\"  \nPark Soo Hong petitioned for a cease and desist order for selling real estate properties on June 28th and the court approved the petition. On July 19th, the court forfeited the right to sell all real estate properties under Park Soo Hong's brother and sister-in-law's names based on his petition.   \n\nMeanwhile, Park Soo Hong has sued his brother and sister-in-law for embezzlement. \n\nLink to the article https://www.allkpop.com/article/2021/07/comedian-park-soo-hong-sues-his-brother-and-sister-in-law-for-116-billion-krw",

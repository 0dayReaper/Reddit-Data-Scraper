She called everyone sunbeanim, except SoMin (immediately called her unnie) and lots of cute skinship moments. Not in a creepy way, but I did notice them (\"feel my heart beat\" and then hugging in the back after doing the Zombie moves, etc) which just shows they're pretty comfortable quickly despite the age difference. \n\nI must say, I find Haha super attractive. Like I know they make fun of each other's looks for the hell of it, but I genuinely think he is the second most attractive member on this line up. (First being JSM for me, so Haha is the most handsome dude\ud83d\ude0e) He also has this really attractive swag about him that shows up when he dances. Not to mention his deep low voice. I have a massive crush on this man. Just thought I bring it up cause I don't see it be talked about nearly enough. \n\nAlso, lost it at Sukjin calling JaeSuk \"Ja Suk\" \ud83d\ude02, and their effing drawings. With the exception of Jongkook and SoMin (and Haha to some extent) the others were straight up embarassing and hilarious. KJK captured the essence of YSC in his drawing so well, but the protruding mouth brothers were killing me the entire time with the monstrosities they were creating.\n\n\nI liked that they included a spy mission in the mix. \n\n&gt;Spoilers here:\n\n\nAlso, not only SoMin and YeEun look alike and have the same vibes, they chose each others' charms by mistake (so did everyone else about the two of them). Isn't this just a sign to become best friends at this point? \ud83d\ude01",

Her clips got viewed 50k+ views while JSJ singing freakin Filipino song got around 40k views. People cheered her the loudest. From what i see on twitter and IG, she got the most fan booths, fan gifts, fan shirts, fan banners etc. Even the cringy spartace got their own fan gifts and banners. \n\nIf you say she is bad in RM, I agree.

It's the same sht with idols. Once in a blue moon, a YJS appears that manages to do the seemingly impossible. \n\nI remember following some Twitter accounts for a Kpop competition and they were outraged when a girl group was eliminated because none of the girls were \"Korean beauty standard\" attractive - but they were the best singers. And mediocre and sometimes horrible singers made it through because they had the look. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nWhat's funny is that I don't even get all the look talk about SJH. \ud83d\ude01 There must be something wrong with my eyes or judgment, because I would never pick her out of a line up of some other Korean actresses as even top 5 most beautiful. Definitely not in recent years, anyways. But that's totally subjective and not at all important here. \n\nYeah, basically, I'm very annoyed that someone who contributes the least is appreciated and celebrated the most. \n\nI get why she is so terrified of losing her fans. (By not speaking up against the bullying and harrassment they were inflicting on other RM members and guests at times!), And even going as far as hiding follow lists so they're not easily traced back to her, and doing things to make them happy (fan service) even if it's at the expense of making others uncomfortable (poor KJK during the fanmeeting). They're basically supporting her life at this point, so of course she's not gonna say no to her fans, and they are collectively her manager. \ud83d\ude01 \n\n...I'm ranting again.",

Whatever I've said about the show and the cast, I've tried to keep their performance separate from the person. It's not the person I'm criticizing, it's the performance.

Like you just said in other comments that JSM is prettier than SJH. And that you said you posted a photo of JSM and asked people how she looks. So, beauty seems to be one of your priority too. \n\nNothing wrong with your judgement about beauty. You can say SJH is ugly because it is subjective. Just for me, she is still the prettiest and SJH is far from being my fav member.\n\nAbout the fanwar and hate JSM getting. Hard to put all of the blame on SJH. Its her fans. You cant control it if its as big as her fandom. Did Blackpink members put out a clear statement for the hate Lisa's getting from other members fan. JSJ didnt post comment on his IG after YJS and KJK getting the hate for one controversial episode before. When KJK and SJH were literally kick out unnoticed from RM before, not one member give out any statement addressing it or scolding SBS for the unethical firing procedure. That incident affect SJH very deeply yet YJS never mention it publicly never blame SBS for once because they probably talked about it bts and KJK SJH were ok with it. \n\nIn SJH-JSM case, If a statement can solve all the bullying, then why YJS not even once mention SJH-JSM situation. YJS and other member addressed it in a diff way. YJS takes JSM to join his show that made JSM a big name now. Other members treats her well on shows and give her more attention. \n\nAnd SJH also do the same. She is the sweetest to JSM on the show, hug her, praise her, care for her etc (at least this is what i see as a casual fan of them, you will see it differently if you hate SJH) so that her fans can see that she has no problem with JSM. There's is no action by SJH that shows she hates JSM.\n\nDid you see JSJ giving a ride to SJH in JSJ world. The only name in her mind was JSM. Keep on bringing JSM into their conversation even when JSJ try to move on to other topic. If her fans dont see how in love SJH is with JSM on the show, what makes you think they will change for one statement. And who knows they probably talk about this bts and YJS telling them to better ignore them and dont give any controveraial statement.",

I posted a screenshot to ask people how OLD do the they think she looks. That was entirely because I introduced a couple of friends to the show and they wouldn't believe she was in her 30s, and I also think she looks very young, so I just thought it was interesting that we were so off. I wanted to see how other random people saw it. \n\n- I have never said SJH is ugly. In fact, I've said the exact opposite several times. Feel free to go through my comments if you don't believe me! I simply don't find her attractive, because I feel that she has a very normal and ordinary look. Nothing about her stands out to me. That doesn't mean she's ugly. \n\n- About the blame on SJH: she doesn't deserve all the blame, but she most definitely deserves some of it. She has never posted a picture with JSM, ever. After episode 587 when YSC brought up personal stuff in a game and got a lot of criticism, JSM immediately posted a picture of the two of them and that calmed a lot of people down. Because it showed that they were on good terms. She always posts solo pictures of her outfits. This was clearly done so with the intention to help YSC out. Other celebrities have asked their fans to not attack and harrass co-workers: Jessi did this in a live right after finding out she was let go from Showterview and replaced by Sunmi. Heck, even big names in the US have done this. Didn't Selena Gomez just go through this with Hayley or someone else? \n\n- You cannot compare this to SBS firing the two. And you're mistaken there! The cast did react: they said they would all leave, and end the show. \n\n- why do you keep blaming YJS? He doesn't have to do anything. He isn't involved in this. I do think he could have handled it better, but as a third party in all of this I have a hard time being dissapointed in him as it really isn't his fault or his place. \n\n- You thinn SJH treats JSM that well? Hug her? \ud83d\ude01 Of course you'll use the \"if you don't see it you're a hater\" thing to disarm me! I never said SJH hates JSM. They are very obviously just not close at all. If you can't see that, then you're kidding yourself. Even YJS has said it on the show. Do you want me to give you examples of SJH mistreating or not taking care of JSM, btw? Mentioning her twice on JSJ's show doesn't mean they're BFFs. Let's see... \n\n1. She saved JSM's number under \"JSM yang\". According to FluentU, \n\n&gt; \uad70 (goon) : This honorific is used for young, unmarried males in a formal occasion. \n&gt; \uc591 (yang) : This is the same as \uad70, but for young and unmarried females\n\n&gt; **It is better to not use this one in everyday conversation as it can be seen as condescending since it may suggest submissiveness or certain gender roles.** \n\n\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f YJS and KJK were the ones who said that sounded so cold, too. She saved YSC's number under \"SeChani\". Doesn't that scream to you that she favors one maknae to the other? \ud83d\ude01 \n\n2. Episode 566, after the slime disaster, they do a rock paper scissors to determine the loser and SJH loses. It's not exactly on camera, but what she says is picked up by the mics and translated as well. She tells JSM to not talk to her! In front of everyone... \"Don't talk to me\" in an annoyed tone. \n\n3. Episode 599, after JSM spends her own money on the massage place and gets more people into trouble for the penalty she gets scolded by the others. Everyone stops their nagging after one or two sentences, but SJH keeps on going and raising her voice so much she's straight up yelling at JSM. You can clearly see JSM on the verge of tearing up! Imagine getting yelled at badly by someone in front of cameras! Even YSC who started the nagging notices JSM getting ready and immediately jumps in with \"I know why you did it, it's ok\". \n\nNone of this means SJH hates JSM. I'm just trying to give examples of why I think your statement that SJH treats JSM well and take care of her well is not true. Sure, there are also moments that she does take care of her: In episode 591, when JSM has hurt her foot and is in a cast - SJH is extra nice to her and does seem to be taking care of her. I'm not trying to say she treats SoMin badly or hates her. I'm trying to say: they're obviously not close and that is completely fine. Their relationship isn't supportive sisters or enemies. It's somewhere in the middle. Like most relationships. I just dislike it when people act like \"MongDol\" sisters are the best thing ever. For the majority of the episodes, they barely even interact. \n\n- Lastly, JSJ was never trying to move on to other topics when SJH mentioned JSM. \ud83d\ude01 You're seeing things. \n\n\nTo wrap up: yes! I know I sound like a hater, and it does look psychotic to write an essay on this. But I genuinely love this show and the members (most of them) and I love JSM so much I want her to have a big sister on the show. Trust me, I notice the good parts as well (fixing the beanie, getting angry at JSJ for hitting JSM too hard) but I don't think those are enough. I see more coldness than warmth. It doesn't mean I think they hate eachother. It means I think the older one hasn't allowed the younger one to get close to her. For whatever reason. Maybe they're too different. Maybe it's an age difference issue. (Which I think is ridiculous, but it is Korea) Maybe it's a generational difference (Xennial vs Millennial). Maybe it has no reason! They just don't click. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nBTW, SJH is like this with most people.  She let her stylist take the blame for her short haircut for months and months before she confessed on a YouTube show that it was her who did it in a drunken state. Her stylist was getting harassed and bullied online to the point where her agency sued her own fans and YJS even talked about this on the show! Yet, SJH kept quiet and didn't even stand up for the stylist and didn't take responsibility for it until months later. Two episodes ago, JSM and SJH didn't wash the clams because SJH said they don't need to. Guess who took the blame for sand in the clams? JSM. Guess who stayed silent and didn't stand up for JSM? SJH. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI'm done here. I've said whatever I wanted to say and more. This isn't healthy nor is it productive. But at least, once and for all, I put it all together. So thank you. It was sort of cathartic.",

I was honestly disappointed in her when I watched that youtube show. Especially considering she seemed like one of those celebrities who is besties with their staff (based on clips), like having no other social circle, so why not stand up for them? \n\nBut yeah I reviewed the example episode moments you gave, and they're a bit of a stretch. Episode 599 Ji Hyo is the last member to join in on the scolding, but JSJ is the one who speaks the most &amp; has the last word. 4 minutes after that scene you can see Somin hugging Ji Hyo's arm as they listen to the penalty instructions and kinda hiding behind her. Ep 566 is such a small moment so I had a hard time finding it. Honestly, the camera frame is zoomed in on SJH only, so we can't really see who she is directing the comment toward or how others reacted since it's such a tiny moment. \n\nThe problem with their dynamic, I think, is that SJH is used to having little brother vibes with younger members (see early days SJK &amp; LKS). So Sechan has been filling up that role well for her to play off of: he treats her well &amp; has fun spending time with her so she doesn't feel excluded. He also teases her so that can do her \"angry Jihyo\" character in retribution. \n\nWith Somin, when Jihyo does that \"angry character\" it doesn't play off well bc they don't show that playful closeness at other times that will make viewers feel reassured that it's all fun and games. RM cast as a whole relies on \"angry old male conservative\" characters for comedy. Very masculine leaning in general and SJH learned variety through all of their examples, so its understandable that this is how she attempts to relate with Somin. They just need to find other ways to relate to each other on the show. And it's not like Somin has the inability to get along with other women, we've seen how amazing &amp; funny she was on Sixth Sense. A lot of that show felt refreshing bc the members weren't bashed every 5 seconds for being non-stereotypical women. If RM cast as a whole shifted their misogynistic tendencies, I think it would help SJH &amp; JSM develop new &amp; interesting dynamics. YJS has already been seen changing this way: he notices SJH more &amp; shines the spotlight on her quirks &amp; antics. I think it'll keep improving as the rest of the cast follow his lead.",

I really really do see all the good as well, especially being a huge JSM fan. I love those little moments between her and SJH, and I desperately want more. In fact, I eagerly watch new episodes hoping to see that one scene that would melt my heart like the beanie thing or SoMin calling JiHyo in a shaky timid voice after messing up the slime. Which reminds me, about this: I'm not saying SJH had no right to get angry. SoMin messed up and she knew she was gonna get scolded and she deserved it too and it was still a very cute moment! I just didn't like that she got angry because she came in last after the rock paper scissors. She should have just accepted the loss, she had already given SoMin a talking to. Btw, the exact timestamp is (episode 566) 1:00:38 when they play rock paper scissors and 1:00:41 when SJH tells her \"don't talk to me\". I agree, you can't see who she's saying that to Because it's only her on screen but for some reason (a split second head tilt towards JSM?) made me think it was her. Didn't help it that for the remainder of the episode, the two of them didn't interact at all. \ud83d\ude01 \n\nBut honestly, this isn't even a big deal. Who hasn't had stupid arguments with friends and acquaintances? SJH is still a few years older and a Senior colleague both on variety and acting and modeling to SoMin. That might not mean anything most other places, but it does mean a lot in South Korea. It means: if unnie is mad, you keep your distance and better be on your best behavior. \ud83d\ude01 which is cute tbh.",

You also acknowledged in the reply that you sound like a hater. You've said before that you dont want to engage with any SJH related comment but you just cant hold yourself right. Maybe you're too excited when someone discrediting SJH or irritated when someone praising her. I've seen you on SJH's-only post and you just need to be there calling her cringe and old.\n\nYou said people were telling you JSM looks young and used that argument before to prove that JSM has a beautiful visual too. Just prove that you really do care about her visual and trying to get people to appreciate her visual too. I'm bringing that up because how irritated you are when people bring up sjh visual and saying the world is not fair for looking too much at someone's visual when you pretty much did the same. And i'm not saying, you think sjh ugly, I said, you can say that and it will not be a problem to me because beauty is subjective.\n\nFor the case of ysc, the hate ysc got was pretty much triggered by her reaction. She agreed to open to any insult from ysc but she literally about to cry when ysc mentioned her ex. If she really hurt by that comment, she would ask the PD to edit it out. But she allow the PD to broadcast it and ysc got the hate because she almost cried. She probably thought her action was the reason why ysc got hate and post something to fix that. She was great for that. Jessi also falls into same category too. She's the first one posting a comment saying Sunmi replaced her and that she didnt get any notification. She worded it wrongly and not explaining that this has nothing to do with Sunmi but SBS. So her fans misinterpreted it as Jessi feeling dissapointed with Sunmi that's why she has to clarify. \n\nNow, which action or words from sjh that says she blame jsm for what happen. Not a single action or word from sjh that can be use to trigger the hate jsm getting. Its her fans creating tension from nothing. Its all because of women vs women sentiment that is so strong in this world. Which is why i brought up the blackpink situation because i think this is more accurate to represent the sjh - jsm fanwar. Lisa and BP members said nothing hateful toward one another yet the fans saying Lisa is selfish doesnt care about other members, Jennie Jisoo hate/ignore Lisa. And in blackpink situation none of them said anything when members and their family getting death threat, rape threat from the solo stans. Because the fans that created the hate are just delusional and crazy that any statement will make them more aggressive with hatred. \n\nI'm not blaming yjs. Its just that if the situation really bothers jsm, yjs as her best friend and a leader should step up. He's the most respected celebrity and if you think a statement can improve anything yjs should be in the front line to do it. But no, yjs said nothing about the fanwar among his castmates instead he took another action which he thinks is the better route. He showed love toward jsm on the show, casted her on other programs with him. Telling the world if you love yjs you need to love jsm too. \n\nAnd like i said sjh also took this route. \"action speaks louder than words\". Sjh shows she has no issue with jsm on the show through their interaction. Just follow mongdol acc on twitter and IG if you want to see their chemistry. How can you watch their interactions and called it mistreatment and sjh doesnt care about jsm (BP situation all over again). What kind of twisted mind is that. \n\nYou want her to be more bold with jsm but the moment she playfully saved her name with weird names you are triggered. Yjs saved jsj as \"weakest of weakest men\"(way more harsh than jsm contact name) and yjs is mistreating jsj now? Yjs saved kjk as \"Kook Jong\", now yjs favors kjk more than jsj? \n\nYou go even further to analyse sjh's tone and gesture just trying too hard to fit your imaginary opinion that sjh doesnt treat jsm well. That is just your biased judgement. I can also use my bias judgement as a jsj fan to think that sjh and jsm were rude to jsj in many occasions. Plus, you know kjk yelled to jsj way more aggressive right. Jsj called jsm stupid and cant read the situation many times. Did jsj really means that. Ofc you will say the situation/tone is different. Many many situations you can twist so that it looks the way you want it to looks if you already fix your belief and narrative. \n\nYou just mention the moments where sjh took care of jsm but still decided to focus on the moments sjh were not doing that? Sjh probably kiss jsm (and it actually happened) and you will say she looks disgusted while doing that. \n\nTo me action tells a lot more. And sjh action toward jsm on the show should be more than enough statement that sjh loves jsm and theres nothing bad between them. If their interaction on RM are not enough, what makes you think a pic or statement on IG will change anything? You and her toxic fans will probably change the narrative again. \"Jsm/PD forced sjh to post this\", \"Sjh statement is half-hearted not sincere\" etc etc. If their interaction on the show is cold the way lks - jsm, then i understand why you need to make a statement. But sjh - jsm are literally sisters on the show no matter how much you deny it.",

You have sixth sense, or I must have said it somewhere and forgotten. I basically don't have anything to say on solo posts of hers (like social media posts and ads) but not posts that involve running man or my favorite members and moments. \n\n&gt; used that argument before to prove that JSM has a beautiful visual too.\n\nIt is the first or second post I ever made on Reddit. You can go and see my history. It was months ago. The post is there, my comments are there - it is simply about what random people who don't consume any Korean media think her age is. Not about beauty or visuals. Having said that, of course I think she is beautiful. In fact, she is amongst the top most beautiful Korean celebrities to me. Maybe even top 3. I don't think it's a secret, and I would never ask random people \"is this woman beautiful?\". \ud83d\ude01 Beauty is in the eye of a beholder. To me, I find the opposite of myself attractive: tall, slender, long arms and legs, brunette, long neck and for face, beautiful but not too perfect - a cute smile, big eyes, small mouth and nose. That is literally Jeon SoMin (and my first top visual of the Korean entertainment world, Kim Minji: https://twitter.com/jiuioops/status/1644903882403856385?s=46&amp;t=5XoE9uISww7lo_biOtsSmA ) \n\n&gt; the hate ysc got was pretty much triggered by her reaction.\n\nNo, just no. There is a line you do not cross and he crossed it and people are allowed to be dissapointed in him for it. I am not saying he deserves hate, but he deserved criticism. Bringing up people's traumatic past experiences and also involving their current job and work is low. Do you know how damaging his comment was to SoMin and her acting career? He asked if she thought of his ex who cheated on her when she was kissing her co-star in her show where she played a mistress and he played the cheater. Relating this to her work hurts her because some people might avoid watching that show now, thinking the actress is doing this for personal reasons! Even worse, he basically insulted her professionalism. You cannot twist this to make it ok to me. She tried several times to steer away from their real lives and bring it back to RM world, but he just had to win. It's a game, it isn't that serious. Everyone knew SoMin was gonna lose the votes anyways just because everyone loves messing with her. He had no reason to go there. It was unfunny, hurtful, immature and deserved criticism. It had nothing to do with her reaction, and everything to do with him making a mistake. \n\n&gt; If she really hurt by that comment, she would ask the PD to edit it out.\n\nDo you seriously think she has the power to just ask the PD to not air something? In fact, I'm pretty sure in one of the recent episodes she mentioned she couldn't believe the PDs ended up showing something and not editing it out. This show has writers and producers and editors who have more experience than she does. I'm not even sure YJS has the ability to just go to the PD and say, \"I didn't look good, just edit that out\". \n\n&gt; which action or words from sih that says she blame jsm for what happen.\n\nI'm so confused here. Your entire argument that it is the victim's fault for bringing on hate to themselves is flawed. What action from SJH made people attack SoMin? Her INACTION. That's what. The earliest hate comments were all about screentime and how JSM was stealing SJH's screentime. Why would people feel that way? Well, because SJH was doing very little on the show worthy of screentime (still it was more than she is doing now, back in 2017-18). It was never JSM's fault or JSM's existence that made SJH invisible. It was and is SJH herself. \n\nComparing Kpop idols fans with running man fans is ridiculous. For one thing, Lisa was a teenager when bp debuted, and she is 17 years younger than SJH. When SoMin joined RM, SJH was 37. You are comparing the fans of a 37 year old woman and a 19 year old girl! \n\n&gt; He showed love toward jsm on the show, casted her on other programs with him.\n\nSo, you're saying YJS only asked SoMin on other shows cause he felt bad that she got hate? No. He has said it many times now that he thinks SoMin is one of the best female entertainers and an exceptional variety talent. He wouldn't just accept anyone in his line or take them to his shows. It isn't because he feels sorry for her, it is because he genuinely sees her talent and likes her. There's no alterior motive. \n\n&gt; Sih shows she has no issue with jsm on the show through their interaction.\n\nWhat interaction? \ud83d\ude01 That's literally all I'm saying about MongDol. I do follow MongDol accounts. Poor admins have nothing to post for the most part. It's usually 3-4 seconds clips and in the background for the majority of the times. In fact, go to the RM YouTube channel and see the members chemistry videos. Most are 20 minutes long and have multiple funny and memorable interactions. Sometimes, there are more than 1 video. However, there's only 1 MongDol video and it is barely 10 minutes and it involves 3 scenes in total most of which don't even involve the women. If you take out the actual MongDol moments where the both of them are on the screen at the same time and interacting that whole video will be 3 minutes long, 2 minutes of it will be the one game they played where JSM kissed SJH repeatedly. Do you really think there would be so many haters if SJH actually showed affection and interacted with SoMin? Do you think her fans would hurt someone she treated like a little sister? Someone she had great chemistry with, like LKS? The problem is that there is limited interaction and inaction and disinterest from one party. \n\n&gt; Sjh probably kiss jsm (and it actually happened)\n\nWhen? If you're referring to 552, she didn't. She went for a kiss playfully but it never happened. I don't recall ever seeing her kissing SoMin.",

Go back and see your 1st reply to me. And all im trying to say is that, you also care about visual to the extend you need to ask random people about jsm appearance. You dont care about visual but two of your bias are the most beautiful celebrity in Korea. See how you contradict urself. And it's totally ok to say your bias is the prettiest but you shouldnt get triggered when people say sjh is prettier because you exactly think the same for jsm. \n\nNo. I dont think ysc crossed the line. He's not talking about her ex husband and stuff. It's her ex bf. Jsm brought up about her ex bf the most compared to the other members so calling it a traumatic experience is too far a stretch. If its so traumatic, she would never mention her experience with her ex but its the opposite right. The members were the one asking jsm to stop talking about her ex most of the time. And, guess what, the same ep ysc talk about jsm ex was the same ep the members keeps accusing jsj as a bad husband who yelled at her wife. But no one even care about this when this is far more rude and damaging toward jsj. Imagine jsj cried after being called a bad husband, probably it will make it to the news but jsj just laugh it off and people forget about it. \n\nYes, jsm can ask the PD to edit the scene if she really hurt by the comments. The fact that you think Bopil will not care about jsm's request if she ask for it is an ignorant comment. The fact that they surprised some scene is not edited out is one of the proof that the PD did edited out a lot of uncomfortable scene before. And maybe you forget. They edited out the scene of jsj getting selected as a captain before because members asked for it when jsj was really pissed off he was the target. Yjs even revealed few episodes later that the PD said they can edit out the first vote and redo the vote because jsj wasnt satisfied and it ended with jsj was still selected as the captain in the re-vote. \n\nNo i didnt blame jsm for the hate she gets from sjh's toxic fans. I'm saying we shouldnt put the blame on sjh too. If its entirely because of screen time then yjs and jsj should be the target of the toxic fans because they have the most screen time and often cut sjh when she speaks. The toxic fans not targetting jsm because of screen time, that was all an excuse. Like i said, it's all because women vs women sentiment. Which is why i said doesnt matter how much close sjh is with jsm on the show the toxic fans will never feel enough and will find another way to hate on jsm. \n\nComparing BP with sjh - jsm fanwar is totally relatable, its stem off the same women vs women jealousy. No matter how much jisoo, jennie, rose, Lisa closeness will be enough for the toxic fans. \n\nIn sjh case, she never shows any animosity towards jsm. Its all made up in your imagination. I've already told you how she brought up jsm name many times on Jsj world and called out jsj for not giving jsm a ride. She even said she wants to come back to jsj world together with jsm. Look at sjh interview on Tteokbokki Brothers when the mc ask her about jsm. She clearly said she is grateful having jsm around because she always felt lonely when she was the only female in RM. But still this isnt enough for you and jsm hater right. \n\n Ok then, she tried to kiss jsm so does that tells you she doesnt love jsm because she just trying and not successful. You just love to stray away and look at it differently. How many minutes their chemistry video is more important to you it seems. And what do you mean 'IF sjh showed affection towards jsm'. She did and you just dismissed everything because you dont want it to be true. \n\nOne thing for sure you will never convince me that sjh doesnt love jsm. Sjh and jsm are sisters and not even you can change that. \n\nP/s: Yes you did say you wanted no more engagement under sjh related comment. This was after your comment about sjh got downvoted so bad and you probably dissapointed with the downvote. And yes you did comment sjh is cringe on a solo post about her IG update before. You actually commented on a lot of sjh solo post before, weird that you forget. There were also some nasty comment you said about sjh that later you deleted probably realising how bad it sound.",

I make it clear that I am not saying SJH hates JSM, and you keep insisting that is what I'm saying. I'm saying she is indifferent. There is a difference. And why would I even try to convince you of what you wanna believe? Go ahead and believe whatever you want about this \"sisterhood\". I'm simply pointing out that to me, based on the \"evidence\" I have mentioned like rarely interacting and basically never showing closeness, I think they're not close. \n\nYou said SJH Kissing SoMin has happened before. Yet, you can't give me the episode it happened in. In fact, you're now saying it didn't happen. It was just an attempt and entirely a joke. I don't even think this is something that must happen to prove people's affection. You said it, and I was just curious when it happened because that would be something I would not forget. \n\nGood that you brought up the interview that they asked SJH what she thought of about JSM joining. You really seriously think her answer showed closeness? She could have said anything, and all she could come up with was that she was thankful another woman joined Because that meant she didn't have to be alone getting washed up after the shoot. \ud83d\ude10 She could have said she was thankful for SoMin because of who SoMin is. Not just another female body in the showers after shoot. It's funny how we see these answers completely differently. I truly believe that answer further proves how not close they are. \n\nI won't address you bringing up comments I have deleted. I deleted them for a reason. It's done and over with and no point arguing or defending anything. \"Used\" to comment on SJH posts doesn't mean I do. I used to like her a lot, too. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nLastly, I am so shocked that you actually said this:\n\n&gt; He's not talking about her ex husband and stuff.

Then i said, there was no action or statement from sjh that can cause a reasonable fans to hate jsm. There were sjh - jsm moments that prove this (but you said it isnt enough). You then going on analysing sjh's tone + gesture just to make up your 'sjh-is-not-sweet-to-jsm' agenda. Complaining about how weird sjh saving jsm's contact name but when yjs did the same to jsj's contact name, they are best friends. Like i said, i can also make up my own 'sjh/jsm are rude to jsj' narrative if i just twist my analysis on sjh/jsm tones and gestures.  \n\nYou're also trying to imply that sjh inaction that cause the hate on jsm. And i'm saying no. The women vs women sentiment is the real reason. That's why i pointed out blackpink situation. Sjh is not close with yjs too but her fans dont hate him. \n\nWhich is why in the beginning i said that whether or not sjh post jsm pic or give out a statement regarding the jsm hate, it wont change anything for the toxic fans. I just brought up sjh's statement about how grateful she is having jsm in RM and you just love to dismiss this and focus on \"she just love having a shower-friend\". See how you just prove my point. Sjh might write a thousand of words appreciating jsm and her toxic fans will go \"jsm is forcing her to write this.. etc\". \n\nYou love to analyse the small detail of how indifference sjh is toward jsm. Do you realise LKS is even more cold to jsm compared to sjh before he quits RM. I'm curious do you put LKS situation as \"he doesnt care about jsm\" \"he rarely talk with jsm recently\" the same way you put sjh in.",

Perhaps because I'm getting older myself (and have had my share of slips over the years), just how easily it is to twist or strain in the wrong way prevents me from fully enjoying it any more.!&lt;  \n  \n&gt;!Haha being the spy, and getting caught, is so predictable. Worse because it always plays out relatively the same, right down to the reactions and denials.!&lt;  \n  \n&gt;!Strawberry games have given us some good laughs at times, but it's getting played out now. Time to find something else (and not just another twist). I'm totally on board with repeating games every now and then, but space it out a lot more.!&lt;  \n  \n&gt;!Really like the drawing/memory/guessing game as a premise, but seems to me it's more fun to play than to actually show. With that in mind, I'd rather see it edited to let viewers participate more. Show us less of the drawing process and answers, and more of the gameplay with space to guess before seeing the results. It would be better if we saw everyone's reactions to the drawings at the same time we were having our own. Don't let them watch each other draw either.!&lt;  \n  \nHoping the next week or two will be good. I enjoy watching them prepare and execute performances. Hopefully it's entertaining as always.",

The matching game could have been fun, but between the editing and the restricted feeling it was a bit dull.\n\nThe only thing that caught my interest was the return of the picture game. \n\nMaybe it's just me, but I think the weekend filmings do better now with the new format. They've cut down the filming hours so much that it feels like half of every episode is just them greeting each other again and by the time they're warmed up and ready to actually do anything the episode ends. If they switched to filming every other weekend for longer and making each episode a two-parter it would give the writing team some time to come up with something creative, and there wouldn't need to be so much time spent on greetings.",

But mostly because with the word game, I know the jokes. It's the same exact schtick every time: YJS and JSJ are gonna mess up, JSM and KJK are rarely gonna get called because they're good at it, and the rest are just fillers. With the picture game, I feel that YJS was kind of overdoing it with the cheating a bit like hinting that it was his drawing, related to one he's seen before, etc. \n\nSo I agree. However, even if the writers are new: the concept of the show isn't. It's still a show that has been running for 13 years. There's only so many variations of a spy game they can come up with. The cast is also very good at noticing each other's tells. I'm afraid recycling old material might receive backlash and introduce unwanted comparisons. \n\nI would totally understandable if they want to avoid that.",

Imo the PD is using this game as a \"cheat\" to eat up screen time since she doesn't have much else planned. Imo they should've just cut the strawberry game and showed the second half of the matching game instead, which was way more fun.\n\nEvery time the PD announces the next game is strawberry game I groan. This game should be gone for good. Even the guests don't seem to actually enjoy it. I miss the pirate game now.",

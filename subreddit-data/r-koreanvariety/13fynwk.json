I almost choked when Na PD was like ???? and Eunji translated what Mimi said for the staff \ud83d\ude02 And her rant that she didn't get smarter, cause he told her not to read books had me in stitches. \n\nI really like the interactions and banter between the staff and the cast when they play games, they make it really entertaining. Like giving extra points for being entertaining even if the dance wasn't perfect, giving them a second chance at the food, not being too strict with the counting. Another PD would've just *ddaeng*\\-ed them out during the chaos saying that the time has passed.",

Cast and crew now understand each other too well like butter and bread that their chemistry just explodes. Some of my thoughts while watching:\n\n\\- I said this once and I will say it again, Earth Arcade brings out the best of Yujin's variety potential. She's so comfortable and doesn't have to bear the weight of being a leader for an idol group and being her age. &gt;!\"Use this as an excuse to convince my agency \" lolololol. !&lt;\n\n\\- Mimi definitely upgrade her variety game/sense. In the first season, she just acts according to her natural personality, but in this ep, you could feel that she accumulate enough experience and feel the timing to create funny remarks while still keeping her character.\n\n\\- Youngji is still awesome as ever. But I could feel that she was a little emotional. Maybe due to the timeline being too close to SMTM and to all the unfair criticism she got during that time. Still bringing her A game thou. Respect.\n\n\\- Eunji is still the unsung hero/most valuable player (in my heart) for this show. Her timing on details and joke setting is still wonderful. Basically the conductor/on-field PD. Road to 2nd Baeksang in 2024 with Earth Arcade season 2 let's gooooo.\n\nI got a good feeling for this season, gonna exceed the first season in terms of fun. We are on to one heck of a wild ride.",

Theres no way Starship sues Na Pd or Yujin for this. Earth Arcade is providing them free promotion. Going to war with Na Pd would be equivalent to death for starship, Na Pd has too many fans. \n\nAlso its very unlikely they they specifically breakdown that clause in a way that Yujin would be in breach. Yes the contract probably says that they have control of her appearance/image while she is within the group, but her cutting her hair doesn\u2019t break that rule. Starship can still get her a wig and fix it. \n\nAlso if the contract was so restrictive that it had control of Yujin\u2019s appearance outside of the groups work activities, then Yujin wearing a shorthair wig would be in breach of that contract because her fans are seeing her with short hair anyway, but even worse, it looks like shit because short hair wigs are always harder to pull off than long hair.",

Dont forget, not only must she keep appearances for her performances, but she also has her CF deals as well like can you imagine the Clio model, a makeup brand with boyish hair??\n\nWearing a wig is completely different, as she can just take it on and off so theres no reason why wearing a wig would breach the contract????

I\u2019m happy when she remembers dances and is having dun with the girls but then she switched in to korean comedian mode which is the most bland cookie cutter thing ever. Its not just her like 95% of korean comedians run the same boring script. \n\nEverytime she gives her opinion on the taste is completely insincere and then she goes into the describing the taste schtick. Its so fake. \n\nThen her biggest sin on this show is that whenever she fails to know a dance she always panics and goes into comedian mode trying to do something over the top to get a laugh instead of letting the rest of the members shine who actually know the dance. Youngji sometimes slips into dancing funny as a joke but she still tries to hit the dance even if its just doing a little freestyle, she rarely steals the spotlight from the other girls while Eunji tries to steal the spotlight everytime she fails a dance. The first time she did it, it was fine, but like most korean comedians she loves to operate like a robot and do the same thing every time.",

They're all in condition and comfortable to each other that even **MIMI** isn't understandable anymore by her translator **EUNJI**.\n\nThis was just a banger opening for a second season of a variety show, have not laughed too much since last season or even any variety show I've seen. This is setting the bar high for me.\n\nNow in terms of rating, we almost doubled from last season's episode 1. Which is a good sign meaning more people, especially the older generation are watching it. Take note, cable ratings are still relevant in terms of how much money they are gonna rake in. In OTT, they are number 1 in TVING and still trending now in Youtube Korea. That's how much gen MZ loves this show.\n\nAlso, talking about money. They bagged the 2nd biggest producer of soft drinks in the world! **PEPSI** is the main sponsor followed by **GATORADE** (which is owned by Pepsi) and **CLIO** also. They all have 1 common denominator and they have **YUJIN** as an advertiser and I think that played a role in them dumping money on this show.\n\nSo here's to a good ride!",

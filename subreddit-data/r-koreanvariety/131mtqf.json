How they brought all the ingredients from SKorea and like... all of it. As someone who used to do a lot of pre-production on shows this would have been super interesting to me. All the shiny, front end stuff is fun as well, no doubt, but I wished we had all the work that went behind the show, even if it was just an episode. I did a quick scroll, but it's not even on Channel Shiboya.\n\nI wished we had all the back of the scenes clips on all of Na PD's shows, to be fair. Korean Hostel in Spain, all the 3 Meals etc etc. We have music video behind the scenes, why not popular shows, too?",

    "postText": "This week SBS's Running Man which first aired in 2010, will set a tie record for the longest domestic variety show as it celebrates its 563th episode. MBC's Infinity Challenge first aired in 2006, had been on the \"national entertainment list\" throughout its airing, and ended its 13 year run in 2018 with 563 episodes.\n\nIf Running Man, hosted by national MC Yoo Jae-suk airs just two more times, it will set a record for the longest-running variety show in Korea surpassing Infinity Challenge. In particular, the record will be unique to Yoo Jae Suk.\u00a0\n\nInfinity Challenge unfortunately ended, but Running Man will continue to run and meet viewers. Recently, main member Lee Kwang Soo left for health reasons, but the production team has made it clear for the time being there will be 7 members without any member changes. As for the chemistry between the members is getting better day by day, viewers are looking forward to how far Running Man will write history.\n\n[https://www.insight.co.kr/news/347224](https://www.insight.co.kr/news/347224)\n\n[https://www.wikitree.co.kr/articles/666461](https://www.wikitree.co.kr/articles/666461)\n\nTo clarify this is based on # of eps not years, &amp; for variety not talk show. A rare accomplishment.",

A show can't be 100% funny to everyone but what's kept me coming back are the people. I'm sure everyone here who has a favourite variety show keep watching because the members are great, or perhaps because a particular PD is great.\n\nIt's changed a lot over time but I'll probably end up watching it until it finishes. I started watching IC pretty late and even though I liked it, the RM cast was more my style when I first started watching Korean TV.\n\nThe loss of Kwangsoo was huge, probably larger than when Joongki or Gary quit, but I think the show still has time left. Recent episodes have been pretty funny despite their simplicity, but it's understandable if people don't enjoy it as much as the early days which were brutally physical.",

Joongki impact was minimal as he left very early on the show and while Gary's was substantial, his character was already running out of steam (as stated by him in an interview and it was obvious on screen).\n\nKwangsoo though. This guy had been one of the major carries of the show since pretty much the beginning until his last day.",

I had episodes where I damn near teared up with the cast or just felt emotional.

I'm glad that they're at a point where they're having to close bc they don't have certain food items. as Seo Joon said, maybe if they just focus on selling all the chicken they can close early and enjoy the time off.",

It's a real life version of the computer game \"Diner Dash.\"\n\nI saw comments from previous threads of people getting disappointed with how this isn't fulfilling their expectations as a \"healing\" show, due to how different it is from Youn's Kitchen and Youn's Stay. But Seojin has his own different management style. Looking at this as a stand-alone, the show is OK with me.",

The first 40 minutes were just repetition of previous episodes but I am glad they're adding more rice menu for next week. Personally speaking, I feel like they should take out the ramyeon instead of tteokbokki, but considering how ramyeon is one of the best sellers, I guess that's not happening haha. I am excited to see Yumi cooks! She was very efficient in previous series.\n\nI like how Seojin is aware that the staffs are all burned out, and gifted them some playtime! It's nice to see them enjoying Bacalar, it's such a pretty place! Also, Yumi and him bickering is something I miss from previous Youn's series.\n\nTaehyung sneakily asked for promotion is quite funny, also those three? customers who waited for him to pop out lol.",

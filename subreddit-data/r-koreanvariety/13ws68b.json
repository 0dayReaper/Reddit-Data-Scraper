One of my family members has/had a smaller band and they have a song that they get royalty checks from a tv show in Korea (band stopped nearly a decade ago). He doesn't know the show but I figured maybe someone here would. He would love to know the show. The song is below:\n\nPerfect Day by Gnu Kung Fu\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/3VBCc3GT3HHi22OHevHouV?si=ekFgb1N1QS2HBPevSWyTAQ&amp;context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A66XQqZOlwBapxbDre2KB1V&amp;fbclid=IwAR0VeaeLKMfDRJxReipliOcbPUiIVRKLrBZiHxtfGiqjOLioNUnwKyer3p4&amp;nd=1](https://open.spotify.com/track/3VBCc3GT3HHi22OHevHouV?si=ekFgb1N1QS2HBPevSWyTAQ&amp;context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A66XQqZOlwBapxbDre2KB1V&amp;fbclid=IwAR0VeaeLKMfDRJxReipliOcbPUiIVRKLrBZiHxtfGiqjOLioNUnwKyer3p4&amp;nd=1)",

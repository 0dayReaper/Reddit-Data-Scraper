            "comment": "Hello (sorry for my English).\n\nI am a huge fan of Korean variety shows and I watched them for the past 10 years. When I was going through some of the most difficult times in my life, watching variety shows helped me get through. Over the years I watched a lot of shows but two I loved the most are Invincible Youth and Running man. Goo Hara was really great on both of the shows and become one of my top favorite idols.\n\nTwo years ago I finished school and got a job. Since then I didn\u2019t have as much time to watch variety shows and Korean news as before. When the situation with her asshole ex-boyfriend broke out I didn\u2019t know what to think about it and didn\u2019t think it\u2019s that serious. Even when she tried to take her life for the first time I still thought it cannot be that bad. I guess there was some sort of denial in it. I thought it simply cannot happen to my bias. After some time, she started performing again, appeared on some Japanese show and then released a new amazing song Midnight Queen\u2026 Everything seemed fine again\u2026.\n\nAnd then Sulli. I always thought she was the \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about haters type\u201d and that was the reason I really liked her. But I guess on the inside, she had to suffer a lot.\n\nWhen Sulli left, I think it was the last bit for Hara. She just lost all hope\u2026. I wish I could have done something for her. I didn\u2019t even send her DM (stupid, I know, she had to receive thousands of messages). I know I could not really do anything; I live on the other side of the planet and she didn\u2019t even know I exist. But still, she gave me so much happiness during my hard times that the thought I should have done more for her is there\u2026 I just wish so much I could have taken care of her :(.\n\nA few years ago I started to study Korean. I read on the internet that it\u2019s good to have a long term goal. My goal was to be able to watch Invincible Youth without subtitles. Now I can\u2019t watch any of her shows. It's just too painful to see her laugh and know that she is gone forever. Watching her last Instagram live is even worse, to see her in such a painful state. I don\u2019t believe in any kind of afterlife, that is why I think it\u2019s important to value life and fight even in the most difficult times\u2026 but when someone leaves\u2026 it just hurts and suicide hurts even more. Just thinking about how much she had to suffer to take such an extreme step\u2026\n\nOne of my dreams was always to meet G7. Even seeing them from far away during some event would be great. Even if it is absolutely ridiculous, when I watch Korean shows I always dream about being there. Being able to film even one episode with them\u2026 and now she is gone. Forever. I still can\u2019t believe it. Part of me just can\u2019t accept it. It feels like part of my happiness and my dreams left with her. I think about her every day and usually, I think of her as if she was still alive. That is the only way I can deal with the pain. Pretending that the emptiness in my soul is not there...\n\nShe was so young, so kind, so talented, so beautiful\u2026 She had such a difficult life, from her parents to her ex-boyfriend. She deserved better. She deserved love. She deserved to be taken care of. She deserved happiness.\n\nI miss her so much\u2026\n\n\\----------\n\nSorry for putting this here, but I don\u2019t know anyone else who watches Korean shows or knows who Goo Hara is and I just had to get it out of me. Please If you know any show that Hara appeared in, let me know and I edit the list above. \n\nThank You and stay strong.",

            "comment": "A few shows to add to your list based on Korean wikipedia / namuwiki pages..hope it helps.\n\nMnet - **Check It Girl S2: Very Suspicious Casting** (Nov/08 - Jan/09). There is very little info available about this show - No wikipedia page, no VOD's.\n\nMBC - **Hunters** (Nov/09 - Mar/10). This was a show about killing wild boars that were causing trouble for farmers and small towns, but was cancelled quickly after backlash from animal rights activitists and concerns that children watching the show would think too lightly of death.\n\nSBS - **Inkigayo** (MC for Nov/11 - Aug/12).\n\nMBC - **Your Angel** [Korean: \ub098\ub294 \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac\ucc9c\uc0ac] (1 Pilot ep in Mar/13). Similar idea to avatar dates in \"Hot Brother\" where the cast members would partner with non-celebrities and the non-celebrities would tell the celebrities what to say. According to the show preview on Youtube, Hara went to her non-celebrity partner's boss and demanded that he stop encouraging overtime.\n\nOnstyle - **Petorialist** (Dec/13 - Feb/14). Reality program about pets.\n\nJTBC - **My Mad Beauty Diary** (2018). Beauty program. There was a news article at the time that her boyfriend also guested on this program but I couldn't find any more details.",

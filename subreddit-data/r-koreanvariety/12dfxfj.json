    "postText": "The show is getting real now. For those that have been waiting from the beginning of the 3rd Visiting Audition, be prepare. JTBC just uploaded a trailer for Ep88 which will be airing after Ep 87 (Luge, Bobsleigh, Skeleton's Audition). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my understanding, they will compete to become the starters. We got 19 players now including 5 new players from the 3rd Audition. I kept seeing number 16 in the video, therefore, my conclusion is they will only choose 16 players out of 19. I'm not sure what will happen to rest of the players but AJH make it very clear that they can leave if they want to. It would be great if we have someone that have a better understanding of Korean to translate the video or discuss it in the comment. \n\nSurvival of the Fittest is ON!\n\nBut can we survive if the one that being kicked out is our bias? Hence my advice, BE PREPARE!\n\nFind a new bias to save your heart and livelihood.\n\nWho do you think will be in the final 16? And who will leave the show/ benched? \n\nCan they stay strong together as a team? Or will years of teamwork, blood, sweat and tears solve everything?",

            "comment": "Update: Upon further investigation in the Youtube's comment section....\n\nMajority of K-nets chose Lee Jang Kun, Lee Hyung Taik and Kim Tae Sul as the candidates that will leave/benched. \n\nImportant information:\n\nIf you look at the soccer field board that filled with players' magnets, Kim Jun Ho, Jo Won Woo, Kim Yong Sik (new Target Striker), and Kim Yo han are nowhere to be seen. Most importantly you can see a new player joined in, K-Nets predicts that he must have been the new player from Luge, Bobsleigh, Skeleton Audition. \n\nSome K-nets complained that this is not a professional soccer team and how AJH shouldn't have try to re-create a new Cheong Chun FC, which is a youth team coached by AJH. (You can refer to esports KBS YT channel. Just search \uccad\ucd98FC)\n\nK-nets even said that JTBC is worried that they might get low ratings because the duration of the 3rd Audition is too long hence we got the early trailer of Ep88.\n\nI know it is tiring for the international fans to keep up with the show since Netflix is 7-8 episodes behind and there's not much people that take enough interest to translate the show but I hope my posts can keep you interested and can invite more fans to the community. \n\nLets Play Soccer Fans! Fighting!!!!",

But from what I know, CWH and LDG are not the main people to be blame because it was the boards idea and decision to gave amnesty to the players that involved in match-fixing. So basically, CWH and LDG resigned as KFA executives as they failed to prevent the amnesty from happening.\n\nYou have to keep in mind that the show was filmed a few weeks earlier than the actual episode, and it will be a waste to stop airing the show. Worse case, they might edit them out of the show, and thats all.\n\nI dont know much about Shooting Stars. What happened to the show? Do they stop airing the episode?",

If you think about it, they kinda created their own tournament. Title match is kind of a tournament itself, but if the opposition doesn't take the Eojjeoda team seriously, it looks like they only play around with the ball. But our last two title matches weren't so bad, in my opinion, if it's not for the GKs, we could have won it easily.\n\nThey should really consider posting an aftershow training or behind the scenes on YT. You know, to keep the interest going. I mean, if they want too they will make it happen. Bad marketing, really.\n\nI can't say much on the team formation as I never take note of it. I only focused on my bias ,Captain Lim Nam Kyu. \ud83d\ude05 You have no idea how much time I spent on watching Nam Kyu's goals. I mean, the man is terrific.",

His skills haven\u2019t improved even tho he\u2019s on another soccer team which is weird to me.\n\n-Taebum makes too many mistakes and also doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s improving.\n\n- For Jihwan I actually think he should stay but even though his skill has improved he makes too many bad decisions on the field that lose the ball.\n\n- I also like Wonwoo and think he should stay but lately his skill has dropped probably because he has his Sailing to focus on.\n\nI don\u2019t think entertainment wise it would good to cut any members though because the format they have now isn\u2019t that entertaining because the opponents they\u2019ve been choosing and the fact that we already barely see them do any team training besides those drills before a game. Most of us fans fell in love with our biases because of their skill and we stay because of their skills and interactions with the other members.",

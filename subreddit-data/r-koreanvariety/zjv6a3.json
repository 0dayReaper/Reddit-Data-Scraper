With all the recent minus-one tour which may have been a hit or miss for some of us, this was a breath of fresh air.\n\nI really liked how Yoo Seon Ho managed to blend well with the members even if Din Din wasn\u2019t with them. It felt so natural and it was so enjoyable that there was no dead air or awkwardness at all. It\u2019s like he wasn\u2019t a new member at all, and thank God that he didn\u2019t seem shy at all even if he the hyung line outnumbered the maknae line. \n\nAlso, I especially enjoyed how the hyungline targeted DinDin all throughout the episode lol, repeatedly saying that he only had DinDin is DinDin as his song was savage \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 and the way they suggested that they can all sing a new song with DinDin as the producer was quickly shut down by SeYoon was super savage as well \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc80 Poor DinDin getting forcefully evicted from the show just like how they teased Se Yoon a few episodes ago \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nI\u2019m super excited for the next episode, and I\u2019m excited to have DinDin meet the new maknae.",

It feels ike such a long time since we have the members driving in the car together like this, their natural chat are so hilarious!\ud83d\ude06 Look PD, they can have fun perfectly on their own if they're together. The members are shocked with the very young new maknae. Hopefully Yoo Seon ho the new maknae can adapt well and bond quickly with the members. Seyoon and Jongmin are great as usual to break the ice, Jung hoon was still a bit quiet with the maknae, maybe he needs some times to process everything first \ud83d\ude05\n\nChan song Dindin's manager and alter ego is a scene stealer, can't wait to watch him playing games on Dindin's behalf. From what I remember from the jegi game before when he was scolded by Dindin, he's not that good at game\ud83d\ude02",

I think it's just tiredness and he was in diet for his drama, his cheek is sinking a bit too. When I watch his old compilation videos, he looks different and cheerful with bright eyes. But I can agree something about his outer appearance/first impression that doesn't seem like the perfect match with the existing members, maybe he lacks the warm feelings, and he's very MZ gen style youngster too, it's different style from the existing members that we are used to so far. In woo is young but he is a bit an old soul like the older ones. \n\nLet's give the new guy some times to adapt, we also need to adjust our expectations \u263a\ufe0f",

He can't help but to be nervous, he didn't get to sleep at all before the filming, let's give him some times.. I've read that he only had 3,4 days after meeting with 2D1N producer before the actual filming day, so that must be a lot of pressure too..",

I'm not sure. \n\nBut I can imagine that happening if he was introduced in the opening and in an old fashioned way. During his introduction a lot of things are happening that reacting on the Seonho name just seems too out of place. They could be reacting differently on their heads but couldn't find the right time to blurt that out. Dindin having less filter might have but he's not in the episode. \n\nBut anyway I think saying something about KSH is a bit unfair to both Seonhos because it would totally take away the attention from YSH's introductory episode as a new member and would also end up creating multiple articles rehashing what happened and getting KSH's name dragged in it once more.",

They're working damn hard to shoot so I prefer if all the news related to 2D1N talking about them only.

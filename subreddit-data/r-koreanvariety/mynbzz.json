Youn asked Brad Pitt at the beginning of her speech \"Where were you when we were filming in Tulsa?\" because Brad Pitt's company Plan B produced the movie. She jokingly said in another interview about how everyone on the set was wondering if he'll come visit the set. And she also complained about how much crap she went through because of the low budget of the production. So her comment to Brad Pitt was actually more of a complaint.\n\nBut now everyone is running with this ridiculous notion that she was flirting or hitting on him. Ugh.",

BTS is another example (ahem sorry rearing my ARMY fangirl side here). Most of their American interviewers tend to ask them really frivolous questions, this was especially the case when they first broke into the market. It seems to be better nowadays and there are a handful of interviewers who would focus on their artistry instead of 'what's your fav food?' 'which Western artist do you wanna collab with?'",

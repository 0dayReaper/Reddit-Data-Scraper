It went crazy toward the 2nd half of the episode.\n\nNot going to give any spoilers but pls watch it alone or your parents may think you are crazy lolz....\n\nPersonal thought:\nLast thread Im hoping that Yujin will grow to be like Taeyeon as a leader and variety show master. Barring any problems, I think she will be a combination of Lee Hyori and Taeyeon. That is how good she is now.\n\nMimi as usual is blur and innocent lolz... Younji is chaotic and eunji is calming.\n\nEnjoy this episode and beware of the laughter lolz\n\nEdit: add more after watching the sub episode",

This is actually a good and well produced show and is entertaining enough with them 4. On a production standpoint it is better like this as they have better dynamics and the the direction is able to focus on only them and the girls can fully develop their show characters more. Other PDs must envy the staff of this show because the cast can generate their own screentime. Adding more members would be boring and will just be a bloated mess. Honestly the only criticism for this show is it's not long enough. I could suggest they should have more episodes per season because they had to edit a lot of stuff out like scenery and just the girls goofing around.",

They teased like 10seconds of the baltic sea last episode and then showed like 10 seconds of the baltic sea. Also, the rewards shopping time was so empty. Yujin wasn\u2019t even filmed buying anything she just took a photo. \n\nAlso what the hell is up with the editing showing them on the train and then teleporting back to the house to pack and leave for the train? Such an odd choice. \n\nThey definitely struggled this episode, and most of the issue comes down to planning. They are still Jetlagged and they are already going to travel again for 10 hours, and because of that travel they had to force multiple games into the Jetlag days.\n\nIts honestly really weird. They are moving before torong even appears. \n\nI don\u2019t think they need 6 members because the girls are really good at dragging the crew members into the show, but yea when the planning is messed up its a lot harder for them to carry the show with just 4 members.",

                            "comment": "Sad getting downvoted. Anyways. first about editing, Hyunyoung PD seems to be having a hard time editing since way back in Season 1. From putting the morning mission in the directors cut to having to film additional shoots mid season.  And I kinda see why in some ways. The casts go 0 to 100 real quick and vice versa. Example of this is the morning mission. They kinda go 100 at the start. Then probably 90 when they were dealing with Youngji's fruit. Then around 70 when they learned Yujin's fruit is in the safe. Then go to 0 real quick because well, the two other fruits are hidden well while the other is in the safe, so why waste energy waiting. Incredibly weirdly paced game.\n\nThats why I advocated for 6 members instead of 4. Cause there are some games that work well in a 6 member setting. Also, I wouldnt be surprised if they can do more creative games in a 6 member due to 2v2v2 or 3v3 rather than a 4 member setting.\n\nAs for the planning/jetlagged issue, the staff really have a good itinerary all things considered looking back. They just didnt account that the cast would wake up really early and didnt sleep back (due to jet lag). The introvert on me would definitely sleep back though. The other thing is also the staff didnt expect the zombie game to drag out that long nor make the casts tired. The area is small enough to cover the wingspan of three people yet Yujin lasted 13 minutes. Imo, if the casts didnt go whole EXID \uc704 \uc544\ub798 \uc704 \uc544\ub798, the zombie game would probably last around Eunji's time (5 minutes).",

It's just really about the planning, you cant blame them waking up early bec of jetlag. They tried to calm themselves after waking up at 4am but they cant sleep bec well, they're jetlagged. Even na pd and director apologized for poor planning in the live after\n\nPlus the 0 to 100 real quick is part of their charm, it's honestly one of their best points. Imo this ep is good, not the best, but I come to realize I cant expect them to be 100 every episode bec viewers will be tired watching them\n\nImagine, they cramped 4 episodes on 2 days filming - that's all about directors choices. I wont say this is one of the best ep but it's definitely not bad, they hit the highest rating (compared to every ep)  in this ep I think",

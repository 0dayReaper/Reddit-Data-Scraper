    "postText": "I think some people who been watching sometimes curious about Lee Sang Min debt. Why he's still using the debt jokes after all these year? 7 years ago, he still in debt, 5 years ago still in debt, last year? Still in debt. Some people do ask the question regarding his debt in this sub in the past, usually under My Ugly Duckling and Knowing Brothers thread. \n\nAs latest episode of My Ugly Duckling, Lee Sang Min said he gonna paid all the debt between autumn and winter which took 17 years to paid all of it. Seo Jang Hoon also add, \"In the past, he almost paid all of it, but suddenly the debt increase again\". So, I just casually search and the debt increase because interest and long lasting payment which in result the total remaining debt is 1,9 billion won. \nSo yeah, as long there's no problem occurs, he gonna clear his debt this year. \n\nBe prepared to say goodbye for the running jokes about debt. I do wonder what kind of antics he gonna bring to us, because a lot of time the jokes all about debt and divorce, and now only divorce left. \n\nBtw, the total of the debt 6,9 billion won (around 6 million dolar).",

The funny thing is he has kept those written contracts but he isn't using them to take his \"friends\" to court to get his money back. He mentioned before he even knows where one of them is and that person ran away to the US but LSM still has his contacts but he doesn't want to ask for his money back because he trusts that that \"friend\" will pay him back eventually. That kind of goes to show why he is in this predicament in the first place... So really we don't even know if some of the debts are new.",

He might have difficulty getting out because he's not good at saying no though.",

But LSM is definitely not all that innocent and vulnerable. But at least he didn't run away and is actually paying his debts back despite how long it takes unlike some of his \"friends.\" Remember if LSM wanted to, he could've easily fled the country and just start over elsewhere and left the entertainment industry entirely but he chose to do the right thing by owning up to his bad decisions and paying people back. I don't know if he has learned his lesson though seeing as his debts continue to pile up. But then again interest rates have increased significantly the past couple of years so maybe that affects his debts too and why it almost seems like he keeps owning more and more every year.",

It's true, he didn't run away and is paying his debts and it's also true his wife sued him. Sometimes some people like feeling like they are needed and he might be one of those people. Like when someone asks you to be a guarantor it's definitely not a random stranger but someone who you should know well enough or else how do you even know they will pay you back. Either that or he easily falls for lies and is easily manipulated but I don't think he is that naive. Some of those friends who he signed as guarantors for could've been at one point extremely close to him or have helped him in the past but It only takes one small incident to ruin an entire friendship and unfortunately if you sign as a cosigner for someone and if they run away and don't pay, then the loaners come to the next person on the paper and like I said LSM could've easily ran away or went into hiding but he is continuing his career while paying what he owns off. Since he still has a career and hasn't been entirely cancelled by the court of public opinion and the fact that he is still booking shows, multiple shows at that means he isn't that bad of a person or else we definitely wouldn't see him on TV anymore that's for sure, so he's doing something right.",

He can be getting scammed by friends and in turn causing him to make bad decisions. But if he really scammed his own friends they would be coming out and trying to tarnish his image even until now but if he made things right with them which is highly more likely since he wouldn't have a career otherwise. Hence why I said he can't be that bad of a person. Do you think people would want to work with him? Do you think he would even have friends now if that was the case. He would've been cancelled yesterday and those friends wouldn't want to see him on TV if he did them so wrong. Even if they spoke up in the past, if they aren't speaking up now it means they were able to settle things with LSM or come up with a solution or their accusations were false in the first place and that is why you don't hear from them now.",

Money or lack of it does not equal morality or human value and judging it this way in such terms is gross. Plenty of poor people are shitty people and plenty of people with money are very good people. Sang Min is working to pay his debts rather than discharge them and while doing that, which is the right thing to do, is also living. You feeling nothing for someone based on these terms says way more about you than it does about anyone else.",

I personally don't feel bad for him since he obviously has friends who are willing to help him and his average lifestyle is still miles better than most people (in fact I'm envious of many aspects of his life) but I understand from his perspective he lived lavishly at his peak and had to adjust accordingly and that's harder than most people think. Moreso, it's probably the stigma of him being in debt and being made fun of everywhere that gnaws at him the most which with this news means he should be rid of soon.",

For people who survived a long time (like 10 years++), It's only matter of utilizing his self and his trait or any things that can be used as a way to entertain and keep being relevant to people and keep getting the bag. \n\nBut let's be real tho, there's much time where he himself or other use that as a joke so it not really stretch to say that he have that as his own character or persona or alter ego or whatever word you want to put it.\n\nAfter all, a character or persona can be build base on imagination or observation that not related to the individual itself, or based on individual trait as it's or exaggerated more for entertainment purpose. Also a lot of people is heavily reliant on their character and got emphasized and associated by their jokes that they carried out through time, ex : park myung soo with his rude and angry old man character as he got associated with that and mostly can get away when he doing some thing that not really considered as \"polite\" in public. \n\nThese character, persona, or alter ego also can make distinct separation between tv personality that make him stand out, after all having a heavy debt former top group personnel is not that common at all.\n\nAight, let's back to it. Either in his show like KB or MUD, there's many time he brought that as his jokes and makes the editing process and getting his airtime so it's not really stretch to say he use it as jokes to make a living and paying his debt using his debt as jokes.",

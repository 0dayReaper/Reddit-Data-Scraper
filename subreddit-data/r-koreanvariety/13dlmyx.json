Not sure why the last three eps are unavailable. https://pluto.tv/en/search/details/series/64076d9084f6610013638acc/season/2\n\nAlso, for the last month or so, the CJ ENM Channel (378) on Roku has been airing episodes 1-11 on the weekends. \n\nHope you\u2019re able to access the show! It\u2019s such a light and breezy vacation \ud83c\udfdd",

    "postText": "Transit Love is the only dating show I have watched from the first episode down to the last episode. I know that Heart Signal is a show where a single men and women joins the show and lives in the Signal House, but how do they send the signals or texts, how do they pick dates, and how they do the final selection? Also, how many days or weeks they would stay in the house? Did the final selections really became in a relationship after the show?",

            "comment": "1) signals just refers to body language and comments of the cast, thats why the panel has a lot of screen time in this series-its their job to read those signs and figure who who is interested in whom.\n\n2) texts are sent to a PD/writer who then delivers the messages anonymously, so no one knows who sent what.\n\n3) dates can be done by random selection or the casts choice, it just depends.\n\n4) in previous seasons they got the person's number and called them to make their final choice.\n\n5) filming is done for a month.\n\n6) most dont actually become couples. We've had a couple successful pairings from other shows (Love Catcher, EXchange), but I dont think anyone from heart signal has lasted.",

And since you\u2019re coming from Transit Love. Don\u2019t expect it to be on par with that show. Heart Signal is the vanilla of dating shows in SK.",

    "postText": "Well, a specific one. \n\nTo make a long story short, in 2015 when I was in college (i'm American) a Korean classmate asked for couples to get interviewed for a 'project'. I didn't ask a lot of questions and signed me and my boyfriend at the time up. Didn't realize til weeks later when the classmate showed me the clip that it was on actual television. At the time there were no subtitles and she didn't explain the pop-up  I had asked for the link a few times (how many people are gonna believe you when you say you've been on korean tv? needed the proof accessible haha) but the last time i asked too much time had passed and she couldn't find it either. All she could give me was a name. \n\n\"Witch Hunt\"\n\nI have three pieces of information about this episode-- It was most likely filmed in the fall of 2015, and since the show ended by December my episode is probably in the last 30-40 episodes (iirc i was wearing a coat that day, so can't have been too early in the season)\n\nthe topic my bf and i were interviewed about was (i think) a little lost in translation. she explained this concept of an 'inside person' in a couple (maybe like, introverted? but broader) and an 'outside person' in a couple and asked us to tell her which one of us was which. for reasons i can't surmise (which is why i need to track down this episode) my answer provoked a big reaction from the hosts. I still don't know what they said!!\n\nSO what i'm looking for is a place where I can find the later episodes of witch hunt. They don't need to be subtitled in english (though that would certainly be a plus) and frankly if i HAVE to pay for them i might....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all in advance for your help!! It would be amazing if after all these years i could finally get my hands on this episode",

My korean coworker is getting a laugh out of it rn and i am so stoked that i can finally tell people I was on TV in Korea and prove it! thank you all so much for your help!!!!!!",

(Also to search for episodes just go like xxx\ud68c). Also if you know the date/time, Episodes are usually labelled yyyymmdd, so you might also be better off there.  \n\nGood luck!",

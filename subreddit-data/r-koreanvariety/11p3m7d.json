The vibe was great,the games were fun, especially when yang se chan came up with the unusual bet in the bus.The cast seems to enjoy each other,and the location with so much snow. As a person who never seen snow in his own eyes,the whole location kinda seems magical or fairytale-ish to me.\nAnd great to see Bopil PD again.Looking forward to the next episodes.",

All the cast are so funny and complement each other's chemistry well! \n\nAnd I'm amazed at Sechan's ability to turn a boring bus ride into a hilarious bet. I've always liked him in RM, but his variety skills are able to shine more here since he's the oldest/has more variety experience.",

Had absolutely no idea the PD was Bopil PDnim \ud83e\udd23\n\nThe first ep was a blast! Im loving their dynamics already, so many stupidly hilarious moments haha",

I thought they were like different persona but Kyungsoo said he has some similarities with Zico and that surprise me\n\nI hope it will stay fun till later",

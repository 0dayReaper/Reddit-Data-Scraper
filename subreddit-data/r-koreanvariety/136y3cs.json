target but **(GV 74- GK)** gets her hand on the ball and knocks it out of bounds for another corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~5' GT Miss: **(GV 13)** tries to clear the ball to her left with a

first touch and the ball continues down the middle with **(GV 48)** chasing the ball down to hopeful get a shot, **(GT 21- GK)** comes off her goal line and smothers the ball before a shot can be taken!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' GT Miss: **(GT 18)** takes a sideline kick-in that is basically a corner kick and shoots the ball with a speedy low roller to the top of the 16 yard box, that **(GT 100)** manages to kick on net, but looks to be going wide, **(GT 7)** is there to re-direct the ball but takes too much of the ball's force and the ball rebounds in front of **(GV 13)** who kicks it out of bounds!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' GT Miss: **(GT 18)** takes a sideline kick-in that is cleared by **(GV 5)** the ball goes forward and into **(GT 1)**'s path, **(GT 1)** takes a deep shot on net but misses to a few feet to the middle of the right post, **(GV 74- GK)** was in position to block the ball if it was on target!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' GV Miss: **(GV 35)** dekes out **(GT 18)** and dribbles down the right wing, **(GV 35)** takes a shot on target from far away that **(GT 21- GK)** smothers easily!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' GT Miss: **(GT 1)** takes the ball away from

corner to **(GT 100)** who traps the ball and passes back to the middle to a wide open **(GT 1)**, **(GT 1)** takes her time to gather the ball and square up to the net, and threads a beauty pass to a wide open **(GT 18)** on the left side who one-time redirects the ball into the top right GOAL POST!!!! the ball was re-directed with pace and it pops back into play and right into **(GT 1)** feet, who takes a shot but misses the mark but a large margin, a great sequence of passing that didn't end up in the back of the net, great tic-tac-toe passing, great vision by **(GT 1)** to see that **(GT 18)** was wide open on the left side!&lt;\n\nHALFTIME SCORE LINE: &gt;!------- GT 1 - 0 GV------------, Giants need to score one more goal, to get out of Group B's basement!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~10' GT Foul: **(GV 5)** and **(GT 1)** kick at a bouncing 50/50 ball and **(GV 5)** screams in pain that she got hit on her right ankle, the whistle blows and the play is dead, didn't look like a foul to me, but a direct free-kick is awarded close to the GT net, near the top of the 16 yard box to the left wing sideline!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~10' GV Miss: **(GV 34)** takes the direct free kick with a shot on target that goes just past the defensive wall to the right side and **(GT 21- GK)** drops down and gets her knee to block the ball and it goes out of bounds to the opposite sideline!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~10' GV Miss: **(GV 34)** takes sideline kick-in with a cross to the opposite side left post that **(GT 21- GK)** manages to get her right

Miss: **(GV 35)** nutmegs **(GT 18)** and dribbles down the middle with speed, she takes a shot on target but **(GT 1)** stands tall and blocks the ball, the ball flies towards GV territory where **(GV 13)** volley traps the ball and manages to keep control of the ball and takes a deep volley shot on target that **(GT 21- GK)** manages to kick forward rather than catch it, **(GV 35)** comes in with speed to take a power shot that misses the mark by a wide margin to the right side, great flurry of action for GV's offense!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!11' GT Goal: **(GT 21- GK)** throws the ball into play deep towards the right wing, with a one-on-one between **(GV 13)** and **(GT 100)**, **(GT 100)** outmuscles **(GV 13)**, **(GV 13)** falls to the ground and no whistle is blown, **(GT 100)** continues down the right wing unmolested and unmarked and takes a power shot on target that **(GV 74- GK)** deflects with her right arm, but the ball isn't deflected enough and goes into the net, the two goal difference that GT needs has been met, what will GV do now that they're in Group B's basement!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' GV Sub: **(GV 48)** subs off for **(GV 5)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' GV Miss: **(GV 34)** takes the centre kick-in with a shot on target that **(GT 21- GK)** re-directs with her hands to the sidelines, ball goes out of

**(GV 74- GK)** manages to block with hands and the ball goes out of bounds for a corner kick, great individual effort by **(GT 100)** but no hat-trick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' GV Sub: **(GV 34)** subs off for **(GV 48)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' GT Miss: **(GT 18)** takes a corner kick, and back passes to a wide open **(GT 1)** who takes a shot on net that misses wide to the top left

**(GV 5)** dribbles the ball down the right wing sideline beating **(GT 18)** as she cuts towards the middle, **(GV 5)** passes to **(GV 48)** who traps the ball and turns to her left with a spin move

takes a sideline kick-in with a pass forward that is intercepted by **(GV 13)** who dribbles forward down the left wing, then cuts towards the middle of the field and eventually the right wing sideline, she passes to the middle which **(GV 35)** takes a power shot on target that **(GT 21- GK)** fumbles, the ball drops in front of her and **(GV 5)** gets to the ball to kick at but **(GT 1)** is there to slow that down and **(GT 21- GK)** smothers the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' GV Miss: **(GV 13)** dribbles down the right wing sideline pulling up and using all her moves to evade **(GT 18)**, **(GV 13)** back passes to **(GV 35)** who passes it right back to **(GV 13)** who then kicks a bouncy cross to **(GV 48)** who one-time volleys but doesn't fully connect with a shot on target that **(GT 21- GK)** fumbles, but a short duration of zombie soccer ensues as GV and GT are trying to get the ball under control, **(GV 13)** is calling for a back pass, and **(GV 35)** gets it back to her, **(GV 13)** kicks a power shot from far away that is low that nutmegs **(GT 18)** and squirts out to the top of the 16 yard box that **(GV 5)** kicks at but **(GT 1)** sticks out her foot and blocks the ball, it goes out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' GT Timeout: **Coach BeomSeok** calls for a timeout he wants GT to start pressuring forward for more offense, **(GT 18)** is subbed off for **(GT 66)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' GV Miss: **(GV 5)** takes a corner kick with a flick kick that goes high, it hits the top of **(GV 48)**'s head and goes out of

34)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!15' GT Goal: **(GT 18)** takes a sideline kick-in with a deep shot aimed at the goalmouth area that **(GV 74- GK)** blocks, the ball is still in play and hits **(GT 100)** and squirts to the left side of the net where **(GT 7)** is all alone, everyone in front of the net is crowded in the middle and **(GT 7)** takes a weak shot with her right foot that goes to the back of the net, **(GV 74- GK)** should have caught the ball, GV are back in the basement of Group B, wild, will they claw back out with a goal of their own?!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' GT Sub: **(GT 100)** subs off for **(GT 66)**, looks like **(GT 100)** has rubber legs, she is exhausted!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' GV Sub: **(GV 5)** subs off for **(GV 48)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17'

sidelines!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' GV Sub: **(GV 5)** subs off for **(GV 34)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' GV Sub: **(GV 48)** subs off for **(GV 5)**, looks like **(GV 34)** was subbed on just to take the sideline kick in!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' GT Miss: **(GT 18)** saves a ball from going out of bounds and crosses a pass to **(GT 100)** who then takes a shot on net that misses the near right top corner post by a foot!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' GT Injury: **(GT 100)** goes down screaming after jumping for a header attempt, both her calf muscles are pulled,  **(GT 66)** subs on, is this the glimmer of hope GV have with **(GT 100)** off the field, **(GV 48)** subs off for **(GV 34)**!&lt;\n\nFINAL SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- **GT 3** - 1 GV------------, GIANTS claw out of the proverbial basement of Group B and yet again, the bubble team that is Gaevengers, never getting better and never getting worse.  Gaevengers needs a team roster overhaul to improve, their team has hit its ceiling with the players they have, HyunYi is stretchered off the field happy with the win.  Gaevengers competed hard but their ceiling as a team is so obvious, would HyeRyun as goalkeeper made a difference?  HeoMin played well!&lt;\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!TG v AC, a mystery player for AC, TopGirl needs to win, looks like a battle between HeIn and BoKyung, another RED CARD, it's a double RED CARD? wtf happened for that to get issued by the referee!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;",

But god damn that sweet tic-tac-toe passing by HyunYi,  KyungHee,  and JinKyung hitting the top corner woodwork was a crazy highlight.  When i saw that from last week's  previews i thought that shot was 100% a goal, just like the crossbar that HyeSun hit.  Both of those i thought were goals.",

For Song Hae Na i was wrong about her not because she scored an rebound **but she did a great job of being sweeper today** and not out of position as usual.!&lt;",

The thing is they **couldn\u2019t handle the barrage of press from CF** through LHH and KJK plus **they expect that Heo Kyung Hee is the spearhead of offense** so they plan to trap her on 2 defendes on lateral side since she can\u2019t handle the ball on close range rather than open space because HKH is deadly on that due to her agility. It\u2019s just basically Giants **out witted them in terms of fielding the players** their defensive approach is weak if Giants can distribute the ball for open striker - which why KJK, LHH and HKH link plays is effective today.!&lt;\n\n\nYou know **there\u2019s a problem** if the defenders is doing the **thing** than the collective output of team. They adjusted well on 2nd half from build ups to set piece but it wasn\u2019t enough to excute. It\u2019s just FW can\u2019t capitalize an opened chance at front.\n\n\nWell it\u2019s not that they\u2019re totally out but can still contest their place at SL but which team is gonna be? The other group is group of death, it was so crazy that they issue an 2 reds on next week match.\n\n\nThis season **have a great replay value,** I purposely didn\u2019t watch all of episode twice so i can binge it once the season is over.",

            "comment": "# First half thoughts: \n\n1. Finally, they moved Jin-kyung up front with Hyunyi and Kyung-hee to the back. Love it. The team looks so stable and balanced now. The ability to get Kyung-hee involved in the offense by utilizing her strengths while giving her the ball (goal kick) and her taking it deep by herself... -chefs kiss-. Pyo is absolutely right in his press conference criticism of not using that formation earlier. \n2. It's so hard to root against Gaevengers (which I do) because of Pyo. Love him as a coach and he genuinely seems like the smartest coach on the show. \n3. I wonder how much of the Gaevengers not looking like themselves is due to the conservative and defensively minded scheme they are playing with 3 defenders, versus how well the Giants are playing with their new player formation. In the first half you didn't see Hye-sun doing any of her highlight plays (being disruptive and chasing people down). Not to mention the Giants seem to be forechecking and covering passing lanes really well as Gaevengers try to build up. \n4. If that pass-pass-and shoot by Jin-kyung had gone in that would have been an all-time top 5 highlight goal. That was wild and awesome. \n5. It shouldn't take getting a pro goalie to teach your futsal goalie the fundamentals of the position. That \"don't move in a straight line, move on a curve\" should be goalie 101 by the instructors they work with. I mean, isn't that one place they train literally named \"Goalie\"? \n\n# Second half thoughts: \n\n1. Lol, isn't it classic Asian mom to be counting all the failures of her kid? \"That's the fourth failed mid-range shot by my daughter. She's not good at it.\" Geez. Lol. \n2. I just can't with the Giants goalie on that kick-in. Come on with that weak defense and being the one to touch the ball so it counted. Come on! So many of these goalies need to be taught to PUNCH the ball. Just make two fists and either punch it or at least put up your forearms and have it hit off those. Better than using your hands and them not being strong enough to stop the ball. \n3. It's a bummer to see Hae Na still has absolutely no touch on her kick. It's either kicking the ball out of bounds on purpose or on accident because she tried to place it somewhere her teammate could receive it but it wildly goes out of bounds. Not much accuracy and no control over her power. After all the time she has played and practiced I'm inclined to think she has hit her talent ceiling with soccer. She won't take that next step as a defender like Yubin (FC Top Girl) has. Having a defender who can defend a pass or kick and then pass it accurately to a teammate on offense is SOOOO useful. I don't think Hae Na will ever be capable of that. \n4. After I write this she knocks a ball near the goal into the goal. Haha. I don't think it proves me wrong but she definitely has value. She doesn't let too much get past her on defense and on offense right at the goal post we've seen her do things like this. Bravo to her. What a gorgeous kick by Jin-kyung btw. Wow. Watch her YouTube and those kicks are exactly what she's been practicing with a teacher, even before she rejoined the show iirc. \n5. But now Jin-kyung places a perfect ball on a kick-in (post-Hyunyi stretcher to sidelines) and Hae-na totally whiffs it. No lie, Jin-kyung is sooooo good at those kick-ins that if the Giants had a player who could divert them towards the goal, they'd score at least 1 more goal a game. \n\n# Post game thoughts: \n\n1. The Giants, with the return of Jin-kyung and moving her up to offense, finally look powerful and balanced. If their goalie can continue to slowly improve, they are a formidable opponent. Handling the most disruptive team on the show, Gaevengers, like they did in this match is a big deal. They weren't bullied, in fact, Jin-kyung bullied Hye-sun with her physicality. The Giants played tough and as they intended, the entire team was vocal (like Hyunyi) and never lost the mental game. \n2. It's hard to tell where the line is as far as making excuses, Gaevengers post game listing all their injuries, and it just being the truth. It could explain some amount, how much I don't know, of why they didn't entirely look like themselves. \n3. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if we see some Gaevengers players leave the team this off-season. Maybe the gig is just too good and steady for them to give up on, but failing to advance and being 2+ years into the show, maybe a player or two says it's time to move on? I wouldn't be shocked. \n\n# Teaser thoughts: \n\n1. All-Star match!!!! Yessssssssssssssssss. Those are the best matches. I wonder what the teaser was for though. It was just \"coming soon\". But if it was an advertisement to sign up for attending in person, you'd think they'd include a tag or something with information on how to apply. Maybe it's intuitive in SK so the viewers know to go check the site and apply if they want to attend. \n2. So it looks like Choi Yoonyoung is gone from Actionista and is replaced by someone new? \n3. Where is Kang So-yeon? She wasn't on the bench with FireMoth all match and then in the teaser she still isn't there. I wonder if she's just busy, late or misses the match for some reason. \n4. DOUBLE RED CARD BABY!!!!! Lol. Things are getting wild. But stay healthy ladies! Plz.",

She has got the \"feeling\" now after last season, especially with that turning shot in the first half. We wouldn't have seen that from her two seasons ago.\n\nFC Gavengers does not have the right personnel to make a better team. We can't move their positions around because they are playing at their best position with their skill set at this moment. Plus the MinKyung and NaMi are just non factors to the opponents. Other than loose balls or second balls, gave up by the opponent, they were not as effective, two seasons ago. Time for an overhaul I think.",

            "comment": "Jin Kyung put in an amazing shift there. Not many players stand up to Hye Sun in full flight; in fact most scatter in panic and fear. World Class gave her the freedom of the pitch and suffered. Jinkyung stood tall and went in hard on several occasions, snuffing out many dangerous situations at source. Her low set-pieces were also bang on point. MVP for me today, despite Hyuni's heroism.\n\nExcellent strategy from Coach Beom; standing off Seung Hye and rushing Hyesun, and using Kyung Hee's stamina to do most of the ball-carrying, maintaining the overall energy and endurance of his forward unit.\n\nWould love to see a rematch between Giants and World Class. That first group match was straight up weird; Giants looked hungover/jetlagged/shell-shocked and were essentially playing the game at a walking pace.",

Just sucks that no one can receive those passes.\n\nHyunYi's two goal game was great.  \n\nGiants looked organized, desperate,  and vocal.  Only weakness for them would be the bench not being used.

For the record I think all teams should use bench more and not just giants or the champions. Ballad dream didn\u2019t even make any sub last game. More than anything I feel bench players should be given more chance to play and so to improve. If haena didn\u2019t play she would be much worse than she is now. I don\u2019t recall Nat fam used their bench a lot on their championship run. Seo Rin needs to improve more to be involved more. But it\u2019s a chicken or egg problem. Whereby they are not given chance to play then how to improve?",

We saw how good FC TopGirl was last season when their core players like Yubin and Rina was out for about 5minutes and more because of injuries. FC WorldClass played a few time with no subs because of injuries, and they also survived. Thats because all the team member can contribute to the team. \n\nThe opposite can be seen with FC Gukdae. See how bad they were after the championship season. Suddenly the subs were thrusted to the main roster without any skills and experience, and expected to perform. Not going to happen.",

Imagine playing against a speedy WorldClass and a more fit team that requires running around full time.

They might not be flashy, like FC Gucheok or FC Actionista, but they will get it done. FC Bullabang was just lucky in that first game.

Each players in this team have the skill sets to affect the course of the game, whether on the defensive or offensive end. It is a 3 players team (Actionista) against a 5 players team (Top Girl)\n\nFC Top Girls played with skills and confidence of a team that know what they can do, or can't do since last season when they went on those 7 wins streak. They will get their game back on for next week, and show everybody why they are the defending champion. I just love them so much :)",

They probably aren't gonna win this season because they fucked up their first game.

Well, in before you actually know what the basics of playing football\n\nAlso \"if the seasons were twice as long, I think there could have been a different outcome?\" Wt are you talking about? Top Girl already played twice the games than others last season since they played through the challenger league and they won all 7 to get the trophy. The are well deserved the title.\n\nAnd yes, the season will always be short and variance is always there. And yet you don't apply it to any other former or future winners. TG is already the example of the victim of the format by having a tougher group and fucking up their 1st game. Will you ever call this season winner a fluke then? I think the only reality check is that you don't really know how football and logic works",

Getting her form and spirit back, which translated to how the team reacted to it. JinKyung also got back into the football groove after some time off. HaeNa proved to be the 6th man that every team needed. Taking advantages of opportunities and very stable on defense. Still a bit unstable goalkeeping but I believe JungSun will get there. KyeongHee was powerful as always but unable to fully unleased her skills. There were glimpses of last season, but it was probably because of the position she was tasked to. Once the GK is more stable, Gucheok can fully \"go crazy\" on their offensive force. They basically have four strikers ready to go but have to be cautious of defense.\n\nLike Sanofi mentioned on previous posts, FC Gavengers will always be on the bubble, but will never burst. They are good, but not good enough to play in the semi. They can definitely handled CL teams that will be coming up. EunYoung showed a developed skills and touches in this game. She has definitely improved, and of course, so were SeungHye and HyeSun. Gavengers strikers have not been effective this season which we all noticed since the past season. It appears MinGyung and NaMi hit the ceiling, and seems unable to break through it. This could be the downfall of the team, especially in Super League. Unless some miracle growth happen to them, we can expect them to remain the same contender team, and not championship team.\n\nAll in all, it was a great game from beginning to the end. Pedal to the metal kind of game which we all love. Just excited to see FC TopGirl again for next week. How I missed them.",

Giants players were faster then her on every 2nd ball and when she's finally on the ball she has 0,5sec to think of something before the spaces are gone. And Giants arent even the youngest/fittest team (WW is the scariest for me now). \n\nHowever Ayumi's a different beast, I don't think there's any GK even close to her agility and reflexes, so she wouldn't regress as much. But sooner or later things will also get much harder for her as players like EudDeum and KyungHee seem to be starting to shoot with more power and accuracy than ever before on the show.",

No more kick-and rush unless you have the speed and skill of Saori. Ball control and dribbling has to be at the level of BoKyoung or HeIn in this league now. Power and tenacity has to be at HyunYi level. Coolness and \"football sense\" has to be at RiNa level. She is just not progressing like all the other players. The most frustrating part, is that she still did not understand positioning and game flow, for someone who has been in this show for a long time. We can't blame wedding or being married, because that was almost 1 year ago, I think.",

Just her presence alone makes Gav players wary of her \"going off\". (Eg like that solo run she had in the 2nd half). Having to keep an eye on her probably created some space metally for her teammates.\n\n\n&gt;They can definitely handled CL teams that will be coming up.\n\nI wouldn't be too sure about that. Gav's offensive duo hasn't been delivering and their defensive duo has been hard carrying. \n\nAlso before they get the chance to handle the CL teams that will be promoted, they still need to face 1 team from the other SL group. Of which any of them can knock Gav down to 6th place and guaranteeing a spot in the CL.\n\nWithout good offense and without HyeRyun between the posts, Gav will be hard pressed to stay in SL.",

Her presence on the field will force the opposing team to be more defensive minded.\n\nFC Gavengers better hope that they will play FC Actionista for the 5th/6th match because they stand a better chance. FC TopGirl or FC Bullabang will definitely knock them to the 6th place. Things do not look good for Gavengers. HaeTae not playing put a damper on their offense since they can't play 3 top, because SeungHye's skill can open up the opposing team's defense. NaMi and MinGyung are not a goal creator.",

So Gav have a fighting chance against them.\n\nPersonally I think Gav should change to a 1-2-1 formation. Nami at the top, SeungHye and MinKyung in mid and HyeSun at the back. SeungHye's potential is too limited at the backline. Having her in the midfield allows her to create space and scoring opportunities and she can support defense if need be.\n\nNami just need to get back to her pre-wedding form.\n\nGav (and BD for that matter) is in a funky place where they are too good for CL but has glaring issues that make them not good enough for SL. So unless those issues are addressed, they will keep doing the promotion/relegation dance.",

Enough of the \u201cOmg are you okay\u201d bs, play hard until the whistle and then be nice afterwards, that\u2019s true sportsmanship. And what a bullet shot, goalie even got a hand on it. I love players and coaches that take it seriously. The fact they said they practiced 6 days a week, at 8am made me shudder thinking about it. That\u2019s dedication JinKyung is back as well, moving her up was the best idea. Her passes were exactly what they needed to have a more offensive threat. KyungHee was kinda disappointing offensively but she played good defense. She was prob nervous to play in front of her mom. I knew HaeNa would start doing more to contribute to offense, she started getting a taste of goals after that one game where she scored 2. I hope SeoRin gets more opportunities to play as well. She\u2019s got a great physique but she\u2019s slow maybe if she practices kickins. Seeing JeongSun get that 1-1 lesson for goal, made me so happy. She worked hard and will only improve with more experience. \n\nGaevengers were kinda disappointing. LYP is my fav coach cause he\u2019s so smart. I think he did prepare them for KyungHee. Hye-Hye sisters lead the team again but honestly they need to be able to pass to a forward to score instead of doing it themselves. Even EunHyung had a turn and shoot goal opportunity. NaMi and MinKyung were absent, no threat from them offensively. That\u2019s bad for the team, YoungPyo needs to work with them more. (Side note I replayed EunHyung kicking HaeNa in the ass and laughed for like 5 mins) \n\nSeems kinda early for an all star but I\u2019m ready! They better not have Saori sitting out again. Also not sure who the other goalie would be\u2026 it seems like Ayumi is the only experienced/all star like goalie. Maybe the FireMoth goalie or Kisum? \n\nNot sure if Topgirl can win, I hope maybe since Action has a new member they will. We\u2019ll see if Mimsy or Dayun will play well, they should have gotten better by now. Let\u2019s hope they can help BoKyoung so she doesn\u2019t become a ball hog. He-In probably the best player but she plays too nice, her mentality really holds her back.",

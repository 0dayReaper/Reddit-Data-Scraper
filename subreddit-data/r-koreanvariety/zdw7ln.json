In EDEN, social norms and customs are done away with: Contestants speak to each other informally and without the honorifics usually used in everyday Korean language. The amount of information they are able to learn about one another is also limited, meaning that hierarchies cannot form easily here!\n\nWhile the first season saw the constants having fun in the sun, the second season promises a new range of pulse-racing games and activities \u2013 with a darker and sexier vibe than the first season. Three celebrity guides \u2013 [Lee Hong Ki](https://www.instagram.com/skullhong12/), [Yoon Bomi](http://instagram.com/__yoonbomi__), and [Simeez](https://www.instagram.com/_simeez/) \u2013 are on hand to watch events unfurl at the EDEN house and provide their commentary. With the romantic vibe turned all the way up to 10, will our hosts be able to contain their excitement...as the contestants\u2019 hunt for love intensifies?\n\n# Panel\n\n- Lee Hong Gi (FT Island) [skullhong12](https://www.instagram.com/skullhong12/)\n- Yoon Bomi (A-Pink) [\\_\\_yoonbomi\\_\\_](http://instagram.com/__yoonbomi__)\n- Simeez (SWF) [_simeez](https://www.instagram.com/_simeez/)\n- Seon Ji Hyun (Eden S1) [ooooog0](https://www.instagram.com/ooooog0) - Guest panel in Ep. 3.\n- Kim Chul Min (Eden S1) [maisonchul](https://www.instagram.com/maisonchul/) - Guest panel in Ep. 4.\n\n# Cast\n\n## Men\n\n- Jo Egeon [j0ysky](https://www.instagram.com/j0ysky/)\n- Kim Dohyun [1031daily](https://www.instagram.com/1031daily/) - Make-up artist\n- Kim Soomin [ssuuuuumin_](https://www.instagram.com/ssuuuuumin_/)\n- Kim Kangrae [kang\\_rae\\_kim](https://www.instagram.com/kang_rae_kim/) - 25 y.o.

I mean, how much screen time do you need of sitting around in a hot tub?  10 minutes seemed excessive.  They could have conveyed everything in about 3 minutes, and moved on to player introductions.",

            "comment": "My thoughts so far: (long post incoming/ possible spoilers?)\n\n\\- I really like DH and SA together compared to SA and KR, dont really have specific reason why but i think they are cute and I love how determined DH was to present himself as an option to SA. Those first 2.5 eps when he didnt get a chance to talk to her I was like \"cmon DH, NOWS UR TIME GO GET IN THERE AND TALK TO HER\" and on the other hand, while she did smile more during her date with KR I feel as if he didn't convince her much, when DH was basically saying \"SY can sense how i feel about you so she shouldnt be a problem, Ill go all in for you\"\n\n&gt;!\\- I also think the couple in the car (kiss on the cheek clip) from the ep 2 preview (?) are possibly DH and SA. DH is a maybe but i think the girl is def SA!&lt;\n\n\\- I also really like KR and SY when they are together. They are both super straight-forward but are complete opposites with everything else. they are very entertaining to watch together (especially when sleeping together i hope to see more of that lol)\n\n\\- I know it was said that most of the girls on the show are there for promotion but I notice it with Lana so much more than the others. She just doesn't seem as into it as the other girls. One example in particular is the few scenes where she is just scrolling on her phone, seemingly blocking everyone else out. She may just be introverted or uncomfortable (since everyone are basically strangers) and finds comfort in social media but I just got an icky feeling when seeing her do that.\n\n\\- I feel for both SM and Lana. SM being rejected and having no other girls hes interested in there made me feel for him but I also understand how burdened Lana was with his interest in her. I do think it was a bit harsh to admit that she would've gone on the date if it was with EG tbh but i mean he is the guy that shes most comfy around so i guess i could understand.\n\n\\- CHAEHEE GURL... I get second-hand embarrassment very easily with her. From my pov it is pretty obvious that EG isn't interested/in the mood when she tries to get close and flirty with him. All her flirting is doing is putting him off more. I think if she didn't come on too strong with him all of the sudden he may want to get to know her more but rn he seems super closed off.\n\n\\- Speaking of EG seeming closed off.. I feel like EG is either only interested in Lana at this point or hes not interested in anybody anymore and is just latching onto lana for some reason. I havent seen him try to actually talk or connect with anyone else (when it seemed like he may start to like SA or SY at the beginning)\n\n\\- in the ep 5 preview&gt;! I think the couple in the bedroom are Lana and KR, the hair was too dark to be SY and too short to be SA or CH (but who knowwssss)!&lt;\n\n\\-My prediction for the room allocation of ep 5 is:\n\nLana/Kangrae  (because of the preview)  \nSoomin (by himself)  \nEgeon/Chaehee  \nSeoah/Dohyun/Seoyeon (Idk abt this but I just want it to happen lol it would be so entertaining)",

In the viki one at the very end there was a clip in the dark (you cant specifically either face) and it seemed to be Kangrae (cz of his muscles, but looking at it again it may not be) and who i guessed to be lana with the blurred face and he was telling whoever it was to lay down a certain way in the bed &lt;that was the preview i was talking about",

Also the guy was too fair skinned to be KR. I am honestly so excited by the fact that the couple at the end of the preview might be Lana and KR because they would be cute together! Lana is harsh and straightforward while KR is clumsy and soft I feel like that would go well together \ud83d\ude2d",

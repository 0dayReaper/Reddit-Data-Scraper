The six members with different charms become friends   faster  than anyone else. They create tension, showing off their   visuals, talents, and charms as they over indulge in games. Look   forward to the   bustling livelihood of the six girls who have been  reborn as true  sisters to settle comfortably in their dream house of  nothing!\n\n**Cast:**\n\n* Hye Ri\n* Miyeon\n* Lee Jung\n* Ye Na\n* Chae Won\n* Patricia\n\n**RAW:**\n\n|1080p.NF-Sniper|magnet:?xt=urn:btih:46d09e524adea6bf5d349e5a2610876bfd681069|\n|:-|:-|\n|1080p.TV Web-DL|magnet:?xt=urn:btih:e90da27ef0b2e52a676b3008d58fd9692de62970|\n\n**Subtitle:**\n\n|Subscene|[https://subscene.com/subtitles/hyemileeyechaepa](https://subscene.com/subtitles/hyemileeyechaepa)|\n|:-|:-|\n|||\n\n**Subbed/Streaming:**\n\n[Streaming - Viki](https://www.viki.com/tv/39624c-hyemileeyechaepa)\n\n[Streaming - Kocowa](https://www.kocowa.com/en_us/season/73810764/hyemileeyechaepa)\n\n[Shows of the Week Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/wiki/shows_of_the_week_2023/week_19/#wiki_sunday_.2823.05.14.29)",

The PD should take note of this, I understand why they started off slow with quiz games since the girls need to build chemistry with each other, but if they do get a season 2, they should definitely have some thrilling missions that let the members move around.\n\nI definitely love the Lee Jung-Yena-Chaewon trinity. Lee Jung is being hassled by both of the younger idols and also dishing it out back to them. It\u2019s hilarious that Chaewon got labelled \u201cLee Jung\u2019s sniper\u201d. I think the PD also know that Chaewon has been teasing Lee Jung whenever she got a chance to. \n\nAnd finally the bottle stands!",

I hope they come back with a season 2 soon! Knowing how busy Le Sserafim is, I hope Chae Won can still keep going! It is not complete without her.\n\nI am loving all the female cast variety shows lately. I hope there will be more!!!",

There was a famous, and much more impactful, song that they used in the full episode that I watched on GoPlay during that moment. I'll try Shazam to see if it can catch it.\n\nThis is the 'Game Plan by Jeon Se Jin' song you Shazam'ed: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFpZE41rcao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFpZE41rcao)\n\nThank you btw.\n\n***\n\nedit:\n\nShazam found it. '[John Wick Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4o2EU5VOzLQ)' by Le Castle Vania. I knew I heard it in a John Wick movie but I only searched the first movie.",

    "postText": "Figured folks might find this a bit amusing.  Sometimes key context is lost in translation, which can surprisingly affect opinions. \n\nFYI, posts are taken from DCInside, which is like Reddit, but with much less moderation, so obviously a lot of males. However,  the galleries(same as a subreddit) for dating shows are majority women. I think. By the way, Korean forum opinions swing extremely wildy depending on episode. Someone who was absolutely hated in one, is absolutely adored in the other. And vice versa. I take it them with a grain of salt.\n\n\nI tried not to be biased and pick only the most upvoted ones with very few downvotes, if other folks who can read Korean can add more upvoted opinions in the comments, that would be great!\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nMajority folks seem to love the YJ SE match, SE seems to be getting a lot of 'she talk and think she so cute' type of hate. Anything related Se Jeong and Han Bin aren't really upvoted at all.\n\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nSeul-gi\n\n\"All you guys say you hate a girl who leads a guy on. Seulgi found out DW talks like a much older guy and isn't her type, so clearly turned him down after he put pressure. Letting him pick another girl. And you're still complaining about her?\"\n\nhttps://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=solohell2&amp;no=2911&amp;exception_mode=recommend&amp;page=2\n\nI love her honesty, she refused to swim with DW, but first thing she did with JY was to get in the pool\n\nhttps://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=solohell2&amp;no=3854&amp;exception_mode=recommend&amp;page=1\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nDong-Woo\n\nYJ is the same age as DW(32), but YJ doesn't sound old at all. DW keeps talking to Seulki in the 3rd person, and keep asking if he likes her despite her hinting at him to stop. He sounds like someone just back from the military.\n\nhttps://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=solohell2&amp;no=2946&amp;exception_mode=recommend&amp;page=2\n\nEvery time he refers to Seulki in the 3rd person like a kid(\"Did Seulgi sleep well?\"), any of my feelings left towards him is torn to pieces. He sounds much older than a middle aged guy. Why can't he just talk normal and tease each other back and forth?\n\nAs soon as he heard she studies piano at SNU(Harvard of Korea), instead of studying acting, he started rapidly blinking his eyes like a fish and unceasingly asking if she likes him.\n\nhttps://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=solohell2&amp;no=3557&amp;exception_mode=recommend&amp;page=1\n\nHe may have picked Nadine because she studied abroad and played a 'rich person sport'\n\nhttps://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=solohell2&amp;no=2979&amp;exception_mode=recommend&amp;page=2\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nYJ\n\nHe really has no interested in SE at all. He would 100% have gone to paradise with SE if he'd pick her, but he didn't.\n\nhttps://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=solohell2&amp;no=2990&amp;exception_mode=recommend&amp;page=1\n\nYJ clearly likes a wise and smart woman. He doesn't like 'young acting' people.\n\nhttps://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=solohell2&amp;no=3198&amp;exception_mode=recommend&amp;page=1\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nSE\n\nAt this point, YJ has already turned her down, that he has no interest in her. Even during dinner he told her he picked another girl following his heart. At this point it's becoming nuisance level as she called him to talk after dinner again.\n\nhttps://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=solohell2&amp;no=3391&amp;exception_mode=recommend&amp;page=1\n\nReduce SE's TV time! This is Singles Inferno, not my High School Crush Romance story!\n\nhttps://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=solohell2&amp;no=3401&amp;exception_mode=recommend&amp;page=1\n\nShe has relatively common looks, but takes a ton of camera time, and a lot of it is to put pressure on YJ. Reduce her time!\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nJY(Dex)\n\nWhat the heck is up with his hairstyle?\n\nhttps://gall.dcinside.com/mgallery/board/view/?id=solohell2&amp;no=3933&amp;exception_mode=recommend&amp;page=1",

I\u2019m not a fan of her perpetual puppy face expression either but it\u2019s quite infuriating to see people call her rude or boring etc bc of her response to DW.. do people not like having their boundaries respected.. He could have just made conversation about life in general but he kept asking questions like how do you feel about me, do you want to continue this with me etc etc and then sniding her for saying I don\u2019t know. How is \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 not a reasonable answer when asked about feelings towards somebody you\u2019ve barely known for two days..",

It\u2019s a pretty fun watch, it\u2019s like TGE but competitive! Unfortunately it\u2019s not fully subbed yet (only E1 so far) so it\u2019ll probably take some time, but definitely recommend",

            "comment": "IMO the most must-watch is Society Game, both seasons. Just so entertaining and a different set of heads rather than the usual variety people. You'll be surprised who you end up rooting for.\n\nAfter that, Time Hotel has come the closest. Bloody Game is a bit less cerebral (think like Genius season 2 squared) but the new season looks wild.\n\nTreasure Hunt is fantastic so far but only 1 episode is translated at present. Check back soon.",

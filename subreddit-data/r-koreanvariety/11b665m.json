His comments and his thoughts as an owner are hilarious. He is such a Kkondae hahaha",

It's still funny thou to see Lee Seo-jin finally becoming the \uc0ac\uc7a5\ub2d8 this time and how he's no longer at YYJ's beck and call. As Park Seo-jun had said, he's different this time around. \ud83d\ude06 Must have felt the pressure of being responsible in leading both the show and the resto this time around.\n\n&gt;!Actually, I'm still getting used to the changes that happened this time. Although Jung Yu-mi is still cooking (if making kimbap is considered one lol), I miss seeing her in the kitchen and being the head chef. Thou it's funny how they're teasing Choi Woo-shik over being an intern, I kinda feel bad for him. LSJ should still consider his experience in Youn's Stay! hahahaha!&lt;\n\nThis is also my first time watching a show with a BTS member on it so I don't have any expectations of V but he seems fitting with the cast just fine. I think it helps that he's friends with PSJ and CWS.\n\nOverall, just glad to watch a Na PD show again. I suddenly remember I'm still finding subbed episodes for Youn's Kitchen S1 and S2. \ud83e\udd72",

Yes, he can be pretty uptight and no jam since he's always taking this so seriously but I think they need him to be like that because they're running a legit business. I dunno if they watched previous seasons but the staff relies on him a lot. Looking forward to him being Jekyll and Hyde (as V had said in the preview lol) and his dynamics with Na PD as well this time around.",

He's one of the persons thats kinda hard to get along kind of persona and always complain but he really is what Na Pd describe of him as cold on the outside but warm-hearted inside. I wanna see how he manage the restaurant by watching the show. \n\nThis is just the first episode but I'm reminded of Coffee Friends and Hostel in Spain, on how Yoo Yeon Seok and Cha Seung Won are as the boss or as a leader of their team during those times. Yoo Yeon Seok giving out leaflets and promoting their shop and also how Cha Seung Won cares for his co-workers during their first day as well. I just missed the part when Yeon Seok encourages everyone and have a mantra before they start to open their cafe and there was nothing like it in this first episode. I can't help it but to compare. I also remembered that they're excited and anxious (waiting time for their first customer) in the first day of opening as well. Anyway Seo Jin maybe could have done this but it was edited out and not shown on the episode. That was just my rant on this episode. Also pasta and ramen are not the same. It's just an instant noodles, though still considered as noodles but they aren't the same. Though me thinks I could have also do the same with those cx who bought ramyeon too and just wanted to taste it. \ud83d\ude05\n\nBased on the interviewed I've watched from Na pd's channel, it seems like Woo Shik is a lovable person when meeting strangers. He's very friendly kind of vibe, getting along with customers and talking to them with their concerns. And such a happy pill to see. And Yumi is lovely here. The reason I'll be watching this is growth of Seo Jin, and the camaraderie amongst the staff. Also because of Choi Woo Shik as well as V and Yumi is here too just like the Summer Vacation that Yumi and CWS had done in the past. How I wish I could visit that place and hoping that they can preserve the beauty of the place eventhough tourists might possibly arise after airing the full episodes of the show.",

She was endearing, calming, and sometimes even a bit sassy, but that made her truly a pillar of strength and a comforting presence on the show. \n- Will mostly get downvoted for this but I found Seo Jin to be very unlikable. Even if it's \"for show\" or a \"variety show persona\", he just reminds me of a very stereotypical boomer mentality, my way or the high way, micromanager-type boss who's still living in the past.\n- Of course, \"boomers\" on variety shows can be charming too, but unfortunately, this isn't the case. Didn't understand the need for him to focus on \"hierarchy\" or \"creating competition\" within the team, it really destroyed any sense of \"healing element\" the show had before.\n- Balacar seems very picturesque and relaxing, it makes me want to visit! But it'll probably get very crowded after the show airs.\n- Tae Hyung seems like a fish out of water, I'm interested to see how he grows and whether he can fit in with the team. It's going to be even more interesting when Woo Shik joins for sure.\n- 200 pesos (~US$11) for two pieces of tteokbokki + a few fritters seems kinda pricey? Granted, they came all the way from Korea to Mexico, but since they said they want to expose more people to Korean food I feel like it could be more affordable.",

He also mentioned that V is the current young generation who doesn\u2019t really care about that boomer mentality and will show how he navigates this particular kind of \u2018boss\u2019. \n\nPart of it is also likely down to editing to make the show funny, more interesting and more relatable to viewers.

How did they expect to have any kind of a crowd for the grand opening with no advertising especially since the restaurant is new and somewhat in a secluded spot. At least hand out some fliers or something.  Unless this was just a part of the dramatic effect for the first episode.  Next week's episode seems to have sorted itself out.",

It really is about perspective, I think.",

He doesn't like to work too much and just do on his own tasks. He's just giving off that kind of vibe in that show. He doesn't like kids but eventually warmed up with them.",

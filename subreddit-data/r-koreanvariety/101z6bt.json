    "postText": "Sorry., I don't know how to title this post well and I hope this post doesn't break any rules..\n\nThere's a YT channel with YJS as the host.. There is at least one guest in every video., but the upload date is not scheduled I think.. They mostly do chatting.. The first video was uploaded on Nov 15, 2022.. Looks like this channel is managed by Antenna.. Every video has English subtitle..\n\nJust in case someone is interested:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@ddeunddeun](https://www.youtube.com/@ddeunddeun)",

What strikes me as interesting is YJS's perspective that the show format will not do well on TV (which i 100% absolutely disagree!)\n\nYJS seems like an old school enternatiner who has a very defined idea on what a TV show should be. He wants it to be well produced and perfect, which fits his perfectionist attitude and giving 100% on all his shows.\n\nHopefully once he sees this YT channel gain popularity, he'll be more open to these types of shows. Him being relaxed with his friends is always very entertaining!",

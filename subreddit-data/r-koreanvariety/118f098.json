As Agent H said, the winner was indeed unexpected \ud83e\udd2f\n\nOur updated weekly 'Physical: 100' [quest recap and summary](https://www.mykpopshows.com/physical-100) is up. If you click any of the contestants in the quest summaries, it will still lead to their contestant profile. We're happy and proud of the top 5 for making it far. We hope we can still see the contestants reunited in other variety shows and hopefully Netflix announces season 2 soon! \u2764\ufe0f",

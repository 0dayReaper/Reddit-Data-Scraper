I said it in the past that people should be posting in the SOTW or WQT that are made weekly, instead of making new ones that should be in there.  \nStarting tomorrow (Monday 1/30/2023), if I see any posts that I think should be in there, or reported to be in there, and should be....I'm removing your post and you can repost it in there.  \nI'm not sure if mods have the power to just move posts (I looked), but if I could, I'd just move it in there for you.  \nPrevious mods enforced this rule and I've been lax on it.",

Personally, I'm think almost everything will most likely be in the WQT post and not here.",

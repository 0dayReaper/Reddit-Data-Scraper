So that is 10 years of money that they are fighting for. \n\nThe mma guy was getting boos from the crowd and in the comments for picking a woman. \n\n1. this show has no woman/man separation. no weight classes. no steroid/ natural separation either. it'd be silly to suddenly call one of these unfair when all the contestants knew what they were getting in to before hand. wrestler vs civilian is fine. roider vs natural is fine. 40lbs + difference in weight is fine... but man vs woman isn't? people giving him a hard time for using knee on belly technique while the grapplers are putting locks on people and wrestlers are literally throwing their opponents around like they are ragdolls. \n\n2. the producers didn't do a perfect job but they did try to vary the games to lean in to different strengths.\n\n&gt; the first game was all about being light weight and lean, terrible for the big bodybuilders, wrestlers and such. \n\n&gt;the ball fighting stage A more for agility and stage B for more brute strength and grappling technique. \n\n&gt;the sand carrying was really all around as you can get in terms of what you need to be successful. dayoung the stunt woman MVP for coming in with that perfect bridge buliding\n\n&gt; the torso lifting for the resurrection round is more for lean lightweight people as well.\n\nthe ship moving in the latest game obviously designed for more strength and size. 10 years worth of money on the line and people are going to pick what's advantageous to the current game at hand. so easy to act virtuous and righteous just watching the show but when you really need the cash and it comes down to it I doubt many people will act different from the ones on the show.\n\nalso easy for us with no pressure at all in our homes looking from third perspective from all camera angles to see better ways of moving the ship. these people are there on the ground with not much time for prep. saying they have no brain cells for not having better strategy i doubt people here will fair that much better in practice. also, i bet some contestants did think of some other ideas but it'd be hard to speak out and suddenly change the plan when everyone is in motion. \n\n\n**TLDR silly long rant from me**",

As long as he plays by the rules that's fine. What I disagree with was his clown attitude before and during the match. That was something.",

He was gonna win everybody know that so the showboating was what rubbed people the wrong way  \n \\-The wrestler suplex the prison guard on his neck was also viewed as overkill but at least it was on a guy that is similar in build  \n\n\nWhat the MMA guy did wasn't unfair and wasn't against any rule but everybody with eyes saw it as unsportsmanlike/disrespectful/scummy.

If you rush the ball to play tag, chances are you will fumble it and it goes down to grappling anyway. The few that got away got caught in the end due to the arena being too small to really play tag on.\n\nIt's true that the games had been diverse so far and only the first and 3rd quest are heavily reliant on strength.",

If it was truly even, then adjust what they are lifting for size and capacity. Ie the torso lifting one was good and allowed anyone with mental fortitude to succeed and you could see that with who won it. It was also mainly focussed on brute upper body strength (male based abilities) and not other physical aptitudes like flexibility, balance, lower body strength, mental fortitude, fine motor skills like archery (where more females would succeed). I think they should have either made a game that was fairer for women to compete in (ie that also had games that required female specific body strengths) or  just make an all female and all male game.",

                            "comment": "I think you misunderstood the whole point of sexism. If it was aimed at all body types, why the over-emphasis on male type strengths like brute physical strength, particularly in the last few games which hinged on winning. There was nothing for flexibility which is a strength of women, and high emphasis on brute upper body strength which is the strength of boys. The knee pinning on her solar plexis was unnecessary and out of line esp since he was an MMA fighter taking on a body builder (seasoned fighter with many other skillsets to win against someone who shows their muscles aesthetically for their sport). He likely could have won without pinning her on the solar plexis so why the extreme aggression like that. He was clearly acting extremely aggressively and looking at the context i wouldn't be surprised if it was due to her sex as a woman. You could see from everyone else booing and going quiet that it was out of line and unnecessary.",

Women and males can participate. The games revolve around flexibility, balance, endurance of abdominal pain, will power, and extreme endurance racing. Males continuously fall short as they are built for brute physical strength and not these particular sex based abilities. The women constantly talk out loud and mock the males by calling them weak and refuse to pick them for their teams, leaving many males together in teams that find it harder to compete in these sex based skillsets. In particular, during a 1:1 balance game the woman (a pro gymnast specialising in balance beams) deliberately  kicks her male competitor (a dancer) repeatedly in the crotch, even though it's not needed to win the game as she has clearly better balance skills and would have won in any case. Are the games fair for both sexes and is it an encouraging environment for males to compete in?",

The latter is still an advantage over those without T, but not the same. Assuming she did use steroids. Secondly, you seem to be deliberately missing the whole point of what i first stated - the game was set up for majority male physical skills. Therefore, the game was rigged for males from the start. You need to read what I first stated properly.",

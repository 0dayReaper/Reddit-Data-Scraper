So SBS will let MITS competes against Adventure by Accident (Kian's new show) &amp; Boss in the Mirror, while RM is going to be competing against 1N2D &amp; King of Mask Singer again. I think MITS could put a good fight if they get masters from abroad teaching them - like sk soccer players etc. I'm not sure about RM but who knows? I always like good competitions btwn shows that can improve the qualities of all shows which most of the times are good for the viewers.",

She has been kinda crowned as one of the next in line for the nation top main MCs. She has good track records &amp; image among viewers esp among the women. Simon D &amp; Song Mino also have quite good young followings. Pani Bottle - another person that will travel with Kian &amp; Sieon - seems to be a famous youtuber as well in SK\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlenty commenters on the news about the time slot change said that they usually like to watch RM then follow it with 1N2D afterwards  - bcoz they have consecutive broadcast time - it would be interesting to see whether RM current viewers would move to watch Kian's show realtime or whether they'll just stick with MITH in SBS or even move to KBS's Boss in the Mirror. Will also be interesting to see what the loyal viewers that now watch in realtime RM then 1N2D will choose to view in realtime btwn RM or 1N2D. Note too that for RM seems like it just aldy been accepted that the show doesn't need to rely too much on the ratings bcoz the show is good on ott platforms so peeps don't really watch the show realtime; they watched it on demand later usually.",

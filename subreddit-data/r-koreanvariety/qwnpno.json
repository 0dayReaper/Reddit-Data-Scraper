This whole controversy is stupid.\n\nJong Kook isn't doing the tests just because. It's to do with image. Ignoring it does him no good. But doing the tests will convince who don't understand these things that he's clean. Jong Kook isn't natural. This is obvious to anyone with any knowledge or experience in bodybuilding. \n\nHowever this dude on his case about it is frankly being weird. Jong Kook can safely use PEDs. Are there still risks? Sure. But I'm not sure why this dude is on his case about it. It's not like JK is competing. And even most athletes are on PEDs despite not being caught. This man is a singer and bodybuilder hobbyist. Why get on his case?\n\nThis thing is incredibly random.",

The problem lies in their culture and Internet mob mentality. \n\nThe media is also certainly to blame. Western media isn't great either but imagine how silly it would be if CNN or FOX made a segment about how a South Korean YouTuber claimed The Rock was probably not natural on air.",

A lot of celebrities have had their career ruined for less. So just shrugging it off is not an option, especially for someone of his status.\n\nBut as someone who is very interested in sports and bodybuilding and know the doping test process, him doing the tests now only show he has no drugs in him recently. But then again I know KJK's almost obsessive love for the gym through watching korean shows, so I know he's fully natural. It's not like KJK suddenly got muscly at his age, he's been like that for decades. If anything I think he's gotten skinnier. \n\ntl;dr KJK has to make a big expensive (but slightly useless) show of how natural he is because of how the public will see him + legal issues",

Celebs that had dark history can redeem themselves through their work. For example, RDJ and Justin Bieber. At least they can continue their work through varies platform. \n\nHowever, for Korean celebrities, people seem to value their reputation more than their work, if they get exposed to a scandal, they are immediately cancelled. For example, Gill from Leessang, rapper MC Mong, singer Kim Gun-mo and recently actor Kim Seon-ho. They got cancelled and almost have no platform to recover their public image.\n\nI believe that is why KJK is mad because of Greg. If KJK choose to stay silence, the news spread, he will become a 'drug abuser' which in Korean is a felony afaik, and he will be cancelled from his shows, his product endorsement, basically become a faud for the rest of his life.\n\nFor me, while 'freedom of speech' is a good thing, it does not always bring good result, sometimes it comes with consequences. Greg as an influencer or internet celebrity, he needs to be careful about his 'choice of words' and take the responsibility of whatever the backlash he receive. \n\nA more extreme case, would you defend a guy who comes to his ex-girlfriend's wedding and gives a speech about how great their sex life was, and get kicks out while yelling 'what about my freedom of speech'?",

He isn't going to sue you if you made a random comment on the internet. You aren't a public figure like Greg who has 1M+ subscribers on youtube, so your opinion is obviously less impactful. \n\n\nLet's provide a hypothetical situation where KJK made a video claiming something false about you. This then is seen by your employer who decided to fire you because your employer considered you to bring negative publicity to the company because the video has 5M+ views. Would you not take legal action to protect yourself from someone else's opinion?",

I'm guessing off cycle. But I remember seeing that and wondering why he'd have that on TV.\n\nLike even without that, no one sensible who knows bodybuilding is gonna believe he's natural. It's like saying Chris Hemsworth or The Rock are clean.\n\nThe issue is the stigma around PEDs. If someone isn't in sports, it should be a non-issue. People make a big deal out of it because when it turns out someone is not natural when they obviously aren't, they feel betrayed. People can responsibly take PEDs. Let them. They're not in sports.\n\nEven actors like Rock or Hemsworth carry on with this bullshit because they know admittance would just cause controversy. And that's in America. Korea is likely a lot worse with how important image is the to the public.",

With PRT, you gradually amp up your workout volume\u2014weight, reps, and sets\u2014as your strength and endurance improve.\n&gt;\n&gt; This constant challenging builds muscle and keeps you away from plateaus where you stop making gains. (See \"Working on a PRT program.\") In fact, a recent meta-analysis published in Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise reviewed 49 studies of men ages 50 to 83 who did PRT and found that subjects averaged a 2.4-pound increase in lean body mass.\n\n\nWouldn't that be consistent with what KJK was doing or am I misunderstanding PRT?\n\n\nEDIT: Damn downvoted for asking legit question lol.",

Seriously, go to the gym and do 50 sets of 8-12 reps across your exercises before leaving the gym. See how long it takes you to finish the workout and how fatigued you'll be after. A typical, tough workout is 20-24 sets that takes 60-90 min to finish. You're doubling that with KJK's workout. \n\nWe can see in his videos he's not just half assing or doing light weight, either. These are working weight sets and looks like RPE 7-8 with very minimal rest in between sets. Mark, the American training partner, said he puked the first time he worked out with KJK. That is totally believable because basically no one works out like that regularly. Even professional bodybuilders don't do 50 set workouts. If they did, they would break it up into two sessions because you'd simply be too tired to complete it.",

It has happened and it will happen as long as the person that is being the target seeks for action and the law finds it appropriate. \n\nHowever in this case, what I mean by shutting up those people is by proving Greg was wrong so those that are currently siding with him and taking snipe shot at kjk would feel slapped in their face.\n\nAdditionally.

But his whole credence and his principle is to be natural and attain the result that he aim for from purely working out and without unnatural substance. \n\nHis popularity and standing as a celebrity and an entertainer are strongly influenced by his principled and steadfast personality which is why he has been one of the most influential entertainer/ celebrity till this day in terms of brand ranking (consistently ranking at the top among the likes of YJS)\n\nSo obviously this accusation is far heftier when aimed at Kho taking all this into consideration. \n\nEdit: plus point, his YT channel is also premised on the fact that you can get the body you want simply by working out hard so this accusation also goes along his very channel integrity.",

Anyway, just cos most bodybuilders and fitness models are enhanced, it doesnt mean that attaining a good natural physique is unnattainable(false dichotomy). People just need to understand the actual standard for naturals. Soooo many fitness youtubers have been claiming natty and were later exposed and admitted the truth.",

Now if you were to ask a physician for their opinion on whether someone aged 45 had T levels of \\~9ng/ml was on HRT, they'd likely say yes considering that's beyond the 99th percentile. Would suing the doctor for their opinion make sense here? \n\nI have nothing against KJK... knowing him, despite those T levels, I'd still probably believe he's natty if he claims to be just because I see him as someone with a very strong sense of morality. But it shouldn't be black and white just because it ended up hurting his reputation.",

While Greg did use the standard loopholes of \"my opinion\" and whatnot, they also pointed out that some of his statements were straightforward enough to be considered as him flat out accusing KJK. In reality, this lawsuit won't do anything except make it so Greg can't come to Korea. Which it doesn't really seem like he was planning on anyway. It's more about KJK standing up for himself against malicious commenters. Which is great. \n\n In this day and age of social media, malicious comments are a real and dangerous problem, and need to be treated as such. And for those worried about censorship and freedom of speech, just don't be a dickbag. It's literally not that hard to not type hateful comments. As someone once said \"Freedom of speech protects you from the Governmet, not the consequences of being an asshole.\"",

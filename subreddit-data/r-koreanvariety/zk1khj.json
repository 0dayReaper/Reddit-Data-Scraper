            "comment": "IMO, If we look from the production team's perspective, i think They're definitely planning to do it but with the delays &amp; everything, they will need to deal with massive reorganizing i.e logistics, casts schedule, broadcast time slots. So it makes sense for those other shows which are still on schedule and on plan to run first.\n\nPretty sure pushing a show's production when half/more of the original plans had to be scraped is not a good content. Why risk it &amp; get cancelled for good?\n\nStay hopeful, if new season pops out let's rejoice &amp; enjoy \u263a\ufe0f. If no season is out, new shows with fresh ideas &amp; casts aren't bad either.\n\nAs long as the production team is still running, we'll have shows.",

Of course Na PD can cast someone new (as he did when Seung-gi &amp; Kyu-hyun enlisted), but it seems to me that it\u2019s a combination of logistics &amp; member schedules that\u2019s been causing delays. I still hope NJTTW will get a season 9, even if it\u2019s next year. It was the show that got me hooked on k-variety and I still think it\u2019s unparalleled when it comes to cast chemistry &amp; comedy. I would also settle for a new show with the same cast.",

            "comment": "As much as I love njttw, I have to admit that I think the show is over and I don't think they'll have another new season for it. What makes me so sure about this is the hit of Earth arcade and the Caterers, which basically njttw female version for the former and njttw with different cast for the latter. Nevertheless, we may still get the spin-off (yes I'm talking about that Kenya giraffe hotel). And tbh I prefer the production team to make something new and fresh with njttw casts instead of asking for a new season.\n\nAfter all these years, I realized that I really am a big fan of Na PD's show. So regardless of what show it is, as long as it's from Na pd and the team, I'll look forward to it. I put my trust in them.",

And then there's Kang's Kitchen which I hope they do a finale for too during Mino's discharge ala Kyuhyun in S3. \n\nIf not then we can still see them in Channel Full Moon/15ya, but I hope they give them a heck of  a swan song series.",

Kind of annoying how they don\u2019t give ANY updates at all even after it\u2019s been a week after the finale. Wish they would just rip the bandaid off and let us know instead of just not saying anything at all..",

What's the point of the show then? What's the difference between Pink Lie or any RomCom K-drama?",

What's the difference between Pink Lie or any RomCom K-drama?\n\nImagine coming to the show and finding out that out of the five guys none of them is your person. You can either sulk throughout the two weeks or have fun with the best option on there. You know it's not gonna work out long term, but for the time being it's fine. We have seen what Daon, Haneul and Hanui had to go through. They had a hard time on there and ended up with nothing.\n\nI don't think Chansol was on the joke tho, he seemed pretty sincere (slightly demanding &amp; jealous) in some scenes. Dahae meanwhile was a poster girlfriend throughout the show (funny, supportive, unproblematic and nonconfrontational). If someone looks too good to be true, they most likely aren't. I get where Dahae was coming from, but I feel a bit bad for Chansol.",

It is more of a show for real people looking for marriage rather than influencers. They only spend a few days together so it's easier for people with regular jobs to take a week off work. \n\nThe format is totally different and might take some time to get used to but i highly recc that if you are looking for a show with real connections. \n\nIt won't have insane visuals like other shows tho, and the avg age skews older. \n\nEach season is only 6-10 eps so you get through them quickly.",

This is more apparent with Terrace House as a lot of them were from the same agencies as the previous housemates and so on. But anyway, dating shows are not that faked/stage/etc. though. It's just that certain events or plotlines are encouraged by the producers, though ya it's usually not as obvious or as known.\n\nIf you want more raw or like more real dating shows, look into **Ainori Love Wagon (Asian Journey and African Journey on Netflix)**, **REA(L)OVE** and **I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO (/r/IamSolo)**. With those you can see production staff often and like the cameras, the setups, the meta for the show, et cetera. It's a fun time still.\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iyso9ql/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iz8ayph/**\n\n---\n\nThere was finally a modern Korean drama version of **UnREAL with Rachel or Shiri Appleby**. In UnREAL they show you how shows like The Bachelor and so on are produced, lol.\n\nThat Kdrama is called **Love is for Suckers** (has Lee Da-hee and Choi Si-won), it just finished two weeks ago. Kingdom of Love 2 (the dating reality show inside Love is for Suckers) is mainly based around probably I Am Solo and so on, like if you watch I Am Solo you'll see familiar stuff, references, et cetera.\n\nIf you want to skip the drama and go straight behind the curtain for how dating shows are made, start at Episode 5/6 as that's when they actually begin the Kingdom of Love 2 dating show, lol.\n\nCheck these threads for more info on where to watch Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/ https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zlml4b/ramyun_chill_episode_5_finale_221214/j06e2lh/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/znemtw/i_fell_in_love_with_korean_dating_shows/j0h5xw3/",

No that would be ridiculous.\n\nI've also watched a lot of American dating shows and they're more fake, with producers intentionally causing drama for views and telling contestants what to do. \n\nOnly very few dating shows are \"real.\"",

    "postText": "# Description\n\n&gt; Love Catcher is a show featuring a group of men and women coming together for love or money. In this event, men and women who do not know each other will live in the same house. But before moving into the house, participants must choose between two identities: 'Love Catcher' or 'Money Catcher'. Later, 'Money Catcher' was seen forming sincere relationships with other 'Love Catchers'. On the other hand, 'Money Catcher' can win almost $50,000 if they can become a couple with 'Love Catcher' at the end of the show. When making romantic advances, there's an added mood of caution as participants can only guess who's there for love or money. \n\n# Panel\n\n* Jang Do Yeon\n* Joo Woo Jae\n* Jun Hyun Moo\n* Gabee\n* Kim Yo Han\n\n# Cast\n\nMale Participants\n* Park Yong Ho - [@hoho_dragon](https://www.instagram.com/hoho_dragon/)\n* Cho Seong Beom - [@laul_sb](https://www.instagram.com/laul_sb/)\n* Park Jung Hyun - [@junghyuniiii](https://www.instagram.com/junghyuniiii/)\n* Kim Yoon Soo Ro - [@kimyunsuro](https://www.instagram.com/kimyunsuro/)\n* Kwak Tae Hyeok - [@kwak_taehyeok](https://www.instagram.com/kwak_taehyeok/)\n\nFemale Participants\n* Kim Hyo Jin - [@h3_1o](https://www.instagram.com/h3_1o/)\n* Hwang Soo Ji - [@t_110771](https://www.instagram.com/t_110771/)\n* Lee Yu Jeong - [@ririyujeong](https://www.instagram.com/ririyujeong/)\n* Choi Tae Eun - [@c.taeeun](https://www.instagram.com/c.taeeun/)\n* Hong Seung Yeon - [@applemang0o](https://www.instagram.com/applemang0o/)\n\n\n# Episode Links\n\n|Info|Link|Notes|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|RAW|[Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uP41137xW?p=5)||\n|Stream|[VIU](https://www.viu.com/ott/sg/en-us/vod/467889/Love-Catcher-in-Bali)|^(ENG SUB)|\n|Softsub|[Download](https://link.emediaarts.net/lovecatcherinbali/lcib-episode-5)|^(ENG SUB)|\n\n# Previous Discussions\n\n|Episode(s)|\n|:-:|\n|[01](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yyjiu2/love_catcher_in_bali_e01_221118/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [02](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z487z3/love_catcher_in_bali_e02_221125/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [03](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zafwqf/love_catcher_in_bali_e03_221202/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [04](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zn8wt2/love_catcher_in_bali_e04_221216/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)|\n\n___\nTHE DISCUSSION BELOW MAY CONTAIN ***SPOILERS***",

But ya she seems into Yoonsuro and there's like photos or interactions of them in Instagram or something.\n\nSuji is a bit confusing sometimes, but since she's unlikely to be a money catcher then ya it's probably her preferring more explicit forms of love/adoration/etc. Some people are just like that, hell I'm like that because way back then I was super dense and so I didn't know that certain girls (that I thought were out of my league) liked me, and so I also like it to be clear or at least less ambiguous.\n\nBecause no way in hell did anybody with a right mind think Seongbeom was being good with the aegyo talk, it was just so weird, lol. Like he always talks to her as if she's a baby and so on. Like Yongho does it too since she's the maknae or youngest one. \n\nBut like Seongbeom is full saccharine on purpose and it's obvious that it's kinda perfunctory. Though ya it'll be different for the housemates since they'll be thinking of other things instead of watching it in a semi-omniscient edit like we have right now.\n\nYes, Yongho and Hyojin is the ultimate ship but fam, I don't think it'll be real since Yongho is somehow too enamored with Suji's looks instead of like Hyojin's personality (and also visuals). Even Hyojin is like hurt by how blatant Yongho's focus is, lmao.",

But the preview show a lot of sign that TE's gonna be eliminated I'd like to think that it's just PD nim trolling us, as there's no way the cast think that she's Money\n\nBtw Why do they keep that elimination bs i don't understand, I hate it so much it doesn't help anything at all, just for some drama. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY????\n\nI love YH-HJ so muchhh pls talk more pls fall in love you are perfect for each other. YH keeps telling ppl that he likes someone with chemistry but all i see is he fell for SJ look, that's what i think. The conversation between them is just YH keep flirting obviously and SJ tried to 'flirt' back to keep him an option, i don't see it as natural at all, a bit force. I think SJ is Money btw.\n\nSJ-SB omg that shit is just cringe, hella cringe. SB man, you have to be Money and also horrendous at acting because there's no way you're that cringe. I watched a lot of dating show and those 'I miss you' and the whole 'I'm full' lines are just next level of cringe. It's not the content that is cringe, SB himself and the way he said it is just cringe.\n\nJH-YJ have little to no chemistry, they keep feeling each other out and both are too passive, i don't blame YJ though she stepped up this ep but JH, man have no rizz at all does he want to keeping cooking only for the rest of the show?\n\nI don't know why usually i don't like ppl who keep expressing their love one-sided even though it's pretty clear that it will not be recipocated but I love SY. She's class, i don't think SR feel uncomfortable that much, she keeps the balance very well and not overbearing. I hope she finds happiness in this show or not.",

Just like previous seasons the cast usually pick someone that\u2019s not their interest + maybe MC.\n\nBut according to that logic, my no.1 candidate to be eliminated would be SB (TH too but he came later so unlikely) for men and SY/YJ for women",

SJ who has only sent him a text message ONCE? SJ who avoided him like a plague when he did NOTHING wrong?\n\neither i have misunderstood the definition of \u201cconnection\u201d or YH is really deluding himself. don\u2019t get me wrong, i am rooting for YH to find true love but until dude can be honest with himself, there\u2019s no way he is able to do that. regardless if HJ might be a MC, personality-wise and the so-called \u201cconnection\u201d that he is looking for, HJ seems like a better fit than SJ. \n\nbut the heart wants what the heart wants aye? hopefully the direction of the wind changes in the next episode judging by the preview.",

It's highly unlikely that she'll be voted off.\n\nAnd yes, Yongho and Hyojin ship needs to sail properly.\n\nSuji is possibly not a money catcher, btw. Like Taeeun is a money catcher for sure and then Seongbeom is like 90% money catcher. And then Hyojin or Seungyeon could be the last of the 3. Or just Hyojin if you think the spoilers are true.\n\nYa Seongbeom forced his words so much, idk if Suji noticed that or what, like it was so crazy, rofl.\n\nSeongbeom is a rapper or somebody in media btw. His voice has potential, if he works on his technical skills it'll be fine. LAUL(\ub77c\uc6b8) is Seongbeom, this is the music video for Sorry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zle8pqZ-6Pw\n\nAnyway ya, Seongbeom is just too much with Suji, lmao.\n\nJeonghyeon is probably there to promote his restaurant/etc. But you never know. \n\nLike Tae I from EXchange/Transit Love 2 maybe for sure fell for Choi Yihyun (the one that looks like \ub178\uc81c/no:ze) and then he also just chilled with his caf\u00e9, lol.",

SJ-YH seemed to have a better connection here during the swimming date. Then suddenly after no texting, no real conversation, SB came onto her even stronger with the whole \u2018i miss you\u2019 thingy and now she liked it? Like wth it didn\u2019t seem genuine to me.\n\nI also don\u2019t understand her ignoring YH after 1v1 date. The only thing i can think of is that she\u2019s playing push and pull with YH because she knows for sure it\u2019s gonna work on him. \n\nRemember during first few eps SJ said she\u2019s conflicting because she thought YH is Money? YH in my eyes is so transparent most of the cast thinks he\u2019s Love besides SJ and TE. And you know already what TE is. Maybe SJ is faking her \u2018innocent\u2019 image for the show because she\u2019s Money so that\u2019s why she\u2019s suspicious of YH? And SJ is the first one of the cast mentioned Money and Love catcher too, i think.\n\nWho knows, maybe SJ is just that type of ppl, truly naive and have no good judgement of character, she\u2019s still young tbh. But for me she\u2019s Money.",

Sooji had no clue that photo was his. I was puzzled at why Sooji was upset with Yongho when he got back. Then I realised that she only realised Hyojin went with Yongho when they all returned from the dates. She may have thought that his photo hint (that she did not recognise) was targeted at Hyojin, and thought he wanted for Hyojin to pick him. I think his actions always make her confused. Like day 2, he didn't pick her for photoshoot, and on several occasions he was always moving away from her. She also made him (and only him) coffee and he let SB drink it!!!&lt; Why wouldn't she be confused.\n* I found it so fortuitous that Taeeun asked Yongho &gt;!the exact same question that Hyojin asked him on the boat and somehow by chance Taeeun made him realise what Hyojin wanted to tell him.!&lt;\n* I also feel bad for Seungyeon &gt;!having to go on a date with someone who isn't going to consider her. But I'm so puzzled that to her, the date went well and she likes him even more. Girl, you deserve better.. Sadly her only confidante Yujeong is too nice and only tells her what she wants to hear. Yongho at least had Taeeun knocking some sense into him. And! Even when she thought SR is MC, she was still happy and hopeful? I wish I had that kind of optimism in my life. !&lt;\n* I know people will question why Sooji &gt;!picked Yujeong's photo but it looks like she just eeny miny moe-d it since she thought YH &amp; SB are gone. And anyway thanks to her Yujeong gets to go on a date with JH, which YJ had wanted. !&lt;",

Wait it's only really Seungyeon left since Taeeun and maybe say Yujeong are locked with other people.\n\nAnyway, Suji probably just likes things to be more clear than they are right now. Unfortunately people like Yongho are timid and so on because they know they don't really compare to some other people, and so that lack of confidence is why he's a bit hesitant to be more forward.\n\nFor Seungyeon ya, it's sad that people keep pursuing those that don't like them back, but it's the heart, lol. It is a dating show though and so some of them are forced to stay like that as otherwise the mood and so on will be ruined. It's actually surprising that she's held on (in other dating shows sometimes the girls will need to take a break for a while) but not really since she said it herself that she's got a lot of pride/etc. when it comes to competing.\n\nSuji is probably not a money catcher by process of elimination and rumors/spoilers.\n\nAs in the money catcher for sure is Taeeun and then Seongbeom is like 90% money catcher. And then Hyojin or Seungyeon could be the last of the 3. Or just Hyojin if you think the spoilers are true.\n\nAnd ya Suji's choice actually finally gave Yujeong the chance to be with Jeonghyeon again and so that was like a good thing for them since they're a bit sidelined.",

Also HJ saw the guy she like (HW) keen on YJ (and even said he made breakfast for her/the person he was interested in) and she basically backed off until they were paired for a random date that she had no choice in even though she got all 4 votes\u2026 \n\nAnd HJ (and HW) still ended up getting a lot of hate for that compared to SY who is making all these comments about wanting to break his firm ground etc. \n\nAlso I agree the HS2 went about it respectfully and  in a pretty fair way. Compare that to Eden 2 and how Soomin acts omg. I think where SY resembles that a little is yes she wanted that pic first but then she made the comment that TE wanted it so she was even more sure it was SR so it seemed like she was waiting for the confirmation to steal the signal date. Not necessarily the case but the optics just looked bad esp paired with her comments throughout. \n\nSo yeah I kinda think there\u2019s a way to go about competing but why people are calling out SY\u2019s actions as weird is that for some people, it doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s being as respectful or considerate of others.",

And that maybe why it works for me, us viewers saw a lot of behind the scenes/ interviews/ girls talks so we may feel more uncomfortable.\n\nBefore this ep i thought SR was Money (along with SJ and SB), so i thought he was keeping SY as an option, but after the MC reveal and the preview i think he has a lot of respect for her. I still like him more with TE though.",

She's pretty young compared to the rest of the cast too so I think she has time to learn from her mistakes without it impacting her too much later. \n\nParaphrasing what Jin Kyung said on Single's Inferno, \"there are certain things in life you can achieve with hard work and determination, jobs and things like that, but relationships with people, even if you work hard, you won't always get good results.\" Most people understand this idea but when it's in the heat of the moment, caught up in the show's antics, it must be harder to think it's over until the show actually ends. Still, SooRo has tried so many times to let her down gently so unless it's a desperate Money Catcher play, I really hope she has more self-worth. Though, with the preview, it seems like things are only going to get worse for her so ughh. Either Soo Roo's also a Money Catcher like Tae Eun (if Tae Eun does switch and he doesn't, imagine the drama!) or more likely that he took her words at the massage date seriously and doesn't want to reject Seungyeon's feelings, even if he can't accept them, which makes the whole situation even more frustrating honestly.",

Heli-tours are usually pretty short (15 to 30 minutes).  Even with the shopping stop over (SJ showed a photo of what she had found at the shops to SB after her return to LC House), it couldn't have taken that long.\n\nJH-YJ also makes sense: The date was him cooking, so there wasn't a need to have a separate meal from the date.\n\nTE-SB makes absolutely no sense...they were on the beach just below LC House.  They didn't have to deal with traffic, cars, or anything like that.  They ***should*** have been the first to return, by a wide margin.  What the heck were they doing until after sundown?\n\nSR-SY kinda makes sense...they had at least three locations to shoot (meet in the garden at the massage place, the couples massage, and then the jacuzzi/hot tub outdoors).  I could see that extending into the late afternoon.  But the location looked to be close to LC House, so there can't have been *that* much traffic.\n\nYH-HJ coming back significantly later than everyone seems...weird.  And YH made a comment while setting the dinner table that he already had dinner, but would still sit with everyone while they ate.  If that's true, it would explain why they were so late, but it also means we're missing some footage from YH-HJ's dinner.  If YH-HJ spent that much time together, and YH **still** sent his evening message to SJ, I'm even more curious how the dinner went between YH-HJ before returning to LC House.",

The fact that she knew who he wanted and didn't care at all. \n\nYJ was trying to say to JH \"i wanted to pick you anyway, but i was last, and fate still put us together\" but instead it came off like \"i had no choice and no one else wanted you either\" \ud83d\ude05 but it's good she clarified a little later.\n\nSY... maybe don't waste your time talking abt your #1 rival on your hard earned date w her almost bf??? SR came off like a love seeing how considerate he was of TE... wouldn't he be more open to SY if he were money?\n\nOmg the chopper date was by far the best one. But in terms of romantic potential it was probably the spa date or the cooking date. \n\nLol i feel like TE doesnt like SJ that much based on her advice to YH that he should explore his other options. \n\nSY's sweater is so impractical \ud83d\ude02 why are the sides fully cut off \n\nI think it's only the 3 MCs that get a secret night!\n\nOmg i thought the 3rd MC was SR!!! \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31 i guess we were right all along that TE looked like a money. \n\nI forgot that they still needed to vote 1 or 2 people out! TE looks so nervous! I think they'll pick SB or TH for the men... they might pick SY just bc no one is really interested in her. That's what happened to girl JM last season. They'll have the men vote for a woman and the women vote for a man right?\n\nExcited for next week!!!",

They did it with The Secret X (\u673a\u667a\u7684\u604b\u7231) too.\n\n**Chinese version of Love Catcher, The Secret X (\u673a\u667a\u7684\u604b\u7231)**, Episode 1 from iQIYI Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTj-dJkp8o\n\nFam, from way back then I've watched so much Big Brother and other reality shows where people get voted off in like a survival/tournament manner. So tiring. And like this has no place in dating shows because wtf? It's like predictable or a popularity contest and so on too.\n\nLike come on bruh.",

So for the final vote, you had no idea if they opted to stay or if they switched after being outed. \n\nSame applies to an MC. You get a Princess Bride-esque showdown of \"you know im MC so I obviously have to switch, but because of that , I can stay as MC. But since you're thinking that process yourself, obviously I have to switch, which means...\"",

I get the panel and others could see and respect her courage and I felt the same way up until when she told SR \u201cthat\u2019s why I told you to stay\u201d but a lot of her actions and comments this episode was a bit meh to me. No one is paired up yet and she can pursue him but if he\u2019s obviously told her he wants to focus on TE, and she\u2019s kind of guilting him by saying she would cry if he told her to stop or that he only has TE in his heart, felt a bit emotionally manipulative to me.

Chae Hee from Eden 2 is actually delusional and a lot worse than SY (so far)  but I truly do not get these ppl who continue pursuing others who are clearly not interested / clearly rejected them.\n\nChae hee from Eden 2 is delusional because she keeps twisting the guy she's into's words/actions so that even when he's rejecting her AGAIN she somehow thinks he's interested.\n\nWhereas here we have SY who admits that SR hasn't given her any mixed signals. He's been clear that TE is the only one he's interested in but somehow SY likes him even more now??\n\nIt makes me feel like SY's pursuit is just for the purpose of winning, and SR's feelings are basically immaterial to her. Does she even see him as a person, or just a prize to be won? (unless SY is MC and  if SR is LC he is the prize, literally lolol)\n\nAlso her saying \"I'm gonna do what you advised &amp; follow my feelings but if you tell me not to get in the way, I'll cry\" is manipulative. So only she's allowed to express her feelings, but he's not allowed to express his?",

As umm, like I mean she's not Taeeun or Hyojin, lol.\n\nBut ya it's truly sad for Seungyeon cuz I actually grew to like her (visuals), especially during the photoshoot date. She has nice dimples when she smiles and unfortunately some people in dating shows will either pursue the hot girl (Taeeun) or the classic pretty girl (Hyojin), not so much the kawaii (usually shorter than others) girl who's often more plain or less striking.\n\nRight now the money catchers are Taeeun and probably Seongbeom. And then it seems like Seungyeon is the third one. But again, sometimes the edits are random (on purpose). It's likely Hyojin is the last of the 3 if the rumors are true.\n\nTry watching Love Catcher Season 2 if you want to see how the concept of love catcher and money catcher really be, it's considered the best by a lot of the fans.\n\n---\n\nLove Catcher Season 2 was subbed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/dcbekl/love_catcher_season_2_e01_190822/.

I\u2019m not surprised TE picked to be a MC only bc she\u2019s much older than most of the male contestants, so she probably truly thought she wouldn\u2019t find love but then she did. Her and SR are just so cute together they are like magnets to each other it\u2019s honestly so cute, esp their matching outfits that was by mistake. I\u2019m rooting for them. A lot of people are worried TE is gonna go home bc of the trailer but I think she\u2019s only being focused on bc her identity is revealed.\n\nI actually don\u2019t understand why SY like SR they barley have any interactions with each other since him and TE have been locked in since day one. But go her ig \ud83d\ude2d. That room didn\u2019t help with her crush on SR and it gave her hope that just isnt there, I hope she can move on but I doubt that since no in the house likes her. I would even go as far to say she might just be voted out of the house. Bc I think her problem is that she isn\u2019t trying to talk to any of the other guys and she\u2019s so focused on someone who doesn\u2019t like her. So she has no connection with anybody else so she could come off as a MC. At the beginning it was fine that she liked SR bc everyone is starting to get to know each other but know she\u2019s chasing after someone who doesn\u2019t want her. And it\u2019s coming off as desperate and sad low-key. And if I was on this show and the guy I liked doesn\u2019t even open my message to him while IN FRONT OF ME yeah I\u2019m gonna pack it up and just abandon that crush bc that\u2019s beyond embarrassing.

She previously never texted SR. \n\nOn day 2, they revealed their age and SY still didn\u2019t text SR. It was late at night after the texting when they spoke because they realised they are same age. Day 3 was the girls solo Yoga outing and Hyojin said she guessed Sooro is interested in Taeeun and Seungyeon. And then all of the sudden when they got home, Seungyeon announced to her roommates that she has decided on Sooro (when they only starting talking the night before).\n\nSeungyeon may have been encouraged by Hyojin\u2019s opinion. But like Sooro said, they only became friendly because they are same age friends, not because he was interested. Day 4 was the awkward canoe and they still haven\u2019t talked much. But Day 5 she was still persistent.\n\nI agree with you! I wished she tried to speak more with others. She just made her choice after speaking once with Sooro when previously she did have interests in the other guys but never got to chat with them too..",

            "comment": "3 quick thoughts in addition to what has already been said:\n\n1/ maybe the producers should say at the beginning of the show \"you may or may NOT have the possibility to switch from MC/LC at some point, we will not give you this information in advance and it may not be the same as in seasons 1 and 2\". Because I feel that due to the previous seasons where people could switch, the cast from season 3 did not give much importance to their initial choice. So every time they disclose someone as being a MC or LC, I don't really care. When &gt;!TE!&lt; was revealed, I just thought \"well, &gt;!she!&lt; will simply decide later whether &gt;!she !&lt;changes or not\".\n\n2/ It was a strange move from &gt;!TE!&lt; to seek SY for the secret night. The &gt;!things she said can only encourage SY to be even more interested in SR, in particular the \"I have a lot to think about after the 1-1 date of today\". Girl, how do you not see the risk of her interpreting it as coming it from SR and thinking she has a chance?!&lt;\n\n3/ Regarding the person who will be eliminated next week. If I remember previous seasons correctly, the cast did not choose depending on who they think is a LC, but picked the person they liked the least or had no interest in. With this in mind, would SY and TE be in danger?",

            "comment": "Wow on that preview for next week. Why do you think SR is telling SY to keep following her heart? SR is pretty smart so I bet he figured TE is money catcher. I have two crazy theory.\n\nFirst theory is SR a LC and the best way to get TE to change to love is make her jealous. \n\nTheory two is he's a money catcher trying secure love by giving SY hope and making TE jealous in order to change. \n\nWhat would be crazy is if he changes to MC. Out of everyone SR has the advantage of winning the money. \n\nFor Sy there is a possibility of her being money but I pretty sure she's love. \n\nI will say I don't see TE changing love for SR. Going by the vibe she gives me TE is about her paper. The comment she said she could provide for a guy that is when I knew she was money. \n\nI know we all are guessing SB is money catcher but he is definitely being told by the producers to throw us off. Money catcher for the guys is JH if not SR come in second.",

The camera-people worked hard to capture &gt;!Seung Yeon!&lt; in such a tender, gentle light, with that whole \"smiling through sadness\" feel to the scene.  The piano bar music was perfect for that mood.  That was the best part of the episode.\n\nI hope something good happens for &gt;!Seung Yeon!&lt; in the rest of the show.  However, it feels like &gt;!SR and TE!&lt; are locked at this point.  Maybe the preview for Ep. 6 gives us a little bit of hope for &gt;!SY's!&lt; relevance for the rest of the show?",

Particularly if it's costly to run the heater overnight and so on during winter or snowstorms like these.\n\nMerry Christmas, happy holidays.",

She really bounced back from last ep and it was just great to see her not back down from seizing her chance with Soo Roo. It's a bit sad that no one was sent her a text message but she perserveres. I like her and Soo Roo together way more than Tae Eun.\n\nTae Eun is red flags all over. I sympathise with her choice to play it safe and be a money catcher given her circumstances (older female in Korea) but shes just so insecure, childish, petty, needy and high maintenace. Even if she changes her position I don't see her and Soo Roo lasting at all. \n\nI don't see Soo Ji's appeal outside of her appearance.  Shes all take and no give. It felt oddly weird for her to give Yong Ho the cold shoulder when hes time and time again showed his affections for her.\n\nSeong Beom &amp; Jung Hyun's 1:1 conversations with their interests always feel very surface level and perfunctory. They're always missing that essence of vulnerability that a love catcher would invest. \n\nTae Hyeok defintely a weak catfish entrant. Nothing remarkable or interesting about him so far. Mediocre.",

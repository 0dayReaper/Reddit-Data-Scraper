Supporting my faves Dex and Jinho. I\u2019ve been pleased with the games so far - it brings me back to the days of The Genius... And they still were able incorporate a twist which didn\u2019t feel awkward.",

                    "comment": "&gt;Yurisa \n\nAgree. I think they realised they needed a balance of physical and brainy players in the show. Also, I am glad that they put Dex in the second team so he can show his skills rather than playing brainy games in the main team (if you watched season 1, you know what I mean), hehe. I also like the place of the show, it adds more survival and mystery feel. Looking forward to every Friday now!!",

They assume that she is talking to people one on one to scheme something. The other members could never imagine that Jimin was a spy for an undisclosed second team, but if the other girl was the spy they would have quickly thought it was weird for someone like her to be sneaking around and trying to talk to people. Also, just look at how seemlessly she demanded that he follow her and pack things with him. The dude didn\u2019t even realize he got scammed by her because she is so persuasive. \n\nAlso, maybe it wasn\u2019t intentional but the clothes she stole belonged to the guy she kidnapped, she could have been helping him out by moving it in advance. \n\nI also think he was the perfect person to kidnap because the wilderness team has to kill off someone as soon as they take over the house. We saw this in season1 where the basement team builds a bond and it gets kind of awkward when they have to start eliminating eachother.  So if its got to be someone, it might as well be a guy that isn\u2019t likable, also I think it\u2019d be a mistake the pick the smartest guy, yes you need to win the game to switch houses, but once the wilderness team gets out of the wild, they will have to compete in games against the smart guy. Its better to just pick someone that is decent but not really a contender to win it all.\n\nAlso, I think it was naturally for her to think about taking his money. They are attempting to trick someone into thinking it is a mechanic setup by the producers, it could have made sense to take his money, especially since Jimin has to be able to survive inside the house to keep working as a spy. I also understand why they veto\u2019d that idea because it would be hard to think of an excuse to why he needs to transfer his money. It would be risky, as there is a good chance he might realize that he is getting scammed if they don\u2019t play it off right.",

If they chose the smartest player they would have had to beat him to win the game. They would have essentially been gifting that guy a free pass into the semifinals.

That guy who started cheating and that guy who changed his combination before he left because he anticipated people will cheat, this cast is looking promising from the get go. And of course everyone would mark Pi haha that bitch deserves it and it was so satisfying to see her eliminated. The deathmatch is a welcome mechanic and the first one was an interesting game as well. \n\nE02 \n\nThey swapped the basement for the dungeon, is this the reason why they filmed in Bali? Because renting this entire area is cheaper than making one in Seoul? Either way it's an interesting concept and I hope they come up with a fresh idea if they get S3. Onto the game, when Jimin said she was a fan of jinho I guess she wasn't lying because she was fangirling the whole time you can feel it from the way she interact with him.\n\nSo now we know why we didn't see much of jinho in the trailer is because he was in a different group. But does anyone know if this was filmed before or after time hotel?",

The guys had no reason to worry, because if they lost a guy it would have been even and the girls would have had to accept Pi on their team just to be even. \n\nAlso it only makes sense to protect the weak contestants early on in a show like this because there is practically 0 chance that they win the show. You need easy targets to survive so you can pick them if you need to go into a deathmatch. Eliminate the strong competition early. Also, the guy was volunteering. Why not just let him take the fight and let everyone be happy.\n\nOn one hand I liked how Seungjin called Xitsuh out for not making sense, but I really don\u2019t like how he tried to split the group. Its bad enough that there are less girls on the show than men, you don\u2019t have to instantly eliminate them, they probably aren\u2019t going to win anyway. Being sexist for no reason.\n\nAlso, for anyone familiar with these survival shows, it is super rare for girls to band together to create a majority. This is one of the reasons why they struggle to win, not only are they disrespected by the men, but girls often pick other girls for the deathmatch because they aren\u2019t confident playing against the men so they will typically be selfish and pick a girl that they think they could win against.",

But why does &gt;!Jimin!&lt; of all people got to choose the roles?\n\nEp 2\n\nAh, i see so the hidden council was season 2 basement team.\n \nIt's funny how much Dex fully embraces raw survival while Jinho clearly dislikes it. They're not even in the jungle proper -- these are clearly urban ruins.\n\nFunny how Jinho's streak of somewhat unearned insane luck in games continue even across shows.\n \nDuring Jimin food-stealing i wondered if any of the mansion people tried to look for Parasite team since they must have seen season 1.",

The 4 of them are likable with clear roles/talents, and they have basically become the main characters as the producers probably intended. I'm actually a bit sad seeing how quickly they want to shift things (seeing the preview in ep3/4). Since I want the 4 of them to bond more and survive behind the scenes. \n\nI'm not familiar with Dex but he seems to be a well rounded guy who's pretty sincere. Jinho is very good at what he's good at as expected, but his grumbles about the 'wilderness' are funny too haha. As a homebody I'm happy someone is being relatable.\n\nI've read several comments from Korean watchers and Park Jimin seems to be a mini villain from S1? I have no interest in watching S1, but offering you a perspective from someone who don't know her: she's easy to warm up to, though I'm not sure about her actions as a spy. Can anybody gimme a mini recap of what she basically did in S1?  Hyun Ji is a good supporter and I hope she can show more of herselves future episodes.\n\nBut seriously I hope this team actually becomes a sort of alliance, instead of just being a team for e2 only lol.",

It was basically always about having more people.\n\nS1 was really more about entertainment than the actual game. The games were pretty disappointing.

As a watcher I have no interest in judging her by how she used to play but this judgement is necessary for the players, and you really helped me understand their movements.  \n\nThis is just a random thought based off your comments, personally I'm still okay w players like Park Jimin. Definitely not my type of play style (im a sucker for classical brainplay), but it's better that she actually does something (political play,be it betrayal or anything) rather than nothing.\n\nAnd very offtopic but I wanna rant:\n\nI'm also watching Time Hotel now and I personally really don't like Chloe. I THINK (my opinion only) she doesn't do much and survived just because. Her 'politic' is also nonexistent, despite that she had lots of comments to give like she actually did something and others owe her. It's even more annoying that you can tell she's not actually stupid. So players like Park Jimin who actually does something for themselves are at least better. \n\nWith that being said, just based on the first 2 episodes this seems better than Time Hotel. Tbh Time Hotel is quite disappointing overall, I feel like the casting overall is a miss. I know some watchers say Jinho's play is not as good in Time Hotel (I can see where they're coming from) BUT as a Jinho's fan trying(/failing?) to objectively watch it I think the casting doesn't allow for any 'good play' and he's doing very good despite the weird circumstance. I remember Jinho being frustrated towards Hyun Gyu trying to strike a deal without a chip (\"what will I get from you?\"), and recently at Eun Kyu for playing 'with nothing to lose'. As I shared his sentiments in frustrations towards the casts, those little comments from Jinho kept me sane lol. \n\nI sincerely hope Bloody Game 2  players have more tact.",

If you watch the trailers you can see them in an outfit they werent wearing on day 1 when they got kicked. It's looking like we have 3 factions this season given that they arent in the jungle and they arent in the house proper right now.",

Last season, they only use panelists faces for teasers, now they starts using the players (Dex kinda get it big in these last 2 years, Jinho is a survival brainy show legend so hes a no-brainer, and Jimin which is basically the 'identity' of the show).",

I liked the commentary in season 1 but there is just so much content to squeeze into each episode since there are two separate teams. Like how they basically split the first day into two episodes. \n\nThey also kinda failed to be like the Genius in season1. There weren\u2019t many insane plays made in season1 near the end and most of the gameplay was just betrayal and drama. The fun part about season 1 was seeing how the underground team lived.",

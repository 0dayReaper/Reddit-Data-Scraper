Buldak Ramen is not spicy enough for a Mexican is just so funny to me, I can't even take the Buldak Carbonara.",

This episode highlights each customers imo.\n\nFirstly, I wonder if there's word going around about the ramyeon? Everyone is ordering that! \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\n\nI adore the couple who had spicy chicken and bulgogi rice? They were so smitten of each other and seemed like one of those bestfriend that became lovers trope! They match each other energy so well. It is endearing, haha. Kind of remind me of a couple from Youn's Stay too, the one that goes to the same university and literally spends 24/7 with each other? \n\nThe lady who was on her own seemed like she had a peaceful time there. It is nice to see her enjoying her own me time. \n\nAlso, the food critic guy!! It is admirable how he can guess the ingredients used? Coz I could never, lol. For me personally, if it tastes good, the ingredient is love, and that's that. \n\nThe part where Taehyung opened the cash register made me lol. That was quite random. Also, it amuses me when he gets excited over his own cooking, haha. \n\nThe dalgona challenge! It was fun to watch the german group being excited over it. Wooshik bang hand motion was cute. \n\nYumi predictions are always spot on. She really reminds me of my mum whenever that happens. It's like \"told you so\" moment.",

The cute couple and their interactions were like spring awakening to me. I am rooting for them. Okay, I'll fangirl later.",

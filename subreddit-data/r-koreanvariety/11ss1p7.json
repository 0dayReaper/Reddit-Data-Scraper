Only watching Divorce Attorney Shin since it's very hard to find good ones.\n\nAs for variety, I'm more into sports variety show (Let's Play Soccer 2, Shooting Stars and A Clean Sweep but the latter is currently on break and will come back this April as far as I know).\n\n2D1N, Running Man (but only when episodes are interesting) and Europe Outside the Tent as well. But it's different when variety shows interact with locals like food variety shows that's why I enjoy them which currently I only watch Jinny's Kitchen for that so I'm really excited for the new Baek show.",

They'll be having 2 matches with pro teams which I guess would be the opening games for the new season.",

Their interactions with the locals, particularly the elders and kids, was what made it wholesome for me to watch. Still, this is interesting and I'll look forward for it! \n\nSide: i see so many variety shows going overseas these days",

I didn\u2019t even finish the second season. It focused too much on logistics and less on the relationships with the locals. I hope they at least have a small town vibe like the first season.",

Also they aren\u2019t household names outside of Korea so shoppers/civilians are probably going to be less receptive overseas when they are slow, learning the ropes, or don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing at first. \n\nObviously I\u2019m just speculating. Maybe they find someway to make it work. Season 1 was just amazing because of the interactions and how we got to get familiar with so many locals, elders, and their stories. Would be sad to lose the moments even more than in the second season.",

If they do the S3 in SK rn there is quite big risk that as soon as there is any social media sighting reports, some peeps will flock to the area n the store n disrupt the intended seminatural settings of the show.  \n\nEven if they shoot S3 in the US most likely they will shoot it in a Korean-owned store, so it has regular customers who are familiar with the owners aldy including myb Korean immigrants that have long lived in the US. They prob also will hire 1 or 2 celeb parttimer who can speak English fluently to help throughout S3.",

    "postText": "Just finished Singles\u2019 Inferno 2, Love Catcher in Bali, and Transit Love 2. All these seasons had couples with killer chemistry. \n\nSI 2 had Jinyoung x Seulki, all their moments together had this tension and their chemistry felt palpable (the pool scene, i melted \ud83e\udee0). \n\nLC had Sooro x Taeeun, the way they would just look at other adoringly without needing to say anything. Will rewatch just for them!!\n\nTL2 had Haeeun x Hyungyu. The way he approached her and cared for her made me swoon!\n\nWhat are some other couples do you think had this same sort of magnetic chemistry?",

They both felt like two mature people that also have a playful side and there were so many scenes that I thought they were going to risk it all and go for a kiss lol. Still mad that Netflix didn't show their pool date in full.\n\nAnd it's quite obvious how smitten they are with each other especially Sejun cause I always noticed how red his ears were when he was with Soe lol. Soe also seems to act more cutely with him. Jinyoung and Seulki had chemistry but I feel like it's more of a physical one.",

            "comment": "I thought this was like the final addition group.  But then I saw the preview...are they going to do a whole new round of 4 sports like they just did?  They added 5 new players, which I thought could really help the team. Basically, 4 instant starters and one possible starter. Use some of the current guys as bench players, but if they are planning on adding another 5 or so, it is starting to get to be a bit much unless they start kicking people off the team. Also, I would like some real soccer matches more often than once every 5-6 weeks. I'm a bit burned out with the current format of letting the new sport show off their talents and then playing a short Futsal match. I'm kind of ready for real, full matches for a bit. I wonder if it has to do with it still being cold and not a lot of amateur teams being active during the winter and early spring months.  This might be a way of filling time until more teams are available for matches. \n\nTo answer your question, I think some of the veteran players showed they could step up, but a few continued to be sore spots. When the level of competition and skill rises, you can see who has fine ball control skills and who is just athletic. Honestly,  that has kind of been their bugaboo. I think the new additions will really sure up the roster with players who can handle the ball, keep the ball, and make good passes even under duress and stress. I will be interested to see how this all pans out, I just would like a real soccer match every now and then to break up the monotony.",

I mean if we look back at it, they usually start their off-season training in winter. For example, Namhae Island, Qatar and lastly Geoje Island. If I'm not mistaken, they lost 2 matches in Geoje Island and after that they started the 3rd Visiting Audition. \n\nI mean they should at least feed us with In-House Soccer Match tho like when they invite pro soccer players or do a practice match between them while learning new skills. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeels like they are losing the show's rhythm bit by bit.",

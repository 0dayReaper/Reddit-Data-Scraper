My hunch (one of them, at least) is because of the insertion of the customers' conversations.\n\nIn the broadcast version, they will obviously put Korean subtitles below (for domestic viewers) every time they comment on the restaurant/dish/people, since customers use a multitude of foreign languages. In the streaming version, though, they didn't feel the need to do that, since the closed captions can translate the same comments that the customers are saying.\n\nIt's just a bummer that with that consideration granted, a lot of what makes k-variety really interesting was taken out. Like extra subtitles to emphasize moments (ep 3 spoiler incoming) &gt;!(like here when Seojin said there were more orders so the interns got out of their daydream, the \uc8fc\ubb38 \ud558\ub098 \ub354 is omitted on the Prime version)!&lt;",

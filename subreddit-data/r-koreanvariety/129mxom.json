The way she threw the pillow twice in the background when Patricia couldn't guess the song correctly... lmfao. And when she switched the consonants, it was absolutely meme worthy. The retired dancer Leejung text... lol... morning Hyeri sitting on the floor as she stares out the window then the screen cuts to Morning Patricia... whoever is handling the sub texts on the show needs a raise. Miyeon's got a lovely voice. Love Dive really suits her. I know Chaewon's going to redeem herself eventually. I have a feeling there'll be a game that will work in her favor!&lt;\n\nIt's never not funny when the girls all come together and move closer to the PD's area in order to convince them that their answers are correct.",

Usually female idols are trying to show off as much of their legs as they can get away with but then immediately have to awkwardly cover up with blankets or pillows. This gives them so much more freedom of movement without concern. Also, I'm a bit incredulous that across the seat of Chaewon's pants is written, 'I hope your day is as nice as my butt'; I didn't realize she could be that daring and funny.\n\n&gt;!The keywords didn't help much but picking someone that would probably guess the song was helpful. They still had to give them a lot more time, and there were a couple editing moments (like Yena with Pop) where the rest of the cast were suddenly in different locations which made me think there were more hints or failure/redo moments they cut and spliced into the show to allow them to earn something or they might have gone another show without money. The same with Yena spitting out 5 different words hoping at least one of them was right. I'm not complaining if this is what they have to do after learning they need to recalibrate the game difficulty level.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Yena in that wide squat pose with the hood up and crossed arms was a brilliant visual gag. It's nice that the show is getting better and funnier each week.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The new box game next week reminds me of the one on How Do You Play when Mijoo and Haha joined as regulars. That was a spelling game where this seems like math; there are going to be a lot of crushed boxes.!&lt;",

I initially thought they wouldn't give much of the other members songs to the others as well but after the IDLE, Girl's Day and Yena's song my WIZ* ONE heart hoped that the next question after it was from a project group and even Leejung said IZ*ONE in a passing comment would be a song from them lmao, it was just the Celeb Five song that Chaeyeon danced to in Eating Trip which was p funny but still I wished it was.\n\nAlso you could clearly see that Yena probably dances to a lot of her former members choreos with how fast she danced to Fearless and Love Dive LMAO. Another case of Yena bringing out the Ssamachi in Chaewon as well, she might bring it out every ep atp. It's probably a dead horse atp but with that challenge where they change the tone that if Yuri were there she would've killed that I would've loved to see her flex her vocals like with that game.\n\nOverall though this was a fun ep, much better because it wasn't just full of fails honestly, seemed a bit more lenient this time which made the ep more fun to watch as it wasn't just \"here's them succeeding in the start/end\" and the rest is just full of fails, the Miyeon bday celebration was cute as well. This cast's chemistry is honestly fun to watch.\n\nI think the games could use a bit more variety though, it's been too much of these vowel games and even the group ones where they go to that house it's a bit same-y with the guessing thing only thing different is instead of guessing dances/songs it's just covers now but maybe the games will change since they don't have to deal with the snow anymore.\n\nNext ep though it's finally the end of them freezing their butts off and also end of Miyeon's blonde hair since she dyed it around her bday I'll miss her blonde era but she's killing it with her black hair looks esp in recent IDLE performances.",

Mostly because the games repeat too much, what creates interesting dynamics the first or second time becomes a little boring after that, especially when it seems that they cruise through it. Funny how most people think the games are too hard generally, i think that makes the show fun, as miyeon put it \"go big or go home\".  \nStill funny parts in this one too ofc, but i hope there will be more variety in games, new dynamics, new fails, higher stakes, that is what is needed.",

But the \"Web DL\" doesn't. Subs start instantly when the video has the TV rating splash screen and \"previously on\" playing before the episode starts (so basically at 1:52 is when the subs should begin). \n\nVLC has sub synchronization but unfortunately I can't get it to work when I add that much time to the delay. After like 10+ seconds of delay it either doesn't ever show up or it gets janky. \n\nSo I basically have to wait until the subscene gets the TV Web DL subtitle version put up on it.",

So I end up fixing it at the end of that game when I recognize some of the korean words. But I'm not that good as before with that software anymore. But at least I could enjoy the episode. Thanks to all of you.\n\nP.s:Thanks ScrewySiu! Until next week,",

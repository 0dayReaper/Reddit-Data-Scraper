    "postText": "My take on Running Man lately is that it\u2019s boring now. I\u2019ve been a avid fan since the beginning of the show it was the second korean variety I started watching and I never missed an episode Sundays has been my favorite day from the ages 12-24. After Kwangsoo ended up leaving the shows games and even the banter started going downhill a little bit for me but I still enjoyed the show because I\u2019m a loyal fan of the show and it\u2019s members separately.\n\nNow the main reason I probably don\u2019t enjoy the show that much is how much the show relies on Yoo Jaesuk, Jee Sukjin, and Kim Jongkook. Their banter and teasing is not enjoyable anymore to me and they take up too much screentime their strong personalities overshadow the rest of the members even though Haha, Somin, and Sechan try to change the subject, be included, or make jokes it\u2019s just overshadowed by the first 3. Jihyo kinda lost her character and hasn\u2019t found a new one to stick first it was being beautiful/lucky/good at games, then Monday couple, then once Gary left it was her being lucky and good at games still, then her banter with the other members, her love line with jongkook, now she\u2019s seems very quiet and only jumps in conversation sometimes. Maybe it\u2019s just the editing but the show is losing its charm to me. Obviously it\u2019s not just the loss of Kwangsoo for me because it\u2019s only been the last 20-30 episodes I started feeling this way.\n\nI enjoyed the members in their other shows more lately then when they\u2019re all together on running man.\n\nWhat do y\u2019all think it is did I grow out of the show or should I give it time?\n\nEdit: stopped replying to most comments because y\u2019all assumed when I said the games and the interaction got boring I meant I want them to do name tag removal\u2026.. I don\u2019t care about the name tag game. I know the members are all past the ages for active games and some of them have problems with their bodies like their knees so I still find most of the games they play now enjoyable. It\u2019s the conversations and teasing I find repetitive and not funny someone pointed out that the members are probably helping JSJ be the focus in the conversation and teasing because they want him to win the Grand Prize. That sounds plausible because it\u2019s only been recently I felt the conversations have been repetitive I\u2019ll probably just pop in on the show every once in awhile because the recent episode was actually really fun.",

I hate the episodes where they are always indoors and play some game or themes with endless rules which is so boring. The cast also just feels a bit jaded and lack hunger which is understandable since they have been doing it for 10+ yrs and the cast hardly every changed. Jihyo has been on the low for at least the last 3 years but is still on the show doing nothing.",

            "comment": "The entertainment value has dropped significantly. I mostly continue watching because I still like the cast.  \n  \nRepetitive banter, new stories are rare, interactions are stale, as are a lot of the character tropes.  \nKwang Soo always being the betrayer was like that, but he \"sold\" it and kept it entertaining for way longer than possible simply by how creative he was in finding ways to cheat or make it humorous, whether he was winning or losing. Like some of his schemes and attempts were just so ridiculous you had to be impressed when he succeeded and it was hilarious when he got caught.  \n  \nHaha and Se Chan, Suk Jin and YJS, always being selfish and miserly is too much and too frequent without adding entertainment value.    \nOne character like that, fine. Four is too much.  \n  \nThey also suffer from the quality and frequency of guest appearances. New dynamics and stories from guest interactions help inject some fresh banter and it's always entertaining seeing guests that are either out of their element but getting dragged into it, or surprisingly good in variety as opposed to how you may normally see them.  \n  \nThe themes and games suffer from much of the same. Either being unimaginative, impractical, or repetitive.  \nName tag races that are physical, it's understandable that we don't see them often. You can still have races that aren't overly physical however. Alternate methods of eliminations have been used before and you don't have to be running around all the time if it's just a series of checkpoints for a race.  \nThe competitions and missions give the cast something to work with rather than trying to make entertainment out of things like driving around or cooking a meal.  \n  \nThey've thrown a lot of things at the wall over the years, and some of them have stuck, but I'd rather see them try something new that doesn't work than defaulting to member-only MT type shows. Like when all they do is eat at different locations for an entire episode where the whole \"game\" is simply deciding who will pay/get the penalty.",

Also would be great if they can invite 3 regular guests (2 ladies 1 guy) to make the team even. Leaders will change every week so everyone will get a chance to be leader and draft for their own team(leaders will get bonus points if their team wins for that week). They should also be let known before drafting what this week's games requires e.g. luck, intelligence, reaction, general knowledge, memory, balance, strength, sense of direction, teamwork, humour, cooking skills, acting skills, logical deduction, social deduction (teams are drafted beforehand but the members don't know whose team they are in and the leaders have to convince them while playing an amazing race)\n\nThis creates more competitiveness and more involvement in all members but without the need to have high physical activities. There's also progression (maybe show us the ranking at the start and end of every ep) involved.\n\nPoints will then maybe be converted to roulette slots or lottery balls for a chance to win the better reward. \n\nSuggestion for reward/penalty could maybe be like going on an overseas trip together but one would be the helper and the other is just there to enjoy. And then of course include games where the helpers can do secret missions to have a chance to revolt.",

Personally that\u2019s what bugged me most about the \u201cdriving around Seoul\u201d episode\u2014not so much the other members \u201cbullying\u201d JSJ as it was JSJ mouthing off about what everyone else should be doing, and YJS just doing whatever he wants.  \n\nI mean, yes, YJS is a legend, he works his magic to help others, particularly the guests, shine.  But \u201csecretly adding ramyun seasoning to make the food being cooked taste better\u201d was funny in 2009.  In 2023, doing it just because \u201cit\u2019s a gag I always do\u201d is the opposite of funny.\n\nWhen he\u2019s not taking the elders\u2019 side, KJK just keeps to himself and keeps busy (hence contently being the \u201cfire guy\u201d).  Ji Hyo\u2019s just Ji Hyo and doesn\u2019t get involved.  So Min and Se Chan aren\u2019t perfect, they do make mistakes, but when they are confident in doing something, they\u2019re more confidently right than confidently wrong (which is more a YJS and JSJ thing).  Poor Haha is the guy stuck in the middle trying to moderate between the youngsters and the old fogeys and keep things light.\n\nSo yeah, I get that the cast chemistry is important and irreplaceable; it\u2019s just that more so recently than ever, the old people are showing their age\u2014not just physically, as expected (and as taking place over the past thirteen years), but mentally as well.\n\nOne thing that Running Man has shown over the years is its resilience\u2014if a format or premise is getting tired, they can adjust and come back at least as good as before.  So if one feels like they\u2019re outgrowing the show, give it time; sure, stop watching if you feel like you want to, but don\u2019t forget to check in once in a while\u2014the show may have overcome the issues you left over.  And when it comes to the physical stuff that they don\u2019t do much of anymore, the Philippine version (where no-one is over 35 and many hover around 24) has entertained me a lot; I just wish it was subbed in English.",

The production team gives them very little material and expects them to create jokes and content out of thin air. The funniest parts of the previous episode were created by YJS and the other members making up their own games because it was obvious that what the production team had designed was boring. The episode before that consisted of Hyung In giving them ONE roulette and a bunch of coins and basically telling them to figure it out themselves.\n\nThe driving episode was another example of the production team giving them nothing to build on. Driving from one place to another is not a good concept. That is why you got YJS acting stubborn and deliberately getting lost, that is why you got everyone teasing JSJ, that is why you got KJK taking one side to create conflict and build tension. Even the maknaes acting irritated is them playing a character. Viewers who don't understand that might feel a bit put off, but the members know what they're doing. I don't think we'll get any change until the production team starts creating more solid concepts that rely less on the cast carrying entire episodes.",

People might want games or action related theme, but since I don't really care that much especially since they have great chemistry and can bring that up to make something entertaining is a great new chapter for RM and I love their \"talk\" time tbh. \n\nI do wonder it's just RM PD staff doesn't really have something new to offer and they being stubborn to push the \"chemistry\" and \"talk\" OR it's just after research from a lot of indicator and feedback from viewers, they decided that viewer as in Korea GP want more these talk time. \n\nOnce stand in apex of Korea variety show, going down from the throne after the production staff decided to end the show and said that it's hard to keep offering new ideas every week as one of the reason. The fact that at least RM have push \"chemistry\" as new strong point for the change is one way to keep going on in the battlefield. Atleast they transition to half talk show half game. Non talk show to keep going more than decade is hard since they need to give something \"new\" every week or two, while talk show just need a great host that can keep the conversation interesting and throwing a bits jokes and a new guest every week in hope they bring interesting story.\n\nAfter quick glance their rating, I do hope they can overcome the problem and atleast getting the rating back to on average 6-8% first. Every year, the rating average is keep going low. While on 2018 they averaging in 6 to 8%, last year and this year they get around 4-5%. As long they can get it back to atleast stable 5-6% this year, we can at least expecting Running Man can still running more for good fee years. But if next year they really touch average 2-3%, we really need to prepare mentally for losing our Monday weekly show (since the subbed one comes on Monday)",

It feels like it's rare she gives input on things and is mostly just there filling in space. The Sechan and Somin \"love line\" became way overplayed to me to the point where it got boring and I just wished they'd move on. Yoo Jae Suk constantly insulting Suk Jin or cutting him down or interrupting when he'd say things got old too, before he focused on Suk Jin it was constantly with Kwang Soo.  \n\n\nSome of it can be funny at times, but when it's every episode it becomes boring too, and it's really like he tries way too hard every week to be the center of attention when he's already practically the host as is. Like give others a moment to speak for the love of god.  \n\n\nKJK has funny moments and I feel he never really overdoes anything or tries to run with a joke for too long, which is something I feel Se Chan does way too often because it's all he really has to work off of until the next funny thing pops up for him to ride the coat tails of.  \n\n\nHaHa I feel has given up, he has his funny moments, but otherwise it doesn't even feel like he's trying anymore. He doesn't seem to put much effort into games or even seems like he's just being intentionally bad at them for the sake of some screen time, even if not funny. I know they're all capable, but it feels like theyve all become complacent at this point.  \n\n\nNot to mention the PD team seeming to go with the safe route when it comes to games or locations. This past ep with going to SeChans hometown was funny, but it feels like its rare for the crew to be out in public like they were recently. Just give me a trip where they end up in Japan, China, Australia, wherever again please.",

At this point, all the members have accomplished what they needed to on the show. What made the family projects and the anniversary project so fun was because it was something out of the norm and gave you something to look forward to. The episodes that includes the staffs also makes for good content. Having games every week where they earn R coins for a chance to win a beef or ginseng set does not help that at all and gets really monotonous for me.\n\nMy other complaint is SJH. Sometimes I forget she's even on the show and hardly ever notice her but when I do, she never does anything. When a member with a decade experience feels like the actual guest, something is wrong. I feel bad for the guests who come on with so much potential while somebody else does the bare minimum and then on to the next shoot.\n\nWith that out of the way, I hope the PD can find a way to make the episodes more meaningful and memorable while there's still time left.

They prepare a lot of concepts incase they encounter problem while the recent PDs rely on what game would the member likes. And the strawberry game will always appear because it's funny how JS and SJ will always be the victim of this game. The show transition to mission base theme to comedic acts. JS and SJ has always been a lame player along with KS and they still did. KS and JS do it for comedic purpose. JK still a a strong hot-headed player who doesn't listen well to others but a strong team-player when needed. HH is a random scene stealer, he is a scene stealer when he wants to and if the concepts allows him to but if not he stays in the background even until today. JH succeeded in the beginning because her goal on the show is to complete the mission, i think its also the reason why she wins a lot during the early days of RM. While the show transition she did not, her bickering to the guys lessen as she mature which is not on her favor. Her monday couple is strong character but they actually did not play it all the time, its just a role that they use when its suitable. SM was been added to lame player who focus on comedic acts and she really did it well while SC is applying all of the character from other members which also somehow works on him. \n\nI even think theres a little problem with the editing and camera side, i think they lack of good camera angles which affect their editing team. The cast carries own camera, which can cause not a good angle whuch cause them not to include. I think everyone of them layback a little to more. The PDs and writers stop creating good concepts to cameras just stay still and allows member to capture themselves to some cast. \n\nSBS use the show to access more profit, how they provide online fan meeting as online fan meeting really generates money specially from internationals.",

I watch it now because I have nothing to watch when I\u2019m free. \n\nI thought the new PD was not bad though of course there will always be hits and misses. For example, I didn\u2019t really enjoy the Cha Taehyun episode but others did. \n\nMembers wise, props to Somin and Haha. They\u2019re really good at reading and lifting the mood. Chemistry wise, it\u2019s like watching a family talk/banter, if that makes sense. It\u2019s just so familiar. They always have a lot to say so I really enjoy their banter. I agree with your point on YJS JSJ KJK banter though. Sometimes it is a lot. But what can I do? Admittedly, it does sometimes make the occasionally dull episode more interesting. \n\nAs for Jihyo, as everyone can already tell, she kind of disappears into the shadow. Sometimes she tries but comes off as very random (Eg: Wanting to be the master out of nowhere and for no reason during the Cha Taehyun episode). She used to be my favourite but now it\u2019s Somin. \n\nAt the end of the day, I do think that the members and crew recognise the show\u2019s longevity but also that it\u2019s slowing down (both content and members). Nevertheless, it\u2019s still popular internationally and domestically. \n\nMaybe they need something new soon to rejuvenate the show or that it will adapt to a new format like a talk show as they suggested in an earlier episode. No one knows yet but I\u2019ll still keep watching RM out of habit.",

I find running man china is a lot better with this as you'll find the relationships super wholesome so when they do start bickering and teasing it makes it even more funny as its not as constant as rm Korea. Also another major thing is the fact the cast has stayed the same for so long apart from the 2 departures of Gary and LKS and 2 ARRIVALS of somin and sechan so it gets stale quite quick sickle they're so used to each other. I think the cast needs a revamp, not all the members need to go but I think it needs more variety which you can see form rm china. They change their members quite a lot compared and despite it being heart breaking seeing some of the beloved members leave, it still keeps that freshness about.",

Though the past few weeks they actually had interesting people on.  But like they used to have popular guests almost every week and now they can go months without any guest. I think the guests allow the group to have someone to bounce their personalities off in a different manner than they would each other.\n\nThat said, I love that they tease each other and kind of make fun of the critiques by KJK recently being overly agreeable because people complained he was too antagonistic prior.  It feels like the way me and my friends tease each other and give each other a hard time.  They all know each other super well, so their humor is going to be more nuanced when it is between group members.  And thus why I said they need popular guests to come on the show.  It let's them change how they apply their humor.\n\nBut I still enjoy the show.  It shifted a bit, but it still feels like running man to me.  There are hits and misses for sure, but the core of the show is still there.  They evolved from loads of physical games and  location travel to a more conversational and like party games style.  I am sure part of that is the age of the members.  As a 41 year old myself, I know the body doesn't recover at the same speed it used to and Seok Jin is almost 60.  Running in a train station or large mall for 14 straight hours from 10pm until like noon the next day just isn't in the cards anymore.",

Its a fact\n\nI slowly stopped finding interest in my previous lifestyle and lost interest to watch the next season of Hello Baby or fanboy over idol girls.\n\nEveryones different and each to their own but for to you \"Ugh..\" me. proves to me of your mindset.\n\nEnd of the day I took my career path seriously to work my way up, got married, had children and raised them and my main focus was supporting and feeding my family.\nAint got time for my old lifestyle, so yeah... my personal reason of losing interest was about \"Growing up\"\n\nTbis doesnt mean you cant enjoy Kdramas and shows as an adult, ofcourse you can! I wish I did but I moved onto other tbings that bring pleasure in life.\n\nIt also shows how much RM meant to me for it to be the only show from my.past I still watch",

Even JSJ is running about on the Outrun Spinoff on occasion. \n\nHe said they're running less because they were having trouble coming up with different variations on the nametag race that hadn't been done and ratings in Korea were falling when they did too many physical games without variations in them.",

Running Man is a show I grew up with and as someone who started watching in 2011-2012, it was hands down the funniest and creative program I had ever watched. It was an era, a  different period and as a viewer I've had to accept that RM 2023 and RM 2012 will always be different. Not because the games are less fun but the members had fresh eyes and were willing to make \"a fool\" of themselves and go the extra mile for this new show. They were also younger. That innocence is not there anymore but RM's catalogue is so impressive, it's just unbelievable how the members have been able to renew themselves  over the years and the different themes and concepts that have come on over the years.  It's a classic program and one that will remain in the books.",

But maybe they were not paid enough.",

Always looked forward to each episode but lately I've found myself skipping through scenes or even skipping entire episodes. Makes me sad. The producers are really letting this show go down. If you're going to recycle concepts/ideas, at least recycle good ones, I mean why am I all of a sudden watching these guys cook and eat every week? You're just hoping to catch these guys throw out some one liners so you can have a good edit. Lazy stuff man. Even from the very beginning of the show, the producers recycled the spy episodes almost every week, but at least they made it interesting. Leaving cameras on during their \"rest\" period shows that you're just hoping they catch some interesting conversations instead of utilizing everyone's talents &amp; strengths. The show is seriously missing Lee Kwang-soo. He used to engage with everyone especially Song Ji-hyo, with YJS only engaging with Jeon So-min, Song Ji-hyo looks completely left out. At this point, the producers are hanging on off the shows good name and the casts reputation, nothing more.",

And he got way boring just waiting on jaesuk to slap him.  Plus Somin actually has carriers the show a lot. Se Chen and haha also does a good job and Jihyo lost her touch a little but she\u2019s bouncing back. The show is better now. I watch it every Sunday and my favorites are Somin and Jaesuk.",

It\u2019s obvious the current members are aged and can\u2019t do extraneous exercises as they used, even the mental games. Like they all know each pretty well and can tell who\u2019s acting and whatnot.",

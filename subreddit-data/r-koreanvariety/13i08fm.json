Will Paik Jong Won be able to reach world-class fame with his food business? The story of the Business Genius\u2019 new store opening begins now.\n\nCast:\n\n* Baek Jong Won\n* Lee Jang Woo\n* John Park\n* Yuri\n* BamBam\n\n|Info/Torrent|\n|:-|\n|[1080p-F1RST](https://torrentsee164.com/topic/298326)|\n|[720p-WANNA](https://torrentsee163.com/topic/298325)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Streaming|Subs|\n|:-|:-|\n|[VIU](https://www.viu.com/ott/ph/en/vod/2138024/The-Genius-Paik)|[EN 720p-WANNA](https://www.mediafire.com/file/9czjofvd7vk0b0c/%25EC%259E%25A5%25EC%2582%25AC%25EC%25B2%259C%25EC%259E%25AC_%25EB%25B0%25B1%25EC%2582%25AC%25EC%259E%25A5.E07.230514.720p.WANNA.srt/file)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

His effort to learn the language, his intelligence to be able to converse already, and his soft skills with the butcher and also smarts to manage the food hall and adapt quickly and straightforward with his ideas.  I think Chef Baek, mini-Baek and Yuri were able to focus in the kitchen coz John Park has a good management of the dining hall.",

Many, many restaurant owners and managers would have taken months (or even close) before they came to that realization. It might be a small thing, but for John to notice and say something, he really really impressed me.",

I also noticed that the Chef/Owner of Restaurant T seemed friendly to him.  By the way, I also like Italian-Japanese chef/customer.  He really is a chef with him tasting each component, and kudos to him for giving up their seats early even with their coffee orders.",

            "comment": "1) I really liked this episode. Shows the truth about just how hard this business is. They were so smashed at the end of service.\n\n2) What I really like about this series is that it shows not just 'improve your menu' which Alley Restaurants did, but also shows a different side to Baek- the marketing genius side- that was never seen before. \n\n3) Strange that literally none of the customers notice how gorgeous Yuri is. It's not normal to have a staff member looking like that!\n\n4) I know (from Alley Restaurants) that Baek likes to go cheap and popular and value, but it just doesn't seem like he has enough tables here or that turnover is fast enough (especially with how everyone seems to take an hour at lunch), so I'm really looking forward to the next episode to see how they solve this.\n\n5) I was wondering how they got the sales figures from the other restaurants, but now I get it. Watching that Japanese chef calculate Baek's sales, they probably did the same thing for every other restaurant (price per head \\* number of people).\n\n6) Finally Kim made it here. I'm surprised he wasn't there from the start, actually- but I guess they wanted to show that they could make it even without him. Or maybe schedules didn't work and he was travelling for matches?",

So the best option is using the fresh pasta noodles and they even highlighted it. \n\nalso baek jongwon is already using different ingredients so most of the dishes are a different version of itself. remember that the grocery store that they went to doesn't have much korean products so they have to experiment a lot.",

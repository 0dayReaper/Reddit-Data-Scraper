A lot of the fun was him talking to chat and watching him struggle before solving problems.\n\nThey trimmed the episodes down from 2 hours to 30 minutes so he just moves from problem to problem with ease. There's no tension or buildup. It's kind of like doing an escape room when you already know all the answers.\n\nThere's still half of them I haven't seen so maybe it'll be different when it's all new to me and I don't vaguely remember what happened.",

Since each ep is \\~30min you can easily consume one while eating or doing some chores. The funniest moments are the interactions b/w YJS, the staff, and the chat and when he and the chat are both in disbelief at how ridiculous some of the situations turn out to be.\n\nFirst 2 eps were okay, but eps 3 and 4 were by far the most fun so if you're just checking out an ep before committing, I suggest 3/4. Without spoiling too much, the supporting char in 3 and the very last part of 4 had me crackling like a madman.\n\nedit: For some reason I thought this was pretty recent but it turns out this was filmed around May of last year. Turns out S2 will likely launch first half of this year so that might be something to look forward to.",

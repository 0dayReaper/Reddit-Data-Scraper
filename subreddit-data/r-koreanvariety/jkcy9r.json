Just seeing how the translator translates Korean (the word for justice in the recent ep yesterday) that sometimes Jessi has trouble mispronouncing, to an easily understandable translation + spelling that English speakers can understand right away (jastice? justiche?) to mean how you'd mispronounce sth in English. This is way more seamless than the usual variety show translations, where you'd need to repeat a scene several times to get the joke, which can be a play on Korean words that none of us would know the context to. \n\nthat said I think it's necessary for Showterview, given how its audience seems to be foreigners/overseas Koreans",

But seriously, Showterview and everything is so good, like Workman, Wassup Man and so on, even random channels will have really well done subs, it's ridiculous. They do a great job of translating the necessary Korean captions, getting us through word puns that don't make sense in English, giving off their own flair too.\n\nAnd it goes hand in hand with the editing which is amazing too. It seems like those Jessi interviews are always scheduled for an hour and then they go way past that every time. It's just hilarious, by the end they've made a total mockery of the Korean interview format. The fact that they can edit it down to a cohesive 10-20 minute segment is amazing.\n\nWe're just spoiled these days. An idol group would upload a VLOG and within seconds there will be comments asking for ENG SUB??? I'm grateful for the shows we have.",

SF Miss: **DH Kim DaYeong** controls a loose ball and passes to **DH JeongSun** who then passes to a wide open **DH DaYoung** who traps the ball and is marked by **SF JeolMi**, but manages to take a shot on target that is at **SF YiSooNal**'s legs which she stops, the ball is loose but not out of bounds, **DH DaYoung** misplays a ball by kicking it deep into her own defensive zone where **SF YeWon** was camping, **SF YeWon** has all the time in the world with no defenders around and only **DH ChaeYoung** in front of the net, she takes a low rolling shot that barely misses wide left by a foot and the ball goes out of bounds!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' SF GOAL: **DH DaYoung** takes a sideline kick-in with a pass to **DH JeongSun** who shoots on net but **SF IlJooEoTeo** blocks and **SF EuDDeum** kicks forward, out running all the DH defenders, she has a two-and-zero with **SF KKangMi** running pace with her on her right side, **SF EuDDeum** dribbles all the way to the 16yard box and takes a shot on target that low mid-left side that **DH ChaeYoung** manages to get a hand on but not enough!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' DH Goal: **SF YiSooNal** throws a slow moving rolling pass to **SF IllJooEoTeo** which is intercepted by **DH Amy** who takes a one-time shot on target that goes in, pressue play resulted in this goal, an alert **DH Amy** takes advantage of a bad pass!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' SF Miss: **SF EuDDeum** kicks a shot on net from a loose ball that goes wide left short side by a foot, **DH ChaeYoung** was in position and tracking the ball well!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' DH Miss: **DH Amy** takes a corner kick-in and passes to **DH Kim DaYeong** who takes a power shot on target that is blocked by **SF EuDDeum**'s upper body, the ball bounces back to **DH Kim DaYeong** who takes another shot but it goes wide to the left side, the hard shot on **SF EuDDeum** doesn't seem to faze her!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' DH Miss: **DH JeeIn** crosses a beauty pass to a cutting **DH Kim DaYeong** on the opposite wing who follows up with a one-time shot on net which goes to the short left side, a glorious chance missed, these girls need to start trapping balls and taking better shots that aren't rushed.!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' SF Goal: **SF KKangMi** dekes out **DH Amy** on the right wing side at the centerline and continues her dribbling towards the DH net, she moves towards the middle where **DH JeongSun** is defending and **DH JeongSun** kicks the ball out that hits **SF YeWon** and the ball bounces towards the DH net that **SF KKangMi** one-time shoots on target to the bottom right corner that beats **DH ChaeYoung**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' DH Goalie Change: **DH ChaeYoung** is subbed off, **DH Amy** puts on the goalie gloves, and **DH JeeIn** enters the game, looks like coach **SooGeun** wants all offense as time is running out!&lt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFINAL SCORE LINE:  &gt;!---------------- DarkHorse 1 - **2 StreamingFighter** ------super sloppy game, with some spurts of coherent playmaking, looks like SF need to seriously work on their fitness before they try to develop soccer skills, especially Jin JeolMi who looked gassed from the beginning, **Coach JinChul** laid down the hammer bringing down his team's win with a reality check of the actual competition that they're not ready for, emphasizing the lack of coherent defensive play which he will focus his time on teaching his noob filled team--------!&lt;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!looks like we will start with Challenge League 3.0 before Super League 4.0 with a match that was a month after from today's game.  It will be **BallaDream** vs. **StreamingFighter**!&lt;",

The only reason I have any belief in fc streaming is the fact that their coach is Choi Jin Cheul  who I believe is the best coach in the show. He\u2019s shown that he can train new teams to be hard as hell to beat (he\u2019s regarded as one of Korea\u2019s best center backs in their national team history makes sense). He did this when he coached Korea\u2019s u-17 team in 2015 u17 World Cup and got them out of a group that included England and beat Brazil to make to the quarterfinals. and he has two players that has the stamina and strength to disrupt seogi and kyoung seo which is the best way to beat Balladdream (which is how bottom table teams beat top level teams in soccer). Something tells he gonna enjoy building up fc streaming but that\u2019s just my opinion.",

They have without any practice at least three players who have enough stamina (sf solider, fitness youtuber, and singles inferno girl) in the preview they put the diet YouTuber at goalkeeper so that leaves the soccer creator and the TikTok creator to get up to fitness. It all comes down to them being discipline and making balladdream be perfect in possession. It\u2019s how all relegation sides in soccer survive which is what fc streaming is in cuz they definitely ain\u2019t pushing for promotion\ud83d\ude05",

I was skeptic about this new team before, but with him as a coach, anything is possible. They look like FC TopGirl debut team, but at least 2 of the new players (Deum and KangMi) have a good fitness and strength. The other three players were kinda \"yikes\".

I've been following her YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@user-ih7oy2rc6f) since the end of SI S1, and hoping for her to have more Variety Show appearances.  Glad to see her in the game!  She has her work cut out for her, trying to catch up with fellow SI S1 member [Kang Soyeon](https://www.youtube.com/@kangsoyeon__), and the rest of the league.\n\nAfter seeing the Streaming Fighters play, I'd much rather see more of Anaconda FC's continued growth.  I get that there needs to be turnover and new stories for the show to grow, but I have a soft spot in my heart for Anaconda.  After loosing **badly** to a team of literal 10-year olds in their first few practices, to finally getting their first win was one hell of a journey!  I was really hoping for them to survive, and eventually make it to the Superior League.  I will have to content myself with getting to watch Ang Yea Won more than once every few months (when she posts to her YouTube channel).\n\n----\nNote: I've never been sure if \uc548\uc608\uc6d0 is 'Ang Yea Won' or 'An Ye Won' or some other romanization.  Her YT channel name is \"Ang YeaWon\", but the graphic on the YT page is \"An yea won\".",

            "comment": "Haven't watched yet but I'm just here to say I'm upset that I didn't actually comment anywhere my prediction that An Yea Won was going to be the final member of the new team. I follow her on IG and she has been posting soccer content (practicing, gear, etc) for weeks if not over a month now and it just made sense with Kang SoYeon already on the team and I can totally see Yea Won being a producers dream casting. She's bubbly, pretty, fit/athletic AF, determined and young. Even if she isn't good at soccer she's bound to become a (male) fan favorite due to her visuals and personality.\n\nWhat I will say is I really, really, really, hope that the team doesn't look as bad as they have appeared in the clips I have seen online. My impression off of some short IG stories and the teaser last week is that they are Season 1 level of bad and if that's true, that's a MAJOR mistake on the part of the producers of this show. Unless this show introduced a new even lower league with newbies, teams playing like the season 1 teams played have no place on this show. They will be unbearable to watch, they will get destroyed by even the second worst team in the Challenge League and they will be guaranteed the next team to get suspended. Why is that awful? For two reasons; 1) it means Anaconda, who were developing really well, just got suspended and their development stalled only to be replaced by an awful team that offered even less competition than them, and 2) it means FC StreamingFighter who are desperate for training and game reps (along with airtime to establish a relationship/bond with the viewers) will, like Anaconda now, have their development stalled. Suspension mean no more games but more importantly; no more team training sessions. That means any sort of development the players want has to come out of their own pocket and be scheduled by them. That means any team bonding and team development they want has to be scheduled and paid for by them. It might also mean the show isn't even paying them a salary during their suspension so anything out of pocket isn't even getting reimbursed through pay they make from the show. So who knows how many members of suspended teams will go that extra mile, and even if they do, can they match schedules with their teammates so they can practice/scrimmage as a team? Seems unlikely. The suspension punishment is a punishment that just makes the worst team in the league even worse, all but guaranteeing they are suspended again, unless the team replacing them is truly awful (like FC StreamingFighter might be) in which case Anaconda should be pissed they got replaced by noobs that were a cake walk for all the other teams to beat.\n\n**update:** \n\nWell, I have mixed opinions. I think Gangg Mi has got what it takes to be both a good keeper and a good field player, Euddeum looks good with a high ceiling, and Yea Won looks the same as Euddeum in that way. However, even just purely from a cardio fitness level, Ju Yeon (dieter) is a disaster and Jinjeolme is as well if she doesn't just happen to be sick. That low level of cardio isn't something that can quickly be upgraded. Ju Yeon is barely moving while on defense with a relatively small zone to cover. The show has had women 30lbs+ overweight before but they at least had athleticism or power. Overall, I think the team has potential but it's gonna be a blood bath when they play real teams and they're all but guaranteed to get suspended at the end of the season, which is a shame. IMO if you add a new team they can't be this new to soccer. Balladream having Seogi and Kyoung Seo is how it has to be done for the team to have a shot at being competitive. \n\nI think a good win for FC SF is that Euddeum seems like the type to dive into soccer hardcore, training a lot and if she can use it as content (aka get $$$ while training) then she can dive headfirst into soccer training both in her personal time and as work. Similarly, Yea Won has a brother she is close with (and likely lives with) who trained as a soccer player so she will be getting a ton of training from him and she can at least make a little bit of money back by featuring her training in her YouTube content, like Kang Soyeon already has. Yea Won also seems to just do some modeling and such so I don't think she is particularly busy, unless she has a unknown career (like barista or office worker) to make more money. Those two having a ton of potential, being very fit, showing promise so early on and going hardcore with training on their own dime and time? I wouldn't be shocked to see the \"and 2 months later\" debut match with them looking much, much better. I honestly wouldn't say it's much different for Gangg Mi either. She's fit and has the mind of a military vet so I'd be surprised if she didn't go hard with her training (beyond what the show provides). So I think there's hope for them to not look like a mess and show off some nice development. I just don't think that will be enough to put up a good fight against the current Challenge League teams. \n\nAs for FC Dark Horse, Dayoung is showing what I've seen flashes of before and I'm loving it! Amy as well. Both are young, fit, have some skills and have high ceilings. If they get extensive training and game reps... Seeing Dayoung break through from the backfield and take it herself all the way to the goal? &lt;applause&gt;. Then she breaks through a gaggle of FC SF players and shoots at the goal coming out of the half time break. Then, not much later, she catches a pass perfectly, dribbles a bit then makes an accurate shot on the goal. \n\nI wonder who the new BD player is.",

At least TG players' bodies were conditioned earlier in their life to be active as an idols. It took them almost a year to get where they are now and even that with a few major injuries on the players along the way. Is possible for SF to make it within a few months, with fitness, no major injuries and enough skill, to be competitive in Challenge League? I am less enthusiastic about it. The other teams are already passed the injury-phases of hard training, fitness demands of a game and necessary skill level to compete. Coach JinChul will need a miracle to turn FS into a decent team.",

It made me less worried that one of them would become a 'part-of-the-problem'  kind of personality when they start losing as a team. \n\nHowever &gt;! they do look very newbie as a team with no clue how to defend spaces and I think that's why the coach didn't look very happy even though they won. The plus side is that they have at least 2-3 potentially cracking players with fitness levels and athleticism in the top 5 of this entire show. Especially EudDeum looks like an early Song SoHee but bigger and stronger (and a bit less skilled for now). I also think that twintails (football youtube content) might become a good playmaker, but now she's still quite timid/frail in duels. And starting against Balladream is going to be a nightmare, even if the previews made SF look decent...!&lt;",

WW even had two So sisters who were very skilled players. So far we're not seeing the serious commitment on FS players part, other than those two. One player couldn't even survive the first half (beauty creator), two players are too timid (soccer creator and Single Inferno), and one player is just a goof ball (diet creator). Not a good combination so far.\n\nPreview aside, I think it will be a repeat in history.",

The soccer creator is dating a pro soccer player so it's 1 on 1 lesson all day. The Single Inferno lady and the beauty creator just need to up their fitness. Lastly even though the diet creator is a goof ball, she is a very adorable goof ball. Plus she ain't afraid of the ball.  \n\n\nTL;DR Streaming Fighters have potential but it would be hard for them to win now",

So I suspect this PD did the same thing, but it seems a bit exaggerated here for 2 players to be gassed out before half time (5 minutes!) and on the oxygen bottles.\n\nI mean no one likes to be humiliated on nat television and would at least do some basic cardio as prep for this show. The other much older/less fit newbie players in the earlier episodes weren't as wasted as those 2 after 4 minutes... Unless ofcourse to create interesting content/storylines, as self-aware as content creators are and should be :P",

            "comment": "Thoughts on FC Dark Horse- Coach Seuggeum set them up for guaranteed failure the way he coaches with no practical tactics and given a bunch of overconfident bench players who never played and probably never practiced together before this game. Dayoung was the highlight on the team, the only one who showed improved dribbling and getting past defenders for them. I really hope she gets more playing time on Top Girl going forward. MOST of these scrubs still have a long way from contributing to their teams aside from Dayoung.\n\nThoughts on Streaming Fighter- not sure if this was part of the drawing to assign new coaches but if it was, it was so fake. Just be blunt and say we'll give him all new teams cuz he's so good at developing em, let's see who he fails with... Euddeum, Ang and Kkangmi were everywhere on the field and everyone else on the field I don't see anyone else improving unless their stamina does. That one streamer with a soccer channel is the most disappointing player given her background, then obviously followed by the fat one. But really excited to see how their top 3 develop skills over time but they'll differently have to carry the others. I liked that the coach was on their asses after the win cuz that game was mad ugly with lots of cringe moments. But seeing how Ang didn't remember all that and only heard the good stuff in the post interviews is a potential red flag. I'd also rather see the fat one play goalie- if she's scared she needs to imagine that ball is food. Best case scenario she gets injured n replaced on the show. I really hate her personality and approach to the game. \n\nThoughts on preview- trash talk Balladream might win 10-0?! Looks like the right motivator to have a competitive game. Kyungseo crying- I hope im not even more dissapointed in this team, they really should be in Super league and losing to Streaming Fighter should be embarrassing for them. Im interested to seeing how fast Coach Choi prepped them for this game.",

It will be too hard for her, try to loose some lb, develop stamina and skill. Gaevengers don't do that, and they are comedians. (they takes this sports seriously). Even MinKyoung GV was fit to handle the game when she first joined the team. She might be big but she was also intimidating.

These soccer fundamentals is an issue I see on most teams on the show. Not sure if all Korea gets developed this way but these coaches seem to prioritize team skills over individual, maybe its that way due to the teammates mostly being old/unathletic or just too busy in their careers.",

I've watched euddeum, kkang mi, and one week dieter on other shows before so i already feel a bit of loyalty to them even before watching them play.\n\nWooooooow ballad's new coach is a beast! But his never having coached before will be interesting... \n\nCJC was the perfect choice for Streaming Fighter! \n\nOmg YW from single's inferno!!!! Loved her!!!!! That means she'll play against her castmate Kang So Yeon at some point!!! \n\nThe first game being just 5 days post-team formation is cray given how bad one-week dieter's endurance is and the fact that YW only joined 2 days earlier! This is gonna be a bloodbath \ud83d\ude48\n\nYW's handball \"goal\" was so funny \ud83d\ude02\n\nWatching the new team dying at the time-out whereas the dark horses barely broke a sweat was cray - so uneven. Having said that new team is doing better than i expected!\n\nBae commentator's aviator style glasses remind me so much of lab goggles \n\nOne week dieter may have bad endurance but her field of vision and leadership are great\n\nKkang mi is the strongest player for sure, followed by Euddeum. Both played great this game! Kkang mi gives me heo kyung hee vibes a bit.\n\nI feel like ballad is gonna destroy them next ep but i can't wait for seo x 3 teamwork and seogi as captain! How cute!",

            "comment": "My prediction for the next game. Balladream will crush new Streaming Fighters. One month is not enough time to train to compete with a team that was just in the Super league.\n\nAlso if I were coach JinChul. I might move Kangmi out of GK to forward and put the low stamina/highly vocal one-weekdieter in goal since she can call the defense well. But that\u2019s just an idea. But he\u2019ll probably just keep it the same. EuDDeum will probably be their best player. She has the best kicking ability and is very athletic. Yea-won was good at positioning herself for a pass and she\u2019s also fit.\n\nI will say this though. I think the way the show and SBS over-promotes Seogi is kinda annoying. She\u2019s overrated. She\u2019s got great ball control and passes but she\u2019s not like Lee Jung Eun, she can\u2019t finish and is not a strong shooter. There are other players that are better than her in the league. Kim Bo Kyung, Jung He-in, Kyung-hee, Park Sun Young. Heck, I would even pick her own teammate KyeongSeo over her. She\u2019s the strongest shooter, she\u2019s faster, better stamina, better defender, better at kick-ins, and can even play goalie. So it irks me when they overhype Seogi as the best.",

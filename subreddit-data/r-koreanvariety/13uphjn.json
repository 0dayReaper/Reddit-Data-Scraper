    "postText": "So in the preview of the third episode we can see that a new guy is gonna enter the house and I really don't like this choice. Am I the only one who thinks it's too soon? Let me explain: theoretically the new contestants are introduced to try and create some drama and change the dynamics in the house, but after 3 episodes there haven't been those big dynamics yet, so what's the point of letting a new person in so soon? I would have waited at least for the fifth episode. \n\nThen every time they always let a man in very early and then they let the new female competitor in too late when the dynamics of the house are already very strong. Especially if the new competitor is very attractive I would have waited a bit to give time to those who were already there to show themselves a little more. For example, my favorite contestant is Ji Won but every time he votes for a girl she doesn't reciprocate. It's already hard, was there really a need to introduce a man so soon? If it was me who decided I would first introduce a woman at the beginning of episode 4 maybe to put the girls in a bit of difficulty and then maybe the cool guy at the end of the fifth episode or at the beginning of the sixth.\n\nLet me know what you think",

            "comment": "I feel like the purpose of the two catfishes is normally different. \n\n- The first Catfishes role is to get the ball rolling. In the beginning, since everyone is awkward, there's not a lot of proactive behaviour towards whoever they're interested in. For example, JW has shown at least some interest in JY but hasn't made a single move towards her yet. The catfish that comes in at this time is normally really proactive and sets off alarm bells for the other people. This new guy could be the catalyst for a lot of guys in the house. That being said, I do feel like this catfish could have come in after the second date\n\n- The second Catfishes role is to shake up love lines. By introducing a new person when people have started to settle down in their couple or lack of couple, love lines are tested and even possibly new connections can be made. This role can be less successful as it can be hard to grab the attention of someone who's showing interest in someone else. Normally, this catfish is someone really charming in various ways. I hope this catfish gets to come in a bit earlier this season",

So, I'm confused right now why they decided to introduce a catfish early this season, like they did in season 2.\n\nMaybe because it's better to put catfishes earlier than later in the show? That's what I think could be one of the reasons. They're probably thinking of adding the female catfish a bit early too, so she'll have more time to develop a connection with the members in the signal house.",

            "comment": "Well, some of us were actually asking the PDnims to add the catfishes earlier because otherwise the bond of the initial group is too much. These days even in Chinese dating shows, the catfishes are introduced faster and this helps them integrate with the first six or so housemates.\n\nA nice example of this is when **Sun Xiu from Twinkle Love Season 2 (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81 \u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b63)** was added in like Episode 1 Part 2, during their trip to Macao: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFBC-aR2tmk&amp;t=1324s\n\nMy God, I forgot how nice **Wu Shuyang (Little Wu or \u5c0f\u5434)** and Sun Xiu were with those two guys as they stuttered, lol. \n\nMaybe if one of the initial housemates, Zeng Chenchen/etc. (\u66fe\u6668\u6668), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ken79H81pc, wasn't censored/removed from the show, Sun Xiu and Shuyang would've had less screen time. As supposedly a lot of people liked Zeng Chenchen as she kinda looked like Red Velvet Irene. We don't know how Zeng Chenchen was in the show as later on (during the time of Episode 1/etc. premiere) it was revealed she was blackmailing an older married dude? Lmao.\n\nAnyway, so they redid Episode 1 after it already aired, and from then on you see these zoomed in shots that exclude her, or like if she's not able to be blurred (they often just removed (using clone stamp edits, etc.) her when it was mainly a still shot or slow scene), then they overlay meme-worthy images over her figure, rofl. For example, a few times they put a tree to cover her whole body, lol.\n\nBut ya if there's a lot of people already and they have certain visuals or say storyline, then a few months later when they're organizing what stories they want to focus on, the editors and writers will prefer their scenes. Like right now Twinkle Love Season 3 (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81 \u7b2c\u4e09\u5b63), /r/twinklelove3, has lacking visuals I guess, waiting on the upcoming housemates. \n\nWell there's that Tibetan girl from Sichuan with curly brown hair, her name's Zeren Yongji. Otherwise the boys from Twinkle Love Season 3 got crazy good visuals (Qian Yifeng and Teng Guangzheng (Zhengzheng looks like Kang Haneul, it's crazy) are classic handsome guys), so the producers messed up with the casting. This happens often with I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO (/r/IamSolo) where the visuals are imbalanced or tilted to one side, and so you see them give up when they see the opposite group's visuals, rofl.\n\n---\n\nHold let me try to bring this back to actually Heart Signal 4. ADHD/lack of focus strikes again, smh.\n\nWhat I was going to say is that the visuals of the catfish or fourth/fifth/etc. member has to be really good in order for the current housemates dynamics to be broken. This is the law in real life too. People just get tempted due to visuals, and more rarely, personality, intelligence, etc.\n\nFortunately the Heart Signal 4 male catfish is a &gt;!model or something like that!&lt; and so we don't need to worry about his visuals. Sometimes in these dating shows when they introduce a catfish or later member, their visuals are just not up to par even if they are supposedly a &gt;!model and so on!&lt; and so they end up not fulfilling their intended purpose of switching up the pairings and so on.\n\nAs for the Heart Signal 4 female catfish, apparently she's tall or something like that and so that's already an automatic disqualifier for some of the male housemates. This reminds me of the current I Am Solo Season 14 for the ~40 years old cast, the males were really picky about not having any interest with females older than them, even if the female housemates were financially, visually, etc. better than the younger ones.\n\nAnd from what I could glean, the Heart Signal 4 female catfish is not as attractive as you might expect. Well for me anyway the Korean Heart Signal series has had lackluster female catfishes and I strongly favor some of the initial housemates. \n\nIn the Chinese version of Heart Signal it's a bit different as there was somebody like Yang Yang/4th girl from Heart Signal Chinese Version Season 3, and she was barely seen at all because the 4th boy was found to be like a cheater/et cetera, rofl. This is her, don't click unless you know the ending of Heart Signal Chinese Version Season 2 (and 3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvgvE2BTlwI\n\nEven in the Chinese versions of dating shows or their Chinese dating shows in general, a lot of the catfishes are not as attractive as you think and so they make less impact with the housemates from the start.\n\nFor example, it's extremely rare that you'd see somebody with Ming's visuals and specs, wait, let me copy/paste more info about her below.\n\nWhat these dating shows need, especially for the older females since they're often dismissed by the male housemates due to age (and visuals/etc.) gap, is somebody like Ming from Shanghai Sharelife (the Chinese version of Terrace House): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY2x4Y8W8lU&amp;t=62s\n\nMing entered Shanghai Sharelife by vlogging with her phone, who else has done that. Don't remember now, there must be one from other Korean/Chinese/Japanese/etc. dating shows, but not as iconic as Ming.\n\nHer storyline in Shanghai Sharelife was a bit underwhelming but the ending was insane, like wtf, lmao. Not gonna spoil it, just gonna say it's not what you think at all, literally so random.\n\nMing has everything: solid career in finance, great personality, nice face visuals, insane body visuals, stylish af fashion, et cetera. Like they lucked out so much with her, wish there was somebody comparable.\n\n---\n\nSo it's really the casting people that need to be on top of their game. But yes, the people that would agree to be on such shows like this need to have a certain schedule and so the producers have their casting pools limited. Maybe especially more so for the catfish people as they will have less screen time and integration with the initial housemates.\n\nKorean/Chinese/etc. dating show visuals: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/12ijnjc/dating_shows/jfve2v6/\n\nLove Village (Ai no Sato) and I Am Solo, and behind the scenes about East Asian dating shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveVillage1/comments/13o5u8p/more_people_being_exposed_as_actors_on_japanese/jl75998/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/111tsh6/redditor_who_implied_that_hes_friends_with_nadine/j8gz6m3/\n\nProduct placement or advertisements in dating/cohabitation/etc. shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/1264tt5/why_is_you_just_driving_around/je88b7g/\n\n---\n\nFWIW, I have no idea why people like Jiyoung as her face is so altered/modified/etc. for me, she has this uncanny valley look, likely because of her big eyes. Nobody has said that directly here, IIRC, and so I'll take the L on that one. Even before her multiple scandals about boyfriend, bread allergy, or whatever it is, I was like wtf why did the Heart Signal production team choose to focus so much on Jiyoung, especially during the first teaser video. Cuz you'd expect them to market a strong visuals game, and also not as blatant as the amount of screen time they gave her with those teasers, rofl.\n\nBut that just probably means she has a crazy storyline coming up. Some speculate she's gonna be the girl with the love triangles and so on. Or they really fancy that type of short-haired kawaii visual.\n\nThe only time that short-haired kawaii visual has worked on me in recent memory is Shuyang from Twinkle Love 2. \u5c0f\u5434/Little Wu, jiayou/fighting!\n\nOtherwise they either have too much plastic surgery that it's distracting, or they just have certain phenotypes (I'm into genetics and so it's easy for me to visualize the bone structure and so on, like I grew up in Asia and so I can kinda predict their visuals when they're in the ajussi/ajumma stages, lol) that can't be changed with hairstyle, fashion, makeup, et cetera. And sadly I'm way too into the visuals standards life and as such if their appearance fails to appeal to me, I just roll my eyes (lol) because I know the male housemates and other male/female viewers will somehow still like those type of visuals. Everybody's preferences are different, there's nothing wrong with selecting specific people, but sometimes it gets really predictable and boring, lmao.\n\nFml, point is catfishes need to be like say Dana/\ub2e4\ub098 from Love Catcher in Seoul (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \uc11c\uc6b8), Choi Yihyun (\ucd5c\uc774\ud604) from EXchange/Transit Love 2 (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc5602), et cetera in order to have a chance at breaking up the current couples, lol.\n\nI've said it a few times now and will always say it until it gets triumphed/irrelevant/et cetera, but imagine if the cast for Heart Signal 4 were the housemates from Love Catcher in Bali. That is literally the visuals end game type of thing.\n\nLike after watching the trailer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0isy6O5UcNo) for Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac), the bar was just set so high, to outer space/interdimensional (UAP/USO/etc.) territory (UFO/UAP/USO/etc. stuff by NASA in May 31. And also the congressional hearings and so on later this June.), for the visuals of Heart Signal/Single's Inferno/EXchange or Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560)/other Korean dating shows.\n\nLove Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac) has unparalleled (female) visuals and so on compared to other dating shows, it's like the difference between heaven and earth.\n\nBelow are the direct links to TVING/Love Catcher in Bali clips, don't worry it's not really spoilers as they're just chilling.\n\nThese are the female housemates of Love Catcher in Bali: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpPl9mP35ik\n\nThese are the male housemates of Love Catcher in Bali: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VawZKpDWIY4\n\nSo imagine if Jeonghyeon was competing with Mingyu and Jiwon of Heart Signal 4. And then Hyojin would probably be one of the initial female housemates and fan favorite for sure. Same with Suji. As Suji could've been an insane catfish if she entered in a salacious outfit like Taeeun did for Love Catcher in Bali. But yes, Taeeun would've probably been the catfish for Heart Signal 4 due to her Lee Hyori/etc. tanned girl vibes, lol.\n\nSigh, post went too long.",

                    "comment": "To be honest, I don't need the male cast to be made up only of super handsome guys, it's enough for me to have one who inspires me with vibes as a protagonist and then I tend to be interested only in that contestant and his relationships. For this reason it is very annoying if after 2 days a guy who is 10 times more handsome enters the house, because having not yet created even a little deeper relationships, it is normal that the girls focus more on the newcomer since he is more handsome than the others usually and it is also new (and it is known that new things as well as new people arouse more interest). Usually then, in reality shows girls tend to change love interests more easily, especially if the new love interest is more handsome (which is ok, it's normal), while boys tend to start developing feelings faster and therefore it is difficult for them to change their interest, which is also the reason why very often in the final choices it is  the girl who has to choose between two or three competitors, while the males have already decided (it's not always like this but often it is). For this reason, in my opinion, the female catfish should enter first (but even in the case of the girl, not too soon to give time to the initial competitors to have a few moments together) and then the man also because, as you say, the female catfish usually is not particularly better than the initial females competitors, instead the male catfish is very often (not always) a very attractive guy (I'm not saying that he should enter late, but not too early because you can't break couples if couples have not formed yet due to fault lack of time).\n\n\rAs for Ji young, I too, being a boy, find her attractive but her way of doing seems a bit fake to me (probably I'm wrong). \n\nAs already said , my favourite competitor is Ji Won who has already sent 2 signals to 2 different girls and none of them reciprocated him, then with this new male competitor who enters I hope he doesn't become a background character who has to settle for the girl who vote for him from the first episode(then if as you say the new female contestant will be very tall, then probably she won't go out with Ji Won and therefore there is even more chance that he will become a contestant with little screentime because . has no love interests reciprocated ).",

                            "comment": "Oh ya lol, I know what you mean about vicariously living through the characters, that's why I always watch slice of life or chill dramas/shows too, haha.\n\nAnd yup, this is also like reality, remember how in dating apps girls know they have a lot of options and so they pick and choose. This is like a main theme of those disgruntled boys that post sad/hateful/etc. things all the time, lol. But sadly it is just the truth/real life or a numbers game. Due to the environment, gender ratio, expectations, etc. as a boy you basically have to put way more effort into online/etc. dating compared to girls.\n\nThen for these dating shows, some of the boys get randomly obsessed/invested with a particular girl even though they know that most of them (both girls and boys) are likely there for exposure/to build their brand/advertise something/etc.\n\nTake for example Jinyoung/Dex from Single's Inferno 2, even he himself admits that it feels like an obsession when he's still thinking about his initial connection with &gt;!Seulki!&lt; especially after it's been several months. Imagine if a girl confesses that to Jang Sungkyu (from Workman, Queendom, etc.) or some other MC/host, the responses/reactions or reception will be different. Unless we really see another similar type of kinda love at first sight that they both had during their Paradise date.\n\nThere's just different standards for boys and girls and as such we can't do much about how the producers and audience want to approach the changes or directions they want to proceed with, especially for the future shows.\n\nThankfully these days for both Korean and Chinese dating shows they have the male and female catfishes entering in a similar timeframe, barring scheduling conflicts or something. Before it was a bit spread out and so it was unfair for the even later housemate/catfish.\n\n---\n\nI forgot to mention it in the post (it reached 10 000 characters, smh I type too much over nothing, lol) earlier, but nowadays they actually have the housemates meet before they actually formally enter the house/buildings they will film in. This is more so for the Chinese dating shows, where they can text and so on each other beforehand, but this past year or so the Korean dating shows have also started doing it.\n\nLike I was wondering if they were gonna do that for Heart Signal 4 as for the Season 5 of Heart Signal China, they somehow did that (being allowed to text and go through social media, etc. before meeting each other) successfully enough.\n\nAnyway, ya I feel you, sometimes people get way too invested in someone but then the other person they're interested in is also clearly waiting for the catfish or other opportunities. And it sucks because then their storyline gets cut short, like they eventually fade into the background as their scenes uninteresting or have little impact on the overarching storyline that the editors wanted to portray for the whole show.\n\nFor Jiyoung, there's definitely too much aegyo (forced cuteness) and other perfunctory or expected gestures and actions, but I actually thought she was okay in that front as it's not often you see the girls being more proactive than the boys. Like for example in last season, it was only really Gaheun of Heart Signal 3 that was making the moves, and like some people were complaining heavily about the biased/overdone screen time of Jihyun, lol.\n\nLike I actually like Jiyoung's voice and so on, but the stupid high visuals standards side of my brain is just so disappointed that they want to focus on her. As I'm a person that prefers minimal/naturalistic makeup and less plastic surgery, but if the surgery is done pretty well, then I also like it as that's the point of doing those procedures anyway and the results of overly high standards of society.\n\nAnd so it's making me biased or not as welcoming as I should be (I'm a huge Heart Signal/Terrace House/these types of dating shows fan) and it sucks because it's near guaranteed that Jiyoung will have the most interesting storyline by the way they're setting the show, teasers, hell they even leaked the filming of the dates right now. Check Youtube/Twitter/etc. they have pictures of Jiyoung walking with the male catfish, Mingyu, etc. alongside the various camera/production crew members, lmao.\n\n---\n\nI like Jiwon a lot too, he and I are a bit similar with our cheeriness/et cetera, lol. And like half or so of my extended family members are doctors, nurses, caregivers, teachers, etc. and when I was young apparently I wanted to be a doctor (wtf lmao), so it's easy to relate in that way too. But I'm beholden to the visual standards gods as last year (2022) had basically no visuals couple for the vast majority of the Chinese/Korean/etc. dating shows. And somehow I'm still hoping it'll break the curse for this 2023 year, but reality is disappointing and so it probably won't, rofl.\n\nPlus, I sorta identify with the quietness or reservedness of Mingyu too, he's really chill, there's always a guy like that these days in the dating shows, haha. Just taking it easy you know, the relaxing escapism.\n\nThis was my expectation during the teaser videos some weeks ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/139bd4a/heart_signal_4_second_teaser_video/jj1upfq/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/13q991t/heart_signal_4_episode_2_230524/jliuh4l/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/13jo40c/heart_signal_4_episode_1_230517/jkijuhh/\n\nLike this scene, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95SLY5leyZE&amp;t=69s, with Jiwon and Jimin is wild if it's not a red herring or like a one time type of thing. At first I thought it'd be later as there's no way they'd get that close just in the first few days, but with Jimin's personality or penchant for being daring/proactive/assertive/etc. then it's totally believable that they'd do a hug like that.\n\nHonestly, I didn't expect the Jimin x Mingyu scene (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95SLY5leyZE&amp;t=70s) to appear so early but that's also why the ship is sailing for me as it looks like Mingyu is focused on her too.\n\nI think you should try watching Heart Signal (Chinese Version) 5 if you haven't already. They have let's just say (don't want to spoil it) even couples there, that's why people truly love it, kinda like how Season 2 of both Heart Signal Korea and China are considered the best, some people are saying that with Season 5 of the Chinese version now.\n\nOh and Twinkle Love Season 2 is also sorta the same thing, they kinda have a more even screen time or say pairings, and so it's pretty wholesome to watch.\n\nBecause yup, it genuinely sucks seeing the housemates not have reciprocated feelings no matter how much effort one person tries for. It undoubtedly is just the cruel visuals standards or sometimes it's just a personality or say specifications (wealth/education/etc.) conflict too even though they don't outright say/display it. \n\nYou can see a much raw version of such reality/pragmatism in I Am Solo and that's kinda what makes it the show so fun even if the visuals are often disappointing with I Am Solo. As again, yup some of them know they have way more options/selection outside of the show.\n\nPhew, I overanalyze over such casual slice of shows again, I'm overthinking it, lmao. But yes, sorry again if that was too long of a post/reply, fml.\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and Kdramas, East Asian films, et cetera, and more info on where to watch them**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/13dfyum/bring_them_back_please/jjlijqw/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/12qlu3e/its_just_my_impression_or_the_are_really_few/jgqusuv/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/12ccjku/can_someone_give_me_a_list_of_korean_variety/jf16a56/\n\n**More info on Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81) and other traveling/culture/et cetera shows**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10pyock/im_just_sad_terrace_house_is_gone_i_miss_them_all/j6rhk67/\n\n---\n\nMore direct link and overview of the shows similar to Single's Inferno (Heart Signal needs to be in international Netflix instead of just Netflix Korea for more discussion, lol): https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/102skks/nineteen_to_twenty_1920_a_new_netflix_youth/j2vkckf/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/13fm7qu/shows_similar_to_singles_inferno/jjx8kgv/\n\nWhere to watch Kdramas, Korean variety shows, and so on (basically Viki, VIU, Disney+, Netflix, etc.): https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10fpzhx/overall_thoughts_on_love_catcher_in_bali/j5cmhaw/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/13bmtin/anyone_know_where_can_i_watch_the_below_korean/jjbtnuz/\n\n---\n\nThis is some other Kdramas/Korean films/East Asian media stuff with romance, slice of life, cohabitation, and so on: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/11omuh3/where_to_find_comfort_now/jbuxtm5/\n\nSummaries of those Kdramas/East Asian media stuff with romance, slice of life, et cetera: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/11omuh3/where_to_find_comfort_now/jbuz31j/",

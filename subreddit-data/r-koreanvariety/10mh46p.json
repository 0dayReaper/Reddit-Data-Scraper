I found out about it after RM was announced as the MC and I thought the concept was excellent. I love going on discussion threads after I watch episodes, but I was surprised to not find one for this show. There were one or two threads for the first few episodes on r/Bangtan but even the discussion there is pretty much limited to how RM was like on that episode. I\u2019d love to know your review if you watch the show. Also, how can I find earlier seasons? I suspect the name was translated differently.",

As someone who identifies as being intellectually curious, I love how these experts in their own respective fields come together and have such deep discussions - their storytelling skills AND overall how knowledgeable they are when chiming in to add on to each other are so impressive. I really respect how much prep/research they put into choosing one person to discuss per theme and genuinely reflect on what the broader implications are for telling that person\u2019s story. The production crew also does a wonderful job supplementing this work with footage/graphics as well.\n\nDirector Jang Hang Jun and RM are an unlikely duo for hosting, but they work! It\u2019s so cute how the experts and JHJ casually sneak in fanboying/fangirling moments over BTS, haha, but it\u2019s not overdone. JHJ and RM also add little bits of commentary that are not overdone and feel greedy for airtime, but are natural and help enhance the content.\n\nSome may feel this show is boring, but I\u2019d just say it\u2019s more of a calm talkshow where you really come for a mellow ride. Your brain will get stimulated :)",

I like both his music and his work as the MC and I wouldn\u2019t have known this show if it wasn\u2019t for him. One of the reasons why I like this show is not overusing RM for exposure. The clips they share on YouTube are more clickbaity with him on the thumbnail, but for the duration of the episode his contributions are very balanced and he doesn\u2019t step over his boundaries as the MC. Jang Hang-jun is also an excellent host, I do agree that they are a good duo. You do get the sense that the show is more about ideas the experts bring. \nI think the experts are also well-balanced. Of course they are at their best when they talk about their areas of expertise, but sometimes they connect something from a completely different domain and show a bigger picture. Where else could I learn about how dioramas are used in both crime scene investigations AND publishing houses? The overall vibe of the show is very wholesome too. I need to praise the editing as well. They speak for hours apparently, but everything can be condensed into one episode. I guess my favorite expert on the show is Kim Young-ha. As an author he took a different route in life compared to others, but seeing how he researches different fields just out of curiosity or to integrate realities into his books made me really admire him. But I see how each of them come prepared. I added more books to my reading list than I anticipated when I started watching this show. \nSorry I basically reiterated what you said, but I cannot agree more.",

And the perspectives shared on the show are more progressive than I thought. \n\nI think most of the variety shows I've watched in the past aren't this serious, so I had some preconceived notions that were definitely challenged by watching this show. I haven't been able to keep up with the show weekly but I've been watching it when I have a good chunk of free time.\n\nI think it's difficult to discuss the show on the bangtan subreddit because it's difficult to find a legitimate way to watch the show for most people. That subreddit can crack down on stuff like that which not a bad thing imo.",

But I like it because the experts told many things of many stories from their perspectives, it made me not judge things in advance and think more carefully.\n\nThe original concept of the show is a travel and talk show, but it changed because of Covid-19, so it's just a talk show now.\n\n&gt;!(TMI: The show starts with \"The Dictionary of Useless Knowledge\" and it has 3 seasons; the second starts with \"The Dictionary of Useful Crime Knowledge\" - !&lt;[\uc54c\uc4f8\ubc94\uc7a1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S2yl9E8asI)&gt;! and it has 2 seasons, and the third is \"!&lt;[The Dictionary of Useless Human Knowledge](https://dramanice.ac/drama/the-dictionary-of-useless-human-knowledge-2022-detail)&gt;!\"; I guess from the last ep that we will have season 2 and I really hope with same casts because Yang Jungwoo likes to change some members for new seasons.)!&lt;\n\nI saw that you like Writer Kim Youngha, he was also in The Dictionary of Useless Knowledge season 1 and 3. The show was popular even before Kim Namjoon enters. But I think PD is also clever for choosing Namjoon too, he can bring international fans to watch the show and the show also has Eng sub for the first time!!! (Shinjub and Beomjub hasn't any subtitles T\\_T)\n\nI like Physicist Kim Sangwook, I especially like the topic \"[Richard Feynman](https://youtu.be/REqqIINkmQo?list=PLYXqaUwf8raoNtb3Zk0k7i74rzxXFppql)\", it makes me know that a physicist can have love as well. For the review of this season, I feel that Lee Ho and Sim Chaekyung have too little screentime on the program, Lee Ho's storytelling style is quite interesting to me and the female member controversy has been an issue for a long time; unfortunately, that it's always one member for each season (Shinjub3, Beomjub1-2, Injub1).\n\n&gt;!I knew where to watch The Dictionary of Useless Knowledge (!&lt;[S1](https://dramanice.ac/drama/the-dictionary-of-useless-knowledge-detail)&gt;! !&lt;[S2](https://dramanice.ac/drama/the-dictionary-of-useless-knowledge-season-2-detail)&gt;! !&lt;[S3](https://dramanice.ac/drama/the-dictionary-of-useless-knowledge-season-3-detail)&gt;!), warning! - the show hasn't any subtitles, but The Dictionary of Useful Crime Knowledge is quite hard to find.

                    "comment": "Thank you for your detailed comment. The previous seasons sound just as interesting, it's a bummer that they don't have subtitles. I guess I must learn Korean or wait for automatic translation systems to improve. I've actually known Kim Youngha before the show, I read his novel Diary of A Murderer last year. I figured he must be a famous Korean author to have his work translated into so many languages, but I didn't expect him to be such an interesting person. By the way, let me promote a crime drama from my country. If anyone who reads this enjoyed that book, they should definitely check out the Emmy-winner [Persona](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7920978/). \n\nI agree with your comment that Lee Ho and Sim Chaekhyung have too little screen time.  I especially like Lee Ho's calm demeanor and, being a fan of the crime genre, would love to learn more about forensic medicine. Sim Chaekhyung also breaks the image of the scientist who's only knowledgeable in her own field. I admire how both of them seem well-read in literature for example. Seeing how the second season was on crime knowledge, I wish we could get Lee Ho's version of it too. \n\nI think they covered Richard Feynman quite well. I read Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman 7-8 years ago, but I was able to recall many things in the book while watching the show. I might actually re-read it. Of course, I don't know your background or age, but [The Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics) is an excellent textbook that is [freely available online](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu). You might find that interesting. \n\nI have been taking my sweet time with the episodes, so I'm on episode 8 now. I decided to take a little break to finish Frankenstein before continuing, so I won't get any spoilers. It was a book I bought a few months ago but couldn't get to. We can say that the show is helpful in going through my reading list too. I didn't even entertain the possibility of a second season and I didn't know before reading your comment. So, I'm quite excited! Hopefully, they will have more female representation this time. Assuming RM will be in the military next year, a female host also sounds very exciting.",

As for the discussions, I don\u2019t find them quite Korea-centric. If anything, I sometimes think the topics they discuss are too western. I can remember only a couple instances where they brought up famous Koreans, like Hong Dong-gil and the person who specializes in space law.

Idk what made me start it but oh boy I'm so glad I did! It completely indulges my inner geekiness!!! Definitely with you here that this is probably the best variety show I've ever watched. \n\nI'm on Ep 8 and can't bear to watch Ep 9 because it will be the last :( Also went looking for earlier seasons but can't find them! I found this thread instead and am very glad to know there are others who enjoyed this as much as I did :)",

I would say that for the first half, I was really taken with Sim Chaekyung, the astronomer. She is elegant, confident and clearly has a deep love for her job. I also have a deep fascination with space, and am pretty stoked that she's personally involved in an upcoming mission (from the ground). But for the second half, Kim Sang Wook, the physicist really grew on me. I think after the Feynman episode, he began to endear me greatly (I was crying already, and cried harder when he choked up). And whenever he went into one of his rabbit holes while explaining concepts or evens in later episodes, I would just sit there with the biggest smile. Like yes sir, tell me everything.\n\nAs for the discussion, I really liked the episode where they discussed figures who will change the future. I learned so much in such a short period of time. I genuinely had no idea we had concepts like space elevators or multi-planetary migration or terraforming in mind. It was a nice follow-up from Sim Chaekyung's sharing about the seamstresses at NASA, which was such a fantastic story! I also loved that we got to see Duchamp in Kim Sang Wook's eyes - that was very unexpected, for a physicist to advocate for artists in a future dominated by AI. \n\nThere are other stories I felt truly invested in. The witch trials one enraged me - I also loved Lee Ho's explanation of \"femina\" (and his other etymological explanations in the series). The Roebling story was as heartbreaking as it was inspiring (from the perspective of early engineering, and later as a fellow woman looking at Emily Roebling). I loved Kim Young Ha's description of the psychological state of Alzheimer's patients too - it was so tenderly put, and he's such a gentle soul with so much knowledge. I loved how he had in-depth knowledge about everyone's topics. What is he even!\n\nGosh I shall stop here T\\_T",

He was more robotic at the beginning and, as the host highlighted, we saw the soft side of him more and more. As discussed in other comments, he sometimes does come out as arrogant in my opinion, but those moments are in earlier episodes. \n\nThe episode where they discussed figures who will change the future can actually be my favorite too. It either that or the award episode, but keep in mind that I\u2019m still on episode 8. I\u2019ve been a space nerd since childhood, but I did not know anything about how spacesuits were built at the time. I\u2019m actually thinking of looking more into \u201csmaller\u201d achievements. As for Duchamp, it was unexpected that he was introduced by Kim Sang-wook. I wish they talked more about art. Maybe in upcoming seasons\u2026\n\nI tried to look up the etymology of femina, but failed to find the same derivation online. Maybe I should check out The Malleus Maleficarum. As a woman in engineering, Emily Roebling was a striking person for me as well. I\u2019m glad to have heard her story. I will definitely share it with others. I hope it gets made into a movie. \n\nI\u2019ve been always scared of Alzheimer\u2019s, but I have never had to think deeply about the implications and how it\u2019s become an even more serious issue with increased life expectancy. I also had no idea we have made basically no progress on it even after 150 years. Truly scary. \n\nSome of the topics discussed on the show, I already knew a lot about them, but for others, I could spot gaps in my knowledge. I\u2019m planning to fill those gaps, so for me, watching The Encyclopedia of Useless Knowledge is exciting on another level.",

Thank heavens for RM being on this show for it to get subbed so well and regularly /\\\n\nWould recommend to anyone who's a fan of JTBC's Abnormal Summit, and vice versa. It's basically this show between different countries' representatives who discuss a current affair issue followed up by a debate over a topic/question, based on their country's values/culture. Most eps have a guest who stars as the Korean rep as well. There are three MCs who are unbelievably good at MC-ing. Has way more chemistry, liveliness, banter and back-forth (some of the best comedic moments on kvariety I swear). Despite being an informative show, I've rewatched so much of it.

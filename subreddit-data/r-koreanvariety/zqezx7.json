In EDEN, social norms and customs are done away with: Contestants speak to each other informally and without the honorifics usually used in everyday Korean language. The amount of information they are able to learn about one another is also limited, meaning that hierarchies cannot form easily here!\n\nWhile the first season saw the constants having fun in the sun, the second season promises a new range of pulse-racing games and activities \u2013 with a darker and sexier vibe than the first season. Three celebrity guides \u2013 [Lee Hong Ki](https://www.instagram.com/skullhong12/), [Yoon Bomi](http://instagram.com/__yoonbomi__), and [Simeez](https://www.instagram.com/_simeez/) \u2013 are on hand to watch events unfurl at the EDEN house and provide their commentary. With the romantic vibe turned all the way up to 10, will our hosts be able to contain their excitement...as the contestants\u2019 hunt for love intensifies?\n\n# Panel\n\n- Lee Hong Gi (FT Island) [skullhong12](https://www.instagram.com/skullhong12/)\n- Yoon Bomi (A-Pink) [\\_\\_yoonbomi\\_\\_](http://instagram.com/__yoonbomi__)\n- Simeez (SWF) [_simeez](https://www.instagram.com/_simeez/)\n- Seon Ji Hyun (Eden S1) [ooooog0](https://www.instagram.com/ooooog0) - Guest panel in Ep. 3.\n- Kim Chul Min (Eden S1) [maisonchul](https://www.instagram.com/maisonchul/) - Guest panel in Ep. 4.\n\n# Cast\n\n## Men\n\n- Jo Egeon [j0ysky](https://www.instagram.com/j0ysky/) - 31 y.o., Acting tutor/instructor\n- Kim Dohyun [1031daily](https://www.instagram.com/1031daily/) - 34 y.o., Make-up artist, Race car driver (hobby)\n- Kim Soomin [ssuuuuumin_](https://www.instagram.com/ssuuuuumin_/) - 34 y.o., Restaurant CEO, Poli-Sci Sungkyunkwan University (class of 2015)\n- Kim Kangrae [kang\\_rae\\_kim](https://www.instagram.com/kang_rae_kim/) - 25 y.o.

Ever since that Lana date everything has been going downhill for both him and Lana. This episode had to have been so draining for him especially with Chaehee tryna guilt trip him and paint him like he was the bad guy. Both Egeon and Lana would fit perfectly for shows like Heart Signal rather than Eden. That Eden atmosphere just looks so exhausting",

So unpredictable. \n\nThat said, it feels way too suffocating and less feel good dating show. Genuinely there are so many annoying, pushy and persistent contestants. Do Hyun, Chae Hee, Soomin have made the atmosphere so awkward. But I guess it was the same last season too. \n\nI definitely empathised with Seo Ah. That would kill any good feelings I had for someone if I didn\u2019t feel ready and I can see why she felt offended. It\u2019s just annoying when someone treats you without proper respect. I knew Do Hyun could be handsy since he was on Bed on the Beach as well, but I thought he would be a bit different with someone he wants to date seriously. Kang Rae seems sweet but so inexperienced in some of his interactions but who knows, maybe they could be a good pair. \n\nEgeon, I just feel really bad for him. It is so annoying how everyone kept separating him and Lana but also all the girls be guilting him about who he picks for dates when it\u2019s his choice. Chae Hee literally getting all delusional and making him look like the bad guy was so wtf. I feel bad for the girl but I felt worse for Egeon. There\u2019s only so much walking on eggshells to politely reject someone. Ditto to his situation with Lana, it\u2019s hard to pursue someone when everyone else seems to be helping Soomin get her. I do feel like she could\u2019ve just initiated more with Egeon instead of just spending her energy on avoiding Soomin. His date with Seoyeon was cute but I feel like he should just be alone since I feel like he doesn\u2019t really like Seoyeon romantically, she was his only remaining option for the date and they had fun. \n\nSoomin should really back off now but I don\u2019t think he will with his whole spiel about it being only 2 days left and he still picks Lana. Bless Lana for choosing no one, though I felt like she needn\u2019t give up Egeon. How tiring. \n\nI\u2019m curious about what happens on this show but I ship no one lol.",

They had a ton of chemistry during their bed scene and also he did say he wanted to date her if he got the chance. Which is she called him out during the truth and dare game. Saying he didn\u2019t see her as a \u201cwomen\u201d was a cop out.\nTheir date was so natural and had a ton of chemistry. He felt very comfortable, unlike Lana\u2019s date. Idk\u2026 \nAs for Chae Hee omggggg girl needs to stop those tears were so unnecessary. I think she thought she was the second girl in line.",

                            "comment": "Hm I think no one owes anyone a date but he really should stop promising people to go on dates with them. He seems like a nice guy/people pleaser so he makes these promises in the moment. But for example, I can understand why he took Lana on the first date because they were team mates and he was interested in her then he came back and expressed that, so I don\u2019t think it was wrong. They\u2019re on a dating show and can explore going on dates with who they\u2019re interested in at that point in time. \n\nI think the dramatic yet frustrating element of Eden format is that someone else decides the bed arrangement which can create new opportunities but also cause rifts. A bed date can mean a lot but it can also mean nothing if you\u2019re not interested in the other person.",

I will admit tho I am upset by the fact that things aren\u2019t looking too good for Lana and Egon \u2639\ufe0f I really liked their chemistry but oh well. I 10000% agree with Egon not liking Seoyeon romantically he literally said the first day that he doesn\u2019t see her as a woman. I got major older brother vibes throughout their date \ud83e\udee3 it seemed too friendly and not romantic at all. With Lana he was nervous and shy but with Seo Yeon it seemed like he was with a friend or something didn\u2019t really get date vibes. But I think he chooses Seo Yeon as his bedmate. I don\u2019t think Lana and Egon are totally over though because at the start of episode one there was a scene of Lana and egon holding hands, I am guessing on a date, which we have not yet seen.",

He moves a bit too quickly and doesn\u2019t seem to take the girls emotions into consideration. \n\nOn this episode it was the kiss in the other show I think it was snuggling with a girl in bed and you could tell she was awkward and not super comfortable about it. \n\nUpdate: Also I don\u2019t want to spread hate so in the nicest was possible I hope that Somin and Chaehee stops pursuing ppl who simply don\u2019t want them. The heart wants what it wants but at this point Lana and Egon have made it super clear they\u2019re not in to them. I find it kinda mean to keep putting them in uncomfortable situation. It\u2019s almost harassment atp \ud83d\ude02",

Dohyun gave me icky feelings from the start, and now he just seems so selfish?\n\nEgeon was really sweet to interject and remind the two that Seoah was in a difficult position, so to not burden her too much. He seems so thoughtful with the way he handles everyone, but that probably just makes him more exhausted.\n\nLana had been tired since that day she was sleeping in the daytime while everyone hung out. I was so sad for her when she decided she wanted to spend the night alone. I'm so onboard with Egeon and Seoyeon, but I feel sad for Lana. If only Soomin wasn't such a creepy bully.\n\nNo comments on Chae Hee. Like..?? Huhhh??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I felt sad seeing Lana say she wanted to sleep alone, because she seemed so tired. But I felt proud for her for being honest and just deciding not to play the game. Good for her!!",

There were two days in between where Chae Hee was constantly harassing him, and Soomin kept overdoing it with both Lana and Egeon. Two days is enough time for him to just be done with it. So while, I understand Lana feeling blindsided and exhausted, I don't think Egeon was cowardly for choosing Soyeon.",

What made this especially bad was they even had a comment from the panel (in an insert-box) during one of the PPLs in the latest episode, which seems particularly bad.  That's attempting to blur the line a bit too much.\n\nAt least with the PPL's in Chinese TV, there's such a jarring contrast in acting styles and camera quality that it's clear when something is an embedded advertisement.  And with Chinese PPL's with the panel members never use the cast members, keeping the line between advertising and show-content super clear.  See some of the Youku or Tencent shows for examples.\n\nI wish we didn't have the embedded ads, but I get that the shows would probably suffer if they didn't have that revenue.  Gotta pay for those nice dinners and 4-bedroom w/private pool locations on Jeju somehow....",

It feels like it's no longer about any feelings he has for Lana but rather, 'If I can't get Lana to like and choose me, then she and anyone she likes or anyone who likes her can't happen either.' \n\nAnd I feel that, to some degree, CH is being used and egged on by SM to keep pursuing Egeon. When she finally seemed to give up tonight and said she would like to share a room with SM, her ally, SM quickly reminded CH that she still has 2 days left and to not to give up on what she wants  - despite Egeon just telling CH in front of everyone that he has no romantic feelings for her! It was such bad advice, and SM really seemed very manipulative and self-serving at that moment: throwing CH into the fray to create chaos around Lana and Egeon and weaken their feelings for each other. \n\nSM also comes across as a bit of a bully and stalker, the way he charged toward Lana and wanted to share a room with her that very night, when she had said no to him hours ago. She has said no to SM in different ways over and over again. No means no!",

Why would Lana even ask about SY, she might ask about CH because CH talked about how he was being nice to her.\n\nI did not imply that there should be a backlash, I am not surprised that there is backlash considering how the episode played out.  Yeah, there are comments that shouldn't be said but people are entitled to their opinion just like you and me.  And maybe backlash is not the correct word for it, maybe \"hate\".  Just because she is 23 does not mean anything, I am pretty sure all of the cast did their pros and cons before they sign up for the program. There are always going to be haters and mean comments and she does live-streaming for a living so I am sure she knows how to handle it. Props to her for following her feelings because the last I checked she was into Dohyun and Kang-rae, but I guess since YG seems interested in her again, she wants YG now.\n\nPS, you do realize that she still has her social media, she just made a username change which this post has not updated the change.",

This entire group has been plotting against YG and Lana and now their bond is not there anymore which I think is sad because they never got to really have deep conversations with each other without SM or Chaehee breathing down their necks.",

She was just rejected for Lana in front of everyone and and then he chooses her for a date over Lana. Wouldn\u2019t u also want to know what had just happened? She used it as a lead up and then  she switched to asking about herself, sorry if u don\u2019t understand how interactions work but it wasn\u2019t from a malicious place at all and it\u2019s annoying me that ppl keep bringing it up ..y\u2019all acting like she was calling Lana a weak hoe and saying she\u2019s bout to take her man \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude2dlikeeee\n\nSoyeon is close to both SM and CH so she was trying to help her friends get abit closer to the ones they wanted. It\u2019s funny how you see that moment as \u201ceveryone was against Lana and eegon\u201d when in that moment I see it was SOYEON helping people shes consoled. She even let seoah be with DH even tho soyeons heart had started moving towards him. How does she get power and put Lana and eegon together? She doesn\u2019t owe them anything. And its not her being against them but routing for her closest people. \n\nLana and eegon clearly have a pretty people curse. But instead of blaming everyone for not \u201cletting them be together\u201d how about blame THEM for moving so slowly and not confirming their feelings so this shit happened lol. Bc if they wanted eachother so badly they would have. \u201c they weren\u2019t able to have deep conversations without sm and ch\u201d okay even I dislike the way sm and ch move but again if Lana and eegon RLLY gave a shit atp they would of been had conversations regardless like? Lana thought she already had eegon so she wouldn\u2019t of confirmed till the end. And eegon.. \ud83e\udd74clearly he needed some reassurance (about her feelings for him and not her feelings for Soomin)and he didn\u2019t get that? Idk tho\ud83e\uddcd\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I'm glad Egeon replied clearly to her that he'd already rejected her bc she was acting like he was cheating on her or smth.\n\nSomeone else I feel bad for is Seo Ah...glad she called out Do Hyun.

So while, I understand Lana feeling blindsided and exhausted, I don't think Egeon was cowardly for choosing Soyeon. He doesn't owe Lana anything, and based on what was broadcasted, it doesn't seem like she made any effort to hang out with him these last two days. That day when they were both home, she could have approached him. But she just slept. I don't think he's trying too hard, he is considerate, but he is also exhausted",

            "comment": "Agh this episode\u2026\ud83d\ude2d everything went to hell honestly. I don\u2019t really care for the whole Seo A and Do Hyun situation, but the Lana and Egon situation is so annoying \ud83d\ude10 I really don\u2019t think Egon chose Seo yeon because he is interested in her, but rather because she is comfortable and like a good friend. He even said in the earlier episodes that he didn\u2019t see SY as a woman or whatever, but their date was still annoying. When he hugged her and the eye contact thing\u2026 ugh. But honestly I don\u2019t think he would have been so comfortable hugging her if he truly liked her?? He would have been way more nervous and shy like he was with Lana. I am 100% sure Egon asked Chae Hee for SY as his bedmate, but I haven\u2019t lost all hope for Lana and Egon. CH literally said that it seemed like Egon likes Lana a lot deep inside AND ALSO their date seemed to be way more romantic compared to this date where egon and SY were like friends, because with Lana it seemed more like he was around someone he truly liked. Also if Egon wasn\u2019t still interested why would he ask So Min why he didn\u2019t set Lana and Egon as bedmates if he didn\u2019t pair him and Lana as bedmates. ANNND at the beginning of episode 1 they showed Lana and Egon at a date which we haven\u2019t yet seen so that HAS to mean that they go on another date?? I hope so at least \ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0fBUT OMFG I WAS SOOO HAPPY when Lana said she didn\u2019t want to be bedmates with anyone \ud83d\ude24 she knows she doesn\u2019t deserve whatever the hell Egon is doing, so she chose herself which I LOVED \ud83e\udd72\n\nFor the preview for the next episode I honestly have no idea what\u2019s going to happen. Ideally Lana and Egon fix this mess, but I think it will only get bigger \ud83d\ude2d in the preview on YouTube seo yeon gave Egon a side hug and they seemed really close so\u2026 anyways.\n\nI think next weeks bedmates will be:\n\nSeo a - kang rae \nChae Hee - so min\nSeo yeon - Egon\nLana - do hyeon\n\nUPDATE: i just saw a picture on Twitter and i have no Words \ud83d\ude00. Istg if that is SY and Egon \ud83e\udee5\n\n [https://twitter.com/kuru2721bw/status/1605237967609425924?s=46&amp;t=VmL32Myp___maXPhm0UzZw](https://twitter.com/kuru2721bw/status/1605237967609425924?s=46&amp;t=VmL32Myp___maXPhm0UzZw)",

She rejected Soomin in front of everyone. Everyone was clear about her feelings. Egeon breaking the promise is just cowardly. Like he's not even competing for her, Lana has been v clear. He is a clown \ud83e\udd21 \n\n\nhaha you can check weibo's trending topics, I think it's like no. 30! basically all calling Egeon a scumbag and asking why he made a promise he can't keep",

I can understand why he did it but he hurt both SY and Lana bc he was being conscious of SM? This is a dating show, not a bromance show.\n\nBuuuuuuut if he switches to SY now i'd be ok w it lol i just don't wanna see her get taken for a ride. \n\nI really like how patient EG is being w CH. I hope she takes the hint finally.\n\nUgh CH is in power tho. They should have chosen KR! They just felt bad for her bc she cried. I would have chosen KR or SA. \n\nDid CH put DH, KR, and SA together? I wonder who she'll put with EG and Lana.",

There was no clear justification  for **not** picking Lana.  It was an ambiguous hand-wave explanation, at best.  EG made a promise, with the whole pinky-swearing ritual...Lana needs to get the needles out for EG to stick in his eye.\n\nThere have been a couple of decisions that look purely scripted in this season.  This was just the latest one.\n\n&gt; I wonder who she'll put with EG and Lana.\n\nI believe Soomin and Chaehee had an alliance in earlier episodes. I'm betting she puts Lana in with Soomin, and then Lana invokes her right of refusal with the production team, further leading to Soomin's rejection story line.",

All the clich\u00e9s to find unacceptable excuses to such toxic and irrespectful behaviours. And no mister, this has nothing to do with speed: you can be fully on board with someone and still not want the person to kiss you while you are asleep.\n\nI understand that the level is probably really low in dating show, but I find it really depressing to see comments congratuling the show for merely \"speaking about consent\", while the panel presents it as a simple awkward move from DoHyun. A man of this age who behaves like this is a walking red flag, with written all around his face: I do not care about women emotions and opinions, I only care about what I want and when I want it. I won't be surprised if someday we hear a story about him assaulting a woman or being violent with someone.\n\nApart from that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Am I paranoid to think the show is heavily scripted here? Egeon's change of heart is way too brutal and I don't believe at all his explanation of \"another's man feelings have tired me up\" - this makes no sense.\n* All the participants seemed so emotionally exhausted. I feel there is something wrong going on with this show but I am unable to explain what ...\n* I hope Lana is okay. She truly is a queen and I wish her the best.",

I haven't seen a ton of Korean variety shows but this is the first time I've seen someone so openly discuss how violated she felt by the lack of consent and that to me is some level of progress and therefore, it stood out. Two things can be true: people can admire Seoah and they can view the panel's thoughts as toxic. Also, people in a discussion forum are reacting to what was most memorable to them in that moment. While I understand your frustration about not seeing any reactions to the panel's comments, I don't think it's because commenters are taking it lightly or because they don't care about it.",

So, the amount of praise should be considered as relative to previous mentions about women's rights in variety/reality shows.\n\nYes, the initial hype-it-up response by Hong Ki was incongruous with the later message about consent, but I see it as setting up the exact observation you made: It's hard to start a discussion about social justice when the prevailing sentiment is, \"Oooooo! Did he Get Some Smoochie-Smoochie?\"",

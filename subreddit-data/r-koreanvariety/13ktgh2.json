They also took some ideas from existed game with minor changes like the drug king game, they had a board game for deathmatch too",

If you're only pronouncing this word alone, the ending consonant \u3137 \u3145 \u314c \u314a etc (there's a whole list) just all get pronounced \u3137. however, this can change depending on the following word's starting consonant.\n\nfor example:  \n'\uac83' -&gt; '\uac77' \n\n'\uac83\uc740' -&gt; \uac70\uc2a8 (you can see the \u3145 is not changed to \u3137 but instead takes the place of the \u3147 )\n\nthere are definitely more comprehensive websites which better explain these rules, although for me as a Korean language learner I find that through exposure you kind of just pick up/memorise certain patterns over time (another example: \uaf43\uc78e -&gt; \uaf30\ub2d9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;although I still can't hear a \"k\" at the end, it sounds like \"gunloh\" to me rather than log/lok. maybe just my ear isn't good at picking up those subtle sounds though, it sounds a bit like an \"ng\" rather than a hard k/g, is that another pronunciation rule when you end with \u11a8?\n\ni had to go back and listen to it again but the \u3131 in \ub7ed does get pronounced! just softer as opposed to a hard k/g.",

I didn't really think so much of it until Chloe who speaks perfect english joined in in the finale (start of e9) and said it the korean way, and then I was like.. wait so is this actually a loanword or a different word entirely. because often when bilinguals say loanwords they say it the english way. like john often drops an american accent in between korean words or says \"let's get it\"",

            "comment": "&gt;!Congrats to John, absolutely the right strongest this season for this set of games, called it ages ago.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I dislike the finale, a let down to have 2 arithmetic games back to back (and one of them being a dupe no less). I do think game 3 was made to bait 2 people into attacking each other, which was a smart move on producers' part since they'd obviously want to drag into round 4. Though if any of them had photographic memory it would not have worked.!&lt;\n\nBut the concept of this show was fun, the cast made it interesting, the set and props contributed to the luxurious/creepy atmosphere well, and I think it's a good show to start someone new to korean survival game shows with. The time as currency system was implemented well, as was the VIP suite. None of the games were as dismal as the early Genius S1 episodes' rock paper scissors deathmatch, for which I am grateful.\n\nA few iffy games however (didn't like the changes to Avalon, didn't like how physical the pins game was and to have them play it twice, didn't like that they had to bid for the right to decide order in the light switching game as it made it unfair, didn't love the auction game). I sound like I'm complaining, though I actually really enjoyed the show. I'm starting my sister off on this show, because it's an enjoyable and easy watch for someone newer to games and survival show mechanics.\nAs a Jinho fan, he was entertaining as usual. Looks like he was having fun. Living in the jungle has higher stakes I think, and he is more intense in the other show \ud83d\ude02 The JJJ trio were a ton of fun and them going against Eonkyu stirring drama was great to see. I'm glad season 2 is happening.",

Pretty anticlimactic but it can\u2019t be helped when you have one player who clearly excels in calculation compared to other two. I also don\u2019t think there is anyone who can challenge John in this game (except probably Chloe and Namhee?) Still I\u2019m pretty sure producers switch the game around to make the final more exciting. If Jinho wins Karma Nine, there is a high chance GSB rabbits game gets pushed to the final game instead. Well, I\u2019m pretty glad John take the W here in the end as he clearly dominates the game since Ep.2 onwards. Put him in the new spotlight for me because his previous variety appearance like in Running Man makes him look a bit of a dumb character lmao. !&lt;\n\nI think people seems to not like how final games include games from previous rounds but I think it\u2019s fine since in Genius finals every season also had a previously played game included into the mix too. \n\nFor the choice of the game, I agree a bit about having 2 arithmetic games back-to-back which clearly favors contestants with math skills to excel in this game more. (John could easily win the 3rd game if he didn\u2019t get a miscalculation by choosing positive number instead of negative number.)\n\nThe main problem is the game designs. \n- Playing Avalon is fine but having only 7 people instead of 8-10 players with unbalanced role isn\u2019t it. Unless the dealer gang is stupid, the cop team will lose probably 7-8 out of 10 times they played.\n- Having repetitive game again like Time is gold in the late stage of the game isn\u2019t good especially involving strangers who can help or doom your game completely. Why should my game have to be destroyed by someone else not in the game instead of myself?\n- On-off game is fine to play but having a person to completely arrange the order of guessing makes the game being too lopsided. They should also have items for players in the beginning to sabotage the light on again during the round to make the game more interesting or a sabotage to hide the result of players if it\u2019s success or failed to make later players more clueless in guessing. \n\nThere is also very little checkout games. With an opportunity to have 8 checkout games, there are only 4 of them (Ep.2,3,5,6) with 1 repeated game (GSB rabbit). So a clear target can be set on one person with no chance to redeem themselves or get revenge on some players on the opposing team. (Jiyeon/Chloe/Hyunkyu could choose 1 of JJJ alliance to give them some challenges.) \n\nAnyway, still pretty enjoyable show with clearly deserved winner who was on my radar since the 2nd episode as a dark horse but become a clear frontrunner after finishing first 4 episodes. I hope with Season 2, there would be multiple seasons and previous contestants get to join the game again. (As far as I know, Jinho/Jeseong/John should have some mileages in staying the hotel till the end so if they returned, they could use these mileages to their advantages.)\n\nThought it was over then I see Kim Jung Hyun and I go &amp;;!382\u2019&amp;$;d!\u2026not in a good way though. As a Sone, I clearly have a grudge against him. Hope he learns his lesson and sheds some new positive light. \n\nVery pleasure to have more shows like this and get to discuss with some people again after the ending of Genius. Jinho makes a comeback in this program and Bloody Game 2, having new interesting players coming into the scene. Hope Season 2 will be better with game designs because this concept have so much good potential.",

It's nice to see other fierce competitive women like Kim Namhee and Shin Jiyeon, and glad the PD cast them; fun to see Jeseong could share his comedic repertoire and went to the final with his 3-man alliance; fascinated to see John Park's new side; glad to see the man the legend 2nd placer Hong Jinho, might be a little bit rusty but still could maintain his places in games.!&lt;\n\nThe time currency might be the best part of the show. &gt;!I didn't expect John's careful spending, money-saving in the Bank and him winning games could affect his position a lot in the finals (game 3 and 4 are the proof). And vice versa, Jinho and Jeseong can only do a little with their limited time. AFAIK, The Genius' Garnet use only stops before the final. And this is why the Time is superior (in the currency context) because you have to play to win in the Time Hotel to sustain your advantages (besides the total pool prize) until the final.!&lt;",

            "comment": "Congrats to &gt;!John, it was a well deserved victory. Except for the first day, John was easily always the best player in the matches. Jinho made a valiant effort, but honestly he wasn't impressive in the show, other than dominating in that one final match game. Jeseong is objectively the worst player of the three, but he was still entertaining to watch.!&lt;\n\nTime Hotel has some good ideas compared to The Genius. I like how the player's time is used as a life bar, currency and prize money at the same time. I laughed when the players started hoarding all the water as well as Eonkyu's failure to keep track of his time. I think the Bank is a good idea, but most of the players didn't leverage it well.\n\nI also like the hotel format, it gives players a lot more opportunities to separate from others  and introduces games that require more running around. I do think they should at minimum provide water for free next time.\n\nThe biggest weakpoint is the inconsistency of the deathmatches. On paper I get the appeal, it introduces uncertainty and prevents players from intentionally losing (see Eonkyu). But I don't think it played out well, because of how the JJJ alliance dominated the show.\n\nAlso the final match was &gt;!a bit lame. Would have appreciated more variety and not so focused on arithmetic, maybe one that includes the guests like the first final game.!&lt;",

            "comment": "Okay wow, what a finale. I was pretty happy that the game design seemed pretty fair/skill-based to the end, I was worried things would get really weird and unbalanced, but &gt;!luckily it seems like the winner won because they were just so good at the games they won!&lt;.\n\nFor each of the finalists:\n\n* Jinho: &gt;!I was really happy to see him back in his element in a show like this after such a long break. I know some people will probably say Jinho just got lucky and played lamely, but I think his misfortune and fortune roughly balanced out and he proved that he still has that spark in him. It's unfortunate that he couldn't bring it home again, but he was probably the 2nd best in all of the games he didn't win, which is a testament to how reliable and varied his skillset is, he just couldn't beat John's analytical skills (if the final game was Otrio instead of the Lotto, I think there are good odds Jinho could've won). Personally I feel like Jinho's gameplay this season cemented him as one of the strongest players in these shows, with one of his biggest strengths being his social game. It's crazy how Jinho can come into a show as the clear favourite to win, almost never get targeted in the games (aside from one weirdo with odd priorities), and was consistently getting help from people with huge incentive to screw him over. Even in the first final game where he's such a favourite to win, people are so chill with him that they'll penalise his opponents despite his reputation.!&lt;\n* John: &gt;!Not much to say really, John was just a really impressive analytical player all around. He probably fumbled the social game a bit, but he was so calm and rational despite all his hurdles and that's quite an impressive trait in this game. I'd love to see him in other shows, since he seems like someone who would've been willing to make big moves under different circumstances and he's probably capable of tackling almost any type of game/format with his brain and maturity/attitude.!&lt;\n* Jeseong: &gt;!I was a little skeptical that Jeseong would be able to perform well, given how he kinda got lucky and had some big blunders at the start of the season, but I think Jeseong proved himself quite a bit with his performance towards the end, in how he seemed to really understand Time Is Gold, very niftily used his money in On And Off to protect his alliance, and his strategy in the 3rd memory game (even though his memory ended up failing him towards the end).!&lt;\n\nAll in all, very happy with this show.",

I didn't see that much of this type of gameshow, but most of what I saw feature some kind of alliance. Which is logical when it comes to game tactics, but as a viewer it kind of gets boring as instead of free for all you are watching an episode hoping enough people will team up and risk betrayal just to beat the alliance.\n\nEon kyu was able to disrupt alliance when he singled out one person when it was 4 man alliance (I think it was Hyun Kyu) and making the game 4v3 in their favor and then was able to go 2v4 in that auction game. He then gave up because he had opportunity to fight HJH. And people act like he is villain when other 4 people grouped up and he was only one competent enough to do something and not just hope that he will be lucky not to be knocked out.\n\nHe was called villain. But why? Sure he lied, but it's not like this is real life. It's only and game. And if people make quick alliances because they were grouped in rooms better and one person is someone everyone wants to team up with, then what can you do?",

I know Jeseong still wouldn\u2019t have much chance but him having bad cards clearly eliminated him from contention.\n\nAgree that 3rd game is pretty boring and once Jeseong gets 90 and other two got 0.

But likewise he might've just received a bunch of dud cards. That is called bad luck\n\nJohn Park changing 2 cards and getting 2 cards including the exact 1/6 chance card he needed in the last round is good luck. I'm not saying he wouldn't have won anyway, obviously he played sick and would've won regardless of what happened, but pretending there isn't a luck component, especially in the case of EK who clearly had a significantly repeatedly worse draw than jinho and still won nonetheless is nonsense",

All you've shown about your intellect is you actually think being able to do arithmetic with numbers below 7 is notable, and care so little about your own time that you spent 10 minutes rewinding vlc to re answer keystage 1 maths questions. I can only assume you have never achieved anything in your life if this is a source of pride for you\n\n&gt;Also, cut the bullshit of pressure and stuff.

No one said \"they had impossible numbers\" or that they are gods at the game, just that luck demonstrably changed the outcome of the game",

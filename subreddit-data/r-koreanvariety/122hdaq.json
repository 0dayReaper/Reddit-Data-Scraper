It seems the format now is basically 2D1N but less intense and much cushier. That's the vibe I get anyway. \n\nLoved the modified dodgeball. I've missed creative games. SJH had some sparks of her old self and seemed much more comfortable. While JSM proved she would have been even more hilarious than she is now if she had been in the old format of RM. She's got that unlucky charm that is fun to watch in physical games (not so much in the sports where it just feels like she's being left out and put as the referee) \n\nI will say that the staff went a long way in making the dodgeball very memorable. Myung Jae, Ju Yong, and the others were as comedic as the cast and brought out some of the old competitiveness I've missed. I hope they'll make more appearances in the future in this kind of element.",

If you listen to real interviews by the pds and members, you will know he is not that bad and rude irl.\n\nJSM picks JSJ as her best friend among RM members in her esquire interview, even saying she's the happiest when she talks with JSJ. LKS said he would like to grow old like JSJ in Tteokbokki Brothers show. SJH said she talks alot with JSJ when she has problems and issues, she also said she called JSJ among the first after she broke up with her bf. HaHa continuously said JSJ is his role model for life. In Laborhood on Hire, YJS said JSJ is his no 1 friend and will always be his friend for life. Bopil PD in his last interview said working with JSJ is the best. Hyung in PD also said in her interview that JSJ is not like how she potrayed in RM at all. Doesnt seem like a rude old guy to me. \n\nA lot more statement and example ofc but i think you get what im trying to say, I know you didnt watch these stuff that is why i bringing this up to you just to show you how people around JSJ viewed him.\n\nIt's also not fair to only bashed his character while others being rude to him is ok to you (smack his head by SJH, yelled by other members, spit by LKS, KJK getting physical with him, JSM hoping JSJ to go die early comment, being called names by way younger guys etc.)",

(The only instance of going to far to me was SeChan during the absolutely game) \n\nHe's basically the same age as her dad, and he acts like a dad to her for the most part. They also have the image of being the two weakest members, so he can only pick on her: she's maknae AND the weakest. She also gives very cute reactions and it gives the both of them more screentime which is always best. \n\nThe most hilarious rude comment of his was during their Japan trip. YJS and JSJ sent her to ask the question \"what is your favorite dish you recommend?\" From a convenience store clerk and she returned with yet another noodle answer. \ud83d\ude01 Cut to the next scene: it's them eating their 5th noodle dish in the evening. It's only been a few months since SoMin has joined. Sukjin just sighs while they're having dinner, sitting across SoMini, and says in a very serious tone: \"why didn't you ask better?\" ... Silence... \"There's nothing I like about you.\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 It just came out of nowhere.",

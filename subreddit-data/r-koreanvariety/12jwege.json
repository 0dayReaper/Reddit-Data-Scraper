kick awarded in GV territory!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~1' GV Miss: **(GV 13)** takes a sideline kick-in with a direct shot on goal that misses the near side by a few feet, would not have counted if it

the while being full court pressed by WC offense **(WC 452)** and **(WC 456)**, **(GV 13)** dekes out **(WC 456)** but her forward touch is a bit too strong and **(WC 23)** clears the ball forward into GV territory, **(GV 35)** misses the chance to trap the cleared ball and now it's a footrace between **(WC 452)** and **(GV 35)** with **(WC 456)** running down the right wing as offensive support, the cleared ball rolls to the left wing and **(WC 452)** gets to the ball first and winds up for a shot only to whiff on the kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' WC Miss: **(WC 23)** takes a

74-GK)** with **(WC 452)** pressing hard, she taps a forward pass down the sidelines for **(GV 13)** to receive, as **(GV 13)** dribbles forward down the left wing sidelines, she is chased by **(WC 452)** who manages to stop the ball but doing so, she falls on the ball and cradles the ball between her legs while she's on the ground that no one can get to without creating a dangerous situation, a free kick is award near the centerline for GV!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~4' GV Miss: **(GV 13)** takes the direct free-kick from the foul and takes a shot on target that is fully blocked by **(WC 23)**,

a flicked lob shot on target that **(WC 01-GK)** blocks but the ball goes straight up over her head, as the ball falls towards the ground **(WC 01-GK)** follows it and punches out but inbounds towards her goal mouth area, there's now a mad scramble for control of the ball, everyone is basically standing around the WC net, the ball makes it way towards **(GV 35)** who was at the top of the 16 yard box and takes a toe kick on target that is blocked by **(WC 27)** but the ball is still in play as the re-direction goes to **(GV 5)** who shoots the ball but hits the near side left post and the ball bounces out of bounds!  insane flurry of action!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' WC Miss: **(WC 119)** outmuscles **(GV 35)** on a loose ball and breaks free to take a right-footed shot that misses the

smothers!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' WC Miss: **(WC 119)** dribbles the ball from her end down the sidelines and manages to dribble all the way to GV territory with ** Coach EulYong** encouraging her

three minutes!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' WC Miss: **(WC 23)** takes the direct free-kick and lays a wing pass for **(WC 452)** but her shot is off the target by a foot to the near side low left goal

forward to the opposite right wing side to **(WC 452)** who traps the ball and maintains control and draws both **(GV 35)** and **(GV 13)** to her with a wide open **(WC 456)** waiting at the goal mouth area.  **(WC 452)** threads the needle with a quick and accurate pass to **(WC 456)** who shoots the ball to the wide right side on target and in the net **(GV 13)** barely missed the block

that his team is just deflated, he starts saying all their encouraging words are just that words, he sees their actions don't match their words, the score as-is will destroy their gold medal hopes so they need to get desparate and score goals!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' GV &amp; WC Sub: **(GV 48)** subs off for **(GV 34)** to re-enter the game, **(WC 119)** subs off for **(WC 27)** to re-enter

the ball being kicked back and forth by threading a pass forward on the left wing to **(GV 34)**, who stops and turns around and lays a cross pass to the middle lane for **(GV 5)**, but **(WC 01-GK)** comes off her goal line to attack the ball, unfortunately for her the ball didn't enter the 16 yard box as she dove in front of the ball and got her hands on it deliberately, while it was in the feet of **(GV 5)** who falls down as she steps over **(WC 01-GK)**, VAR is called, and the review is a STRAIGHT RED CARD on **(WC 01-GK)**, **(WC 119-GK)** is now WC goalie, a direct free-kick is awarded

right corner for a MAGNIFICENT SET PIECE GOAL, from last week's previews, HOLY SHIT THIS IS A BEAUTY, the WC wall didn't attack the ball and just stood in place during the whole set piece, **Coach

back inbounds, **(WC 452)** messes up the first touch and it hits her and gets to **(GV 5)** who controls the ball with her left foot and immediately kicks a cross pass to the left side with her right foot, the pass is one-time shot by **(GV 34)** with her right foot aimed to the right side middle of the net, the ball goes over a lateral moving **(WC 119-GK)**'s right hand and goes in, GV are taking advantage of power play time!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' WC TIMEOUT: **Coach EulYong** calls for a time-out, he needs to regroup his team, advising his team of positions while shorthanded, we see **(WC 35)** trying to punch at her pulled right calf and foot, **(WC 35)** states she is okay to play!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' GV Sub: **(GV 34)** subs off for **(GV 48)** to re-enter the

I don't know how they keep getting these exciting matches, but it reminds me why this is my favorite show every week.\n\nAlso, both keepers getting sent off for the same infraction is funny. If this was a scripted show, it would have been thrown out in the editing room for being a little too ridiculous haha\n\nEdit: for anyone who's interested, Euddeum released a review of SF's first match plus some other stories like first impressions with Oneweek Dieter and Eesoonal here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HWNbvLmLZc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HWNbvLmLZc). She usually subs her vids eventually too.\n\nOn a separate note, I finally realized that I'd seen clips of eesoonal before on the gunners subreddit years ago. Not if sure if there are any other Arsenal fans around, but it is always fun to have different worlds collide.",

At least the other team members had like 1 month-6 weeks of prep, but she came on the show as raw as you can get with no basic futsal training and zero conditioning. No wonder she was on oxygen after the first half, because according to them it takes 1 hour to film 10 min of footage.\n\nOne big worry is that half the team was playing while carrying an injury or had barely recovered from one. Hope SBS manages this closely, because they don't really have a good track record in my books (letting them play on a artificial pitch in streaming rain and Wendy...)\n\n(I'm a big Arsenal fan too btw, since the start of the Bergkamp &amp; Overmars era)",

We saw HaeRyeon (GAV), Eva (WC), ChaeYoung (AC) and YeoungJo (ANA) wiith injuries that required surgery. This does include all the normal injuries of this game. Now they will add FA Cup to SL and CL. Not sure if the players have time for off season to recover.\n\nI just hope that all the players will stay healthy and safe, and continue to give us great games.",

Coach JinCheol pushed them hard till they cried. It showed how serious coaches took when training their team. I would have imagine Coach EulYoung would have been much tougher to see how FC WorldClass improved.\n\nWhat interesting is the game is 20 minutes, but the shooting makes it 4 hours. Just crazy. Also kudos on all the players who commit to the show and growth, riddled with injuries. Like EuDdeum said, if they are not willing to commit, don't try to join the show. That's why we love the show. teams and players.",

I especially feel for Lee Eul Yong. He's like saying the exact same things every game and yet his players still do it wrong. I hear him telling Saori not rushing her touches multiple times. And Saori is still being Saori. I had the same reaction as both coaches when their players pointlessly kick the ball forward. Also the funny part when both teams' players not notice their mistakes and  claim they play well",

Overall skills and fitness of FC WorldClass are above all the other teams. They are the most consistent and cohesive team in the league that are not able to perform well enough. They got super excited and rushed most of the chances. I am a big fan of WorldClass and it was frustrating watching them play most of the time. You can see their abilities, but they always failed to deliver.",

Already training to try and break the 1-on-1 man marking with good off the ball movement by the whole team and pass &amp; move with the striker partnership. It's unfortunate that Saori is sometimes reverting back to old habits after last episode where she was  composed enough to take a moment to place a shot instead of blindly hitting it this episode again. But Naty is starting to be a predatory striker and as long as Saori unselfishly keep finding her partner, WC will be ok. \n\nGaevengers are in deep trouble though. I always thought that NaMi would shine once her teammates had gotten better, but now that they obviously are (and 2 are even better than she ever was), there's no improvement from her side or chemistry at all between her and her team mates. I'm afraid they have reached their plateau football-wise, but maybe that's not a bad thing as they are always a fun team to watch with loads of personalities and charisma.",

She does not have the understanding to open up her position to help her team's offense. I would have thought having a former pro soccer player as a husband would help her understand the game, but it is not. Too bad though.\n\nFC WorldClass Saori is just bursting with energy that it ended up hurting her play.  You can explode when making a movement, but once it is time to take a shot, she needs to turn off her \"jet\". All the missed shot and pass are because she rushed into it too much. It is a mental thing where she feels like she had to do everything. That is the difference between her and BoKyung (TopGirl) this past two seasons. BoKyung learned to calm herself and only play her level of football. It helps her grew into a scary striker. I hope Saori can do that for the rest of the season.",

She completely isolates herself from play, not making any runs into space and only wants the ball into her feet when it's not a great option. \n\nRegarding Saori: not trying to diss her (as I'm short too :D), but I feel like typically taller players with relatively long legs are more likely to be naturally blessed with good shot technique. MiRa from NatFam had amazing shot/volley technique, Noh YoonJu from Anaconda had wicked power with straight and curved shots and some other tall ones who looked decent with shooting only after a few training sessions. She might need to accept she lacks that same talent and just learn how to trap the ball first before shooting.",

Its understandable that she weaker in term of power in her shot, but at least she has to correctly kicked the ball. Her shooting accuracy are low because she miskicked the ball. Hopefully she can improve on that. \n\nI think NaMi might be a lost cause. After 3 seasons of playing, statistically she should have learned the placement and positioning.

However she does not know how to create one for herself. At this level when comparing to Season 1, there is no \"free meal\" for a striker. They have to make it happen by constantly moving and positioning oneself. The defensive core of every teams now, SL and CL, are very stable, balance and with minimal hole. That is why team like TG and WC are really good because they know how to stretch out the defense and creating open spaces by build-up plays. Every other teams are moving into this style now, which is why we can see NF as a bottom rung team now because of their inability to even attempt this style. Even Anaconda, before suspension had already adopted this style of play.",

WC's passing keeps getting better little by little. May the best team win the shoot out.\n\nNow next week is what I'm really ooking forward to. Eu Ddeum and YeWon are just fun to watch develop right now cuz of their athleticism and speed. The previews of Minji looking like MJ carrying NatFam also intrigues me in this match. Can't wait!",

Offensive games are great for the variety show theme and i kinda hate the defensive mindset most teams are trying to adhere to this season.\n\nDont get me wrong all the games are great but the ones with lots of scoring chances gets me out of my seat moreso than defensive games.\n\nThis game showed some improvements in the GV players\n\nI still think WC is the team to beat.  They're doing great.  Eva having an off game and Lara somewhat stagnating.  Elody showed some great moments and the Naori combo always is a threat.\n\nI sometimes wish that SeungHye can go offense more than defense.  HyeSun is a beast.",

Either win or loose, you know the team(s) try to play, instead of just defending and hoping for a lucky chance.    Looking at you, FC Bullabang.\n\nI am rooting for FC WorldClass, but unable to finished off the opponent when you had so many chances, makes me doubt them a bit. Super League is not a league where you can have off-day. You play your role well or great, no other options. Eva and Lara will the death of WorldClass. They were not able to handle a weak offensive core, imagine if a stronger team like all group A teams offensive core were playing.\n\nFC Gavengers will need to change their roles. MinGyung and NaMi will have to start to learn defensive play, and put SeungHye on the midfield/offensive team. These two have not been contributing for the last two seasons. Still no idea of positioning and movement in a match. I guess they will be playing a CL playoff game again this season.",

I think WC is a average FC but with players in their best positions. I really believe they can make it again in the top 3 teams of this season. I hope the finals be a Choi Jin Cheul former teams, I mean TG and WC.\n\nI think this season will go down to the coaches and not the players anymore.\n\nWC's Naori fine plays I believe was trained. Kathy's improvement although there was a mishap in 2nd half. \n\nGavengers strategies were great. Checking Saori with the their fastest player. Making 452(Saori) pressure their offense which depletes some of her energy at 1st half. The free kick that confused WC. I believe they were trained to those things.",

You can see them hesitating to close out chances like 1st season players. After all that experience, I would think that they will play without hesitation. Do you see FC TopGirls defense (Yubin or Rina) or FC Anacondas (HaeRi, TaeJin or Dayoung) or even FC Wonders (HeeJung or KiSum) hesitating when the balls were around them? You go get the ball or take a hit, to clear the defensive line.   \nI would love to see WorldClass and TopGirl playing for the final since they are the most complete team. But with all these season's twists and turns, we will never know. Like you said coaches' strategies to utilize they players they had play a bigger role now.",

In Kathy's case, it was also accidental and not deliberate, although, with no other woman in front of the attacker. \n\nIn my 20+ years of watching football, I've never seen a male GK get booked for handling outside the box, but I have seen quite a few defenders get booked red for fouling during a goal scoring opportunity.",

Maybe she's going through what nami went through last season and hit a wall.\n\nOmg a shoot out!!! That's cho hye lyun's specialty but will the new GK be able to handle it? Kathy is probably going to do well.\n\nOmg next game looks epic too. Every episode this season has been a drama \ud83d\ude2d super excited to watch euddeum, yeawon, and minji.",

            "comment": "Man this is the best game I\u2019ve ever seen from the show. The intensity was so high from the beginning. Saori vs. Hyesun match up is like something from an anime. Usually I root for WC, Saori is one of my favorite players but when YoungPyo took that timeout and said what he said I immediately switched sides. The coaching really makes a difference in these games. I\u2019m not saying one is better than the other, it\u2019s a difference in style but I personally dislike EulYoung\u2019s hardass attitude. To me, your players to finish at every opportunity is impossible so it\u2019s better to focus on what you can do moving forward. I understand he is aggravated a lot because he expects a lot out of them. Which can also be a good thing for them since this means he prob trains them hard. And they have improved a lot. Just personally I do not like his coaching.  \n\n&gt;! The red cards in the game really added some extra spice to the pace. I think in the future they should probably shorten to 2 mins instead of 3.!&lt; Hyesung to me, the MVP for this game is all I need to say. SeungHye\u2019s kicks have gotten better and were on point the whole game, I think having YoungPyo as a coach has unlocked her potential as a good mid. EunHyung has shown great improvement again &gt;!her goal celebration was hilarious!&lt; MinKyung did well for someone playing injured. NaMi didn\u2019t really show up, until &gt;! That last minute pass she made to tie the game. That was a perfect play from her, she deserves praise for that!&lt;\n\nSaori did well this game, she\u2019s still messing up on her touches but even pros do that. I think it\u2019s because sometimes she\u2019s too fast for the ball. The scene where she dribbles against HyeSung in slowmo was epic \ud83d\ude05 Naty did well too, her kickins have gotten better, she needs to be better at finishing off a run on her own. Elody has improved again, she really impressed me with that one in field pass, I want her to do more. Eva kept messing up with the passes in the beginning. Lara is the biggest problem on their team. Being flexible and light is not ideal for a defender. &gt;! GV scored when she was guarding the taller EunHyung or bigger MinKyung for their 1st &amp; 2nd goal. You can see after they scored EulYoung switched her out. Which he should have done anyways for those kickin\u2019s. Specially since HyeSung was kicking so well this game. !&lt;\n\nMy prediction is that &gt;!WC will win because of the difference in goalie!&lt; I can\u2019t wait for SF game next week, since their last game I want to see how much more they\u2019ve improved this time. Off the preview it seems EuDdeum will go off. Also, I\u2019m a big fan of Yewon, she looks like a pure striker. It would be amazing if those two developed some tikitaka. The fact mostly showed SF makes me nervous though, like NF might have been better. Keeping the really good bits with editing.",

            "comment": "Firstly, super excited for next week game, FC Streaming and Fc Gukdae. Looking forward to seeing the progresses of all these new players. Go go FC Streaming!\n\nI was an exciting and messy match. Another match that was so unpredictable and frustrating at the same time. Two red cards for the same infractions, that one was wasted and the other one taken advantage off. Lots of own goals. I think it is a \"luck\" game.\n\nI am a big fan of FC WorldClass, but this match made me question their abilities to win this season. They were as dominating as they were also frustrating. Eva played a lousy game and made me wonder why was she so bad when she is one of the OG of the show. They kept telling her to focus which I kinda agreed with. But after so many games, shouldn't she came into the game prepared? It might be because of her knee injury but still, making stupid mistakes every game was really infuriating. Naori duo may be the most skilled and fastest attacking front in the league, but their inabilities to convert those chances to goal may help other team changes their defensive tactics. Saori's ball trapping is still subpar and Naty lack of strength/power made me question their chances of playing in the final. I think overall weakness of FC WorldClass is their power/strength. Weak (power) defense in Eva and especially Lara, is something that the other team should take advantage of. Their inability to take advantage of the red card is so glaring that I am doubting their chances. Like I mentioned on previous game, they always won their first game and lost the next one. It is a curse. They were lucky because of own goals and \"still\" unstable goalkeeper.\n\nI know that we still have to wait for the result next week, but they are not playing to the level that I expect them to, with the skills and teamwork that they have. I am hoping that I am wrong.\n\nWell, FC Gavengers is FC Gavengers. Nothing much to show but their grits and determinations. Losing HarRyeon as a goalkeeper didn't help, of course.\n\nI think change of coaches might be welcoming for both teams.\n\nAt least, I am excited for Challenge League match between FC Streaming and FC Gukdae next week!",

            "comment": "* Frustrating match, as seemingly all of them are when Gaevengers play. Their most powerful weapon is most definitely that they disrupt at all times. With Hye Sun being 80% of that disruption. It got WILD after Natty was dismissed. Sad that WC didn't realize they can leave the wall once the ball has been touched. \n* World Class is good and has a lot of potential but they really need to iron some stuff out. First off Eva had a bad game. 80% of the time she touched the ball, especially in the first half, she was turning it over by kicking it out of bounds. Then there's Elodie who kicks so often with her toes which means if it's even close to the goal it's just luck. Same can apply to Saori too, who I noticed kicking with her toes a few times when she needed to be more precise by using instep kicks. Saori has clearly upgraded but she is still rushing when she gets near the goal and that's leading to World Class having finishing issues. Once she and Naty put that together they will be quite dangerous. \n* If Eva had been on her A game and I was the WC coach, I would have been tempted to shift to a 3-0-1 or 2-1-1 with the center fielder (Lara) playing more offense then defense and left Eva (or Elodie) on an island on defense. I'm not particularly scared of Gaevengers offense, Natty is a good goalie and Saori + Naty + Lara on offense could result in some real damage on offense. But with Eva off her game, no way I'm doing that unless I'm comfortable with Elodie as the sole defender. \n* It's a shame the game got all weird with a lot of own goals, goalies red carded and playing with one man down. That's soccer/futsal so it is how it is but Gaevengers was playing quite well after the first few minutes of being on the ropes and that's with injured players, a new goalie and a sick player. \n* Gaevengers is NOT the team you want to be a man down playing against. They are overwhelming and smothering when it's 4 to 4. When you're down one that dam breaks and they become a tsunami. \n* It's nice to see the sky balls on corner-kicks are back. That used to be a popular thing with decent results for the teams with a tall player and then it disappeared for a long time. \n* Continue to not be a fan of WC coach. But who knows, maybe some like that type of coaching. \n* Love the decision to end there. Hate when it's obvious due to the time that is left. If you noticed the time left or have a feeling for how long the episode has been, you'd think a team scores last second and wins, but it's a tie so there's a shoot-out. \n* I'm so excited for next weeks match. I'm loving StreamingFighter. Still bummed about Seohyun at goalie for NatFam though. Such a waste. But Min ji is so exciting to watch. What is she like after a month more of training??",

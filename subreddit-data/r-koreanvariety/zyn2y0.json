It's just unfortunately how the streaming services world works now as everyone's trying to start their own service and content.\n\nIMO, it's worth it to support Viki since the volunteers do a really good job especially if you want a bit more nuance with the dialogue and so on. Usually the deals (for the monthly/yearly plan, etc.) are ya around Thankgiving/Black Friday or this past November and holidays season. Sometimes IIRC there's also discounts during January/February or Chinese New Year, and a few other holidays.\n\nViki has a bit more other content with Chinese dramas and so on, they have an extensive catalog sometimes. Too bad there's barely any Japanese shows and subbers these days as everyone's doing Kdramas and so on.\n\nDon't forget VPNs to access certain content. You'll probably need a VPN set to (Southeast) Asia with these Asian streaming services, check this for a bit more info: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zobw4m/where_can_i_watch_variety_shows_here_in_spain/j0m09qv/",

Those who end up with each other really do date. And in fact 5~6 couples have tied the knot in the last 18 months since the show started.\n\nSo it's fun for Koreans to watch because we are all somewhat familiar with their jobs, we know the cities they are from, the people are middle aged, act just like your next door neighbor(so we can emphasize), and it's a fun mystery figuring out who ends up with who, and there is an actual chance that they'll marry.\n\nSo it's as real as it gets.\n\nBut this doesn't work that well for foreigners. They know almost none of the private or public companies the contestants work for, some of the job titles are very unfamiliar to them, and since everything is translated anyway, you don't feel like the contestants are your next door neighbor.\n\nAlso, and perhaps this is the biggest thing, the people are middle aged and aren't really that attractive compared to say Heart Signal or Singles Inferno. Visuals matter in shows like this, especially if you're watching it in another language.",

            "comment": "I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO people seem to just post in /r/IamSolo instead of here in /r/koreanvariety, don't really know why.\n\nAnyway, as a visuals connoisseur/superfan/et cetera (lol wtf?), I Am Solo just doesn't have good visuals at all most of the time.\n\nLike seriously sometimes the visuals are so lacking, it's just not gonna catch other people's attention despite the personalities and so on.\n\nFor example, sometimes the male housemates for I Am Solo are paired with less attractive girls for their particular season. And then for a different season, it'd be the female housemates that would be paired with less attractive boys. Like it's often lopsided and not balanced, the producers/casting people really do some of the housemates dirty with the opposite sex.\n\n**See Season 7's legendary girl named Ok Soon**, like people have expectations with her name now. But these past few seasons they probably purposely miscast the name to remove the fame.\n\nSeason 7 starts at Episode 39, ends with Episode 44. Each season of I Am Solo is say 6-8 episodes and they can be watched standalone, no need to watch the previous seasons.\n\nPersonally I'm a slice of life and so on superfan too and so I don't mind the disappointing visuals. But ya a lot of people want to like have a vicarious and so on experience with the dating show members sometimes and so if they are of younger age then they can't really relate as much with the cast of I Am Solo. \n\nAs with I Am Solo the housemates are usually in their late 20s or say 40s already. Remember a lot of the target demographics for romance/etc. shows are probably teenagers or people (more so young adult females) in their 20s. Like the target audience needs something to initially get them hooked and good visuals/etc. is often the easiest way to do that as it's kinda inherent to general human behavior, see the celebrity and such worship.\n\nThere's also ya the cultural factors in play. For example, some people will probably not immediately notice that there's often a bunch of people from Busan or other cities/provinces outside of Seoul, and so like the long distance relationships are guaranteed to be present. And so it's harder for the rest of the cast to pair up due to the distance.\n\nPlus ya, some of the jobs are not as interesting (despite having way more variety compared to other dating shows, like wtf they have shamans for I Am Solo, lmao) or like they are clearly more like regular people and so their personalities are not as amenable for TV/drama/etc. purposes.\n\nThere's different factors or elements to consider, sometimes it's just due to luck or like lack of exposure for one reason or another. Like somebody should really host discussion threads here in /r/koreanvariety but ya idk, it's just in /r/IamSolo right now.\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and more info on where to watch them**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zqf0dp/singles_inferno_2_ep_3_4_20221220/j147u12/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/ &lt;--- check this link for where to watch other dating shows.\n\nCheck this link for somewhat updated and consolidated thread links: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zx36d6/who_are_the_legendary_or_iconic_cast_members_of/j2094j5/",

            "comment": "If you want to know more about how dating shows are made, there are now meta/behind the scenes shows about it.\n\nThere's **UnREAL with Rachel or Shiri Appleby** for western/Anglo/American/etc. dating shows or shows like The Bachelor.\n\n**Love is for Suckers** (has Lee Da-hee, one of the panelists of Single's Inferno (2), as the producer or main character there) is a more modern Korean drama version, it just finished almost exactly a month ago now. It'll show you how Korean/East Asian dating shows are created.\n\nKingdom of Love 2 (the dating reality show inside Love is for Suckers) is mainly based around probably I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO (/r/IamSolo) and so on, like if you watch I Am Solo you'll see familiar stuff, references, et cetera.\n\n**If you want to skip the drama and go straight behind the curtain for how dating shows are made, start at Episode 5/6 of Love is for Suckers as that's when they actually begin the Kingdom of Love 2 dating show, lol.**\n\n---\n\nOh and dating shows are sometimes not that staged/scripted/et cetera, check this thread for more info: https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/zudlyq/scripted_or_not/j1j0u8f/. Basically they just create situations that are bound to be interesting.\n\nSo sometimes some shows get boring and so people won't like if it's a constant thing. Like with I Am Solo, the production and panelists and even the housemates themselves often emphasize the lack of say activities or plans for the show. As in, it's a good thing that they have a lot of free time (they oftentimes still get no sleep as the filming time repeatedly goes over midnight and so it's not matching some people's circadian rhythm/etc.) when it comes to I Am Solo but sometimes it's detrimental as the housemates don't know what to do as even if they watched the show before, it's still new when they're actually participating in it. Like the behind the scenes, etc.\n\nFor example, in Single's Inferno 2, at the end of Episode 6, say around 1h 18 minutes in, they told the new male housemate to wake up and have a certain posture (presumably for camera visibility/etc. purposes). And so some shows are more strict about things like that. \n\nWith I Am Solo they will reprimand the housemates on camera (as in it's not removed in the edits or final product) if they diverge from their confessionals (talking to the producers/camera/etc.) right before certain choices or decision times. Say for example when it's time to choose a certain person for their 1-on-1 date, et cetera. But the production staff still often let the last minute changes slide, lol. So ya, they have a bit more free reign sometimes.\n\n---\n\nRecently with **EXchange/Transit Love 2 (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc5602)**, a lot of people got bored of the constant Hae Eun crying scenes and other stuff before the next set of new housemates came in and changed everything.\n\nSo a lot of people forgot that lull before the latest housemates.\n\nSame with **Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774)**, some people got sick of a particular love triangle and so on. But even before that situation developed, like I can agree and see why people would call Pink Lie a slow burn.\n\nWith **Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac)**, the best visuals out of any Korean/Chinese/Japanese/etc. dating shows, it seems that ya some people are getting bored as they're not going on 1-on-1 dates and so it feels like just a vacation or tourist advertisement for Bali, lmao. Like they're often doing group activities and so yup, people want more individual time and all that.\n\n---\n\nIt's really up to the producers/writers/editors/etc. how they want to pace and set up the show. Since editing time is often a few months after filming to comb through all the footage, they can pick and choose when to go slow/fast or which particular love lines should be prioritized or made like the focal point.\n\nFor sure try watching Love is for Suckers for the dramatized behind the scenes of these East Asian dating shows, Lee Da-hee and Choi Si-won can be so funny, lmao. But if you want a more western and realistic but also outlandish take, UnREAL (/r/UnREALtv) with Rachel or Shiri Appleby is so damn good.\n\nBut ya it also really depends on the often random audience reception. Like this 2nd half of 2022 was crazy with the new dating shows too, so a lot of people are probably fatigued by now with the deluge of Korean (and Chinese) dating shows.\n\nWe'll see how **Heart Signal 4** goes (the **Chinese version just finished its 5th season** too), and if it will recapture both the domestic Korean and international (Southeast Asia and Americas, and so on) popularity on the streaming services.\n\nLike if Viki and VIU don't both pick up Heart Signal 4 in 2023, pretty sure there's gonna be some people that will be so sad to miss out if they don't know of other avenues to access the show. \n\nImagine if Netflix gets the license for Heart Signal 4 instead. Like damn, imagine Heart Signal 4 threads reaching 1000 comments, like they do with Single's Inferno, lol. It'd be so lively in here, /r/koreanvariety. Ah, I miss it when /r/terracehouse was more active, it was also a hub for all these East Asian dating shows. Time passes.",

Some seasons of the same show are better than others.\n\nHeart signal is the most neutral one. Most other shows are like spinoffs of heart signal. \n\nThey are getting to the point where 1-2 shows are released every month so there are some shows with more ridiculous concepts now.\n\nStart with heart signal and then if you want to try other ones with more of a gimmick or theme, you can move on to love catcher, somebody, transit love, or single's inferno. \n\nHeart signal is probably the closest to TH in vibe but the format is still different. More focussed on dating and people don't move in and move out whenever they want. They all live together for a month.\n\nI am Solo is more abt \"real\" people (non-influencers) who are looking for marriage. Totally different format (only a few days long) but there have been at least 4 marriages and a baby that have come out of that show.\n\nTransit love is about exes that either want to rekindle or date new people. Season 2 was legendary. But this show is a lot more sad bc people come with baggage and expectations, rather than just starting fresh.\n\nI hope you find something you like!

As like the housemates and the panelists themselves will often randomly segue into a scene with like the flavored drink, laundry detergent, app/software, et cetera, lol.\n\nThere's also a bunch of new Japanese dating shows, check /r/terracehouse, here's the new Koi No Last Vacation (Love\u2019s Last Vacation): https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zxwiih/if_youre_missing_terrace_house_try_koi_no_last/\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zx36d6/who_are_the_legendary_or_iconic_cast_members_of/j2094j5/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zqf0dp/singles_inferno_2_ep_3_4_20221220/j147u12/**\n\n**Check these older threads (from 2021/etc.) for maybe more info on these slice of life (and dating) shows**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/n5ilf1/is_terrace_house_coming_back/gx2f6mr/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/qlmg00/are_there_any_shows_similar_to_terrace_house/hj68yh7/?context=10000\n\nThis thread has the different names of streaming/OTT services (like TVING, Coupang Play, wavve, etc.) or websites and the various Youtube channels and links for where to watch some of these dating shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yktjg9/can_anyone_suggest_some_kdating_shows/iuvbg43/\n\nCheck here for where to watch other dating shows with VPN/et cetera: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zywb4f/transit_love_2_post_show_content/j28kqn3/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/\n\nMore info on where to watch the East Asian dating shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zlml4b/ramyun_chill_episode_5_finale_221214/j06e2lh/\n\n**Check MyDramaList too for a more visual list of these dating shows**. Some people have their lists with only Korean shows, others Chinese, some combined, et cetera.\n\n---\n\n**Shanghai Sharelife (/r/Shanghaisharelife) is the Chinese version of Terrace House (/r/terracehouse)**, it's really good, some of us put it above Terrace House itself. Try to watch it if you haven't already.\n\nLike some people's list is probably like this Shanghai Sharelife preferred over Terrace House, which is favored over Heart Signal, and now the EXchange/Transit Love series, with possibly Pink Lie and Love Catcher in Bali in tow.\n\nPart of it is because of the panelists, they were more laidback and chill, especially for Chinese (dating) shows standards. It had some known people in it, this is the panelist list: Chen Jianbin, Li Dan, Wei Daxun, G.E.M. or Gloria Tang Sze-\u200bWing, Yang Li, Zeng Keni or Jenny Zeng.\n\nIts panelists (more context (essentially has no spoilers though) on Shanghai Sharelife panelists: https://www.reddit.com/r/Shanghaisharelife/comments/o4ljmq/unpopular_opinion/h2iu3q7/) are considered the top of these dating shows and they can/will influence how you perceive the housemates' personalities, actions, et cetera.\n\nHere's the whole playlist for Shanghai Sharelife, with/without panelists, and with also the panelists' real time reactions: https://www.reddit.com/r/Shanghaisharelife/comments/kumgil/my_thoughts_on_the_first_3_eps_of_the_show/gjw4kuo/\n\nThis is the actual start for Shanghai Sharelife, click the Amara (for English subs by ShibaSubs) links: https://www.reddit.com/r/Shanghaisharelife/comments/lyvgdg/episode_1_english_subs/\n\n**If you haven't watched the original first season of Terrace House, this is kinda how to watch Terrace House: Boys x Girls Next Door: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zfkwnq/how_do_i_watch_boys_girls_next_door/izchnov/**\n\n---\n\nSo maybe start with **Heart Signal (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110)** 1, 2, or 3. Or just 2 if you want as that's considered the best by a lot of fans. There's also the Heart Signal spinoff called Friends, but you'll want to watch Season 2 and 3 first to have a bit more context on the returning housemates.\n\n**The Chinese version of Heart Signal just finished its 5th season**. It's available on the WeTV/Tencent Video website (has English subs), and also their WeTV/Tencent Video channels on Youtube for free but without proper English subs.\n\nThere's also the Japanese version of Heart Signal but nobody picked that up. Heart Signal Season 4 for the original Korean version should be out sometime this 2023.\n\nThen there's **EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560)** that a lot of people like due to the long episodes (some are 2 hours or so long, way different than Terrace House's usual 40 minutes or so). And like it gets really emotional, see the threads above for more description of it.\n\nThough IMO watch **Love Catcher 2** and **Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac)** as soon as you can. The third season of Love Catcher is called Love Catcher in Seoul (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \uc11c\uc6b8) and then the fourth season is Love Catcher in Bali.\n\nLove Catcher 2 for the legendary execution of the added mind game element to the dating shows. And then Love Catcher in Bali for just unbeatable visuals, like no other Korean/Chinese/Japanese/etc. dating show comes close.\n\nThere's also the **Chinese version of Love Catcher, The Secret X (\u673a\u667a\u7684\u604b\u7231)**, Episode 1 from iQIYI Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTj-dJkp8o\n\nDon't worry about the dating shows having different seasons as they're pretty self-contained or can be watched as standalone. Though ya better to watch chronologically or in order as sometimes the panelists/etc. will spoil you the previous pairings and like events from the preceding seasons, see here for a bit more info (same as an earlier thread link above): https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zywb4f/transit_love_2_post_show_content/j28kqn3/\n\n**Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774)** is also really good due to like the secret shame concept. But some people didn't like how it was initially slow in the beginning and so on. Still worth a watch and rewatch, IMO, as you try to find existing or non-existent initial hints about the cast's secrets after you've finished the show.\n\nSecret Man and Woman (\ube44\ubc00\ub0a8\ub140) is more low budget version of Pink Lie but some people actually prefer it or enjoyed it more, as it's got different secrets and situations and so on.\n\nREA(L)OVE is like the predecessor to Pink Lie and Secret Man and Woman. Long story short, REA(L)OVE can get dark and real offensive due to the hosts/panelists but they're clearly trolling, so just watch until the end if you want to see the secret shame and so on concept at its current peak (with the secret/shame/etc. concept, nothing has really topped REA(L)OVE since its Netflix release in 2018).\n\n---\n\nTL;DR: **Heart Signal**, **EXchange/Transit Love**, **Love Catcher 2** and **Love Catcher in Bali**, **Pink Lie**, et cetera.",

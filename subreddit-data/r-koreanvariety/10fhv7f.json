            "comment": "It was a good safe game that highlighted both team weakness. FC WorldClass ability to not finish their opponent and FC Actionista as an incomplete team. The rain did play a major role on how this game was played.\nI am not expecting too much from Actionista since we all knew about their limits, but very disappointed with WC. Since I am a big fan of them from beginning, their inability to score when they were actually controlling the game was very frustrating. Saori might be a top scorer but an effective striker,, she is not. Lara was just a hole in their defense. I think they need to go Challenge League to toughen up and gained more experience playing. If they do not improve for next season, they will languish in the same spot as a 3rd or 4th ranking team again. \nActionista will need Yeo Jin back for next season to be a scary team that they were last season. At least their goalkeeper proved that see can be a really good one next season. Her good judgement and fearlessness was shown in this game.\nHow about the new team debuting? Looks like a sacrificial lamb, even when they hyped up each of the new players background.I think their new coach looks like Choi Jin Chul (FC TopGirl and FC World Class coach)",

            "comment": "I support a local club and this game reminds me of the painfull memories due to their historical struggle to  get a decent CF who can finish chances or link up with a brilliant nr 10 or winger. \n\nSaori is a great forward, but not a great finisher and at least need a second player to pass to in the final third. That's why it was pretty infuriating to see her strike partner up front (can't remember her name)  often doesn't keep up with the forward runs to offer the pass option. I guess the coach was annoyed by it too, the support runs were much better after Natty came in. \n\nOn the other hand you have He In who's finally become a brilliant creator of chances and can now lay it on a platter even for her less skilled team mates and they still have trouble scoring the biggest chances... It's scary to think what will become of Actionista's if HeIn leaves the team at some point. She's the benchmark of the show on starting from 0, training and becoming a very good allrounder. I hope others will follow her lead, and from the preview I think &gt;!that former rugby player seems to have gone up a few levels! She looks like another person since the previous match, so much composure and control in her dribbling, wow!!&lt;",

                    "comment": "That is so true. Saori is too fast for any supporting striker which is why she have to score when there were chances. I think her lack of game experience might contribute to that, She will need to think quickly when she has the ball and playing in more game i think will help with that. Her techniques are there but it looked like sometimes she trying to strike \"beautifully\". Whereas Naty have the playing skills but not the fitness and strength of a striker like Saori.\n\nIf HaeIn left, just announced Actionista dead. She is FC Actionista. A full complete player that I hope will get a better supporting players. YeJins departure really hurt the team this season. Everybody else need to step up to make them a contender again.\n\nThen again, keeping a team intact is really difficult for this show/league.",

It is lack of experience yes, because in the earlier games she was always up top alone with no one to pass to. I think it might be even worth it long term to move Eva up to develop a partnership  and get someone else to play defense. You at least have Kathy to save some of the potential rookie mistakes.\n\nKeeping teams intact is my biggest worry now, because we're at the point that for some players the 'journey' might be over/completed as far as it's in their powers. So they might be thinking of moving on.  I'm especially concerned for HeIn, HyunYi and PSY.",

            "comment": "So I'm still upset about FC Anaconda's suspension, and will continue to be until we get clarity that it isn't how it seems or until they return. They are gone from my fav TV show, they are highly likely not developing their skills anymore or at doing so at a snails pace, which sucks. IF they all come back, which I have serious doubts about, they will have already been the worst team in the league (suspended) and will have developed individually and as a team very little. All while all the other teams have been in the leagues, playing and practicing. So they'll be further behind and almost guaranteed to lose again. Lame and it doesn't make sense. \n\nHowever, I freaking love the new team, lol. First off, really smart on behalf of production to put together a YouTube content creator team. That gets all of their combined subscribers at least hearing about the show and a portion of them watching to support them or watching out of curiosity. I also really like the mixture of people; a fitness junkie, an athletic young woman, a military spec ops vet, an amateur soccer expert off the field, the overweight humorous one who does fitness related stuff it seems and one more mystery member. They should be highly entertaining, sure, but they almost all seem fit and they are all young. If enough of them show promise right off the bat then they could quickly catch up to the play of some of the teams in the Challenge League.",

Obviously passion has always been part of their appeal (and of the show in general), but they wear their hearts on their sleeves a little too much compared to most other teams. Looks like they're finally getting good at bouncing back from their emotions and getting it together.\n\nAnd Jung Hyein, calmness itself. I'm in awe every damn time and grateful that she's been able to make it work and stay on the show this whole time. Hope she can still be on next season.\n\nAs for next week's episode, I absolutely can not wait! It's gonna a bloodbath between my two favorite teams.

            "comment": "Man, Saori has really upgraded her game. She was by far the best player on the field, both offensively and defensively. She was all over the place, going full speed but still maintaining a relatively light touch when dribbling the ball and passing it to teammates. Bravo to her for developing her skills and becoming more than just a speedster. It really seems like World Class needs Naty to hurry up and develop as an offensive weapon in order for their team to take the next step. By the start of next season she needs to have better ball skills, understanding of the game and confidence taking shots on the goal and working with Saori. They also need Lara to step up her game like Yubin (Top Girl) did as a defender. \n\nA close second behind Saori is obviously He-In. My goodness, if she was just a few inches over with so many of her great shots she'd have like 3-4 goals in this game. Honestly, all she really needs to take her game to the next level it seems is to increase her playing speed. She's got solid ball skills and such but with how slowly she implements them and tries to make everything perfect, defenders are able to catch up to her and to knock the ball out of her possession. If she speeds up but maintains possession she will be really dangerous. \n\nElodie, just like with many others in the past, need to stop with the jumping header on kick-ins. Skips off their head, changes the trajectory and the goalie is out of position to block the ball. Easier said than done but it is what it is. I'm glad the producers show the players later crying, sorry or saying \"it happens\". I feel like it throws a bucket of water on most viewers who would run to SNS to comment a critique or something mean at the player. \n\nIt continues to suck balls, not that there's anything production can really do about it, that the time remaining in an episode makes clear who wins and loses &gt;95% of the time. If a team has a lead with a certain amount of time left or if it's tied with a certain amount of time left, it's clear there's no shootout and that the one with the lead will win and the tie will be broken before regulation time is over. This game, 2-1 Actionista, with less time left than they allow to show a shootout means Actionista won. \n\nAs for how the game played out, World Class lost concentration, their defense started to allow a bunch of shots on the goal (hitting the post) and Saori as 85% of the teams offense was only able to convert one of World Class's chances into a goal. \n\nFinal match: I predict Top Girl wins. I like seeing jinkyung and EXY (WJSN) in the stands. Though Jinkyung, SBS... what is going on? She was \"leaving to go study abroad\" and now she's in the stands for multiple games and at the Olympics in Qatar running into the cast... make it work and sign her up again to join FC Giants. Oh, and nice to see Hyunyi's husband and kid(s).",

They would prolly score more for more convincing win. Even tho it's *fat shot* or weak shot from &gt;!Moon Ji In and Choi Yoon Yeong !&lt;at least you can assure they're on right moment for pass play or broken plays to shoot like &gt;!Song He Na vs Actionista!&lt;. &gt;!Moon Ji In!&lt; can handle a ball but a abysmal finishing however ***i'm trusting the process*** because her &gt;!teammate Jeong Hye In and former Actionista Cap Choi Yeo Jin!&lt; were totally begineers unlike her that she used to play it *^(\\[for some people who didn't know, she audition for S1 but didn't got picked up\\])* but continuing progressing to became on what they are now - and im hoping she can unlock herself like Kim Ga Young of WW. For defense,&gt;! Lee Young Jin!&lt; did her great job at CB and marking down &gt;!Saori!&lt; in Transition.\n\nFor &gt;!World Class!&lt;, the defense at FB/CB is always their achilles heel + they're distracted too at defense which got &gt;!Coach Lee Eul Yong and Elody pointing out on Soari. !&lt;Yet kinda awkward because **she's always the one** who open up the broken plays and creating opportunities to score which brought them success in dramatic fashion at Group Stage to KO rounds.\n\nBest Player of the Game is &gt;!Jeong Hye In!&lt; \\- say no more because i said against&gt;! World Class (at GS) !&lt;she's vastly improved. At &gt;!Semis vs Giants!&lt; she became matured. And i mentioned that &gt;!Actionista!&lt; is \\[***vivid\\]*** in this match just because **it's not a 2 women team** courtesy of&gt;! Jeong Hye In and Lee Hye Jeong!&lt; on this one but ---&gt;&gt;!(Lee Young Jin did her part on defense and Moon Ji In and Choi Yoon Yeong came up big from bench to dent their opposition)!&lt; , however their ***\\[vividness is focal\\]*** from &gt;!Jeong Hye In!&lt; in terms of **pressing and presence.** She can break through defense and set a pass play to open teammates + not only she can shoot from midfield ***as always,*** her shooting angle + shot selection became refined whether it's shooting low or high - she's a threat.",

Some of her teammates had enough size to match up with Actionista's but play too soft and lack athleticism to keep up with Saori's speed.

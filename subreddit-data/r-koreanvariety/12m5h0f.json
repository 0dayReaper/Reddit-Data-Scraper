He will be replaced by young trot singer Lee Chan Won.\nThere is no eng sub for episode (and I don't think it would be at this point), but from my understanding he simply said that he need a rest. He still officially in Knowing bros cast through.\nBuzz's drummer Kim Yejun said earlier this year that they are planning tour in 2023 (it's 20th group's anniversary) and there is high possiblity of new album, so my best guess that Kyung Hoon is giving the most amount of energy for this. (Even like I slightly worried that in 2019 he manage to do well than they also had tour+album+he was on two shows already). Hope he will stay fit and healthy this year.\n\nP.S. Problem child in house has pretty stable rating (3-4%). It seems like they are trying to move to older audience. Cast, questions, guests - all of this in period 180-200 ep pointed to the shift. Absence of english subs from ep 200 and later on also doesn't help. It's a shame really, show had a good momentum, and even with such simple concept it was calm, relax and comfortable program, still is for some extent. But it's hard to enjoy it, especially than 30 min of episode spent on guest's introduction and the cast kind of lost philosophy of united problem solving.",

Although everyone jokes about his \"head voice\" on variety shows, he's an incredible singer and it's a joy to see him on stage with his bandmates.",

Which is shame, whole album worth a full scale concert.\n\n[interview with Kim Yejun](https://youtu.be/-xkdI6UrXI0)\nNo eng sub, but yeah, they are \"planning stuff\"",

But now with KJK and especially with the addition of LCW on the show, I really want to watch this show. It's really a pity that VIU wasn't able to renew their licensing with KBS. And KBS World also don't bother to air this show with sub anymore. Because other types of variety show it's still possible to watch it with simple understanding of Korean. But since this is a quiz show, it's pretty boring to watch it without sub given the fact that I don't even get what they are trying to answer. I guess it's really time for me to start learning Korean to watch these shows.",

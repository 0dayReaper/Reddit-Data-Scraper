    "postText": "The cast at recent episode discussed the reason why the rating of the show dropped(ep 327 at 10.6%).\n\nThey discussed if the show are too dependent on 3 most frequent appearing cast:\n\n1. Kim Jun Ho\n2. Lee Sang Min\n3. Tak Jae Hoon\n\nCalling them the Slave/Nobi(lowest class during Korean dynasty)\n\n- Based on Kim Jun Ho, Apparently it's bad to appear multiple times on same episode because they get paid by episode (not by number of slot). So if they appear consecutive slot on same episode it's bad for the cast because the slot are different recording session.\n\n\nLink: https://youtu.be/BWyyDMUG87w",

Why they can't brought out any new topic? Or do the writer staff can think any new topic? \n\nThe things is they chemistry is pretty good so I'm gonna enjoy whatever they talk about, but the topic of president and the hierarchy is too old fr. \n\nOther things is the fake organization is not really appealing to me as viewer since, well, the organization itself is fake so I find the situation where they argue, impeachment, or challenge about the organization itself is weird and like \"why the fuck they keep going on with these situation just for fake glory and title?\". It's more entertaining and make sense for me if they are argue and fighting for something tangible like Korean Beef or bottle of liquor that worth of $500 since, well, since it's more make sense for people to fight for tangible real things than intangible fake non functional things.",

I personally think they are funnier when they are in groups of two rather than trios and squads. \n\nAlso, the dumb trio is really not working, it's not that funny because they don't do activities that emphasize being dumb. It would be funnier if you had the dumb trio take tests/ do educational activities.",

Watching the same people isn't fun anymore. \n\nI don't like men over 40 behaving like a 20 year old. Frankly, as an adult, sharing the same age, makes me have a slight embarresed feeling when I see them act like that. I think Jordan Peterson has phrased it very well. This is a global phenomena and a cultural backward trend. \n\nI would like to see men behave like thier age if they are to be bachelors at my age.  Do they have a sense of duty, what are thier values and how do they contribute to adding significant changes to the society? Some of them seem to be great philantropists- would be great to show such content and add depth. Instead we see them act childish, drink and have a broculture. Any adult 40+ would be seen as a failure with that imbalanced content. \n\nAs long as the show keeps trying to oneup content with bratty behavior without thier own mom present in the show - I'll watch something else. \n\nNow, that's offcourse not all. When I was very young and started to party at the legal age of 19 and continued to 20, I only had bad experience by such type of men. They had nothing in clubs to do imho. These men resembles so much of those type of bad men in that show. The whole partying (drinking alcohol) and getting up late with a bad hangover. Not eating proper home-cooked food. Having an un-homely apartment. \n\nNo. Just no. I don't understand why they wanted to derail from the original concept.",

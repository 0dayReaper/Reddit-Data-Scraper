They just had \"Quiz\" and chose the loser for penalty and that's it.\n\nI thought that they might watch sunrise together or something meaningful to send a message that is just the start of something, at least for everyone except YSC and LYJ. Because for the rest of the members it was their first variety show as regular members. So I thought they would do something similar but there was nothing.",

The extreme snow in Hokkaido probably interfered with a lot of the original plans (hence us watching maaany bus scenes), and it probably didn't help that Yong Jin had to leave a day early. Plus, I found myself disappointed that with a group of singers and comedians with musical experience, there was barely any musical content.\n\nI don't know if we will get a season two, but I would like to see this cast again, and I would like to see Bo Pil PD do another show.",

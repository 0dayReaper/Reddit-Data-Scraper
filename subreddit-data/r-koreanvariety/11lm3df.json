But they haven't been showing him individually being at home and stuff. He might be busy filming a drama. Most of the actors tend to not appear as much or just disappear out right without a goodbye when they are busy filming a drama or movie. So I'm assuming that might be the case for Oh Minsuk.",

He only appears during big group outings. \n\nIn the past 2-3 years that I have watched the show, I think he only has 1 individual segment (part of the dating relay where he went on a blind date with this youtuber) and another time where he shared a segment with KJK during an Ateez MV shoot.",

    "postText": "I've been a long time RM fan. I followed Rm through its thick and thins even before Jihyo joined as a fixed member.   \n\n\nRM had its up and a long way down. IMO, It started at 150+ (sure their are fun eps here and there but still... ) up until Sechan and Somin joined the gang. In my honest opinion even before Gary left the show, the show's content was slowly declining due to their focus shifting more into games rather than the cast strong Chemistry.  \n\n\nLong story short, after yearsss of PD changes after myuk PD leave the show, The new PD finally found RM's most strongest point: CAST CHEMISTRY. (i really have to emphasize this). During their first years, the PDs have built their characters alongside their chemistry. then years later, previous PDs underestimated the cast's variety power. They heavily relied on hard missions and like \"funny\" missions to make the show entertaining. What they didn't know is this cast is capable of turning a very simple game to become a variety entertaining one.  \n\n\nChoi Po BIl, current RM pd, fortunately realized this trait and empowers this trait even more. And I'm more than thankful for that. Newer RM episode is a lot more laid back and fun to watch compared to others. Bo Pill greatly utilizes the cast chemistry with a much more simpler games where their variety instinct could manifest spontaneously. Even Rm's new editing style feels more at home this days. It honestly just felt like were watching a crazy family  doing random stuff to each other. Even the screen time isn\u2019t focused solely to anyone. (given they really do something fun)  \n\n\nTL:DR; Choi Bo Pill (new RM pd) realized that what made running man's successful isn't games but The cast's tight chemistry. As an avid longtime Rm fan, Kudoz to this new team, and keep it up this way!",

Watching them interact through simple games is enough to make me laugh for the 1.5h! It really does feels extra homey watching this family come together to mess with each other every week. Kudos to Bo Pil PD! I hope he continues to show us more of their bickering and tight-knit friendship\u2665\ufe0f",

He also made nametag ripping game fresh again. I\u2019m glad Bo Pil PD has the same vision and he even does it better in some ways. I got worried when Chul Min left the show and Bo Pil\u2019s first few episodes felt a bit awkward for me, but nowadays it\u2019s perfect.",

The members were more motivated during this time than ever before and since and that made it absolutely captivating to watch.  \n\nRM now might be a victim of circumstance (COVID as well as budget) but I miss the RM episodes where the competition legitimately mattered versus $50 prizes for the winners and being splashed by a cup of water as the punishment. I understand that bars of gold aren't going to be given away anymore but the punishments need to be juiced up. As in the beginning of RM, something as simple going to home on the subway in hot pants as the punishment should be brought back.",

Those games relied on luck, and if you're a long time watcher, you'll surely know what will happen next.\n\nCant argue about the long term projects.

Episodes that could've been really exciting game wise have turned out the opposite because of the rules not being smart enough. \n\nThe episodes are still nice and all, but not as superb as they were during the beginning of his stint.

It\u2019s true that some games are hilarious and the name tag ripping game will always be iconic, but considering the members\u2019 age, I would much rather they just interact with each other and play less physical games that can still bring out their characters and produce many funny moments!

Because since Gary left, there's been a bunch of mediocre episodes, there's been some bad episodes and there's been a bunch of superb episodes.  \n\n\nIt's not worth it to watch all of it just to catch up. Especially considering that the PDs have changed and the style of the show evolved a lot over the years since Gary left. So if people tell you all the good episodes, you can then catch up until this new PD took over and start watching each episode :)",

(Some eps i cant remember the number but the concept and sometimes guess a i remember)\n\nEp.536 - 538 (very entertainig and the most recent one, no guest)\nEp 40 the yyulmae and kookmae\nThe ep where byung gyu and im sohyang guesting\nThe ep where jomin rejoined after a short hiatus\nThe family project. The one where sangyeob, dahee, hana and jinyoung joined for a couple of eps.\nActually enjoyed watching latest black pink apperance ep\nThe reincarnation ep ver 2020\n2017 or 2018 christmas ep were So hyun joined as an MC.(first christmas ep after gary left)\nAny episode where Jessi appeared.\nAll Cha taehyun episode apperances.\nSweet home and penthouse cast eps.\n\nI honestly cant remember all haha. But those eps were very memorable to me. Major tip, if your looking for fun episodes just kindly avoid episode were idol group guests.( idol guests tones down their craziness due to some toxic fans negative comments)\nLook for episodes with no guests all of them are good \ud83d\udc4c",

I really really appreciate it!! :)",

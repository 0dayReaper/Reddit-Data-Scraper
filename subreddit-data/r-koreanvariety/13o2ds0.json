    "postText": "Gyeongsang-do Rematch Sealed!\n\nClear as day, the weakness of our defense line is a threat to our own existence. Second half was like a war scene that can be seen in Tv dramas. One mistake and everyone needs to run twice, nope, thrice the usual speed. It is a match that shown Han Geon Kyu's weakness little by little. Kim Dong Hyun is the original GK. Lee Hyung Taik, no future. Kim Yo Han, gone.  Will the history repeat itself?\n\nAttacking sides are near to perfection, thanks to Kyu-Gyu Line. Midfields- Heo Min Ho, Lee Dae Hoon. But defense? I'm quite disappointed with today's match. If only they can block the first goal, if only Lee Jang Kun and Andre Jin use his brain more, if only all of our players can play the rest of the game calmly. We will meet Jeju next time, the strongest team out of the rest. The Number 1 amateur soccer team in Jeju. If? Its a precious lesson that we got from the match. If all of our weakness are shown here, what's left for Jeju? \n\nThe War is Not Over! Not until the players got their act together. Not until we bring Jeju to their knees and claim the Title Match! But, what if everything is too late? Will it be the end? One's effort doesn't last long without teamwork. Eojjeoda Avengers, please unite and work hard together!\n\n(P.S. I thought its gonna be a coming-from-behind goal kinda scene but it turned out like a Death Match in the second half. Please watch the full match on kokoatv or OnDemandKorea. Link down below).",

I dont understand korean and I was wondering what AJH told Han Gun Kyu about his performance during the break time. \n\nthe defenders were lacking during this match. \n\nthank you so much u/nas_emerald00. looking forward to more of your post.",

AJH's point of view\u27a1\ufe0fwe can score  more goals if they block the first goal.\n\nIf you notice, in the first half, we are desperate to score the first goal. Players used more energy than they should have. Thats why I said the second half is like a war scene. We got a few chances to score a goal, but because of lack of energy, we can't focus. They were too rushing in this game. They should have stayed calm even after the opponent scored first.\n\nToo many passes missed. Lost few corner kick goals (I'm watching you, Lee Dae Hoon). Andre Jin's heading is a waste. Lee Jang Kun repeatedly made the same mistake(Thank you, Heo MIn Ho, Ryu Eun Kyu, Park Je- un and others for calling him out. I thought they gonna fight or something \ud83d\ude06) Everything that we worked for from the past matches went up to smoke. What will happen when we meet Jeju then? I am so worried about them \ud83d\ude1e especially when I saw Captain Lim Nam Kyu in episode 94 trailer\ud83d\ude22\n\n(P.S. the most used sentence in this match is 'Get your act together')",

            "comment": "Before I talk about the team, I need to mention Janme FC's #9. That collision with Kunkyu should have been an immediate concussion check, no doubts no arguments. The fact that he was allowed to return to the field\u2014and keep playing for so long\u2014is astounding. He was already making comments about memory loss during the game... I sincerely hope he's alright.\n\nLike always, the Avengers' worst enemy is their pacing. They're always in a hurry, especially under pressure. This isn't just a defensive problem\u2014we miss a lot of chances and allow counters because of a frantic offense. It doesn't take much for them to crack under stress, which is something both the audience and opposing teams have known for a long time now.\n\nThat being said, I don't like the excessive reaction to their mistakes at all. When it comes to \"ice vs fire\" play-style, the team has always been on the emotional side since day one. So to make it look like the team were fighting within themselves or have bad blood on the field (like with the team trying to keep Jangkun focused or Jeun being frustrated by his pass misses) rubs me the wrong way. This is football. Frustration comes out on the field even at the most professional level. Critiquing and analyzing is important, but let's not make mountains out of molehills.\n\nAll in all, this game was NOT good for my blood pressure! I haven't yearned for the ending whistle this bad since the world cup ended. (And I'm very glad Gyugyu went out for lunch and a coffee that day!)",

I'm most worried about our defense conceding a goal during this time. Nightmare scenario: they concede 2 and we have to chase a 3-2 score to win. Of course, I may just be underestimating our defense. But seeing how they were this week... rain and a physical team is going to test them further. \n\nHopefully I am wrong! \ud83e\udd1e",

Can you imagine they need to fly to Jeju and play in the rain?\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I cant protect my babies even if I want to \ud83d\ude22 JTBC is really playing with our hearts with the trailer.\n\nWhat's your prediction? Win 1-0? Penalty shootout again? Or no chance at all? \n\nThey better did well this time. Fight to death! (Not literally\ud83e\udd2d)",

I hope this time, this wont happen. \n\n2:1 win for Eojjeoda. \n\neojjeoda avengers fighting.",

Based on the comment section, it looks like AJH brought our own referess from Hyochang Stadium. \n\nThe comment that you were asking for is about how the Korean Football Association should give monthly allowance/subsidy to Mungchan as there are lots of football fans that would take interest in the show. I disagree with this statement as KFA involves in lots of match-fixing in Korean football scenes.\n\n\nYou are killing me with the task\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I had to translate to English first and then slow read it in Korean to make sure that it has the same meaning.

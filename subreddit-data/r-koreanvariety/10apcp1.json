    "postText": "# Description\n\n&gt; Love Catcher is a show featuring a group of men and women coming together for love or money. In this event, men and women who do not know each other will live in the same house. But before moving into the house, participants must choose between two identities: 'Love Catcher' or 'Money Catcher'. Later, 'Money Catcher' was seen forming sincere relationships with other 'Love Catchers'. On the other hand, 'Money Catcher' can win almost $50,000 if they can become a couple with 'Love Catcher' at the end of the show. When making romantic advances, there's an added mood of caution as participants can only guess who's there for love or money. \n\n# Panel\n\n* Jang Do Yeon\n* Joo Woo Jae\n* Jun Hyun Moo\n* Gabee\n* Kim Yo Han\n\n# Cast\n\nMale Participants\n* Park Yong Ho - [@hoho_dragon](https://www.instagram.com/hoho_dragon/)\n* Cho Seong Beom - [@laul_sb](https://www.instagram.com/laul_sb/)\n* Park Jung Hyun - [@junghyuniiii](https://www.instagram.com/junghyuniiii/)\n* Kim Yoon Soo Ro - [@kimyunsuro](https://www.instagram.com/kimyunsuro/)\n* Kwak Tae Hyeok - [@kwak_taehyeok](https://www.instagram.com/kwak_taehyeok/)\n\nFemale Participants\n* Kim Hyo Jin - [@h3_1o](https://www.instagram.com/h3_1o/)\n* Hwang Soo Ji - [@t_110771](https://www.instagram.com/t_110771/)\n* Lee Yu Jeong - [@ririyujeong](https://www.instagram.com/ririyujeong/)\n* Choi Tae Eun - [@c.taeeun](https://www.instagram.com/c.taeeun/)\n* Hong Seung Yeon - [@applemang0o](https://www.instagram.com/applemang0o/)\n\n\n# Episode Links\n\n|Info|Link|Notes|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|RAW|[Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15Y411y711/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click)||\n|Stream|[VIU](https://www.viu.com/ott/sg/en-us/vod/469905/Love-Catcher-in-Bali)|^(ENG SUB)|\n|Softsub|[Download](https://link.emediaarts.net/lovecatcherinbali/lcib-episode-8)|^(ENG SUB)|\n\n# Previous Discussions\n\n|Episode(s)|\n|:-:|\n|[01](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yyjiu2/love_catcher_in_bali_e01_221118/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [02](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z487z3/love_catcher_in_bali_e02_221125/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [03](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zafwqf/love_catcher_in_bali_e03_221202/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [04](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zn8wt2/love_catcher_in_bali_e04_221216/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)|\n|[05](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zta8sb/love_catcher_in_bali_e05_221223/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [06](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zyutpg/love_catcher_in_bali_e06_221230/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [07](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/104nw9x/love_catcher_in_bali_e07_230106/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)|\n\n___\nTHE DISCUSSION BELOW MAY CONTAIN ***SPOILERS***",

If she chose Love, she would have given him hopes again, and she had to act like she liked him too for the show, it's just too awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nThe better choice was always Money, she was not attracted to him, that was the only way to turn him down clearly and logically, it's not like she could just run away.

Hence since YJ has no true love for TH, the $ 50,000 will be more worth it. !&lt;\n\nI have to admit, &gt;! it\u2019s kind of heart breaking watching TH, !&lt; he seems to be so genuine and truthful throughout the show and has never waver. YJ even gave him hope in the end. &gt;!But unfortunately, YJ just does not feel that fluttering feeling for him.!&lt;",

And also when JH speaks to YJ you can see her being nervous, shy and smiling. When YJ realises JH 1st choice is HJ together with the fact that he is MC on that get together night, she couldn\u2019t compose herself and when straight into the kitchen to cry. You would not be so affected unless you have some feelings. \n\nTo TH, YJ was more of \u2018thank you for liking me and we can try to hang out\u2019 kind of vibe. I guess TH type is only YJ out of all the female participants hence he was just trying hard to score. \n\nBut it seems YJ likes abit of thrill. TH gives her too much certainty as for JH, he is more ambiguous and makes YJ more curious about his feelings for her.",

And now that I knew their identity feel like a dumbass as I were suspicious of them from the start. Especially SB, He's just built that way huh?\n\nLike TH himself said, he was just too unlucky, YJ got his hopes up and that led to his heartbreak. Poor guy, He's one of my fav. But i understand YJ's choice though and at least someone had to take that money.\n\nI think the casts are one of the best among Dating shows I've seen and this season became one of my fav too. I love that everyone could be LC in the end if things had worked out for them. Some of my fav casts didn't get the happy ending, at least they got their closure and had no regret.

They are just so cute and their journey was the highlight of the entire love catcher series imo \n\nSB and SJ are two peas in a pot, they\u2019re both super cringy esp SB, but it works for their relationship. Someone on here said they are are on the same wavelength and I couldn\u2019t agree more, she looked happier and more comfortable with him compared to YH. YH was too intense and didn\u2019t know how to express himself properly, SJ is the type of girl who wants to be showed off and pampered and feel loved and that\u2019s what SB gave her. Good for them! \n\nI do not agree with how YJ handled that whole thing. Personally I think that was nothing but her being spiteful bc she knew TH had genuine feelings for her and she knew way before hand that she didn\u2019t like him at all that\u2019s why she only texted JH. Compare to the other seasons where the MC was revealed this one was too brutal. I get her being mad and all and at the end of the day she got some money but I would have rather she went out with her head held high knowing she was true to her feelings despite everything, instead of picking some who genuinely had feelings for her. She could\u2019ve still picked JH too \ud83d\udc80 they just would\u2019ve walked away with nothing. Also I\u2019m shocked TH didn\u2019t pick up on the signs that she was not interested in him at all, like there wasn\u2019t an ounce of interest. their date before she picked said everything, even the way she gave him the ring, and the actual trip. It was very uncomfortable to watch, she also looked uncomfortable the entire time.\n\nI also hate how the panel was like \u201coh JH didn\u2019t even see her when they first picked\u201d and basically excused him for being a MC but when TE did it they were like \u201cnah she gotta go\u201d \u201cshe\u2019s a terrible person\u201d knowing she had genuine feelings for SR the entire time and she herself said she regretted picking MC from the beginning.",

SB initially came off as fake/disingenuous, but that was just his cheesy personality lol.\n\nSJ and SB interaction with one another (the way they look at each other, playful touching, body language etc) made it obvious they were super into one another.\n\nTH is a nice guy, but I don't blame YJ at all for taking the money.  She showed very little interest in him and was not leading him on with her actions or words.  She was clearly not into him and from the few scenes of them together, it was verging on her having the \"ick\" for him.\n\nWhether she chose to give him the ring with plans to go for the money or to give him a chance, she didn't do anything wrong.  Ultimately she was honest with him and herself throughout the final date.  This isn't like season 2 where what's his name continually faked his intense love/interest for GB.  Which while slightly evil was also an incredible performance.\n\nLastly people need to remember, TH has only known YJ for 4 or 5 days and in that time she's barely shown much interest in him.  Getting rejected isn't that big of a deal nor should it be surprising.\n\nI really wish there was a reunion episode.",

Idk...that just seems a bit cruel. So if I was in her position and I came for love but didn't find it, I think I would have just left without love and moved on with my life.\n\nHowever, I don't blame YJ at all though.Things just didn't work out the way she hoped so she just played the game and got her bag. Nothing wrong with that. \n\nAll members come into the show knowing what the consequences are, plus, I think they're only there for a couple of weeks at most(?). So I'd imagine no one that's 'betrayed' would be leaving with any type of psych trauma, so all is fair. I just personally don't think I would've been able to make the same decision as YJ. I would've just ended things by not giving anyone the ring, if my initial intent was love.",

If she were MC from the start, it's a no-brainer but the fact that she was so hurt by finding out that JH was MC bc she liked him  (even though he stated he liked HJ more). It's almost like she was trying to get her revenge in a way and snag that cash, but she had zero thought for TH.\n\nImo, TH was the best guy on the show, I was lukewarm when he first joined but he cracked me up when he thought the text was from PDs and his kind, considerate personality just shone throughout. Also who can forget the 2% spit-take!\n\nSo to see YJ take advantage of his feelings was icky to watch, I wish she could have chosen JH and swapped to MC then...it would have made a lot more sense. TH should have been left out of it!\n\nThis has been my fave season of LC, also SI2 was blah for me so I looked forward to LC every week. This may be one of the top dating show seasons of all time.",

TE is my favourite but HJ is also have all the desirable gf characteristics (intelligent, reasonable, value communication and pretty of course).\n\n- Maybe because I\u2019m a girl, I didn\u2019t find SJ or YJ have any charm other their looks. SY is cool but too bad she had fallen too deep for SR and became miserable, didn\u2019t bother to show off her charms to anyone else. Well, can\u2019t blame her, SR is definitely a gem.\n\n- The relationship that works out was the one between LC and MC (who switched at the end). TE-SR and Sera-JJ (season 2) proved that. And that are the girls who switched. Their connection and feelings must be deep and big enough to make such decisions. That\u2019s why those relationships last. The relationship between LC-LC couldn\u2019t worked out because it was only a crush, for such short amount of time and it\u2019s understandable.\n\nAnyways, this is such a good season \ud83e\udd70",

TE and SR are so great together, I hope they stay together. The hosts with the ageism and not liking the age gap can GTFO. \n\nSJ and SB are so cringe, the only saving grace would've been one of them being a MC but no they're just boring and cringe through and through. That last day with them seemed almost like one of them realised they needed to leave the show with a good impression so they upped the 'chemistry' on the last day. Judging by the comments here, it sounds like the relationship didn't last and I'm not surprised at all. \n\nI felt bad for TH at the end however I understand YJ going for the money - it is part of the game after all and I don't think the show would've ended well without a MC winning. \n\nSY and YH were really annoying for me for some reason. Both kept going for someone who  were not into them. The hosts lauded it as 'courageous' but it just felt insensitive and self-serving to me. Yongho I can understand because SooJi was giving mixed signals but Sooro definitely wasn't. Yongho needs to stop ducking and slinking away every time SB shows up and SB needs to stop treating SJ like an object but she clearly likes it so good for them? \n\nOutside of TE and SR, I was really rooting for Hyojin. She seemed mature and level headed, I was hoping she'd at least win some money. There was no chemistry with Yongho even if they did talk for a long time, that guy is just... \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.",

Yes, I do feel bad for TH. He was actually my favorite guy (arguably my favorite this season) on the show since he was so sincere and endearing to watch as an individual. However, I can\u2019t hate on a participant who played the game exactly how it was designed. I expected things like this when I started watching. \n\nThere are 2 ways to win the show. To leave with love or with money. She knew she couldn\u2019t leave with love since JH was MC AND had HJ as his first choice, so she decided to get the money. How are people expecting JH to pick YJ and switch to LC when there was only about a day or two left? Her accomplishing that would have been EXTREMELY unlikely. \n\nWishing she spared TH feelings is fine. I wished the same! But please stop acting as if there was another way for her to win. Going after JH wouldn\u2019t have been easy. EP 7 made it bluntly clear that her only option was to lose or win by getting money. She made the decision that she thought was best for her and still play by the rules. \n\nBefore the finale aired, people wanted YJ to give up on JH because they liked him more with HJ. But now people wished she pursued JH? That doesn\u2019t make any sense. If she managed to sway JH, I just know people would hate on her because of their ship. People don\u2019t want YJ to pursue JH but also want her to try to sway him to save TH\u2019s feelings? \n\nJust because she made a decision that was hard to watch, doesn\u2019t mean she is evil or made the wrong call. \n\nI\u2019m getting really tired of people trying to make someone on a reality show a villain. Unless they do something like being sexist, racist, bullying, etc, they are not villains. They are real people put in a situation specifically design to create drama, cause stress, and make difficult decisions. This shouldn\u2019t be a hard concept to grasp.",

                    "comment": "I don't think YJ is a \"villain\" or \"evil\" but the decision she made, which ofc was her right to make, hurt TH's feelings and was a pretty callous decision.   YJ cried when she found out JH was MC, her feelings were hurt, even though JH wasn't even set on her at that point. So she knows how it feels.  You said there are only two choices, love or money. That's not true. She didn't have to accept either ring. She could have left alone.   Again, I'm not blaming her, I'm just stating facts.\n\nShe could have left alone, but she chose to pick a nice guy who obviously had sincere feelings for her, and then changed to MC to win the cash. She could have chosen the guy she actually liked in JH, and then if she felt he really wouldn't swap to LC, she could have gotten her revenge in swapping to MC. So of the three options, she made the one that took advantage of a decent guy's feelings.  That's the truth. She played the game well, hats off to her, but this whole idea of \"there was no other way to win\" is bull.\n\nAgain, yes let's be kind to all contestants, I don't think YJ is \"evil\" at all, but let's not pretend she had no other options.",

                            "comment": "I\u2019m glad we agree that we should be kind to all contestants. However, you definitely misread/misinterpreted most of the main points I made. \n\nThe whole premise of the show is to match with some1 looking for love regardless of your own identity. This means that MCs are expected to lie and play with feelings. The participants know what show they are on and are aware of all possibilities. They signed up knowing that there was a chance they would be taken advantage of, especially the LCs. The only difference between YJ and your average MC is that she wanted love first. Other than that, she behaved like any other ordinary MC, which is giving someone false hope. Sincerity doesn\u2019t always matter in this show. \n\nI can see why you and others are especially disappointed in YJ since she knows how it feels like to be no. 2, but I don\u2019t see how that suddenly makes her callous. Was what she did sad? Yes. But she played it smart and safe for herself in an environment where you can\u2019t trust everyone without having doubts beforehand. What is callous in other shows is fair-game in Love Catcher. \n\nI never said that love and money were the only two options. I said that leaving with love (aka a relationship) or leaving with money were the only two ways to WIN the show (2nd paragraph). Which is the real fact. I later mentioned that EP 7 made it clear that she can either lose (aka no relationship or $) or win as a MC because JH wasn\u2019t that into her. Therefore, I ALWAYS acknowledge that leaving with nothing was an option. I simply just call the option as it was, which was losing the show.\n\nThose were her two MAIN options. All other possibilities were heavily unlikely. People are acting as if it would have been easy to get JH to give up on HJ. The time where she found out she was his no. 2 was no more than a day before she had to give the ring someone. Giving a ring and having some1 accept it is the path she needed to take in order to win.\n\nYou said that if YJ believe that JH would not swap to love, she could switch to money and get revenge. I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t completely understand that. If JH is still a MC, her switching to MC wouldn\u2019t be winning. She still lose the show because she leaves with no money or love. The only thing she would accomplished is ruining his chances at money. I understand how some might think that would be a girlboss moment, but I personally disagree. Getting even doesn\u2019t count as winning, but to each their own I guess. \n\nBut it\u2019s vital to remember that YJ needs to convince JH to give up on HJ to even get the chance of \u201crevenge\u201d. If it\u2019s hard to complete step 1 (aka remove HJ from the picture and get JH to accept her ring), why would step 2 (aka the \u201crevenge\u201d) be something she even think about? It\u2019s bull to believe YJ can accomplish all of that in what little time they have left. Let\u2019s not pretend that every option is equally possible.\n\nSome people take a leap of faith and hope for the best. Others cut their losses and go after what they believe to be the next best thing. Neither view points are inherently wrong, especially in this show. She wants to leave with something, and I personally think that is fair and not callous.\n\nEdit: Someone mentioned this before, but I also think there is a POSSIBILITY she gave the ring to TH to give him a chance. We will never know exactly what is happening in her mind though. For all we know, the participants could have lied to the viewers sometimes.",

He chose his target from the start, and not just any target, Ga Bin was the most popular cast in that season, he acted like he was madly in love with her, no change whatsoever, totally one-girl man, and the poor girl fell for it.\n\nNow from my POV, YJ had to make that choice as she didn't feel any thing for the guy, that's all. During the rings exchange time, she was not that uncomfortable with him, and decided to give him a chance as HJ was not justworthy. But then during the date, TH once again moved too fast, way too fast, it turned her off. So what could she do then? if she stayed as LC, she would have to face him, pretend to be lovey dovey with him for the show. Why not just turned him down and take the money while you can?\n\nWell she might have chosen TH and planned to change to MC from the start, but still, how can you compare her to Chan Woo, he's the best villain of all dating shows hands down!",

I honestly think she coulda communicated w him that she wasn\u2019t feeling him at least cause then I know he would\u2019ve accepted it and probably woulda told her himself to switch to money. imo she had it planned since the JH situation happened which I can\u2019t blame her for lol JH reveal truly shook her. I mean I wish she coulda at least connected the dots and realised JH chose MC before he even knew she existed but still woulda hit hard. Anyways I would much rather be in Gabins shoes than TH tbh. I\u2019d rather be with someone who\u2019s MC all the way through rather than someone that changes to MC. Would seem more heartbreaking. But anyways to end it of Chan Woo is a legendary dating show member of all time. Top 3 simply for his villainous arc lmao was great",

Sure people might be rooting for LC to always win in the end but YJ just plain out said that she just wasn't attracted to him so might as well get that MC win. Not really sure about the hate she getting regardless, she just played by the rules got fooled then went back in and took the prize.\n\nI'm also not much of a fan of how they ended the people who didn't get the ring. I felt like they should've been given an additional opportunity to make one last try and all that but it just seemed anti climactic to just have them leave instead of giving like at least one last opportunity after having people change or finding out their dates identity.

Best moment - the way SJ ran to SB with a ring as soon as she entered the house. it is a best moment because i just didn't want SJ-YJ to happen, and i like he got burned.. blinded by beauty and the way he was .. just so underconfident and dumb\n\n2a- to be honest YJ-SJ would have been like uncle - high school cheer leader combo\n\n3. Sometimes no twists and predictability can be precious - we know which couple is that\n\n4. YJ gets no sympathy and basically summarized her personality - vicious and vindictive and self centered\n\n5. HJ .. lol.. beauty with brains. i bet she would have never changed her identity but what i liked was her not even picking up the ring\n\n6. SY - forgettable presence\n7. TH - i guess  just left with positive image\n8. JH - it was fun while it lasted. But, think his case was same as YH just less stupid - he also really like HJ for her beauty \n\n9. Question - if JH was serious about changing identity, or if he really liked HJ why not go with her.. even if he guessed she was MC. Lets say he felt too bad about YJ and hence wanted to give her the chance.. that's pity then.. he wouldn't have changed his identity.. so was going to hurt her again\n\n\n9. Mystery of the season - other than SB, it beats me why anyone would be so devoted to SJ over any of those girls\n\n\n10. biggest disappointment - really wanted one to change the identity. LOL.. this has to be the first LC-LC couple with no identity switches and yet.. audience hoping for one to be MC.. how much we wanted to see them/either suffer",

Actually I also thought initially that SungBum was MC as well but it seems it was just his personality.\n* So **happyyyyyyyyy for SooRo and TE.** This one was no surprise, SooRo is an absolute gem and so smart and wise - I did not doubt a second that our girl Tae Eun would make the right decision. \n* **I think YuJeong's decision was reasonable and logical** (taking into account that this is a TV game). The man she liked had confirmed that not only he preferred HyoJin but that he was also a MC. She clearly had no interest in Tae Hyeok, we have been knowing it for 2-3 episodes. So, since she was going to reject him anyway, at least get 50k was an intelligent move. And her manipulation was so light, she was really cold and distant to TH the previous day - even for 50k, she could not get herself to actively pretend liking him. I was more surprised that TH really expected them to date after the desastrous evening. \n* **HyoJin could have played better her MC card.** She knew Jung Hyun had an interest in her, and even if he was a MC, he said he was willing to change. Since she liked Jong Ho and had nothing to lose anymore, she should have gone directly to Jung Hyun to give him her ring (before him giving it to YuJeong), played the card \"I don't care that you are MC, I fully trust you when you say you are going to change and I want to give us a chance\" and then done everything to make him switch. So that at least one of them would get 50k instead of nothing. But maybe I am too cruel here...?",

It's an account that inhabits korean entertainment subreddits but mostly here. I wouldn't to surprise to learn if it's an account maintained by multiple people. In all probability it's looks suspiciously like an account paid to promote K and C dating programs.",

                                    "comment": "Lol... don't worry since a lot of other people have said I'm a bot too. And I copy and paste because the questions/etc. are always the same thing.\n\nSigh. I'm just a regular guy with a lot of free time that took advantage of Single's Inferno 2's 1 month popularity height to spread the word about other East Asian dating shows.\n\nLike look at Love Catcher in Bali, it's a million years ahead of whatever Single's Inferno is, lol.\n\nJust as a disclaimer again: I am not affiliated/etc. with Netflix/Viki/VIU/Disney+/et cetera. I do not work for any dating show production company (that includes Netflix and other streaming services btw since they kinda directly fund them these days), same with marketing companies, and so on. \n\nI do not get paid with anything to promote these shows. Some people are just overly invested real fans you know... No that's not snark, sarcasm, et cetera, I really am just like those Kpop fans you see on Youtube/etc. comments randomly talking about their favorite group or idol member, rofl.\n\nDo not read the below text unless you have free time or want to ruin the illusion. Haha.\n\n---\n\nAs I've said a few times before, if I was rich instead of being broke, as in credit card debt and no own house/etc. broke, I'd actually do the marketing myself by putting up banners of dating shows everywhere on Youtube/other sites and in real life. But again, I can only type so much even with the aid of copy and paste.\n\nI've received blocks/etc. for this account because I basically spammed the hell out of Single's Inferno 2 threads, lmao. And so sometimes all I see are \"deleted\" or \"unavailable\" and I'd have to log out to see wtf is going on since sometimes the threads seem interesting.\n\nBut due to the way reddit does its blocking feature, if somebody blocked you then you can't see their comment, though you can see the replies to their comment. And then if you want to add your quip/advice/etc. then you can't because reddit removed the option to do that.\n\nLike it's mindboggling how the ignore/block/etc. function on reddit works, I didn't even know it existed in this form until I had several Single's Inferno 2 fans block me for randomly segueing about Love Catcher in Bali, some other Korean dating shows, or the Chinese dating shows.\n\nYou'd think it's like a mutual block or something but then they actually make it easy for the blocked person to find out who blocked them. And so I have no idea wtf is going on.\n\nFml, I overexplained and went too specific again. Sigh.\n\n---\n\n\n**If you doubt even these current written words, there's ways to time travel or search through somebody's stuff before. Check Wayback Machine, unddit, /r/pushshift, etc.**\n\n**Like search up the various versions for Reddit Search powered by Pushshift, here's one for my account: https://camas.unddit.com/#{%22author%22:%22mnlyyzyeg%22,%22resultSize%22:100}**\n\nIf you check the account activity, I am actually a really infrequent poster aside from this past few months. I'm a lurker, not a participant in these communities. Except /r/terracehouse, that's where I (and many other (Netflix) East Asian dating show fans) posted back then, with the same rambling paragraphs: **https://camas.unddit.com/#{%22author%22:%22mnlyyzyeg%22,%22subreddit%22:%22terracehouse%22,%22resultSize%22:100}**\n\n\nYou can even go all forensic on it to see non-dating shows related content. Most of it should be true, or false, you never know, rofl. It depends on if you have time to read all of the meandering paragraphs or walls of text.\n\nYou can see me there edit my comments a lot sometimes. You can see me delete, repost comments because I missed several words, have spelling mistakes, want to reword or add stuff, and so on.\n\nYou can even see some mods and so on remove/hide/etc. my comments because they're off-topic or way too long for no reason. \n\nI'm actually really into reading/writing and so that's why sometimes when I write something it can digress into whatever random stuff. Could be ADHD/et cetera, could be just me flexing my knowledge, could be sleep-deprivation making the focus worse, etc.\n\nSometimes I am also raw/honest/asshole-like/etc. when it comes to certain visuals or situations. You can also see me virtue signal once in a while. But for the most part I try to defuse the situation or be nonchalant because I really have no time or emotional capacity to argue. \n\nEspecially not when I'm often hitting 5000 characters or even the maximum 10000 characters for a comment if it's not a copy and pasted one. I'm an extremely fast reader and writer due to my academic/etc. background and even I still have to take an hour or so sometimes to type, even if it seems low effort. Who really bout wasting time on dating shows if they getting paid nothing for it? The fans with a lot of free time, lol, maybe.\n\nBecause again, if you've been in the internet long enough, even though Google or the search button is right there, it's always like a repetition for some people. Like crowdsourcing is good for updated new info but for the most part things are the same as before.\n\n---\n\nOkay, this is getting way too long. I'm not often that defensive/insecure/etc. but it's kinda sad how there's people or mods in other subreddits that are clearly using bot accounts. Or like they have scripts for their account and also the submissions.\n\nBut then my incessant posting of East Asian dating shows gets branded as bot activity or astroturfing/shilling/etc. Like damn, sometimes I want to feel like the world is against me too (Hey Google, play IVE's Love Dive, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8JFxS1HlDo&amp;t=41s), but thankfully there's only like five or fewer than ten people that have asked directly this past few months if I am a real person or not.\n\nNo, this is a simulation. I am just an NPC. Beep bop. Not main character.\n\nAnd yes, I will be toning down the spam/random segueing/etc. when it comes to linking the same reddit threads that have my own repeated paragraphs on them.\n\nAfter all, it does get tiring af seeing the same shit over and over. Lol. But that's life when you have a lot of free time, you also see the same people doing the same things. It's just how it be.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR: Sorry for the spam guys, I didn't mean to come across like that, I just wanted people to share the same great experience that I have with East Asian dating shows.\n\nSee this thread for me overexplaining (same words basically) why I am not paid by anybody and how I am literally wasting my time trying to be excited about East Asian dating shows, lol: https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/10879dp/my_problem_with_the_message_this_show_sends/j3qvna2/. Check the Pushshift sites if that thread link is unavailable, I'm too lazy to check right now to see if the link is working. \n\n\nThis is another thread about how I'm just a superfan of these East Asian dating shows, more so escapism: https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/108rozg/s2_raised_the_bar_to_new_heights_s3_needs_to_be/j3v1ioa/. Sometimes with the extensive knowledge, people can get egotistic, arrogant, etc. but for me I try to remain neutral and just introduce the dating shows with minimal spoilers and such. At least I hope so, obviously it's not always the case.\n\n---\n\nMay be an interesting fact: I actually contribute somewhat directly to the dating shows fandom (and other communities) in other ways aside from repeating the same East Asian dating shows recommendations over and over. But that's a behind the scenes story for another time.\n\nFor other calming/maybe interesting/slice of life and so on stuff, check some of the things below.\n\nUsually I'm actually just playing video games, reading books, listening to /r/ASMR triggers, and so on during my free time. Oh and watching those western/Anglo/etc. films and so on too.\n\n**Check here if you want some recent grimdark fantasy/science fiction recommendations: https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgressionFantasy/comments/zhfqs4/what_is_the_best_new_progression_fantasy_that_you/izn463r/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/zi75s9/spanish_dark_fantasy_aesthetics_and_settings/izqwwr1/**\n\n**To chill and for more optimistic and relaxing stuff, this is a studying or just audio triggers ASMR list**: https://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/xtf23y/discussion_asmr_for_studying/iqqc3d3/\n\n**And then this is a multilingual/etc. ASMRtists list**: https://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/watnwx/questionhey_everyone_is_anyone_out_there_a/ii3qnyv/\n\nI have other recommendations that's not strictly related to slice of life shows, but yes, this is not a blog/et cetera, this is me just being an excessive fan of these East Asian dating shows. Nothing more to it.\n\nAgain, I'm more of a consumer of these East Asian media stuff and they give me easy happiness. I just want people to share the same good experience as I know it can be really helpful for some other people.",

[Jinho, Dex and Hyunji at the casino on the 2nd day (i.e. first day without Jimin) trying to win more money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUBgLlvq2b4).\n\nThere is some MNet level evil editing here:\nI must laugh at the scene when Xitsuh describes the roles of the hidden team:\n\n\"Hyunji seemed to be in charge of making the fire.\": &gt;!camera shows her making fire!&lt;\n\n\"Dex seemed to be in charge of cooking.\": &gt;!camera shows him cooking!&lt;\n\n\"Jinho was in charge of various things.\": &gt;!camera shows him sleeping!&lt;\n\nAlso I don't like the fact the way the ambush game is designed, &gt;!that everything is allowed. breaking glass (I assume they are using sugar glass or those glasses designed for filming) in the darkness. When I see the players holding folding chairs, Mina holding a wooden beam for their defense, that could easily go out of control.!&lt;\n\nAlso what I like about Bloody Game (also in S1) is that the players are so fast uploading their stuff on youtube. Seungjins upload of [episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbPZqoz-yBU) and [episode 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSBPevB537Q) with Pi, Yurisa and Knucks.",

It's nice to see that being older he seems far more assertive and poise. \n\nYurisa is also one of those who can afford to do the same, but her attitude is wow haha. Her attitude reminds me of one of those many \"prodigy\" kid you meet in elementary school. And one of those adults who come once in a blue moon and you think to yourself \"wow how did this person afford to maintain this personality so far in life\".",

Like WTF why is Mina holding a 2x4!!??? Why did they turn off all the lights around the stairs, there is a reason that during a blackout (in the US at least) all highrises have backup lights/glow strips in the stairwells. And I don't even want to start about Seungjin's actions because it's been discussed extensively already.!&lt;\n\nI think the women in the show are being completely outplayed. &gt;!Yurisa was never in control of the game in Ep3. The decision to vote her off to the dungeon kind of proves that the men were never interested in joining forces with the women. Despite this, I think it was a mistake to send her to the dungeon, she's become the final boss of the game and I don't see her losing any mental game unless she is extremely sleep deprived.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Dex's decision to destroy everything at camp was the right move. Very Art of War-like. It's a psychological tactic because it creates a situation where no one wants to come back. I also found it interesting where in S1 Nayoung was called a psychopath by her own teammates, but in S2 no one questions Dex. Could be they all watched S1 and/or sick and tired of the jungle.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Sad that Jimin was eliminated. Her biggest goof was showing Jinhyeong the secret room to try and gain his trust. I know she couldn't have predicted the events that would follow, but if I were in her shoes I would have played more conservatively. I think the Jungle team lucked out by kidnapping a very gullible YunB who happens to be best buds with Knucks. Anyway, I like the brief scene with Jimin with the cats, it was very adorable.!&lt;",

To him having all of that camping gear was a struggle because he is used to a rich lifestyle, and because he is getting old. \n\nOnce Dex started destroying it however, Jinho knows that team work is important (from time hotel) and that you need to pick your battles. Its pointless to fight every decision that your team mates make, so when a team mate doesn\u2019t even consult the team and just starts destroying stuff, you\u2019ve got to make lemons out of lemonade and embrace the positives that come from that decision instead of focusing on the negatives. \n\nThe women were outplayed from the moment the basketball idiot suggested the boys team up and vote off the girls. They could have easily turned their logic against them by stating the fact that the girls were already undermanned and that even if they won the deathmatch it would have only equalized the numbers of women vs men AND even though the numbers would technically be equal, the girls would never be able to trust Pi. They could have also played up the fact that it makes no sense to eliminate weaker players first. \n\nThey could have said something along the lines of \u201cI think we are all in agreement that Pi has to be eliminated because we can\u2019t trust her, however it makes no sense to choose a player that Pi could beat. Even if we consider the worst case scenario and the person we send in loses, its only logical to send the strongest person.\u201c they should have challenged the guy\u2019s manhood, \u201care you afraid that Mina could beat you in a 1v1 later in the show?\u201d. Then I would have ended it by saying \u201cthis girls vs boys thing doesn\u2019t matter anyway because we have a volunteer who is confident that they will be able to beat Pi in the 1v1, and I expect him to win. We need to eliminate Pi while we have the chance.\u201d\n\nThe girls didn\u2019t need to maintain a numbers advantage. All they had to do was persuade the boys to not get sucked into an alliance. The moment they let the guys break away and talk about it alone is when they lost. If they changed the narrative from boys vs girls to Everyone vs Pi, then it would have been a lot easier to split up the guys the day after. You can see how Jimin and Pi were already building up relationships through deals with a couple of the guys. Also in 1v1s it should have been relatively easy to convince a few guys that they don\u2019t want a boys alliance because that will only make their job harder when they make it to the finals and have to fight eachother.",

Because Dex would be needed in the jungle, Jinho is a household name and draws too much attention, and Hyunji's ability was unknown. Though I personally don't agree and would have bet on Hyunji.\n\n6. YunB and Knucks really cracked me up lol. Honestly if Knucks took his time to process the info even for 10 minutes he would have realize he was being duped. He was so confused and YunB became a hero. He mustn't have been kidding when they said they bonded for real.\n\n7. The production team is half screwed up. They kinda encouraged violence. I honestly feel half sorry since Seungjin's reputation went down the drain with this week's release. He was a bastarx but knets are scarier. I see that HSJ is following Pie's footsteps.",

Outside of that she just spent an episode keeping low.\n\nJimin being here nor there, stuck between two major alliances and with her own hidden agenda was doomed. The way how she did get the pot for Dex in her final hours in the game was touching.\n\nJungle team keeps being the best just doing survival, second kidnapping went as smoothly as the first, but i really wonder if it can go on like this.\n\nIf ambush is successful and teams switch, mansion team won't able to just nab people.\n\nEp 4\n\nMaybe it's wanting to root for underdogs but both new jungle recruits somehow stopped looking like massive jerks. Now that Yun B and Xitsu are in the jungle they got more beneficial edits and are simpler to differentiate from other 5 mansion dudes. And both of them pulled their weight. YunB massively betrayed \"dudes\" and confused them to do his job for him, Xitsu broke a pyramid and Dex did the rest.\n\nIn Dex and SeungJin fight, basketball player really comes off super ugly here, after all the shenanigans in ep 3 betraying both Yurisa and Jimin and now this. He kinda did this stuff since the start -- wasn't he the one who started the whole \"let's divide into men and women!\" thing. The guy is overdosing on some high testosterone. The worst part is that he is basically the leader of the group.\n\nSeriously, f (former) mansion people. Cats were really the best part of the mansion.",

To be honest everything that went down on ambush night felt like a Jimin\u2019s karma. Even down the two ppl that ended up in trouble the most (Knucks who was essentially the game mastermind of ep 3 ended up being tricked himself and Yurisa the person who succeeded in eliminating Jimin ended up being sent to the dungeon!&lt; I think it\u2019s safe to say I am fully rooting for the wilderness team.",

He has a natural physical adv over others and should be more careful about how his actions can hurt others. He continued to show no regrets of his actions even later and acted sour to Knucks with that nudge (intentional or not he never said sorry).

He had his hand on Dex\u2019s neck twice while he fixed his murderous stare face to face with a much shorter Dex. Meanwhile, Dex was just using his arms to keep this giant back. You could see Dex controlled himself while the basket baller almost wanted to choke him twice.\n\nThis was when I found Dex\u2019s confidently assertive and defiant look tr\u00e8s sexy! He never once backed down nor looked away from the bballer\u2019s murderous stare down while locked in a testosteroney grapple, nose to unwashed nose. \n\nBefore this, Dex\u2019s first manoeuvre was a strategic one as Goliath caught him by his shirt from the back (loser move). Dex made a swift tactical downwards and back up move which made his liability trap of a shirt slip off from his back faster than you can say Houdini. Any fighter knows he means biz when the shirt is off. \n\nThat probably pissed off the 2.20m giant ex pro bballer even more as he lost his \u201cball\u201d twice in a row to a much faster and smaller guy who did not lose his cool one bit.\n\nDex asked giant what his problem was and evidently it was Dex\u2019s cocky (and sexy) you-can\u2019t-touch-me face, and also presumably his gigantic moulded by UDT balls. \n\nBballer brought up Dex\u2019s physiognomy as a triggering point of conflict while looking like Frankenstein himself. \n\nI would really like a round two of Frankenface vs Dex!

If they kidnapped that smart guy instead of xitsuh, i think they might fail because xitsuh can talk his way through while i think the smart guy wont be able to do it.. I think the producers planned this way to make it 6v6 after raid to balance the game into team matches but Jimin elimination probably shocked them too.. It will be so interesting to have 6v6 with Jimin Jinho Dex vs the other team. Wasted we couldnt see it.. And now that its Jinho is injured, he definitely will be playing as brain while the others have to work as hard at running like in season 1. Where some members have to run twice or even three rounds to cover grounds. Next episode, we finally can see some game play by Jinho.. For 4 episode he only vs those casino games and somehow won it with his insane luck (dice game).",

(1 coaching) He really is a bad teacher since he does teach useful strategies but they're all too hard to follow though/execute for most people. But seems easy enough in theory that these give them hope (even worse than nothing).\n\n(2) And the way he fuck up is: he plays by intuition/mental strength (which gives him an edge against player like Oh Hyunmin (IQ type) in individual matches) EVEN WHEN HE'S A SUPPORTER in these matches. So he became another unexpected variable in the game for the person he supports. And during these times I can almost always read Jinho's mind \"I'm creating u an opening to attack for you why are you not moving???\". Poor guy supported is always too overwhelmed reading the enemy's moves to even read Kong's moves.\n\nYea don't partner up with Kong lol. He doesn't think about  the person he supports and only think about the \"literal best strategy\" in the game and follow through without a second thought. It's like asking the olympic math guy to teach you math for an exam, it's useless. It's better to go to the guy who attempted the exam 9 times and know your struggles.\n\nFunnily enough his starcraft coaching days ended for the exact same reason admittedly so. Maybe his poker earnings are so good because he always eliminates everybody in the same table as him without fail hahahahaha.",

He could have blocked a couple times and made his pieces more useful, but he clearly made a simple plan with his partner and was focusing on executing it. She designed a pattern that she wanted to do to maximize the number of matches she could get, and his Job was to make sure he play different sized rings that wouldn\u2019t block her. \n\nPS. I really hate when teams try to come up with signals in these shows. I swear that shit never works, and they always think that the guy is a genius for suggesting it. If you do signals it has to be something incredibly subtle, like standing on the left or right side of the room, but even that can go wrong because usually someone forgets they are doing signals and at best they figure out that the plan isn\u2019t going to work, but most likely they end up misreading signs causing a lot of self-inflicted damage.",

I didn't really like him in main matches, since his plan were always something along the line of suicide bombing it was impossible to assess his actual skills (much to Jinho's frustrations about Eun Kyu admitting to playing without anything to lose). But I guess that suicide bomber mentality is perfect as a supporter haha. \n\nAND I so get the signal pet peeves. They're in 1 word: impractical. Though for me rather than the gesture, my problem is with the output. Signals works okay for immediate output in simple games with 2-3 possible hands/move (yes/no, rock paper scissors, etc). But using signals to strategize mid air is most of the time dumb. You can even easily stop yourself from suggesting the use of signals, by noticing when the signal equals a verb. Because verbs require proper syntax to be foolproof and it all became too impractical to ever execute.",

Jinho could have hurt his head or even worse in that dark stairs.  \n\n\nHSJ really dont have good sportsmanship coming from a professional sportsman. Dex already broke it and the game ended and he went to grab Dex trying to hurt him. I understand if there is some tension while protecting it but he already broke it. I hope he and yurisa can be eliminated soon. Yurisa personality is so arrogant, i feel thats her real personality and not game personality. With that kind of personality in the real world, its gonna be rough working with her. And she keeps looking down on ppl like shes the best. Totally not humble at all. Feels sad for Jimin, she got bullied outcasted so badly while trying her best to save her friends.",

Granted, she used to give me high blood pressure back in season 1 but it was so freaking endearing how she went about stealing the pot that Dex wanted. Agree that it was a wrong decision to pick her as the spy and I still think Hyunji is the only one suited for that role as she isn't from the previous season or someone they would try to oust for fear of losing to (Jinho).\n* That scramble between Seungjin and Dex was so nerve-racking and possibly the most stressful scene I've seen recently!! I might take time to rewatch it but fuk SJ and his anger issues, he should go home and find a therapist. Went to his reaction on reaction video for these episodes and man's under fire (based on Papago's translation) as he deserve. Also, bravo to Dex his reflexes was so fast and his response/behavior deserves an applause. He was just so cool. And anyone who is cool is an oppa LOL\n* Xitsuh started to grow on me. It was so funny how he quickly answered there's three weak people in the jungle team (Hyunji, Jinho, and him lol) when YunB was discussing the ambush. He's quick witted and reads people quickly so props to Jimin for choosing this guy. I sometimes see him as a puppy who just wants to make the jungle team proud lmao the jungle team really brings out the best in people (that or I am just extremely biased and end up liking every one on jungle team)\n* One of my favorite exchanges is Dex being called \ub610\ub77c\uc774 (ttorai = idiot/fool) esp by Jinho. I love that older brother and dongsaeng energy. It's so funny hearing it and he just takes it in stride.\n* Most of them watched the previous season and they still think it was rude to break the things? The other team had nothing at all not even good clothes when they started. The audacity!!\n* Next week cannot come sooner!!!",

Unfortunately it is her own fault that she was eliminated. She should have worked with Yurisa and the other girls instead of trying to get the boys on her side(which we already know was not gonna happen cause they mistrust her so much). 4v5 with Yurisa's brain could have turned the tides on that main game.",

Remember she caught jimin and the boys in the basement so she lost trust in them. Her social game is bad in the first place, so she probably didn't know how to proceed from that point because from her perspective they were all already in cahoots. I'm not sure she's that good at forming alliances anyway but it's not entirely impossible to win her to your side as long as she doesnt distrust you.",

And I know they had to earn most of the food/shelter but I wonder if they had a porta-potty outdoors with toilet paper cause it would be insane if they had to go the natural route for that too.",

As expected, the PD team know whats up!!!!)\n\n&gt;!Looking at the \"spy must go back to jungle zone\", Jimin being eliminated is a blessing in disguise. The luck starts with Kerrigan May being sick, so no one keeps her in check to smuggle things and kidnap Xitsuh (men's alliances too strong, they hurdle with themselves. yurisa-mina naturally being a team cz of that.) Her not surviving the main match and death match is unexpectedly the best outcome possible for the strat that YunB prepared. If she survives and the ambush mission happened, it would be 50:50 (even lower for the jungle team), as Knucks and the mansion team would not be swayed that easily.!&lt;\n\nOn the kidnapping part:\n\n&gt;!At the start, it's kinda weird that Xitsuh and YunB are easily obeyed the jungle team's request. But looking how Korean variety show works, their obedience kinda make sense. For 24-hour variety show filming like this, there would be bound to be secret/midnight/hidden mission for all/select players. So that's why they thought they hit the jackpot or something.!&lt;\n\nYurisa!\n\n&gt;!After watching Yurisa's playstyle, I think she's just perfect for The Genius, but her fate might be similar to Nam Hweejong lmao. !&lt;\n\nAnyway, this season might be the vision that PD had from the first one, and I would gladly watch it till the end",

I can clearly see she is a introvert. Everyone is different in how they play the game. I am excited to see how she does in the next episodes.",

            "comment": "It was my first time tearing up to see someone go (Jimin). But honestly her death match performance was bad. Like I was so confused as to why she use her turns to reveal useful infos for the opponent and even dared called it a strategy. Even if she's not in her optimal state that was... then Yurisa said the same thing in her interview cut and I knew immediately Jimin is dead since  ofc Yurisa caught on.\n\nWhen she said she wanted 'her oppas' to 'kill' the inside members for her I choked a bit. It was both endearing and sad. \n\nYurisa is also something else.. She truly is a MENSA member for she reminds me of Choi Jungmoon in zombie game of The Genius S1, not her brain, her actions.... her tone.. the way she makes me want to lock myself away from her. I see a lot of other viewers like her to no surprise. I don't hate her, I just find it hard to watch her without cringing. \nWhile I do agree with the player who comments about her complete disregard of human psychology in her play, that's just her flaw to fix which idc about. what really bothers me is the \"ah it's my day/my control\" written all over her face that just makes me cringe. I remember Lee Sangmin noticing that of Choi Jungmoon almost immediately when she drawed lots as a zombie. Yurisa REEKS of that. \n\nThere weren't a lot of chances for them to shine. But I also notice player Lee Jinhyung amongst the outdoor team. He shouldn't be underestimated. Artepoker also have a good head on his shoulders but he's currently too lukewarm in attitude. If he can be more assertive he would make a strong player.\n\nI kinda want to focus on the game since everybody's else is talking about.. that. It's kinda disgusting how the prouction team is trying to profit off it (since the teasers). And I kinda don't wanna give them attention even if our discussions here are not 'legal' nor matters.",

Yurisa is already my all time favorite player in any game show ever since Hong Jin Ho in Season 1. She is extremely clever and absolutely fearless with insane mentality. I hope and I know she will fight against all odds and win\n\nBloody Game 2 is also probably one of my all time favorite game show. The format is so creative and the games are beautifully designed. HOWEVER, I'm absolutely disgusted by how the production team handle the everything . This is way across the line. The act of breaking the glass in dark is very dangerous let alone other things, like walking downstairs without lights.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm even more disgusted by Ha Seungjin. His motives and acts are pure embarrassing and disgraceful. And if this show was still filming, I wouldn't surprise viewers demand expelling him from the show",

The way she calmly and curtly threatened the guys that they'd be following Xitsuh into oblivion was LOL. In a way, her threat kind of came true, with most of them ending up in the jungle.\n\nIt's too bad that she comes off abrasive to a lot of the other contestants, making them suspect her and more eager to oust her.\n\nI hope she comes back from the basement and ruins them all \\*evil cackle\\*\n\nIn the past, I've been partial to Park Jimin. But before her face-off with Yurisa, Jimin said she was baffled that Yurisa named her as a candidate for the elimination game when there was clearly an alliance of men running things.\n\nBut Jimin, herself, was targeting Yurisa before that! Park Jimin has a habit of making all kinds of self-serving plays and then complaining when others act according to her own standards. At that point, I was just tired of that aspect of Jimin, and it was satisfying to see Yurisa win.\n\nYou could argue that Jimin was reacting to Yurisa aggressively checking Jimin earlier on. But I'm not sure who started it \"first\" or is to \"blame\" for the antagonistic energy between them. Jimin was conniving - albeit, as required by the game - against Yurisa and all the rest of the mansion team from the get go.",

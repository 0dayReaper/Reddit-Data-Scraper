    "postText": "Source: [Soompi article](https://www.soompi.com/article/1575348wpp/shin-dong-yup-and-han-chae-ah-to-host-new-19-reality-talk-show)\n\nComedian Shin Dong Yup and actress Han Chae Ah are gearing up to host a brand new 19+ reality talk show that will explore marriage and healthy relationships in an unconventional way!\n\n\u201cResting Couple\u201d (literal translation) is a reality talk show that will provide solutions for married couples who are currently in sexless relationships due to various social or personal reasons. But rather than simply focusing on physical intimacy, the show will aim to restore these couples\u2019 happy and healthy marriages through a journey of finding ways to understand each other\u2019s minds and hearts.\n\nShin Dong Yup and Han Chae Ah will be the MCs on \u201cResting Couple,\u201d acting as a bridge between the talk show\u2019s couples and the viewers who will listen to their stories. It\u2019s expected that the two will share real stories from their own marriages as well as tips for the couples coming face-to-face with hurdles in their relationships. A group of professionals will also be providing couples with everything needed to ease their worries and help their relationships, from medical advice to workshops and individualized assignments for each couple to work on.\n\nThe show will feature four couples who are all experiencing the same worries but for different reasons, creating a space to delve into a deeper conversation about marriage. They will participate in the \u201cResting Couple Workshop\u201d and be given the opportunity to share stories that they haven\u2019t even told their own spouses through conversations held between the husbands and wives separately.\n\nThe show\u2019s production team stated, \u201cPlease look forward to \u2018Resting Couple,\u2019 which will boldly reveal a story that most couples worry about but can\u2019t bring up and introduce a very heavy talking point in the relationships of Korean married couples.\u201d\n\n\u201cResting Couple\u201d is scheduled to premiere in May.",

No one really talks about these kinds of things so it's nice to have a public space for it. There's also been a growth of a casual dating culture (i.e fwb relationships, casual dating, hookup apps) as seen by popular shows like Nevertheless and other k-reality shows, so it's important to have popular physical and emotional sexual education.",

He also has a younger brother who is disabled, and he's been open about the struggles his family faced and the resources people can donate to to help the cause. \n\nHe's worked his ass off in the industry, from being an extra on shows, to slowly getting comedy roles on sitcoms, to hosting events, to SNL, and more, and I'm just so inspired by him.",

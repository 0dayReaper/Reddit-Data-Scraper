Like when the PDs come up with another music project and leave the two of them on the sidelines and people question what the two of them are even on the show for. The cast was fine imo. Bong Sun is terrific and while I agree Jun Ha has been quite reserved on the show, he's shown glimpses where he can be hilarious given the opportunity. He was one of my faves on IC. He can be funny. You could argue that perhaps Jun Ha wasn't a good fit with the cast members. Hope they can move on to better things.",

Maybe if a particular project or episode gets a lot of praise then I'll check it out, but with this, even knowing about the dismissal beforehand, I've lost faith in the show and no longer feel the need to keep up with it every Sat/Sun. Not putting blame on the members much, and especially not on Bongsun who was easily the best of a lot of their recent bad eps, but watching a show meant to entertain shouldn't be something I dread to do.",

When he appeared on HDYP, I quickly started to like him just like the show changed my mind about Myung Soo with the chicken episodes. \n\nI feel like he got the short end of the stick. With the police episodes, he was kept in the room to ad-lib alone while others not only got a whole breakfast scenario going without him but also got to team up and bounce off each other. Meanwhile he gets to play with the kidnappers for half a minute then he's alone trying to piece together shredded paper, I'm sorry but even YJS won't be able to make that fun.\n\nThen there was the episode where again they get to go around and look for a building and interact with citizens while he has to sit down in one spot and do a jigsaw puzzle. Like how is he supposed to get screen time from that?\n\nI recently realized the PD gets a lot of flak which I thought was odd because I really enjoyed all episodes with him in charge even his inclusion in front of the camera which I know ppl didn't like. That said, Jun Ha getting axed leaves a bad taste in my mouth with this PD. Not to mention the setup of last episode, embarrassing unknowing citizens with the calendar sale, Mijoo/Jun Ha's seller was having none of it, didn't even consent to their face being revealed.",

I know the show coupled Yi-kyung n Mi-joo a lot but I actually found the coupling of Yi-kyung n Bong-sun funnier ex.: I found Bong-sun n Yi-kyung's Troublemaker dance one of the funniest moment of the casts. \n\nanyway decision has been made, i hope if SBS is gonna reboot X-man soon, Shin Bong-sun n Haha be assigned as the two team leaders.",

Bong Sun was an unfortunate casualty of the PD\u2019s incompetence, but it feels like this is definitely HDYP\u2019s last chance. If they don\u2019t turn things around, there\u2019s a high chance the show gets cancelled soon anyway. Also even though it\u2019s unfortunate, the show just had too many people. Maybe they could have tried changing the PDs without removing any cast members, but they missed the window to do that. I don\u2019t think a slump can be reversed without change, and tbh it might be too little too late. But I could be wrong.",

As a middle child, I occasionally feel bad for Soul but it's nice that both parents acknowledge that they have biases over the eldest and the youngest so they make sure to take care of Soul the best they can. But nobody can make me eat that &gt;!poop cake!&lt;, it looks so real it makes me lose appetite loool",

Wait till she\u2019s old enough to go bungee jumping or the Nevis Swing!\n\nGlad Dream summoned courage and gave it a shot albeit with his eyes closed the whole time. Hopefully Soul can try again the next time.",

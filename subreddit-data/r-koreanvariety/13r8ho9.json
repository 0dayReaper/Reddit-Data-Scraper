And then later we met his friends who brought photos and led everyone down a tear-laced memory lane.\n\nThere were some cute moments though; Song being so sweet to Lee Yi Kyung over the phone, \u201cDid you remember we had ice cream?\u201d and that dramatic faint from having her first taste of crab bibimbap.",

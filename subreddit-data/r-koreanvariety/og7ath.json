    "postText": "I know that watching Kim Jong Kook working out might not be to everyone's liking but it seems like the channel is going to be a lot more than that.\n\nThis week, he's got Song Jihyo guesting and it seems like his guest segments are going to be a mixture of talk and advice, with some practical stuff to follow.\n\nI'm really surprised that he's chosen to have his first guest feature not only a female and be centered around female workouts but that he actually managed to convince notoriously social media shy Song Jihyo to participate.\n\nI highly recommend watching because you can see how close they genuinely are away from the set of Running Man and see a somewhat different side to Song Jihyo that we don't often get to see. \n\nAs a fan of both, (not a shipper, I just appreciate the work they do), I couldn't stop smiling the whole way through.\n\n[Watch the video here](https://youtu.be/83InZHaHrTg) (English subtitles are available).",

Either way I hope the other RM members get to appear in the future. \n\nBased on this and next episode, a format where a guest comes and consult with KJK while eating or hanging out before a workout session seems simple but effective for an online show. Personal trainer KJK can always elicit funny reactions (usually of pain and regret) from whichever poor soul he's training. I'm looking forward to more lol.",

I think Jang Hyuk and Cha Tae Hyun would provide a hilarious contrast, lol",

They also talked about how close they are. Sadly the video was removed on YT and I can't find it anywhere else.",

Even on Running Man you notice it often if you watched all episodes.\n\nPoor KJK have a hard time ahead trying to get Jihyo into shape :D\nEspecially since she loves alcohol which is the worst offender there is lol :D\n\n\nI would love if KJK did a collab with Boss Yang. That would be one epic video:D",

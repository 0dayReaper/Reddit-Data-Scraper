    "postText": "**Description of the Show:**\n\nIn each episode, the cast members, together with a guest (known as the Sixth Man), visit three different places (or people) of hot issue. One of the three is entirely fabricated from scratch by the production team, and the cast members and the Sixth Man have to figure out which one is entirely fabricated, by using their \"sixth senses\" to analyze every detail of the three.\n\nFor Season 2, the correct voters receive 1 gold persimmon each as a prize, and the cast member with the greatest number of correct answers at the end of the season will win a grand prize.It appears there is no penalty for the member that guesses incorrectly, unlike Season 1 with one person having no eyebrows for the next episode's introduction or a picture uploaded to social media showing the penalty.\n\n**Cast:**\n\n* Yoo Jae-suk\n* Oh Na-ra\n* Jeon So-min\n* Jessi\n* Mijoo (Lovelyz)\n* Lee Sang-yeob\n* Guest - On Joo-wan\n\n**RAW** :\n\n* [Sixth Sense S02E01.210625.720p-NEXT Torrent &amp; Magnet Links](https://torrentube.net/kt/read?p=umxjsQGFlG&amp;se=1)\n* 720p Magnet ---&gt; magnet:?xt=urn:btih:cc7b95643fe9469d0d5af3b9d93a27a6790162a9\n* [Sixth Sense S02E01.210625.1080p-Deresisi Torrent &amp; Magnet Links](https://torrentube.net/kt/read?p=zhb7vDTLtq&amp;se=1)\n* 1080p Magnet ---&gt; magnet:?xt=urn:btih:49b73fb6b73902124b9a320421b29178c44e48bb\n* [720p-NEXT Mega (This will be active for a couple weeks before I remove it off my account)](https://mega.nz/file/VdkXECzb#liDcp_SKc9DiqXGRUk6Lga97H0bbfD-s6sr0drGqB2Y)\n\n**Subtitle** :\n\n* [ZippyShare (Sixth Sense S02E01 720p-NEXT Subtitles)](https://www9.zippyshare.com/v/0e4Zijmw/file.html)\n* [Smash (Sixth Sense S02E01 720p-NEXT Subtitles)](https://fromsmash.com/Sixth-Sense-Season-2-E0110625-720p-NEXT-Subtitles)\\*Thanks to badstewie, the subtitles linked need to be delayed 15 seconds for Deresisi version\n\n\\*[Reddit's \"Shows of the Week\" Post - Week 26](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/wiki/shows_of_the_week_2021/week_26#wiki_friday_.2821.06.25.29)",

I can continue doing it weekly for everyone, unless someone else wants to...I don't mind since I did it last season &amp; for other shows here.\n\nAlso, I download the 720p-NEXT versions usually and the subtitles are usually synced to that one. Post will be updated once a subtitle is released and linked.  \nIf people want the subtitle uploaded to ZippyShare &amp; Smash, I can do that too since I know some members can't access certain sites, so just let me know.  \nIf a subtitle has to be resynced (I hope I won't have to for this show), I will retime it to the NEXT version since that's what I save for my personal collection. I have to resync subtitles often for \"How Do You Play\" and I share them with everyone. Usually Deresisi versions don't sync to subtitles for NEXT, from what I've read off other posts.",

I also loved her reaction to being picked out of all of them in the van. The camera work catching the girls' faces during the games was great, especially Mi-joo &amp; So-min when asking about combining YJK and Jessi. \n\nApparently, the spoiler thing doesn't work on notifications, so I saw the answer before watching the episode...something I didn't know. Have to ignore the notification icon before watching the episode, and just go to the post. I'm not sure if I would have guessed it right.",

    "postText": "From allkpop \n\nOn October 7, the Seoul Western District Prosecutor's Office indicted Park Soo Hong's older brother, Park Jin Hong, on charges of embezzlement under the Act on Aggravated Punishment on Specific Economic Crimes and also indicted his brother's wife, Lee, without detention.\n\nPark Jin Hong is accused of extorting 6.17 billion KRW (4.3 million USD), including company funds and Park Soo Hong's personal funds, while setting up an entertainment agency from 2011 to 2021\n\nPark Jin Hong is accused of embezzling 1.9 billion KRW (1.34 million USD) from the company through false accounting of labor costs and using 1.17 billion KRW (824,000 USD) to purchase a building. He also misappropriated 180 million KRW (127,000 USD) of company funds in other ways, such as credit card payments.\n\nDuring investigations, it was also found that Park Jin Hong had withdrawn 2.9 billion KRW (2 million USD) from Park Soo Hong's personal bank account without permission.\nPark Soo Hong's father claimed that he had managed Park Soo Hong's personal funds during the prosecution investigation. However, the prosecution determined that Park Jin Hong had stolen 2.9 billion KRW from Park Soo Hong while managing his brother's money",

His mom and him were on the show My Ugly Duckling where single male celebrities and their moms talk about why the son is still single and usually try to set them up on blind dates... His mom liked being on TV so both of them would get paid and the brother could embezzle more money... Think the brother took 70% and PSH only got 30% ( was supposed to be the other way around but PSH never checked)",

This is an encouraging result that would hopefully hold out until the legal end in a positive way for Park Soohong. \n\nThis case has been heart-wrenching since the first time I've heard about it. You've got someone who has worked hard sincerely since he's young for his parents &amp; siblings getting back-stabbed by the very own sibling(s) &amp; parent(s). I wish Park Soohong the best in his recovery ahead. He shouldn't blame his trusting heart in past; the lack of integrity in his brother &amp; SIL's hearts are their own faults &amp; not Park Soohong's. He just needs to trust but verify moving forward.",

I guess it helped that his dad basically outed to the media and said that PSH and his brother were 50/50 on everything including property but PSH's name was not in any of the papers. So he really believed in his older son. Trusting in his lies and deception about the split of assets when legally on paper that is not the case. The older brother is truly despicable because he had the parents believing that everything was split fairly. The father is a sad excuse of a father to choose sides and I hope he regrets it now that the courts have spoken. For a second there, I thought they would get away with this. Although, the sister-in-law is charged without detention? Does that mean she isn't going to be arrested? \n\nIt sucks about the insurance policies though. Can he change the beneficiary/person receiving it if anything happened to him. Like instead of his brother and his kids getting the insurance money, he can change it to his wife, no? I hope they allow him to do that. He better be under police protection because I feel like their last resort would be to hurt him since the insurance policies can't be cancelled for fraud.",

Maybe he doesn't want to pay such a high price for multiple insurance policies. From what I read, his brother took out a lot of insurance policies for him and that is sure to affect his own bills because he would need to pay for it with his own money if he can't cancel them. Remember the brother has been stealing from him for over 10 years. He lost money and he can only get that money back after the brother pays him back if the brother even pays him, who knows how much money he has moved or hidden. That's probably why PSH tried to fight to cancel the insurance policies as well because he will still be responsible to pay for it since it is under his name.",

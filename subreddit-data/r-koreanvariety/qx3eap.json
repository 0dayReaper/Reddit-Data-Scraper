    "postText": "As a bodybuilder myself who loves Running Man. My most un-biased opinion is that Greg Doucette didn't research how accusations like these can ruin and destroy someone's life in a culture and society like South Korea.\n\n\nHe should've done his due diligence and researched about the South Korean media culture first before making accusations even if Freedom of Speech is promoted in his country.\n\nThe accusations he is making is cross-border which sure doesn't \"limit\" his Freedom of Speech but also doesn't provide him with unlimited accusations in the world. You get what I mean.",

KJK announced earlier today or yesterday he will be taking legal action to everyone who tries to defame him (likely him removing the videos was a result of it). Bc of how he even made a second video on the matter, I dont think Greg did it because he regretted his commentary/did it bc it was the \"right thing\", rather he was scared of legal action...",

Read your own comment.\n\nObviously the right way is to sue Greg in his own country. Is it possible? Yeah. Will he win? Probably, you not a Canadian judge who will decide the case.\n\nYou ask for my opinion which I did gave. Canadian libel &amp; slander didn't require the plaintiff to proof that the defendant cause real damage. You can ask any Canadian lawyer if you still not satisfy with my comment. Yeah Greg can sue anyone if he want. Obviously he need to cover all the initial cost. I made several comments on his YouTube video. Hopefully he will pick me. Lol\n\nJust calm your tits. I didn't attack you. I'm merely responding to yr request asking for my opinion.\n\nI think I waste my time responding to yr comment. For second time, the fact that Greg already apologized show that he know there is a huge possibility that he may face potential lawsuit from kjk. You don't agree? Just like Greg, I don't care.

I have always respected KJK for his work ethic (but I am neither a fan or an anti) im totally new to the controversy but it seems like people are more worried about his career than about the truth. Since the truth is not out, I feel like blame shouldn't be placed on Greg. The person that exposes something falsely will pay the price eventually but we do not know yet if Greg is wrong or right. As far as I know Greg stated his case from a logical standpoint. If someone saw his video and feels different, please prove me wrong. Let's find the truth first. If indeed KJK took drugs knowing the repercussions of it for a citizen let alone a celebrity in Korea, that's on him not on Greg. And I believe the public deserves to know the truth.",

I think it's basic courtesy that if you're a public figure, like Greg, then you have to be mindful with what you say about something because your words are broadcast to your large audience. This is made worse because he's willing to make an accusation without having enough information, and he's reluctant to make necessary clarification. \n\n\nThis whole thing wouldn't have happened if Greg was being more mindful with his position to begin with, and the escalation could've been easily avoided if he was willing to clarify his position.",

His testosterone levels are on the high end but still in the normal range and not really one in a million.  Greg also only brought that up in his last video because there wasn\u2019t clear evidence that he was using hormones. If there was, I doubt Greg would have changed his tune from he\u2019s definitely on TRT to KJK shouldn\u2019t mislead his viewers.\n\nTo me, the large volume issue seems overblown.  It seems like KJK just uses a lot of warm up sets.  He always starts from very light weight, like 40 kg on incline bench, until his top set and that takes more sets for him at his level of experience. \n\nAs a fan of KJK you would know that he has always been very athletic and has good cardiovascular strength and can take short periods of rest, as he mentions often, in comparison to the stereotypical bodybuilder or powerlifter who doesn\u2019t do cardio. 50 sets in 2 hours seems doable to me.\n\nAlso, KJK doesn\u2019t promote the amount of volume he does, they\u2019re workout vlogs I would equate more to mukbangs people watch vicariously. He\u2019s just showing HIS routine. \n\nRather, in his videos for \u201cnoobs\u201d, he advocates proper form and only as much as you can handle.\n\nGoing by all that, I couldn\u2019t say that Greg made his videos in the interest of the fitness industry.\n\nAll together, I see it as a conflict of perspective.  Greg and other people who say he\u2019s not natural only view from their experiences and can\u2019t see the rest of the circumstances. I can always be wrong and he is not natural. However, knowing KJK\u2019s full story leads me and it seems most of the Korean general public to err on the side that he is natural.\n\nSorry for the long text.",

You can argue whatever the guys intention was, whether he wanted to \"raise awareness in the fitness industry\" or whatever noble goals. Maybe there was no intention in accusing KJK, he thought he was just sharing his opinion/reviewing on KJK. This might get him a lighter sentence compared to someone with real intent to defame him.\n\nBut the intention doesn't change the result. The problem here is not that he thinks KJK is on HRT/TRT. He is free to think whatever he wants. But the problem is he CHOSE to post his opinion on his YT video and garnered 300K+ views. He also presented his 'opinions' in an accusatory tone initially, as somebody has already mentioned. It wasn't reviewed in an objective manner, giving KJK the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThis then caught the attention of the SK media, blowing things up, ultimately harming KJK's reputation. I think the SK media has some responsibility too, but ultimately it's the guy that posted his opinions to his 1M subscribers, ignorant of the cultural difference and the harm it could bring to a celeb in SK. I don't think ignorance will hold up in court.\n\n\nMaybe he is right and it's SUPER rare that one can have KJK physique at 45, and 99 out of 100 people take supplements. But making baseless opinion videos like this with the intention to spread online, he can be right 99 times out of 100. Great, nothing happens (though KJK's lawyer said that one can still be sued for defamation in SK even if it's true). \n\nHowever the 1 time he's wrong, and esp against a SK celebrity, he should be held accountable for his words and action of mass disseminating false information. Especially when the celebrity in question built his career and 10+ years variety personality as a passionate, all-hard-work and natural fitness guy.",

In reality Greg Doucette called him out and said those exact words that could ruin a person's career. This isn't some petty crap. If the tables were turned and KJK said something that could ruin some other public figure's career then their fans would step up for that person as well. \n\nWe're not reacting this way because somebody made fun of some kpop singer, or someone said that girl group has no talent, or some boy group's fanbase are annoying teenagers. Greg Doucette is accusing a form of fraud and it's personal. No one told Greg to say any of this. He choose to say this and release it on the internet. KJK was just minding his own business and he has no fault in this.\n\nIn reality, it doesn't matter if it's KJK. Whether it's free speech or not, if you want to accuse somebody of anything and it's false then be ready to take responsibility because not everybody is going to stay quiet.",

Yes, you're free to shout \"fire, fire\" in a crowded theater but when there's no fire and the resultant stampede harms and/or kills attendees, then you must face the consequences of that.\n\nYes, everyone is entitled to their opinion. But the one giving the opinion must also understand that said opinion can be construed as defamation if it infringes on the target's rights and/or livelihood.

But his content in the past year has been so stale and always about attacking other people about their natty status. And what rubs me the wrong way is that he never apologizes to anyone, and when he's wrong and tries to backtrack he tries to twist it in a way where hes still in the right. He found out there really isn't much that his channel can give anymore compared to more science related ones and thats why he has to rely on making shitty natty or not content. Like we get it dude there are people who take peds and it shouldn't be a standard for the regular person but you don't need to reiterate it 2 times a week.\n\nEdit: also kjk channel main purpose wasn't to teach people about fitness, but its for his fans that constantly ask him how he works out and what his training routine looks like.",

Then again I'm not Korean so I'm not sure how they view steroids and such so my opinion isn't worth much",

He doesn't need to publicly apologize for giving his opinion. It's not like he even said anything horrible about him.\n\nLet's be honest, he was likely right about KJK being on HRT. This is KJK using SK's ridiculous defamation laws (hell it counts as defamation even if you are knowingly tell the truth which is fucking absurd). A big part of him making the videos private is likely because some of KJK's fans are hypocrites who yell about people being mean to him (which Doucette wasn't, he never actually insulted KJK since he doesn't think taking HRT makes you a bad person and doesn't change the fact that you still have to work hard) but then harass people online into doing what they want.",

Why do you say he is likely?? KJK has been working out for 20 years to achieve that body huh. He pnly changed his statement that it is not a bad thing after KJK proven the tests and people go after him. Isn\u2019t he the first one who started this?

I personally place more blame on the media outlets that twisted his words to make this such a big deal - if this was limited to Greg's channel, no one would've batted an eye.

For Kim Jong Kook the guy have been working out from a young age and never stops, he is a master of that.\n\nHe shouldn't be compared to others also there is an ep of mom dairy where he tested his testosterone level which was very high.\n\nThe article you posted didn't say what you said about needing steroids and working out won't work!! But mentioned ways to preserve and reduce muscle loss while aging and suggested working out routine! hmmmm",

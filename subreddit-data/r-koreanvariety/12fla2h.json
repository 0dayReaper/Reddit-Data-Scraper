I believe this was around the time that Haha's daughter had a health emergency, and maybe YJS thought it would help him to have another source of income. Junha had nothing else going on so this show helps him earn money, and SBS has also benefitted a lot from this program.

If you replace Jae Seok with pretty much 99% of comedians (Truthfully, I only say 99 because 100 is too absolute, but I can't think of any comedian that could replace him and have the same level of success), then \"Yu San Seul\" and \"SSAK3\" most likely flop. Even if he is a mediocre singer, he always puts 100% effort in, his connections throughout the entire entertainment industry are insane and he is loved by the nation.\n\nIt was obvious the national snack competition was going to be a repeated concept, but people aren't okay with it having 2 episodes (2.5 so far) while they were okay with having 4 episodes of Jae Seok learning how to cook instant ramyeon or 5 episodes of Jae Seok learning how to cook fried chicken (Which turned out ok since 4/6 Infinite Challenge members reunited at the end).\n\nAs for the 2nd episode of the school, there were mini variety projects with 3 episodes of variety investors starting at 75 and rehashing Star Survival starting in episode 80.\n\nAs for the fixed cast, in episode 103 Jae Seok said outright that he attempted to bring back all members of Infinite Challenge, but Myung Soo, Hyung Don, and Hong Chul all had their own things they want to focus on.\n\n'Funny' isn't the only measurement of entertainment. H&amp;H and Dangeun aren't exactly designed to be funny. Even episode 5 was entertaining and it was mostly just educational.",

If you take a look at the episode list of 2022-2023, the number of \u201cnew\u201d things they\u2019ve tried is very very little and it just comes off as lazy most of the time. I think the potential success of music projects has kind of run its course and HDYP is definitely a hard show to plan for, but it would be nice if it felt like there was actual effort being put into planning.",

All in 120 episodes.\n\nChang Hoon: Meeting with Hyungs, MBTI, Meeting with Noonas, Teacher Yoo Bong Du, Slaves, JMT, Temp Agency, Get Members in Van, Snack, Winter MT, Investigation team, Restoration shop, 2/3 music projects (WSG Wannabe + Throwaway ent \\[JooJoo Secret + One Top\\]) in 60 episodes. (Note I only counted concepts that have multiple episodes. There are a bunch of one-offs).\n\nDepending on what you consider repetition versus a series of a single concept, the 2 are pretty equal despite Chang Hoon only being main PD for half the amount of episodes (I'm also questioning if Chang Hoon had more responsibility over Refund Sisters since he was there more often than Tae Ho). Well over half of Tae Ho's 120 episodes were music projects which focus on Jae Seok's connections in the industry and the performers themselves rather than the production team.\n\nBack to my initial point, the difference is focusing on series versus trying out sporadic variety. Is it 'repeating' a concept if it drags for multiple episodes? Does it only count as repeating if you split it up even though it was meant to be an ongoing concept?",

It\u2019s different when the recurring segments are literally not entertaining. Do we really wanna see them jump rope, investigate, or search for things in cars again? Sure the number of concepts may be similar, but there is definitely a difference in how original it feels watching it. His weakness is not only in planning concepts but the poor execution and pacing. It feels like he has literally no sense of what viewers would like seeing. Out of all the projects listed, only a handful were actually enjoyable, like the Noonas concept and this past Throwaway Ent one. Maybe I\u2019m being harsh and I don\u2019t mean to overly praise KTH\u2019s time because it definitely had its weaknesses, but it isn\u2019t good when many viewers can feel the incompetency of the production team. Of course it\u2019s all subjective, but the amount of people having the same feeling has to indicate there\u2019s something wrong. This is also a cumulative reaction, not specific to this episode or the next because I actually found this episode fine, it\u2019s just not fun to see previews and not really feel excited at all.",

I am strictly talking about what you are crediting/blaming on the production team versus your own personal tastes.\n\nYou complained about repetition and I proved that even Tae Ho has repetition (Drastically). The main issue seems to be you currently dislike the concepts that are 'repeating' and blame it on the production team. Jump rope happened twice, technically a 3rd because the members argued for it. Searching in the car happened twice because the members asked for a rematch after they failed the first time.\n\nThere have been two investigation role plays and there will most likely be a third considering the two teams are 1-1. Out of all projects done on HDYP, having a city-wide role play set up for the cast is probably the heaviest involvement from the production team. Also this is most likely a theme that Jae Seok advocates for since he loves role play (Busted! and The Zone). \\[Funnily enough, 1 of Tae Ho's major music projects has more episodes than these 3 concepts combined.\\]\n\nI'm going to be honest and I'm going to assume it doesn't have anything to do with the editing / pacing, but the cast. People were ok with seeing Jae Seok hang out with Hyori and Rain doing anything and it will be fine (13-15 episodes). People were ok with seeing Jae Seok hangout with Jong Min, Jae Hyung, Hyori, Jung Hwa, Jessi, and Hwasa do anything (13 episodes). Truthfully, none of Tae Ho's long-term projects were enhanced by editing or the production team (IMO). The only episodes with controlled editing and pacing are the cam relay episodes. Everything else was reliant on the on-screen talent.\n\nTruthfully, WSG Wannabe / Throwaway Ent weren't any different than the first 4 major music projects in terms of editing and what was shown except for who was actually performing, but somehow everything the new PD does is bad because his name isn't Tae Ho.\n\nTLDR: I'm not even trying to argue what the new PD does is good or bad, people are just so desperate to place blame somewhere for not liking an episode.",

Honestly don't care about love lines but his and Jinjoo is actually kinda entertaining because they don't take it too seriously. The weird drizzle analogy kinda worked too because even I found myself giggling at some pf his flirting attempts. Whereas the attempted love line with Mijoo, where she straight up rejects him, is expected, it doesn't work as well since any repeated attempts feel iffy but here, it feels harmless enough. Also liked Jae Suk scolding Byungjae for his Hyunmoo likeness and feeling left out of the '88 moments. \n\nEating eps are usually Junha's specialty and here he does provide some interesting info but his team with Mina, Haha, and Mijoo def feels like the B team since they don't gel well. Gonna be brutally honest and say Mijoo doesn't actually mesh that well with half of the team. She's obv great with Jaesuk, which is the main thing, and she works well enough with Haha and Jinjoo but with Yikyung (the love line here feels forced), Mina, and Junha, she feels awkward. It's not entirely on her since Yikyung, Mina, and Junha are also not trying particularly hard to match her but as a result, there's a disjointed feeling present whenever they do team ups that involve her without Jaesuk. \n\nThe show temporarily adding Byungjae was a fantastic addition for this ep specifically and while I understand just adding members isn't a great solution, I can't help but wish they did add another to even out the team and help with some of the missing chemistry. If they do (which is unlikely, but a girl can dream), then I'm hoping for somebody who's not a comedian or an actor since there's already a lot of them in the current cast, but an entertainer/tv personality who often has to work with huge teams.\n\nAlso next ep looks kinda awkward since you're putting so many variety newbies into skits but it could also be glorious...I hope.",

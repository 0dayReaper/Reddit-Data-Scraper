Maybe it's due to them being older? Idk but it wasn't it. \n\nOverall a boring episode that I couldn't finish. Thought that they would introduce something interesting next week but it's a part 2 of the same thing lol.",

The humour should naturally flow from the situation they are in not forced out of the members because you didn't adequately set up decent tasks for them to carry out.\n\nImagine being at risk of being replaced as a cast member because you couldn't make the 60th food related mundane task entertaining.",

She often play that role with Somin which display more light and chill act. While on the other hand, she also like to play being uptight strict boomer when there's younger guest.",

The fact that they hinted towards it makes me wonder if the show will proceed as usual with the cast or not, since there\u2019s been no reference to it since the articles came out and everyone\u2019s been acting as usual.",

I thought Sung Mi would support someone like Mijoo who isn\u2019t the typical idol to be a variety star. Then to adore YiKyung and trying to introduce her daughter who is 9 years younger is meh. Then to tease JaeSuk that he only gave $10 then $20 to her kids back when he was \u201cpoor\u201d and later got JaeSuk to pay $100 for her kids now. It\u2019s a really forced gag that isn\u2019t really funny?",

(i guess i may also be feeling extra protective of mijoo since lately shes gotten a lot of backlash due to the production team\u2019s decisions, which is sad to see)\n\ni know the production team can\u2019t really predict how a guest is going to treat members of the cast but i do think sungmi was a very poor choice of a guest. i understand she is successful and considered a legend but. god she really made this episode so uncomfortable to watch\u2026",

Plus, LSG was tapped for Peak Time and several dramas.  \n\nI will miss MITH.  I have watched from the first season first episode and have learned quite a lot from all the episodes.  The variety of topics were far and wide. \n\nI wish all the MITH members all the best in the future.",

It was nice to see some fresh new faces. \n\nHopefully the cast gets to do other ventures. I know BamBam's doing his YT show and Donghyun is sometimes on TROS but still, it's kinda disappointing to see long term variety shows end.",

Idols are also heavily controlled by their agencies in what they can and cannot do. I'm curious why PDs take that sort of risk.  I'm assuming they're hoping the fans will help the show succeed but I've never seen that actually work out unless the idol is already good at variety. If anyone knows the reasoning, I'd be glad to know.",

                    "comment": "&gt;I always wonder why PDs cast idols, particularly when said idols haven't done official variety shows before.\n\nVariety PDs are always looking for new blood, variety gem, variety bluechip or whatever they want to call it. Idols happen to be a large renewing pool of new faces with variety potential.\n\n- Popularity of the Idol / group. The first thing would be that the show will be able to tap into an existing group of fans.\n\n- Good talking point for them to drum up publicity. Especially if the idol has never appearing in any variety shows before or never been regular cast member on a variety show before.\n\n- Appearance fees. A show's budget usually has to be splited between appearance fees and production fees. Casting new faces will be cheaper and will offset the fees for more seasoned variety veterans.\n\n- Scheduling will be easier for a variety new face. Idols that take on variety shows are usually on their break period a few years after debut or even past their 7th year contract. So their schedule is usually not as packed (but it also depends on who the Idol is). So it would be easier to schedule filming around rather than someone with 4-5 shows. Even someone like Kim Dong Hyun has 3-4 shows per week.\n\n- New chemistry between variety newbies and veterans can be discovered and built on rather than the same-old combinations.\n\n- Unexpected moments. Someone who is experienced in variety will also know all the tropes and gags so it may look fake or not be funny to the audiences anymore. A variety newbie will created unexpected moments which may be funny or interesting. Also while their agencies may have rules on what their idol can or cannot do, the idols themselves may not adhere to it all the time. Which creates more unexpected moments follwed by the idol saying \"ah, my agency / manager told me not to do that...\"",

Honestly nothing memorable from him but imo hes good enough for maknae+idol role in a large variety show (with 5+ members).\n\nI dont think theres a show with a member who has never done variety before. DY is a member in MITH since he was good in S1. A PD must have seen an idol in some show before casting him as a member.",

I feel like that what they always did. I mean, first things is too stabilize the show with veteran or professional first then leave 1-2 slot to play with it for fresh new face. If they just alright then good. If they can't perform well then after considerable time, they can say goodbye and the show gonna bring someone new.\n\nIt's just my impression, but like how Earth Arcade stabilize with Lee Eun Ji who's professional and Lee Young Ji fresh professional that on roll, then add Mimi and Yujin that bring great chemistry and each individual character shine.\n\nIf they can bring result like how Earth Arcade did, the show gonna get more attention and even going viral. It's win-win situation for both the show and the cast itself, after all, all of them got the benefit.",

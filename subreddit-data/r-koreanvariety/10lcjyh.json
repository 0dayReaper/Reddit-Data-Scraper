It\u2019s romance package! \n\nI stumbled across a dating show via antenna back in 2018 and can\u2019t seem to find it anywhere !hoping someone might have seen it too\n\nHere\u2019s form what I remember: it\u2019s a dating show that seemed to have taken place in a hotel. They would switch off pairings each date. The episode I saw (might have been the season finale) each person would chose who the wanted to be with and would knock on their room door. I believe the person could choose not to answer/ answer and turn them down. If they chose the person who came to knock on their door they would let them in. I know it\u2019s very vague but I\u2019ve been thinking about this show for years!! I Hope possibly someone has seen it too!",

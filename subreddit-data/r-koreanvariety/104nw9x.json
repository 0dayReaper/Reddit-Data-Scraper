    "postText": "# Description\n\n&gt; Love Catcher is a show featuring a group of men and women coming together for love or money. In this event, men and women who do not know each other will live in the same house. But before moving into the house, participants must choose between two identities: 'Love Catcher' or 'Money Catcher'. Later, 'Money Catcher' was seen forming sincere relationships with other 'Love Catchers'. On the other hand, 'Money Catcher' can win almost $50,000 if they can become a couple with 'Love Catcher' at the end of the show. When making romantic advances, there's an added mood of caution as participants can only guess who's there for love or money. \n\n# Panel\n\n* Jang Do Yeon\n* Joo Woo Jae\n* Jun Hyun Moo\n* Gabee\n* Kim Yo Han\n\n# Cast\n\nMale Participants\n* Park Yong Ho - [@hoho_dragon](https://www.instagram.com/hoho_dragon/)\n* Cho Seong Beom - [@laul_sb](https://www.instagram.com/laul_sb/)\n* Park Jung Hyun - [@junghyuniiii](https://www.instagram.com/junghyuniiii/)\n* Kim Yoon Soo Ro - [@kimyunsuro](https://www.instagram.com/kimyunsuro/)\n* Kwak Tae Hyeok - [@kwak_taehyeok](https://www.instagram.com/kwak_taehyeok/)\n\nFemale Participants\n* Kim Hyo Jin - [@h3_1o](https://www.instagram.com/h3_1o/)\n* Hwang Soo Ji - [@t_110771](https://www.instagram.com/t_110771/)\n* Lee Yu Jeong - [@ririyujeong](https://www.instagram.com/ririyujeong/)\n* Choi Tae Eun - [@c.taeeun](https://www.instagram.com/c.taeeun/)\n* Hong Seung Yeon - [@applemang0o](https://www.instagram.com/applemang0o/)\n\n\n# Episode Links\n\n|Info|Link|Notes|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|RAW|[Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1kG4y117jv/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click)||\n|Stream|[VIU](https://www.viu.com/ott/sg/en-us/vod/469269/Love-Catcher-in-Bali)|^(ENG SUB)|\n|Softsub|[Download](https://link.emediaarts.net/lovecatcherinbali/lcib-episode-7)|^(ENG SUB)|\n\n# Previous Discussions\n\n|Episode(s)|\n|:-:|\n|[01](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yyjiu2/love_catcher_in_bali_e01_221118/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [02](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z487z3/love_catcher_in_bali_e02_221125/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [03](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zafwqf/love_catcher_in_bali_e03_221202/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [04](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zn8wt2/love_catcher_in_bali_e04_221216/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)|\n|[05](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zta8sb/love_catcher_in_bali_e05_221223/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [06](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zyutpg/love_catcher_in_bali_e06_221230/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)|\n\n___\nTHE DISCUSSION BELOW MAY CONTAIN ***SPOILERS***",

It is unfortunate that Yu Jeong doesn't like him. \n\n- Sung Bum, if you are not a MC than what are you, really?\n\n- Tea Eun and Soo Ro's relationship is so worth the 50k. I especially love their councilling sessions with others.\n\n- it is obvious that the pressure is getting to Soo Ro and that he constantly second guesses himself around Tae Eun. I think he just likes her too much and is scared of getting hurt. I just hope that he wouldn't be pushed to choose MC for the fear of getting betrayed.\n\n- I should start taking notes from how Soo Ro rejects Seungyeon. It is always so gentle. I sure would have preferred if he didn't have to do it two times per episode tho.\n\n- Hyo Jin doesn't NEED to end up with anyone as long as she isn't MC. Same goes for everyone on there. Why the commenters act as if it is otherwise is beyond me.\n\n- Forget SB and YH, Soo Ji has the best relationship with Tae Eun. I adore their younger/older sister dynamic.",

She's kept doors open for both her interests in case she thought one was a MC. Also feels like a reveal as her being a MC would already boost an amazing season so far?",

And it\u2019s all very seamless.\n\nIt seemed like Taeeun was changing topics to talk about the food but it could just be edited and the scenes moved around just to make it more nerve-racking for us. \n\nJust like the last party dinner, I doubt Taeeun was biting her lips the wholeee time.. It was probably just edited in at crucial parts to make it seem like she\u2019s nervous about whatever they were talking about. That\u2019s why it\u2019s mostly solo shots so they can insert it anywhere they want.\n\nBut honestly I don\u2019t mind them trying to focus on the MC/LC talk as we are near the end.

You see JH targets HJ but he is also sure to keep YJ hopeful.\n\nSimilarly, my suspected HJ targets YH but she knows another guy (JH) is interested in her. It is just unfortunate in her point of view that JH is revealed to be MC. \n\nDie hard MCs in my opinion are usually more ambiguous and more strategic. Meaning they don\u2019t seem to be largely affected by their targets change of heart but are more forward looking in securing an LC, unless they are really invested and have the intention to change to LC. \n\nSB from the start has been fixated on SJ and only SJ. An MC most likely won\u2019t take that risk as there is no indication that SJ is a confirmed LC. If SB is an MC, he might consider that risk that SJ could be an MC as well. Since SJ has been showing tendencies to waver between YH and SB. However, SB advances seems to not waver hence that makes me certain SB is an LC.",

TE is always caring for the girls &amp; giving advice to the guys etc. I was surprised she's the first to go console YJ and not SY. SR is always considerate to SY and rejects her carefully while letting her keep her pride. They are the best! \n* When SR was advising HJ and saying JH picked MC before he met her, I wondered how he will feel when he finds out TE picked MC even after meeting him. Still keeping my fingers crossed for this couple! They really saved this season and the main reason I'm still watching!\n* I feel so sad &amp; frustrated with Yongho. Sooji just wants some clear affirmation from him. SB is cheesy but at least he is transparent. After the last party dinner, it looked like she was moved and wanted to give YH another chance. Yet he just gives up on his own and then feel sad about it. \n* No idea who's the last MC who called up YH for Secret Night. I thought its a girl because the person has a rather sharp jawline. JH calling up SJ for Secret Night is quite unexpected so it may not be HJ or SJ who spoke to YH. But what if it is a guy..\n* I've been looking at what they've been eating. besides the special occasions, they're snacking, eating burgers in cars, cooking instant food.. But Bali has so many cheap &amp; good food and delivery isn't uncommon. It's not like mealtime/cooking is a focus (like on Singles Inferno). No idea why they are restricted to the limited pantry in the kitchen.",

I think timing is quite important as seen by the choice of the invited participants between JH and TE.   \n\n\nJH who got to host Secret Night on Day 1 kinda have a random selection in SJ which eventually does not have any significant effect in his own love line (other than royally screwing up YH lol). That is prolly because it's still very early in the game so they haven't properly known the battlefield yet.\n\nWhile TE who got the chance on Day 5 invited SY which is a more focused choice and more related on her love line. After 5 days, clearly the lines have been more clearly drawn and it allows TE to use her Secret Night chance with a wiser choice.",

No one ever suspects JH for that.\n\nWith TE, it was not a wise move to call out SY for Secret Night. Because with the love triangle, SR knew for sure that was TE who called SY out, no one else has involved in that triangle. That is when he started to question her identity. If I was TE, with a MC mind, I would call someone else who is not related to my circle to avoid any suspicion. But TE has fallen in love with SR too and just want to mess with her love rival.

Don't forget to convert it to your time zone.\n\nSo right this moment that means about 16 hours from now.\n\nThis is similar to Netflix, Disney+, etc. when it comes to other (dating) shows. Like Single's Inferno (\uc194\ub85c\uc9c0\uc625), Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774), et cetera all released around that 3:00AM EST time or early morning.\n\nSome more info if you want to watch early with the machine translated English subtitles: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zyutpg/love_catcher_in_bali_e06_221230/j29fe39/",

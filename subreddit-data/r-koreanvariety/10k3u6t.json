    "postText": " \n\nA new Korean Reality show on Netflix just dropped showing 100 contestants in top physical shape competing in grueling physical fitness challenges for a large cash prize. It's kind of like Squid Game Meets survivor but some of the challenges featured here look similar to the ones on the Korean Reality show Singles Inferno (wrestling in a muddy pit for example).\n\nAlso I think both men and women are competing against each other. It should be really interesting.\n\nAnyways I don't really have anyone to talk to over at [r/Physical100](https://new.reddit.com/r/Physical100/) so if any of you are interested in talking about the first two episodes of this show, feel free to join me there!",

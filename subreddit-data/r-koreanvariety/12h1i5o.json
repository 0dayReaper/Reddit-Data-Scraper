    "postText": "A sex-postive talk show for the wild and curious. Follow Shin Dong-youp and Sung Si-kyung through Japan as they explore the uncharted territories of sex and sex experts. Premieres April 25th\n\nhttps://youtu.be/12QgESj4A1c\n\nHonestly, I'm really excited for this show! Once again, props to Shin Dong-youp for not being afraid to tackle taboo subjects. If I could, I would legit give him an award at this point. \n\nFrom the tone of the trailer, it seems very respectful, yet fun, which I enjoy. With a topic like this, it can be easy to make your show's tone inappropriate or demeaning to the sex workers, but both hosts seem open and welcoming. The juxtaposition between Japan, a country that is open to AV production and distribution, vs Korea that outright bans it will be really interesting to see. \n\nHowever, I'm a bit afraid about the public's response. It was only recently that a contestant from Peak Time was kicked out because he was friends with an JAV actress. The salty fan in me wishes this could have come out months ago so the backlash against him wouldn't have been as severe, but I hope the response to this show is much more understanding. Hopefully this program will be able to change at least some of the stigmas against sex workers.",

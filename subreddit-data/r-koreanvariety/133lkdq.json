            "comment": "7 trips sounds like a lot! It's not just the member's cost, each member requires a cameraman and then a couple of more camera people for the entire team and then PDs and writers and each member's PDs and their team of stylists and other personnel. Not to mention other crew members like sound guys and security. That's a lot of people who need transportation and places to stay and food. \n\nIt's good that they're starting with the cheapest trip (but I do hope they make major changes to the itinerary) and then moving their way up to JSJ's trip which is the first expensive trip and then KJK's which would be the most expensive and might not even be feasible. (Visa and shooting in US) \n\nSome notes from the episode:\n\n- SoMin looks absolutely incredible. It's so distracting. I hope that doesn't sound creepy. This is coming from a mostly straight female. \n\n- comment of the century: \n\n\"Oppa, why is your butt so big?\" \ud83d\ude02\n\n- As annoying as it is for her, I'd imagine, I just love how they won't let maknae SoMini breathe. Let the girl have some peace people. They all clearly felt bad for taking away her victory with KJK apologizing, them giving her another chance (not free, still) and even YSC who caused it all saying \"it's not our fault\". \n\n- Sukjin was on fire this whole episode. Definitely MVP with his tattoo idea, solo betraying everyone twice and then shamelessly making it about it being a beautiful heartfelt moment while Haha is complaining about \"how is this Running Man is my life?\" More content for JSJ fake life compilations \n\n- SoMin and Haha is slowly replacing my favorite SoMin pair kwangMin nowadays. SoMin staying back because she knew they'd roast her Japan plans and sure enough it was Haha who started it. \n\n- Them giving the only MZ members computers for PPT presentation while the rest got sketchbooks was hilarious. I wish they gave the oldies some computers so we could get a laugh. I remember Sukjin furiously clicking shift thinking it was enter and getting annoyed that nothing happened! \n\n- \"when did my daughter become a son?\" That's your best friend's fault, KJK. \n\n- I agree with those on the RM sub that say HyungIn is too lenient. But I've already accepted it and explained it in detail before several times. I really think it is that she is a woman and much younger working in SK and with giants like YJS and KJK. Of course she won't be able to be authoritative like chulmin. Even BoPil couldn't, but he was at least sassy and fought back at times. The only person HyungIn seems to be able to \"boss around\" (not in an abusive bossy way, just meaning the only one who seems to think of her as the boss) is SoMin and maybe a little bit SeChan. Which is why I think it's really about her being a lot younger and a woman. \n\nin case you've missed it, she was on KJK's YouTube video with BoPil and addressed BoPil with his first name and SeChan as oppa. BoPil was born in '89. This means HyungIn is either the same age as him (so also '89) or older but younger than SeChan/SoMin: '87, '88 or '89. That's basically around the same age as SoMin and SeChan and a lot younger than the rest. So it makes sense that those two are the only ones who think of her as the boss. This is SK afterall.",

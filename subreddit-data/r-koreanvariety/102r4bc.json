Based off google searches, it didn\u2019t seem like there was any news about it as far as I saw but I wondered if you guys have heard anything",

There weren't really any announcements about shooting a new season back then unless people saw the cast recording, so I would be optimistic about a new season in 2023 until this summer. He was also busy shooting The Zone so now that it's over, I'm sure we'll probably be hearing smtg soon.",

At least fans of that genre seem well served with well made shows though I guess.\n\nI'm finding things I used to watch like RM, 2d1n etc long past their sell by dates when I try to drop back in.\n\nIt feels like things are pretty lean for really good new shows atm. I have been watching Kvariety for a decade now and am struggling to find anything watchable atm. Subbed Korean Youtubers like Chuu Can Do It, MMTG etc seem better than 99% of anything on TV atm tbh.",

I watch mostly sports variety shows these days (I find them more enjoyable even though I'm not an expert in those sports) and 1N2D and RM (episodes for this is a hit or miss) from time to time.",

But Jin-young/Dex (previously from **Bloody Game (\ud53c\uc758 \uac8c\uc784)**, Love &amp; Joy, et cetera) from Single's Inferno 2 reminded some of us that ya a bunch of them were doing that military drill stuff, lmao.\n\nLook into **Fake Men/Toy Soldiers** on Youtube, wait it's removed now (there was controversy due to verbal/etc. brutality) but ya. \n\nThis is the unlisted video link for Episode 1 of Season 2 of Fake Men: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_bYmGClnxk\n\nThere's also another one called **The Soldiers**, Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88g2t7A902w\n\n\n---\n\nSurvival shows are also always in the background.\n\nFor mafia game, survival game, and so on, there's **Accomplice (\uacf5\ubc94)** if you haven't seen it already. Season 2 just started.\n\n**Accomplice Season 1 Episode 1**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5JQp6xafqc&amp;list=PLOBfcaHQ3_2X3xpGuwPRFsiqMYKpeAxE5\n\n**Accomplice Season 2 Episode 1**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CQuGIoz2sw&amp;list=PLOBfcaHQ3_2X3xpGuwPRFsiqMYKpeAxE5\n\nThere's also **Money Game (\uba38\ub2c8\uac8c\uc784)**, here's Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CxGRz9hRk4&amp;list=PLkH5IoAQDW0ZRpvuLeBbDccqzXz77AGqC&amp;index=13\n\n---\n\nLike for survival shows there's now a VRChat/etc. for Kpop idols, lmao, it's called **\uc18c\ub140 \ub9ac\ubc84\uc2a4 GIRL'S RE:VERSE**. What a time to be alive with these VTubers or like mainstream anime stuff, rofl. Never really expected it.\n\nGIRL'S RE:VERSE Episode 1 (there's Episode 4 now but apparently they started region-blocking starting with Episode 3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuFt1hzco-E and https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/101d9tf/girls_reverse_episode_1_230102_eng_sub/",

                    "comment": "&gt; I'm still enjoying RM nowadays\n\nI can't anymore, it has been an absolute slog. Between the whole controversy with the van navigation episode (the verbal talkdowns on Sukjin) and the episode with the blatant overpampering of a BTS member, I just got fed up with the usual cliches of Running Man and stopped watching altogether one or two episodes after those.\n\nMaybe I'll pine for RM eventually in the future, maybe I won't, but in the meantime, I have completely tuned out. And How Do You Play has just not been entertaining at all since the end of MSG Wannabe. WSG Wannabe was promising at first but then petered out after the auditions for me and I just tuned out as well.\n\nI tried The Zone but that ended up being lacklustre. Probably due to the smallness of the main cast, combined with the lack of the usual Kvariety BGMs played for certain things and people, and the meh-ness of most of the setups for the episodes.\n\nSixth Sense Season 3 was the highlight of last year's Kvariety for me and that only ran for 14 episodes. Plus that one \"Stay or Go\" episode of Running Man that involved boats, which felt like a return to old, classic Running Man.\n\nEarth Arcade was another highlight of last year's Kvariety for me as well. The cast was just absolute perfection and it felt like the return of old New Journey to the West with the whole travelling to other countries aspect. But, like Sixth Sense Season 3, it didn't last long either.",

The show seams really random, so it can be hit or miss, but I appreciate the effort they put into it.\nThe Door was great- I hope that returns soon.\nThere's also How Do You Play, which seems to be doing more outdoor stuff lately, which is nice.

Like maybe if you want some drama then sure, but then watch a drama instead??) and YouTube shows. The main variety demographics are people in 20s-30s and 10s-20s. Most TV variety shows cater to the first, so they're more scared to take risks and just kinda stay the same. The YouTube shows cater to the second, since cable in general has been decreasing, hence they're much more varied.",

Well, they obviously didn't really date, so the romance/flirting/etc. is likely acted for the show instead of being more real. For the most part, it was just like a cohabitation show.\n\nRoommate seems it would be exactly like Terrace House, but due to the camerawork and such, it's not. Some of the people you see in this show were/are/became pretty big (actually some of them are kinda huge now/previously) in South Korea. Imagine other countries doing this and celebrities with more relaxed or mellowed out schedules.\n\nRoommate had **Lee Dong-wook**, 2NE1 Park Bom, Jo Se-ho, After School Nana, EXO Chanyeol, Seo Kang-joon, et cetera.\n\n---\n\nAs for dating shows, for the most part nobody actually argues in East Asian dating shows, which sounds weird but it's true. They pretty much just date or do chillax group activities.\n\nIf you want a kinda really toxic dating show (gives me PTSD/flashbacks/etc. due to the circuitous conversations), Netflix has **Change Days 2**. Season 1 is available on Viki/etc. after a lot of people liked Change Days 2 on Netflix.\n\nAnyway, for Change Days it's one of those shows kinda influenced by **EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560)** (there's a bunch of them now after 2021/2022) as this time it's about couples that are about to break up.\n\nJust to be clear, for Change Days they're usually couples that are having relationship problems and so they are seeing if testing each other by dating different people will change anything, lol. Meanwhile for EXchange/Transit Love they've already broken up and so there's less of that push and pull type of thing.\n\nApparently there's actually a similar western show called The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On, also available on Netflix, lol.\n\n---\n\nBut ya, aside from Change Days or like a few other East Asian dating shows, they don't argue at all or that much. Even in Change Days it's pretty much just the couples arguing with themselves instead of other couples.\n\nIn western/Anglo/etc. dating shows, that's where you actually get people arguing for the sake of drama. There's also some yes snaking around because of like the show's rules, elimination processes, et cetera.\n\nThat's what makes East Asian dating shows so good as it's pretty much a sort of relaxed slice of life thing. Why a lot of us fell in love with Terrace House (/r/terracehouse) on Netflix. \n\nYes, some parts of dating shows are staged/scripted/et cetera for drama, tension, and such effects, but in the majority and so on of the cases, it's probably just again the casting choices and set rules.\n\n---",

Example: Full moon channel (pretty much run by na pd at this point). Broadcasting companies are also backing these ventures, just not publicly (example fearless kkura, mmtg and deundeun with yoo jae suk are by SBS). Webshows have way less broadcasting restrictions and they are able to make more money with advertisements / ppl (a few years ago, Korea put a ban on how much and often shows can have ppls). Also due to the lax restrictions for onljne content, a lot more of the larger pds are transitioning (like na pd)\n\nI imagine once they have the programming structure figured out, they will start to produce larger budget content for online shows.",

Especially when the episode features a lot of the cast (not the guests\u2019 scene) although there are guests who also have an interesting lifestyle so it\u2019s still fun to watch.\n\nMy little old boy never misses for me. It\u2019s fun especially again if there are atleast 2-3 of the casts involved.\n\nIt\u2019s always NJTTW for me but season 9 for this year seems blurry lol Na PD didn\u2019t talk about it for his plans so.\n\nI guess I\u2019m sticking to I live Alone and My little old boy. I still watch RM and 2D1N but I fastfoward it. Hit or miss episodes just like what others stated. Master in the house just isn\u2019t it for me as of now :( I hope their new episodes improve. Knowing bros also kind of different now \u2639\ufe0f I also stick to Korean YT shows.",

The turn around of KJK's attitude towards YJS was funny for me because they were very much rivals before especially when YJS brings out YEH (which became boring when SJH didnt enter with witty comebacks).",

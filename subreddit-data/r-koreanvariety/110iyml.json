    "postText": "**Description**\n\n&gt;The cast and guests play games to win and enjoy different foods from a featured outdoor market in Korea. The main game consists of listening to a song and determining the correct lyrics for a part of it while employing different hints to get closer to the solution. Every failed attempt means more food for YouTube mukbang star Small-mouthed Haetnim. During Snack Time a different game each week determines who gets to try a snack representing this week's market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Host**\n\n* Boom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Shin Dong-yeop\n* Kim Dong-hyun\n* Moon Se-yoon\n* Park Narae\n* Hanhae\n* Key\n* Nucksal\n* Taeyeon\n* Haetnim\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Guests**\n\n* **Kim Ok Vin**\n* Yoo Teo\n* Kim Ji Hoon\n\n**One Shots**\n\n|Member|2023|Overall|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Key|0 + 1|94 + 1|\n|Seyoon|1 + 1|77 + 1|\n|Hanhae|3|50|\n|P.O\\*|0|56|\n|Hyeri\\*|0|49|\n|Nucksal|1 + 1|47 + 1|\n|Narae|1|40|\n|Taeyeon|0 + 1|20 + 1|\n|Shin Dongyeob|1|16|\n|Donghyun|0|15|\n|Haetnim|0|1|\n\n\\*\\*updated based on Wiki'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Subtitles**\n\n|**Stream**|Link|\n|:-|:-|\n|Streaming site|[Viu](https://www.viu.com/ott/ph/en-us/vod/2075251/Amazing-Saturday-2023)|\n\n**Source**\n\n\\*Viu\n\n^(\\*you can still support @/dareumi from all the subtitle works they had done for the community by donating through -)  [^(ko-fi.com/dareumi)](https://ko-fi.com/dareumi) \\+",

His mischievous side was enjoyable to watch and he\u2019s definitely more comfortable with Korean compared to Honeymoon Tavern days. I couldn\u2019t stop laughing throughout the episode. &gt;!I thought he used his own hotspot to connect to the internet but getting into CJ E&amp;M wifi and banned afterwards definitely was better. !&lt; Hope he will appear on more variety after this.",

I mean,  Kim Ji Hoon would've definitely been the mvp guest on a different episode, but Teo was on a different level this time.\n\nAlso, ngl Teo channeling Pulp fiction's dance and making Taeyeon follow along did something to me. That boy has charm.",

Nothing more than that, so like no hits on purpose otherwise ya you get penalized (ball/etc. given to the other contestant) or disqualified.\n\nThe female boxers went sorta crazy with the splashing water/grappling/et cetera. Wonder if they'll actually get a real legit fight on the ring in the future, lmao. Rematch for sure. And so there's that too, but they probably give more leeway to certain contestants due to muscle/etc. restrictions or advantages.\n\nThey tried to make it a bit balanced and so it's endurance for some parts, and then like pure strength/muscle is there if you don't get gassed out by somebody who's quick with the challenges.\n\nSo those of that have experience in street fighting, military training, meditation, running, et cetera will probably win compared to those that just do bodybuilding or like do fitness content for Youtube. \n\nSome Youtubers are really yoked and so on though, they just haven't been tested yet, see the other low profile contestants for this Physical: 100 show and how they can surprise the others. Like they be really saying \"nugu?\" and then wow after, lol.\n\nDon't forget the national/Olympic/world champions/et cetera. They do have the discipline and training to also win certain challenges but ya the show is set up in a way to probably give a bit of chance to less athletic/etc. folks.\n\nPlus, like half of them are juicing/on steroids or drugs/etc. and so it's not good for their stamina, health, and all that. Some of them also have careers that can't afford serious injury and so they're probably holding back on purpose.\n\nThough it seems some people did unfortunately truly get injured while filming the show.\n\nLike I have no idea what Netflix or the production company was thinking. They didn't give them mouth guards and then earlier for the hanging part or water drop, why is the pool so shallow, smh.\n\nThis is just like Single's Inferno where there's unnecessary physical testing for little gain. Like yes there's a decent prize pool for this Physical: 100 show but usually there's not.\n\nAnd so like imagine being scouted/recruited/etc. for the show (seems a lot of people get asked by producers/etc. to appear in these shows) and then you get life-altering damage because you thought it'd be okay to try it, lol.\n\nSigh, that's me speaking as somebody that hasn't bulked up in years. And then even more past years since a legit physical fight or so. \n\nLike it's just not worth it for the ego, always walk away from these types of contact sports or any strenuous activity. \n\nIt's too much for the physical health, the mind can always take a broken pride. These days there's brain scans and so on that show the effects of mental/non-physical trauma/etc. damage though. \n\nBut ya for some people it's an impossibility to be more humble. Hell, even when people see blood or like surgery, they still proceed because somehow they think it's their calling and so on to prove to themselves/others their strength and such.\n\nOkay, enough preaching about safety and health, more IRL Squid Game for entertainment. As they say, bread and circuses are all we need for this coliseum world.",

And single's inferno dancer CHS which i already knew abt.\n\nHate to say it but for most activities won't men have an advantage? Like if it came down to most athletic man v most athletic woman. I'm not talking abt a super muscly woman compared to a smaller man. Like for example some of the women did super well in the hanging activity but in the last 9 or so of the first group there was only one woman left. And even worse for the 2nd group - one woman left in the last 31. It will be hard for a woman to win first place if there's only 1 prize.\n\nOoooh a male pole dancer! That's cool.\n\nI'm really rooting for the last woman left in group 1!!! Damnnnn top 3 was amazing.\n\nUDT guy has insaaaaane mental strength. He was way heavier than the gymnast. Woooooow good for him. Obvi mountain rescue guy/ice climber would do well. His physique is probably more functional than a lot of others on this show. \n\nI hope the women who got picked by the men can hang in there... kinda sucks they were targeted bc they thought it'd be easier to go against a woman. Respect to the people who actually chose their rivals, or people they admired. \n\nWoooooow I underestimated CHS! Didn't know he also practiced judo. Good for him for holding his own against a much bigger guy.\n\nI feel bad for the zombie choreographer. Pretty sure he would have won if he didn't accidentally elbow the gymnast. Really cool to see a speed vs strength based match-up! Their little skill-off at the end was cute! \n\nThe female boxer match was \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\n\nPutting the ball in the corner basically eliminated all those obstacles in course A, that was such a smart move for someone strong rather than fast! Yooooooo I can't believe that uni student managed to lift that guy!!! \n\nHow dare they end on a cliffhanger \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I should have known.",

The stakes are real much like a Rugby or American Football or an MMA match. \n\nI absolutely LOVE the competitiveness of this show in which it\u2019s Mano a Mano at times. It puts to bed any wonderment of how people from different backgrounds would do in some real events to prove their strength, stamina, athleticism, and overall competitiveness. It\u2019s a mix of you vs an adversary or you vs yourself. \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered how a CrossFitter, Olympian, Powerlifter, Bodybuilder, Professional Climber, Special Force member, Dancer, Pro Athlete, Fitness Influencer etc would do against each other in a gladiatorial type environment, then here you go. Just look how a Special Force man beat out a gold medal gymnast in a hanging pull-up in which last man remaining wins. Where else would you get to see this kind of a match-up? \n\nIt reminds me of the early days of UFC fights in America in which they had all types of martial artists just go at it against each other in a cage. Like a boxer vs BJJ artist or a Sumo Wrestler vs a kickboxer. Insane. \n\nI would highly advise watching this Season before they input more restrictions and safeguards for season 2. This is raw and real. \n\nLet\u2019s fucking goooooooo",

This is the teaser/trailer for that Korean dating show, it's from wavve: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBOY_yyR1DQ\n\nTry to watch until Episode 2 and 3 of Sleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774), it was so ridiculous and hilarious. You'll probably be howling with the panelists, from laughter and shock, like rofl.\n\nIn Sleeping Only Relationship there's hysterical af scenes due to some cast members, like it's actually crazy how unexpectedly funny the show was. It starts off with gloomy rainy weather but ya imagine if they had better filming conditions and production, it would've been maybe way better.\n\n**For Sleeping Only Relationship they have \"unrestricted\" time from 6PM to 6AM, so that includes their dates at restaurants, etc. Usually they end up sleeping around 12/1AM, etc. and then they have to be ready by ~7/8AM.**\n\nSleeping Only Relationship doesn't have an official English sub. But it does have a fan sub right now from iheartu2 (from Youtube and Twitter), check their Twitter and Youtube pages for more info.\n\n---\n\n**Compiled list of other East Asian dating shows (this is initially sorta \"scandalous\" dating shows, click through the thread links for more other info)**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/y83ke7/pink_lie_episode_4_discussion_spoilers/j584452/\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and more info on where to watch them**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/10is12e/where_i_can_find_terrace_house_seasons_before_the/j5i25id/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/1076jds/good_dating_shows/j3kxjmx/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zyn2y0/regarding_the_popularity_of_the_different_dating/j2a8bok/",

The show is riveting thus far and I\u2019m peeved I can\u2019t binge this!! Not a fan of the steady slow release!! \ud83d\ude14\u2026 UDT reservist is elite! What a beast.. can\u2019t wait to see how many twists emerge on this show!!! So fascinating so far!! I think all the contestants that actually use their physique for actual work will thrive\u2026 body building is after all more about aesthetic than brute strength. How the muscles look, symmetry, etc.. ice climber, firefighters, MMA guys, Former military, they should definitely shine!! Intrigued to see how some of the female participants do against the men.. I have a strange feeling that first lad that picked a woman is going to get surprised in an unpleasant way!! Hahaha. That\u2019s just how these things usually go. He didn\u2019t look or seem too intimidating either so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised in the least. I really think Choo Sung Hoon (MMA fighter \u201cMiddle Aged guy\u201d \ud83d\ude1c) is going to thrive in this 1 on 1\u2026 he will probably destroy whoever he goes against as control of your opponent seems to be a key tactic and he\u2019ll probably be the most accomplished at that given everyone else is using poor MMA techniques naturally innately to get the upper hand! Was really surprised the \u201cStrongest\u201d man in Korea lost. After he got the ball I was like there\u2019s no way he loses and I initially loved his idea of just shielding and guarding the ball in a corner. When he stretched himself too thin going far away from the ball wrapping the other contestant up I knew he was about to lose !! Hahahahah!! He had such a great strategy!! Why get away from it!?? And then he got flipped over because he\u2019s so top heavy, easily and de\u201dballed.\u201d \ud83e\udd23\u2026 was fun to watch. But truly goes to show nothing will be predictable in my opinion! Anyone can win and anyone can lose!! I love that the rules aren\u2019t spelled out perfectly. This allows for intellect and out of box thinking/strategy to prevail. We all know the perfect body is never just physical. The intellectual savvy must accompany and some of the contestants are already showing they\u2019re willing to stretch the limits of rules and strategy to win (see the woman that came in top 5 with her hanging strat!!) I bet there will be so many occasions throughout the season that contestants utilize unorthodox methods to emerge victorious and I\u2019m all for it. To beat 99 other contestants one will have to be more than just physically dominant. They\u2019ll have to have used savvy and keen thinking to outsmart occasionally and outwit!! I\u2019m all for it!!! Can\u2019t wait to watch more!!!! I\u2019m thrilled!!",

The way I see it even though the strike seemed entirely accidental it's important to incentivize people not to do it and that rule accomplishes that. It won't always be easy to \"prove\" it was an accident etc so a blanket rule makes sense to me.\nSeemed like they both took it in strides though and I loved their bout the most.",

No idea why they chose that route.",

We saw in the hanging challenge only 1 woman made it into the top 9 in the first group and only one made it into the top 31 for the 2nd group. It will be really hard (nearly impossible?) for the most fit/athletic woman to beat the most fit/athletic man in anything to win the grand prize.",

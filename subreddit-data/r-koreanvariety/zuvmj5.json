            "comment": "This was such a fun episode. Probably one of my favorites of the year. I was enjoying every minute of it. The twist after the shopping segment was really good but also really mean heh. However the rest of the games made up for it. Giving gifts to citizens by playing games with them is totally like an old school RM concept. I love episodes where they go out in public as it's always fun to see their reactions and interactions. Of course people went crazy for Jaesuk and wouldn't even boo him lol!\n\nI felt bad for Haha who canceled all his orders thinking the gifts he got were for himself. But then the gift choices made for some entertaining prizes as many of them were just bad. I actually thought it was sweet how Jaesuk kept telling that female waitress to re-choose her prize 3 times since he felt bad. She kept picking the worst ones. Though she was a really good sport and was really happy no matter what she won. Also when the citizen at the exercise place won a pretty meh prize, it was nice of Jongkook to voluntarily offer to take a selca as a bonus. \n\nJaesuk not being able to touch the ground was a funny concept because of how it made him look in public. When he was carted it looked like he was a baby or he was sick. Sukjin had to tell people he wasn't sick lol! I really missed Kwangsoo this episode because I know he'd be carrying around Jaesuk most of the time and they'd have some memorable interactions... ah well. Then one of my favorite scenes was when they went to the buffet and they had to carry Jaesuk around while he picked out food - Jaesuk picked pretty basic foods. I did think it was mean for Sechan to pick out the wrong food for Jaesuk then coldly refuse to go with him to pick out the right food, as Jaesuk did look a bit annoyed. Luckily Somin is always up for more screen time. It was hilarious how Sukjin volunteered but he got tired so fast. Jaesuk and Sukjin are always hilarious together. Somin sucks at most games but she at least makes it fun and entertaining and invites the cast to ridicule her, unlike another girl who really struggles to do anything.\n\nI was surprised that my favorite part was the random prize drawing parts. The ending was fun to see what the RM members would ultimately get out of the random lottery. I'm bummed they had the ultimate prize of the Royal Salute whiskey and since no one drew the number it was given away randomly off screen. That was the only bad part of this episode which was kind of anti-climatic. Overall, imo one of the best episodes of 2022!",

Epistode 628. she's known on the show as one of the better drivers, too. the thing is, one such incident is not any reason to think anything. it could literally just be an accident... but putting all of these things together it does look sus.\n\nand like you said, she might just have some mental health issues. i myself have gone through depressive episodes. doing anything takes so much energy. even showering and brushing your teeth. but the obvious signs of depression are sleeping too mcuh or too little eating too much or too little (gain and losing weight), not leaving the house, cutting off contact with the world and just drowning your sorrorws using any substances (for me its weed cuz I dont like drinking)... so I get it.\n\nI hope thats not the case, but i wish at least the show didn't glorify it or make it seem like a cute character trait. it really isnt/",

Then from 12 to 5, she does chores (clean hours and prep for dinner?). Then she takes her dog out for a walk and eat dinner by 7 and then watch tv and sleep at midnight. \n\nthe last show she did was two years ago. (outside of rm) she's been lacking in rm for years now, never winning awards unless its a apopularity poll voted by fans (winning \"best communication\" even she was flabbergasted) \n\nenjoy drinking is different from drinking so much you cut all your hair or sleep on park benches or go to work late or buying alcohol for an office or having smell of alcohol relaxing you or getting into accidents on your way to work on a mid morning shoot (10AM)... \n\nshe also doesn't leave her house. she doesn't socialize, not even online via group chats. she doesn't have many friends (social media posts are mostly her team, people who work for her and are paid by her). she doesn't seem like she has many or rather any hobbies... \n\nsorry but as someone who does live exactly like this, I can promise you, she isn't happy. take sjh out of the equation. if I tell you all of the above about myself, wouldn't you think at least that this person is going through something? it isn't helpful to diagnose people and depression is much more complicated than just so easily asying \"oh youre sad that means you're depressed\"... but if this wasn't about a real person and just a piece of information about some imaginary person and they asked you what you think, you'd think either depressed, on their way to becoming depressed, coming out of depression (cause she does do a few things during her day: cook, clean and take her dog for walk) or just a very old or boring person. \n\nshe could just be a super boring middle aged woman who is lonely too. who knows. but im just saying, it doesnt really look like shes in a good place. not even based on these, but just how she is on the show and how she acts. \n\nlike in this episode, yjs and ysc said she was \"calm\" as maknaes were running around seeing the place. calm is a very nice way to describe it. the way she looked  read more as her thinking she doesn't have that much energy or joy anymore. \n\nin any case. i don't mean for any of this to be a judgment. if it is, it's because I'm angry at myself becuase of how similar I am to her. This is pretty much exactly how I'm existing now (except the dog part cuz I don't even have that). no friends, no social life, no job, no nothing. so I get it! which is why this is so triggering for me. seeing a celebrity not being able to get out of this rut is so scary for some reason. like if she can't do it, what hope is there for someone like me? \n\nand again, if any of this sounds judgy it's because I'm judging myself not her",

I don\u2019t think she has depression. The things you mentioned would be concerning if a person was suddenly acting out of the ordinary. But SJH has always been like this. \n\nShe\u2019s always been one of those people who needed a lot of sleep. She eats once a day because she sleeps through breakfast and lunch. After she finishes her chores, dinner time comes up so she goes ahead and eats then. \n\nShe has always been calm and kind of a tomboy. She\u2019s not the type of person to pretend to gush and scream for the camera because it\u2019s awkward to her. That\u2019s completely fine. It\u2019s just a personality difference. Has nothing to do with age. \n\nShe\u2019s wealthy enough to relax for the rest of her life, and that\u2019s what she\u2019s been doing. She\u2019s also very private so you may think she doesn\u2019t have friends but that\u2019s because she prefers to keep her private life to herself.\n\nAs for her drinking alcohol, half the RM members have similar problems. JSM, LKS, Haha, maybe YSC are all heavy drinkers who have been chided for going overboard. This isn\u2019t solely a SJH problem. The culture there encourages rampant drinking and we can see that in the cast. \n\nI will agree with you that her performance on RM isn\u2019t satisfying. She doesn\u2019t contribute much and I think she could have voluntarily bowed out a long time ago. However, I don\u2019t think that excuses drastic assumptions about her private life or her current mental state.",

I believe comments like these would be better if  they came from a hardcore Jihyo fan (better in a private forum) because then at least people would know they are coming from a genuine place of concern. Apologies to the OP who might be genuinely concerned. I don't know. However, it can cause fan wars and bad feelings towards other cast members and frankly I'm tired of that.  As a Somin fan, in the past I've read comments about her possible bad drinking habits too and those  people making those comments haven't held back. They've called her an alcoholic, drunk etc. We can just wish for both ladies to have the best physical and mental health and leave it at that.\nHopefully anything I've said hasn't offended anyone. If I have offended anyone including the OP, then my genuine apologies.",

I dont particularly like sjh, but my comment isn't really even about her - more about the show if that makes sense. and I know it's not just RM but korean shows in general. I find the jokes about alcohol use kind of tough to laugh at having known waht it can do to people. It seems at times that running man at least uses this as a \"personality trait\" or makes it into a cutesy thing - like look at this tiny woman who can outdrink all the dudes! No, it's not cute nor should be framed as such.\n\nand i didn't even bring up jsm here, so I don't understand your point about her. I haven't been active here for a while so I might be out of the loop. One thing i remember with her, now that you mentioned her, is on 6th sense. when they visited the Shauman he said \"I can smell the alcohol on you\" and everyone else followed kind of jokingly like oh you too and I felt bad but also, it wasn't to glorify her drinking. quite the opposite. It was to scold her about it and she herself felt bad about it. In fact, on RM she has said as her new years resolution once that she likes to drink less.\n\ndrinking isn't the issue. and I'm not calling any of them alcoholics. I'm saying the way RM uses this heavy drinking trope in regards to sjh is unfunny and frankly sad because I think it actualy might be a real issue for her. like it would be fine to joke about those things with YSC, cause he doesn't show signs of being on his way to having a serious problem (i mean still isn't the best thing to joke about but at least we know its not true or at least we have fewer reasons to believe its true). sjh does as I listed out in my op. isolated incidents don't mean anything, but listing them out like this you start to see it's a little bit more than just a one-off bad drinking night...\n\nI'm allowed to criticize the show about using a serious illness and addiction as a \"cute\" character trait or something to joke about though. i don't understand why i need to be a sjh hardcore fan for my opinion to be valid. it isn't even about her. replace her with any other character and i'd say the same thing if they had shown those same behaviours as well.",

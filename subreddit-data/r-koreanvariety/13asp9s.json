The six members with different charms become friends  faster  than anyone else. They create tension, showing off their  visuals, talents, and charms as they over indulge in games.

Their chemistry is also insane, and with the PD/staffs. Even the trailer at the end seemed really cool. I went into this because of Yena, Chaewon and Miyeon but Hyeri might be my favorite, she's just been too funny in these 9 episodes. What am I gonna do on Monday after the last three episodes...\n\nAlso a bit unrelated and I may have missed it, but does anyone know the area/region this show was filmed?",

They all now know each other well enough to have bickering feel natural and the yutnori game was really well placed. \n\nAll of the girls are very well cast, even though some of them have not been in variety before. I especially love the dynamic between Chaewon and Lee Jung, they been having a go at each other all this while. I just find it hilarious that the other unnies are whipped for Chaewon but Lee Jung see through her. \n\n3 more episodes left and I don\u2019t want this to end. Hopefully they got a nice gaming system or the spa thing that they wanted at the start.",

I know they change the question type but it's starting to get repetitive (answer, dance, answer, fail, still dance) , why not try a drama/movie quiz like in Amazing saturday, they have many variations for the snack quiz that isn't just kpop related. \n\nDespite that, I still enjoyed the whole episode, it felt like an episode of running man where the winning team gets a reward, while the other team is stuck doing something else just to eat.",

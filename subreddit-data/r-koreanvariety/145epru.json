Why am I thinking of ex-ioi members Chaeyeon/Sejeong or Lim Jiyeon (from the glory)\n\nNew guy slot: this slot is so hard to predict, but if the casting is done around this time maybe one of the Bloody game 2 contestants has a chance? (I have no idea as both Dex and Xitsuh seems like a disaster)\n\nWow! I'm so out of touch with Korean entertainment landscape that my options look so limited \ud83d\ude05",

            "comment": "It's a pretty easy gig as mystery variety shows go so I can definitely see the more proactive members of recent girl groups like Chaewon or Yunjin from Le Serrafim, Yujin or Rei from IVE,  maybe Mimi for (G)I-DLE since she's been promoting on so many different variety shows and she's an absolute riot. I can also see maybe Sieun from STAYC since she has some acting experience and Hani from EXID cuz she's done it before and I'd personally like to see her again. JYP used to send his girl group members on lots of variety shows but maybe it's because I don't keep up with the scene, groups like ITZY or NMIXX, I just don't see them doing this show. \n\nAs for the male casts, since they're likely to include male comedians to provide a counterbalance to Jiyoon, I reckon it could be somebody like Byungjae. As for the new guy slot, I have zero idea about male boy groups and they're unlikely to join this kind of show anyways unless they're guesting as a 2nd gen variety-dol. It's probably close to 100% it's gonna be a young male actor so if Jihoon was the older actor and Minkyu was S3's new guy, then S4 would probably get somebody on the same level. \n\nHonestly though, I'm kinda hoping Jinho also comes back though he might not be able to schedule it given his other shows. He's been so active lately and it'd be nice to see him in a friendlier competition that's not cutthroat survival and is in studio (especially after his Bloody Game injury).",

But maybe because most young girl roles before are good actors so I expected someone with more acting background. And if it someone from Le Serrafim I think it might be Sakura\n\n&gt;Hani from EXID cuz she's done it before and I'd personally like to see her again\n\nI'd like to see her too! But I don't think they will cast old members on this role. \ud83e\udd72 There's a high chance she will come as a guest tho.\n\n&gt;As for the male casts, since they're likely to include male comedians to provide a counterbalance to Jiyoon, I reckon it could be somebody like Byungjae.\n\nI don't know many comedians so it was a blank for me.\n\n&gt;As for the new guy slot, I have zero idea about male boy groups and they're unlikely to join this kind of show anyways\n\nThis slot is the most flexible in my opinion since they cast Jang Jin for season 2. Other than actors and idols, they also have an option of rappers and dancers since they seemed to pop up a lot on other survival shows for some reason.\n\n&gt;Honestly though, I'm kinda hoping Jinho also comes back though he might not be able to schedule it given his other shows\n\nI also want him to comeback and I think PD will most likely recruit him as well because he is on the rise lately. The only thing that can stop Jinho from appearing is his schedule \ud83d\ude2d",

Didn't know they're making season 4!\n\nAside from Park Jiyon, Jang Jin and Jinho who are shoe-ins, i really liked Yang Sehyung in s3 (his [performance as hermit](https://youtu.be/OXZ9_ywDwDE?t=823) still lives rent free in my head).\n\nHopefully they new (old?) production staff can reach insane twists they did in s2 and especially s3.",

Then again, maybe he will do well on a more friendly environment. I also think he maybe good at another skills set like finding evidences so it will be interesting to see him on the role.\n\n&gt;Young girl role might go to Haewon of nmixx, pd might wanna try her ability on kvariety show or maybe Liz of IVE.\n\nThe thing is, crime scene rarely use brand new people who have never been on any show before for this role (maybe the only exception is NS yoonji) and I have the impression that they will not do it because young girl slot is the most easy position to get criticized for poor casting. But maybe the casting team will surprise me.",

Already has chemistry with Jiyoon and familiarity with the PD through Girl's High School Mystery Class and experience with mafia style variety shows\n\nNew guy slot: Maybe Joo Woo Jae? He's known to be smart and has acting experience. Only problem is that he's so busy these days.\n\nComedian: Love mcsavatar's suggestion of Byungjae\n\nThose three plus Jiyoon and Jinho/Dongmin would be a stacked cast imo. High level of smarts in the group and every member is entertaining individually as well.",

He played a minor role as the detective's assistant right, but he got his big break as an actor over the past few years. It would feel very satisfying for him to return as part of the main casts. Or at least cameo as a detective in an episode, saying \"I've been promoted!\". That would make for a good easter egg. \n\nThough I really hope Jinho will come out again, looking at his packed tournament schedule, it's really hard to see Jinho returning to Crime Scene. The filming is not done in one go like survival shows after all.",

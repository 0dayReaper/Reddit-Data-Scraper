And this was the weakest one too, guess this group wasn't that interesting.\n\nThat one woman who said she wants to breed with man with good genes, cause humans are here to reproduce was the wildest icebreaker conversation I've ever heard on Korean dating show LMAO, can't blame the guy from hitting skip ASAP.",

Then I realized we are only getting one episode, and it is the last episode \ud83d\ude43 \nthat left me perplexed and confused cause we didn't really see enough to guess which couple was forming. The ending came out of nowhere. I feel like that made this episode was less enjoyable when it came to contestants, but the hosts were as great as ever.\n\nDoes anyone know if we are getting season 2, or is this the end? Did the show not perform as expected, or was this the plan from the beginning?",

Would be very surprising if the show came back without major reform. I'd imagine that it didn't catch on with the general population as there are many other dating shows out there and this one always felt like more of a variety show then a show where contestants were actually trying to find love.",

Disappointed the talent show got cut short. I enjoy listening to anyone sing Password 486 even if they are bad singers. \n\nDisappointed that this group had to cram everything into 1 episode, it seemed like a good mix of personalities. This show would have benefited from airing 2 episodes a week to finish out each group. Overall, I enjoyed the show and thought it was funny. I never really care about anyone after a dating show, but I hope Kyung Tae is still going at it lmao.",

Someone to elevate his \"status\"? Ok it makes sense now knowing he used to be insecure about his weight - the insecurity is still there so he's still trying to prove himself to others. I'm not surprised he wanted to show off his back lol. The dance was good tho.\n\nSM is shooting her shot w all the men today given it's the last day of filming \ud83d\ude02\n\nDidnt they say all the men would be Is and all the women would be Es this week for MBTI? BJ is an E tho? And BitNa is an I! False advertising lol. \n\nMinjoon is hilarious lol she says the weirdest things, like abt her reproductive instincts and wanting to get into someone's subconsciousness\n\nI would not be surprised if YJ had idol training! That was a nearly pro-lvl performance.\n\nLol SM and YS keep using the word gaslighted to mean hypnotized \n\nI hope someone will link us to the remaining talent clips if any of them were worth watching?\n\nWait did they skip airing the handholding convos? They showed the clip of bitna and BJ but not the whole segment right? Oh i guess they are condensing 2 eps into 1? \n\nOmg i want the big tray of food HJ prepared lol looks so good \n\nHJ should have been more straightforward if he liked BN - the last convo is not the time to hold back! Ahhhh he messed up. That was one of the deciding factors. Although, I guess she wouldn't have chosen anyone if he did muster up the courage lol so it was kinda lose-lose \n\nOmg MJ found a match from 5 min of convo! So interesting that some people like when someone is similar to them and other people look for their opposites (like how YJ didn't like CY bc he was too similar to her).\n\nAwwww the pics of former participants hanging out in groups were nice too.\n\nI wonder if this show will come back?",

Maybe it helped that it was a bit of a bridge show between variety and reality and I also recently started slowly going through Unexpected Business, which mixes a variety/reality aspect but shows more interactions with real people and I must say it's a real pleasure experiencing this kind of content. \nIf anyone has any suggestions of some other shows, please suggest any, if you happen to stumble upon this comment!",

Or maybe it's exactly because they didn't seem like the typical influencers who are there just to promote themselves (although they did seem to promote their businesses instead).",

As has been the case with every episode so far, this one is hilarious!\n\nAnd it's also always nice to see the chemistry Jessi has with Running Man members. They gel so well.  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGp82xo5QLw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGp82xo5QLw)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you haven't watched the previous episodes yet, do so if you want a good laugh.",

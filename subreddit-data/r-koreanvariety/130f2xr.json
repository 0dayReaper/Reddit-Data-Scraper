John spoke to her in English first before realising it wouldn't be good for Korean audience so he switched to Korean. Chloe was great in 1v1 situations because of her cool headedness but when many things happen around her she's quite passive and doesn't take risks lol. I sometimes wonder about how her group mate jeewon would do in these situations, since she has better people skills than Chloe.",

The game would be even more chaotic with more players and even more rigged with less, so it's probably okay with 5 players remaining, but i still wish it was a better game.\n\nIn general, player has the power to change the outcome for as long as he keeps the lights on. Even 1st player can still turn a sure bet into wild guess all the way to the last player. Additionally by keeping the lights on, you're also denying 1 point from players who can still randomly guess.",

I\u2019m so surprised that these people are getting information on these games a day in advance and never coming up with good strategies. \n\nAll they had to do was put hyun kyu first every time and then choose the person on their team with the highest points as the buffer in 2nd. \n\nThen they simply keep the lights on and keep guessing all on until hyun kyu turns them off and once they learn that he turned them off everyone on the alliance turns their lights off and gets 6 points. \n\nThe moment he turns his light off he loses. Every round the alliance can agree on a predetermined number of lights to turn off and always guess that number until hyun kyu turns his light off. This would make it impossible for him to gain points. He would be forced to essentially take a gamble on 1in6 odds to guess the right number. Even if he targets a certain player it would be really difficult for him because that player with still have 50/50 odds for 4 rounds in a row. Much better than his 1in6 odds and when the targeted player wins they win 6points.",

Yes, it\u2019s really unfortunate for Chloe that the 2 rounds she tried to sabotage Hyunkyu, the JJJ alliance also choose to sabotage it and instead helping Hyunkyu. Jeseong also lucked out in Round 1 by John\u2019s fortunate mistake. The last round is 50/50 and it comes down to mind game in the end. Her mindset of trying to sabotage is right but it\u2019s just bad timing. !&lt;\n\n&gt;! Doesn\u2019t really like the rule of the game that the player got to choose the player in each round instead of rotating players. The advantage should be only 1 time thing and can use only once. Anyway, kudos to John for making good use of time bank and clearly had more time than anyone else which gave him an edge. Also, I think it would be a good idea to have another additional items like \u201cswitch light on\u201d which can let the player switch light on once in the game which can create more chaos.!&lt;\n\nAbout the player:\n&gt;! John Park - I will be seriously disappointed if he didn\u2019t get to the final. His ability to understand the game, create strategy is really impressive so far. Also, his ability to use \u201ctime\u201d wisely and deposit in Time bank, spent just right amount of time gives him edge in the Kairos game. People said they wanted to see new Dongmin, new Jinho, new Hyunmin but John Park is John Park and he is great on his own. If he wins, it\u2019s totally deserved.!&lt;\n\n&gt;! Jinho - More chaotic in this episode which could also make thing easily go south for him and his alliance but sometimes unpredictability is good. And he will become even more scary now when it comes down to individual portion of the game. John Vs Jinho final? Please!!! !&lt;\n\n&gt;! Hyunkyu - Seems he also had a ladyluck on his side, his underdog story is building and he could surprised us and went to the final. Did I see him win the whole thing? I would still say it\u2019s a long shot but he showed in today\u2019s game that he would do anything to survive (in a good way, not Eumkyu way) and I like this mindset. !&lt;\n\n&gt;! Jeseong - His R3 move was terrific and cleared doubts that could create in later rounds. He had done a very good job in team game\u2026yes, team game. However, he would have to do a lot more in individual game and I hardly see him beating John/Jinho in 1 Vs 1. Still impressive showing from him by far and comedic relief.!&lt;\n\nI won\u2019t mind at all for anyone of them to win as I think they deserved it in some way.\n\nOkay last but not least.\n&gt;! Chloe - Yes, my dark horse is gone, very unfortunate for her timing and things didn\u2019t quite go well with her today. Still prove that she was here to seriously play the game. Some may think she was undeserving or think that she was weak but I want to say her showing her worth in these 7 Episodes. Some said that she didn\u2019t deserve to go this far but honestly looking at it 1 Vs 1 she deserved to go further than all 5 that eliminated before her so I don\u2019t know what other people think but at least she changed my perspective from \u201cjust a cute clueless girl\u201d in Episode 1 to \u201cShe did great enough\u201d in the end. !&lt;\n\nThere are 3 more episodes left, so it\u2019s gonna be Final 2 in the last episode then. Arrgh, have to wait for 1 week for new episode\u2026it pains me hahaha",

I don't know if the games were already determined per round, or if they adjust it depending on the environment of the show to make stuff more interesting but I just did not like it all.\n\nIve been reading some opinions on the players and though I will agree that some had more help than others, specially when it comes to information, I think its just part of the game and it would seem rude to somewhat discredit their skill. The VIP getting information about the game beforehand is an advantage that allows you to strategize a good 3-4 solid hours than others. Yes, the information does leak but it leaks because the players who had that information want to gain more people to their side or have a \"spy\" for example. So &gt;!CHLOE !&lt;being able to practice the Checkout game is just the same, its an advantage of information because you get to experience the game and learn from it firsthand. Next, cracking under pressure and making a bad play could've been because the opponent was playing so well that you are pressured to not make a mistake, and &gt;!EONKYU !&lt;sacrificing himself for &gt;!CHLOE !&lt;for me doesn't count as saving her because if we look at &gt;!EONKYU's!&lt; image where his sole goal would be just to eliminate &gt;!JINHO !&lt;then that would have been the perfect game for it, the auction. As long as &gt;!JINHO !&lt;wasn't in 1st place, he could've just bid a billion each time and hoarding everything and still choose &gt;!JINHO !&lt;for his opponent because he wouldn't have been exempted. Lastly, &gt;!JINHO !&lt;being chaotic this episode was pretty fun to watch because he usually isn't like that so please calm down with the hate people lol.",

The previous comment said that the game has ZERO potential for betrayal because from what they said there wasn't a reward and a checkout game for it which I disagree with becuase not having a checkout game makes it 100% that if you can make that certain player last they are eliminated without giving them a chance to save themselves in a 1v1 checkout game. No Winner Reward, I think that if I was any other player among those 4 excluding Jinho, I would feel more comfortable being in the top 4 and possibly playing in the finals without the one most would consider the strongest player in the game and that would be a decent reward, increasing my own rate of success. Btw I do not hate or have any malice towards Jinho, I just use him as the example because I think if I had the power to be able to control the game in a way where I can decide who gets to be eliminated or if were in the 3-man alliances' shoes I would choose to betray Jinho because of how strong he is as a player",

Chloe didn\u2019t give him free +1 points, she tried to sabotage him and Hyunkyu would have been doomed but he got lucky for 2 rounds by JJJ chose to sabotaged him at the same time as Chloe. Hyunkyu would be eliminated easily with 0 points but everything was going well for him. (2 failed sabotage, Chloe also got sabotaged by no reason, Chloe failed 50/50 in the end). I also don\u2019t know what JJJ alliance was thinking especially Jinho. He sabotaged Chloe without a reason (Panic from Hyunkyu success?) in Round 1. John Park played okay but considered from playing at the last position, it\u2019s pretty disappointing since he could do so much more to ensure Hyunkyu\u2019s elimination. Anyway, I don\u2019t really like teaming up against 1 single person so I\u2019m glad Hyunkyu survived.!&lt;\n\n&gt;! Jeseong using his guts payed off big time (with some lucky) and his R3 move is amazing. Chloe couldn\u2019t do much apart from trying to sabotage Hyunkyu to fail and hoping for +3 at best for her round. Anyway JJJ could ensure her some safety if they all switched off to give her more points but at that time Jinho was a big mess lol. Well, luck wasn\u2019t on her side this time. !&lt;\n\n&gt;! Also, agree about having no checkout game is bad. It will give some more dynamics into the game since Hyunkyu/Chloe could be last and chose 1 of JJJ alliance to the checkout game. And the alliance would have more chance to betray each other for individual win or they could work harder for joint wins. !&lt;\n\n&gt;! Also, I certainly agree about JJJ alliance failed to set their goals for the game. For alliances that have so much information for the main game (apart from Ep.5), they couldn\u2019t utilize it to full potential. They lost Namhee in Ep.2. Jinho would be gone in Ep.4 and 6 if not for Jiyeon/Eunkyu\u2019s mistakes. Ep.7 they had everything to ensure Hyunkyu\u2019s elimination but they also failed. They succeeded in only Ep.3 (when they worked with Jiyeon/Hyunkyu instead to target the maknaes) and Ep.5 (because it\u2019s not alliance game, also Jeseong would go to checkout game if Jiyeon didn\u2019t deposit her time and he could be eliminated). They were all so lucky that they were all in Top 4.!&lt;",

The Genius had so many more amazing big brain plays and they were thinking of their strategies on the spot. \n\nIts been so annoying to see teams get information on what the next game would be and then go into the game with absolutely 0 strategies prepared. \n\nWith that being said, Jinho misplayed in most of the games this series squeaking by twice on technicalities. However I don\u2019t think Jinho misplayed in the on/off game, since the numbers were getting so small the alliance was guaranteed to break up either this game or the next game. As soon as Jinho heard this game had no checkout game, he correctly assumed that everyone would be trying to target him. The only problem was that the other 4 people were too dumb to even think about targeting Jinho. John was the only one smart enough to think about betraying the alliance but for some unknown reason John decided to stick with the alliance instead of just switching sides. At this point in the game you need to partner up with Hyun Kyu because he is the weakest player, he\u2019s basically guaranteed to lose the final 1v1. I\u2019d also partner up with Chloe because while she might be good enough to win the 1v1, I wouldn\u2019t mind losing the final to her. The last thing I would want is to see Jinho win. He\u2019s won enough competitions in his life.",

            "comment": "Wow, this was a great episode. My fear was that &gt;!Eonkyu leaving!&lt; would make the game boring with the Jinho alliance rolling the other two. That is essentially what happened with them trying to &gt;!railroad Hyunkyun out !&lt; but luckily for the sake of our entertainment things didn't go as planned.\n\nI have to say I am pretty surprised at Jinho's performance, his mental focus seems to crumble very quickly. He became &gt;!very paranoid of betrayal early on. Him bringing up betraying John Park when they still have CHLOE and Hyunkyun in the game is very odd. Then during the game he got so flustered at Jeseong's good predictions that Jeseong had to pay a 2 hour Jinho tax just to stabilize the alliance. It was an amazing headsup play and Jeseong definitely controlled the flow of the game right there, but its kinda hilarious that their alliance lost 2 hours because Jinho randomly became suspicious of Jeseong who just hours ago he was saying he wanted to go to the end with. Then Jinho also messed up during CHLOE's turn... idk.!&lt; I hope Open Pass God Jinho returns to us someday soon, I want to root for that guy.\n\nI was also very impressed by Hyunkyun's &gt;!survival, he was able to mindgame John Park pretty well and control the game in some rounds despite having the most disadvantaged position. He is not as active as he could be outside of games but then again its hard to blame him since the Jinho alliance is so insular and he has no chance of breaking in.!&lt; CHLOE was not very impressive this episode, &gt;!failing to coordinate with the Jinho alliance despite the clear bias they had towards eliminating Hyunkyun. I think it was a good time for her to leave, also excited to see how John copes with losing his ally.!&lt;\n\nOverall a very entertaining episode. I want to see how &gt;!Jeseong!&lt; plays more individually first, but overall I think I am rooting for him to take the whole thing.",

            "comment": "Interesting episode. The game does have some aspects of randomness but clearly there was an element of strategy as well. But in the last round I feel they missed a chance to make sure the 5th person knew if there was interference, at the cost of their own points.\n\n&gt;!I feel like the 3 guys didn't strategize much though and couldn't trust each other. John Park's decision to not come clean was I think misguided. It led to this murky mystery feeling where no one could trust anyone.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Hyun Kyu did pull it out at the end but it was down to 50/50 and I could not believe that he actually thought the people on the other team, who just basically denounced him in public completely, would go with his plan? Who would help him? That was bonkers to me! He just seemed like such a passive player for so many rounds.!&lt;",

Had stayed beyond their actual talent... the few rounds where they were supposedly \"smart\" was also because of someone's coaching\n\nHAPPY that the deserving candidate played on their own and WON!!! .. True underdog win .. and the other lesson is that trickery can only take you so far",

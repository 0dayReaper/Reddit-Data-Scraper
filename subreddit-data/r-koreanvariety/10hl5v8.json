I think it's super interesting someone like him with all his quirks and flaws and realness became so popular when south korea is equally obsessed with perfection.",

In his earlier 30s he was wilder and tried to cling to his youth and now he makes more of an effort to take care of people in his own unique way, but says way more grumpy/wistful old man-like things. I'm into it lol.",

It\u2019s been 2 years and I think I\u2019ve rewatched seasons 3 and 4 about ten times. \n\nObviously you all are more involved in the community than I am, have you heard any new information? \n\nThanks a whole bunch!",

            "comment": "Unfortunately I think there will be no TGE anymore, since Jung PD left CJ and naturally tvN. Also there are rumors that new Director of tvN doesn't allow shows to get more than 3 seasons anymore (according to Koreans in social networks and internet forums). \n\nAlso the last update on their YouTube channel was a year ago and there are probably issues with broadcasting copyrights, so the future of the show doesn't look good.",

It seems like a bad business decision if you are actively preventing a 4th season of a very successful show that rakes in viewers.",

After 3 seasons, a lot of shows either get stale (people complain that it's boring because nothing is changing/they fail to innovate enough) or they change too much and alienate their core audience.  Better to end on a high note with high ratings than to drag it on and end with a last season with low ratings.\n\nEven if they decided to resurrect it without JJYPD, but keep the same cast, P.O wouldn't be around anyway, as he's currently in the military...Although whether or not they'd even be willing to sign on to do the show without him is unknown, not to mention just how much creative control he had on the plot, etc.",

            "comment": "Lmao i like the 4th guy who came in and started playing MC/declaring his desperation\n\nI also like the woman from daegu who fell for a guy bc he prevented her hair from going into a plate of food \ud83d\ude02\n\nOmggggg restaurant ceo woman is so impressive. I wonder if she'll be too intimidating for the men or if they'll like her being so good at her job \n\nAll the women's jobs are so cool! \n\nOmggggg imagine meeting your actual ideal type/\"celeb\" crush on a dating show! I hope diving instructor and oking hit it off! \n\nLol the med student who wanted to meet people in diff fields got automatically paired up w an oriental dr \n\nAt least they upgraded the waiting room! Nice to see that this show is still evolving. They don't have to stay standing/staring at each other silently anymore in a random hallway. \n\nBased on their ages, it sounds like the restaurant ceo will only be interested in the fashion ceo. I kinda ship them.\n\nOmgggg the restaurant ceo cooking as her talent was so cool! And then giving it to the person she liked! So smart and charming. I'm rooting for her! Also her lunchbox is gonna be 20/10 in quality. \n\nI wonder who fashion CEO will pick! Looks like almost everyone fell for the cheerleader after the talent show.\n\nAlso where do we watch the unreleased clips of the rest of the talents?",

I don't know why, but I expect a 33 year old (34 last group, 33 the group before) to want something deeper rather than a girl dancing to newjeans songs. No offense, there's nothing wrong with that, but it's a bit immature. I know they're not trying to get married, but I'm 29 (woman) and I can't even entertain the idea of wasting my time with someone anymore. Men are definitely different though. The older guys so far have done very similar things: been polite, complimented everyone based on things that weren't appearance related, and in the end went after the typical cutesy YOUNGEST girl.",

The casting is so good at finding people that are entertaining enough for this format!! \n\nI cannot learn names fast enough so im just gonna describe the people lol\n\nThe cheerleader girl reminded me of the pikachu girl in the first group but she\u2019s more chill lol I liked them both so I\u2019m happy this one might get a happy ending\u2026let\u2019s see \ud83e\udd76 \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffescreamed when I heard anti fragile I love that song so bad. And she KILLED the dance\n\nI like that the show is clearly trying to match people based on there types, I can pick out who the producers thought would work well together pretty quickly and it\u2019s always funny to see how the majority of them divert from this so call ideal type\ud83e\udd23 like the model guy was def matched for the cheerleader. I know PD say it\u2019s coincidental but they def picked the cute girl to be on the show knowing her type was the guy they had already interviewed,as her interview was after his.\n\nWhat\u2019s up with them cutting talents?\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 \u201cview them online\u201d I had a feeling the ex gymnast would do tricks and it look like she did one but I have to go somewhere else to see it ..why??\ud83e\udd23\n\nAnyways this group seem fun, had a lot of fun watching this episode. The YouTuber is absolutely hilarious and is made for this type of thing \ud83d\ude01 was worried about him and cute girl tho bc she was giving off groupie low-key in that date lmao I also thought he pressed skip like somin did cuz he didn\u2019t want to date a fan but the reason was HILAROUS. \u201cI wanted to see what she would do straight away\u201d\ud83e\udd23I\u2019m crying djhshsjss.  First time someone\u2019s been strategic with the skip button\ud83e\udd23\nRestaurant ceo lady taking her heels off to cook was so hot! She\u2019s so cool &amp; what an fun talent to show.  I love seeing something different. Cooking is def a talent but is obviously hard to show in these sorts of situations so shoutout for PD for facilitating a table and stuff for her lol I giggled when they carried it in\ud83e\udd23\n\nAnyways this cast seem fun. hoping for two couples \u203c\ufe0f",

I wouldn't be surprised if learning from/being around older people helped her become so successful in her career as well. Maybe she was drawn to other entrepreneurs who were successful who happened to be older. Which is also why i think she will only be interested in the other ceo on the show.

They also are well-rounded people who have hobbies and talents, and most importantly know what they want from a partner and know their strengths and weaknesses.  \n\nIn comparison, I was legit thinking there is nothing I can show for during a talent showcase.

If I halved the time i spent watching shows, going on reddit, and playing games on my phone, i probably would have time for another hobby or 2, but it's all abt priorities (*to some extent, for most people. Not if you're also studying or working multiple jobs or caring for family members/children. Not everyone has the luxury for hobbies.)\n\nBut anyway, i learned early on that comparing yourself to others only ends in misery. For real. There is already some 13 yo who is 10x smarter than all of us combined who is gonna change the world. There is also a 13 yo who was born into billions. You can only aim to be the best version of yourself. Getting motivation or inspiration from how others live their lives can be productive, but only if it's realistic for you given your circumstances. They are also only gonna show their best selves on a dating show! They're not gonna talk abt how many hours they spent lying down browsing youtube last week.\n\nThe idea that some careers are more legitimate than others is a social construct. Like society wouldn't function without cleaners and child care workers/educators but they don't get as much respect as CEOs.\n\nKnowing what they want from a partner and knowing their stengths and weaknesses just takes a little bit of introspection. I'm sure you can figure it out. \n\nIf you grew up in a developing country that oppresses women and you're still alive, i feel like that in itself is a pretty good outcome? Don't sell yourself short. Not everyone starts life at the same level. Some people need to work hard just to get to the starting line, while others start 2 ft from the finish line. \n\nStop feeling bad and start changing your mindset. You're ONLY in your 20s. You can do and be anything you want. Good luck!",

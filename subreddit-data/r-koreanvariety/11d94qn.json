Only the payback to the locals with random singing and dancing was missing. Packed vehicle and Na inwoo taking random photos really gave it a feel that they were going out for a fun guy-trip. \n\nThe survival game with zombie looked fun! I was half expecting the cheat code to slow down the zombies will be jongmin's song lol. Ah I miss great escape TT\n\nA random fun fact: youn Jung hoon cameoed in the kdrama love to hate you and bluntly promoted 2d1n lol. I am curious if it was an adlib from yjh or the writer is a fan of 2d1n. Kang hodong was also mentioned in the earlier episode.",

The jump scares there are pretty obvious, as in there's a lead in where the camera might focus on a spot for a long time or the music will suddenly ramp up or turn off entirely while something creepy is happening. I also don't do well with jump scares, but I think the ones in Midnight Horror Story are pretty reasonable and not excessive.",

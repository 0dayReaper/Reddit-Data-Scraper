    "postText": "**Ramyun and Chill Final Episode Update, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf9gLQWfo6U**\n\nDavid said that **Episode 5 will release in maybe 12 hours or so**.\n\nIt was delayed due to:\n\n1. They were waiting for Kickstarter to approve their fundraising campaign project for the second season. This is the primary reason as they wanted to time it with the first season's finale hype.\n\n2. Youtube's ridiculous copyright system strikes again, so some time was spent going around the music played by the housemates.\n\n3. DKDKTV is undergoing a tax audit (Korea is apparently doing this to Korean Youtubers and since Youtube is still fairly new/etc. there, they probably have to set precedents and so it's slow), so they're busy with that too.\n\nOh nice, apparently some of them went to Singapore for the networks there. Is this VIU? To maybe help make Season 2.\n\n---\n\nI'll try to help fund the second season.\n\nIt's been several years since my last Kickstarter/etc. funding. Like I only pay $1 on Patreon every month for Latte ASMR (https://www.youtube.com/c/LatteASMR/videos) as a content subscription for like half a decade now and never really anything else outside of the usual Netflix/Prime/etc. \n\nAnd the production team did really nicely with this production, hoping they do well again with the second season.\n\nYup, as somebody that also had to edit, add special effects, etc. to videos for school and so on, it's really so time-consuming. People don't know hard it is to go frame by frame sometimes to catch stuff or make things as desired. Don't know how full-time editors do it, lol.",

            "comment": "This is the current pinned comment under this update video, it might change later on:\n\n&gt; Summary: Episode 5 is ready to go, but due to the Kickstarter review process for RNC season 2, we have been waiting for it's approval - to attach the fundraiser video/URL in the last part of EP5. Our internal deadline is noon, so it will be up within 12 hrs no matter what. The delay notice was made via YouTube community post and comments on each episode, a week ago. We apologize for not announcing on social media.  \n&gt;     \n&gt; Answering the question \"Wasn't this filmed months ago or something? Why are they doing everything now and overworking themselves?\" \n&gt;     \n&gt; I know it may seem like that way, but when you have less than 3 people, especially 1 editor taking care of a project of this scale, this is what happens. We are not Netflix, we do not have a fully dedicated production team, producers, and script-writers nor any budget for editing, subtitles, color-grading, and audio. We also have to manage our personal lives as well, doing freelance jobs to earn income for us to literally enable us to be able to produce this show. When you are juggling 3 different jobs and single-handedly editing a show that has more than 15-30+ cameras per scene, delivering Kickstarter pledge perks, planning and executing watch parties, attending interviews, business pitches and investor meetings, the timeline is bound to get stretched out like this. I usually have very low self-esteem, but i can say confidently, that I am pretty proud of myself for not losing my mind and successfully finishing the production of this show. I have not enjoyed my personal life, relationships, or mundane pleasures due to this show. Maybe this may not seem believable or you may assume that it's just merely an issue of incompetence, but I am telling the honest truth from my perspective. After all, it is, the first time we have gotten out of our comfort zone to produce a big show like this, so everything is new to us. Just to give you ONE example, it took me solely two weeks to search, buy, set-up, the editing system/machine for this show, because the equipment was acting weird and once it was all set-up then it was incompatible with MAC OS, so we needed to buy multiple external hard drives with TB capacities and back-up the original files. So yes, if you want to call it unprofessional, you may, but literally, this is the first time managing a show like this and I would just like to take some self-credit in simply delivering and completing it. I could go on for the whole night with detailed stories on why it got delayed and more, but that is just a burden I would like to carry on myself in the name of learning, experience, and 'becoming professional'. For the potential season 2, I can guarantee that it can be made more entertaining, high-quality, and faster compared to S1, with all the experience earned through this time. So hope you support it if you can! Thank you for reading the long message :)",

Donating is actually a good idea because you get perks. I just wonder if in the future they will stick with kickstarter or go with a different donation website. Hopefully once kickstarter gets their act together, things will go smoothly.",

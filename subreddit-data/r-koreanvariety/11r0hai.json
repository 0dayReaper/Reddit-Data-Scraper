    "postText": "I\u2019ve been a fan of I live alone for a long time and I watch it consistently every week. I\u2019ve noticed that there are some weeks where no episodes is uploaded just like this week. I checked in the on demand site and they said that episode 496 has been cancelled. Why does this happen? I understand that it happens during holidays and other circumstances like during the itaewon halloween incident. But there will be weeks when nothing seems to be going on (or atleast nothing is being shown in the western media) and no episode is uploaded. Does anyone know what happened in korea last week which affected the i live alone broadcast? Thanks!",

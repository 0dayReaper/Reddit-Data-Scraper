The 1st was really smart in having 2-3 people push the boat from behind and everybody pushing from the sides. When you pull, you can only generate enough energy for small bursts as opposed to constant pressure and energy from pushing. Thats why they were stuck at the hooking part in the end. Especially when they didnt pull from both sides of the rope from the pulley part.",

Using your body weight and momentum to pull a 1.5 ton ship with each person being about 130-200 lbs (give or take) seems like a fairer battle than just using brute strength to push.\n\nI was really bummed when they lost--such an amazing display of willpower, strength and leadership.

            "comment": "Episode 7 and 8 are definitely the best episodes so far. \n\n\nShip Quest:\n\n* Sung-hoon's Team winning by that far ahead is insane. Best teamwork and also smart way of working. \n\n* I initially thought that the weakest team would have no chance to even complete the quest. Not only they managed to do it but to only lose by 2 minutes is amazing. They really did well to take advantage of the log part. If they had 1 or 2 better members, they would've gone through for sure.\n\nSemi-Final:\n\n* Atlas: H O L Y S H I T. Two hours of that? Crazy. Those two are monsters. I couldn't even stand still for two hours carrying nothing.\n\n* Prometheus: Complete dominance by the luger. Best strategy and execution. Miracle did well enough but the flip was not good enough, and I didn't like his push from the back at the end. \n\n* Icarus: The most one-sided victory. This is just pure domination by the ice climber. Wrestlers are strong and quick to climb, but this challenge is definitely more like marathon than sprints. Also happy to see the stuntwoman doing well.\n\n* Ouroboros: Really happy that the cross-fitter won it after conceding the Icarus to the ice climber. Strong mental fortitude. \n\n* Sisyphus: Sung-hoon surprised me, I didn't expect him to be doing that well considering that he's much older than the others. I don't know who's going to win between the last two, but they both look like monsters too.\n\n\nOverall, my favorite moments in these two episodes are how positive/supportive everyone to each other, and how the two biggest guys (strongman and bodybuilder husband) are really big softies who smile, joke, laugh a lot. \n\n\nI just love this show so much. If we ever get Season 2, I hope the participants can be of similar vibe and not too filled with clout-chasing people.",

Ive also noticed that those who\u2019ve done well in these quests- Jinhyeong in Atlas, Mincheol in Icarus, Jinyong in Prometheus, and even Sunghoon and the guy beside Sungbin in the Sisyphus challenge- they all note at some point that they\u2019re focused on \u201cwinning against themselves\u201d rather than comparing what the other contestants are doing.

But all of this amounts to a big question; what kind of last challenge will they throw at them that'll make it somewhat fair to all of them, when this challenge divides all 5 finalist on terms of what type of strength they have. So far, they've been unbalanced to a certain degree, but for the final, I really hope they can get something that, all of them can fight on a somewhat equal footing. \n\nFor your season 2 comment, it does seem like its rather popular and most equipment that they use to do the challenges doesn't look that expensive. Its mostly the places they hang around and their challenges that looks very expensive. Tons of lights, many camera angles and they must have a lot of support in the background, like the medics and the people that puts everything in place. I definitely can tell that this was very expensive to make, plus the whole season was made in 2 months during the summer. 2 months of filming people being physically fit? That's very little. I'm surprised they were able to push 9 episodes, but seeing that they were repeating the same thing happen, but from 5 different angles, that puts more time in. They could've cut it quite shorter for sure. I personally think they'll try to push for a second season with the popularity it has, but they'll probably have to cut on a lot to make it more profitable. \n\nMy biggest fear, that I'm pretty sure will happen is, since it got very popular, lots of people will apply compared to last time, now that'll cost a lot of time and money to filter all those people. Because of that, the quality of the cast will definitely drop, imo.",

Icarus is also his best chance of winning out of the 5 challenges. He acknowledged that the mountain rescue guy is the one he wanted to avoid, implying that mountain rescue guy is probably the favorite overall. In the end, he simply didn't realize the huge gap of endurance between them. Props that he openly admitted he had no chance to win at the end.",

The other two also probably had an advantage since they've both competed in strongman events in the past and the challenge might be similar to stuff they've done.

Body builders aren't as strong as strongmen or power lifters relative to their size, but they're still pretty strong.

That one lady who volunteered for the Atlas challenge, and the one guy who wanted the rope challenge but knew the ice climber is better suited. Also the guy who won rock paper scissors but knew that the rock paper scissors loser had a really good chance to win in another challenge.\n* I thought the Nippert would do better in the Prometheus challenge. In the Moving Sand challenge, he crossed the bridge in 3 strides.\n* Ever since watching Ultimate Beastmaster, I knew that climbers are the ones to watch out for. When they announced the Icarus challenge, I knew for sure that the ice climber would advance. The only thing that could stop him is someone from his own team\n* The 5 challenges are quite creative. Love them, except maybe the Prometheus challenge was a bit underwhelming.\n* I suppose F\\*\\*\\*! is a swear word in Korean as well? I thought Koreans had their own version of it, but Miracle deferred to the English version",

So respectable and what a class act.\n\nLastly Choo Sung Hoon is really so commendable. He never fails to remind the rest to have fun and stay safe. It is so easy to be competitive and go over your head when it comes to these competitions. Him as an elder and more senior to the rest always keeps levelheaded and his reminders to the rest through out the series makes me respect him so much.",

Think about Hong Bom Seok or Agent H (UDT guys who got eliminated in the death match), they are definitely strong competitors for lated rounds (I think Hong Bom Seok might have won the Ouroborus if he had the chance, this guy runs like crazy), but they lost earlier. I guess this is the whole idea of the show, to see who has the most well-rounded physical body to survive different tests, and with a bit of luck. \n\nbtw I've been rooting for the climber since the beginning as climbers have crazy endurance and can utilize bursts of energy to make dynamic movements as well, so happy that he can advance to final round. I'm also rooting for Sungbin. I thought he was arrogant but actually he seems shy in front of many people, he's really funny in his youtube videos.",

Then I found out the show is affiliated with MBC....maybe the same location they film ISAC?\n\nSung-Bin's adapting of his technique during the Sisyphus challenge was interesting, actually watching everyone adapt is what makes the show fun as a spectator.",

            "comment": "Honestly quite sad Jang Eun-sil team got out, really good effort and honestly surprising how little the lost by considering their team composition! Rooting for Jo Jin! Big man and really cute personality and smile! Ever since round one it was so interesting to me how he fought the odds against the other supposed quick guy in Arena A. AND him standing for 2 hours with that rock unwaveringly? That is so beyond amazing, I can't even imagine standing for 2 hours straight with my arms up. Hats off to him and Kim Sik\n\nThis might be kind of toxic but I felt like having individual quests after 2 rounds of team quests start to highlight which individual doesn't really contribute all that much/isn't as outstanding as they think they are. Not saying that they don't deserve top 20, heck most of them are absolute beasts, but what really stood out to me was Ki-kwan, that body builder. Body-builders in this show did seem to have really great physiques, abs at such high bodyweight? No one can say they don't put in the work. But what ticked me off was this Ki-kwan dude always making comments about how his team is a sure win etc. when he himself wasn't really that much of a \"carry\" so to say. Iron Man YSB is a definite all rounder, there's a reason his team also gathers some pretty strong guys, but IMO that's what makes Cha Hyun Seung much more likeable to me also, doesn't really make too many declarations of confidence, keeps humble because he knows that while he's quite physically fit, his team of 5 composed of others who may contribute more than him in the team quests. Ki-kwan mentioning him not having a single quest that he could take/his performance on the Prometheus quest was exactly what I suspected - he probably wouldn't have gotten this far had he not had such a strong team.",

            "comment": "Haven't seen anyone mention this but the Ouroboros game looks deceivingly like a physical game but there is actually a major luck element in play.\n\nIf the second or third strongest runner is positioned behind the strongest runner in the beginning, the strongest runner have almost no chance of winning unless he outpaces them by a whole lap to win the guy behind him. In this case it is not even about technique or strategy (i.e. in the Icarus game), it is sheer luck or lack thereof since they didn't get to choose their positions. The only way the strongest runner can win without running one full lap more than every other competitor is if he and the second strongest runner are one man away from each other, or if he is behind the second strongest runner.\n\nIn this case, Woo Jin Young (winner) was in the best position to win the game. He had the optimal position of being behind the strongest runner (or at the very least they were on par in terms of stamina and speed) and in front of the weakest runner (the guy with the broken rib). Therefore they all caught the one before them before getting caught themselves.",

If you have a bad match up (like the case in episode 8) where two of the best runners were next to each other, the one behind gets an insane advantage by being way closer to tagging. Even if the person behind was fairly slower and has less endurance, tactically he would still be favored to win. They should have restarted all the players once someone is tagged out to be even lengths.",

    "postText": "I was wondering what your guys position was on the new physical 100 pairings of contestants for challenges?\n\nIve noticed a lot of people commenting on how unfair the matches are between the men and women as well as the differences in professions. A big example being the MMA fighters in the first challenge being crucified for using to much technique.\n\nAt the end of the day their can only be one winner right so why would you want to categorise each contestant based on their build. Isn\u2019t part of the competition also a way of finding the best foundation sport in the process for these competition?\n\nJust wondering what yours guys thoughts are?",

            "comment": "I think its very hard to make the show balanced because even with just the concept of the show, you can already expect that there will be a huge gap between male/female participants. Sports are sex-segregated and we also have to account for the different weight classes which just make things more complicated for whoever is running things behind the scenes, because they still have to make sure that the show also gets views. \n\nLike how does one create a well balanced challenge that gives **A.)** both sexes the chance of coming on top, **B.)** considers different weight classes and accounts for them, and **C.)** has to be entertaining to watch.",

While this could be entertaining, I could also see that it can lack the climax in a sense that the overall winner might've never won a single challenge. But this is basically like how Tour de France works, you can be the overall winner without ever winning any stage.",

It's not even about men and women in this case. The male wrestler picked a massive opponent but everyone, including his opponent already knew who would win this thing. \nIt was visually impressive but the prison guard was thrown around for show-value and had to hope he won't get injured. \nWrestler could have picked and taken out anyone. MMA guys, boxers - they can't punch him, they can only fight him at what he is good at. Pretty lame. \n\nIf anything, they should at least have done the first quest later.",

But it is not to find strongest body or most superior body, nor most skillful or agile or whatever. \n It would certainly be possible and some sports already do that to certain excent in more systematic manner where you need to be good in more than just one thing. For example, olympic decathlon tests variety of athletic skills. Biathlon in winter sports is an interesting example combing skiing and shooting. Anyway, these are just examples. You could imagine different set of tests to determine who is strongest, or having most superior physique. In effecf you'd have to be good in more than one thing. \nIt is a game and fun show basically. Doesn't prove or disprove anything.\nI actually don't like that after quest 1 so many interesting characters are gone already. In particular lack of clarity on rules is also a bit lacking. The guy who put the knee on woman should have been kicked out or disqualified. That was just such a dirty move. Or if not, why boxers or martial artists couldn't punch? MMA fighters went for real fight and suddenly it was allowed?! And unbelievably dangorous in both arenas. One wrong flip and your neck goes on that metal fence and you can be the strongest but in comma or disabled for the rest of life. \nAlso how they were making the teams out was incredibly unfair. The woman in 10th position got the weakest team. Three women ended up in last team. This could have been so much more balanced. And not her fault. I'm so hoping they won in that contest. Got to wait for next episode to find out.\nOverall I like how enertain it is to watch but there is space for improvements making it as enertaining and perhaps a bit more fair or balanced. Otherwise in future rounds women might not ever want to join it.",

It will be never be 100% fair since the pool of talent is very diverse. Additionally they also need to have different type of matches/games in order to make it entertaining.  \n\n\nMy main issue with the show is that so far the rules seems not thorough or detailed enough in both games, both in ensuring the safety of the contestants and ensuring everyone actually knows the extent they can do physically to triumph.   \n\n\nI would much prefer a full on explanation on the rules to the contestant and to the audience. I find Running Man and other variety comedy shows do better job at explaining the rules of their games than this show.  \n\n\nThat being said,  I would guess the showrunners are expecting a certain sense of pride and sportsmanship between the contestants too, but then there is one active MMA fighter guy that actually chose a woman to have an easier time. smh",

All the contestants knew what they were getting into, and if there is a parkour event or relay race, some of those giant dudes will fall like flies.\n\nI do agree with sentiments that the one of one matches seem extra rough if a strong man chose a woman, but I only noticed 2 of those that were man vs woman. Maybe there were more, but it mostly seemed like the women fighting each other. \n\nEdit: (Apparently there were 5 MvW)\n\nA lot of physical competition shows (like ultimate beastmaster) are co-ed, and the reality is you never know what will give someone the advantage. People can talk biology all they want, but it seems like there will be a huge variety of events on this show.\n\nThe only complaint I have is actually that cheerleader girl. There are plenty of athletic and competitive cheerleaders, but they just showed her half-heartedly cheering at a baseball game, and she had zero muscle. I didn't understand the point of having her there.",

A lot of youtube content creation in the Korean fitness community is driven by mutual growth, ie. guesting in each other's programs, promoting each other's niche/personalities, sharing and growing each other's audience together. No one really wants to mingle with a dude that seemingly has no principles or respect for others. If he was just hell bent on winning the prize money, he could've won quickly without resorting to these weird negative theatrics.\n\nHe paid for it in the end; he got passed on in every single team for the 2nd quest mission. So in the end with his shithousery he reduced the probability of him winning the entire tournament, and simultaneously destroyed his image in front of some of the biggest fitness content creators in Korea.  \n\nThough I guess he gains notoriety, and Koreans are talking about what a loser he is so I guess he could leverage that in the future maybe. Negative exposure is still better than no exposure I guess. However this is all assuming everything is unscripted. The editing and theatrical nature of the show also makes things dubious.",

Also, quite a few women made it to the next round because they chose other women. Its kind if annoying that a few of the best women chose to take on hard challenges by not only picking men into the sand pit but picking some of the better physiques at the whole tournament. Like there was one girl that passed because she picked a skinnier guy and the guy wasn\u2019t willing to fight a girl.\n\nI also think the mission on the 4th episode was pretty good. It looked like the team of misfits actually have a shot at winning since its been mostly tied the whole time. The sand mission is good because you basically have big guys tiring theirself out by taking big loads, while the smaller people are abusing their endurance and taking more trips with less weight and its easier for them to cross the bridge because of this. Its like the classic grocery bag dilemma, the best method is to make two trips bring the grocery bag in from the car but every man tries to take them all in at the same time anyway and tires theirself out.\n\nI think part of the reason people feel this way is because a lot of the girls that passed didn\u2019t do it in an impressive fashion so they got like a 1 second clip of them passing, where all the girls that lose got minutes of airtime showing their struggle against hard opponents.\n\nIts kind of a weird thing to complain about in my opinion though because this challenge parodies squid game, these games aren\u2019t a tournament to figure out who is the strongest. These games are determining who is the smartest, who is the best at adapting, who\u2019s got that dog in them, and most importantly who is lucky, because luck is a big factor. There were so many monsters that have already been sent home, so complaining about the girls is weird. Its not a fair game for anyone on the show. Let the girls have some time to shine and maybe we will get lucky and go deep.",

Performing better in the hanging challenge gave contestants an \"advantage.\" That advantage is the ability to pick an opponent of your choice. Does it not make sense that the people who pushed themselves to the limit to do better in Game 0 (gymnast) would have more advantage than someone who took it easy and dropped after 5 seconds because they did not care about the advantage (zombie guy)? It makes sense that the people at the bottom of the ranking would get less choice in the next game because they failed to do better in the \"advantage\" challenge, therefore leaving them: disadvantaged.",

It's actually much easier to come up with fairer event that is individual challenge than actually having individual compete.

Of course it's unfair, like how can they expect a heavyweight wrestler to hang from a bar longer than a mountain climber? But the fun part is just watching the contestants work their way through unexpected challenges. \n\nI think the women are doing a lot better than people expected. That famous youtuber Euddeum lasted on the hanging bar until the top ten if I remember and one of ladies getting voted in as captain shows how much respect the other contestants have for her.\n\nHonestly, I don't see a huge gap. There might be more challenges in other rounds where it's advantageous to be be lighter/smaller in build. The whole premise of the show is kind of vague... finding the \"perfect body?\" There is no basis or criteria to it at all. From what I can tell, the main aim of the show just seems to be promoting Korean athletes or fitness youtubers.",

For speed/power/endurance challenges one group will always be at an advantage no matter how they mix and match the challenges.\n\nA cumulative performance on different challenges might balance it out, they just have to find the right amount of points to give for each one e.g. lifting 300 kgs = 100 pts, running a 1 km lap in 4 mins = 100 points, etc which means a lot of simulation on the production's part. But then they still have to account for female participants.\n\nI think they found the most entertaining route though i agree that the head to head is problematic. The team challenges are needed since they need to cut the numbers down except they should add an elimination round for the losing group members to compete against each other in a deatchmatch to determine who survives another day.",

A game that deals with picking up huge objects puts a calisthenics athlete at a huge disadvantage in the first round without ever showing what they are capable of.

Pirate boat easily moved in 13 min with small girls and smaller guys vs team of bodybuilder and other large guys who \"are stuck\" at the end and cannot budge the ship - time 19 minutes. The boat either had a brake applied or weighed down. Rocks of different weights. Finale where one guys is so far ahead then suddenly cannot budge the wheel even with the hardest effort. Its not a real competition but a game show, fixed for ratings.",

Eventually they close the gap and pass them, eliminating them. Now the guy in front needs to make up 3/4 lap to catch the guy behind him, but the guy behind only needs to make up a quarter lap to win. This makes zero sense.",

For instance, where they had to hold up 40% of their weight in their bust was an instance where they did make it fair for women. The ship challenge was just unfair, they could have adjusted the ship's weight according to weight of contestants, same with the rock challenge. They could have added more balance/agility/mental strength/accuracy shooting challenges as well. Women tend to hold a lot of strength in their legs, but many challenges were about strength in the upper body. There were so many strong and amazing women contestants who just didn't stand a chance because the show was skewed towards men. I stopped watching part way through due to this.",

            "comment": "If they wanted to make it an actual contest of physicality, then all elements of physicality should have been tested. For instance, balance, flexibility, mental fortitude, fine motor skills. Instead, the game was mainly about brute strength with some parts about mental fortitude. It was also sexist in that it was set up for male bodies and strengths ie focussing on the upper body when many women are strong mentally/flexible/have stronger lower bodies. For real levelling, they should have done more like adjust the weight according to the body ie the ship should have been adjusted like the torsos were for the holding 40% of your weight comp. when those things were done, you could see the women hold their own and many were often in the top few/winners of those games. If they wanted to make it just about male strength or testosterone based physicality, then just have males in the game.  Also, some of the males were unnecessarily nasty towards the women in the game, like the MMA guy who pinned that woman with his knee repeatedly. There was definitely an element of nasty sexism in the game, which likely reflects korean society.",

The main game consists of listening to a song and determining the correct lyrics for a part of it while employing different hints to get closer to the solution. Every failed attempt means more food for YouTube mukbang star Small-mouthed Haetnim. During Snack Time a different game each week determines who gets to try a snack representing this week's market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Host**\n\n* Boom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Shin Dong-yeop\n* Kim Dong-hyun\n* Moon Se-yoon\n* Park Narae\n* Hanhae\n* Key\n* Nucksal\n* Taeyeon\n* Haetnim\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Guests**\n\n* Hwang Je Seong\n* Monika\n* Layone\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**One Shots**\n\n|Member|2023|Overall|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Key|2|96|\n|Seyoon|3|79|\n|Hanhae|6|64|\n|P.O\\*|0|56|\n|Nucksal|3|50|\n|Hyeri\\*|0|49|\n|Narae|2|41|\n|Taeyeon|1|21|\n|Shin Dongyeob|1|16|\n|Donghyun|0|15|\n|Haetnim|0|1|\n\n\\*\\*updated based on Wiki'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Subtitles**\n\n|**Stream**|Link|\n|:-|:-|\n|Streaming site|[Viu](https://www.viu.com/ott/ph/en/vod/2096134/Amazing-Saturday-2023)|\n\n**Source**\n\n\\*Viu\n\n^(\\*you can still support @/dareumi from all the subtitle works they had done for the community by donating through -)  [^(ko-fi.com/dareumi)](https://ko-fi.com/dareumi) \\+",

I had to replay it so many times lol\n\nAnw, congratulations to &gt;!Hanhae, could tell he was really nervous because him getting the 1 shot always ends in misery!&lt;. Also &gt;!Donghyun's team kill was too funny!&lt; lol and he was too excited too about finally knowing a song",

Like I watched the recent Knowing Bros with SNL cast as guests and they had such good teamwork and weren't overbearing. It was actually the KB team that felt too much during the episode",

Almost to the level of RM cast but their lack of a woman member with wit (like JSM) is one of its cons.\n\nThe biggest thing I\u2019ve noticed is despite what\u2019s asked of the cast to do, they do not complain anywhere close to the RM cast. Is it because of the PD? Is it because Kim Jong Min is so easy going while being the longest tenured cast member? Dindin seems to be the biggest complainer but he\u2019s nowhere near as bad as any of the RM OGs\n\nAnd Na In Woo is probably the nicest and most patient variety show member I\u2019ve ever seen on TV. Is he acting or is that really his personality?\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to catching up as I\u2019m getting close to when they add the 6th member\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve now become a huge Moon Se Yoon fan. He\u2019s really charismatic and polished.",

It was normal for members to be left behind. The current season of the show has toned down alot. \nI kind of get why there's no woman member because of how brutal the show gets, i.e going into ice cold water in winter, literally not eating for the whole duration of the shoot if you lose all the challenges, sleeping outside no matter the weather. And maybe because in certain situations, like when they had to camp out in the snow, having a woman member would be harder in terms of changing clothes , just my opinion. The current line-up of members are huge softies and maybe they might feel sorry for the female member?\nBut I'd like if they were thinking of doing so, why not make a new show with an all female cast. It worked with Invincible Youth(tanked in mid of 2nd season as newer member came in though.) This was a show with a different concept, although it looked pretty hard as well.",

It\u2019ll probably be a while til they invite peeps just cuz of the new addition but it\u2019s been getting close to the ruthlessness and fun of the previous iterations. The cast dynamic is definitely not the same as before with the young ones\u2019 personalities but they work well with the growing involvement of the production team. I look forward to the next time the cast invites their friends and hope they get a big group during that special.",

The fact that all of them were also new to the show except for Kim Jong-Min, and Bang PD is a woman made them less likely to complain publicly. (It's been implied that Moon Se-Yoon and her had some intense meetings a few months in, but nothing confirmed.)\n\nThe boys have joked about this, as well. It's fairly common for guests to be told that \"they've tamed us.\" \n\nThe boys have seemed more likely to get testy with Lee PD because his style is closer to earlier seasons, and now \\*he\\* is the newbie.",

Whether that was chugging disgusting drinks as punishments, getting woken up early to round up other members, completing ridiculous missions, they just went along. These days it feels like they argue and complain with the PD about rules and cheat on simple drawing games. It makes the games feel meaningless and takes you out of the show.",

In one of the episodes in S4, one of the 2D1N members was thinking about throwing a game because it will make for a funny scene. Bang PD stopped him and told him to play to win. \n\n2D1N games may be simple but the fact that everyone plays to win and that the stakes matter means they are much more enjoyable to watch. Hilarious moments are more organic compared to when players throw the game just to make a scene funny (like what happens in RM a LOT).\n\nAnd when players do throw in 2D1N, it makes it even funnier because of how extremely rarely they do it.",

It is a brutal show that many PDs already left because it's physically taxing and difficult to shoot given they have to shoot mostly outdoors.\n\nIt's a \"wild variety show\" and if you wonder how wild it is, Season 1 cast got stranded in the mountains in the middle of a blizzard. That's how brutal it was. Even in season 4, already considered mild, they have slept underground, inside a cave and on top of the mountain on the coldest day of the year. The guys can also get so competitive and play rough at times. Heck, Youn Jung Hoon broke his finger on his first week. Putting a female entertainer on the show just for the banter and not considering the physical toll they could go through? Not worth it. It will also ruin the dynamics of the show because they have to be considerate with the female cast in every trip. But having female guests from time to time makes the show more fun. The female friends special in S3 and having Hyeri in S4 were fun episodes.\n\nAs for complaints, S4 games and punishments are far more reasonable than previous seasons. I just don't see the point of complaining too much - it's not fun. Rather than complaining, they negotiate instead - I like it better that way. Though one of the funniest bits of this show was when S3 cast ran away during one of their summer special. They didn't complain. They just took off and get their car's AC fixed without telling the staff. lol",

While rm is mostly game based and thrives on cast interaction, 2d1n is focused on the public's reception. \n\nIn fact, 2d1n was so much relatable to the public that s1 singlehandedly increased the local tourism by inspiring them to go out in trips in groups and play random games for food and transport and keeping things enjoyable. So interacting with the locals has always been an important aspect of this show (watch pre covid episodes for reference, preferably s3 or s1). \n\nI am not a regular viewer of rm, so far from what I have watched, recent episodes don't have the same thrill as the previous ones. They mostly seem to rely on the cast interaction and banter while the old episodes were heavily action based. Personally, I enjoyed the older episodes most so I think the shift in the concept made the ratings drop. \n\nSame for 2d1n. Although s4 is too tamed down and rarely has the wild aspects, it still follows the original concept. Which is why it still managed to have double digit ratings albeit a lot less than in previous seasons. Personally, I enjoyed the s3 the most and though the present cast is great, tbh they are no way close to the s3 cast's awesomeness. So I am sticking in as the show is still fun and the cast grew on me. \n\n\n**Tldr:** change in original concept affected viewership.",

The members still go through it, but it\u2019s nice to see game losers not actually starve; frankly the punishment meals are a lot funnier than knowing the members just don\u2019t eat anything but digestive medicines to work through starvation. \n\nThat being said Lee PD\u2019s regime has seen a return to, for lack of a better word, fucking the members over (promising rewards that actually turn out to be punishments, for example). But it\u2019s fairly early on to see just how much the show will shift back to the previous seasons of really grinding the members. \n\nAs for complaints, 1N2D members certainly do complain, as their show is arguably physically harder than RM - RM generally wraps in a day and food is guaranteed (often from PPL), for one thing. But given the concept of 1N2D everyone involved also knows what they signed up for, so the level of good-natured needling you\u2019d see on RM wouldn\u2019t happen; when the 1N2D members are unhappy with what\u2019s going on, it pretty much amps up to 10 or 11 by default. Also the 1N2D members are less popular and less experienced than the RM cast, and less close to their staff; their vibe with the staff is going to be very different than YJS, KJK, et al with their staff. RM has had the same cast for 14 years, and their relationship with their staff and what they do on RM is just very different all around than 1N2D.",

They have an unspoken rule that no matter what they play a bullshit minigame so the other members can share food. \n\nI\u2019m not saying they have to go as far as making them starve, but I think the food they eat should at least not be enjoyable. Like what if the PD is a bad cook or anyone on their staff is a bad cook. Have a couple clips of them trying their hardest to cook something good for the losers and messing it up. Then you could have a wonderful moment where the person who lost is the winner on the one day the bad cook actually managed to make something good. That way they can banter with the crew more. They could also do it like Earth Arcade where there is stakes, but the difference is that they don\u2019t get to choose the food, if they fail none of the cast gets to eat it, so they could actually have passion to win certain foods and be upset when they fail, but realistically there are so many games that they will probably end up eating something, and on a rare occasion they could show a behind the scenes where they were so bad at the games that they really skipped a meal, and be transparent with the next one that the crew is really trying to give them softballs so they can eat something. \n\nThe episodes of 1D2N are too damn long for them to have absolutely no stakes.",

            "comment": "I've been an avid fan of both shows since basically their first episodes. In the beginning, I preferred RM due to the many activities with the public, the creativity of the themes, and how the punishments were more comedic than harsh. 2D1N was interesting to me, but I never quite warmed to it the same way until the cast change. \n\nSince s4 of 2D1N and since Gary's departure from RM (and thus the change in format), I've very much shifted to preferring 2D1N over RM. I believe Moon Se Yoon and Bang PD's \"negotiations\" had a huge impact on the lack of harshness in the new seasons (which I really enjoy the new healing factor). Bang PD wanted a different kind of chemistry and cast well, and Moon Se Yoon seemed to be very adamant about there should be no one going without a meal leading to the new good meal vs sad meal approach which is much better for everyone. The cast also just seems more willing to jump in and try anything like RM used to do before they got too comfortable and before solo fans started launching complaints any time a member was mildly inconvenienced. \n\nI also think that adding a woman to the cast of 2D1N would really ruin it unless they had a very specific type of woman (like Jihyo in the early years of RM when they would treat her like one of the guys 90% of the time and she could hold her own physically in the games). I'm not here for bantering in shows being the main focus. I much prefer when it's just added in for fun. \n\nRM meanwhile...I don't get where everyone is saying that the cast chemistry is better than ever. They had great chemistry before and did it with games and not just sitting down and talking. At this point to me the complaints they have are because there's nothing else for them to talk about really and because apparently people really like it as part of the \"banter\".  I remember when BoPil was PD was of the main things his fans seemed to like was when he and the cast would go back and forth about the rules or whatever (which I'm sorry, but that was the dullest part of the show for me listening to them just argue on and on). However, it now seems to be a part of the new concept of the show.",

                            "comment": "It's interesting to me because RM was built on international viewers. While they initially didn't do well at all with domestic ratings, international fans loved the old format, loved seeing Korean food and landmarks, loved the campy style, and loved the guests and interactions with the public. It's really what set the show apart and drew in fans who didn't go for the other Korean variety shows that relied on talking. Now that the show can really afford to capitalize off the international demographic with the rise of legal streaming services, they've strangely chosen to instead go with the banter format aimed toward domestic fans. No more cultural episodes, no landmarks, and almost no interactions with the public. It's a bummer to see the show be completely revamped and a lot of the old fans dropping it and trying to find a replacement. \n\nAt least for the cast though there seem to be a decent amount of new fans for the new format and a few of the old ones seem to have remained (none in most of my circles though), so I guess I'll take it for what it is and just accept that my RM is gone and at least I have 2D1N and some other variety shows now popping up.",

They don't need to force gags or overreactions compared to RM. If they need that extra laughter or content Kim Jong-min easily provides that. Also, one thing I want to point out is that 2D1N compared to RM is they don't over-replay the same cut scene over and over again.",

Female entertainers have appeared on some really harsh K variety shows. Just off of the top my head there was Law of the Jungle, or even some early Running Man episodes (e.g. peddling across the Han river in the dead of winter?). Also women don't necessarily have to receive special treatment or that guys have to be constantly considerate. For example, Lee Kwangsoo and Song Jihyo pulling each other's hair as they fight are some of the funniest bits in RM of the past.\n\nAdding a female member -- or any member -- to 1N2D probably isn't a good idea now that members have good chemistry together. Why add someone to potentially disrupt that? But things like \"a female member can't stand the brutality of the show\" or \"guys will then constantly have to be considerate\" are just awful reasons.",

Has Jihyo climbed mountains with 20kg backpack in RM like they did in 1N2D season 3? These are recurring themes in the show. Point is, the format of these shows you've mentioned made it easier for a female member to stay longer in the show. The show's 15-yr history only had one female PD and zero female cast - there's a reason for that - just like no female contestant made it to Physical 100 finals.\n\nPlus core audience are different. 1N2D appeals to the older demographic. If childish hair pulling with the opposite sex is funny to younger RM watchers, that would probably not appeal to 1N2D viewers.",

Watch the 1st season season of the show, and you would know how brutal it was. This show was a template for all the shows that came after. \n\nThis show put Na PD on the map. And he has mellowed alot from when he did 2D1N. They were secretly fiming the members and making sure that they were not eating in between  filming breaks. So, if you lost all the bokbulbok games, you won't eat. No gimmicks. And it even made it hard for them to cast guests because people didn't want to come on the show. \n\nLike I said, why not make a totally new show for females. You've got to understand that all the cast members were normal people(untrained celebrities) going through sufferings after sufferings while of course, introducing places in Korea. This was what made the show so popular.",

He made me laugh a few times - especially when he shows his experience with games haha\n\nFrom a avid RM fan, the only thing I was disappointed was with the 2d1n games. To start with, some are very specific and you can't really follow to the point of finding it funny. But they just play and get it done with, I can't even laugh at it. Especially because, as the show was not exactly funny to me (it seemed more like a comfort show), I expected a bit more from the games. But yeah... \n\nWhile in RM you have cheaters and they all tease each other, and even word games seem fun (they use the same 2d1n games but make it fun, like, they have to call each others some teasing names and create reactions and such..), here the games were not so fun, at least until some months ago. Which made me love Dindin a lot more. He's the one who always makes me laugh with his antics (he's teasing is so annoying tho, you can't help wishing this brat to lose xD). And SY as well. If not, the games they play just go unnoticed - except the flour game. That was soo funny. \n\nBuuut, I feel the show and its games are more entertaining now, after the pd changed. I don't like the \"leaving 1 behind\" theme, but overall I feel I laugh so much more recently, and I love it. I was never into 2d1n because I didn't find it funny aka connected with the cast . The s04 was the first I managed to enjoy, as a comfort show, but somehow I enjoy it a lot more now. I feel the cast is very well chosen, and I still can't understand Jung Hoon's sudden glow. Out of sudden, he got so funny, talkative and great. I was not expecting this entertainer aura of him.",

    "postText": "I'm really loving the positive vibes with this show. I love how all the girls are excited to participate and have to earn everything they want/need. I'm looking for any other shows where the cast needs to earn their stuff, cook their own foods, etc. Preferably with English subtitles.  \nI'm trying watching \"Village Survival, The Eight\", but I do prefer newer shows and shows where the games are more fun/modern and the survival/earn stuff aspect is a bit stronger.   \n\n\nI like HyeMiLeeYeChaePa because its giving me the fun BlackPink house had mixed with a goal based earn your way challenge. Thank You!",

If you are looking for all-female cast, the golden standard is Unnies/Unnies Slamdunk (there are two seasons, mostly different cast per season but both are cool imho).\n\nAlthough, they aren't really in this format.\n\nEdit: Although, there was a relatively recent variety show with Narae that is also all-female. \"Gamsung camping\".",

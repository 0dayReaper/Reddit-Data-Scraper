    "postText": "Stumbled upon JJY PD's Instagram account and saw the [promotional video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/ClD-pNYpjXX/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) for his upcoming show on Netflix named \"Devil's Plan\".  You can see Jinho, Dongmin, and others in the video. According to his Instagram the show was shot for 7 days in January, but couldn't find information on broadcasting dates. \n\nUnfortunately it seems that we will not get TGE or DTCU universe anymore. But anyway eagerly waiting for his new shows and new universe that he is planning.",

Although a TGE production is questionable, I've heard him talking about how he's planning on producing GHSMC after Devil's Plan is published. Of course, things might have changed since back then, it was only a few months after he joined TEO, but I'm hoping for good news *especially* since he still interacts with all of the girls on Insta. \n\nIt also makes sense since the show was on TVING so it might have different rights than a pure TVN show. Taeho PD has also made some TVING shows after making his own company, hence the likely possibility.",

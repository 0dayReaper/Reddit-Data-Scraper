            "comment": "Great episode! Cha Tae-hyun is one of those rare \"carry\" guests that can be the highlight of the entire episode. I'm glad it was entertaining enough for 1.5 episodes worth. Chae Tae-hyun was hilarious with his antics as usual. Sometimes it looked like he checked out, just sitting there and not doing anything, but overall he knew exactly what to do to be funny. Sukjin is the highlight of this entire episode for me. He took over the master position, got incredibly rich, then lost it all to Jaesuk at the very end lmao. Sukjin also used the roulette wheel like a fortune teller and used it (poorly) to find out who did crimes lol. Jihyo was way too passive imo, which explained why she had so many coins at the end. Everyone else was gambling, stealing, and trying to fight for power and she just kinda stood in the back and cooked. She needs to know that failing in variety often means winning (ie. Kwangsoo).\n\nAnd then we get into the special Sukjin meal segment. That was also great. Sukjin is arguably the weakest member who's basically a cranky guy that acts scummy yet, that's what everyone loves about him. Imo, I'd rank him as #2 most entertaining RM member behind Jaesuk. It just speaks volumes to how you don't have to be the strongest or the smartest to be good at variety. Even his flamboyant clothing choices are used to purposely draw attention and be made fun of, not because he's seriously dressing up that way. He's enjoying his life. In any case, it was awesome to see the members so happy and Sukjin sweating thinking about having to pay for the gigantic meal for RM and the staff. When they did the roulette and Sukjin INDEED had to pay for everything, that was hilarious. Jaesuk was so happy that he couldn't stop dancing. I also have to praise Jaesuk for never losing a step. You'd think after being variety king for so many years, he'd have a drop off, nope, he's only gotten better. He just has too much skill, variety sense, and is loved by all. He's the pillar of Running Man.",

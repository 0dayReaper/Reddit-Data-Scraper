    "postText": "I just stumbled upon this show yesterday on Netflix and really enjoyed the first 5-6 episodes. Are there other shows similar in concept or sports shows that I should watch?\n\nI see there is a show called Kick a Goal. Trying to see where I can watch this. Is this a similar show?\n\nAny other recommendations?",

They bring in coaches that used to play for the National Korean Soccer Team to train them and they play against each other. It's fun to watch cause you will start rooting for a team you like and see new faces in the entertainment industry that foreigners aren't used to seeing.",

If you don't mind men being involved there is a show called \"Gentlemen's League\" on Netflix where they take either retired or already established national athletes from other sports and make an amateur soccer team out of them.  It's a variety show so it has that same vibe.  There is also a very similar baseball show using retired baseball players called\" a clean sweep\" on Netflix too.  Oh and there is a female celeb baseball one called Witches I believe.  It's no longer running but it's only a few years old.",

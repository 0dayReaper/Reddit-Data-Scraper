I was taking my time to try and give this episode the quality subs it deserves, for being especially Genius-like, but I guess time flew by quickly. The next few eps should be much more manageable in terms of time, but please enjoy\\~\n\n**Magnet**: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:be16027730ea5531575eb8730f46d1334ef487ad\n\n(Thanks to u/SVNBob for grabbing the shortened version, it just didn't seem to work for me for some reason.

But i do wish that they'd focus more on puzzle solving and having to figure things out instead of spending 30 mins gambling!&lt;",

Right now he has the great reputation of \"a celebrity who knows a lot about fitness/strength\" without him claiming as one himself, and he's respected for it. If he does well in a competitive show, he doesn't gain much (and at the same time, the more serious athlete/military/fitness professionals could lose massive reputation for being beaten by a singer). But if he does poorly, he'd immediately lose a lot of reputation (i.e.: \"oh he's just all talk and he's nothing compared to real professionals\"). \n\n\nWe already see a bit of this with soccer/football. He's knowledgeable in theory, but his actual skill is not up to par. He isn't as good compared to what he talks about. It's generally accepted well anyway because people don't really take his soccer/football seriously. The expectation on fitness/physical competition would be on a different level though.",

The guy is very enthusiastic but even when younger was like a rhino with asthma.   Same with most guys who do power events, the extra muscle comes with a loss of speed and flexibility.  Of course you get genetic outliers like the Pacific Islanders.\n\nThe gym bunnies will look great on power events but totally blown out when they try to run.  Any contestants who play Rugby or American football should do well, they usually front load on muscle training then focus on running when the season start.",

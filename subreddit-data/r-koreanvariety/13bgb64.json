It was quite a bloody sight.\n\nPS: Please watch this episode and tell me your opinion on how Yong Sik played the game. It seems to me that he scored the goal as he was standing in that location at the right place and the right time thus it became easy for him to score the goal.\n\nThroughout the match, he only showed up when he made the score. unlike some of the players who really ran hard and their efforts are evident.\n\nChilgu made a number of errors for this match during passes.                                                 \n\nGood luck Eojjeoda Avengers.",

            "comment": "Throughout the auditions Coach Ahn was adamant about picking a target striker to balance out Namgyu, and that's exactly what he got. I understand there's going to be talk about Kim Yong Sik getting \"easy goals\" but as Lee Donggook said himself this episode, it's not a free goal if it's good positioning. And that's the bread and butter of a target striker: being at the right place at the right time and having a good finish. \n\nAs for the rest of the offensive lineup, having Yong Sik as a striker brings the rest of them alive. With GyuGyu (Namgyu especially) having less pressure to deliver now that Yong Sik is another option, I think we're going to see a lot more creative plays from them. I also noticed that Namgyu isn't so lonely pressing the opponents now that he has Yong Sik and Junyi to go along with him.\n\nAs for the rest of the team, great defensive effort! Other than Chilgu having half a mind this match (I think he's one of the team's key players but this match just wasn't it), the back line did a good job clearing instead of creating potentially dangerous situations. Kunkyu still needs to learn how to control the pace of the game though, he hurries his passes and doesn't allow the team to breathe. Meanwhile, Donghyun completely forgot how to call and almost caused a collision with Jangkun. yikes.\n\nAnd Lee Jihwan's cross was magic! I hope to see more of him and more of that confidence on the field. I hope he got his assist money from Namgyu, lol",

            "comment": "For Kim Yong Sik, I'm a bit sceptical about him. Looks like the coaches doesnt ask much of him except for being in a good position and scores lots of goals. He didn't participate much in building the attack or defensing during the opponent's corner kick either. More like a baby, always need to be fed. Looks like we have a favourite child in the house now. (Yes, I'm a bit bitter about him, sorry about that). I hope the coaches doesnt rely on Kim Yong Sik's positioning too much. Because sooner or later, the opponents will catch up and cut off any balls sent to him. \n\nOther than Kim Yong Sik, we also discovered Lim Nam Kyu, Ryu Eun Gyu, and Heo Min Ho strongest point. \n\nLim Nam Kyu- A good left winger(I thought he was a right winger before?), good pressing, his speed improves quite a bit although inconsistent, actives  in defence and building the attack, a great Captain\ud83d\ude0a(He's my bias so give me a break ok?)\n\nRyu Eun Kyu- Speed\u2714\ufe0f Skills\u2714\ufe0f I bet he will be the second assists star after Heo Min Ho.\n\nHeo Min Ho- What can I say? The man got pushed around  a lot, but he always showed his best. Got under appreciated a lot. His cross is a chef's kiss and his assist is a God-level.\n\n\nIf we look at the match in Ep90 and Ep91. These three always have some connection with each other. Some kind of telepathy? Lee Jun Yi's cross to Lee Dae Hoon was beautiful, too.\n\nIts good that our attacking side is improving, but it will be much better if our defence is improving too.\n\nMy opinion is based on YT's vids only. Therefore, I can't elaborate more on the players' performance. If any of you reading this have some soccer experience, please do share your takes on their latest development. \n\n(P.S. Please add something regarding other players, too. My view can be a bit biased as I usually focus on Lim Nam Kyu).",

Draws the attention of the defense because of his presence and allows this other attacker players to create dangerous situations",

It's like AJH kinda gave up on him. But I did see a bit of improvement during Entry System matches. It's just a bit inconsistent, and that's all. If we compare the before and after the 3rd audition, he looks less panicky when he gets the ball. \n\nI think you mean Park Jun Yong? The high-pitched balded guy? AJH picked him because he was most likely to win the ball in the midfield and good at tussling. The guy is good at call play but thats all I can remember abt him. I only watched YouTube highlights too.",

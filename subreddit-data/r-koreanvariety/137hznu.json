    "postText": "On one 'Boring Day,' I started watching Lets Play Soccer Season 2 on Netflix while trying to get out from 'binge-watching slump.' The show called The Gentlemen's League to be exact. I didn't know the show is still ongoing at that time and now I'm more than hooked to it, I AM OBSESSED. The show was of course had ups and downs and still is but it is more than enough to pull me into the soccer world. I started watching soccer contents and re-imagine how my bias would do it. I know it sounds crazy but it is the truth. What's even more crazy is, I started watching unsub version of it. (Years of watching K-Dramas doesn't betray me).\n\nOK Fine! I'll cut to the chase! I'm just curious how different is Season 1 compare to season 2? I heard Season 1 is not even subbed but if we do have people that watched it, YOU ARE THE OG Fan of Lets Play Soccer. Please do tell me how it was like back then. Tae-Tae Line vs Kyu-Gyu Line? Original member with low performance in season 2? How was the show's atmosphere? Entertaining? Dull? Do we had a Title Match Tour? Players Entry System or Extra Pay System? How did the show ended? \n\n(P.S. Dont forget to watch Lets Play Soccer every Sunday, 7:50pm KST on JTBC Entertainment Youtube Channel. Tips:- Wait around 1hour and half after the actual airing time. The playlist will ends with next episode trailer and 20mins something of soccer match. JTBC Voyage YT Channel will upload the soccer match with add-ons bits from the episode between Tuesday or Wednesday. Don't come after me if they don't, JTBC Voyage can be inconsistent sometimes).\n\nEojjeoda Avengers Fighting!!!!!",

            "comment": "I can't remember everything off the top of my head because I watched season 1 a while ago... but one of the main differences between season 1 and 2 was that season 1's concept was bringing in Korea's legendary (retired) athletes and creating a football club. There was Heo Jae, Lee Manki, Jin Jongoh, Lee Bongju, Yeo Hongchul, Yang Joonhyuk, and more... Athletes that are well-known in Korea because they excelled in their sports long time ago. So season 1's average age was a lot higher and the skill level much lower. They didn't know a lot of the rules either. In their first game, one of the players passed the ball back to Heo Jae, who was the goalkeeper, and he grabbed it with his hands lol. \n\nAnother thing was they played in a much smaller field and only played 8:8. In season 1, it was Tae-Tae Line because they were younger than the rest of the team and they were actually pretty okay back then. Lee Hyungtaek was considered good in season 1 too and that's probably why they brought him back for season 2, but with all the better, younger players, he's too slow. Lee Daehoon joined much later in the show and became the youngest of the team, but he quickly became the ace. \n\nThere was no Title Match Tour in season 1. It was more about them growing and improving as a team (and it was more variety than sport). When Ahn Junghwan wanted more players, they had the player come and play a match with them and if he liked them, they joined. If I remember correctly, he also made them pay if they were late because some players were notoriously late lol. In the last few episodes (which I didn't watch very carefully), they participated in a tournament and made it to the final, but lost. \n\nAs for the show, it was definitely entertaining, at least for me. I mean, these were retired, middle-aged men trying to play soccer. You could tell they had the athleticism and competitiveness, but their ages were holding them back. Season 1 started out from an idea that Ahn Junghwan, Kim Sungjoo, Kim Yongman, and Jung Hyeongdon talked about on another show they were on together, so I don't think Ahn Junghwan took season 1 as seriously as season 2. \n\nI don't know if I'm forgetting anything else, but this is what I can remember. I got into soccer because of season 1, but now that I'm a fan of the sport itself, I find season 2 a lot more fun. But season 1 still has a special place in my heart.",

They \"bagged\" on these newbie players, but I can't help but be amaze at how each of them committed to the sports and grow to be a decent players. I played futsal/footbal but even I am touched by the commitment that these celebrities took to be better. Watch it from beginning with lots of funny moment, and now seeing their growth is just inspirational.",

Ahn Jung Hwan, who is a former pro soccer player, created an amateur soccer team through audition, and currently, they are touring Korea to dominate the amateur soccer scene. \n\nYou should try to watch it, tho. The subbed version is on Netflix and is 5-7 episodes behind. They do have it on OnDemandKorea but for North/South America only. Not sure if it's subbed or not.",

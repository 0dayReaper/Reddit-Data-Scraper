I'd be more understanding of stuff getting removed that was over five years old, but just one year...?\n\nEdit: Looking at the responses on Viki's community forum, it seems these older episodes won't be coming back. Won't be renewing my subscription again after this year.",

Sometimes they pick it back up though.\n\n**Check here for where to watch other dating shows (and East Asian variety shows, Kdramas/Jdoramas/Cdramas/et cetera) with VPN/et cetera, you'll need it for VIU, Disney+, and so on**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zobw4m/where_can_i_watch_variety_shows_here_in_spain/j0m09qv/\n\nFor easy accessibility there's **ArmsAsuncion's website for redditors, it has East Asian variety shows, Kdramas/Jdoramas/Cdramas/et cetera.**\n\nThat website has **access to Viki, VIU, OnDemandKorea (this usually has no English subs though), iQIYI, and now WeTV/Tencent Video content**. So **no Netflix or Disney+ or not really the newer Korean OTT services/platforms** (as they don't usually have English subs) like wavve, Coupang Play, etc.",

    "postText": "The host is a young Korean lady (looks under 25) who is really straigtforward in a funny way and the show invites celebrities as guests. I watched 1 episode of it on YouTube I think the guest was Lee Dong-wook? And the young lady cooked for him and chatted with him and she was saying Lee Dong-wook is so handsome iirc. Sorry I'm not sure if it's a variety show because I only watched one episode of it but thank you in advance \ud83d\ude4f",

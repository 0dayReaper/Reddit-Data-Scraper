IRL, she seems like a wonderful friend to have, but in a RD like SI, not so much, where as content machine jia is great for a reality show like this.",

They don\u2019t follow each other on IG, but jia doesn\u2019t seem to be following anyone from SI on ig\u2026.?\n\nDid anyone get the feeling that sihun was never interested in sumin? The way he kept saying \u201csumin-ah sumin-ah\u201d on their trip to paradise was in such an ajuhssi tone, if that makes sense? I thought it was weird that he kept repeating her name like that as if she\u2019s a child lol. There was barely any aired footage of their date night so that probably means it was really boring.",

She liked Sehoon, but not enough for her to really chase him like Minji did. To be honest Sumin felt more mature because she didn't chase after a guy who is already interested in another girl and has another girl chasing him. Plus she came too late in the show. There really wasn't any other guys left aside from Sihun, so I don't think she was as hurt as Minji from the results.",

The hosts on the other dating shows are kind of annoying to listen to (mainly Love Catcher), whereas Heart Signal seems to have too many hosts.. too much commentary to listen to, too much going on which detracts from the viewing experience. I think with Inferno the transitions to commentary, the amount and length of commentary shown is just so well done. I hope they make a season 2 for this show.",

I like that they talked about how uncomfortable the situation was for Jiyeon and wish them the best. Deep down, I'm still not a fan of the persistent courting style but really hope everything works out for them!\n\nI also appreciate that Sehoon didn't lead Minji on but I felt so bad for her :( I don't think any of the guys would've been a good match for her anyway (except for Sehoon)\n\nSoyeon and Jintaek were the best couple with amazing communication, so much spontaneity and chemistry. I loved their lost it when Soyeon couldn't find his beard!! \n\nReally disappointed in Sihun's choice but he stayed true to himself I guess...(I feel so bad for Sumin but high key she deserved better).\n\nI'm not surprised that Jia chose Hyeonjoon because I wasn't feeling her chemistry with Hyunseung at ALL. I don't think they'll be together long though.\n\nYEAWON DESERVED BETTER. She was an emotional rock for all the women, constantly hugging them and encouraging them. Junsik was there, I guess.",

That courage can translate well into other ventures. Bad for him that he absolutely had no chance against the two other dudes.\n\n- Hyeonjoong won by becoming one with the mattress and waiting for Jia all week. That was hilarious.\n\n- Sehoon actually coming together with Jiyeon was a surprise given the rocky start. I think we aren't being fair towards him since the show didn't really point out the times he gave her space and from what we have heard there was plenty of time where they didn't even remotely interact. And no wonder he was so keen on locking one girl down, he has no free time as a restaurant owner LOL.\n\n- Honorable mention to Jintaek for being an absolute bro with Sehoon. Dude dropped all the intel for him lol.\n\n- Massive competitive disadvantage for the people that came late to the island. It certainly added some spice to the Jia storyline but besides that, there was too little time.\n\n- Jintaek and Soyeon are such a great fit if we go by optics. They look good together.\n\n- Yeawon and Junsik seem more like a friend thing. They seem to like similar activities but I didn't sense much electricity between them.\n\n- Yeawon's relationship with all the other girls was worth an own show. Could easily see her as a protagonist in some kind of observational show\n\n- I thought it was brutal the way they made the paths towards each girl at the final decision but it certainly added to the entertainment value\n\n- Overall I really liked the show. Pleasant change of pace.",

I also wasn\u2019t impressed by him last week BUT\n\nhe literally started off the date by telling Jiyeon that he is doing it for himself and that she should not feel any pressure. she smiled so much throughout the entirety of the date, she seemed at ease for - literally - the first time in nine days. he was considerate, explained his feelings really well, gave her space and didn\u2019t demand anything. the fact that she cried in front of him shows that Jiyeon must\u2019ve been comfortable enough to finally let her pent up feelings out. \n\nJiyeon\u2019s expressions are super easy to read. you could tell every single time when she wasn\u2019t ok w something during the show. in those two episodes there was 0 of that, she was giggling and seemed genuinely content with the final choice. y\u2019all are reaching a bit now\u2026",

Don't understand the hate for him and people even questioning the hosts' commentary on that segment. There's clearly a cultural difference in terms of how persistence is seen. Sure, his persistence did seem a bit much initially but I think he really redeemed himself in the last two episodes and did a better job with how he went about his persistence IMO. Glad it worked out for the both of them in the end.",

He never crossed the line and all he did was try to have a couple of conversations with her on the island, which were awkward. One of them he was forced to pick 2 girls to join him, where he picked Jia because he thought her and Jiyeon were close, so she would feel more comfortable. I feel like people don't understand how hard it is to have meaningful conversations, when the show doesn't allow them to reveal personal information about themselves. Essentially the show was promoting people choosing their partner based on looks only, since they are not allowed to talk about who they are as a person in the real world. Furthermore as Jiyeon mentioned she felt pressured by others to give him a chance, which made her more uncomfortable and if anything that made her distance herself even more from Sehoon. Looking back Sehoon was always very considerate and even tried to get to know more things about what she likes and dislikes through the guys who went on a date with her, since he didn't want to approach Jiyeon again and make her feel more uncomfortable. All he wanted was a chance for closure and to get to know her better, which once he got that, Jiyeon even picked him the next day. You can choose to treat him like a creep, but at the end of the day half of you in here are single because you give up when things get a little bit tough.",

I mean, I get they needed Jia to pull in attention since it's a new show but it almost feels like all the boys gravitated towards her by default (not blaming her at all, she's gorgeous and great) but it kinda put some of the other girls on the back burner (Yeawon for one, still sad she didn't get a chance with Hyunseung). \n\nSehoon honestly was one of my fave characters on the show but tbh I think it was mostly due to the editing, making him the underdog who works hard and succeeds kind of thing. Was all for him and Soyeon at the beginning but am really glad how things worked out and they got to be with the people they wanted.\n\nThere were a lot of cute moments in the show which I really appreciated after watching quite a few of the western dating shows in the past year or so. Seems like a hit with quite a few people too so can we safely expect season 2?",

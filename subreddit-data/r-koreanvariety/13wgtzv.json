The first 5 episodes are great so far and we were curious to know more about the contestants so we compiled all of them in one place.\n\nWe'll continuously update the website with more photos and information while the show airs. Don't worry, it's spoiler-free. Hope you guys like it!",

Either way, having a social media presence would be beneficial for her especially seeing how the show portrayed her to be more favorable than the soldiers' leader hehe",

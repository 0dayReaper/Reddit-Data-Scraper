Kakao region locked the show for whatever reason. Does anyone have a way to bypass this?. And if anyone knows does it have Eng subs out somewhere?",

I don't understand chinese but  watched the chinese sub to find out the ending. If I don't get it wrong (Spoiler result) &gt;! The male team won because they made efforts to save their friends while the female team just idling laughing and abandon their female friend who is in jail. After the tagger captured one of the girls, the game practically over. Pretty boring series because the girls were too passive and so did not generate a competitive situation.\n !&lt;",

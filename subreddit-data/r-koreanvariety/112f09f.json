    "postText": "I didn't watch rm for a few weeks and now randomly catching up with episodes. It's not that i was losing interest just fell out of things. I tried watching this week's episode and stumbled on to this comment somewhere which was interesting. I can't post links so just copied it all. so what do you think? I think she's been here for a few months now.\n\n&gt;**fruitpunch123** **a day ago**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To each their own, **but I find recent episodes by this Hyung In PD have been rather boring and stagnant. I think there have been already 2 episodes of same cooking concept at different locations that reminded me of Family Outing** (looks like next episode is possibly involve cooking again). **This, plus those long random sit-conversation shoots (should just be a talk show then), lack of innovative games (indoors and outdoors), missing comedy antics of Gwangsoo (which SeChan fails to step up), the recent feeling of heavy dependence on Jaesuk and Sukjin combi to carry the show**; it doesnt scream Running Man vibes anymore, **I thought its just another typical variety TV show programme (you can paste another title on it). Neither funny (maybe a couple of chuckles) nor exciting. I would be distracted on other things from watching the full episode. Even the previous PDs are more creative than the current.** Fanboys and fangirls can rage all they want, but I have been watching RM from the very beginning. **It has been a humble but steady declin**e. Though I hope this PD to improve and do well with the given new timeslot.\n\na reply:\n\n&gt;**yjs** **fruitpunch12316 hours ago** **edited**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;jihyo's participation in the second half heavily relied on haha and sechan trying to steal her card in the room and the freeze game, without them initiating the drama jihyo would not have been that active except for her young comment. sechan is one of the few cast members who can get jihyo to participate and loosen up, that's miracle worker level. kwangsoo in his last year was not as fun as he was before, at some point he was burnt out, he was not as crazy as he used to be, he calmed down a lot. **i do agree this pd is relying too much on the cast chemistry, the games are not are fun or entertaining as before, the talk segments can get redundant, but also there's cast injuries they can't play physical games that were exciting 10 years ago.**\n\nand another:\n\n&gt;**fruitpunch123** **yjs14 hours ago**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I agree with your constructive comments except the Sechan part, rather than some delusionals accusing I expected RM to do running or crazy physical activities. About JiHyo: She has been getting more passive and 'hidden' ever since Gwangsoo has left the team. GS has the ability to pull others out of their shell esp Jihyo with GS taking the limelight as the 'villain' or 'idiot one'. It wasnt that bad after GS left, she had banters with Jae Suk, SukJin and KJK. But I think somehow their love-line was banned/'cancelled' and now reverted back to her new low (since there are no other lines involving her). Currently the same, recurring attempts are SeChan, Haha, Jaesuk will try to get her participate by complimenting her fashion, looks or whatever one or two words she spoke out. **Sechan is a comedian, so I would expect him to do more after GS left, more than just getting Jihyo to participate. I**n fact I see Jaesuk is the main guy who repeatedly attempting to tease or be the fuse to trigger banters between her and KJK. **SC chemistry with Somin also kind of like fizzled out, IMO. I am not sure what is SC role in the show now.** He was doing great with GS before that. **And yes this PD rely too much on talk or \"chill\" segments which gotten redundant...** what I implying is there are many previously non-physical games that she can get inspired from. My easy examples are the indoors stock market game, or the gambling poker games. Those are innovative and entertaining, not even 10 years ago.\n\nim copy and pasting all the comments, but highlighting the interesting parts that I kind of agree with or think they make sense. im adding my thoughts in the comments.",

They played two games that day and one was completely edited out. The other was \\~7m of tag lmao. It's ironic, but the staff simply cater to what the majority of Running Man viewers enjoy. It's up to you whether you enjoy that or not. To me, it still feels like Running Man. If anything is missing from the so-called \"Running Man vibes\" I think its the guests. Signs of a changing industry, but I really miss the random gem guests, usually actors, like Ryu Seungsoo, Park Boyoung, Choi Minsoo, Go Ara. Some of the recent actresses have been in that vein.",

It's insane that their guests can actually be their children, and that their guests watched Running Man growing up.\n\nAnd because they're so old, they're bad at games now. Old Running Man would do games, pull of crazy challenges, and be quick-witted. And they could do it because the cast was in their 20s to 30s - Kwang soo was 24 when the show started and YJS was 37.\n\nNow you watch them struggle to understand the basic principle of even splitting up in freeze tag. You watch them struggle to think on their feet for verbal games like the car \"Strawberry\" type games. All the young guests and Sechan + Somin do well in these verbal games, but the older members just can't think as fast as they used to so they're almost always the ones making mistakes.",

I think it's fair to judge now. \ud83d\ude01\n\n- I think she's doing just fine. \n\nI agree with the person that said RM isn't looking to attract new viewers. I myself don't watch the show for games. Much in the same way as you mentioned in a comment, I am not a fan of the nametag ripping segments. Not because I find them uninteresting, but because I think they are seriously unfair and offer nothing exciting. I pretty much know what is going to happen: KJK will overpower everyone, JSJ and JSM will get eliminated immediately. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But I do miss the themed episodes where it would eventually end in a building with them looking for hints and solving for mysteries. Not necessarily a spy mission, because I think the cast finds it too burdensome. \n\n- Episodes are forgettable, as in: nothing stands out. \n\nThese past few episodes with HyungIn have one thing in common: they're forgettable. Usually, I can quickly remember why episode followed another and what the theme was and at least one major thing from the episode. I can't really say the same about HyungIn episodes. They sort of blend into eachother and it's hard to remember which followed which. They're very forgettable too. \n\n- Backlash for 628 that messed up their plans \n\nI think the backlash for episode 628 hit them hard. I believe they filmed another episode that must have been very similar to 628, and after 628 was aired and the backlash - they had to scrape that entire episode they shot. We never saw it. This meant they had to somehow come up with a new episode very soon! I think this threw them off course a little, which is why I think some episodes feel rushed and messy. \n\n\nI must say, I do think she is capable and doing a good enough job and has a great cast to rely on. I also really liked how she used a sweet concerned tone with JSM in the last episode after their talk. It was so heartwarming. So, I do like that she's the PD. She's also funny, which is a plus. \ud83d\ude01",

The most obvious one was when they need to travel to a location without gps(forgot which episode). People were mad at Jaesuk for not listening to other members but i think he was just trying to drag the \"conversation scene\" while reaching to the destination. It was obvious the member conversation is the main focus on the episode because the games was simple and other scenes was short.",

            "comment": "i don' think it's the pd, but because the members' are now losing creativity on this show. And I don't mean this in a bad way, but rather, I understand it. \n\nI don't know how to say it, but you can see that the members are losing the sparks to run the show. And I think it's because now they got too adapted to the show. Having a spy used to get them on their feet, but now, they don't even get excited over the spy because they've known each other for way too long, so they found the spy in an instant. It used to be confusing, nerve-wrecking and get the audience intrigued to find out who's the spy, but these days, you can see that they just act like they don't know who the spy is to carry on with the show. \n\nThey used to get excited over guests especially actress/idols that is not close with them, but as they have been running in the industry for years, now all the guests are like friends coming over and they don't get excited or give big reactions anymore. Most of the members are now married/have a partner, so they can't use the loveline tactics with the guest. Even for the single members like KJK, YSC, and SJH, they don't like playing the 'love maniac' role like Kwangsoo, Gary and Haha used to play. Now we only have JSM to play that role. \n\nSo I feel like at one point, it's not that they don't want to do things like old days, but it's just that it won't feel the same anymore and they have no choice but to depend on their talks and chemistry. If they play spy, the members are too good, it won't be funny or natural. If they play name tags among members, KJK will dominate 90% of the time. If they play tag among guests, 95% possibility is RM members winning. Everything was expected and have no surprise.\n\nSo they have to depend on small but funny games like debate (that highlights their funny banter), quizzes (highlighting dumb characters), word game (highlight members with bad wits) because those created the funny scenes. \n\nI personally believe that what makes a funny reality show is when the members are left flustered and their reactions are what making it funny. I mean, just look at HDYP/HWY, they climbed in ratings when Kim Tae Ho PD did projects that left YJS flustered. All the activities was random, and YJS's reaction was what making it funny. Now that HYDP are turning into similar game show, the ratings are declining.\n\nSimilarly, RM Chul Min's PD second era was one of the best because his punishments are brutal and left members speechless. Crocodiles, some crazy rides, flying on air. The members gave an honest flustered reaction and that's what making it fun. Now, they don't even get scared of penalties because they are very used to it.\n\nI would say one of the best ep is the one with IVE recently. I'm not even their fan, but you can see the members are genuinely being excited to meet these girls. They were all paying attention, and have full interest on what is going on. All of them play an active role, and their reactions are genuine. \n\nSimply said, the members no longer get excited because everything is now no longer felt new. So they definitely need some fresh ideas, but that's the problem. After 12 years, what fresh ideas can you have? The only thing I can think of rn is probably having New Jeans over, because they have been mentioning NJ, and Ik the members will be very excited and active on that episode. \n\nSo I definitely do not blame the members because they have been running hard for 12 years.",

            "comment": "Assuming people here are able to talk candidly about the subject: My super TLDR on Hyung In's era is that she is extremely reliant on the cast being self-sufficient in producing content rather than creating situations that make it easier on them. \n\nPeople have been crediting her for things that are entirely out of her control. If you separate the Running Man cast from the content, then the content would be lackluster. She has done an ok job working with the cast thus far, but so far she has no unique flair of her own. Most of her 'good' episodes are because she lets the cast roam freely and do all the work (IMO obviously). Based on Pinggyego, the RM cast can easily talk for hours and still be entertaining, but is that 'Running Man.'\n\nSome things that can be attributed to her:\n\n* Reusing the multi-week sticker board (618 - 622) that happened multiple times in Cheol Min's era.\n\nBetween just having random amounts of stickers being handed out each episode and leading to a situation where Jae Seok actually had a 0% chance of getting the punishment, it was just poorly executed. Compare this to episode 351 where So Min and Jae Seok went all out and were able to give people the punishment even though some had 0 stickers at the start. \n\n* Being strict when it's unnecessary and not having enough control when she should. \n\nIn the Jae Seok sleigh Christmas episode, she was unnecessarily strict to one of the citizens when he gave an answer to the quiz. The entire point of the episode was to ***give gifts*** out to ***random citizens*** and she wouldn't let his answer slide. In another episode (Too lazy to look up the exact number): Haha was able to give out 2 completely different answers to a quiz because she wasn't able to stop his turn after giving out 1. This resulted in many members of the cast being frustrated with her. \n\n* Thoughts on Jihyo\n\nEpisode 641: The way she talks is very much a conversation stopper. Many members rarely bounce / riff off of whatever she is saying. When they were doing the Senior / Junior talk, she seemed genuinely angry with Se Chan for saying \"Ya\" even though that was the entire point of the segment. If Jae Seok and Jong Kook didn't reroute the conversation, then it would have stayed uncomfortable. (I'm also pretty sure she didn't take part in conversation after this part. She didn't take part when So Min was talking about her problems or Jong Kook doing everything alone). I also saw a good amount of hate from Jihyo stans towards Se Chan for taking her card. I feel bad for the members for having to walk on eggshells around a member of a ***variety show.*** She does not even receive 1/10th of the 'abuse' that Seok Jin and So Min get from the other members, but she gets overly emotional. (She was even angry during the dog debate in the IVE episode). \n\nJihyo is a ***12 year veteran*** of a variety show, but her stans protect her more than most idols. After Jae Seok stopped pushing the SpartAce ship, she lost most of her character because she does not take any initiative on her own. She still gets paid thousands of dollars per episode to work with 6 talented people who make her job easy because under normal circumstances, they can make entertainment out of nothing.",

I know she's quiet, her initial character was literally the \"quiet genius\" type, but she hasn't been able to express that lately. \n\nWhich gets me to my second point: we need more complex games/games in general. I'm not saying to do crazy stuff like the name tag games (the cast is already old and injured anyways) but even smaller stuff like figuring out riddles, playing a guessing game with citizens, or playing a life sized board game would be more engaging than just 90 min of talking.",

When people say that \"Oh RM has had a lot of episodes, it's fine if they just talk now\", that just sounds like an weak excuse to me. Sure IC fell off towards the end too, but just look at how much Taeho PD did, even until the end. The RM PDs are just too comfortable (or maybe just forced by the execs, since RM brings in a *lot* of money) to change things around, and I doubt adding a new person will change that. \n\nI haven't watched RM since the Global Random Tour because the quality has just decreased. Each episode has an hour plus of just *talking*, like isn't this supposed to be \"Running\" Man? And sure, you can say the cast is older, etc, etc, but (for me, at least) it's been like 4 years of lower quality episodes. Sure, they don't have to run around, but is it *so* hard to create games where they can sit, like puzzles, or do things that don't involve a lot of physical activity, like talking to citizens? Even people who *didn't* like the current PD enjoyed the gambling game so they clearly have something going there, but they just aren't embracing it. \n\nI don't think RM will end anytime soon (maybe in the next 3-4 years though) but it's purely because of the dedicated fanbase. The PDs aren't putting in quality ideas and the cast is comfortable when they're at. I doubt things will change anytime soon.",

He should stop caring about losing. sometimes when the guest try giving him the penalty he starts acting like a kid throwing tantrums like \"you don't even know me!!!!!\" I dislike that a lot. he just takes the winning/losing too seriously, so if he betrays it's only to win.

That first family outing style episode was the first RM episode after they changed their broadcast time and they did better than expected in the ratings. So the PD repeated the concept to try and get that rating boost / positive response again.\n\nAs for the point of being reliant on the members. I thought it was worse during Bopil PD's time lol. Near the end of Bopil's tenure as main PD, he had whole segments where the members had to come up with their own games with no direction from the PDs. MC Jaesuk in the sauna for example. Or that MT episode where YJS was so restless after lunchtime because he had to make enough content out of nothing. I honestly don't mind having episodes being mainly driven by the members' conversations, but they do better when given direction or a topic. One good example that I liked is the episode where the members had to come up with pickup lines or kkondae lines and be voted on by the public. \n\nAs for SJH lol. I feel a lot has already been said. But in the latest episode, I thought it was funny that she suddenly declared herself leader of the maknaes and that her fans are happy to group her with members they themselves hated from the beginning just because it might give SJH a new character.",

You're absolutely right here. I just thought they were trying so hard to shove her into this line in order to make her sound/look/feel younger? Because I think it's weird how they treat her. Her fans are actually like idol fans, babying their favorites. It's odd to see it happening with a middle aged person as I've never really ever seen it. \n\nBack to the point: Even KwangSoo wasn't a maknae member. Like I said in another comment, that word means youngest not younger. The only reason there is a line is because the youngest just happen to be two people born in the same year. They can even make a distinction and say YSC is the only Maknae. They don't because Koreans (and most people really) consider people born in the same year as same age. \n\nA person only belongs to the maknae line if they are actually a maknae, individually. The unofficial title of the leader went to KwangSoo because of episode 441, which is the honeybee episode. SeChan and SoMin were relatively new still (only one year on the show), and were the spies. It was the maknae line against their seniors. However, it wouldn't be a fair fight, would it? \n\nNot only are the two of them the youngest, they're also the newest members and lack significant experience. So to help them out - the former maknae memebr was called in. KwangSoo actually protested saying he wasn't a maknae anymore, so he wasn't part of the maknae line and that he was\nconfused as to why he was there. He actually didn't want to be there. \n\nWhen Haha found the hint, they were confused about KwangSoo too until someone said \"he was the maknae before SeChan and SoMin\". \n\nSeChan and SoMin asked him to help them in exchange for being their leader. Which he accepted. That's how the title came about. It isn't\nactually a thing. They were bribing KwangSoo to get him to help. \ud83d\ude02",

This made Kwangsoo the perfect leader. The only other member left who fits that description now is HaHa. Recently the maknaes collaborated with HaHa on his Twitch. It showcased how perfect he is as their leader. They all carry a natural youthful energy, are great at dancing, keep up with the trends and are thick skinned enough to take a savage roasting from members and sometimes guests also. \nFor all of the above reasons I consider HaHa as the leader of the Maknaes.\n\nEdit:\nI have no major issues or complaints about the pd or Sechan. I think people are being unfairly harsh.",

Isn't the \"talking time\" first getting attention in Bopil era and still getting a good response in Hyung In era? The fact that Korean GP which is their primary target like it means things work and personally there's nothing wrong with that. \n\nAlso I do like \"talking time\" segment because it's fun to see they talking about anything and they have the ability to make it fun too. Playing big game (ripping name tag &amp; spy game) is fun too but how member act is like having a pattern and it's kinda repetitive for me. \n\nDoing work for a show that's been running for more than decade that having no constant concept for every week sure it's hard (look at IC, although RM not in extreme side like IC). You gonna stumble into idea block or used idea.\n\nI do hope RM with Hyung In and her vision can go into higher state and make it big. Also hope RM can get a stable rating since it's bouncing on 4% and 5% and can broke through stable 6% and broke their last year record which is 7.2%.",

            "comment": "BoPil PD also had one episode where all the cast did was just sit and talk. \n\nI think Hyung In PD is doing fine. She's trying very hard, and bringing in lots of big name guests the past few weeks. I personally do not like big name guests bcos I feel like the cast restrain themselves in those episodes and don't go all out but if it helps with the numbers then it should be a good thing? \n\nI personally find Se Chan extremely annoying. He's on par with Jo Se Ho for me, where they're both comedians who are grating, but are well taken care of by YJS. So Min isn't a comedienne but I feel she creates more organic and funnier moments in RM and Sixth Sense that are memorable. The show feels lacking without her. \n\nOfc this is just my opinion. Se Chan is well loved by the RM cast and they spoke constantly about him when he was down with covid. But he constantly does irritating things that doesn't make the show any more humorous. Like stealing JiHyo's card and then getting one extra through the lucky draw. Like, dude, just give the original one back to her. But, in line with Se Chan's type of comedy, he wouldn't. \n\nI do think that the show could do with some fresh or younger blood, to replace Kwang Soo. Having YSC (despite my dislike for him) and So Min, somewhat revived RM. Look at 1N2D after Seon Ho joined, it became better too. But it won't be easy to find someone who can fit into the RM cast dynamic - unless Kim YeonKoung decides to join them hahhahaa",

I think Hyung In is doing a great job. The cast chemistry has been great and I love the new dynamics that they've been trying (ex. Somin and HaHa). I personally like the 'boring and stagnant' aspects of the show sometimes and the 'family outing -esque feel, feels nostalgic. \n\nWe as audience members need to let Kwang So go. Please! He was great and I loved him but he's gone and doing others shows. Se Chan was never brought onto the show to be similar to Kwang So (though I will admit I did not like him in the beginning but he's grown on me). Also, it's not Se Chans duty to get Ji Hyo to participate, she's been doing great on her own! I love her one-liners, how lucky and sometimes unlucky she is, also her hairstyles and fashion choices have been amazing! But tbh Ji Hyo being quiet isn't something new...\n\nAnyway, I will continue to support running man until the very end!",

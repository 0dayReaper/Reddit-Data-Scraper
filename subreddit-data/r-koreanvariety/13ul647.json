    "postText": "[allkpop link](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2023/05/only-mukbangs-traveling-and-showing-off-celebrity-homes-netizens-talk-about-the-decline-of-variety-shows-compared-to-the-earlier-days)\n\nNetizens talked about the decline of variety shows compared to the earlier days.\n\nOn May 28, one netizen took to a popular online community forum and wrote, \"I'm not from that era, but from what I hear from my sister, the variety shows from long time ago were apparently super entertaining. When I look up variety shows from the past, there are so many fun episodes so I just watch them all on YouTube.\"\n\n\n\nThe netizen then critized the variety shows from the recent days, writing, \"Nowadays, they're all mukbangs, about traveling, or installing cameras in celebrities' homes so that they can show off just how fancy their lives are, how happy their lives are, how kind they are to their families, or how happily they take care of their children...They only do reactions whereas long time ago, they used to throw their bodies around and become the center of the joke, so viewers would connect with them really well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetizens commented:\n\n\"I hate 'I Live Alone' and 'Omniscient Point of Interference' the most. I came to the realization that I have no idea why I'm sitting there watching these things, so I stopped watching them.\"\n\n\"Only the panel members are switched out, but if you just look at the VCR you can't even tell the difference between 'I Live Alone' and 'Omniscient Point of Interference'.\"\n\n\"Seriously, all they show nowadays are stuffing themselves with food and laughing amongst themselves.\"\n\n\"For real, they are not genuine at all. They just play, eat, and talk amongst themselves and have a ton of PPLs...so boring.\"\n\n\"Nowadays, I only see celebrities showing off their money. Loll.\"\n\n\" 'Hangout With Yoo' is the most severe. I recently watched if after a while and unknowingly blurted out, 'what the f*ck are they doing?' \"\n\n\"I stopped watching variety shows after 'Infinite Challenge' ended.\"\n\n---\nDo you guys agree with what the Korean netizens are saying? I kinda agree, I feel like I'm been losing interest in the recent episodes, and the new shows are mostly travel-oriented, with an all-male cast too.",

            "comment": "I think another problem with old school variety show disappearing nowadays is that it's just easier and less time consuming for stars compare to an observation show or a Youtube video. An old school variety show takes about 8-10 hours to film a 1 hour and more footage. A new style variety show takes about 2-3 hours for 2 episodes. A Youtube video (2 parts) about 40 mins could be film in 1 hour. It's easier for their schedule and could get more promotion to the main audience they want to target - the MZ. This is the reason in recent years why most of the big stars are more focused on Youtube videos/observation shows.",

He said it on the show he try his best so RM don't change too much and retain that classic variety show but ultimately rating is still very important for broadcaster that why a lot of show getting cancelled nowadays.\n\nI'm follow k-show since Infinity challenge. Back then it all about entertain viewer with laugh and that the main job of the cast or even the guest of the show. But today a lot of show is just talk show and celebrities life. One of the biggest grip for me in this current trend, we lost a lot of platform for finding hiding gem in entertainment show. Mijoo for example, after her appearance in RM, a lot of praise from netizen for her entertainment skilll even though she a idol. She end up become one of the cast on How do you play? and even winning award for it. Without show like this we might discover less and less hidden talent like her.",

IMO, actors travelling abroad all came from the Over Flowers concept that got Na PD daesang (alongside 3MAD). While the observations shows all came from Japan's variety shows, it really just exploded IMO when My Ugly Duckling exploded around 2016/2017 with Sangmin. There's also now alot of sports related shows because of Shooting Stars. There maybe is no proof but IMO HYEMILEECHAEPA and No Math was because of Earth Arcade. Same with Mr. Trot catapulting alot of trot-type shows.\n\nAlso, people forget that PDs get burnout. Kim Taeho seems to be happy now doing one-off shows with his new pet Hyori (lol joke). Iirc, the rumor (cant confirm) is Na PD left KBS also because of burn out and Human Condition was KBS last ditch effort to try to persuade him. RM was on its downward trend in 2015 and tried to do big changes with KHD before backtracking due to backlash.\n\nUltimately, its a matter of confidence between the PD and the broadcasting company. There were alot of new shows around 2015-2020 that arent exactly copycats. From KB, LEDT to Night Goblin, Player 7, Crime Scene, The Society, etc. The covid probably scared the broadcasting companies to do shows that arent profitable right now, hence the current landscape.",

My favourite show is probably Family Outing but mainly because the cast was amazing and relativly young back then. I'm not seeing though any new faces that would try to make similiar show nowdays and older stars are not going to invest their time in productions like this. Yoo Jae Suk talked few times how hard it is to produce and star in a outside variety like this. It's just too taxing for older folks.",

For instance, early 2010s RM always had members from different kpop groups participate and do outdoor missions. I think it's because the focus has now shifted to gaining international recognition, so appearing on many variety shows just isn't a top priority anymore, but take my opinion with a grain of salt because 1.) I'm not that exposed to popular variety shows nowadays so I might be wrong altogether, and 2.) I have a lot of nostalgia for the old shows and it may be clouding my judgment lol",

It is like so because an idol's contract with the agency is a 7 year contract.\n\nThe cutoff between generation is not very clear but typically it is demarcated by the debut of a hot new Boy Group / Girl Group by the big 3 agencies (SM, YG, JYP).\n\nThose that debut in the middle of a generation are also considered the 0.5 gen of their generation.\n\nHere are some examples.\n\nGen 1: FinKL, SES, HOT, Shinhwa, Sechs Kies\n\nGen 2: 2NE1, SNSD, Wonder Girls, Super Junior, Big Bang, 2PM, 2AM, Shinee\n\nGen 3: Black Pink, Red Velvet, Twice, Mamamoo, BTS, ~~Shinee~~\n\nGen 4: Aespa, ITZY, (G)IDLE, IVE, NewJeans\n\nThere are some other characteristics that define each generation as well. Like Gen 1 idols are the more nascent era of kpop where they draw a lot of inspiration in their concepts, styling and songs based on American and Japanese groups. Gen 2 is where the whole industry became more structured. Gen 3 is where they start go global with a lot more non-korean members. Gen 4 is where the focus is global audience and barrierless content like having different languages subtitles on their own youtube content is a given nowadays and being able to communicate in English is becoming a basic requirement.",

They are perpetually afraid of any risk so they just do what everyone else is doing which is incredibly stupid to do in a creative field. So the fans have learned that they can bully these companies into doing what they want because they are afraid of losing fans. \n\nLike its a really big deal that there is like one maybe two companies that refused to make comments about the dating lives of their idols. One would think that is the bare minimum of human decency. What people do in their private life is none of our business.\n\nAs a side note I always find it absolutely hilarious how many crew members they employ on k variety shows. You do not need 15camera operators and 6writers on set. \n\nMost of these shows are just shooting 4-6 people playing games in a room. All you need is like 3 camera operators. Each operator is in charge of 2 cameras a static tripod shot and a hand operated camera for closeups and moving shots.",

Back then there used to be Family Outing and Infinite Challenge that was genuinely the funniest variety show I've seen, I re-watched Family Outing three or four times now.\n\n I would like to say that it's mostly due to the casting directions these shows have chosen. Hangout with Yoo is a good example of this, they decided to add many members to the show for no reason because most of them have a sense of forced humor. It's also correct to only keep Jaesuk, Mijoo, and Haha moving onwards because they have a smart sense of humor. \n\nThere are other shows like I Live Alone which has gone downhill ever since the Hyunmoo and Hyejin breakup, I stopped watching after that because the chemistry between the hosts aren't there anymore. Nobody wants to see a typical lifestyle. \n\nHowever, there are shows like Adventure by Accident or Youn's Kitchen that is lots of fun but in a relaxing way. It's 100% based on casting of the show, if it has members that doesn't know how to lead or be entertaining the show won't do well.\n\nA good example is Europe Outside Your Tent: Spain Season 2. There were moments in which I find it cringe / hard to watch because of the member interactions. In addition, the cast are actors, not someone whos made for a variety show or someone who talked well.",

Bungee jumps, diving into the sea, sleeping outdoors, making money through local jobs, etc. If you watch something like The Human Condition season 1, these challenges are not replicated very often.",

They did do the episode for the fans meetup in Philippines recently and I thought it was a refresher from all the indoor games they've been playing. I also want to mention Earth Arcade games being repetitive and low quality in Season 2, I felt like they could have put more effort into designing the games. They do have great chemistry together though, with all the bantering!",

I feel like the forced humor made the main 3 worse than their normal level because its hard for them to bounce off eachother when they don\u2019t let it flow naturally. \n\nI also was forced to drop I live Alone when Hyejin broke up.

She was like the glue that held that show together. \n\nI think Earth Arcade is the perfect example of this. They have a comedian on the show but she is rarely funny. I actually enjoy her more for her ability to get music answers/dances right.\n\nThe other 3 girls that are idols are the ones that make the show funny.

I am not talking just extreme level like that, but just the overall safety rules. And to an extent that is good thing to prevent accidents in any workplace.\n\nHonestly speaking, the game I hate the most to watch in any shows is where they hit gourd or metal tray on their head. Seems so simple yet seems so dangerous.\n\nI'd be happy to just have simple shows that don't have to have lavish/complicated/extravagant setting or run around the city like the old RM, but simple, stimulating and interesting, like The Genius or Problematic Men (can it make a comeback?).",

            "comment": "I kinda get the points but imo more than current shows getting boring it's more that for some netizens after living life mostly sedentary &amp; staying mostly in one place due to covid19 the stimulation from current shows are no longer enough. during covid19 peeps are mostly forced to stay inside and had to be satisfied looking at celebs in variety shows doing mukbangs, travelling, showing their lifestyles, houses, or their home projects, or pursuing romance. it may be time for some of these netizens to start going outside more, finding hobbies, doing mukbangs, traveling themselves, connecting with other people and so on than stay at home watching other peeps doing stuff. \n\nIf I were shows producers in SK esp. ones that are working in stations with good funding, I will start pitching for special projects in current shows or for new variety shows that would involve large numbers of viewers to take part as well in the show. For example, 1n2d used to have a special episodes where they invited their viewers to take part in 1n2d trip. There were an age episode where they invited viewers from 10 yo to 90 yo if not wrong. There were also an episode where they invited foreign workers in SK. RM can also do a special where groups of invitees - can be idols, can be actors or actresses or other entertainers, can be non-celeb based on specific themes - participate in name-tag-ripping games with the members acting as captain for each team. \n\nObservant variety shows are still a case by case thing for me. I find ILA still interesting because some guests like the recent Kim Daeho announcer give some new inspiration in how to spend time when you are living alone. Omniscient one rly depends on the guests and their managers but i rly prefer times where I can at least got to know some new or unique managing tips whtr it's from the celebs or their managers: time, food, people, money management stuff. Traveling shows are only interesting if they are places that you can realistically go there sometimes preferably sooner but unlike celebs and variety staff which seem to have flexible schedule and bigger budget to go anywhere in the world nowadays, peeps like me have to think about getting work permissions and budgeting so I am hating and avoiding most of these travel shows nowadays lmao. X Man &amp; Love Letter imo can still be popularized and adapted to current days just emphasize more on the physical and linguistic games &amp; don't need to emphasize on romantic love lines btwn casts too much: there are friendship love, parental love, fans love, etc.. focusing on romantic love lines makes things weird btwn the casts &amp; encourage viewers to think that purely professional platonic relationships are impossible btwn celebs which eventually lead to their fans attacking each other or attaching the celebs to each other despite these celebs having no interactions at all outside the shows.",

Also, idol shows were sooo good, granted, I think now it's just that I'm not as interested in this gen's idols compared to 2nd gen or even 3rd gen, but they were always so funny and albeit, polished at times, I felt like I really got a real insight to some of the idols lives/personalities through them.  \nI haven't consistently watched any variety show since IC ended / since RM had that discourse abt kicking out Song Ji Hyo &amp; Kim Jong Kook. I just started The Manager and I really like it, but I think it's because I've never watched any of the shows that mirror it like I Live Alone. I watched ep 1-13 in full, and then I started skipping eps and just watching the parts I'm interested in though lately.",

The PDs like to work with same people, main  MCs tag their line every where\u2026this is leading to stagnation of variety shows. I saw many talents and after few months they are no where to be seen, which is unfortunate.",

            "comment": "Honestly I think it all comes back to the death of TV. It isn't just a variety issue, or a Korea issue, worldwide less and less people are tuning into TV shows. You can already see this trend in variety shows with people like Jang Syuk Kyu and Johnathan getting their start on YouTube and then moving to TV shows. \n\nBack in the day, 2D1N S1 had *huge* ratings, same for the early episodes of RM, but if people stop watching, naturally PDs have less money to splurge on fun stuff. Literally the only exception right now to this is JJY PD. \n\nGag comedy is also on the decline, with literally the *only* gag show out there being Comedy Big League. Seugeun also talked about how all the old comedy theatres he used to perform at closed down because less and less people came. So naturally, less people are gonna watch the \"throw your body\" humor that was so common in early 2D1N.\n\nOf course, we sometimes have exceptions that break the norm, Beat Coin is a good example of one of them, but these \"observation variety\" shows are just what's gonna be the norm now. And it's not too bad, honestly I do enjoy some of them like TROS or educational ones like the traffic accident one (forgot the name), but I do miss the crazy challenges and actions of old.",

I think they've done like 3 cooking episodes and 2 of them was like the same thing, starting fire, outdoors, etc. iirc. \n\nI do kinda get the sentiment though. I tried watching those shows in the mountains/camping because I like the visuals but 50% of the \"entertainment\" is from the person doing the subtitles. Star does mundane thing, production team spice it up with subtitles. Then like 1/3 of the time is just slowed zoomed in shots of washing vegetables, etc. like what?",

I mean, even if they are making up things especially for the member (panel(?)) as they need to make things entertaining as they are the one who keep appearing, it's still considered as following the concept, because, well, celebrity can pick up new hobby or do something new like other human being. Since the concept only showing you what kind of things your favorite celebrity that live alone.\n\nMy Ugly Duckling and OIV is kinda straying from their concept, especially My Ugly Duckling which I don't even know what they are doing anymore to keep doing unnatural gathering which ofcourse unnatural. I mean, are they even reality (observational?) show which showing many unnatural gathering that they do? Okay, gathering in somebody house can pass the vibe as reality show since, celebrity can play and gather together at somebody house. But, like gathering like MT at villa or resort or whatever it's with banner behind them? Like every month?\n\nGathering of member like ILA did is kind okay since they do it once in a while, kind of filler between episode before non member episode come. But MUD keep doing it in unnatural way which kind of weird. Can't comment on OIV since I don't really watch it nowadays but what I get from the last time I watch it is, well, straying off their own concept.\n\nTo be honest, with the concept of reality show, isn't it good that celebrity staying true while showing their house? I do feel envy and jealous because I also want great house like them, but so what? they earn it by himself, but people keep hate it because their insecurity, like? Come on dude. Tbh, not all of them that appear at ILA is successful enough to have a big ass house like Yoo Ah In have (I amazed on how big ass his house are that appear on the show). At least, they show kind of realistic potrait of rookie celebrity that just go their popularity, not really big celebrity that not really rise that much but still in the industry, medium sized wealth, or maybe just successful celebrity that don't bother to use their money to buy a big ass space that they don't want or need it.",

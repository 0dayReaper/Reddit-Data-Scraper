It felt like another healing type of episode and the cast has grown on me a lot. \n\nSince it's still the elephant in the room though, I've been thinking about HDYP and its problems, so this will be a long comment. It's obviously still YJS's show, which is fine but isn't great when the cast is split into groups and the team without him noticeably gets less screen time. Seven people is a lot of people for when the show still mostly revolves around just one person. You can see it this week and in next week's preview too where only 4 of them are with the guests. Also while ratings are bad (\\~4%) compared to HDYP before, it's actually similar to many other variety shows that are still considered successful. I actually think the major problem is the lack of topicality and relevance on OTT/streaming, like you can see on their YouTube channel, the views aren't great especially compared to HDYP before (even compared to the 5 member days), and on variety show rankings HDYP rarely makes an appearance. I think this is why even with these healing eps that are enjoyable to weekly viewers, it doesn't really help the overall situation of the show, and that if things were to carry on as is, it would just continue on a steady decline. A change in production team would have helped but HDYP is kind of a difficult show with how abstract it is, so a more drastic change is probably needed even though it'd be polarizing. I feel like what MBC will do with the cast isn't set in stone because they're still considering viewer reactions and maybe cast reactions, and I guess we won't find out for a few weeks. Still, in my opinion I think change is better than no change especially when HDYP's major strength was doing something different. I do hope they retain some people though like the article announced instead of wiping out everyone except YJS because I like them, but hope they don't replace and add more people to keep it flexible. I also think solo YJS is just not gonna happen anymore so no point in discussing. HDYP needs its own identity distinct from RM and hopefully it doesn't become a You Quiz copy too, but I get why they didn't just end the show because it's hard to create a popular show these days. \n\nTldr: Episodes like these are fun and healing but I think HDYP needs to change to regain its relevance",

                    "comment": "Agreed.\n\nThe difference between KTH and current PD is that KTH always goes for challenges. And with it variety things happened. Including these healing episodes. Special case do happened yes, just like the two only student in an island during Mudo. Its just there is no excitement on members face during filming. There is no challenging expectation for them when they started the morning and goes to filming.\n\nTake Mi Joo, her progress hasn't been that well if i'm honest. We still sees her like two years ago. A crazy and spontaneous but else is still lacking in term of entertainment. Not helping is that Jinjoo turn out has the same character with her. Weak in physical and lack in conversation.\n\nJJH is just shadow of his former self. He's playing it so safely, it get boring so fast. Mina is very good but she doesn't elevate the other girls that much as senior. Yi Kyung still looking for foothold, nothing big yet.\n\nYJS need to realize something too. Talk might be his choice of comedy these days, but he's already has two shows for it. I love YJS because his shows offers you different kind of \"variety\" of variety shows. But the theme is so similar that is all just ddeunddeun/yoo quiz with different persons and some activity in between.",

She isn\u2019t athletic so she can\u2019t fully participate in physical episodes. She\u2019s not as witty or funny as the other members. She\u2019s an idol but let\u2019s face it, the WSG wannabes and Jinjoo can sing circles around her. \n\nMina is a nice person but she didn\u2019t make any particular steps towards getting close to the girls despite being a senior. Maybe it\u2019s the age gap but she kept sticking to Haha and JJH instead.\n\nAgree about YJS as well. When they started interviewing citizens in this episode, it was just Yoo Quiz again. He refuses to go back to the old format because it was hard on him. Fine. But then he also ignored the viewers when they said they didn\u2019t want to see his friends as permanent members. \n\nIt could be that he took matters into his own hands because the new production team and PD were so incompetent. But I hope he\u2019s more flexible when the new production team enters the picture. Otherwise there\u2019s no salvaging this show.",

I'm reluctant to judge anyone's performance on the show because the concepts have been pretty bad and honestly no one's been outstandingly funny to me (even YJS) but to me it's easy why to see Mijoo made the cut. She's a young, promising face in variety that has a lot of potential, and she has great chemistry with Haha and YJS. The Instagram segment in the previous episode almost felt like a foreshadowing, since that was basically centered around YJS, Haha, and Mijoo",

You took the words right out of my mouth. \n\nIt's less so a cast issue and more so a concept issue. So much so that even the most veteran and popular members (Haha, Jaesuk) can't really save the show for me. \n\nEven members who have done comedy (Mina on Comedy Big League and Junha) struggle to come up with anything remotely funny. Sometimes it just seems like the mission takes away all the comedic aspects because it  doesn't create moments for (potential) humor. I guess the funniest thing these few episodes was the dressing up and role play of the bald eagles? It was funny to see Mina in character with her satoori. \n\nI wrote this in the post announcing their departure, but even Yikyung, whom I've watched Welcome to Waikiki and Lotto King, and is someone whom I've always found to be really funny without trying too hard, is surprisingly not funny here. The same for Mijoo who is consistently funny/\"crazy\" on Sixth Sense. It feels as if the PD extinguished their passion for being funny. \n\nI've yet to finish this week's episodes because 30 minutes in and the show seems like it's going nowhere. A rather boring concept again. It's nice to see all of them back together, though, calling Byungjae back was rather random.",

JSM and JSH were quick and funny and worked hard to contribute to the flow of conversation. Meanwhile, Mijoo sat quietly until she was specifically prompted.\n\nThe biggest factor in her favor is that she gets along with YJS, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be very useful when the show continues and they need a cast member who doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re going to pass out any second.

Or she\u2019ll come home and just collapse near the door because she\u2019s exhausted all the time now. So no, it\u2019s not a stretch to point it out.\n\nI\u2019m not pinning anything on her. If that\u2019s what you think I\u2019m doing, you\u2019ll have to go back and reread from my first reply. The point is that she was no better than any of the other members and it\u2019s strange that they decided to keep her but remove the rest.",

She actually used the word \"lie down\". \n\nBut with regards to your point, I don't think her lack of energy is part of the problem. She's funny on other shows, I've seen her potential. This show went downhill so much so that even putting the best or the most veteran cast can't salvage it. \n\nAlso, I'm not sure if it's a fair comparison since Deundeun is a chill talk show so I get why she wasn't as talkative. Even BTS Jimin didn't really talk in the first few minutes.",

He's a PD with a long and outstanding career, people like him don't take over other people's shows but instead start their own. Also I'm not sure of the logistics but I think PD's might sometimes be tied to the TV channel they're on. All of Na PD's shows are on TVN/ their OTT platform TVing, and has been this way for a long time, where as HDYP is on MBC. \n\nAnother factor is that one of the only other legendary PD's is the original PD for this show; Kim Taeho, it would be extra insulting to take over his show and I also think they're kind of thought of as rivals some of the time. \n\nIf you want to check out more Na PD show's are the currently airing Earth Arcade, Jinny's kitchen, New journey to the west and youth over flowers.",

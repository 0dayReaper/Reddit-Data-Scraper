    "postText": "From filming in Finland, back to South Korea, and now to Indonesia. Did Na PD eat the entire budget of the entertainment division of TVN for 2023? \n\nThis is really new, I've never heard of a show filming \"additional\" content especially for a seasonal show.\n\nWas the planned content not enough? \n\nWith this I think the planned 12 episodes will probably be extended. 16 or 18 episodes? Depends.\n\nTVN is really focusing on this show, I think they've been waving this to advertisers as a \"seasonal flagship show\" considering how \"safe\" this show is and how it panders to all the demographics.\n\nSafe to say it'll get a 3rd season. The question now is with the unwritten rule on TVN that a PD can't produce more than 3 seasons of a show. Will they break it for Jiraksil? Time will tell.\n\n[Article](https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/now/article/108/0003141306)",

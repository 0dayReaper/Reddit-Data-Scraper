ShinRok was quiet and reserved at first but seeing her have so much fun with the snow and then stealing and moving the containers around, even joking in the end when Yang Joong Gi got the chairman position was a welcome surprise. \n\nI am excited about IVE next ep because I like their songs and more importantly seen Yujin and a bit of Wonyoung in variety shows and know they can do pretty well. The preview hinted at maybe another team salary competition given the way Sechan and Jaesuk are seated in the front and the rest in those chairs. It worked out fine with the fighters because most of them were already experienced entertainers and were willing to make fun of themselves so given IVE gives off a completely diff vibe, I hope they do well. Also, I know it's already recorded but I pray Jaesuk and perhaps Haha limits the \"You're seriously very pretty\" comments because once is flattering, twice is distracting, but anymore and I worry the atmosphere will be awkward and they'll keep themselves in top idol group mode and make the episode boring. At the very least, the spy/rabbit with no liver will spice things up a bit.",

They looked so handsome. \n\n- This is why I like actors on running man. They quickly adapt, easily banter and even go above and beyond to cheat in the games. Also, she's gorgeous. \n\n- The game reminded me of one of my favorite moments of LKS and JSM, where she stole his container and ran outside the building bare feet \ud83d\ude02 and then he got a forehead slap for cheating. \ud83d\ude02\n\n- Haha and JSM are seriously so hilarious together. Please, we need more of these two. \n\n- Not sure if KSR is dating anyone, but I couldn't stop thinking how good she and KJK looked. Also age appropriate. \ud83d\ude01 (apparently she's married) \n\n- Go, JaeSuk, Go JaeSuk, Go! \ud83d\ude02 (surprise!)\n\n- Nice to see Hypeboy again.\n\n- JSM is a true writer. \ud83d\ude02 \n\n- cute how the caption said JSM was the daughter the chairman cherished the most. \n\n- Haha is a genius. I swear, him and SoMin are perfection during sketches. The random stuff they can come up with that just elevates everything is incredible. \n\n- Haha in the end when he answered the PDs question about the family motto had me laughing so much. He really was like a begger, \"give me money I answered correctly\" \ud83d\ude02 \n\n- it started out with Haha and JSM begging YJS for some money because their businesses were doing poorly, and ended with them begging for some money because they were broke and possessed by the gods of variety \ud83d\ude02\n\n- Kim Shin Rok is gorgeous, super smart and has such an interesting character. I think I am now officially a fan of hers. She even wrote a book. The way she carried herself was just so confident. She also had such good chemistry with most of the cast especially JSM, JSJ, YSC. \n\n- the family has two sets of twins. Does that happen? \n\n- good episode. Not much happened in the way of games, but thoroughly enjoyed it because of the cast, the opening role plays, and the \ud83d\udca9 luck of the usual suspects.",

No wonder she's an amazing actress. SoMin is the same. Her first guest appearance, it only took her the opening to get the hang of it. \n\nPeople like them are amazing actors because of this ability. I haven't seen KSR yet, but I suspect she's very good. The fact that they can just study a room, and immediately blend in even if it means stepping out of their comfort zone is incredible. \n\nSidenote: I've always wanted to be an actress. I've had theatre friends and was a theatre kid in highschool. This profession is all about studying humans and people. Even if they're introverts, they have the ability to step outside of themselves and become a character, separate from them irl.",

I feel so old for some reason. \ud83d\ude02 but also, I find it creepy that these super young kids are working as idols in a horrible industry. It is also going to probably be cringey watching this episode because of the generational differences; which is why I brought up the youngest members. The older RM members are like 40 years older than them. \ud83d\ude02 Sorry, but there is no way this is not gonna be awkward AF. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAlso, question: is it not usually the case where the whole group is under a label? Why only 1?\n\nEdit: \nY'all downvoting a comment that is against actual children being in an industry that exploits them and uses their innocence to attract creepy older men to drool over them is only proving my point. You're just perverted if you're anywhere over 20 years of age and a fan of a 14-15 year old girl. It's gross.",

She's not even 40, not for another 3 years and a few months. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Just that the kid is very young. Like it is so strange to me that kids that age are famous and popular and performing, and it's not just a random one person who was talented and gained fame or was a child star like Disney kids... This is the entire Kpop industry and their obsession with youth. \n\nI'm 29, idols my age are getting ready to retire! I find that ridiculous. Seeing groups like this where members are as young as 15 is just weird. When the youngest running man member is a lot older than one of the oldest group's members, then that gives me pause. \n\nI'll edit my comment to reflect this as I think people think I'm in any way insinuating JSM is old. I just don't think she would be super comfortable hanging out with people that much younger. I've been vocal about this issue (of really young idols or guest on the show or even in general in Kpop) and I don't like it. It's partially a joke when I say it's because they make me feel old. \n\nIt's mostly because I believe no 15 year old should be doing this. This industry is horrible, and even fully grown adults struggle in it. Let alone kids that young.",

It's insane when I was 14-15 doing stupid things and just having fun, these kids are being scrutinized and judged to a severe degree. Their good image is something they have to keep up for their entire lives even when they are no longer in the spotlight else they'll be labeled a disgrace or fallen or whatever. Madness.\n\nI also get that working with young kpop idols can be uncomfortable, especially when they're used to acting a certain way to banter with the experienced comedians and then have to tailor it to match the kpop idols without protecting them too much or it'll be uninteresting. It's a hard line to draw and I don't envy anybody who has to make it, least of all older female entertainers cuz you just KNOW some of those idols' fans will blast them for their behavior regardless. I read your other comment but figured it's easier to just lump it here in one comment for ease of access btw.\n\nLastly, I also want to reiterate I know you have no ill will in your original comment, just that the way it was phrased and the way the industry is, often frames it as detrimental at best and debilitating at worst. The second you're not super popular, have connections, or young and pretty, you are automatically screened off of many opportunities. This isn't necessarily tied down to gender as I see ample examples in men too but it's much more evident when you see who gets the commercials and how those headlines are phrased.\n\nIt's obvious in retrospect but it still happens because people are used to it and either don't know how or don't want to rock the boat. I guess that's why I latched onto your comment even knowing it was not malicious because I didn't want to perpetuate this idea that people who are of certain age, be pigeonholed into certain outdated types or be considered old because companies desperately want to overrate youth so they can sell their products better. So all in all, I get your points and just wanted to add my own about phrasing but went into a bit of rant about the industry instead.\n\nAside: I know you were partially joking but you're not old Ancient\\_Reply4583. The industry as it is will continuously pump out younger kids to replace the older ones and I see and hear too often people joking about feeling older only to realize they've started actually believing in it to a degree that they are put off from doing things \"not appropriate for their age\".",

I realize my comments sound very matter of factly and intense but only because I can't find better ways to explain things without having to go on long rants. \n\nBut I'm glad you brought it up because it gave me a chance to clear it up too. I'm the last person who will ever say anything about women over 30 being old or done. That's just not true. Especially not with JSM, she is in her prime. Not to mention the fact that she looks much younger and is a fabulous actress which means she can probably easily pull off playing those 20-something year old characters. \n\nIt's only the industry's loss that they're not giving women more chances. I'm vocal about this because I think RM is a good platform to invite older guests especially women. I have even said it a few times on Reddit that I think they should or if they want to add a new member, go for an older woman in her 40s or even 50s to match the men. \n\nI don't like the idea of RM adding a new member that's too young, and I don't like guests who are too young. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f So I think RM should invite guests close in age to most of the cast (SJH-Haha-KJK age range).

That's because everyone is worried not to cross any lines, they won't feel comfortable bantering with the guest (or the members on the guest's side), the jokes will ultimately end up being about this very apparent generational difference, they will treat the guests like kids (because they literally are)... There is already huge age differences between the RM maknaes and the other cast, but at least they're all grown adults so it's not that noticeable. \n\nMost of the very young guests on RM (think anyone born after 2000) have been underwhelming as the cast felt like they had to babysit them and they ended up not doing much. \n\nI think there have been very few exceptions to this, but those cases are rare and depend on the personality of the people. I can't come up with many, the only one I can come up with is Young Ji (rapper), I think she was born in '02. \n\nCompare these kids to guests who are close in age to RM cast or even in their 20s (mid to late). Tell me there isn't a glaring huge difference. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

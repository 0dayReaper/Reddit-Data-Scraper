    "postText": "'Peak Time' is a brand-new idol competition program in which teams battle for the chance to become the next worldwide idol group. Unlike other audition programs, its contestants consist entirely of male idols who have already debuted, whether currently active or part of a disbanded group.\n\nOnly the top 6 finalists would be able to reveal their group name on the show, and those 6 teams would be participating in a \u201cPeak Time\u201d concert tour. The final winner will receive a grand prize of 300 million won (approximately $232,932), as well as the opportunity to release a new album and hold a global showcase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Round 2 Combined Unit Match Round:**\n\nA training camp was held for 3 days and 2 nights. During the training camp, they will prepare for round 2. Out of the 16 teams, 4 teams become one combined team. Each team will form a vocal, dance, and rap unit. The vocal unit must have a maximum of 6 members. The rap unit must have a maximum of 5 members. The dance unit does not have a maximum number of members. The units of the four teams will compete. The winning unit of each position will be selected by the judges.\n\nThe winner of each match earns 2% of the total votes. The MVP of each unit will receive 5% of the total votes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Team|Members|\n|:-|:-|\n|Team A|9:00 (&gt;!BLITZERS!&lt;), 2:00 (&gt;!NTX!&lt;), 18:00 (&gt;!BDC!&lt;), and 5:00 (&gt;!ATBO!&lt;)|\n|Team B|20:00 (&gt;!M.O.N.T!&lt;), 8:00 (&gt;!DKB!&lt;), 21:00 (&gt;!24K!&lt;), and 23:00 (&gt;!DGNA!&lt;)|\n|Team C|11:00 (&gt;!VANNER!&lt;), 13:00 (&gt;!BAE173!&lt;), 15:00 (&gt;!BLK!&lt;), and 24:00 (&gt;!Soloists\\*!&lt;)|\n|Team D|7:00 (&gt;!MASC!&lt;), 14:00 (&gt;!GHOST9!&lt;), 4:00 (&gt;!BXB!&lt;), and 1:00 (&gt;!DIGNITY!&lt;)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Unit|Performance|Score|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Rap Unit - Team A|[If I Die Tomorrow (orig.

The amount of talent on Peak Time really makes you realise that making it in the kpop industry isn't about talent at all. It's about luck, timing, and above all, the agency you sign with. \n\nThe dance teams killed it. All the performances were powerful and any one of them could have won. The scores tell the same story - some teams are separated by just one point. \n\nHonestly I like this show a lot more than Boys Planet. Mnet's editing ruins everything. Splicing reactions that are over-the-top, and sometimes don't seem to match the respective performances really spoils the viewing experience for me.",

Of course that is probably a given the BP trainees haven\u2019t had as much vocal training as these already debuted teams. It\u2019s so much more comfortable as a viewer to watch these performances without holding my breath waiting for strained notes/cracked voices.",

And the second Heejae started My sea it was the same. The tone, skill and range aside, is sooo pleasing to hear and I\u2019m so happy they won. \n\nI absolutely love this show. Everyone is just so good. The dance performances were amazing and I was actually surprised team A was in last place because it was my favorite. Just concept and choreography wise it fit the most smooth. But still, everyone could\u2019ve won because they were all great. Very sad to go to eliminations now.",

It feels very youthful and trendy. The other is very smooth, has great grooves, synchronisation, and sexy vibe. They are all great, although my fave is &gt;!team B!&lt; but still happy for the team that won \ud83d\ude2d\n\nOverall I feel like I really like Peak Time because some of these idols are seasoned performers. Even the ones that are newbies are talented and they perform really well! It\u2019s like they are more mature performers, I guess this is why I like this show better.\nAnd my heart hurts to think only 6 teams can participate on the concert tour?? \ud83d\ude2d \nSo far I really like team 8, 23, 11, 20, 13 and how can I not like Jongup?",

And expected My Sea really did not disappoint. &gt;!Totally deserved the win!&lt;\n\nThe dance though. All 4 teams were soooo good like it actually made me replay all of them because once isnt enough for each peformance. B was definitely my fav because of how smooth smooth it was and I am a sucker for this kind of performance. And D1 is cute \ud83e\udee0\n\nKinda not really happy with how the eliminations is going to go. Giving them a new song but they might not even be able to perform it because they got eliminated. (Might be wrong but that is what I understood from the teaser) All the hard work given to the song gone just like that :/",

EVERY SINGLE ONE did so well and worked hard to show off their routines; I found that each of the themes that were picked fit their respective groups well and there weren't any huge flaws from any one of them.\n\nMy personal first place was &gt;!Team B!&lt; since I had the most fun with theirs and they felt the most like a dance team (dynamic). That said, huge congratulations to &gt;!Team C!&lt; for winning and although it wasn't my fav, I can definitely see their appeal and agree they had the most beautiful lines out of the groups. I'm just glad the differences b/w each of the dance teams weren't too big, meaning they all smashed it and it came down to preferences and minor details. As for the dreaded voting and elimination taking place next, well, I'm just glad we got so much wholesome fun before getting to the nitty grittiness of survival shows. The votes so far haven't moved too much so depending on how significant those extra benefit votes are, I'm pretty sure those in the top 10 are safe (which are luckily where my picks are placed). Fingers crossed for the voting but since I'm just here for the perfs, I hope they don't drag it out too much so they can quickly get to the next round of battles.",

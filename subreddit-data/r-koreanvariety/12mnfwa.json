It was difficult setting with the combination of casts and snowy environment but after each episode I can see the increased bonding between members. \n\nIn this particular episode, I loved the \"telapathy\" game so much. So far I haven't this game with my limited interest in Kvariety shows, so it was a new to me and I totally loved, especially when everyone were getting greedy.",

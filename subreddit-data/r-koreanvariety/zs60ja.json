WW just need to win by +2 goals to avoid being dropped. If WW win by +2 goals, both Ana and WW would have 1 win, 2 losses, and GD -2 but in this case, WW won the head-to-head, therefore placing WW higher than Ana.",

If Anaconda play they way they play the last two games, their probabilities of winning and earning  a chance for Super League will be higher. They just basically have to win, even with a shoot-out, that will guarantee them a chance to move up. Unless WW figures out how to channel their wild energies into a game plan, it will just turn into a wild game for them, like when they played Bullabang. And I doubt that will happen. They will rage out, and that will give a better chance for a stable team like Ana to defeat them. Sorry WW, they will need to comeback with So Hee (after her album promotion) and JooMyung to compete after next season.",

Just like season 1, keeper tossed/kicked the ball upfront, then the strikers figured it out themselves. Zombie soccer was brought back. I guess they just figure it as a quick solution to not lose the game. FC Gavenger strength is build up game and don't know why they abandoned that especially when the average quality of your players  are subpar. That's why you stretched out the field and look for opportunity. This style of play only work for Bullabang because of the physical nature and style of their strikers (like Gucheok and Actionista). That's why these teams are having problem containing team like World Class and Top Girl.",

But as usual their Achilles heel is basically a GK and PK shootouts which is the **supreme** weapon of &gt;!Gaevengers!&lt; - They're literally stole games by PK shootouts from Actionista, Nat Fam, Giants, W Woman and Fire Moths despite of being sloppy at late games.\n\n\n* It's not coincidence for &gt;!Kim Hye Sun!&lt; to score that banger, she's been trying to do that since last season. They have a big chance to win it thru &gt;!Oh Na Mi!&lt; but seems like since last season her finishing touches became blunt, but still her speed and getting the good receiving spot from passes still there so she can surprise the defensive end of opposition.

However for team like Gaevenger\u2019s iffy defense and abysmal offense, you don\u2019t want to **only** rely on stolen plays at transition and pray not to hit the post and drag it to PK shootouts - you can\u2019t do that all of the time. I wish Coach L. Young Pyo transform them as dynamic team that can plays defense while having threatening offense like Actionista - they have a size, speed and height.\n\n\nFor me they had a chance to win it swiftly if they hadn\u2019t miss chances. Well win is win since H2H is lifeline tho goals is really matter by the time of closing end of group stages in case of tied up. If you manage a draw it means your GD is only ended at 0 since GD is also lifeline here you want that number so high.",

They set out to win, but against stronger opponents, their lack of stamina and playmaking ends up causing them to hang on to a draw until the final whistle.\n\nThey usually come out strong in the 1st half but they lack stamina (except for Hye Sun) in the 2nd half. This severely limits their offensive plays in the 2nd half.\n\nAlso Nami is kinda a glass cannon as she is injury prone. Her performance tend to suffer after she gets taken down in the game.\n\nThey also lack a playmaker in the team, one that has vision of the field and can pass into space to enable Nami. Also Gav players (particularly Min Jeong and Seung Hye) dribbles while looking at their feet or pass without looking. Which is why a lot of their offensive plays end up getting cut.\n\nPersonally I find that Byungji style of built up play with tiki-taka passing really worked well for Gav (since it negates the need for a playmaker in the team) and that was when they dominated season 2. I am not sure how Young Pyo plan to shape Gav but he needs to address the stamina and playmaking issues IMO.\n\nHye Ryun is one of the best GK and the only 'thinking' GK in the show. Other top GKs (like Irene and Ayumi) relies on their reaction. Hye Ryun actually thinks as she reacts. An unfortunate example is PSY kick-in goal in this match, Hye Ryun is probably the only GK that will make note of that fact not to touch the ball if it goes in from kick-in (other GKs will just choose to block it regardless). Unfortunately in this instance, the ball just barely brushed pass Eun Hyeong's head and is considered a touch which Hye Ryun did not see.\n\nAnother example is how she positions herself during PK shootouts. She will ever so slightly position herself off-centre to bait the kicker into shooting to the wider side. This allows her to anticipate the shot better and win the shootout.\n\nAll in all, I guess I am trying to say that while Gav set out to win, their weakness make it difficult for them to close out the game against better opponents. But despite that, they are still able to hold the stalemate long enough to get to PK shootout and win. That is a testament of their ability as a team. But as the skill level of the league improves, their inability to close out games will eventually drag them down.",

A. Hye Kyung just got caught napping in this match, not aware that K. Hye Sun and K. Seung Hye can shoot from mid.\n\n\nThat's how they got relegated on first place against Fire Moth, Ha Seok Ju focus the Fire Moth on defense and going low because they can't match speed obviously at least a saturated defense and not over extending; plus putting P. Ha Na on front letting P. Sun Yeong going from high to defensive position strengthen their defense+midfield and supporting also S. Dong Ju on her pressing. Which is basically parked the bus after scoring 1-0, they knew that PK is so risky to them. Gaevenger try to salvage it on same routine of pressing to got the broken plays and set piece but no avail due to 4 players rotation at covering the box. ( Eun Yeong, Dong Ju, Sun Yeong and Hyo Bum).",

I really don't think they will get any better than they are right now.  EunHyeong being the weakest of all players in the league. NaMi being their \"ace\" that really isn't that great.  SeungHye and HyeSun relegated to defense when perhaps they can be better offensive players.  And on top of that you're hoping for a HyeRyun that doesn't have a massive brain fart and making dumb mistakes as goalkeeper.",

Her only positive is that she is a decent and powerful kick taker. \n\nEun Hyeong is probably the least improve player overall. Her entire purpose on the team is an extra body to sub in for Min Keong or Nami to rest.\n\nThese 2 players need to change or improve, otherwise they are gonna have more trouble keeping up with the other teams.\n\n\n&gt;Their roster at the moment hit its ceiling.\n\nHye Sun still have potential to improve her skills. This match Young Pyo letting her take some kick-ins showed that it is something that they are working on. The accuracy and distance at the moment leaves much to be desired, but in time, it will be a great addition to their arsenal. Having 2 good kick takers add so much more versatility to the team, kinda like Action with Hein and Yeojin.\n\nSeung Hye has shown steady improvement and glimpses of talent at being a playmaker / offensive mid. If she is able improve her vision on the field and pass accuracy, Gav will have more options on the offense.",

Anaconda is possibly my fav team and Wonder Woman has some fav members of mine on it so seeing other suspended would suck, big time. That is assuming they are truly suspended and you don't see them until the season after next. IMO that's stupid and I doubt many members would stay \"on\" the show, train a bunch and half a year later not be busy with something else so they can't come back.",

However, I also think part of the reason she may be getting more hate than the rest is because people view her presence on the show as a product of favoritism. Let's look into the sequence of events. Warning: long reply incoming.\n\nYJS has her added to HDYP. He recruits her, out of so many other juniors, into Antenna. She gets a pass during the first round of WSG wannabe auditions even though they eliminated other singers who were stronger vocalists than her. All of these things were slowly building up against her. Then the news comes out that she gets to stay when most of the other members will be removed. We can't say she vastly outshined the rest so the public once again smells bias in her favor. At that point the hate has already built up against her, and that wave continues even with this new update that only two members are being let go.\n\nNow, I've said this before but I do blame YJS for some of this. I don't mean that his intentions are malicious. But he does have a tendency to go overboard when it comes to supporting certain friends or juniors. On one hand, it gives them a huge boost if they're able to properly utilize it. On the other hand, it can backfire when the entertainer isn't able to branch out properly.\n\nAnd on that note, we get to her solo release. Her most relevant project right now is HDYP and that's clearly not doing her any favors in terms of public perception. Her solo release was a chance to show the GP that she can stand on her own two feet. I also think it would have helped shift her image from female idol to strong soloist, which would be a positive transition. But her solo didn't make enough of a splash and she also caught COVID in the midst of promotions.\n\nA final point I want to make is that while some of the criticism towards Mijoo is unfair and I do feel bad for her, it doesn't mean all of it is. Viewers are allowed to dislike her performance or presence on the show, just as they are allowed to dislike any member's performance or presence on the show. We can't conveniently attribute all of it to misogyny.",

Viewers were disgruntled about HDYP no longer being a solo gig. There were accusations flying around that the new members were only casted due to connections. That was immediately followed by news of Mijoo signing with YJS's agency, which became another indicator of possible favoritism towards her and, consequently, another strike against her. Not that it warrants her getting hate, but the timing wasn't very favorable.",

The whole WSG project is another show of lack of consideration by the production team, because neither Mijoo nor Bong Sun should have ever been asked to audition for the project. Especially Mijoo as an idol, if she were to be disqualified it would\u2019ve made her look bad at her main career, and when she was passed we saw the negative consequence. It was a lose-lose where Mijoo was put in a bad situation. For Antenna, I really think people go overboard. Just because they\u2019re the same agency doesn\u2019t automatically give a reason to discredit every job she gets when that clearly isn\u2019t enough of a reason for her to be hired. People can dislike celebrities but imo you definitely cannot discount misogyny\u2019s role in this. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s always much worse for female celebrities and you don\u2019t see the many, many male celebrities in similar situations get nearly as much of their talent discredited or get as much hate for small things. And it\u2019s especially more obvious when you see comments accusing mijoo of &gt;!being YJS\u2019s girlfriend or dumb stuff like that!&lt; which a man would never get.",

A sausage party of 45-55 year olds.

I still believe that what this show really need is just a competent PD, someone who knows what he/she is doing, someone with a clear direction of show in mind. \n\nThey should completely kick out that PD, him just going behind the scenes would not do anything for this show.",

The loveline was non-existent for months on the show but since Mijoo and Yikyung were recently trending a lot on social media and gained so much popularity because of their interactions outside HDYP (award show, Kim Hyuna's Youtube channel), the PD force started it again in the latest episode which is why people got mad. The show never pushed the loveline it was mostly just Mijoo and Yikyung hard carrying but they're trying to bank off it since it's the only trending topic HDYP gets these days. Now that the loveline is attached again to HDYP's bad reputation the haters are targeting Mijoo and Yikyung as well for no reason.",

As someone who likes Shin Bong-sun, but dislikes music and observational shows this was one of the rare eng subbed things I got to watch her in. \n\nHappy Yi-kyung and Jin-joo are staying, but it's so rare for a female comedian to get a regular spot on a show this big that it really stings to see her leave. Especially since she likely left other shows for this opportunity. \n\nAnyway, watch Bong-sun and Yi-kyung's tennis variety show! It has no english subs and the viewership ratings are terrible (so it's probably only a matter of time until it gets cancelled), but it's honestly been a blast so far! I really hope it beats the odds and continues on!\n\n(It also makes me really wish they made more use of the Yikyung x Bong-sun dynamic on HDYP, but that's a whole other post.)\n\nLink: [https://www.ondemandkorea.com/en/player/vod/winning-shot-for-tomorrow](https://www.ondemandkorea.com/en/player/vod/winning-shot-for-tomorrow)",

They were casted less than a year ago and are very well liked among viewers. They have a lot of potential and created many viral social media clips for HDYP in nine months while the show has been on the rocks rating-wise.",

Hopefully the next team can save the show since many episodes really felt like the PD's own personal project with no direction and was very random. I'm halfway the latest episode and it's really enjoyable but it's a rare one. I've been an avid viewer of HDYP and for me to skip episodes completely is really something. \n\nAs for JJH, quite expected since I never really felt like he blended in anyway. It could be the age gap? Idk. It's a pity that Mina is going too. She's good and it just feels like they fail to find a concept that fits her, slowly pushing her into the shadow. \n\nI'm glad that Leekyung is staying because he's funny. But it also lowkey feels weird now because they now have 3 juniors and 2 seniors, with the juniors being pretty new to variety. Lowkey feels like a mini mentorship program or something? I'm curious to see how this goes. Hopefully they can strike a balance.",

This is kind of the least drastic outcome aside from keeping all 7 members, and we\u2019ll see what YJS-Haha-LYK-PJJ-LMJ will look like as a five man team and if the chemistry will be there. While I like them individually, I\u2019m not fully bought into that combination, and SBS is a loss because she can create funny moments. We\u2019ll also see how much of HDYP\u2019s lacking really came from PCH under the new direction of these 2 new PDs, hopefully it\u2019s not more of the same considering they were there under PCH too.",

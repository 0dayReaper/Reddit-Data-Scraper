Third time's the charm haha and he looks so heartbroken oh nos.\n\nI find Jinyoung funny as a character and the panelists aren't wrong when they say he's like the prince of the island hahaha I can see why the girls are so smitten with him; he has mysterious vibes. Nadine, why didn't you go walk with Sejeong and Jinyoung? She said that there's only two seats but then it cut to a sofa and two armchairs LOL\n\nSoE looks so much better without her bangs, and I appreciated that she's so clear about her feelings. It takes a certain kind of courage and I admire her for that.\n\nHanbin and Seoeun look good imo. I didn't really vibe with Yoongjae and Seoeun, but this ship gives me good feels. They look super cute waving to each other! The difference between Hanbin and Seoeun vs. Jinyoung and Seulki and the bags tho HAHA Seulki, please consider Jungwoo.\n\nDongwoo and Nadine; I was surprised when they match but I guess there was *something* since ep one. The age gap is a concern for me; she's younger than Seulki who already found Dongwoo a bit too much. I don't blame him; he's probably looking for a wife or longterm relationship but the girls don't feel the same.\n\nI cannot get over Yoongjae and his big ass scientist glasses and oversized button down HAHA he looks so much better without the glasses and I like that he did what Soyeon did in Season One (choosing someone who wouldn't choose him). Unfortunately, Seoeun didn't get the memo\n\nSoE and Sejeong oh nos! Their faces when they realised it was the end of the matching. Poor girls; it's the second time being unmatched. This episode feels more heartbreaking than the previous one; the four people literally look like they're going to burst into tears.\n\n... Jungwoo's guesses were freaking hilarious HAHA he's so off but he looked so earnest with his predictions. I think he's my favourite male contestant now and I really hope he'll go to Paradise (with the girl he likes, of course!)\n\nAww man SoE nooo even the panellists were sad for her. I don't get her attraction for Yoongjae but she's nothing but persistent. Two personal talks in one day is a tad too much honestly and it's very clear that he doesn't feel the same. I have been in Yoongjae's position and it does feels like a bit of a burden to hear all this from someone you seriously aren't attracted to even if they say don't feel pressured.\n\nThe previews wow! A merry-go-round? \"Can I cross the line?\" Jungwoo and Dongwoo. Seulki noOOO",

I honestly feel like the other girls (especially Seulgi) are trying too hard to be likeable (sorry but the aegyo style isn't for everyone). \n\nAlso So-e needs to give up bc obviously she won't be reciprocated based on his body language and responses. But kudos to her for being honest, at least.\n\nIdk, the men this season so far are pretty meh. Almost all of them are the type to not be open to meeting other people and are just focused on how pretty the women are. But it's only been 3 days anyway, no expectation tho. \n\nThe new guy is also a big turnoff based on his actions. I know he has the bad boy vibe who doesn't give a damn, but it comes off as cocky and rude to me. But the girls might be drawn to that type tho.",

You just can't force feelings that aren't there...\n\nWhat is it about Seul ki (other than beauty) that's melting the guys?  I find her aloof, distant and utterly poor in conversations.",

His 3 secs decision right there at the bag incident.  He wishes he did not pick her I bet.

The panel has an influence on how viewers think too. \n\nThis panel is always nice. \n\nLike eg when Seul-ki and Dongwoo had an awkward convo, they repeated that she just wants to take it slow. This makes us viewers understand that she has her reasons for not being very enthusiastic when speaking with Dongwoo. It\u2019s a very realistic reason and although it makes Dongwoo feel bad, sometimes you just can\u2019t help the way you feel. In real life we also have awkward conversations with people that we don\u2019t have much in common with. That\u2019s totally normal! \n\nSo far most of the comments on this sub has been mostly civil and not name calling or trying to hate on certain cast members\u2026 but there are still some not so nice words being said elsewhere on reddit. \n\nHope people realise that this show is with real people with real emotions. Even if they don\u2019t come to reddit, the comments can influence people to go to their instagram and leave hurtful comments.",

Seo Eun and Joong Jae would be my go-to choices in their respective genders because of how natural they are, always willing to learn about others and lend an attentive ear to the opposite party. coming at second is Hanbin for his laidback, sincere and cheery demeanor which is sadly eclipsed by his height. \n\nthe rest are pretty vanilla to me, esp Seulki who increasingly bores me with her mundanely stilted expressions. you can be demure and all but shes too passive for my taste. but i guess she fits the stereotypical traditional woman that Asian guys will usually swoon over.",

I thought he was just trying really hard to get a conversation going and had to think of questions to ask. Seul-ki gave short answers and hardly asks questions back. Or when he clarifies her question, she just trails off and doesn\u2019t answer.. \n\nShe mentioned that her low energy shows when she\u2019s really tired but that excuse is not valid for during breakfast at Paradise as she would\u2019ve been more well rested. I think she was just not interested in Dongwoo. Will see how she\u2019s like with the new guy! \n\nI\u2019m also surprised that Seo eun and Yoongjae had to share a room. So he saw her bareface? And they would know each other\u2019s sleeping habits like snoring? or teeth grinding? Don\u2019t think I can get a good rest when I\u2019m conscious of the other person. \n\nHonestly so far I don\u2019t see any couple with good chemistry yet.. We\u2019ll see!",

Would be kind of interesting and funny to see how Jungwoo handles her lack of interest and initiative in conversations (in comparison to how Dongwoo handled it) if he somehow ends up going to Paradise with her later on. But I feel like Jungwoo might switch up if a new girl comes along. I hope so for his sake.

He wasn't out of line at all, even though he can't read a room to save his life.  I find Seul Ki to be socially awkward in general, even when she was with Jung Woo.  Dong Woo and Seul Ki are  just not a good fit.  He might vibe better with Nadine since she seems more receptive to Dong Woo creating conversation.",

He may come to regret but who cares, you have moved on.\n\nSojeong: Very pretty and sweet too. Looks sexy too. Strange she\u2019s often overlooked. Shows that Korean men likes sweet cute things like Seulki which is quite puzzling.\n\nSeulki: I think she is not that one dimensional as people claimed but maybe not interested? I think she can talk if she is interested. Actually i find her so-so in terms of looks, i do not get the appeal actually. Maybe she looks demure? \n\nSeo eun: A totally beautiful and wholesome girl. I\u2019ll go for her too. Work for it, Yoong Jae! \n\nDong Woo: I like doctors. If i know his occupation beforehand, I\u2019d have eyes for no one else. Move aside, Yj! \n\nYJ: I\u2019d pick him too first if i were amongst the girls. But i will not be too hard up if he were to pick someone else. He\u2019s not the only tree in the forest. \n\n\nNot interested in others yet.",

Same with Nadine, they both have not shown a real personality yet imo. \n\n- I'm surprised Se Jeong is not picked, she stood out to me as the most confident plus most beautiful girl at the start. But I guess that's a Western view, as Korean guys seem to prefer more shy and \"innocent\" looking girls.\n\n- I also felt Han Bin was picked only as Seo Eun kind of pitied him and liked him for bringing a good vibe to the group.\n\n- The new guy is the definition of handsome but empty so far.\n\n- I liked how they have different jobs than being influencer or model like in most reality shows.\n\n- The mutual respect and calmness of all of them is a nice change coming from watching American dating shows. Like after the tug of war the guy who won immediately helped the one who lost. They don't gossip much  (or it is not shown) and generally treat each other kindly. \n\n- The meals they cook look delicious.",

Idk how she's still putting herself out there after that. I found it kinda hard to watch, especially when Youngjae kept her on the hook at the end. I was kinda hoping she would stop pursuing him.\n\nDefinitely felt that Seulki was not into Dongwoo on their paradise date. Tbh I felt like the age gap between the two was kinda clear too. He was going all in on her and she wasn't vibing, which I completely understand after 2 days. I was kinda surprised she's only 25 tbh, I thought she'd be a bit older. lnteresting to see how her demeanor completely changed when Jinyoung entered. I don't find him particularly interesting, but I know some women love that type of cold, mysterious guy and he was adorable when he smiled. &gt;!Also lmaoo she's going swimming with him in the trailer after refusing to swim with Dongwood!&lt;\n\nThis season is falling into the same pattern as season one with the men consistently choosing the women that fit the Korean beauty standards though. Like cmon, Sejeong is gorgeous and athletic, which some of the guys mentioned they were after, but still no trip to paradise.",

            "comment": "Here to add onto the few that have said Dongwoo didn't seem to be that aggressive, because he really wasn't. Was him being tipsy detrimental to him reading the room more and impacted how he responded? Yeah, but all those questions were legit questions to ask in a dating show that only lasts like a week. It definitely felt like Seulki chose him because it was an easy Paradise ticket and she didn't really care for the others. If I was Dongwoo, minus the drinking personally, I would just be as frustrated/disappointed by her complete lack of responses. We're there for over 10 hrs and all you're going to say is \"I don't know, I guess, maybe, it's a bit of both, etc?\" I get that she can be honest about wanting to take things slow but given how easily she moved onto Jinyoung, the whole Dongwoo Paradise date felt even more awkward; it felt like she just didn't want to put in the effort to make the experience somewhat comfortable for the other person. Contrast this to Seoeun, who is bubbly, full of life, and acts nice to everyone but doesn't necessarily lead anyone on. I don't think she chose Hanbin because she felt bad for him, but more so that she genuinely wants to give him a chance, even if I think she vibed with Youngjae more.\n\nI get that it's hard for some who may be more socially awkward (I am one myself) but there comes a point where you kind of have to put yourself out there, especially if you joined a show whose premise hinges on you doing so. You can still be true to yourself and not sour the experience for others. This is why I'm so confused as to why Seulki's on equal footing (popularity-wise) with Seoeun. If I was a guy there, I'd immediately have good feelings towards Seoeun and Nadine, the two who are pretty sure of themselves and treat the show as a fun way to experience new things. While Seoeun will def have her pick of guys, I just feel quite bad for Seyoung, So-e, and Nadine for needing to control their feelings over constantly being ignored even if they know it's a part of the deal in joining the show. Still not sure if Dongwoo is sincere about Nadine so hopefully ~~Dex~~ Jinyoung will at least give it a solid go getting to know the other three even if I get the feeling he's not here for love so much as a good time.",

Their conversation was also really boring with him being more interested than her. \n\nAlso I feel So Eun hasn\u2019t really decided on who she really likes. She seems like the kind that will make friends with everybody. She probably also see YongJae as just a friend for the time being. That\u2019s why she chose Han bin.

Seems like fans are annoyed at her for the same reasons they were for Jia. \n\nChoi Seo Eun - Kang Soyeon, bc both are confident, mature, and have interesting careers besides the typical model, YouTuber, personal trainer, student, etc. that many Korean dating shows have. Also seems like Seo Eun is the fan fave of this season much like Soyeon was. \n\nLee So E - Shin Jiyeon, mainly bc both represent the cute, soft, passive member in a pool of hot members that don\u2019t really pay attention to them much. \n\nPark Se Jeong - An Yea Won in that they\u2019re both tan, stunning, forward and overlooked by the men, leaving viewers confused. Although I think Yeawon was a lot more bubbly. Also seems like she\u2019s gearing up to be a fan fave for this season. \n\nChoi Jung Woo - Choi Si Hun bc mans can\u2019t read the room and both are oblivious af.

(In the first ep/trailer, there\u2019s a clip of someone who looks like YJ leaning down on the bed to give someone a kiss? Hope it\u2019s Seo-Eun.\n\n- Love that YJ stayed in Inferno in hopes that So Eun would too. Cute. I don\u2019t blame Seo-Eun for going back to Paradise with Hanbin she\u2019s just trying to get to know others and that\u2019s fair. I also don\u2019t blame Yoongjae for not picking So-E he really doesn\u2019t have any feelings for her and she just can\u2019t take a hint.\n\n- The new guy (Jinyoung?) has no manners lmfao. He didn\u2019t stand up when the girls we\u2019re approaching him for lunch. And he didnt even offer to carry Seulgi\u2019s bags lmfao. She had to ask him. LMFAO\n\n- I like Hanbin. I\u2019m rooting for him, but I don\u2019t know about him and Seo-Eun. I\u2019ll keep my mind open and look forward to their Paradise trip. But honestly think he should go for So-E. (Maybe I\u2019m just biased hahaha)\n\n- Justice for Sejeong. She\u2019s gorgeous. I have a feeling she might end up as the Yeawon of this season but it\u2019s too early to tell LOL.\n\n- Nadine and new guy\u2026 hmm. I think it could work.\n\n\n\nI actually like this season so far. I\u2019ll keep watching. I did skip through some of the panel scenes though\u2026 their comments are so unnecessary sometimes.",

Like OBVIOUSLY Jinyoung was going to win that because he was coming in completely fresh, while everyone else just blew their backs out. Like, everyone else was probably tired, sore, overheating, and expended a shit ton of energy, so they were at a huge disadvantage. It was so blatantly unfair, and yet everyone was going ham for it. Like... I KNOW the other male contestants were fuming because I would be lol.",

Taesool is good but he\u2019s a little slow and doesn\u2019t have the stamina to last a full game. \n\nTaebum is still a lil shaky \ud83d\ude02. Je-un is good as a center back, I feel like Andre and Jangkun have good physicals but still need a lot of help defense tactic wise.\n\nLol sorry for the spill I just feel like if they recruited more and better defensive players it\u2019ll make the midfield players especially the offensive midfielders better because they don\u2019t always have to rush to cover an error the defense made.\n\nPlus Minho has changed positions too much bc of lack of players due to conflict of schedules but it messes up his flow.\n\nI may not be an ex professional player like the coaches but I played soccer for a couple years enough to know that even though Minho is good at defense it\u2019s not where they can utilize him the most.",

                            "comment": "&gt; Taebum should be a defender \n\nHe can't be a defender. Not strong/disciplined enough to be CB, and nowhere near enough stamina to be played as RB because Jung-hwan definitely wants the side to run up and down. We saw this the few times he played as RB instead of Min-ho and the difference is so huge. If Tae-bum is the RB, he'd get smoked by the opponents very easily. Min-ho is exactly being played as RB to prevent/reduce this kind of scenario.\n\n&gt; Jangkun would be better as a wing in my opinion I don\u2019t think they gave him enough time as a forward to understand his position but he\u2019s back upfront now I believe in the Raw episodes.\n\nWithout meaning to be rude, but Jang-kun just doesn't really have good football IQ. He is the one player that I'm most frustrated at because the physical body and skill is there, but he doesn't know how to use it properly.\n\n* His decision making is slow. Pay attention when he's passing a long ball. He'd receive the original pass. He'd pause and hold the ball. He'd look down to see where the ball is on the ground. He'd then look up to see where he's going to pass it to. Then he'd kick the ball to make the long pass. All of that doesn't sound that long, but it's long enough to allow opponent's defense to react. Either to close him down and put pressure, or to read the pass and try to intercept. Ideally, he's supposed to already know who/where he's going to pass the ball to before he received the pass, and once he receives the pass, he should be able to kick the ball without having to look at the ground first. \n\n* His positioning is not great. When he was playing as a forward and during counter-attack, he often either ran to his teammates to ask for the ball or to wait until his teammates are ready. What he's supposed to do is run towards the empty spot. This will either drag a defender to go with him there (which means it'll free up space for his teammate to attack), or he'd be in an empty spot where his teammate can pass to. When he is a defender, he is often dragged out of position which in turn makes Andre/Je-un having to cover more. \n\n&gt; Andre\n\nAndre Andre Andre. The only big flaw he has is the urge to go forward. If that's removed, he'd be among the best players in the team. Unfortunately for Avengers, he's already currently the best CB they have. Jang-kun is too clueless while Je-un is too quiet.",

They're already technically capable enough (for their level) that extra individual training will only improve them by a little bit. Video session to visually see what they did wrong and what they were supposed to be doing instead would've helped much more. \n\n\nInstead of a basic \"You should've done this\" comment, they could've been more detailed:\n\n* This is what you did wrong\n\n* This is wrong because ...\n\n* The right thing to do was ... \n\n* Doing the right thing would've ...\n\n* You made the same mistake again 5 minutes later\n\n* This cost the team ... \n\n* If you had done the right thing, we could've done ...\n\nAnd so on. I think most players have a rough idea of what they did wrong, but it's different to self-guess what they did wrong because they couldn't be too aware of what they did. Reviewing the video would've given them so much more information and it would stick with them more.",

Yo Han is ok but he could be better. \n\nThe team has some really good players aces if you will, then they have the ones that are supposed to show growth and improvement throughout the series, then they have the ones that have pretty stable performances, then they have the ones who don\u2019t have good soccer sense but have some good days on the field.",

Heo Minho has consistently been one of the team's great players but unlike other great players on the team (Nam-kyu &amp; Eun-gyoo) instead of getting rewarded for his contributions by being put in a stable position as mid-fielder like he has asked before from the coaches, he has to be willing to be placed at any unfilled position at games' notice. on one side it's a testament of the coach's trust on him to be jack of all trades but on the other side the coaches aren't being fair to him. \n\nthe crux of the matter imo is the coaches' unwillingness to lose. they are just too competitive that they aren't willing to withstand losing due to the players still learning about their positions or if the players aren't showing commitment to rapidly grow in their assigned positions. like Jangkun for ex, he is built to be a striker and nothing but striker imo but he's not growing as fast as he should bcoz myb he's a slow learner or he didn't practice much in his personal time like Heo Minho or etc. so he get assigned to be defense player where he's just mediocre and likely to stay mediocre. instead i think he and others shld be left at the position they want to be in even if it means the club losing more than winning.  \n\nimo the show is okay but stagnant bcoz they are missing the whole point of amateur morning soccer club: conquering other morning soccer clubs around the country or the world is not the main point it's the consistent togetherness during happy and tough times. they may get higher rating if the members are willing to share more of their personal times for ex how and with whom are they practicing in their personal times, myb bring their family members sometimes, or myb the members or the crew can record the routines or the activities of other amateur soccer clubs members instead of only showing n introducing them during the vs game.",

I get that they\u2019re trying to conquer amateur soccer or whatever.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s cause there were a lot of older members. \n\nI feel like the first season had more personal times. They truly enjoyed playing soccer together. Even if the skill level was low during the first season, they got the point of amateur morning soccer clubs. There were a lot of times when I laughed with them. I felt for them. \n\nI agree with OP here in the replies as well. I remember during the first season when they went on a vacation after a competition. I enjoyed watching all the cast have fun doing water activities and eating. But even there was a surprise soccer match. Obviously, they lost because all of them were tired. But I can\u2019t even imagine doing those activities and eating a lot, suddenly playing a whole soccer game. Overall, I enjoyed the first season more.\n\n\nThat\u2019s just my rant about the show.",

Which is no doubt frustrating for the players because it comes off as favoritism for the strikers.\n\nIf I remember correctly Daehoon, Junho, Hyeonwoo, Minho, Chilku, and even Junhyeon have been overlooked for MOM a couple times for the strikers/forwards even though they were doing all the movement, stealing, passing, and pressuring. \n\nHahhhhhhh just typing this is making my blood boil \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude2d",

Maybe the recent success of shows like Physical 100 and even Steel Troops with all the emotional scenes, showing camaraderie, etc. can give clues.\n\nSometimes, I feel like Coach Ahn is aiming for them to get to K4 someday if it\u2019s possible haha. I mean they are/were pro-athletes and he can switch players until he gets there. In the last episode some of the tryout contenders were born in the 2000s.

Minho really thrives in the midfield and seeing him stagnate being stuck in the defense is so painful and I think the coaches see it too.\n\nI would make this argument for Junhyeon as well, honestly. At some point his confidence just tanked as he became less involved in offense. Junhyeon comes alive during his overlaps and unfortunately it looks like he's been in a slump on that front, too.\n\nHopefully we get some solid defensive players through this audition! I know the coaches are also looking for another forward to compliment Namgyu but just strengthening the defense and making sure Namgyu &amp; Eungyu don't have to drop back to help will alleviate some pressure.",

IMO he shone the best as LWB during the Avengers' short time running the 3-5-2. Somewhere along the line he started missing the timing on his runs and got bumped to defense which just made his slump worse.\n\nIt's such a shame, I feel like the team really lost a lot of life on the wing without him. And I'd much rather see him get back in form than a new member taking that position (no hate against any future members of course!)",

I wonder why they don\u2019t do it more often especially since it would make sense with the amount of defenders they have.\n\nDepending on who\u2019s at the shoot Je-un, Andre, Taesool, and Woowoo are all good defenders 3 of them with the back up of the midfielders when on defense seems pretty solid to me.\n\nHopefully they get a couple good defenders bc even though they have some most of them are post injury, don\u2019t have the stamina to play a full game at their best, or can\u2019t be at a lot of the shoots due to scheduling conflicts.",

But I disagree with you, he's not that great at defense as he lacks tackling and marking, but positions himself well. That is the problem for the weak players of the team... they can't position themselves well and also have very weak touch as they can't control the ball well when receiving a pass or dribbling.\n\nTaesol is actually pretty good in his function. He does need to support the attack more though and also work on his overlapping/crossing. But overall I feel he is ok there.\n\nIt seems they recruited a GK from last episode. I wonder who will be sacked. Hyung-taik/Dong-hyun are good variety content.\n\nHere's my tier list of players!\n\n**Bad**\n\nPark Tae-Hwan  \nMo Tae Bom  \nLee Jang-Kun  \nHyung-taik  \nDong-hyun\n\n**Alright**\n\nYo-han  \nAndre  \nTaesol  \nJe-eun\n\n**Good**\n\nJun-hyeon  \nWon-woo\n\n**Very Good**\n\nLee Dae-hoon  \nHeo Min-ho  \nHyeon-woo\n\n**God-level**\n\nNam-kyu  \nEun-gyoo  \n**Chilku, the APPROACHABLE Son Heung-Min.

Nam-kyu was also great for start, but he got a lot more confident in kicking from long distance.\n\nThe thing is no one will shine if Mo Tae Bom is playing on right wing at the same time as Park Tae-Hwan! Everyone will have to cover for them.\n\nI forgot Ji-hwan and Jun-ho, who are both on Good category I guess, borderline Alright haha.",

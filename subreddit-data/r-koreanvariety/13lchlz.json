    "postText": "Hi guys. Just finished Time Hotel, and I loved it! Just wondering if you can suggest any show within this genre. I have watched Genius in the past. I also enjoyed Great Escape. Also enjoyed NJTW. I have watched a lot but I still want more. Maybe someone in this subreddit can point me to a great recommendation. Thanks!",

            "comment": "I reccomend:\n\n**Bloody Game 2** (currently airing) - PLUS, Hong Jin Ho is in it, if you're a fan of his\n\n**Girl's High School Mystery Class** (2 seasons) - similar to great escape, all female cast, more story/role playing driven. I thought I wouldnt like it so I put it off for a long time, but it is actually really good. Cast chemistry is top tier.\n\n**Crime Scene** (3 seasons) - episodic murder mysteries that get solved by the cast. If you had to try, i'd say start with Season 2. You wont miss anything from S1. Bonus: Hong Jin Ho is in it, as well as Park Ji Yoon (who is also in GHSMC).\n\nI also love this type of variety shows, so I'm making my way through suggestions as well. Tip: look for shows the PDs are a part of, such as Jung Jong Yeon (Genius, TGE, Society Game), or Na PD (NJTW, 1N2D). I haven't seen all of them so I can't suggest more, but maybe you'll find something you'd like to try.",

Basically they're put in an area (zone) where they have to survive under certain conditions/disasters. Mostly fun due to their reactions, like getting stuck in a haunted house and trying not to quit from freaking out, or getting chased by zombies.",

And I think the games have been good.  Everything's so much better with 6 members. KJM is a standout in this trip.  I'm looking forward to more Jung Jong battles in the future.",

I always love when the members cook for themselves, they're decent cooks so it's so wholesome seeing them cooking together. The break time segment to comfirm YSH as the weakest one is so much fun! I'm also relieved no one hurt during Stairway to Heaven game, that was dangerous with the slippery snow.\n\nWhy do I think Jongmin took the Hoon Min war more seriously than Jung hoon?\ud83e\udd2dI'm looking forward to more Hoon Min war after this~",

Then the come from behind victory in the one-legged fight to prove he's not to be meddled with!!&lt;",

It's close enough that I doubt it was intentional, but yeah, Jung-Hoon's team wuz robbed.\n\nThe boys were slipping a few times, so you're not alone about being concerned with safety.\n\nIn my view, the cooking together (Always a favorite of mine) was wholesome enough that I still enjoyed the episode.",

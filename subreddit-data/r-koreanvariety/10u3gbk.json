    "postText": "HaHa and his wife, Byul, play the computer game Super Bunny Man together. The goal is to get the carrot to the portal.\n\nNo subs, but you don't need them to understand what's going on.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_dF4136Vn0\n\nI don't watch his channel because it's not subbed, but the Youtube algorithm suggested it and I saw Byul in the thumbnail so I clicked. An unexpected gem. The parts between 8:00 and 12:00 were the hardest I've laughed in a long time.\n\nI hope someone else enjoys it as much as I did.",

EDIT: looks like it's available in [Viki](https://www.viki.com/tv/39419c-peak-time#episodes)\n\nThe only reason I might tune in for this is because apparently DGNA and JongUp (of BAP) participating XD I saw from [pannatic](https://twitter.com/pannatic/status/1626064801599459333) that DGNA caught quite amount of attentions becasue of their cover of Mirotic. Pannatic aslo said JongU [gain attention](https://twitter.com/pannatic/status/1626067386804899840) from his performance as well!\n\nI'm not sure how many of people here used to follow DGNA, but if want to try listen their songs, I would like to recommend these titles:  \n[Stumble Stumbe (\ube44\ud2c0\ube44\ud2c0)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=SCEbwKSYg7Y&amp;feature=share)   \n[No One...

I do wonder if they won't have some of the groups with 2-3 members combine later on to make larger groups since they keep mentioning \"filling the stage\".  And the prize for winning is really impressive. 300 million won (~230k US dollars) AND a concert? I hope the ratings are good lol. Lastly I'm definitely very bitter about BAP. So bitter.

Since I haven\u2019t been following much of the 3rd and 4th gen, I jumped straight into the show without recognizing any faces, but so pleasantly surprised when JongUp showed up!! \n\nIt was a bummer but BAP didn\u2019t join the show as a team, but I kinda understand as they have a lot on the line for them, and iKon really didn\u2019t do that well in Kingdom either. Well, I\u2019ll be rooting for JongUp for sure.\n\nHas some pleasant discoveries in this show, DBK with Harry-June (thanks Brave Ent for the blatant marketing, it was so clear that DBK had so much more screen time on reactions compared to other teams) as he dances so well, standing out in a group of many people. The duo who sang JYP\u2019s Fever is definitely a strong competitor (kinda reminds me of GD and Taeyang even though their colors are less unique). \n\nI really feel that the resources is probably really important, like the groups can be so great but if they cannot self-produce songs that fit with their concept or receive great songs, then it\u2019ll be really hard to stand out. GHOST9 and NTX seem good but I can\u2019t think of anything about them that stands out. Many gen 4 is focusing too much on dancing and performing, so they just need to have ok-ish vocals and maybe good enough-ish rappers?\n\nAnyways it\u2019s still very early to judge. I\u2019m really rooting for all teams as they are all very determined and hard-working people. I just hope that they will deliver good performances that are enjoyable in both listening and watching, and not falling into trap of preparing theatrical performances like Kingdom (I\u2019m still sour about it, I came in for good music and left with a really bad taste because all I could remember was people rolling and flying around and extravagant props and sets but the music was just \ud83d\ude11) \n\nLast but not least, can BAP have a comeback after this show pleaseeee \ud83d\ude4f",

    "postText": "2nd place winner Hae-min Jung gave an interview because he could not take the pain of his allegedly tampered loss.\n\nJung ( cycler officially 2nd place) \n\nWoo( crossfitter officially 1st place and winner of phyiscall 100)\n\nBasically what Jung claims to have happened in the finals\n\n1. Jung was almost substantially ahead in pulling the ropes (almost 3 times apparantly)\n\n2. Woo called to the PDs saying that his wheel and ropes had problems and that there was noise\n\n3. the PDs checked and found nothing wrong with Woo's wheel but Woo asked for a rematch anyway saying the delay from checking the wheel was too long.\n\n4. Even after this Jung was still at a great advantage in the second try of the pulling rope game. Then when he was sure of his win, the PDs told them to stop the match. There was an issue with the audio.\n\n5. the PDs suggested the match to be held a third time and that this time they would cut the rope as much as the contestants pulled it, to be fair to Jung. \n\n6. Jung still protested that he was winning two times already and he is exhausted and can't take a third match. the PDs were not having it and Jung gave in to the pressure of all the PDs staffs and other contestants waiting on him to just go with it.\n\n7. the third match of the pulling rope and Jung said it looked like they didn't cut the rope to match the second match at all.\n\n8. Maybe because he poured everything in the first two matches or maybe there was a problem with wheel but Jung said on the third match his rope didn't move an inch.\n\n9. Jung said he admits a loss is a loss no matter what the circumstances were. \n\n10. He says it's not all about the money... he just feels cheated that they cut all of this out of the show and made it look like he just lost fair and square in one match to Woo.\n\n\nIf this turns out to be half true the fault lies heavily on the PDs... but it's not a good look on Woo either LOL",

Crossfit is basically doing complex olympic lifting movements combined with cardio, so unless you know what you're doing, it's dangerous and you can easily hurt yourself\n\nit's better to start small and learn the basics first, there are a lot of good and free resources on places like /r/Fitness",

The complicated movements involved in the exercises aren't suited for people without prior lifting experience.\n\n\nif the exercises are \"scaled down\" then it's better to join a regular gym or do bodyweight exercises for wayyyyy cheaper. for others who are inspired by this show: start small. /r/Fitness has good and free resources on starting the journey to a healthier lifestyle!\n\nmy point was that Crossfit can be a good challenge for someone who already has the fundamentals of lifting, but it's not a good choice for beginners",

            "comment": "Some people have mentioned how the games in Time Hotel were sometimes disadvantageous to his skills (mainly the math/calculation-heavy games, outside of those he tended to do very well), but I think there are three other factors.\n\n1. Jinho had a bit of an advantage at the start where he was able to get the ball rolling on a solid alliance before being in big danger of elimination. Despite how good Jinho's social game is, there is a decent chance that he'd get targeted hard if he was with the regular players from the start of the game and be in a much tougher spot. But since he was able to build some momentum, he's been really good at keeping his whole operation running smoothly. In comparison, he and his allies had to work a lot in Time Hotel to stay on top of the ball to avoid elimination (when there sometimes wasn't even a DM).\n2. In Time Hotel, Jinho was having to play with one guy who was literally obsessed with taking him out regardless of whether it'd help him win the show. Luckily it seems like he doesn't have to deal with anyone that wacky in this show.\n3. He finished playing Time Hotel almost right before he went into Bloody Game, so I have to imagine he was pretty warmed up from having to play so many games on Time Hotel that he kind of hit the ground running once he started in Bloody Game.",

Essentially he got his CORE people with the way stuff are against them at beginning, those 3(4 with jimin) built very strong core plus xitsuh actually ALL IN in the team are just blessings tbh - Jimin on the spot decision kinda been biggest boon to his core party.\n\nAt beginning, Dex n jimin only wanted to 'used' jinho to certain point in the game then betrayed him BUT now with their experience facing difficulty together, it's very very hard for them to go against each other.",

So many team games early also help maintain his position higher among the participants.",

            "comment": "IMO, It's the type of games played. HJH is strong with specific types of games, because he is mentally strong, reads people well, making him many steps ahead of his opponents. However, he is bad with math and arithmetic type of games. There were so many of those types in Time Hotel, especially the finals.\n\n Another asset of his is that his personality is very likeable (to cast and audience). He has his quirks and flaws, and he owns up to them (like his poor diction, always being 2nd place, etc). In all the shows he's been in, he has never betrayed anyone or instigated political plays or been mean to anyone. He likes to play fair. He usually chooses to save people, even if it means he gives up benefits of being the winner. He generally makes it very far with good team until late game, then he excels on his own in the final individual battles.",

I don't remember what happened exactly in that episode you reference, so maybe our interpretations would differ (or not), but i think we can both agree that broadly speaking he isn't the kind of player who seeks out advantages through controlling the situation in a way where someone spies or betrays for other gain.  \nThat makes him rather endearing.",

And, is guarded in his words and goofy image.. so one doesn't feel bad about it\n\nHe collaborated with this guy in ep1, and the other guy ended up being last. Instead of supporting him in death match (rock , paper, scissor) he betrayed him because he needed to show others that he wants to work with them. Had anyone else done it, they would have got criticised.\n\nJinho is very astute and the way he presents his reason for doing something works in his favour because his reasons are also how a skilled, confident person will think instead of free riders",

He pissed his pants on the make an equation that equals 100 in Bloody Game 2 but his piss didn't smell as bad as the shit from the other team. His lack in politics was covered due to a strong alliance formed from the beginning. In Time Hotel, his 3 man alliance had its shaky moments due to other uncertain recruits, and he almost was eliminated on a numbers game deathmatch.",

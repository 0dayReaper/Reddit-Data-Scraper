Specially as you said, I also think Mijoo does not seem very enthusiastic.\n\nI am still confused on this whole song thing. Did YJS really want this opportunity (as the last ep made it seems like it was his idea) or the PD really 'forced' him by doing the questioning live. It is just too 'convenient' that the song fits JooJoo sister's voice to begin with.",

When musicians have time to practice, their takes come out very similar which is why it's actually hard to get them to adapt. Go back to any of the previous group projects where the first few takes were near similar.\n\nMeanwhile with Mijoo and Jinjoo you can hear how every take is different, and they're gaining confidence mid verse.",

Assuming they are 100% serious with how secretive they were practicing the dance and Jae Seok pretty much has free reign on what he does over at Antenna, then the PD has very few options on who he could have gotten this information from.\n\nIt's not that hard to believe that Jae Seok pitched the idea himself to the production team behind the scenes and then came up with a concept to pitch it on camera. To be able to genuinely pressure Yu Jae Seok into doing anything he doesn't want to do would make Chang Hoon one of the most powerful people in the entertainment industry (Which let's face it, he's not).\n\nAlso why does this feel like a discussion on episode 176 (Based on both Viki and Kocowa streaming services) since episode 175 is the second half the detective episode.",

I really don't understand the appeal of this elevator muzak. It was nice to hear Mijoo and Jinjoo sing again even if I dislike the song.\n\nI wish people on here would give the manufactured outrage a rest or move on to a different show if you don't like this one. Stop with the hate watching and the hate commenting. YJS is the most powerful guy in SK Entertainment. He does what he want on these shows and nobody PDs don't push him around. The whole concept they've been doing is the PD annoying YJS which they played up again last week. They pretend like it was an unplanned meeting but you don't gather a dozen staff and equipment and wait for the off-chance you can ambush YJS when he finished filming another show. It's all a show, just like him getting bullied by KJK on Running Man is not real but an act. However, there are people pre-disposed to look for any reason to attack the PD and found another fake outrage moment to blame the PD for 'bullying' YJS into giving up a song. It's obvious this was a setup to give a song to the JooJoos, and was just another entertaining moment of YJS being 'bullied' on TV like what happens on Running Man, and Busted, and Sixth Sense, and The Zone, and &lt;insert every other show he's on&gt;.",

Instead, they erased scenes from the actual broadcast upload last week and tried to manipulate the public this week by cutting and pasting scenes out of order. Beyond all that, YJS has never looked as uncomfortable as he did while the PD was pestering him to reveal the song. People aren\u2019t stupid.

Most of what he tries fails more than it works, but his \"ambushes\" with early morning filming or day-off but not really day-off have been the best new stuff he's tried. It gets the cast out of the rut they were falling into and generates an us-vs-them camaraderie.

If it was truly planned that means they thought this was a good idea, which is a bit of a head scratcher. \n\nIf they wanted to keep up the PDs ambush character (?) then they could\u2019ve just had him show up and say \u201cYJS we want to do a new project, do you have any ideas\u201d and then YJS can pitch the dance cover and song and there you go, no problems. Idk why they\u2019d want to overcomplicate it by making this a skit where they appear to meddle in YJS personal stuff.",

But I guess the way it started will always kinda taint it. If anyone else saw the edited preview from last week, I have no idea why they didn\u2019t edit it like that from the start if they were going to do it this way. I guess there might be some kind of mention of the response by YJS next week.",

    "postText": "# Description\n\n&gt; Love Catcher is a show featuring a group of men and women coming together for love or money. In this event, men and women who do not know each other will live in the same house. But before moving into the house, participants must choose between two identities: 'Love Catcher' or 'Money Catcher'. Later, 'Money Catcher' was seen forming sincere relationships with other 'Love Catchers'. On the other hand, 'Money Catcher' can win almost $50,000 if they can become a couple with 'Love Catcher' at the end of the show. When making romantic advances, there's an added mood of caution as participants can only guess who's there for love or money. \n\n# Panel\n\n* Jang Do Yeon\n* Joo Woo Jae\n* Jun Hyun Moo\n* Gabee\n* Kim Yo Han\n\n# Cast\n\nMale Participants\n* Park Yong Ho - [@hoho_dragon](https://www.instagram.com/hoho_dragon/)\n* Cho Seong Beom - [@laul_sb](https://www.instagram.com/laul_sb/)\n* Park Jung Hyun - [@junghyuniiii](https://www.instagram.com/junghyuniiii/)\n* Kim Yoon Soo Ro - [@kimyunsuro](https://www.instagram.com/kimyunsuro/)\n* Kwak Tae Hyeok - [@kwak_taehyeok](https://www.instagram.com/kwak_taehyeok/)\n\nFemale Participants\n* Kim Hyo Jin - [@h3_1o](https://www.instagram.com/h3_1o/)\n* Hwang Soo Ji - [@t_110771](https://www.instagram.com/t_110771/)\n* Lee Yu Jeong - [@ririyujeong](https://www.instagram.com/ririyujeong/)\n* Choi Tae Eun - [@c.taeeun](https://www.instagram.com/c.taeeun/)\n* Hong Seung Yeon - [@applemang0o](https://www.instagram.com/applemang0o/)\n\n\n# Episode Links\n\n|Info|Link|Notes|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|RAW|[Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1514y1N7Sj/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click)||\n|Stream|[VIU](https://www.viu.com/ott/sg/en-us/vod/466920/Love-Catcher-in-Bali)|^(ENG SUB)|\n|Softsub|[Download](https://link.emediaarts.net/lovecatcherinbali/lcib-episode-4)|^(ENG SUB)|\n\n# Previous Discussions\n\n|Episode(s)|\n|:-:|\n|[01](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yyjiu2/love_catcher_in_bali_e01_221118/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [02](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z487z3/love_catcher_in_bali_e02_221125/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [03](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zafwqf/love_catcher_in_bali_e03_221202/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)|\n\n___\nTHE DISCUSSION BELOW MAY CONTAIN ***SPOILERS***",

I don't have high hopes that they are going to be love-love and will pick each other so yeah, just rooting for them to win if they are.\n\nFor the preview:  I am so looking forward to Seungyeon \"breaking absolutes\" but I want Taeeun-Sooro to stay strong. Everyone is so likeable except Seongbeom (LOL) that's why I am like this, I just want her to try her chance and be completely over him later on.\n\nTae-eun &amp; Sooro should be a **love-love couple**. (*They're my favorite couple already and I like there's no ambiguity in them from this episode.)* **Money-love** is possible too as long as they have a solid ground that nothing changes but that the latter can break one's trust so I prefer the first option.",

I'm hoping the next episodes mix these up a bit, in the previews we can see Seung Yeon having a date with Soo Ro.\n\nIt's alarming to watch Yong Ho throw himself at Soo Ji. He's allergic to sunlight, yet throws his own towel on her. He cannot swim, yet takes off his life jacket so he can join Soo Ji diving in the water. I think Soo Ji is used to guys doing things like this for her and she takes full advantage of it.\n\nHaving an odd number of contestants in each group was cruel to both the contestants and to the viewers. It's not fun watching Seung Yeon almost in tears paddling alone in a canoe. At least maybe give her an opportunity to do an activity with the other exiled contestant.",

Such a girlfriend is great for show off and if you like High society feel.. but she isn't the one going to stand by you to support you or push you forward or compromise to balance things out..\n\n1. Based on text, seems people know that Y is not very fond of sunlight. He said it out loud he wants B.. SJ could have gone with it, but very authoritatvely said \"But, I want A\" .. and then not bother. choice was Y's to switch or not\n\n2. When she said in interview, she is not into either.. and her interest dependes on \"who can do more grand actions for me\".. dude, that's a narcissist proud woman talking.. in real life, i can totally see a straight studious nerd kind guy falling for high school prom queen suji despite her shallowness storyline here\n\n3. there are a lot of comments she made this episode.. so self centered",

She should obviously use every opportunity to get as much out of this experience as possible. Yong Ho is also a grown ass person. We shouldn't act like he was forced into making a decision. \n\n2. I like Yong Ho. I really do. But frankly, if the guy I liked disappeared at every sign of confrontation (not even that. Sung Bum appears in the room and YH is already in a different room), I would definitely second guess my feelings for him. \n\n3. SJ seems like a money catcher with zero sensitivity. Everyone and their parent can see that Sung Bum is Mr. Red flag. She however keeps him, to take time in figuring out which of the guys is MC.",

She is grown up woman not a toddler..and  if she is materialistic, then she is.. there is no need to get defensive about that or trying to justify her behavior..\n\nShe had 20 yrs to learn how to behave and what she prioritizes or not.. so putting up an act of naive innocent and pure is hogwash\n\n2. you are entitled to your opinion. as far as SJ is concerned, i don't think she cares tbh.. she just doesn't care... she is here to flirt, have fun, be pampered and be center of attraction.. i am more interested in knowing what happens if none of the guy pays her any attention\n\n3. SJ is not MC.. she just enjoys attention.. i don't think she keeps SB because she is \"figuring\" him out.. She just likes to be the female lea of a triangle.. that too involving 2 out of the 3 hottest guy in the house (hottest- by how women reacted on first day)",

Yes, the pattern seems to be 3:00AM EST as it's like 12:00AM PST (Los Angeles Time). \n\nMake sure to convert it to your time zone as sometimes this schedule will change (by 1/2 or so hours) when the seasons are different.\n\nSo in about 3 hours, there should be English subs for Love Catcher in Bali.",

But ya idk, she's also kinda suspicious. She legit seems laidback/etc. though, so who knows.\n\nWith Hyojin, I accidentally spoiled/etc. myself again in the Youtube comments and so on for these dating shows, lol. Don't use auto-translate, especially with Chinese (dating) shows as entire shows are sometimes spoiled in the Youtube comments. For Korean shows it's less so but it can sometimes have the leaks/spoilers/etc. too. \n\nBut apparently ya, Hyojin only broke up with her ex for a few months before being in the show. And like now they have pictures together again or something like that. Not sure, it's on Instagram or something.\n\nApparently Seungyeon/Taeeun/etc. were posting spoilers or subtle clues and such on social media, lol.\n\nSo some people here on reddit and elsewhere are saying Hyojin is acting too innocent/pure/etc. right, but a possible big indication of money/love catcher is like if they are fresh out of a breakup or not. \n\nBecause usually breakups have lingering feelings and such, so it's probably likely Hyojin chose money catcher. Especially since she only saw Yongho and Seongbeom and they were maybe not to her immediate liking. If she saw Jeonghyeon during the first meeting, it might be different.\n\nI really do hope that Hyojin is a love catcher too, either with Yongho or Jeonghyeon.\n\nAbout a month or so ago, or before Love Catcher in Bali aired, they released the photos/trailers/etc. And like her photoshoot scene with Jeonghyeon during those previews legit had me saying, wait that's straight out of a Kdrama or idol scene, lol. But ya I usually ship the first couple that enter the house though, so that's why Yongho is there too.",

And if YH wanted to sent HJ a signal he wouldn't deny it so adamantly. \n\nCouldnt HJ be a money? Now that she thinks YH is love, she's shifting her target? \n\nLooks like SJ was influenced by the other women saying SB was 100% a MC. She has her guard up now. \n\nOmggggg when SR came down the stairs and saw TE talking to SB he automatically came and sat RIGHT beside her. So cute! \n\nWhen SB left to get his phone they looked like they wanted to kiss \ud83d\ude0d\n\nSooooo JH does like HJ even tho he rejected her help in the kitchen. Interesting. HJ is unintentionally taking credit for YJ's msg to JH! \n\nYH totally ignoring HJ and heading straight to SJ on the yacht is totally something I would have done. If i have something in mind I can't do other things while I wait for my chance to complete that task. \n\nHJ asking SY to swap courses was smart. I wonder why SY hesitated? I thought she'd want to be with SR. \n\nThat was so savage to make them snorkel in pairs w one person left out. \n\n\"I must be alive to be in love.\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nBut also lmao at SJ trying to dive w a lifejacket on. Gurl do you know what those are for? \n\nUmmmmmm YH not knowing how to swim and taking his life jacket off was kind of a crazy decision. The water did look pretty calm though. And fins make swimming/floating a lot easier. But like he could have just waited for her while she dived without taking his lifejacket off.\n\nOh no SY sitting in her kayak alone and not even paddling was so sad.\n\nDef shipping SR x TE and SJ x YH! Not sure how i feel abt the TH &gt; YJ &gt; JH &gt; HJ love square. I guess TH x YJ and JH x HJ would mean having 2 more couples but i can't really see it happening yet. I kinda like YJ x JH too.\n\nLmao \"if you don't text me i'll kill you\"\n\nTH thinking the text he got was from the PDs \ud83d\ude02\n\nI feel for SY bc I feel like if I ever did a kdating show I'd def be the one not getting any texts \ud83e\udd72. I applaud her persistence tho lol. She's def not a MC. \n\nWhen they showed YJ and SY in their room after the secret room announcement, HJ wasn't there in the wide shot. So it's probably her. \n\nAhhh HJ or SJ is a money catcher! \n\nIt seems like maybe only MCs get to host the secret night? \n\nI feel like they overcorrected from last season and tried to cast way more LCs this season. So that means there's a good chance TE x SR and SJ x YH couples could all be LCs. \n\nOther than SB i don't have a good sense who the other MCs are. It would be cray if SR and SJ were the 2 other MCs. But I suspect HJ more than SJ at this point.\n\nLooks like SY gets a chance to sway SR next week! Next ep looks lit!",

She probably thought Junghyun had no interest in her even after doing a photoshoot together, so she wanted to have another option other than him.\nI don't know why the editing focused on the folded page, maybe to give a hint that she is money catcher. But as I observe, it usually happens the other way around. Someone suspected as money catcher turns out to be love catcher.\n\nIt's good that Yongho gave indirect clarity to Hyojin that he isn't interested in her. She could have more interaction with Junghyun as he starts to lean on her.\nI just want everyone to be coupled up, including Seungyeon.",

It\u2019s already episode 4 and we are not getting any 1-1 date? even the photoshoot was a 3some. then it was boys and girls hanging out SEPARATELY which i find redundant. then this group activity that was poorly planned. instead of having some secret night where they\u2019re chatting anonymously why not let them choose who they want to go on a date with? plus it\u2019s pretty obvious who is the MC this season as they\u2019re acting to aggressive and changing their interest so fast when they see the other party is not interested. they\u2019re easily switching targets bcos they wna move fast and make sure they make a connection fast because duh they wna win. i don\u2019t like this",

We haven't had any clue about it beyond the knowledge that the third MC does exist.!&lt;",

EVERYONE PROTECT IZ*ONE JANG WONYOUNG/KIM MINJU/ETC.\n\nHyojin kinda looks really different during that night balcony scene eh, like the lack of lightning, her hairstyle.\n\nStill, Love Catcher in Bali visuals are unmatched so far with these other new dating shows.\n\nSmh fam, I wanted more Yongho x Hyojin scenes instead of Taeeun x Yoonsuro (x Seungyeon) scenes. Like that night balcony or upper floor scene had me hoping. HOPE. COPE.\n\nBut ya Jeonghyeon x Hyojin is probably the ultimate ship anyway since the previews or teasers/trailers/etc. Sorta funny how Jeonghyeon didn't realize Hyojin sent her text to Yongho. Like when Jeonghyeon and Hyojin were downstairs talking about their messages, lol.\n\n---\n\nAnd yo when Yongho was like discussing the combos for the SUV seating arrangement or groups, I was like real shit fam? Why do that to Hyojin. She is like 67% money catcher, but wtf Yongho, give her a chance. Come on buddy.\n\nCome to think of it, wonder how the seating allotment was determined. Did the housemates choose or did producers nudge some of them, because roommates duos were in one whole van.\n\nIt's crazy how many things in common Hyojin and Yongho have. Wtf, living (studying) in Achasan/Gunja area. \ud64d\ubcf4\ub300\uc0ac, or ambassador for their schools. Fam, this is literally match made in heaven, too bad Hyojin is probably not that into fast-paced love.\n\nOh ya, btw, what are those circular patches on the area just below the males' right ear or so? Like for something? Not nicotine/etc. patches right? Bug repellent? Cybernetic implants, lol?\n\nAnd then when they were in the yacht, the bow, Hyojin asked Yongho to sit beside her. THIS FOOL. FML. LMAO. She even took one of those inflatable cushion things. FAM, WHAT IN THE. Deck. That's how you know, the money catcher assertive trope.\n\nBut who cares bro, she was saying something about the serious conversation in the SUV/car: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um_nApDOEX4&amp;t=280s. They know the clips that people want, rofl, check the TVING Youtube channel, or type \"\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac\" for the videos/clips to show up.\n\nPDNIMs, WHY DO YOU WITHHELD THE CONVO THAT THEY HAD IN THE CAR. HELLO? Can't believe this is possibly the only Hyojin x Yongho timeline, only in Episode 4. SMH.\n\nThough Yongho was too busy looking at Suji (and Seongbeom). Seriously. What the...\n\nAnd then he just randomly/purposely gets up and sits beside Suji in front of Hyojin. MDR, TABARNAK.\n\n---\n\nOmg fam, it's true, if Seongbeom didn't pressure Suji the night before, she might've messaged Seongbeom and then Yongho wouldn't have felt reassured and so then we could've had a Yongho x Hyojin timeline especially during this boating trip or excursion. Come on, bruh.\n\nLike it would've been Hyojin and Yongho canoeing. Yongho for sure knows how to canoe right? He was here in the Americas, but ya some people still do not have that opportunity and he's scared of water.\n\nReminds me, I actually don't have that opportunity too since you need to go hours up north to get that like peaceful canoeing/kayaking time. With the standing lakes and mosquito-ridden cottages. \n\nBut anyway, I was there during a family gathering and fam, when the sun is bearing down on you, everything is so hot and so like the plastic/etc. and everything is just not it. Anyway, I was just there to relive the kayaking I did with my cousins several years ago too.\n\nDefinitely not for anybody with a sun allergy or something, need like SPF 50 or so sunscreen for sure, but ya Yongho would've been fine since they would've been underneath the mangrove trees. The alternate timelines, my God.\n\nYongho legit really sat beside Suji for the whole time Seongbeom was pissing or something, rofl wtf.\n\nBtw, it's so overdone but the writers/editors legit keep giving us sad emotion vibes whenever Seongbeom appears and Yongho is just there looking resigned or something, lmao. Like it's funny af BUT I JUST WANT THAT YONGHO X HYOJIN TIMELINE, lol.\n\n---\n\nThen the Course A or Course B trivia happened. Wait, they never showed banana boat riding eh. Is Hyojin's tattoo a banana, the one near her left elbow, lol. Anyway everyone was announcing their thoughts out loud, lmao. \n\nWait nevermind, the banana boat was their ride to the snorkeling area, rofl. I thought it was when they're tied to a fast boat and like they get the bumpy waves, lol.\n\nHyojin was legit begging Seungyeon to switch eh, Hyojin's eyes were so filled with intent, sheesh. YONGHO, YOU MESSED IT UP. SIGH. Was that like her last chance given to Yongho or something. Hi, what alternate timelines, dimensions, are there. The way I want it more. Alexa, play tripleS/Acid Angel from Asia's Dimension, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkQq0VWsMek\n\nReversion, when they were taking photos of each other during the banana boat ride, WAS THAT REALLY YONGHO CROPPING OUT HYOJIN IN FAVOR OF SUJI. My mind cannot compute such travesty, wtf?\n\nFor the snorkeling date, what if she didn't choose Jeonghyeon. What if she didn't mind Yongho's tunnel vision with Suji. What if Hyojin's a money catcher and disregarded Yongho's sad actions. So many what ifs when they were on that platform. Holy.\n\n---\n\nThey got life vests for snorkeling, lol. It's not that deep though. That's wild. It's kinda weird that some of them wouldn't know how to swim since Bali is kinda known for coastal activities but that's how it is sometimes.\n\nYongho and Jeonghyeon legit taking the arms of the girls though, wtf the bold moves.\n\nBut Yongho really risked his life so that Suji could swim without the life vest? Wtf. Suji doesn't even swim properly or dive below. Though Yongho still did it, wow. They even had to put a disclaimer about safety, lol.\n\nAlmost for sure that Yongho probably felt like he was in heaven when he got those face taps from Suji, damn.\n\nTaehyeok puking over the yacht had me reminiscing. It's been like a decade or so since I've been in a legit boat in the sea, ocean, Pacific. Oh how I miss the tropical image of my youth. Insular. In solar. The marine life.\n\nBut ya, they did Seungyeon dirty there, idk wtf the producers/etc. were thinking for that canoe date setup. Sigh.\n\nOh nice, that Yongho x Suji scene with the sunset was in the previews. It kinda spoiled the plot earlier, lol. I thought it was gonna be like some other Korean/Chinese/etc. dating shows where they get a small yacht/boat for themselves but no. It was actually a group yacht or activity, lmao.\n\nI just can't believe this timeline again. Fam, dunno why I keep shipping the first couple that meet in the houses of these dating shows. Because usually they are the OTP or ship though. But ya, it's insane how this Episode 4 is probably the only episode with that many Hyojin x Yongho interactions. Not like this.\n\nUnless they're going like Seongbeom --&gt; Suji --&gt; Yongho for the secret night date situation where the previous invited person is the new invitee, then ya it's Hyojin, almost 100%.\n\nMy God, this whole post is really about the Hyojin x Yongho OTP eh. Reminds me of FanFiction.net/etc. days, lmao.\n\nAU, [Hyojin K., Yongho P.]",

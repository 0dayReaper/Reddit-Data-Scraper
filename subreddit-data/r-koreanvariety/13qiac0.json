It\u2019s a repackaging of an old show with the original hosts, same format but slightly more modern twist (teams) thumbnail is okay a little cringey, but not bad. Only critique is probably improving the chairs for the guests. Watching KB so many people have said sitting on the chair for hours on end just to say your story must  and react to everyone else\u2019s must be real draining.",

I was feeling so uncomfortable I just stop watching and still not planning to finish it off. \n\nI wish we got less panelists because they are so chaotic and distracting. We have lots of guests with stories, I want more screentime for them.",

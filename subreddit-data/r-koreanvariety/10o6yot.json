    "postText": "**Description**\n\n&gt;The cast and guests play games to win and enjoy different foods from a featured outdoor market in Korea. The main game consists of listening to a song and determining the correct lyrics for a part of it while employing different hints to get closer to the solution. Every failed attempt means more food for YouTube mukbang star Small-mouthed Haetnim. During Snack Time a different game each week determines who gets to try a snack representing this week's market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Host**\n\n* Boom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Shin Dong-yeop\n* Kim Dong-hyun\n* Moon Se-yoon\n* Park Narae\n* Hanhae\n* Key\n* Nucksal\n* Taeyeon\n* Haetnim\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Guests**\n\n* Lee Hanee\n* Park So Dam\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**One Shots**\n\n|Member|2023|Overall|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Key|0|94|\n|Seyoon|0 + 1|76 + 1|\n|Hanhae|1 + 1|57 + 1|\n|P.O\\*|0|56|\n|Hyeri\\*|0|49|\n|Nucksal|0 + 1|46 +1|\n|Narae|0|38|\n|Taeyeon|0|20|\n|Shin Dongyeob|1|16|\n|Donghyun|0|15|\n|Haetnim|0|1|\n\n\\*\\*updated based on Wiki'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Subtitles**\n\n|**Stream**|Link|\n|:-|:-|\n|Streaming site|[Viu](https://www.viu.com/ott/ph/en-us/vod/2063970/Amazing-Saturday-2023)|\n\n**Source**\n\n\\*Viu\n\n^(\\*you can still support @/dareumi from all the subtitle works they had done for the community by donating through -)  [^(ko-fi.com/dareumi)](https://ko-fi.com/dareumi) \\+",

Also, the 'energy' part was so hilarious, it took me out when the members also burst out laughing. The 2nd song was hard indeed, it made me focus along with the members that I still hear it ringing in my ears lmao even Haetnim got addicted.",

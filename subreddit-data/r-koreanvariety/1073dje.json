Girls High School Mystery Class 2, Earth Arcade, Transit Love and recently Treasure Hunt are the ones that come to my mind. Kick a Goal also if you are interested in sports. All other programs just feel repetitive and more or less the same to me. Like there're 10 million love variety shows and travel reality shows with actors over the last couple of years",

Yes alot of programs are copycats of present trends (hello dating shows!), tried and tested ones (observational shows like my ugly duckling), and recapturing old magic (actors going abroad screams grandpas over flowers, hdyp). However other shows may seem trendy/repetitive but im glad it happened like sport shows are plenty more now than 5 years ago (golf, ssireum, basketball, etc). There are still other unique shows like the programs you mentioned or simple ones like Problem Child in House.\n\nUltimately its on the people behind those programs, the staffs. Earth Arcade is just NJTTW female version but is applauded for great casting and still has great editing. On the other hand, Transit Love is another dating show with a twist. But great casting and editing elevated it above the other dating shows.",

Shows these days are so repetitive, predictable, and risk-averse it feels almost deja-vu seeing the same things constantly\n\nYouTube channels are the new king and I\u2019m not even keen to keep my ODK subscription anymore (I only have it because my mom still uses it)",

The PDs and broadcasting companies have become so LAZY for some reason in recent years. It saddens me as a Korean varieties fan. They were brilliant because they were creative and fearless in the past. It's wild to think Infinite Challenge came up with new concepts every week back then, and the PDs these days brought up ideas every two years",

The first 2 eps were OK but it only gets better from there. I really enjoyed the cast individually too. Out of all the shows I've watched singles had me really thinking of what ifs ,relating it to a lot my dating patterns and reflecting. I'm still not over the show and that's not usual with dating shows specially.",

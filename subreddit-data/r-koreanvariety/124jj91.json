    "postText": "These past 2 episodes have been funnier. Also I think it shows that the show is much more hilarious when the \u201csons\u201d are in their little groups and interact with each other. \n\nAlso Min kyoung is such a breath of fresh air to the group. I can\u2019t wait for the Shooting Stars crossover!",

            "comment": "I'm just hoping their gag styles getting better after this, all the GZ, begger, debt jokes are becoming too overused. N it's not even lee sang min fault - the other members being shown on screen to not respecting him example Singapore Holiday episode. 3 dude ganging up on 1 person aren't fun to watch.\n\nIt's same thing happened to LSM on knowing bro, he speaks one word other people going to resort to mention GZ, begger, debt jokes... Like why when in reality it's just like making fun of the audience because LSM living conditions are way better than some of the audience. Now that he's pay his debt I'm hoping PD, cast wouldn't push those jokes to him anymore.\n\nI'm talking mainly about LSM because it's clear that MUD main guys are LSM, TJH, JH, WH - thd Dolsing 4 men crew, and like it or not they'll dominate the screen time",

There's a disgusting focus on materialism, in RM Sukjin brag about his name brand items, dramas scenes of picking on poor people.\n\nI too get that it's entertainment, but it's getting boring. I mostly can forgive dramas for using term beggars to insult people as it shows those people as villainistic, but calling people as beggars in variety, even as teasing is really fucked up.",

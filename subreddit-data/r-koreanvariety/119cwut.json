            "comment": "* What a great game. Really speaks to the talent in the show at this point. It was also a great match for the audience to watch. Exciting, quality play and high scoring. \n* Natty, Yoonju and Ga Young really wowed in this match. \n* Kyung Hee, with her hat trick, obviously played really well too. Did anyone else notice her fall a TON this match? I genuinely wonder if she had different spikes or something cause whether it was a shot, pass or changing directions she was falling on her butt all game. \n* This match really made clear to me that Taejin, at least for now, doesn't finish well as a striker. She was playing really well as a #2 offensive player who feeds the ball to the #1, in this case Ga Young, but when she tried to make something happen herself she did a mediocre job. What she needs is way more development and yet the show suspended her team...\n* Damn, the new player on NatFam being fast AF is gonna be fun. Obviously that doesn't translate to game speed, especially in sports where you dribble the ball with your feet, but it should still be fun to watch. \n* I'm still really bummed Seogi, arguably one of the most fun players to watch and one of the best on the show, was hurt. This match was the perfect opportunity for her to put on a show and have a blast. Sad. \n* I have mixed feelings on FC Streaming Fighter. Of course you can take the view point of their pilot season level play is a great opportunity to watch them develop. But you can also say that really worked back when all the teams were new, during the pilot season. They were all bad and making those brand-new-to-soccer mistakes. Now, in season 3, we've got teams playing solid if not quite well and in comes a team playing like this? Guaranteed to not win a match and just get suspended. Which is BAD because the last thing an inexperienced and underdeveloped team needs is to be suspended and therefore not getting the training and game reps they need to develop. Adding teams like BalladDream who fit in with the rest of the teams but aren't OP is how you maintain the skill level of every team in the league. We'll see how this goes. Maybe they develop fast or maybe the scenes previewed were not indicative of their play? But if it is, I'll be more upset Anaconda got demoted and replaced by a team who are going to get smoked by every team they play.",

All of the other teams are already passed the intro level and playing a decent game with a stable (yet noob) skills. All of these team already passed \"zombie\" mode, even when FC Ballad was introduced last season they were not playing zombie soccer. But this new team doesn't look like that they have the basic grasp of soccer and yet they will be playing against other seasoned  teams? Especially with FC Ballad and FC Wonder in their divisions? Look like a lamb sent to a slaughter. The show already wasted the growth of Anaconda, and they have 2 seasons of experience under them. This new team. FC Streaming? Are they set to fail?

Dayoung is still developing and now a new player to develop. I love MinJi 2NE1 because she is a tough idol based on her previous appearance on variety show, but this is a whole new beast. (PS: love 2NE1 songs). Looks like they might not be able to keep the title this coming season. They lost a skilled positioning player that can open up the defense, plus her experience of playing with the team is so valueable. Argh!!!! My favorite team!\n\nFC Gukdae might add on new players, but based on the what is shown so far, they can't be that threatening since losing a good GK and a stable striker. All that is left is SoYeon who will have to take care of the whole team. The rest are still weak and developing their basic skills. Sorry Gukdae not this coming season too. Just hoping they don't get knocked out of the league.",

Back issue for MiYeon is an ongoing one and will continue to be an issue, but her experience of playing the TG style is very important. TG strives on team play that were calm, confident and stable, it's a mental thing. Hoping that Dayoung and Minzy can play with these same mentality. We know RiNa and Yubin not going to let these two young players down and will lead them. Coach ByungJi always need to stick with their \"system\" as he put in the episode.

    "postText": "# Season 2 of Eden : Descendants of Instinct\n\n[From Viki Synopsis] \n\nPassions spilled over and couples were formed in the beachside EDEN house in season one: \u201cEDEN, Descendants of Instinct.\u201d But now the heat will be turned up yet another notch as a new set of male and female singletons heads to the EDEN house \u2013 in search of love. In EDEN, social norms and customs are done away with: Contestants speak to each other informally and without the honorifics usually used in everyday Korean language. The amount of information they are able to learn about one another is also limited, meaning that hierarchies cannot form easily here!\n\nWhile the first season saw the constants having fun in the sun, the second season promises a new range of pulse-racing games and activities \u2013 with a darker and sexier vibe than the first season. Three celebrity guides \u2013 [Lee Hong Ki](https://www.instagram.com/skullhong12/), [Yoon Bomi](http://instagram.com/__yoonbomi__), and [Simeez](https://www.instagram.com/_simeez/) \u2013 are on hand to watch events unfurl at the EDEN house and provide their commentary. With the romantic vibe turned all the way up to 10, will our hosts be able to contain their excitement...as the contestants\u2019 hunt for love intensifies?\n\n# Panel\n\n- Lee Hong Gi (FT Island) [skullhong12](https://www.instagram.com/skullhong12/)\n- Yoon Bomi (A-Pink) [\\_\\_yoonbomi\\_\\_](http://instagram.com/__yoonbomi__)\n- Simeez (SWF) [_simeez](https://www.instagram.com/_simeez/)\n- Seon Ji Hyun (Eden S1) [ooooog0](https://www.instagram.com/ooooog0) - Guest panel in Ep. 3.\n- Kim Chul Min (Eden S1) [maisonchul](https://www.instagram.com/maisonchul/) - Guest panel in Ep. 4.\n\n# Cast\n\n## Men\n\n- Jo Egeon [j0ysky](https://www.instagram.com/j0ysky/) - 31 y.o., Acting tutor/instructor\n- Kim Dohyun [1031daily](https://www.instagram.com/1031daily/) - 34 y.o., Make-up artist, Race car driver (hobby)\n- Kim Soomin [ssuuuuumin_](https://www.instagram.com/ssuuuuumin_/) - 34 y.o., Restaurant CEO, Poli-Sci Sungkyunkwan University (class of 2015)\n- Kim Kangrae [kang\\_rae\\_kim](https://www.instagram.com/kang_rae_kim/) - 25 y.o.

            "comment": "I haven\u2019t seen many people talk about it over here, but Egeon wrote a very long post on Xiaohongshu (i think that it\u2019s something like a chinese instagram) regarding the show and how it really was behind the cameras. Apparently, he was told by the writers who he should choose to date (hence why he dated seoyeon) and there was overall a lot of pressure put onto them by the writers and production team. The post is really long and he deleted it as soon as he posted it so many people doubted if it was a real post (because not many people had the chance to see it and right now there are only chinese translations of it on weibo), but the screenshots have been going around weibo for a couple of days and everything mentioned in it happened in today\u2019s episode, meaning that it had to be written by someone who knew what happened (Egeon). Lana has also hinted on Xiaohongshu that they were told what to do in some occasions.\n\nPeople on weibo have also been talking about how someone from s1 also made a video after the show ended, in which he mentioned how the show affected his psyche and mentioned briefly that he couldn\u2019t go into details because of a contract of some sort, alluding that they were told what decisions to make too. So it seems like it really is scripted and that this has been going on since s1.\n\nI honestly feel really sorry for them because after reading the post it seemed like it was a really exhausting situation. Also, I can\u2019t believe how the writers keep trying to push a relationship between Soomin and Lana when his possessive behavior is a huge red flag.\n\nIf anyone is interested I can share the screenshots, but be aware that there are spoilers about the final episode and about who Egeon and Lana\u2019s final choices are. Also, all the screenshots are in chinese but most of it can be understood if used a translator.\n\nSorry for the long post and my english, since it\u2019s not my first language lol. I didn\u2019t want to get into too many details to not spoil things but yeah, it\u2019s really sad how the show is managed.",

If Egeon was forced as well to date SY this also makes a lot more sense.\n\nCould you please share the screenshots? I'd be interested to read them. Thanks!",

I downloaded the pictures and used iphone\u2019s feature to translate the selected text from the pictures. It worked pretty well and it was pretty easy to understand taking into account what we have been seeing throughout the show.\n\nIn this post\u2019s last pic there\u2019s a screenshot of Lana hinting that sometimes they were told what to do:\n(https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4850516036683742)",

Shame on the PD team for forcing ppl to do stuff they didn't want to. I feel like Seoah's rejection of Kangrae was also scripted, it came out of left field.\n\nI want to hope that Chae hee and Soo min's obsessiveness was also scripted but it didn't seem like it. Ugh poor cast being put in uncomfortable situations. The PD team is so dumb because viewers actually want to see ppl have chemistry and come together organically. I root for couples that genuinely vibe with each other. Like, why did they try so hard to split up Lana &amp; Egeon?? Made zero sense.",

It\u2019s really sad because it\u2019s not fair for neither the cast nor the viewers, who want to see genuine interactions.\n\nI hope that chaehee and soomin\u2019s attitudes are scripted too but I feel that if they were egeon would have mentioned it on his post too, and that he wouldn\u2019t have felt as frustrated when he talked to chaehee in ep 6, as he would have known that it was scripted\u2026 or maybe he just has great acting skills and was acting the whole time idk hahahah.\n\nI hope they have the chance to talk about it once the show ends but I honestly doubt it.",

THIS SMELLS SO FALSE. Seoah pushing away Kangrae just to feed the script of \"DoHyung and KangRae fighting for the princess with their utmost will\". Ri-di-cu-lous.\n\nI would be happy to see the screenshots of Egeon and Lana disclosures if possible? Thank you!",

Soomin has been rejected multiple times and his complete disregard for boundaries is beyond alarming. \n\nThen he gets mad at the people in power for separating him and Lana after chasing them around all day and basically demanding that they put him with Lana?! It felt like borderline intimidation and was just infuriating to watch. Like you are 34 years old, you should not be having these temper tantrums. He needs to grow up and learn how to let go and respect people\u2019s boundaries. It\u2019s maddening!!!!\n\nI really like Seoyeon but I hope Lana and Egeon work out their misunderstandings and end up together. They seem like a much more compatible match.\n\nSeoah is a QUEENNN.

The way he was shaking his head with such sick pleasure when Lana was surprised they went to the same college.  Lana being the attention of his unhealthy obsession must have felt some spine tingling aversion to him. She told him so many times she is not into him in so many ways.

I'm usually pretty forgiving with my level of \"Suspension of Disbelief\", but this episode was just too much...\n\n* Seoah cutting off ~~**both**~~ Kangrae ~~**and** Dohyun~~ for no good gosh-darned reason.\n* That massively cringy, over-the-top, poorly acted wake up scene between Egeon and Seoyeon.  It was so horrifically awful that even Bomi threw up her hands and asked, \"Are they filming a commercial?\"  When the **panel** gives up on the show, you know the PDs have failed.\n* The Beach Game pairings made no sense.  Why would Lana ***voluntarily*** pair up with Soomin for the Beach Games?  The only possible reason would be so she could sabotage Soomin by simply walking out of the ring once the starting bell sounded.\n* The Beach Game final Mixed Doubles match, where both Kangrae and Dohyun gently princess-carried their partners out of the ring (and out of harm's way) before Dohyun's \"upset\" win to get the final \"Person With Power\" privileges.\n* Before moving to the bedroom for the final night, Lana's attempted reconciliation scene with Soomin was not even remotely believable.  From everything we've seen in the previous episodes, Lana has zero motivation to repair the relationship with Soomin.  Why would she even try at that exact moment?\n* Most of the bedroom pairing chats (from the first bedroom pairings) were left on the cutting room floor.  People walked to the bedrooms and then it was morning before the Beach Game event.  Was the acting in those bits so bad that even the PDs felt ashamed to air it?\n\nThe only honest part about this episode was Kangrae hurting his face to win the final date with Seoah.  However, that was offset by how scripted all of his lines felt during the actual date.\n\nI hope the PD team seriously reflects on their performance before doing a third season of Eden.\n\nEdit: Fixed the emphasis on the Seoah point.  Dohyun's non-consentual kiss is clear justification for Seoah to cut him off.",

Give it a rest.\n\nI don't get why korean people constantly point out other people's crying when they're trying to hold back tears lol i would hate that so much\n\nDamnnnnnnn SA is just executing all her suitors one by one tonight, so savage but also impressive. I guess she's the one strike and you're out type. It's like she suddenly decided, \"Actually, no, i don't need to put up w you dilly dallying/getting to know other people, or rushing me. I'm out.\"\n\nI wonder what the rest of her time on the show will be like??? The other 2 men are out too right? It would be cray if she suddenly decided to pursue SM lol \n\nBut honestly good for her, jiyeon from last season was just friendly to everyone only to reject them all at the end. She played the game. SA decided to cut things off the second she made up her mind. I think the kiss made her feel like the men saw her as easy and she decided to put up some firm boundaries.\n\nYo i did not expect DH to be that strong. I'm excited to see this on single's inferno next week lol. \n\nSoyeon's winning ceremony \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 i love her \n\nKR explained himself really well to SA. I hope she gives him another chance! Lmao i was so anti-KR at the beginning, i guess i'm easily swayed. Or maybe he just seems cool compared to DH and SM.\n\nUmmmmm weird for lana to tell SM on the last night she's suddenly open to him? Huh?

                                    "comment": "If anything, that made the show look a little *more* real...It looked completely plausible that the PDs 'failed to inform' the cast that co-ed bedrooms would be part of the show, and Sungjae's reaction would have been completely appropriate.  He would have to consider his longer-term career, and appearing and what he may have *thought* would turn into some 19+ content would have been highly detrimental.\n\n...But that's very, **very** different than the intrusive scripting we're seeing in S2.  Omission is different than outright lies.  Withholding info in order to witness an on-camera surprise is a different level of fraud than telling a cast member to make specific choices.  That's no longer reality TV; It's just cheap drama: Untrained actors in a play without paying for a script.  One is lying to an actor to show an honest reaction; The other is lying to the audience with a scene devoid of truth.  And it's the scenes of poignant and shocking truth which makes makes it so compelling to watch.\n\n----\n\nAs a side note: There's a reason why reality TV took off in the U.S. during the scriptwriter and entertainment industry strikes in the 80's and '90s.  Reality TV was a union busting tactic to get around the absence of union screenwriters [WGA West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America_West)/[WGA East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America,_East) and union actors like [SAG/AFTRA](https://www.sagaftra.org/about) during strikes, or as leverage during union negotiations.  The unions eventually caught up with Reality TV, but it took multiple decades.",

Like there has to be trust between cast and production and it sounds like there wasn't, since all this info is coming out.",

Quite a healing show for me, hoping they'll make a new season in a new country.",

            "comment": "**The Barber of Seville (2019)**, they (Lee Min Jung, Shinhwa's Eric and Andy, DIA's Jung Chaeyeon, and Kim Kwang Kyu, etc. but it's mainly that ajussi barber, Lee Nam Yeol) do haircuts in Spain, lol.\n\n**Trans-Siberian Pathfinders (2019)**, it has Lee Sun Gyun, Kim Nam Gil, Lee Sang Yeob, Kim Min Sik, and Go Kyu Pil, and so on for the cast. The Trans-Siberian Railway is really boring, hard, et cetera, check the Youtube videos. But there are people like me that have always wanted to also do it for the sake of the journey.\n\nI think this year or so (maybe for sure in 2023) they're finally doing those abroad/outside of Korea variety shows (and Kdramas) again, so expect new ones to be announced.\n\nLike Lee Hyori recently went to Canada. It's called **Canada Check-In (\uce90\ub098\ub2e4\uccb4\ud06c\uc778)**.\n\nOr how about that new Kilimanjaro climbing show, **Once in a Lifetime, Kilimanjaro (2022)**.\n\nBtw, some Kpop idols have their own Youtube channels and vlogs where they talk about their touring and vacation time in the USA. Search up KCON 2022 concerts or like the many other festivals/concerts this past few years. Videos or vlogs or even reality shows about those with idols should appear.\n\n---\n\nBtw, in **Ainori Love Wagon: African Journey**, they also climb Kilimanjaro with more regular people, lol.\n\nAinori Love Wagon (it's a Japanese dating show) in general travels around many different countries and they show you like the food, cultural practices, poverty, etc. alongside the hilarious/ridiculous situations from the cast.\n\nFor international Netflix, it has **Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey** and African Journey. But the whole Ainori series has way older seasons (from the 2000s) that have no English subs and are only available in Japanese Netflix/sites.\n\nAnd **Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81)** is kinda like Ainori Love Wagon but in China. Basically they're university students that are having a field trip, lol. So they get missions/dates/etc. They got them islands.\n\nTwinkle Love has a lot of friendships formed in the show. Like it's one of the best shows for that, you can see them shipping each other and so on, lmao.\n\nTwinkle Love is available on YOUKU or the YOUKU channel(s) on Youtube. This is particularly good if you want to go back/forward to that freshness of young adult life ([btw, flamingos and parrots are geese] (https://www.reddit.com/r/heartsignal/comments/ns11y8/friends_share_life_terrace_house_twinkle_love/)).\n\nFor Twinkle Love, at the end of each day they have to record a message for the person they liked/spent time the most. And listen to their own message (through earbuds) IN FRONT OF EVERYONE, so it's kinda dramatic af, lol.\n\nTwinkle Love or \u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81 Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxP-Ye9kr24\n\nTwinkle Love Season 2 Episode 1 Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78vUkTAhuG8\n\n---\n\nAnyway, some dating shows do have that traveling countries/regions/etc. component, so look at the description pages on MyDramaList or so to check if they do travel outside Seoul or Korea and so on.\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and more info on where to watch them: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zpwve5/dating_show_recs/j0v9q6u/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/znemtw/i_fell_in_love_with_korean_dating_shows/j0h5xw3/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/ https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zlml4b/ramyun_chill_episode_5_finale_221214/j06e2lh/**",

The concept is they essentially  open a Korean restaurant in a foreign country and interact with customers. Fun fact, it's a spin-off of Kang's Kitchen, which is a spin-off of New Journey to the West (so it's a spin-off of a spin-off lol)\n\nIt's kind of the opposite, but Youn's Stay has foreigners come to Korea and stay at a Guesthouse",

Individually or in pairs they've gone to bali, thailand, japan, and london. They're abt to have another ep in vietnam this week.",

I think their chemistry is good bc no one is trying to be a comedic focal point and it feels a little more natural. Even though the situations are still contrived (fortune teller, psychiatrist brothers), I like these kind of storylines more.",

Because she's too ridiculously accepting of his backstory, she's are too kind and understanding that you cannot fathom to believe it's real.\n\nBecause putting off from texting your blind date for 14 days are just ridiculous thing to do, especially if that text just 'innocent text - she just thank him for his time n tell him she already given the gift to her mom'. Kim jong kook reaction is similar to my reaction to that segment, it's just maddening.\n\nTho i enjoyed 2 dating coaches are too good in giving advice tho their love-life are also similar with LSM, jong kook getting all emotional n invested over someone else love are funny to see. N there's kin jong min with his emoticon loving self\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.",

I usually just choose the segments I'm interested in and move on. \ud83d\ude05\n\nTo your point, I do find it a bit cringe if they're serious and are showing their dates on-screen. I wish at some point they'll just interact off-screen, and then the show just makes references to it once in a while.",

The entertainment industry in many progressive countries has a higher than normal representation from the LGBTQ community.  Korea has what? One openly gay man?  It extremely naive to think that the industry hasn't got many more closeted stars forced to go on shows and have sham relationships to prove they are straight.  Sad really and not helped by fans constantly trying to matchmake stars.",

Isn't it normal for a person like him to be scared of opening up to a new girl and making another mistake after so many hardships in life? Of course he will not be as confident as he used to when he was younger and be more cautious with his decisions.",

That's the most interaction I've seen I think.\n\nBut even more than Mijoo, I want Jeon SoMin and the rest of running man and Dreamcatcher interaction. Why can't they invite these girls on RM?",

Thus the show sometimes includes things that i-fans consider distasteful, such as waist measuring and height jokes.\nBut I saw no fan caring about how the show calls their own hosts pigs, ugly, etc.\nSome guest idols did as well.\nIt's simply the humor standard in Korea.\n\nThis comment is from the old post, If you're talking about Black Pink episode the answer is no, the episode went well w/ no backslash, a lot of popular idols got hit by a toy hammer as well like IU and nothing happened.\n\nHave you seen BP's lightstick? Yes it's a toy hammer, and it's inspired by the toy hammer from weekly idol that's enough to tell you that they love going to variety shows like this",

They're most on crazy diets and workout programs. \n\nThe first thing a host of a show says to a female idol being that she has gotten fat is ridiculous, insulting and downright triggering. Most of these girls battle eating disorders because of their job! And the one I'm talking about wasn't even fat. Like not even chubby. Not even normal healthy looking. She was just \"not so skinny it looked like she would faint any second\"... Which is how she used to look. Btw, a few girl group members HAVE FAINTED on stage and off because they were starving themselves. \n\nPlease don't excuse this type of insensitivity and BS. It's not a cultural thing. I'm actually Asian. It's offensive here too.\n\nEdit: ok, but why did you block me? \ud83d\ude02",

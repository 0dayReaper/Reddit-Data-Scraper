    "postText": "As you all know, YJS got the Daesang at the Baeksang Awards. Congrats to him, so proud of him as he is my favorite MC. But can we just talk about the differential treatment between the other director who got the other Daesang vs when Yoo Jae Suk. Seeing how the actors/actresses all stood up for the direction during his speech but to see them failing to even clap or stand up for YJS (even though he is such huge sunbae), really turns me off with these actors when some of them are still rookies and some have even went on RM with YJS. As a matter of fact, some of them who did and stood up were in fact veteran actors, which shows me how disgusted these actors must think how much more superior they are. Don\u2019t hit me with the excuse that they are tired or anything like that, cause they sure did stand up for the director. One of them was even super hyped by YJS and earned some of his popularity through Running Man and didn\u2019t even care to clap at all. EXCUSE ME THE AUDACITY.",

Some of the actors who were sitting down even had 'grumpy' faces and had their legs/arms crossed. If you don't mind me asking, who is the one who was hyped by YJS and didn't clap for him?",

He alone won over all dramas, directors, actors, shows from all stations and only some of them stood up for him. That is so disappointing :(\n\nAnd while watching, there was an actress that stood out a lot for me. Literally whenever a winner went up on stage and the camera was showing the whole audience, she just sat there with crossed arms. No standing no clapping whatsoever. From what I have seen she only stood up for the Daesang-winning director Lee Junik. She was wearing a black dress and seemed like a young actress.\n\nEdit: so I searched for her name and she is Park Juhyun. K-netzs seem to have noticed the same thing. Her video has a lot of dislikes\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPbjzaTrOFY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPbjzaTrOFY)",

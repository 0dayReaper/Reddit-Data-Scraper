Feels like such a long time ago in the context of the year, but SSAK3 really helped me cope this summer and it's so cool they're donating all the profit! Shoutout to the fans as well who bought the casettes/posters/digital albums!",

This year I think YJS is a clear favorite. Any other result would be a pretty major upset.",

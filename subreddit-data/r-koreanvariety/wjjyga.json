    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nThis is a bit off-topic, but I've been a moderator for a bit over 6 years now, and I also did the Shows of the Week thread in its early stages for more than a year, back when VIU and ODK suddenly started subbing a bunch of new shows and an overview of subbed shows were sorely needed (credit to /u/IClurker for starting that particular project, we also made the [MuDo Masterlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/wiki/mudo_list) together). I also did a bunch of discussion threads on new shows as /u/yoossi_, if anyone remembers the moniker.\n\nI will now be stepping down. I don't really follow Korean Variety shows that much since Infinite Challenge ended, and it's just a matter of time before I become inactive. I don't think I've been doing that great of a job this past year or so.\n\nSo a few months back, we recruited a couple of new moderators to the subreddit, and I think they've been doing a good job so far. Plenty enough for me to think the subreddit will be in good hands going forward. I will stay on for the time-being to help out if needed, but will eventually remove my moderator role.\n\nWill try to update most of the users flairs to new reddit before jumping off, some of you might've noticed them starting to appear on the new reddit already, in addition to the post flair icons. I've also sent the other moderators all of the users flair images from the old reddit, so they're available.\n\nI'm sure I've ended up on the bad side of some of you, having to remove threads or comments, but I've tried to remain fair and follow the rules. There's always bound to be some disagreements over stuff like that. Just know it was never personal.\n\nSo, what is this post? Just a goodbye. I feel like I've put in enough hours to help keep order to make a post about stepping down. Korean Variety shows had a huge part of my week for a long time, and I've really enjoyed a lot of the discussions on here. The subreddit only had 6,000 subscribers when I joined as a moderator, it's not 164,000 and seems to just grow continuously. \n\nI hope you all continue to enjoy variety shows, and the subreddit always need contributors, so make threads, or help out in other ways. If the episode threads with links and stuff seem daunting, just make a plain discussion threads, or start a discussion thread about some interesting topic. It's always good that the subreddit stays active.\n\nI don't know how to finish long text. That was all I had to say.\n\n\ubb34\ud55c... \ub3c4\uc804!",

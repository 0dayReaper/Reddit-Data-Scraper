In contrast, I've agreed with every take Hong Jinkyung has had so far (she's my fav panelist). Like she said, Soe has rehashed the same conversation 4+ times with Yoongjae, and yes, he could have been more straightforward with his responses, but ultimately he didn't reciprocate her feelings and directly stated he liked Seoeun. How many more times does Soe need to clarify his or her feelings before she gets a clue? I wouldn't want to spend an entire night with someone who would rather be somewhere else. imo she made the right choice by choosing someone else (Hanbin) for a relaxing night off the island instead.",

Se-Jun must\u2019ve been telling the world what his ideal type was because everyone was damn near confused too. \n\n* I like that Seul-Ki isn\u2019t pressed about JY\u2019s popularity and she\u2019s willing to reflect more on her choices too. It would\u2019ve been a little much if she was acting distraught like YJ was.\n\n* JY basically eventually admitting to other women that Seulki made his heart race the hardest LMAOO bye he\u2019s so unserious\n\n* \u201cThis is war\u201d. Seulki pleasee!!! LOOOL\n\n* Se-Jun assuring So-E in the helicopter was nice, it shows he\u2019s really attentive and JY just smirking when he spots it like a kid who saw something he shouldn\u2019t have LMAOOO you can\u2019t convince me this man is real \n\n* Min-Su\u2019s occupation is very impressive as well! We got all the girl-bosses gathered I love it\n\n*  I wasn\u2019t sure and I gaslit myself so much but when I watched The Glory I knew I saw So-E!! So her major makes sense omg she\u2019s starring in films while still in University thats amazing. \n\n* Se-Jun saying he brought her to paradise because he wanted to show her he doesn\u2019t think of her as just a friend\u2026okay intentional man we love to see it!\n\n* In all honesty, it\u2019s So-E\u2019s choice whether or not she will reciprocate his interest or curiosity. I would hate to see people treating her as if she\u2019s better off choosing someone that likes her even if she doesn\u2019t like them back. If she\u2019s comfortable being friends with everyone Im on board with that too!\n\n* JY and Min-Su\u2019s date was very nice, JY is just all around great vibes and I\u2019m happy Min-Su seemed to really enjoy herself \n\n* Nadine\u2019s gonna have to put her foot in the door, all is fair in love and war girl!\n\n* I like that Seulki is very honest with her feelings. It\u2019s what I was saying earlier about So-E, its not because someone is nice to you that you should date them you really have to feel it otherwise you\u2019re going to hurt the other person later down the line even if it\u2019s not intentional\n\n* I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just reading too deep but Seulki looks more real to me in her confessionals now, like I feel like she\u2019s so full of expression you can see exactly what she\u2019s feeling its very nice compared to the very shelled seulki of the beginning episodes. Even her crying after reading the passage JW gave her like she cannot hide her emotions and I really relate.\n\n* The men being nervous for the game was making ME nervous lmaooo\n\n* All the people that worked harder lost the games thats funny \n\n* I was internally screaming at So-E, that\u2019s it that\u2019s all\n\n* Seulki and JW\u2019s bonding moment was very endearing. \n\nr/netflixsinglesinferno",

It's a dating show but there's also the game and I feel that Seulki, played the game the right way with appealing to Jungwoo, so that Jinyoung is even more interested.   Also,  for some reason I think as viewers,  if Jungwoo threw out Jinyoung himself,  knowing he's this army guy,  we would have more respect for him and might even make Seulki more attracted to him.

But not when the person is really into you like that; you can crush their feelings.  Plus, I don't think she wants to go to Paradise with him.  She will out of kindness; not because she wants to.  However, I'm glad he gets to go to Pardise.\n\nSoe conversation with Seoun I hope was orchestrated by the producers.  It was SO cringey to watch.  It made Soe seem desperate.  Although, I think she should have given Sejun an opportunity.  \n\nI don't like Dongwoo.  Something about him give me asshat vibes.  I think since Seulki turned him down that he feels she shouldn't be interested in Jinyoung.  Like Jinyoung is a threat to him over a woman that doesn't want him.  Or he doesn't like the fact Jinyoung is the popular one.  But I do like Jinyoung he's unbothered by the other guys.\n\nNadine can't catch a break.",

I felt emotional seeing how Jung Woo got emotional and hung in there by sheer determination. I got knackered by the end and done working out for the day. \ud83d\ude02\n\nDong Woo should have been more strategic with the group wrestling instead of going all in against Jung Woo right from the start. I get they are fighting for the same girl but Jinyoung is basically everyone\u2019s competition, girl-wise and strength-wise. Dong and Jung Woo should have tag teamed against Jinyoung and got him out right from the start to make it a fairer playing field for everyone.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t even a need to get Se Jun out like that because let\u2019s face it, no one is fighting for So E. All the men practically cheered when Se Jun went to Paradise with So E. \ud83d\ude02 Se Jun was also stunned like, \u201cWhy me?\u201d, before giving up and marinating in the sand. He is quite the funny one and made the group conversations in Inferno more fun. \n\nYoong Jae was the strategic opportunist expending the least amount of effort while he watched like a vulture from the side. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI really liked the group wrestling because it showed intention for their intended picks. It is also nice to see when all that muscle and aesthetics can be put to actual physical use. \n\nThe female wrestling was weak though. They all fell within 6-7 seconds with little effort. Season 1 had stronger females.",

As in lacking a foundation built on an authentic spark or connection with another human being. \n\nTechnically, he\u2019s always doing stuff \u201cfor\u201d her, but I\u2019m struggling to remember an instance where he\u2019s done something based on *her* specific preferences or interests. He def treats her very kindly: bringing her supplements when she had heatstroke, helping her in the kitchen, the poem thing, etc. But if someone edited those scenes with a different woman on the receiving end, and SK\u2019s name was left out, I feel like the scene would play out the same way. In other words, his behavior feels generic. It\u2019s like he\u2019s motivated by amassing the most amount of brownie points with her vs building depth to their relationship. He has good intentions, but as a viewer, I feel like all these favors are for his own satisfaction that he did all the right things, and not for her as a person with her own mind. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m with you on rooting for nice guys and underdogs but for some reason I feel like he\u2019s not genuinely a nice guy? Obv he\u2019s not a dick, but he strikes me as someone who can\u2019t communicate directly (or as directly as is socially acceptable) because he\u2019s terrified of rocking the boat. My partner was watching with me and said he doesn\u2019t know why he finds JW annoying when he\u2019s such a nice guy, and I realized that JW\u2019s niceness only comes out when he\u2019s making progress with SK. Like after the women\u2019s game, when he and SK would be together on inferno, he was way happier for those going to paradise than he\u2019d been before. It just feels hollow compared to the guys like HB or JY who actually seem nice no matter what happens.",

Jungwoo always find Seulgi for talks in tent\n2. Jungwoo always with Seulgi walking somewhere\n\nThis is suggested by Jinyoung's dialogue in which he expresses his feelings that having Jungwoo around makes it difficult for him to spend one-on-one time with Seulgi and his observation that Seulgi is constantly chatting with Jungwoo (could be onsided from Jungwoo).",

But I got surprised when he left JY with SK, it was very mature of him tho. I actually find JW-SK pretty cute together, but if these two are together then there would definitely be a power imbalance in their relationship and it wouldn't last long anyway.",

He just hasn\u2019t had the chance to chat with her and whatnot because he keeps going to paradise. Jongwoo is something else tho\u2026 I really don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to end but lowkey feel like jinyoung and seulki will end up together. \n\nYou can tell in her body language that she likes jinyoung back. I think the reason why she was \u2018flirting\u2019 (idk if that\u2019s the right word but yea) with jongwoo was because she wasn\u2019t sure if jinyoung liked her or not and just wanted to be with jongwoo to make him jealous/back-up/etc\u2026 this my opinion tho",

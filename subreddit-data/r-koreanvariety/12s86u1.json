highlights.**\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~1' NF Miss: **(NF 17)** takes a sideline kick-in with a low shot on net that **(SF 707)** blocks and redirects out of bounds to the sidelines!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' SF Miss: **(NF 17)** stops to change direction but **(SF 23)** gets her foot on the ball that is shot towards the net with a non-threatening rolling ball that **(NF 9-GK)** picks up!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' NF Miss: **(NF 17)** takes a sideline kick-in with a deep shot on net that is off target to the right side of the net, out of bounds for a goal kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~4' NF Miss: **(NF 17)** takes a sideline kick-in with a deep low shot on target that manages to miss all defenders feet, **(SF 67-GK)** gets her foot on it to block it but the ball is in the air, **(NF 11)** manages to get her foot on it and the ball is shot off target to the right side and smothered by **(SF 67-GK)**, **(NF 11)**'s shot was difficult with **(SF 707)** in her way!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~5' NF Miss: **(NF 17)** takes a sideline kick-in with a deep low boucing shot on target that **(SF 777)** blocks, but the resulting ball rolls at the top of the 16 yard box where **(NF 123)** gets to and kicks a close pass to the right for **(NF 11)** to take a shot on target, her shot is blocked by **(SF 707)** and hits **(NF 11)** in the face, and **(SF 707)** kicks out of bounds to the sidelines!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!5' NF GOAL: **(NF 17)** takes a sideline kick-in with a quick speedy low cross to the feet of **(NF 11)** who one-time redirects towards the goal and **(SF 67-GK)** lets the ball go through her legs, kinda looks like **(SF 777)** got some of that ball, **(NF 11)** boxed out **(SF 777)** well to have great positioning to get the redirection!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~5' SF Miss: **(SF 23)** takes the centreline kick-in with a shot on net, that misses the left side by meters!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!6' SF GOAL: **(NF 17)** takes a sideline kick-in with a quick speedy low ball that **(SF 23)** tries to trap with her feet, the ball goes down to the sidelines where **(SF 22)** and **(NF 17)** fight for the ball, **(NF 17)** gains control and attempts a back pass to **(NF 1)** but **(SF 23)** steals the ball, controls it with a soft touch and blasts a super power shot to the top left corner for a beauty of a goal, NF defensive gaffe, there is no way a goalie can save that ball with its power and aim!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' SF Miss: **(SF 777)** takes a sideline kick-in with a power pass down the line that **(SF 22)** gets to but her first touch is terrible and loses the ball, **(NF 17)** kicks the ball forward and **(NF 11)** hops over the ball but the ball is set up perfectly for a subsequent shot on target by **(SF 777)** who shoots from far away aimed for the bottom left that **(NF 9-GK)** catches perfectly and smothers!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' NF Miss: **(NF 17)** takes a sideline kick-in near the centerline with a deep lobbing shot on target that **(SF 67-GK)** misplays as it hits her right foot, redirects to **(SF 777)** who kicks it out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' NF Miss: **(NF 17)** takes a sideline kick-in with a high lob cross, **(NF 123)** was out of position to attempt a header redirection!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' SF Miss: **(SF 777)** takes a sideline kick-in with a power lob cross, **(SF 707)** charged into the net attempting to connect on the header, so much speed and momentum she dislodged the net from its position, second time **(SF 690)** is subbed in, she hasn't played many minutes and could this be a strategy by Coach TaeYoung to rile her up when she is full of excess energy?, **(NF 11)** goes to the sidelines!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' NF SUB: **(NF 123)** is subbed off for **(NF 11)**!&lt;\n\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9 NF Miss: **(NF 17)** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot on target that **(SF 707)** heads out of bounds to the sidelines!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~10 NF Miss: **(NF 17)** takes a sideline kick-in with a power cross that **(SF 67-GK)** punches forward, the ensuing ball is eventually out of bounds for a sideline kick-in for NF!&lt;\n\n\nHALFTIME SCORE LINE: &gt;!------- SF 1 - 1 NF------------, game is a bit sloppy without crisp passing, good defensive display by both teams, JeolMi might not be sub option as they said she was injured and not in top form, she is however dressed in full uniform!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' SF Miss: **(SF 23)** takes a sideline kick-in with a deep power shot on net that **(SF 690)** heads the ball and it goes out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' SF Miss: **(SF 23)** takes a sideline corner with a cross that **(SF 690)** heads the ball, the ball drops to the top of the 16 yard box where **(SF 777)** traps with her right foot and shoots on target through three defenders with her left foot that is smothered well by **(NF 9-GK)** leaving no rebound with **(SF 22)** at the doorstep to kick in!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' SF SUB: **(SF 22)** is subbed off for **(SF 01)**, SF is in their optimal formation and players same as NF!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' NF Miss: **(SF 777)** takes a sideline corner with a cross to **(SF 01)**, but **(NF 690)** intercepts the ball and dribbles forward, she manages to shoot a weak shot forward before **(SF 707)** can block it, **(SF 67-GK)** easily picks the ball up, **(SF 707)**  falls hard to the ground during the play but is okay!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' NF Miss: **(SF 777)** takes a sideline corner with a cross to **(SF 01)**, but **(NF 690)** intercepts the ball and dribbles forward, she manages to shoot a weak shot forward before **(SF 707)** can block it, **(SF 67-GK)** easily picks the ball up, **(SF 707)**  falls hard to the ground during the play but is okay!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' VAR Review: possible hand-ball violation on **(NF 17)** from a sideline kick in, a penalty shot is awarded to SF, the ball was re-directed by **(NF 17)**'s arm as she was turning, SF shooter is **(SF 23)**, no change in NF goalie!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' SF Miss: **(SF 23)** takes the penalty shot with a low shot down the middle and slightly to the left that **(NF 9-GK)** blocks but there is a slow rolling rebound that is now in play,  **(SF 23)** manages to take another shot but **(NF 9-GK)** blocks that and there is no other follow up offensive chance from the rebound.  Good following the play after the shot by both **(SF 23)** and **(NF 9-GK)** as the ball is live after the shot is taken!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' SF Foul: **(SF 707)** steps in the path of **(NF 11)** as she was receiving a loose ball that bounced her way, a body check forces **(NF 11)** to the ground, a direct free-kick is awarded between the 16yard box and the centre circle, not close and not far!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' NF Miss: **(NF 17)** takes the direct free kick with a shot on net that is aimed for the near side right post's top corner, goes over the crossbar!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' NF Miss: **(NF 11)** puts pressure on **(SF 707)** after she received a rolling pass from **(SF 67-GK)**, **(NF 11)** manages to steal the ball and takes a shot that misses the near right post with a rushed shot!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' NF SUB: **(NF 690)** subs off for **(NF 123)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' NF SUB: **(NF 11)** subs off for **(NF 690)**, as a precaution as **(NF 11)** was holding her right knee and hopped off to the sidelines, not something we want to see!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' SF Foul: **(NF 17)** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot towards the net that **(SF 23)** blocked with her right arm that was in the air, a little bit iffy as she wasn't purposefully using her arm to block the ball but rather her arm was up to protect her face, a direct free-kick awarded in a very threatening place, between the top of the 16yard box and the center circle slighty skewed to the right, looks like **(NF 690)** will shoot!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!16' NF GOAL: **(NF 690)** takes the direct free kick with a power shot on target that is aimed for the wide top left corner, cannot blame anyone in SF for not stopping that missle or blame EuDDeum for a somewhat weak handball foul call!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' NF SUB: **(NF 123)** subs off for **(NF 11)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' NF Miss: a loose ball drops in front of **(NF 690)** who sees the ball's trajectory and her position and leaves it for a better positioned **(NF 11)** who winds up for the shot that goes high and misses the mark, great sense and there was no real shot on target since SF defense were well positioned in front of the net to block the shot!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' SF Miss: **(SF 707)** kicks a foward pass to **(SF 777)** who controls the ball and cuts to the middle and passes the ball to the other wing that **(SF 23)** receives and kicks back a pass to **(SF 777)**, but **(NF 690)** blocks the pass and the ball rolls towards the NF net and **(NF 9-GK)** comes off her line to kick the ball out, **(SF 23)** slows the play down and turns back and back passes to **(SF 01)** who takes a shot that is horribly off target!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' SF Miss: **(SF 01)** takes a sideline kick-in with a deep shot on target that **(NF 9-GK)** smothers, would not have been a goal if it directly went in!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' NF Defensive Stop: **(NF 17)** kicks a bad back pass that bounces towards **(NF 1)** but she doesn't get to it, the ball is now loose with a chase between **(NF 1)** and **(SF 23)**, **(NF 1)** gets position and boxes out **(SF 23)** and kicks the ball out for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' NF Foul: **(SF 23)** takes a corner kick with a back pass that **(SF 01)** whiffs on with **(NF 690)** charging into her and the collision ends with **(SF 01)** on the ground and the whistle blows the play dead, a direct free-kick is awarded near the centreline, **(NF 11)** is subbed out for **(NF 123)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' SF Miss: **(SF 23)** takes the direct free kick with a shot on target that evades the defensive wall and gets through very deep but **(NF 17)** blocks it, the ball is still in play as it bounces around and goes through the legs of **(NF 17)** and **(NF 9-GK)** moving laterally to her right manages to grab the ball in time before any SF players can get a shot on net, the whistle blows to end the game!&lt;\n\n\nFINAL SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- SF 1 - **2 NF**-----------, although the game didn't display the best of technical skills, both teams played with desperation and effort, Woman of the Match for me would be Myeong SeoHyun coming up big with timely saves, Nah MiHae had great shots and improved her play, SF got better in their build up but still lots of room for growth on their end, looks like ChallengeLeague 3.0 will be very unpredictable, all the teams have a chance to be suspended or promoted!&lt;\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!BD v WW, a battle of skills, will BD come out desperate? will WW outmuscle and intimidate BD? Coach DaeSe looks very animated!&lt;",

            "comment": "This was kind of messy but not bad considering both are newish teams (I consider NatFam newish since they had to replace almost half the team). Minji's pk was quite beautiful too but dang if Seohyun didn't save the team countless times from those pks. She's improving quite nicely and her ability to come out of the post to clear was great. In fact, the ribbon and ability reminded me of Irene during her heyday. \n\nAlso kudos for HeeJeong for playing that hard after just healing from her injury. Her defense and pressing helped shake up Streaming Fighters and stabilize Minji even if Minji was still very much flitting about the field like a manic animal. I was confused at first about Coach Taeyong benching her for so long but now I see it's to make sure she doesn't burn herself out or accidentally overdo things due to her speed and passion. Once she gets a few more games under her belt, I can see her developing into an even better player, perhaps one of the best in the entire show too. \n\nCongrats to &gt;!NatFam for finally winning a game after the glory of the first season with Jungeun. They needed this victory to push them to try again after countless crushing defeats. Too bad SF lost the match but they also needed this defeat to ground them after winning their first two matches. With this, I hope they put more effort into playing as a team and learning to pass even if it'll take time for it to pay off since they obv can't rely on quick counterattacks against all the teams anymore. Also hope 1weekdieter/Juyeon takes the defeat in stride and work on improving her mobility because while her attitude and luck got her thru so far, her stiffness and slow reaction means other teams that have players who are good at/near post can overwhelm her. Also Coach Jinchul's attitude and words afterwards solidifies him as the most wholesome coach for me, tough when he needs to be but can tell when her players are having a hard time and knows to comfort them. !&lt;\n\nNext match looks tight in all meanings of the word. My gut tells me it's Wonder Woman but then again, I've literally gotten every single match prediction wrong so idek anymore. Kyungseo looks like she's out for vengeance so either way, it's gonna be a super heated match.",

As for the tactic regarding Minji think it is a mistake the more minutes she plays the more goal opportunities NatFam will have. The free kick was a think of beauty but if HeeJeong didn't get injured then Minji wouldn't even be on the field as she was subbed just before.",

FC Gukdae would have played better if she was playing the whole game.\n\nThe same can be said for FC Streaming too. They were playing YeaWon as a defender, instead of a striker, because JeolMi was injured too. They could have done better with EuDdeum and Yeawon as strikers and JeolMi with KkangMi as defender. I guess they would need YeaWon's speed and aggressiveness to cover MinJi. But suddenly they lose their offensive threat with only EuDdeum as one-top.",

            "comment": "Bummed about World Class. Gaevengers is my least favorite team but they are such disrupters during games (mainly due to Hye-sun) and the physicality Seung-Hye plays with. They got lucky to end up with what appears to be either a good goalie or a lucky goalie with how she played in the shoot-out. If she had been like most new goalies the shoot-out would have easily gone in WC's favor. Also, come on Eva, what was that rookie kick? \n\nIt's interesting that the announcers don't ever mention the threat of suspension for the losing Challenge League team. Every CL team has played once and this match has FC NatFam, who are in last place, playing. You'd think they'd mention how big this game is for them and how if they lose, especially by multiple goals, they are highly likely to end up in last place of the CL. Which, as far as we know, means they would be suspended. So why don't they mention it? \n\nGood for Heejung, getting her first goal and right after her brother made one too. \n\nGreat play and kick by Euddeum. She is just... she's real good and has ace potential. Due to her natural athleticism, fitness, dedication to training and natural talent with soccer she is already good. But her next season? Ace. \n\nSadly, seeing Jeong Eesoo on the field full time makes me realize she is bad, and in a particularly bad way. She is not only a total newbie, not only slow, not only tepid, but she unnatural looking playing the sport. That likely means she will for a long time be a black hole when on the field (not only doesn't add any plus value but makes mistakes so she adds negative value) and that at best, her ceiling, is to be extremely average. Not fast, not accurate, not powerful, not anything but average in all areas, at BEST. Thankfully she's a backup and Jinjeolme, who looks much more promising, though in this game her playing hurt seemed to reduce her effectiveness. \n\nAll in all, it looks to me like NatFam exploited the immaturity of StreamingFighter when it came to their buildup, their passing and their spacing. SF were predictable and didn't have an answer for NatFam forechecking. Classic messy newbie soccer with people clumping together and kicking balls straight into their opponents, turning the ball over. \n\nIt was nice to see NatFam get a W. I didn't realize it had been THAT long.",

                    "comment": "The thing with Eesoonal that baffles me even with taking the lack of conditioning in mind is that she looks so lost on the pitch. If you have watched alot of football on TV, especially the Arsenal of late or during the peak Wenger era you must have picked up a thing or two about positioning, off the ball and good decision making as they were the prime example of how to play smart football. PSY was a 'football watching/loving beginner' and she had all of that from the start of the show. \n\nMaybe when she's trained up she will show us something similar, because I think she just looks overwhelmed by the high tempo of smaller futsal fields. It's like the Premier League and EudDeum/YeahWon feel like a fish in water while she is that new signing from a smaller league abroad. :D",

I know very little about soccer and have basically played zero sports (beyond the occasional casual baseball, tennis, volleyball, basketball games with friends) and yet from basic sports knowledge I would bet everything I own that the thing I would get right if you put me in a futsal match right now is spacing, positioning and being aware of angles (for passing and shooting). As an amateur expert who breaks down soccer film and reviews play, I am baffled by her playing like she has never even watched a soccer match before. I'm pretty sure I thought, when the team, her and her career were first shown that I had thought something to the effect of \"well, she'll at least know soccer basics; positioning and such.\" I was so wrong.",

From the very beginning of the show we had players with amazing shot technique and yes they scored a few free kicks/kick-ins, but were always aided a bit by bad goalkeeping. But now &gt;!we have back to back banging freekick goals with 'unstoppable' shot placement with a nasty curve in top corner! I'm also amazed at SeungHye's penalty and last weeks freekick. She might have the entire shows best/most accurate kick with BoKyung and HeIn with that curved placed shot of hers.  !&lt;\n\nIt's also surprising that EudDeum doesn't shoot like a beginner at all. She's the first one on the show that consciously took a longer touch to better line up the ball for a little run up into a power shot. That's what all real strikers do when they have a bit of space and time. In fact all of her teammates at SF don't play as beginners on a individual lvl (as a whole team they are very n00b yes :P). I do feel very sorry for Eesunal, she didn't look very good this game, but if you watched the talk on EudDeums YT you know why she's struggling...",

What a power shot, what hustle to evade, what delicious soft touch to set up her power shot.\n\nAnd SeungHye's penalty shot was even more impressive.  She totally aimed for bottom right corner and it went there perfectly.  \n\nShout out to HeoMin for keeping the streak alive which i thought would have ended.  I loved how she followed the ball even though it got through her.  That kind of tenacity and sense is great.\n\nI thought having EunHyung shooting last was a reason Gaevengers would lose.

But the thing in GK and Defenders in general sometimes has either decision making and outplaced issue sometimes that results on collision on other teammates or kiling the build up. \n\n\nFor her that\u2019s big issue, skill wise she barely do a passing/complete the pass and being pivot and vice versa which that attributes on her no existent ball handling. Which is the reason why their team is dead on build ups that they only rely on open space or long ball thru Heo Kyung Hee. - The build ups and pivot from goal kick to foward the ball to FW/ST is depends on fullbacks and wing can handle the ball.\n\n\n[You\u2019ll notice on Top Girl plays Chae Rina can switch up the position from back to centre forward since she can connect Yubin thru pass play and rebuild while rebounding the ball to prevent the counterattack on mid to pass it either Kim Bo Kyung or Yubin. And that team itself isn\u2019t shy to pass back the ball all the way to Ayumi and tilt it again to reposition. For Yubin her role is to be a net for incoming broken plays, corner kick-in and set piece extender. She and Chae Rina already shown a showcase of being press resistant at back.]\n\n\nPlus it\u2019s Giants old habits after all, passing, dribbling/touches and defending. None of them can either atleast has technicals like Park Sun Yeong, doesn\u2019t need to be explosive or flashy just a efficient ball technique so they can harness Lee Hyun Hi and Heo Kyung Hee at front.",

Her and HyunYi are among the tops strikers in the league. By putting them in position, the other team can't help by shoring up their defense. FC Gavenger will need to pull one striker down to cover these two players. Saori and Naty may have been speedy and skillful, but in term of physicality FC Gucheok is even more scarier. We will see what Coach PyongLee comes up with to lessen the impact.",

Her and Ang Ye Won has shown some propect to be their own team best players.!&lt; For Nat Fam the build up still flat but &gt;!they made right choice to put Na Mi Hae on wing/mid instead of Kwak Min Jeong that stretch ball options for Hwang Hee Jeong and Kim Min Ji. Speaking of HHJ and KMJ - both players shown improvement at ball handling they\u2019re not swiftly losing it and has a poise to retain it **at least**. For Kim Min Ji if she manages to stay injured-free and laterally improving her basics especially that ball technique/dribbling- definitely an ace in making.!&lt; And those 2 also generates the goal to lift themselves up on table.\n\n\nOverall the **problem** for both team is fluidity of passing and completing it like majority of league. Plus both team defense is somewhat iffy in few occasions because sometimes there\u2019s a moment they\u2019re just standing straight up on ball course just to get dribbled out and left behind making the back open wide like Kim So Yeon did.\n\n\nSince team has some players who had physique and speed - it would be a great opening for them to capitalize it if they managed to overcome that **problem**. It will paved way for them for long balls, attacking and pressing more effective and intimidating for latter. For a potential possessed on each team - you don\u2019t need to worry **whether the plan will work if you correctly executed it, gradually an opening will come.**",

I am gonna chuck it in a disappointing week category for me.\n\nFC Streaming:\n\nWhat is the purpose of ESoonal again? For somebody who watches a lot of football and dating a pro player, I would have thought some of the skills would seep over (see Gukdae players). Guess I was wrong. EeDddeum is just pure beast with great potential to be a polished players. YeaWon is just energetically hilarious. Her \"trapping\" just made my day. You can see that Streaming players felt a bit more confident in handling the game. Kudos.\n\nFC Gukdae:\n\nThey are getting there, but physically still weak overall. MinJi freekick was so beautiful. Overall all of the players played with confidence and helping each other out.\n\nBoring sloppy week it is everybody. I guess it can't always be fun week. Let's take a rest this week.",

New goalie did well, specially saving Elody\u2019s bounce back!&lt; \n\nKim Minji is slowly becoming overrated. Her skills are a lot better and &gt;! She did have the best shot of the game and for the whole CL so far!&lt; However, it\u2019s a team sport. She needs to reign herself in which is probably why she was benched. HeeJung also overrated, she\u2019s clearly not skilled as the show keeps saying but she does make up for it with her tenacity and stubbornness. MiHae underrated, her kickins threaten SF multiple times. Biggest win for NF is SeoHyun stepping up as goalie, saved them multiple times. I would have told SF to start shooting higher cause she cleared all the ground shots like a beast.\n\nI like SF a lot, they all seem to understand positioning well. You can see how naturally engrained it is when they set their defense. Euddeum is the only one who seems to have improved since last game. Yewon had some good shots but I think having her cover for JeolMi as a defender was a mistake. Her and Euddeum could start high pressing like Naori combo. Eesoo makes me wonder why she\u2019s on the team. Sure she was added late but she has the all the knowledge and has been training for 2 months. You would think she would show some results by now. She\u2019s running around, out of shape and completely messing up the d line. KkangMi had a lot of mistakes, the build up was a total failure. She should just dribble thru if they give her they much time. Also don\u2019t know why they were so focused on trying to get her a header for their set piece. &gt;! Dieter could have saved the first goal, went right thru her legs. She saved some similar ones in her first game. Second goal, nothing she could have done that was a curved bullet!&lt;  \n\nNext week, BD coach is no more \u201clet\u2019s have fun! Do what you want like their first game\u201d lol. Man was yelling until he was red in the previews. Also KyeongSeo playing aggressive could be a good thing, but could also be a bad thing. It is a team sport so if she all the sudden plays ego ball then who knows \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

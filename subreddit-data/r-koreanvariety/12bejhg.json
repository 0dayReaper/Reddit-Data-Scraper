    "postText": "Wondering why baseball player Kim Taekyun\u2019s family has not been appearing on recent episodes of Return of Superman. Does anyone know? Used to look forward to their episodes and clips until they just seemingly left or were dropped. If I\u2019m not mistaken, the last episode Harin appeared in was Ep 433 back in June 2022 as seen here: https://youtu.be/VgYWKZV43dw",

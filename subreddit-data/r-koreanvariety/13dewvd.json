It\u2019d be crazy to start from the beginning and be committed to watching like 1,000hours to catch up. Also since these shows have been going on for sometimes over a decade, these shows often dip in quality. So its better to just start in the middle following entertainers/idols you like.\n\nThe only thing I disagree with is the Jung Jong-Yeon path. His work after The Genius is very different and I personally don\u2019t like them in comparison to The Genius. To me that is a path of disappointment. I\u2019m not saying that those shows after The Genius are bad but maybe its best to watch them before you watch The Genius because the lack of strategy or increased amount of scripted parts really ruined those shows for me because I watched The Genius first. \n\nInstead I would submit The Genius spiritual successors as the preferred path. Going from The Genius&gt;Time Hotel&gt;BloodyGame&gt;Physical100. I think each of these shows added a twist to The Genius format that keeps them fresh and gives them their own identity.",

New Journey to The West is great as well. 3 Meals a day is a good show but much more laid back. There's Youn's Kitchen, Korean Hostel in Spain. The main denominator is PD Na(not for Infinite Challenge though). He has a youtube channel,Full Moon where he plays games with tv show and movie casts as well as k-pop groups and it's english subbed too. I live alone, How do you play are great shows.",

It got the korean type of editing but more open to international fans)\n\n  \nThe \"classic\" that I still watch : Running man, 2 days 1 Night.  \nFor those 2, I recommend to start with RM. If you can go from the first episode you'll see the developement of each cast members, there role in the show and how there relation develop along the years. Be warn : there is more than 650 episodes. But still recommend it.\n\nAmong the new show, Earth Arcade (2022) should be fun to watch. The Second Season will come at the end of the year I think.\n\nIf you want an order : \"Busted\" (Netflix) \u2192 Earth Arcade \u2192 Running Man  \n\n\n2 Days 1 Night, I want to recommend the third season but amongst the member there was (and still) a trash, and the new season, the beginning was really hard for them and us. I don't recommend to watch it, not now at least. Still classic tho.  \n\n\nThe list is not big list but It should be a good starting point, in my opinion.  \nAnd there will be other people that will said there \"essential\".",

And S3 is the best season of them all. \n\nThough the real classic for Koreans is X-Man, it's not actually objectively good and is just nicely nostalgic for Koreans. And back then the Korean industry haven't really made a style of its own, so X-Man feels much more like Japanese variety show (which was leading back then).\n\nOther genres:\n\nThe Genius (all 4 seasons have totally different charms): It made its own genre of survival show and birthed several legends/legendary moments. Well crafted. \n\nAbnormal Summit: Cable shows started to takeover and this show showed why. A bunch of foreigners interested in Korea talking about differences in culture. This show is a really good introduction to K-variety.\n\nFinally:\n\nAll Na PD shows: from 1 Night 2 Days until Jinnie's Kitchen, Na PD went though the different changes in Korean Entertainment and reflected it in his work. He's not just essential but quintessential to K-variety. Amongst his show I'd pick an underrated one he dropped, The Human Condition. I'd say Na PD went from being maximalist to minimalist in his approach, and Human Condition was in between. \n\nHis maximalist approach was channeled through Kang Hodong, his in betweens by Lee Seunggi, and finally his minimalist approach by Lee Seojin. They were all great evolutions lol.",

(viki)\n\nFriends (viki, watch this after watching the Heart Signal Korean seasons, you need the context because this show invited the popular cast members back from HeartSignal to make a spinoff show)\n\nThese are all shows that I love which are relatively short and easy to binge. There are quite a few really popular Variety shows that have 500+ 1hour 30minute episodes that would be hard to catch up on because typical these shows have a lot of filler.\n\nI am hesitant to recommend any of the most popular shows that have like 500+ episodes because you can\u2019t find any of them on netflix or viki or the streaming site only has like the 50 latest episodes, but for the most part there is a concern about quality with these long running shows. Most of the cast has been shaken up multiple times due to cast members getting cancelled, different PDs changing the direction of the show, and the simple fact that after 500+ hours of content they start running out of new ideas. If there is one that you try to get into it should probably be Running Man since that is the most popular show.\n\nThe way I like to watch these variety shows is by looking up some of my favorite Idol personalities or comedians on mydramalist and then looking at their tv appearances to see what episodes they made guest appearances on. Shows like, I live alone, The Manager, 2days1night, How do you play. Then typically the show will hook me in and I\u2019ll want to keep watching more episodes of the show until I get bored of it and drop it. \n\nHere are some of my alltime favorite shows that might be harder for you to find sources to watch from.\n\nThe Genius (subreddit - best thing korean entertainment industry has ever made, and is the main inspiration behind the shows Time Hotel and Bloody Game)\n\nTime Hotel (currently airing)\n\nSixth Sense\n\nEarth Arcade\n\nShanghai Share House (subreddit -chinese)\n\nAll that PingPong!\n\nPs. If you haven\u2019t watched the drama Hospital Playlist you have to watch it. Best korean drama ever made. Also, they did a youtube camping show that was amazing, as well as the special variety season of Three Meals a Day: Doctors.",

            "comment": "The first variety show that got me hooked was I Live Alone\u2014still am a fan up to now and it\u2019s been a regular part of my weekend. It has its ups and downs, normal for shows that span for years, but imo this year they\u2019re getting back there. Probably difficult to find older episodes (you can try the kisstvshow etc), but I recommend the 2018-2020 eps as they were the best years of the show. \n\nThen I became a fan of Amazing Saturday and The Manager: shows with good vibes! Amazing Saturday particularly has great cast chemistry\u2014really feels like they\u2019re close in person.\n\nI also like Na PD\u2019s shows, New Journey to the West, and their spinoff\u2014Spring Camp and Kang\u2019s Kitchen. Too bad tho that they don\u2019t seem like they\u2019ll produce more seasons for NJTTW, i don\u2019t care so much for Na\u2019s current Youtube shows. \n\nI don\u2019t have access to Viki so Idk if they\u2019re on there, but I Live Alone, Amasat and The Manager are in Viu. Earlier episodes of Amasat can be found on dareumi1 twitter account\u2014she was subbing the show before Viu picked it up around 2021-ish.",

I think that your personal profile is going to be extremely important to what you could start watching.\n\nAs someone who watches nothing but Korean variety shows and a couple of Taiwanese variety shows, here's what I watch right now, in order of day of the week:\n\n**Radio Star** (talk show, you'll probably only like it when familiar guests are on the show)  \n**Shooting Star** (ladies football (futsal) show, very popular and if you like football)  \n**Yoo Quiz on the Block** (talk show but less formal and and focused on current affairs/social themes instead of guests)  \n**Beat Coin** (fixed cast sometimes with guests that have to go through tough challenges based on the flip of a coin)  \n**No Math Trip** (fixed cast on a trip overseas where they play games and challenges to see who gets to eat and sleep well, with punishments for losers, ending soon)  \n**I Live Alone** (reality everyday life observation show, I live alone too so I enjoy it a lot and can relate to it)  \n**Bloody Game 2** (survival reality show)  \n**Earth Arcade 2** (fixed cast on a mission overseas who have to play many mini games to be able to enjoy their trip, can watch the Earth Arcade 1 as well)  \n**How Do You Play** (fixed cast doing random things, not always fixed)  \n**Knowing Bros** (fixed cast with guests that go through interviews and later play games for fun to promote their new work)  \n**Amazing Saturday** (fixed cast with guests who have to guess lyrics of Kpop songs and challenges to win the right to have food)  \n**Let's Play Soccer 2** (fixed cast of Korean sportsmen and celebrities who formed a football team)  \n**Running Man** (fixed cast sometimes with guests who go through different themed challenges with prizes for winners and punishments at the end for the losers)  \n**1 Night 2 Days** (fixed cast who go through different themed challenges to showcase different parts of Korea with signature punishments for losers)  \n**My Ugly Duckling** (reality everyday life observation show of unmarried celebrities who make their mothers worried that I can 100% identify with)  \n**The Genius Paik** (celebrity chef and celebrities facing the challenge of setting up restaurants in different countries to promote Korean cuisine)\n\nSome variety shows that have ended and I enjoyed are the **New Journey to the West series, 3 Meals a Day series, The Great Escape series, The Genius series, Society Game 1 and 2, Busted series (Netflix), Crime Scene series** and quite a few of **Baek (Paik) Jong Won's variety shows** because I like food and cooking.",

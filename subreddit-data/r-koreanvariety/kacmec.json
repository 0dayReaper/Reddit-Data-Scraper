How often have you seen her as a guest on another show that didn't directly relate to her music. I've only ever seen it when she's on one of YJS' productions and often it looks like it's part helping out a friend with promoting their show and part just having the opportunity to have a reason to catch up.",

After PD award and High Excellence these past 2 years, I think this year will be daesang or nothing for KJK. He quietly having good year in SBS just like last year.

They even started a #GoldenChildDisband on twitter and writing really spiteful comments about Jangjun. This situation is beyond ridiculous. \n\nAs a K-ARMY, I found the video very lighthearted and funny. I really don\u2019t understand why all this backlash is happening. Maybe I-ARMY sees it differently? No one in Korea made it an issue because it\u2019s a non-issue. In fact, K-netizens found Jangjun really funny and reacted positively. \n\nThis toxicity is one of the many reasons why idols don\u2019t do much in variety shows. They\u2019re so scared of backlash and negative press by being themselves or entertaining.\n\nhere is the video and judge it yourself. \nhttps://youtu.be/5bbu-0Mf-70\n\nEDIT: \nPlease do not send any death threats to Jangjun or Golden Child. A fan told me that Jangjun\u2019s dad is a police officer. Sending death threat is like the worst idea ever LOL",

Your idols are millionaires/billionaires and powerful --- any equivalent they have, from politicians to sports figures, get mocked and criticized because that's how you keep the whole system grounded. Bigger icons have been copied for their iconic moves or vibe -- this shouldn't be a big deal ugh. There isn't a dichotomy where if they're not worshipping, therefore they're insulting. I need fandoms to see that. \n\nThere's been more than one instance of idols and non-idols having to awkwardly sidestep talking about kpop (esp the big groups, god) because of how thin-skinned fandoms are. Everything is disrespect and, god, \"degrading\". This parasocial relationship is just cult-level now.",

Armys and blinks are literally the most toxic bg and gg fandoms.

Bts was once treated badly just bcoz they didnt have a big fandom but now that the fandom has gotten big, the fandom has became even more toxic. \n\nIts the idols who teach their fandom how to behave. Bts can still take some time and talk with fans abt how disrespectful they are. I know a lot of idols who talk with their fans when their fandom does something disrespectful. Bts go live on vlive but cant talk abt this??? Are you kidding me??? Bts definitely know what armys are doing on twitter. All idols know what their fandom does on twitter. \n\nAlso im not targeting bts. I am just saying they need to teach their fandom some basic things especially now that there are lot of new fans. Surely they can spare a few minutes for this or are they too busy for that???",

There are a lot of famous idols that have talked about hardly making any money once the company took their share. They also aren't that powerful, in Korea idols are pretty much the bottom of the fame food chain.\n\nBut I agree fandoms do have a weird victim mentality, especially when you consider the fact that they are 'defending' men who are in their late 20s. BTS fans are pretty notorious for this, which is really cringey and unfortunate.\n\nOverall through unless you're a small celebrity or an idol, fans getting angry doesn't really do much to that person. They fans are annoying and disrespectful on social media and might send emails to the company demanding some kind of nonsense, but that's usually all.",

I swear it feels like they\u2019re trying to find things to be mad about.\n\nIn the west we see celeb impersonations ALL the time. Idk why i-army are getting so fckin sensitive over something we see all the time on tv. \n\nHonestly i just wish reality shows wouldn\u2019t even bring up bts sometimes. Half the time a lot of k-celebs and idols end up being dragged just for even associating with them since their fans are so extra. I feel bad for them really\u2026.",

Their boundaries shouldn't be more than korean culture itself. I might called them ignorance.

Yeah manager stan.. as a veteran ARMY myself, I feel sooo sick to have wild(?) baby ARMYs.. they couldn't managed their obsession. I'm fine if people call ARMY a toxic fandom, but bear in mind, usually veteran fans should be our reference. Not all but mostly new fans so ridiculous like a cult. + ofc there's someone outside the fandom put on MSG to the issue(?)..",

Trending a whole ass hashtag and demanding an apology over this?? Even when we bring up the fact that BTS has done similar impersonations in the past, Armys will throw all the excuses in the book to defend their victim narrative. At some point, they must realize how cult-like their behavior is, right? Losing morals over Kpop?",

This is def one of the reasons why army fandom are considered toxic with like almost every little thing that a person does that correlates to bangtan, they'll get mad. stop. ya'll are not getting anything but proof of toxicity to self (or own fandom).\n\nJangjun (also Mijoo) are like considered to be an entertainment idols in variety shows because they (most likely only them) were able to present themselves with their entertaining personality for the audience. With this ridiculous hatred to JJ, as mentioned above, some idols cannot even do the same by showing something entertaining, afraid of negative comments like this ridiculous hate to JJ. just\u3161stop.",

I\u2019m sure they existed and got flooded out by backlash to their backlash but I just want to say not all I-ARMY is like that especially older ones.

Fans need to stop using this logic that if you don't see it didn't happen or it isn't that much. For the size of the fandom, it may be little to you but that little amount can cause so much harm and if it's encouraged by fellow fans instead of being stopped is what makes it worse.

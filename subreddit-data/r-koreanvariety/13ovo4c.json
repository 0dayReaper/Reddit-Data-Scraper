I loved the Italian women talking about Singles Inferno and how non Asians (basically) think about the conservatism they display in regards to coupling up, being affectionate and sexual. \n\nI was happy to see the reason for the increased customers came about organically from the reporters/journalists. I don't enjoy these shows much when you either suspect or it's confirmed that they are getting customers due to their celebrity and advertising that they're filming a TV show. Then all their sales, their success and so on is flimsy at best and fake at worst. Of course they get some benefits a real restaurant wouldn't, like the filming, the celebs and such but if those are kept fairly low-key, it's still a real fun watch.",

Like the edited version showed each group of customers being seated, given menu, order taken and served before showing another group of customer, but in real life the part timers and John Park would have had juggled multiple tables at different stages of dining and managing and serving drinks to the waiting customers. Top it off with various interruptions like customers asking questions and other members needing help, I'm pretty sure that overwhelming really fast.\n\nAlso none of them (except BJW) really had experience in running or working in a restaurant.\n\nGood thing Jang Woo was somewhat consistently doing dishes to keep the service going.",

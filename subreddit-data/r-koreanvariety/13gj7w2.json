They were such downers. Maybe the ratings for season 2 were so bad that Viu decided not to invest in the licence to show season 3. \n\nViu, it is not the program, it is the season 2 actors who were bad. Season 1 actors were a hit which is why they\u2019re back again in season 3!",

Maybe im just a little biased bc I like them as actors and seeing them in a variety show is a new experience. \nI respect your opinion. I agree that maybe they didn't get the license bc they have paik and earth arcade already.",

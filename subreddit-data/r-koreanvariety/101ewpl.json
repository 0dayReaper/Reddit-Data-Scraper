Hoping we get more and more like that this 2023, and also, wishing they could have trip again within major cities (eg. Seoul, Incheon) like going to big universities something like that.   \n\n\nAn attempt to have soccer game during those days, not a good time for &gt;!Dindin!&lt; XD",

Though on this episode, they brought back the travel aspect by showing the pretty Santa village and the historic village/hanok.\n\nMr. Cramp here could've applied to be the 3G member back in S3. And he's playing dirtier and dirtier too LOL. Love it.\n\nStill hoping Lee PD will do the Brutal Winter Camp at some point. The Winter/Summer Camp episodes always been the one of the best/memorable ones for me.",

The games were all so fun and the broomstick soccer was a chaos. I feel sorry they used World cup theme song for the broomstick soccer due to the members's lacking skills lol. And Jung hoon was a riot too, from being too passionate to his legs gave in and his team exaggerated it into having cramp - the passionate oldie foul king has come a long way, I love that he's unexpectedly evolving into new characters nowadays. And when Jung hoon lying down on top of Seon ho, so precious. They must feel so comfortable with the new maknae.\n\nFrom the preview, they're having the harsh winter camp. Oh God, they practically went to KBS Entertainment Awards straight away after filming that trip, they were really insane.",

He said he looks up a lot on Jongmin.\n\nI think none of the members from any seasons mess up a lot with the oldest (for reference Kang Ho dong, Kim Seung woo, and even Gutaeng hyung). So I think it's just their thing, to put respect on the eldest member. And this season members don't really sabotage or being savage with each other too. I think none of the members ever met Jung hoon anywhere prior to 2D1N, and he 'was' assumed to be in 'elite league' so it's understandable why he was seen as unapproachable before.  \n\nImo Jung hoon WAS one dimensional and didn't really have a stand out character (in other word 'boring') during the 1st year, but I would say that he has a lot of character development after that which is nice, he still has the serious demeanor and silent charisma but nowadays he becomes a lot playful. Maybe the younger ones need to be more brave and competitive to face him off.",

    "postText": "So I saw this trailer of a new show on JTBC\u2019s YouTube channel that\u2019s gonna come out on the 25th of this month. I can\u2019t read Korean so I don\u2019t know what the name is but it\u2019s a cooking show I think.\n\nIt caught my eye because I love cooking variety shows and also it looks like the first guest is my favorite soccer player Hwang Heechan \ud83d\ude29. I hope they sub this show on an accessible website because I need new shows to watch and I need more Heechan content other then Wolves YouTube channel.\n\nEdit: found the name of the show it\u2019s called Koreans' Meal Tray\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rKp4QrWA8vw",

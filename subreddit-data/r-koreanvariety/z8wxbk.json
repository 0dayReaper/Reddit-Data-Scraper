    "postText": "Hey all - visiting my family over the holidays at the end of the year and I want to set something up so that my older parents can watch Korean TV easily. \n\nRight now, I have my mom set up with a Viki account and also an account at SBS.co.kr to watch the shows and reruns she likes from her iPad. \n\nMy dad only uses the SBS account to watch sports and news. \n\nThis works well for \"newer\" shows but I'd love for her to be able to watch \"older\" shows when she's bored such as 2d1n season 3 or older K dramas that are mostly available on the popular popup riddled sites which are horrible on mobile devices without adblockers. \n\nI don't mind paying a small monthly fee for easier access for a less technology friendly person - eventually it would be great if she could access the same content across her iPad and TV (apple tv? or some other device?)\n\nOpen to all options and ideas, thanks!",

You can check out the drama and variety shows to see if it would be useful for your parents tastes and shows they like they do have some older dramas and variety but no past seasons of 2d1n ): It also korean news airings from JTBC, KBS, MBC, MBN, SBS, TV Chosun, etc",

It's what my parents use and there's a lot of older stuff on there as well as shows that are aimed at an older demographic.  \n\nI'm not sure how the app is but I just hooked up old laptops to their tv's and bought them bluetooth keyboards/mice and they seem to navigate the site fine after a bit of guidance.",

Navigating videos on the website from a touch screen isn't the smoothest experience but it's better than nothing.",

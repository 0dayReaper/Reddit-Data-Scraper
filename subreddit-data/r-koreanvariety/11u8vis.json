    "postText": "I have decided to watch Busted last week and managed to watch until episode 7 of the first season. I watched it mainly because many people were telling me that it is very similar to Great Escape. However I am confused about it. I really like the cast, but the show feels like something is missing. Firstly, the editing is really weird, it feels like the parts are just glued to each other. I also really cringe during scripted parts. I came to conclusion that I don't like scripted shows. The first season feels like there is no specific genre to the show, it is a bit of everything and therefore I lose the focus. \n\nSecondly, I don't find the humor very amusing. I am just curious if I don't get the jokes because I am not familiar with Yoo Jaesuk and his \"line\"? I feel like there are many inside jokes that I might not get because of it. Also I don't quite recognize the references and sometimes guests. For example in Great Escape I enjoy the jokes because I am very familiar with the cast and watched them for years in other shows. So I ask myself if I will get the jokes in Busted after giving it more chance. \n\nAnd lastly and mainly I am not satisfied with riddles, games and challenges. They are way underwhelming compared to Great Escape. \n\nTBH I really hate to drop something and prefer to finish a season to give the show a chance. At this point I am a little bit hesitant to watch Season 2 after finishing this. Is the second season better than the first? I assume that after Seunggi joins, I will have at least two familiar faces in the show including him and Jongmin. Also are second and following seasons better in terms of challenges and feel like less scripted?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all of your recommendations, I went through the first season and made sure that it is not my cup of tea. May be in future when I will have nothing else to watch I will go with other seasons too.",

They each have their own detective personas and characters to play (more than regular variety shows) but the outcome of whether they solve the case of the day or not depends on the guys. \n\nThe second and third seasons have more of an overarching mystery but the first season served to set it up. Some things finally get answered in the third season that were set up in the the first. \n\nI think if you go into it accepting that it\u2019s part Korean drama and part variety show then you\u2019ll be able to like it better.",

            "comment": "It's definitely a personal choice. The show (+ other shows from the same PD like New World) have a mixed reaction on the subreddit because of the scripted nature, but I honestly *love* it. It feels like CLUE haha. Rather than GE, I feel like it's similar to GHSMC because that show is more story based + has less puzzles. \n\nOf course, it's probably because I have a soft spot for the show (I remember getting together with my friends and binging and theorizing) but even I admit it can't beat Great Escape. \n\nS2 definitely amps up the anty (best season ngl) but if you didn't enjoy the lore with K and the detectives, then you probably won't enjoy the rest of the show. Just like some of the GE episodes, the story connects across seasons, aka more scripts.",

They scripted PMY to act a bit like a know it all and cold when she is the opposite",

                    "comment": "Most of the scripting on the show was tolerable to me because I understood that it was meant to tell a story. But the PMY scripting was the worst part. I hated how they tried to make her look like the only capable and smart one, while everyone else just looks on in forced awe. It doesn't even make sense because we all know that YJS and KJM are extremely smart people. LKS is also smart and resourceful, as is the rest of the cast. It also restricted PMY into playing a very specific role instead of being free and funny. My favorite moments from her were where she was being silly and laughing and I wish we got to see more of that.",

            "comment": "I think the confusion is because it's not really similar to great escape, it's more similar to crime scene or even the genius. Also, I think it was an attempt to lure global audience in so the usual kvariety tropes aren't highlighted that much and it's mostly scripted as well. If you don't like it after 7 eps then you probably won't like the rest and the next seasons.",

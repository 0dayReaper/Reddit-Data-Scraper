    "postText": "I\u2019ve always wondered what format do y\u2019all think works the best when trying to produce actual couples? \n\nI think formats like Heart Signal and Terrace house (Japanese Tv Show) were the best for the amount of couples they produced and I Am Solo for the amount of married couples it produced. Heart Signal didn\u2019t have a variety of people but they filmed for a month so it gave them actual time to develop feelings. Terrace House also didn\u2019t have a lot of people but they did bring in new people when someone left and they also filmed for a longer period of time. I Am Solo filmed for a short time but they had more of a variety of people and most of them are actually looking for marriage.\n\nI like all of them but I wish there was a show with like a mix of the formats like I Am Solos concept with Heart Signals filming time. Imagine 12 men and women who want to get married live in a house for a whole month that would be nice. If y\u2019all know a show like it let me know but what format do y\u2019all feel like works best or seems more genuine?",

Co-living set up like Heart Signal and Terrace House but with older participants, almost the same age group as I Am Solo. \n\nPS: Love is Blind Japan was also good.",

            "comment": "There's shows like Divorced Singles (\ub3cc\uc2f1\uae00\uc988), it's up to Season 3 now. There's also Serious About Marriage (\uacb0\ud63c\uc5d0 \uc9c4\uc2ec). iheartu2 is subbing one of those divorced or marriage Korean dating shows.\n\nOh, don't forget Love Is Blind: Japan, lol.\n\nA list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and Kdramas, East Asian films, et cetera, and more info on where to watch them: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/12ccjku/can_someone_give_me_a_list_of_korean_variety/jf16a56/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/12bduuc/new_offbrand_terrace_house_set_to_start_this_may/jewxvfh/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10yej01/singles_inferno_confirmed_to_return_for_season_3/j7zqw31/\n\nAnd yes, Ai No Sato (\u3042\u3044\u306e\u91cc) or Love Village is coming soon on Netflix this May 2023. Heart Signal 4 (Korean Version) is also probably releasing around that time.\n\n---\n\nFor producing actual couples, they definitely need more than 1 week or so. Some people even say they want a 1 month or more to really see if it's possible.\n\nTerrace House's average stay in the house was like 3 months or so per member, I forgot, check Wikipedia for the intervals with the new Terrace House housemates. Or this thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/y2fj74/the_stats/. You notice this as they get new cast after several episodes and remember each episode is like 1 week or something like that.\n\n---\n\nI Am Solo is kinda an outlier as most of the people on that show are not what many others would call as conventionally attractive, physically/visuals-wise. This is me speaking as a straight Asian male that grew up in Asia and the Americas and with some background on genetics/phenotypes/etc. \n\nSome of the decent/good visuals were: \n\nEpisode 19: maybe Jungja and Youngsook (runner)\n\nEpisode 25: Youngsook (still the best kawaii)\n\nEpisode 31: Oksoon (the girl that looks like Blackpink Jisoo)\n\nEpisode 39: The real OKSOON (how is her story real, need proper interpretation), and Jungsook (the one that voiced League of Legends Akali)\n\nEpisode 45: Youngsook, maybe\n\nEpisode 51: Youngsook and Oksoon\n\nEpisode 59: Sunja, maybe\n\nEpisode 69: Sunja, and Youngja (short-haired model)\n\nEpisode 76: Oksoon, maybe\n\nEpisode 84: Oksoon\n\nThen for the male housemates:\n\nEpisode 19: Youngho and Jungsik\n\nEpisode 25: Youngho maybe Jungsik\n\nEpisode 31: Youngsik and Youngchul (what a lot guys aspire to be for looks)\n\nEpisode 39: maybe Youngho and Kyungsoo\n\nEpisode 45: Youngsik (idol vibes) and Sangchul\n\nEpisode 51: maybe Youngsik\n\nEpisode 59: Youngsik (so dapper, fashion) and Sangchul (masculine archetype)\n\nEpisode 69: Youngsik (looks like some actor)\n\nEpisode 76: Sangchul (the only one from the Single Since Birth season)\n\nEpisode 84: Youngho (this guy's hairstyle in the beginning, lol)\n\n---\n\nWtf, this randomly turned into a ratings/etc. comment. Anyway, point is that I Am Solo has noticeably reduced visuals and this is due to the concept of the show and applicant pool and so on. \n\nSo if you were like the people mentioned above, it'd be hard to create a relationship as the attractiveness levels (in terms of the face/etc.) of the others are not up to par. It's a sad reality that people of similar looks date each other, instead of dating up or down their expected social/visuals/etc. stations.\n\nWhen getting married, people will sometimes settle or be okay with somebody that's not as attractive as them. But again it's that initial attraction that will often be the catalyst for an actual budding relationship.\n\n---\n\nIf you look at the shows with divorced singles or older people, or like say Change Days with the breakup or not while living with also similar situation couples setup, the visuals are just not comparable to other dating shows. As like the agencies or the individuals themselves know that they can try to get recruited in the shows with better budget and casting and so on.\n\nSo for the theoretical show to work, they need to have some serious backing. Some of Netflix's Anglo or western dating shows actually have disappointing visuals too, like for Too Hot to Handle there's some variety but the standards are sorta lacking.\n\nHell, the first season of EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560) let people down in the visuals department if you compared it to the other dating shows around that time. And then you see in the second season they finally got people like Tae I (bad boy motorcycle highlights guy) and Yihyun (the tsundere that looks like no:ze).\n\nFml, I'm talking too much about visuals but that's the unfortunate reality. If you look at the pairings or couples formed from these dating shows, they are usually attractive enough to each other or society and so they have increased likelihood of matching in the first place.\n\n---\n\nFor example, if they had the male housemates of Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774), like Kang Taeyang. And then the female housemates of Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac), like Hyojin. Then it would've been a crazy show. \n\nHopefully the upcoming Heart Signal 4 (Korean Version) has a well-rounded cast like that, May 2023 is only a month away and so teasers for the cast/etc. should start appearing soon. \n\nVisuals gods, please grant us a visual couple, 2022 was legit the year of visuals couples somehow not working out in the end, smh lol.\n\nThis is in a swimming pool, in front of the rest of the cast, the legendary introduction for the male catfish (new guy, not part of initial cast) of Pink Lie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8mgBIZgd9I\n\nBelow are the direct links to TVING/Love Catcher in Bali clips, don't worry it's not really spoilers as they're just chilling.\n\nThese are the female housemates of Love Catcher in Bali: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpPl9mP35ik\n\nThese are the male housemates of Love Catcher in Bali: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VawZKpDWIY4\n\nLove Catcher in Bali actually has an insane handsome visual with Jeonghyeon, but there's also Hanu and so on in Pink Lie. \n\nOverall, Love Catcher in Bali just had way better female housemates and the other Korean/Chinese/Japanese dating shows are not close, so that's why imagine if they had that whole group for Heart Signal 4 (Korean Version) in a different timeline.\n\nThere's also Dana/\ub2e4\ub098 from Love Catcher in Seoul (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \uc11c\uc6b8): https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zx36d6/who_are_the_legendary_or_iconic_cast_members_of/j1ykx1k/\n\nAnd Choi Yihyun (\ucd5c\uc774\ud604) from EXchange/Transit Love 2 (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc5602): https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zx36d6/who_are_the_legendary_or_iconic_cast_members_of/j1yg36b/\n\nAnd right now for Yes, I Do Season 4 (\u559c\u6b22\u4f60\u6211\u4e5f\u662f4), there's Xu Zihan (Aria Xu): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqkOGp2dQqw&amp;t=2504s\n\n---\n\nAs for the amount of people, usually 6-8 is the feasible one due to like storyline editing and so on. Otherwise there'll be less screen time for particular individuals and situations and such things.\n\nHonestly, Korea should legit just license Terrace House off Fuji/etc. and do the rotation thing. They kinda did that with Roommate (2014) but it's like a celebrity variety cohabitation show.\n\nThey usually do these Korean dating shows in the pension/vacation/etc. homes and so it'll be just fine. If they add big bonuses or encouragements for the relationships, it might be forced or rushed but that's one way to guarantee people trying for protentional matches. Otherwise it'll probably stay as more of like a promotion thing for their brand/business/et cetera.\n\nYou know another show that's actually somewhat successful with couples/marriages/etc. after the show is Ainori: Love Wagon. The dangerous and foreign situations help form that environment of us versus them.  Same when they're dealing with the production staff with them. That type of survival/etc. situation can help accelerate bonding and so that's why it looks surprising as they're just going from places to places or from country to country with a small budget. But in reality, that minimum spending/financial means also contributes to that solidarity or feeling of being in it together.\n\nThe producers and so on legit first have to advertise big stipends/etc. for the situation they desire. So the castmates will probably be mid/late 20s to mid 30s, for it to be somewhat plausible. Otherwise again, the visuals of the older housemates will not agree with a lot of viewers. And then the inexperience/lack of accumulated wealth/etc. of the younger housemates will deter serious relationships or marriages.\n\nHold on, I overthinked this, lol. But ya, those are some possible scenarios for a more serious dating show.\n\nFor the duration of stay in the show, again 1 week is often said by the Money Catchers (from Love Catcher) as not enough. Then sometimes even in those 1 month or a few weeks shows it's also not enough. Maybe 2/3 months or so of stay is like the probable goldilocks, otherwise it'll take too much filming and editing time if they go for a long time, lol.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR: they gotta recruit/scout/etc. the good visuals to make the couples/marriages/et cetera more likely.",

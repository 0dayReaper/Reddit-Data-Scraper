    "postText": "source:https://www.soompi.com/article/1562651wpp/ravis-agency-releases-initial-statement-on-his-alleged-involvement-in-corruption-to-evade-military-service\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agency of VIXX\u2019s Ravi has released a statement regarding his ongoing allegations of military-related corruption.\n\nEarlier on January 12, it was reported that a group of brokers was arrested on charges of corruption to evade military service by designating their clients to a neurologist at a large hospital in Seoul and then giving them a false medical diagnosis of epilepsy to help them be exempted from military service or receive a lesser military grade.\n\nThe brokers had reportedly gone around promoting themselves by saying that a famous idol rapper had also used their service to successfully receive a Grade 4 (non-active duty) military assessment through them.\n\nThe reports claimed that the rapper had withdrawn from a variety show in May last year due to his military enlistment and then enlisted as a social service worker in October. Following this, Ravi, who stepped down from KBS2\u2019s \u201c2 Days &amp; 1 Night\u201d in May and started his military service as a public service worker in October, was named as the idol in question.\n\nRavi\u2019s agency GROOVL1N has since released an official statement as follows.\n\nHello.\n\nThis is GROOVL1N.\n\nWe would like to convey our official statement regarding the reports that came out today.\n\nAfter receiving the report, we are closely examining the truth about the situation.\n\nIt is only right to give a statement as quickly as possible, but since the problem is related to military duty, we think it is only appropriate to first find out the details and then give thorough explanations after, so we are currently trying to figure out the details. In addition, if there is a request for an investigation related to this case, [Ravi] will undergo it faithfully at any time.\n\nMore exact details will be provided in a separate notice at a later date.",

But for him it was because while he was serving the first time he continued to do some TV appearances and activities causing people to label him as someone neglecting his duties. So he had to serve again for a second time. According to my friends, for regular people one of the main reasons why they wouldn't want to serve if they didn't have to is because while in the military on active duty, you can't work and earn money. You can't use your cellphone (nowadays they allow it) and you basically live in a small room with a bunch of other men, no privacy, no private time, etc. And they literally pay you next to nothing when you're serving. So you better hope you have money saved up for your family. That's why men who are married get more time off and all that. \n\nIt isn't just the fact that celebrities purposely injure themselves to get exempted or to do public service. The netizens are also super brutal and will dig and dig for anything they can use to bring down someone so they can suffer like they did. Plus, celebrities make money so they don't even have to worry about what the average citizens have to worry about so that's why netizens especially men are much more cruel and criticize celebrities when it comes to the military. Like to this day people keep bringing up Kim Jong Kook when the man literally showed x-rays of his back and the military did multiple tests on him. He could've even been exempt without it because of his father's contributions to the military but KJK still served even though it was just public service. \n\nSome people just really want other people to suffer like they did. It's that mentality of because I did it, you should man up and do it too.",

Even IF he's innocent, his image already went rock bottom, Koreans are not playing lightly with military service. \n\nIdk what to think, I love him so much in 2D1N and hope for him to return after 2 years..if after investigation and they find out that he's really used the broker's service to lighten his military duties then I'm so disappointed with him. What a way to ruin your career by your own hands. He witnessed himself in 2D1N how tough it is once you have scandal or issues, it's stupid of him if all of this is true. I'm sorry this is not appropriate to say now but I'm thankful that this case doesn't directly impact 2D1N because Ravi left months ago. Jongmin teased Dindin jokingly few weeks ago about editing out problematic member from footages and we get this in the new year...\n\nI guess we need to wait for the investigation outcome, as they're in legal process now so for sure Groovl1n can't give out any statements.",

On top of that, these are young men who have been raised within the idol / entertainer system and don't have a lot of real-world experience outside of showbiz to inform their decision-making while reaching a stage in their career where they have more independence than they ever previously did. \n\nCompared to the relative lack of scandal on a show like Running Man with a set cast of already established talent who are middle aged and up, it seems drastic. But I think it makes more sense to compare 2Days to western reality shows or something like Terrace House where new faces are regularly cycling in - the amount of controversies is much more comparable there.\n\nAs for Ravi's situation, I think it's easy to see how an extremely career-minded (and extremely anxious) person would see something like this brokerage as a reasonable risk (or perhaps was persuaded that there was no risk at all - as another commenter pointed out, it's unlikely that Ravi was the first or only celebrity with a connection to this brokerage).",

Kim Seon Ho was a college grad, worked in theater and was older so he did have some real world experience.  Given Ravi is in his late 20s and VIXX is his agency, seems he should have known better.  I feel sorry for him if he did this because he has mental challenges and worried about the impact of military service on his health.  I don't think Korea recognizes mental health issues well.

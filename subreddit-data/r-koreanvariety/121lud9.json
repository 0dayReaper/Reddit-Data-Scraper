I think One Top could have used a Mijoo level male Idol to get them into peak dancing form the way she was constantly correcting Jinjoo during practice.\n* I'm jealous of the guy in the restaurant basically getting a free meal while watching *How Do You Play* live.\n* I loved the university outfits with the colored tights. They are so rare that the only other performance I could think of was [this awesome Chocome performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF9YNAz9qwE).\n* For 2 years I've thought Mijoo's loud 'yes' every time the group is ordered to do something was just Mijoo being Mijoo. I was recently watching something else and noticed the maknae there doing the same thing: loudly stating 'yes' at every order with the rest of the group going along but not vocal. Now I realize this must be a cultural thing I was previously unaware of.",

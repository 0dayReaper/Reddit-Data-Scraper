    "postText": "For K-Dating Shows fans, Netflix KR is kicking off the year with a new reality dating show heading our way this 2023! Personally, this show reminds me of Twinkle Love (Chinese Dating Show) and Real High School Romance (Korean Dating Show).\n\n**Hosted by:** **KYUHYUN (SJ)**, **Kim Ji-eun**, and **LEE SUHYUN (AKMU)**\n\n&gt;Netflix is launching a new reality program titled \u201c19/20\u201d which captures the growth and freedom of young 19-year-olds as they turn 20. In Korea, individuals are considered adults when they turn 20 by Korean reckoning, and everyone ages one year on New Year\u2019s Day as opposed to their birthday. The show will follow various Gen Z\u2019s as they enjoy their final week being 19 and their first week being 20 after ringing in 2023. \u201c19/20\u201d is produced by \u201cSingle\u2019s Inferno\u201d producing directors (PDs) Kim Jae Won and Kim Jung Hyun, as well as PD Park Soo Ji, and is written Ji Hyun Sook.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The unique participants will close out the year by spending time with their friends and slowly but surely preparing for adulthood. They will begin attending \u201c19 School\u201d where they will take lessons about useful things to know as an adult. On New Year\u2019s Day, all the cast members will part ways with their parents and teachers to move into the \u201c20 House,\u201d a place of independence and the start of their new adult journey.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After starting out the program in a familiar place like school, the cast will eventually end up in a new, independent space where they can showcase their colorful charms, create unexpected bonds, and make meaningful memories.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \u201c19/20\u201d began filming on Christmas Eve and the program will premiere worldwide via Netflix later this year. \n\nSource: [Soompi](https://www.soompi.com/article/1561519wpp/super-juniors-kyuhyun-kim-ji-eun-and-akmus-lee-suhyun-to-host-upcoming-reality-show-by-singles-inferno-pds?fbclid=IwAR1AEc-fc11ydFqAXxeuOmAwvBEn42-yjNrYMry9TLZngr95tk0UZyCe-hM), [1](http://enews.imbc.com/News/RetrieveNewsInfo/369702), [2](https://www.spotvnews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=577535), [3](https://www.fnnews.com/news/202301040940204601), [4](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm-OuXSvoyT/), [5](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm-OyvPPIzL/)",

            "comment": "This is actually wild, so many dating shows for 2022 and 2023. It may coincide with the upcoming **Heart Signal 4**. What if there was an accidental crossover, lol. But they probably filmed in different areas.\n\nKim Ji-eun's one of my favorite new actresses, her roles are so funny, lol. Wonder how she'll be as a panelist, as in if she'd be more reserved like Lee Da-hee in Single's Inferno or maybe allow herself to be more casual.\n\n---\n\nAnd yup, **Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81)** is one of the best shows for coming of age trips. Sorta like Terrace House: Boys &amp; Girls in the City youthfulness. Btw, a lot of the cast members from Terrace House are getting married now, time passes so fast.\n\nBasically for Twinkle Love they're university students that are having a field trip, lol. So they get missions, dates, et cetera.\n\nTwinkle Love has a lot of friendships formed in the show, you get to see bromances, sismances, etc.\n\nAs in it's one of the best shows for platonic friendships and all that, and you can see them shipping each other and so on, lmao. Like OMG (with NewJeans: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZAgIHmHLdc), they're so meta with Twinkle Love sometimes.\n\n**For Twinkle Love, at the end of each day they have to record a message for the person they liked/spent time the most with. And listen to their own message (through earbuds) IN FRONT OF EVERYONE, so it's kinda dramatic af, rofl.**\n\n**Twinkle Love Season 1 Episode 1**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxP-Ye9kr24\n\n**Twinkle Love Season 2 Episode 1 Part 1**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78vUkTAhuG8\n\nCheck the middle of this post for the playlists/etc. of Twinkle Love Season 1 and 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/102r1di/nineteen_to_twenty_korean_version_of/ \n\nBecause there's a lot of extra bonus content with Twinkle Love, no panelist versions of the episodes, livestream watch parties with the housemates, etc. Imagine if we all spoke Mandarin or like if Chinese characters were easily autotranslated. \n\nSo many good Chinese dating shows but they're under the radar despite being often free (though ya machine translated subs or no subs at all unless you visit their own YOUKU/iQIYI/Tencent Video/etc. website) on Youtube by the official companies or production shows.\n\nWish Viki and VIU and so on had huge budget and reach like Netflix. Picture a world like that for the dating/slice of life/et cetera shows.",

                            "comment": "For dating shows like Single's Inferno, there's quite a bit of them now.\n\nTry **Bed on the Beach**, Episode 1 from Jella\uc824\ub77c channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am-2tF_of5M\n\n**Sum+fing**. So this one is also tryna follow after Single's Inferno's footsteps. Episode 1 is actually fully subbed but then they were like nah, let's not sub the rest, lmao. This is Episode 1, you can actually kinda watch the other episodes through the same Youtube channel (\uc378\ud551 channel, the channel name has changed now to \u3147\u3148\u3147\u3131 : \uc624\ub298 \uc800\ub141 \uc608\ub2a5 \uace0?) but it's only short clips: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03ZlvSmoabo\n\nOr actually go with **Eden, Descendants of Instinct (\uc5d0\ub374)**. Eden 2 (\uc5d0\ub3742) is basically finished, so you can binge-watch both seasons. Think there was actually official subs for Season 1 now but it's somehow gone on Youtube, check the threads though for Eden: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/vd2n25/eden_e1_220614/\n\nEden (\uc5d0\ub374) also tried to be more provocative, but again still an East Asian dating show. Eden 2 (\uc5d0\ub3742) is easy to watch since it's on Viki. There's a girl there that really looks like Blackpink Jennie, it's wild.\n\nAnd Lana/\ub77c\ub098, a Russian Kpop idol is also in Eden 2.\n\n---\n\nIf you want legit people sleeping/interacting/etc. in the same bed in these East Asian dating shows, then there's **Sleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774)**, and Eden, Descendants of Instinct (\uc5d0\ub374). Oh and there's also **Chain Reaction (\uccb4\uc778\ub9ac\uc561\uc158)** where they get chained together, lol.\n\nIn Sleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774) there's hilarious af scenes due to some cast members, like it's actually crazy how unexpectedly funny the show was. It starts off with gloomy rainy weather but ya imagine if they had better filming conditions and production, it would've been maybe way better.\n\nSleeping Only Relationship is easy to recommend as this time they actually legit sleep together in the same bed, but it's still an East Asian dating show though. It's not what you think despite the title and premise. Try to watch until Episode 2 and 3, this show is ridiculous af. You'll likely be howling with the panelists, from laughter and shock, like rofl.\n\n**For Sleeping Only Relationship they have \"unrestricted\" time from 6PM to 6AM, so that includes their dates at restaurants, etc. Usually they end up sleeping around 12/1AM, etc. and then they have to be ready by ~7/8AM.**\n\nSleeping Only Relationship doesn't have an official English sub. But it does have a fan sub right now from iheartu2 (from Youtube and Twitter), check their Twitter and Youtube pages for more info, they're also subbing Chain Reaction. There's actually machine-translated subs right now for the rest of Sleeping Only Relationship and Chain Reaction but they often skip dialogue.\n\n---\n\nThere's actually other dating shows on Youtube now too from different countries/et cetera. \n\nThese are Malaysian-Chinese/Singaporean/etc. dating shows, **Play Safe Play Me**, **One Week Love**, and **Dui Ni You Gan Jue**, check here: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yyjiu2/love_catcher_in_bali_e01_221118/iwvbxrm/\n\nPlay Safe Play Me (from the Leeroy Wong channel), was marketed/titled as a Malaysian version of Single's Inferno but it's actually really different and somewhat chill.  \n\nPlay Safe Play Me, Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt665qFsW3s\n\n---\n\n**Japan actually has this show called Shuffle Island**, lol. Check the ABEMA Youtube channel (Heart Signal Japan is also here), this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsxjM2uB8S4. \n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and more info on where to watch them: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zyn2y0/regarding_the_popularity_of_the_different_dating/j2a8bok/**\n\n---\n\n**This thread has the different names of streaming/OTT services (like TVING, Coupang Play, wavve, etc.) or websites and the various Youtube channels and links for where to watch some of these dating shows**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yktjg9/can_anyone_suggest_some_kdating_shows/iuvbg43/\n\nFor more comments/overview/etc. on East Asian dating shows, check these threads: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iyso9ql/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iz8ayph/\n\nCheck here for where to watch other dating shows with VPN/et cetera: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zywb4f/transit_love_2_post_show_content/j28kqn3/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/\n\nMore info on resources or where to watch the East Asian dating shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zlml4b/ramyun_chill_episode_5_finale_221214/j06e2lh/\n\n---\n\n**Check MyDramaList too for a more visual list of these dating shows**.

If it gets the green light, it will stream at the end of next year. This is to give the production team more time to prepare. The shooting will also be in the 2nd half of the year as compared to the previous season, which was shot in May (1st Half of the Year).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Source: [1](https://www.gukjenews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=2588779), [2](https://news.koreadaily.com/2022/11/08/sports/broadcast/20221108205623629.html)\n\nAs of the latest [reports](https://www.donga.com/news/Entertainment/article/all/20230102/117252752/1), it is now ***confirmed*** by TVING that there will be a **Transit Love 3** later this year.

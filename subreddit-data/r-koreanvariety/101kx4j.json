I\u2019ve really fallen in love with the direction RM has taken with this concept and I\u2019ve heard that this is something that 2D1N does a lot. Does anyone have any episode recommendations for 2 Days 1 Night that a newbie like me can start with? Thanks in advance!",

(The season 2 playlist currently starts at the exact point where it began to suuuuuuuck.) \n\nThere's already some solid S3 recommendations, so I'll skip those.\n\nBoth Kocowa and Viki have the entirety of S4 available in North America- obviously I'm assuming, so I'm sorry if I don't have your correct location. \n\nThe last two episodes of S4 are also good intros because there's a new member and there's plenty of local interaction.",

My top best pick would be Countryside special, Seoul university special, teacher special, student(?) special, Seollal in Seoul, quit smoking project, and the one where they had Han hyojoo as a guest. Season 3 is my personal favorite and they had done lots of missions with the public too. For new viewers maybe you can start with S4 which brings different sentiment compared to the previous 2d1n but they hadn't done lots of missions with the public due to covid.",

They give advice to students and have to cast and put on an impromptu busking show. It was wholesome, entertaining, and dramatic. It was a refreshing surprise.",

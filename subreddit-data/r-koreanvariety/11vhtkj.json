If u look across most streaming platform, running man still the highest watched variety program every year. I dont even remember when the last time i watch tv, maybe like 10 years ago.",

I mean the weekly episode guide on RM sub is quite old and doesn't add any value. I am sure no one even pays attention to it. \n\nHere in this sub you add a really good and concise weekly guide post for RM. Why don't you replicate the same on the RM sub as well? I have sent messages in the past to mods of RM sub but no reply or any action taken by mods for RM. \n\nI mean literally the weekly guide on RM sub is useless but still it is there every week. You can remote the torrent links and paste the same content to RM sub as well. Kindly let me know on this. Thank you.",

Angellove wasn't responsible for updating the weekly episode guide **list**, I was. When I quit being a mod, the list was updated for a few weeks, then I noticed it stopped. Might be that they dropped it after I left; I can't give you a definitive answer as to why as I'm no longer a mod there, but my guess is they have different priorities. As such, its use is only relevant up until the last episode added into the list and not for newer ones.\n\nThe episode guide **posts** serves the purpose containing episode discussion within it - for various reasons: one being to avoid spoilers from spreading too much. Another was because it was actually requested we, at the time, have a dedicated post for the new episode discussions, which the episode guide posts weren't quite before the request was made, so it was the logical step to make them just that. Granted now the list is growing less relevant for each new episode, but the posts are hardly useless as a whole.\n\nAbout torrents: When I was a mod I was told they don't add or allow torrent info as it was decided they didn't want to take the risk of dealing with potential legal repercussions. If you still think it's a good idea you should pursue it with the top mod (top of the mod list) as I believe they're the most active one.\n\nEdit: saw that angellove did make a comment for the torrent in the episode guide post, linking people to this post which is, I suppose indirect enough, so that might be allowed.",

I was expecting a reply for the OP but it's ok at least you explained the things which run behind the scene. \n\nI hardly see any mods interaction in the sub. In the past, the sub was very active with Predictions, but now there is nothing. I might be wrong but I also didn't see you much in the last couple of months. I hope everything is alright. I wish there should be some level of responsibility from the mods side. Anyway thanks again \u2764\ufe0f.",

I'm still active on the sub and do see you around! Might be that there aren't many as active as I was left on the mod team. Might be something to inquire about with the top mod. See you around!\ud83d\ude42",

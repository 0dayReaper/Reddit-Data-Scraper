    "postText": "Didn't think I had to make this post but whatever. First, if you've never watched Sixth Sense or don't know the cast's chemistry, please watch some clips from the show beforehand. \n\nHere's the video for reference: https://twitter.com/yoo720814_/status/1517470905240555520?t=P5Ftnt_NelGZZDZPiF1oPQ&amp;s=19\n\nSo K-netizens, especially men and older, conservative women, are making a big fuss about Jessi and Mijoo talking about their periods on Sixth Sense. They also think Mijoo asking Jaesuk if she had her period last month is an insult to his family, wife, and the whole country \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude36\ud83d\ude44 If you watch Sixth Sense, you'll understand that the female cast members' main job is to drive Jaesuk insane (in a funny/variety way). It's like high school teenagers driving their male teacher crazy with their antics. They're really comfortable with Jaesuk and talking about their period seems VERY mellow compared to what they said/did beforehand. They  made a lot of rated r jokes before like doing chest bumps (Jaesuk saying he cant do chest bump with Jessi), talking about their chest size, freezing their eggs, and more rated r moments during games. So I really don't understand how this became such a big controversy. Also the articles written about this do not accurately describe the joke   and misrepresents Mijoo and Jessi. It's like a witch hunt for quick clicks/views and outrage. I totally understand why we call them \uae30\ub808\uae30 (trash reporters). \n\nAlso, can we please normalize talking about menstruation on variety shows? It's nothing out of the ordinary and it's something most women experience every month. People who sexualize periods and putting a stigma on it are the true villains in this story. \n\nPlease view variety as variety and not equate it to IRL situations. I can't take people - who view variety shows as a documentary - seriously.",

My respect for him went through the roof after I heard about that. You know he\u2019s a great guy, and an excellent father to his daughter, when he does something classy like that. No wonder the women on **Sixth Sense** treat him like their adopted dad \u2014 which includes joking about their periods.",

Some of the things these people come up with are so ridiculous it's funny.\n\nEven though Sixth Sense as a whole is a very unconventional show compared to others (given broadcasting regulations), I think this grossly unfair reaction to such a normal conversation that should never be stigmatised has a lot to do with the political situation there right now. I'm definitely not the most knowledgeable about it, but I think the recent election of Yoon has made his supporters (particularly the very conservative, traditional ones) feel empowered in some ways. Reporters and the way that they write things will also be affected by where the company they work for stands on the political spectrum (as most news is, unfortunately).\n\nI'm so glad Antenna is standing up for Mijoo, and bless her for bringing the topic up. I truly hope she knows she's supported and that she didn't do anything wrong.",

The story was so ridiculous even if they were exaggerating it. The guy fought with his girlfriend, didn\u2019t call her for 12 days, came back to Korea to find that she was partying with colleagues who happened to be of both the genders, go so mad that he threatened his girlfriend and she left the party early so that nobody gets into fist fight, married her in a hurry while still questioning her faithfulness to him, held onto the grudge for years and finally confronted the other guy in a variety show. Even if it was scripted, I think this was really disrespectful towards his wife to say the least and also showed how controlling the guys are in their relationships and how much normalised this is.",

I also think there is a certain freedom people can get once they\u2019ve married or have committed to someone where everyone knows the line and they can become friends knowing that it will never happen. Also even if it does happen, if someone was able to breakup a marriage, I really don\u2019t think that marriage was worth saving if its that easy to break. \n\nTrying to prohibit an S.O. From interacting with the opposite sex is ridiculous. If you are doing your job as a partner they would never put theirself in a situation that could breakup your relationship. I also think its one thing to express your jealousy so your partner knows that their actions hurt your feelings, but its completely insane to try and force rules onto your partner of how they should act.",

Won't add it here but some of the comments about this issue have been outright disgusting. At least there have been mostly positive comments as well but it really tells you how drastically different views can be within different Korean communities. One very unfortunate thing from all this is I feel like it will discourage them to talk about menstruation again, even when there is literally no reason to not talk about it. Also to me, it shows the importance of programs like Sixth Sense. Tons of female writers in variety and Korean entertainment, and it's important to have women in shows as well.",

Maybe it\u2019s because for the most of the show it was Jessi making more explicit jokes or openly talking about her period and I have a feeling that because she\u2019s American and because of her persona, it\u2019s seen as more acceptable compared to Mijoo, a former girl group member born in Korea.  I just hope this doesn\u2019t discourage the girls from making more jokes like this, these jokes are basically the foundation for the show\u2026\n\nWith the recent election of Yoon, I believe we\u2019ll see more moments like these pop up. And I also believe that female comedians and personalities are tired and starting to push back against a lot of the norms and will continue to do increasingly more for the next couple of years. \n\nEdit: Ever since Jessi has popped up on the variety circuit, she\u2019s been breaking ground in terms of what is considered acceptable conversation, alongside Narae and Somin beforehand and now Mijoo. I\u2019m genuinely so proud of these women for talking about such things openly and surviving in this industry. I\u2019m also thankful for male comedians like YJS and PDs like Chulmin for giving these women a platform like Sixth Sense as well. Like I mentioned on the Yoo Quiz discussion, i feel like we\u2019ll see PDs and personalities take more openly political stances in the years to come if Yoon continues to stir mess in the entertainment business.",

Like women have periods. That's what they do, they have periods until they reach menopause. There's no need to act like Carrie's mom or anything.

It's really part of natural condition/happening so it should not be receiving a backlash for being mentioned anywhere including public TV!\n\nHowever as a wife/gf, I might find it upsetting if a female colleague/friend is asking my husband/bf about her fertility cycle (to some people, period= fertility = pregnancy = sex, and I think this is the part that cause the controversy?). The intimate question asking if YJS remembers whether she has period last month sounds like the conversation of unwed/unready couple trying to avoid the pregnancy or married/ready couple trying to conceive. This is one/part of the real/raw conversation that couple discuss about period.\n\nOf course, I want to believe there are nothing between them and it's all for jokes and all. However just want to share why some people might find only the last part of the clip slightly thoughtless. And not exactly because of period/menstruation as a taboo concept.",

Not stating a different opinion. \n\nTo your point: I see how some people might find it odd - especially K-netizens. However, what's most important is: Is Yoo Jaesuk uncomfortable by Mijoo making these comments? The answer is No. Do we know how his wife feels about this? No. I think the fake outrage from people pretending to be Yoo Jaesuk's wife is quite ridiculous. If the people who are involved are okay with it - who are we to say how they should react and say. Mijoo and Jaesuk have a father-daughter relationship and it's quite evident. I think people are trying to twist this pure relationship into something that is not. \n\nI personally talk about my period to my male friends and brother even though I have a BF. I am comfortable with this and my BF knows periods are normal and nothing sexual. I see it no differently than peeing or pooping. \n\nLastly, this is a variety show. Things are not meant to be taken seriously, especially a show like Sixth Sense. If things like Jaesuk saying he cant do chest bumps with Jessi, female cast members babying Jaesuk, and talking freely about sex in front of Jaesuk is okay then I see why this is controversial and the others are not. Wouldn't you equally be upset if your bf/husband was getting these treatments and hearing these things? I think the main problem here is the selective outrage and making Mijoo the scapegoat to hate on both Jaesuk (he's been getting a lot of hate b/c Yoo Quiz) and Mijoo (a successful, empowered women incels hate). \n\nI also hope you're not implying that Mijoo and Jaesuk are having an affair by your last paragraph. \"Nothing between them (????)\" That's straight up defamation.",

They were (from how I read it) just clarifying that even in familial-like/friendly bonds - there are still some boundaries to be observed. Boundaries are not there to necessarily imply anything has happened, but to safeguard from it. At the end of the day, while LMJ or Jessi or Somin are very much like younger siblings to YJS, they are not. So while conversation about periods and mensuration as a whole should be normalized in a general sense - I do agree with the poster that the the part that did bring some personal discomfort was LMJ turning to YJS for confirmation about the frequency, etc. which as the OP pointed out - would be a conversation I\u2019d personally reserve for my partner or SO. Again, I\u2019m not implying impropriety on their part, but merely saying there is an understandable discomfort from some viewers. This doesn\u2019t mean anyone isn\u2019t being open minded or not progressive or even misogynistic as some have implied in this thread, I think it just comes down to comfort level and what some might find to be important safeguard boundaries to be observed amongst single women and a married man (or even if it was the other way around - a married woman and her single men friends) regardless of how close or familiar they might be.",

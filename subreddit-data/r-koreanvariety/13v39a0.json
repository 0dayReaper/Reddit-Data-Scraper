    "postText": "One thing that is a positive input is how Lee Seung Gi is pretty impressive in his Japanese, even though his way of talking stutters a bit.\n\n  \nI think the average time of 1 ramyun is around 2/3 min. That's why it takes a lot of time at the beginning of the episode.\n\n&gt;!\nIt's a shame that two ramyun have been removed, but if they cannot be removed, how can we see other types of ramyun in the next episode?!&lt;",

It has Jinny's Kitchen vibes, anyone who likes Jinny's Kitchen would like this show. \n\nAll the ramyun looks delicious, especially the seafood one. Poor In Hyuk is so nervous, it's really hard esp when he doesn't speak Japanese. They shld have guest stars to help him out. They need someone to help lift the mood, like a Wooshik or a DinDin type of character, esp when Hodong is stressed in the kitchen. Poor guy looked completely exhausted by the time the restaurant closed. \n\nIt was quite funny seeing Seunggi freeze up while he was trying to figure out how to prepare the three orders. Not sure why he decided to prepare one first and then two, I would've prepared two servings first then one more so that the orders would be ready faster.",

            "comment": "i am enjoying the show so far. really nice to see the hodong-seunggi combo again. watching both their shows now. but at least with this show we get to see more of their relationship compared to strong heart. just realised this is a tv chosun show. usually the varieties show from there are not officially subbed. \n\ni like that the shop is small enough that they can see the customers while cooking. i'm a fan of cooking shows, esp when they travel overseas. very interesting to see how seunggi has evolved in cooking. still remembering his cooking on 2d1n lol. very enthusiastic and follow recipe to a T. but always lacking something lol. when he said you have also need to have the feel in Ep 1, definitely a diff person haha.\n\nliking the challenge of not having a \"can improve better\" for their dishes to ensure they are getting a variety of ramyun out. they really look good though",

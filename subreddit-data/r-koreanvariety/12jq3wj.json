    "postText": "'Peak Time' is a brand-new idol competition program in which teams battle for the chance to become the next worldwide idol group. Unlike other audition programs, its contestants consist entirely of male idols who have already debuted, whether currently active or part of a disbanded group.\n\nOnly the top 6 finalists would be able to reveal their group name on the show, and those 6 teams would be participating in a \u201cPeak Time\u201d concert tour. The final winner will receive a grand prize of 300 million won (approximately $232,932), as well as the opportunity to release a new album and hold a global showcase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Second Global Vote Results**\n\nThe rankings were based on the second global vote, which came to an end on April 6 at 9:00 A.M. KST, plus the benefit that was awarded to the winners of the last round. Only the top six teams will be advancing to the finals. The top 6 finalists would be able to reveal their group name on the show and would be participating in a \u201cPeak Time\u201d concert tour.\n\n1. &gt;!11:00 (VANNER) with 3% total votes benefit from winning the Originals Match Round!&lt;\n2. &gt;!7:00 (MASC)!&lt;\n3. &gt;!8:00 (DKB) with 3% total votes benefit from winning the Originals Match Round!&lt;\n4. &gt;!24:00 (SOLOISTS)!&lt;\n5. &gt;!13:00 (BAE173)!&lt;\n6. &gt;!20:00 (M.O.N.T)!&lt;\n\n* The eliminated teams are: &gt;!2:00 (NTX), 14:00 (GHOST9), 15:00 (BLK), and DGNA (23:00)!&lt;.\n* ['Peak Time' Ranking History](https://www.mykpopshows.com/peak-time-global-voting-results)",

I guarantee Team 23 would have still been in the top 3.",

I do have to give the show credit for actually letting them say something because I\u2019m used to shows just editing out people and pretending they were never there. \n\nI also found out that team 20:00 originally has 3 members and the member that isn\u2019t participating has released music previously with Jay from Boys Planet? Idk just random fun thing I came across. \n\nVery much going to miss NTX and Ghost9.",

They've been playing this whole \"poor part-time worker\" concept even before peak time and to be quite honest almost every underground idol has had to work part-time jobs to sustain themselves if they haven't abandoned their dreams as full-grown adults. When the show finishes I really hope they re-establish their image.",

It was so cool to see some of the old members of the show and it's really sweet that Park Seul Gi was at the World Cup viewing party with Manager Ha Seok-ju. Man, what I would give to have had Song Sohee there with the WW girls, watching and reacting to the game. Bummer. Miss you bae. Lol. \n\nGod, the reactions from everyone when the two coaches came out was worth the 2 hours of viewing right off the bat. \"Wow, the production crew are super competent at their jobs!\" lmao. \"Do you know chicken...?\" lmao. Seogi being mind blown to see Figo even at 21 just shows how big a football fan she is. Can't imagine how she reacted watching this episode and seeing both coaches call her their favorite and number one desired pick for their team.\n\nThe quality of most of the match wasn't all THAT much higher the best quality matches the show has had which is nice. The ladies weren't out there getting embarrassed. The quality of play seen here has gotta be the dream for the show. Though that dream is made much tougher by the ever losing of players and having to replace them with new additions. It's wild by the way that the cast member with the best cardio endurance was by far the oldest, Sun Young.",

The passing this week is so much better due to the higher skill level by the local players. And even the when the ball did go out of bounds, the play resumed quickly when it was to the offenses advantage - instead of Shooting Stars normal long drawn out set peices that result in yet another ball out of bounds.\nAnd the goalkeeping was completely lopsided when you compare Neves to Ayumi. Mixing up the team was the only way they could field some semblance of a competitive match.",

                            "comment": "Okay so as the game went on, especially after the half that became more clear. But tbf I'll state two things: \n\n1. The players from the show playing were absolutely no where near the best the show had to offer. Seogi yes though I think playing on real grass really impacted her game and Sun Young who played really well but clearly doesn't have their level of techniques. But if you bring the actual best players from the show think things would be surprisingly not massively different. Different by quite a bit, but not massively. \n2. The best matches the show has ever had have had this type of play where the ball rarely went out of bounds, there was a lot of passing, there was good dribbling and buildup and there was good shots on the goal. Not with the Portuguese level of ball skills but I found them to be highly watchable and enjoyable like this match. \n\nSo yeah, really the key part of my comment are\n\n&gt;The quality of most of the match wasn't all **THAT** much higher the **best quality matches the show has had** which is nice.\n\nClearly the young women who have 10 years experience and play amateur or semi pro soccer are much better than even the best members of the show but on that small of a field only so much can be done and the best members of the show (the true All Star team) are at the point where I think they could score some goals and with the shows best goalie not give up as much as Ayumi gave up. \n\nI wish fairly often that Shooting Stars veered off course and went the 'Gentlemans League\" route. Picking the best players from the show and playing them against amateur teams in order to develop their skills and then have them play in an amateur tourney or something. I love the show as it is but I think the skill level of football we watch won't get much better cause eventually players will leave as others have and because the show is about parity and an unwritten rule (they sometimes break) is that new members have little to no soccer experience, it keeps teams from playing at a quality level for like a year.",

The Portuguese player with 10 years playing experience showed them the total play of every players on the team. The vision to see the whole field and the calmness to develop a play. Also they got to see how a goalkeeper need to develop their ball handling skills so they can be the 5th attacking players when needed. And of course, maintaining their fitness for the whole game. Understandable that it was a 30 minutes half, but if they can play 30 minutes half that was fairly fast paced, they can definitely handle the 10 minutes half. \nNot sure when is Women's World Cup, but if they can incorporate that into the show, it will such a good collaboration if the main goal is to introducing the sport to the whole country.",

Ahhh ok yeah i think that's more fair for them to be mixed together. Hopefully they'll learn a lot! \n\nThe team with the 3 portuguese players also got SY and SG - it's looking pretty lopsided (esp bc the portuguese goalie is like a 6th player lol) \n\nSo happy for Seung Hye tho!!! \n\nExcited to finalllyyyyy get back to the league games even tho this last ep was pretty fun.

Retired players know some of the current players personally, and they compare their past performances to the ones of current players.

And in a close  environment with a couple of soft touch, inexperienced youngsters, I know who is going to be enjoying the experience the most.\n\nThe lack of relationship experience of some of these guys is jaw dropping. To think you can single out 1 person based on first impressions,  and expect that they could immediately reciprocate the same feelings is so naiive. And if that's your only approach, then you may as well not be there.\n\nFrom a viewer perspective, it's a lot more interesting to see the contestants getting to know several potential partners. That's where the element of competition really spices thimgs up.",

I can see why so many girls are interested: he's mysterious, charming, and has a funny awkward and cute side. I like that he didn't push/pressure Seulki into doing things during the date and I like that he respected all her choices, and I think that's what made her feel comfortable enough to swim with him and hold his fingers while swimming- such a cute scene, he was so smooth. I cracked up when he bumped into the mirror, when he had seulki carry her own luggage going back while the other 2 guys carried their date's luggage, when he was focused on fanning the fire while seulki went out with 2 other guys to get water, and when he had 4 girls surrounding him talking to him. Something about him not trying hard like the other guys makes him more charming. Don't get me wrong, I think he's still the bad boy type who may not be the best for long-term relationships, but I think he's the perfect guy for a short dating show like this.",

Literal laugh-cry emoji moment for me too! \n\nPainfully hilarious, as if they were showing the parallel universes despite them being in the same space. \n\nWe have Hanbin and So-e talking about how they are gonna give their love interest another shot! But unbeknownst to them, Yoongjae and Seo-eun were practically confessing to each other and so into each other!\n\nReally rooting for Yoongjae and Seoeun just because of their palpable chemistry. And as much as I didn\u2019t like So-E\u2019s full on style of confession. I think she handled the last conversation maturely and deserve better than pining for someone who won\u2019t return the interest.",

It was nice to see someone willing to accommodate and Seulki letting him know he didn't have to do that was also considerate of her. \n- JY bumping into the mirror, somehow I'm growing incredibly fond of him LOLL\n- So-EUN and Han-Bin's date looked so fun! It's nice they added an additional activity for them in paradise this time\n- Han-Bin has won a grand prize in a chef's competition!? He's got serious skills\n- So-EUN is very considerate! Explaining why she went to Inferno with Han-Bin shows she can empathize very well and takes this seriously. I feel the age gap will throw her off.\n- The English conversation between DW and Nadine is hilarious what are they doing loll\n- Sweet Nadine awww, I guess her switching to English was really due to her nerves. I'm sad she felt she didn't belong there at first, good for DW for including her in the beginning!\n- The panel about to faint for Nadine's school they're so funny!!! Nadine is that girl!\n- I get the reason DW and Nadine won't work is honestly because of distance. He's looking for something long term and stable\u2014which Nadine's career path is not easy and she wouldn't be in the same continent 75% of the time. \n- Something I noticed was how DW was noticeably more \"respectful\" in talking to Nadine and not asking her if she had feelings for him or if she wanted to come back to paradise with him again. I guess he was more attracted to Seulki and said whatever came to his mind but interesting observation on his dating style\n- Seulki is so down bad for this man I love it!! She really broke him down lmao the panelists yelling in victory was so funny\n- JY and Seulki's date was very cute, at some points I was covering my eyes because the physical tension was crazy. They're so unserious \n- One thing I've noticed is that Seulki has kept to her initial stances throughout the dates. The difference was how the other person responded to it. She said she didn't mind splashing with DW and she said she could watch JY in the water. DW is the one who said they shouldn't go into the pool in the end and JY went ahead and made her feel okay going in the water.\n- Does YJ regret not choosing SO-E after SO-EUN went with HanBin? I don't know if I like that...\n\n\nHear some more on r/netflixsinglesinferno",

I doubt Jungwoo would be as pushy as Dongwoo was, but maybe Seulki doesn\u2019t want to be further pressured/burdened by someone who already has intense feelings for her when they don\u2019t even know the key essential facts about her yet.",

A girl crush!\u2019 what he actually meant is that \u2018yeah she\u2019s pretty and all the girls probably love her but not me and not us men\u2019. This is probably why Sejeong seem to tone her girl crush aura in recent episode. Her make up is softer now. \n\nAnd yeah the guys and girls this season are all stubborn. They stick to their first choices but then now that both Dongwoo &amp; SooE got rejected in Ep. 6, maybe they\u2019ll move on to someone else next episode. It seem the new war is Jinyoung-Seulki-Jongwoo and Soeun-Youngjae-NewGirl. \n\nNadine seem interested to Jinyoung and he seem indulgent but you can tell his choice is still Seulki. He literally ask where she is during their beach hangout and also the only girl he initiated solo talk with. W/ Nadine she is the one who invited him.",

But she's really beautiful which puts her over the top.\n\nAnd I think ppl are shy about changing feeling also because they might get trashed online.\n\nImagine a guy really liked someone the views like such as Nadine, and then changed his mind.

I believe she drifts towards guys like him that treats her equally without pressure as it gives a sense of confidence to feel independent. I was nervous about nonchalant personality but he seems to have his eyes on her too. He still most likely will talk to the other girls out of curiosity but I believe he already made his mind up the moment he saw her. Also the way to both confessed to trying to act neutral about the dates from the other contestants was funny! Really shows they want to keep that intimate moment personal to prevent other from being curious about their date. So cute and I\u2019m rooting for them!\n\nAlso I know they have a to restrict footage due to time but it\u2019s a little sad that we miss certain conversations like Nadine and Jong Woo (I think that was him?) in the little dome infront when Jinyoung and Seul ki were talking over beer. I wanna see other convos even if they they are \u201cpointless\u201d just to get to know them all better. \n\nI always feel bad for new contestants especially late since they always feel out of place\u2026",

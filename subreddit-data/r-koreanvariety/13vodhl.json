    "postText": "Does anyone know where I can find English subtitles for the show My Friends Are Smarter Than Me? The show is hosted by Jun Hyun Moo and started airing in January 2023. I'm not sure if this is the Korean title: \ub0b4 \uce5c\uad6c\ub4e4\uc740 \ub098\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub611\ub611\ud558\ub2e4. \n\nI found it while I was searching for Blood Game 2 related videos. One of the Blood Game cast, Xitsuh, was a guest. Here is the show for reference: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VpM\\_QCqDUc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VpM_QCqDUc)",

            "comment": "It wasn't a great show so you're honestly not missing out on much. The main cast were picked for their dumbness or simplicity. The guests invited was very hit and miss. The problems themselves were made pretty difficult in order to encourage bringing smarter guests. Some problems required knowledge of Chinese lettering, advanced math, or pattern recognition. There was no build-up or high prize money.",

What I like about that show is they tell you straight up that the show is scripted and they show the viewers what the script is. In a way this makes the show feel less scripted because the cast have to hold back their real emotions to follow the script and the viewers are shown that they feel bad for following the script. The show masterfully manipulates the people into falling in love with eachother.",

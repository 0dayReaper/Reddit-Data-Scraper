Are there similar sites/apps where I can watch shows like House on Wheels and I Live Alone?\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: I appreciate the suggestions! Thank you all!",

            "comment": "Try using a VPN set to Southeast Asia for VIU/etc.\n\nYou'll have to use a VPN to access region-restricted content (this is mainly with VIU, Netflix, Disney+, etc.). These days some streaming services will not allow free and/or paid VPNs to access their content, so definitely do a lot of research if you want to use it for say Netflix and other sites.\n\nA lot of fansubs (or official subs) get uploaded/ripped later on the usual streaming sites too, so the option is there too.\n\nLook into StackSocial/etc. deals/coupons/sales/et cetera for VPNs, especially if you want to watch (East) Asian content through the various streaming/OTT/etc. services. Windscribe (/r/Windscribe) in particular is often cheap still, IIRC, but the speed/bandwitdth might not be the best, check their subreddit for more up to date info.\n\nSome more info on Windscribe VPN: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yyjiu2/love_catcher_in_bali_e01_221118/iwzq9tp/\n\nCheck this thread too for other sites/et cetera: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/\n\nThat thread link above is mainly for Korean/Chinese/etc. dating shows (https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zlml4b/ramyun_chill_episode_5_finale_221214/j06e2lh/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/znemtw/i_fell_in_love_with_korean_dating_shows/j0h5xw3/) but it applies to other more regular Korean variety shows too.",

I pay around \u00a39.49 per month through Google play and PayPal. I mainly watch I live alone, return of superman and mums diary. You can also get Running man and a few others. I also use k123.tv I would also use vpn on this site to block pop-up ads. Hope this helps.",

The trailer too had them all dressed up, I hope they figured out how to make that whole memory thing a bit more interesting. \n\nThis isn\u2019t specific to only this episode but an issue I\u2019ve noticed is that Jinjoo\u2019s character kind of overlaps too much with Mijoo. The idol concept/dancing, singing, bad at quizzes, being unfit, etc\u2026I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an unpopular opinion.\n\nAlso does anyone else find it ridiculous that you have the chance of receiving the PD\u2019s photocard if you order the calendar \ud83d\udc80",

Yikyung is fitting in fine and has his own thing going on, but I hope Jinjoo finds her own different character. Admittedly I am a bit biased though since I didn't find Jinjoo that funny during the WSG arc and enjoy Mijoo the most in the cast.",

If they were set on adding another female member they should've gone for someone to fill more of an ace role like SJH's in the earlier days of RM (e.g. smart/witty or athletic/coordinated). I think someone younger than Mijoo would've also given them a lot more to work with since Mijoo has enough variety sense to play up the seniority bit.",

            "comment": "I used to be a BIG fan of this show. But not anymore.. Why?\n\nBecause of none other than the PD!\n\n   A. He is a narcissist. In what universe does he think the show would be better if we see his face? The only funny moment about him was when Jaesuk said people stopped bashing the PD after they saw how pitiful he looked. He should\u2019ve just stopped there. I also felt pity at first lol but not after i\u2019m forced to see his face every episode.\n\n   B. Lackluster/ boring ideas/themes/ uncoordination-Beggar costume? For what? In some episodes, you can tell even Jae Suk is astounded by the lack of coordination.. like not cooperating with the manager to make sure yi kyung can answer the door in the morning.\n\n   C. Editing/managing events - example: MSG wannabe was wwaaaayyy waaaayyy better than WSG wannabe! I actually felt sorry for the girls - because they weren\u2019t given enough respect/importance and screen time. Everything was swept though very quickly, without entertainment value. You dont see their groups recording on the studio with Jae Suk giving commentaries and other tidbits of rehearsals. They probably practiced at least a week for those dance moves but only showed us 2 minutes of that performance.\n\n   D. Bad group dynamic - Like what everyone is saying, they all just dont fit together right. Personally, I would\u2019ve preferred if Jaesuk was the only one in the show again-which I know is no fun for him, but very fun for the audience. Even the judges from WSG wannabe are not entertaining at all - which I get, they are not all comedians-BuT still, made it really not fun to watch. Jinjoo is funny with her idol skit but does not know yet how to support other\u2019s comedy lines and has a tendency to put others down. Regardless, notice that when the group is together, they are only 10% funny and 90% complaining about each other and everything else. In the end, most of them are only funny when Jaesuk is around to make fun of them or give them ideas how to be funny. When they have individual or paired tasks/screen time without jaesuk- entertainment value goes down the drain. So yes, I prefer them to just cast Jaesuk again lol\n\n   E. I hate these senseless skits. Some skits are funny when done in small amounts. But even then - the only funny moments are when they break character. What\u2019s so funny about pretending to be an employee in a company? Just stop giving them a script already. You can give them a character to use, but cut it short before it gets boring.\n\n   In summary, this show isnt as entertaining anymore. I love Jaesuk and for me is the only redeeming factor here. I wish they replace the PD faaaast!!!",

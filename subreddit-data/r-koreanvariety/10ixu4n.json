    "postText": "**Description**\n\n&gt;The cast and guests play games to win and enjoy different foods from a featured outdoor market in Korea. The main game consists of listening to a song and determining the correct lyrics for a part of it while employing different hints to get closer to the solution. Every failed attempt means more food for YouTube mukbang star Small-mouthed Haetnim. During Snack Time a different game each week determines who gets to try a snack representing this week's market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Host**\n\n* Boom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Shin Dong-yeop\n* Kim Dong-hyun\n* Moon Se-yoon\n* Park Narae\n* Hanhae\n* Key\n* Nucksal\n* Taeyeon\n* Haetnim\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Guests**\n\n* Im Soo Hyang\n* Cha Chung Hwa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**One Shots**\n\n|Member|2023|Overall|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Key|0|94|\n|Seyoon|0|76|\n|Hanhae|0 + 1|56 + 1|\n|P.O\\*|0|56|\n|Hyeri\\*|0|49|\n|Nucksal|0|46|\n|Narae|0|38|\n|Taeyeon|0|20|\n|Shin Dongyeob|0 + 1|15 + 1|\n|Donghyun|0|15|\n|Haetnim|0|1|\n\n\\*\\*updated based on Wiki'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Subtitles**\n\n|**Stream**|Link|\n|:-|:-|\n|Streaming site|[Viu](https://www.viu.com/ott/ph/en-us/vod/2060619/Amazing-Saturday-2023)|\n\n**Source**\n\n\\*Viu\n\n^(\\*you can still support @/dareumi from all the subtitle works they had done for the community by donating through -)  [^(ko-fi.com/dareumi)](https://ko-fi.com/dareumi) \\+",

I think it was a shame that no one insisted about the &gt;! \ub354 !&lt; in the first round. but that\u2019s probably because only Narae heard it so she just brushed it off. she did quite well in the first dictation and even contributed the word &gt;! \uae30\ub984 !&lt; . and when they succeed it seems that no one remembers she talked about the &gt;! \ub354 !&lt; :(",

She's hands down the best guest in the history of the show in terms of skills....and this show would really do well with another top lyrics guesser.\n\nThen again, if they had two top tier guessers, it might be too easy for the cast to win each week?",

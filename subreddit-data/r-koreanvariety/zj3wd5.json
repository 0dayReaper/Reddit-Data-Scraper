The main game consists of listening to a song and determining the correct lyrics for a part of it while employing different hints to get closer to the solution. Every failed attempt means more food for YouTube mukbang star Small-mouthed Haetnim. During Snack Time a different game each week determines who gets to try a snack representing this week's market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Host**\n\n* Boom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Shin Dong-yeop\n* Kim Dong-hyun\n* Moon Se-yoon\n* Park Narae\n* Hanhae\n* Key\n* Nucksal\n* Taeyeon\n* Haetnim\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Guests**\n\n* Lee Sunbin\n* Han Seonhwa\n* Jung Eunji\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**One Shots**\n\n|Member|2022|Overall|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Key|32|94|\n|Seyoon|13 + 2|75|\n|P.O\\*|8|56|\n|Hanhae|16 + 1|54|\n|Hyeri\\*|0|49|\n|Nucksal|10|44|\n|Narae|3|38|\n|Taeyeon|7|20|\n|Shin Dongyeob|2|15|\n|Donghyun|1|15|\n|Haetnim|1|1|\n\n\\*\\*updated based on Wiki\n\n**Subtitles**\n\n|**Stream**|Link|\n|:-|:-|\n|Streaming site|[Viu](https://www.viu.com/ott/ph/en-us/vod/465959/Amazing-Saturday-2022)|\n\n**Source**\n\n\\*Viu\n\n^(\\*you can still support @/dareumi from all the subtitle works they had done for the community by donating through -)  [^(ko-fi.com/dareumi)](https://ko-fi.com/dareumi) ^(+)",

Combines the classic Korean outdoor variety show struggles for food and accomodation, but with a more modern spin of upgrading your home. Really smart imo, at least from producer's side you can prepare so much more efficiently in a singular location and it's easy to renew or go to a next season with new spot/cast. \nI hope that they keep pushing the purchase side of things by tempting them with time sales or adding silly things like installation fees (would love to see the girls avoid paying this and go full Ikea home improvement mode).\n\nGlad that Ye to the Na could join already, she has great sense for these things and slotted in so easily and already brought a great moment with Chaewon. Hyeri-omma of course stays no.1 in terms of experience and is actually leading quite well. Lee Jung actually also great at hyping up the other members, love to see the screen time well divided. \nAlthough the moments between quests so far have not been as engaging as the games, I think they can come together and find their stride and it seems the producers are also capable to accommodate by giving them more/less to do to fill screen time.\n\nCan't wait to see enthusiastic Miyeon's fridge next week and how many more pink outfits Patricia can come up with for the remainder of the show!",

Everyone's really entertaining in their own way and it truly feels like a group of friends having fun.\n\nI think Hyeri did a great job leading them in the first day and her dance breaks were the highlight for me. Leejung's good at guessing songs, even if her time perception is terrible (how is 2013 3 years ago again? \ud83d\ude02 ) and I'm so amazed how she came up with &gt;!Unnies!&lt; just like that. The snacks bit was too hilarious, I had to rewind a couple of times to watch different people.\n\nP.S. There are Spanish/Portuguese subs on subscene if anyone's interested.

Right now, I almost feel annoyed every time she stops and runs away.\n* I don't know how Yena can walk into a room of sleeping people where she only knows one of them and lie down like that. I'd feel too uncomfortable and just stay in the living room.\n* The JoYuriz strikes again with people getting confused between Chaewon and Yena. To be fair, they just woke up in a dark room and this is the closest in hairstyles I can remember them having. It's funny that I think Chaewon put on glass frames so you could tell them apart. Also, you can see how Yena's presence improves the cast dynamic as she sets off Chaewon. Maybe she can get Miyeon to let go too.\n* For the games, the PD should have realized the issue and adjusted the way the games are played. At the end they were giving one of them a song she choreographed just so they would have enough money to buy bedding, and even made a flash sale so they could also buy food at a discount. I think it would be a better game if they either left it an open free-for-all where anyone can answer once and then they are out, or like an old game show let an individual 'bank' money before starting so they can keep what others earned and start over with a $250 question. 'Banking' would be great as they can still yell and complain at each other, but still get enough money to get by in this system. 'Banking' would also work with things like that morning challenge game.",

Yena will pull Chaewon out and give us some Tom and Jerry. Miyeon you can even see by her inability to complete a dance before running and ducking for cover. XD*  \n  \nMiyeon needs some guidance I feel. Some reassurance that she can do these things. It's cute how she gets flustered, but it's also frustrating to see her verge on some great moments and bail just before hitting it home.  \n  \nThe level of the games is fairly difficult. At least the PD has realized adjustments may be necessary and is working on it.  \n&gt;!Yena is good at a hoverboard, so you'd think she'd be able to nail a balance challenge like that, but she didn't have the practice time and the pressure adds to the difficulty. Challenging is good, but the heart rate and balance board didn't seem fair, while the ice bucket was just too easy. I'm fine with the burpees since it's the 1st step and the repetition is what makes it challenging.!&lt;    \n  \nIt would definitely be an improvement without the reset to zero mechanic after a failure. Instead of having a game worth 5,000 points but more likely to result in 0-500, have it worth 1,500 points but more likely to result in 500-1000.  \nYou can still have some high stakes games as a finale, but if all they are doing is barely earning enough to eat during the regular games, a large chunk of the premise is out the window and it becomes an eating show instead of a show where they are building a living space.  \nLet Patricia have some gonggi!",

They start off roughing it which is great for comedy and team bonding but I imagine as they get more stuff deeper into the show, it will allow for the show to transition into a R&amp;R (healing) series in which they do get to relax, eat well and hangout together. \n\nI honestly hope this series does really well so it gets a season 2 (and beyond). I think the show has a LOT of potential as an on-going series because it can just be new casts each time. There are a bunch of combinations of entertainers, all girls, all boys and mix gender that with their chemistry alone would make the show a blast. Imagine Key, Minho, KoreanEnglishmen, Eunhyuk (Super Junior), Code Kunst and BamBam. Now imagine a mixed cast with Gabee, Teo Yoo, Lee Kwangsoo, Mijoo, Hani, and Lee Yi-kyung.  Then another season of all girls with one of the members from Mamamoo, Chuu, Yuqi, Oh Ha-young (APink), Yunjin or Eunchae (Lesserafim), Yeri or Wendy (Red Velvet), \n\nOther variety talents that I'd love to see on the show that come to mind: Park Jin-joo, almost any SNSD member (but especially Taeyeon, SooYoung and Hyoyeon), Joo Woo-jae, the funny members from WJSN, Bibi, An Yu-jin (LSF) and many more. I can't help but dream (cause I doubt it happens due to scheduling conflicts) of Jihyo and her bestie Kim Se-jeong on the same season. Anyone that knows TWICE knows how hard Jihyo would compete to win. \n\nI also dream of Somi being on, hell The Black Label doesn't have her doing anything, she has the time. Get her and one of her besties on and let her comedy, extroverted personality and friends with everyone in the industry self be the start of the show. Heck, give the fans a mini I.O.I. reunion by having Somi, Kim Se-jeong, Do-yeon and Yoo-jung on in the same season. Add to that group Jihyo and one maknae they all adore and baby that's a big extrovert, like Chuu or Eunchae, and you've got a hit season guaranteed. Both in terms of fanbases tuning in no matter what and entertainment cause they are all so fun and funny. If the maknae was Chuu then the kiosk could provide Alcohol and you KNOW Jihyo, Se-jeong and Somi would be burning through points on booze which once drinking could lead to some S-tier highlight scenes. See Heechul's 'Street Alcohol Fighter' and Lee Young Ji 'No Prepare' shows on YouTube to see how even the biggest idols drink and act on camera.",

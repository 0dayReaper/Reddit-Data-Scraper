Some people take 1 - 3 month maybe more to fully heal. Hope he have speedy recoveries. \n\nHe really important for RM, without him it totally feel different. We will see how the new PD will handle this. Either continue filming with 7 member or bring someone in temporary.",

But one of the reasons why I wanted the show to be in a short hiatus is to give the members a period where they can take a moment of breath and having a space to reorganize and planning for better future eps. Runningman compare with other variety shows, we don't have seasonal breaks. They literally shoot non stop every single week for 10 years which probably one of few reasons the ratings went down.",

If ever the variety gods were sending the show a sign that it needs some time off, LKS getting injured and missing the show now out of all times should be that sign.

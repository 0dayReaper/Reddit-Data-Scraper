In this new season, Dong Il and Hee Won will be   joined by a  new member, Rowoon. The house has also been upgraded and   renovated.  Meanwhile, they will invite friends over who they can\u2019t meet   up often  due to busy schedules and treat them to nice food and enjoy   simple  happiness together.\n\n**Cast:**\n\n* Sung Dong-il  (\uc131\ub3d9\uc77c)\n* Kim Hee-won (\uae40\ud76c\uc6d0)\n* Rowoon (\ub85c\uc6b4)\n\n**Guests**:\n\n* Kim Hyeyoon (\uae40\ud61c\uc724)\n* Lee Jaewook (\uc774\uc7ac\uc6b1)\n\n|E8 (720p-NEXT)|magnet:?xt=urn:btih:2c6548112278f1578be1539d52a9ac7ea8b2e477|[Subscene](https://subscene.com/subtitles/house-on-wheels-4-wheeled-house-4-bakwidallinjib-4--4/english/2943178)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n\n\n&gt;!Heewon's Do you want to go out with me? !&lt;\ud83d\ude02 I really love seeing these three together and I hope their friendship lasts for a long time, preferably until they get as old as Dongil and Heewon.

You could really feel everyone getting close. Hope Rowoon pays a visit in future seasons like Yeo Jin Goo did",

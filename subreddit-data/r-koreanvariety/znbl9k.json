JSM also really showcasing her expertise in dating. Her observation and commentary was on point. Now i'm also realized why Nucksal is appeared in a lot of shows, he can blend in really well and give a really good reaction. \nPersonally i like Iron Min editing, and it seems to be perfect in this format. Really looking forward for the next episodes",

The subtitles/captions or text on screen (in Korean) are so funny on his shows. RM's text game is getting weaker and weaker. They've also entirely stopped using theme songs and sound effects and text on the screen and filler shots. \n\nAlthough, I will never miss the repeat shots of multiple angles and slow motions. Still, I'm willing to overlook them as everything else is great.",

I mean let's say you watch how NA pd's crew editing their fast paced editing especially the game segment with other program who have similar concept and playing same. Maan, the diff is real and after experience the fast cut paced editing, other show who play games and using more slower tempo feels bored to me. (Unconsciously keep comparing and imagine what if na pd crew is the one who editing the show is my problem now) \n\n(Although some show doesn't necessary good with fast paced cut editing since well there's \"healing\"/travel program that need to show relax that represented by the slow editing)",

It stands out in comparison to the really serious vibe currently in K dating shows. It also paid homage to older dating variety shows with the set and live hosts but in a modern way. It\u2019s has the perfect blend of comedy with Yu jae seok,Somin and Nuksals commentary. I really like that in the mist of dating shows with fixed cast, it seems we will have different people every few episodes leading to more funny and \u201cfluttering\u201d moments. \n\nP.S Couldn\u2019t stop laughing the whole ep. Especially during the awkward dates like with the Extroverted girl and Introverted guy. Also the guy who showed his abs as a skill. The editing was too good.",

Dating shows aren't exactly my cup of tea.\n\nBut seeing the MC's lineup and Iron Min, it'll be a miss if I didn't at least give it a chance. And after watching it, I'm definitely glad I did.\n\nDuring the first meeting with the boys, I caught right away that the psychiatrist have an interesting personality. The Abs show is absolutely hilarious. I definitely share the same sense of humor with YJS. Cringe and awkward moments are just 'it'. It's endearing seeing people trying their best even though they might not be good at it. Which is why I also like that 'After Like' dance.\n\nCan't wait to see what will happen between the engineer and the flight attendant.",

The doctor is my favorite so far; his ab show was perfect variety moment. Although, didn't like his comment about the youngest girl being \"an old soul\". Kind of sounds like what older men say to fool younger women and also make themselves feel better about going after someone much younger.\n\nAnyways, love love love the banter of YJS, JSM and Nucksal.

He finds himself in a state of burnout and mannerism so he chose to find his real \"self\" by going to the other side of the world!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Kian84 left for South America with only one bag on his back along with Lee Si-eon, the real brother who ran for him, and Pani Bottle, the travel YouTuber.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"It can't be more raw than this.\" A 10-day journey that you will experience for the first time in your life. From the moment you get off the plane, you can't even predict what's ahead. This is the three men's crazy trip to South America!\n\n**Links:**\n\n* [Official website](https://program.imbc.com/AdventurebyAccident): Sunday at 4:30 p.m.\n* MyDramaList\n\n**Cast:**\n\n* Lee Sieon (\uc774\uc2dc\uc5b8)\n* Kian84 (\uae30\uc54884)\n* PaniBottle\n\n**Panel:**\n\n* Simon D (\uc0ac\uc774\uba3c \ub3c4\ubbf8\ub2c9)\n* Jang Doyeon (\uc7a5\ub3c4\uc5f0)\n* MINO (\uc1a1\ubbfc\ud638)\n\n|E01.221211.720p-NEXT|magnet:?xt=urn:btih:510397f30c606a2c73834e78926af10ef47da903|[Subscene](https://subscene.com/subtitles/adventure-by-accident/english/2951306)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n\n\n&gt;&gt;!\"How many underwear do you have?\"!&lt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;!\"Three.

Very expected ending but this is the best outcome anyway especially since this works best as a one off. \n\nSomewhat unrelated to the actual episode but MBC is taking waaaayyyy too long from the leaking of the article to making actual changes and the ratings are showing the effects of that. They\u2019re handling it badly so far and idk what will actually happen in the end but if it turns out there will be no changes in casts, then letting that info leak instead of outright denying it and stopping it will prove to be a huge mistake that costed the show greatly for no reason. They really need to announce whatever will happen soon, viewers are getting impatient and just dropping the show.",

This reflects in how the rating for the episode is low but several clips from the episode are already viral on social media. Or perhaps they are favoured among the younger audience who watch on OTT rather than older audience who watch on TV. \n\nThis concept was a very weak idea by the PD but because these two are so adorable and heart fluttering it works. Couldn't stop smiling watching them this episode.",

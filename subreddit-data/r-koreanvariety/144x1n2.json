            "comment": "He's one of my favorites, too, and one of the reasons I can't drop ILA even when it gets kind of slow. Adventure by Accident is a great show to showcase his unpredictability and has given me several laughs because of the absurdness of situations. It also highlights his sentimentality because who else would sleep over a complete stranger's home just to experience the region in it's most natural state and make a friend on the other side of the globe? I honestly cannot wait for s2 this Sunday!",

Korea's been hit by the travel variety bug so there are a ton of them coming out, including Adventure by Acccident season 2.",

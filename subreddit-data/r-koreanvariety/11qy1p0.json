    "postText": "Since nobody posted it for the past week, some people on Twitter/Instagram/etc. actually reposted Channel A's (\ucc44\ub110a) \ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110 upcoming schedule for their shows.\n\nYou can see the video trailer here from the \ucc44\ub110A \uce94\ubc84\uc2a4 channel, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWI6RdAj6Pk, and it says **Heart Signal 4 (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub1104) should be available this May**. That's the longest two months, for real.\n\n---\n\nRight now there's somewhat a drought of new Korean/Chinese/Japanese/etc. dating shows. But once again, that start of the summer, second half of the year is looking stacked, just like 2022.\n\nThis Heart Signal 4 might come on Netflix with English/etc. subs, so expect another influx like with Single's Inferno (2). And then the Chinese version of Heart Signal is also starting recruitment for its 6th season now, lol.\n\nImagine if, instead of just Viki or WeTV/Tencent Video, we also have the Chinese version of Heart Signal available on international Netflix too. The Chinese version of Heart Signal is really underrated.\n\nLike some other Chinese dating shows are actually so good and they produce them year-round these days with English subs. \n\nThe YOUKU channel in particular has so much extra content for Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81) and so on. Like they have bonus content without the panelists, actual unreleased scenes, livestreams with the housemates watching the episodes together, et cetera.\n\nAnd then apparently the **Nineteen to Twenty (\uc5f4\uc544\ud649\uc2a4\ubb3c)**, which looks to be the Korean version of Twinkle Love (or coming of age graduation/field trip a la Ainori Love Wagon), is probably additionally releasing in Q3 or second half of 2023.\n\nBy the way, Netflix also has that sorta Terrace House (/r/terracehouse) successor coming up soon, **Love Village or Ai no Sato**: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/u2uiyf/a_new_japanese_netflix_show_called_love_village/\n\n---\n\nIf only there was time travel to fast forward and so on.",

Hopefully they bring the earlier Korean seasons to international Netflix too. \n\nFor the current 5 seasons of the Chinese version, those are possibly gonna remain on Viki(/Tencent Video/etc.) for a while as there's probably some exclusivity/etc. licensing deals.\n\nHaha and ya hopefully Heart Signal has crazy scenes like Seul-ki and Jin-young by the pool to generate crazy hype: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW7wPSbHlmg\n\nOh wow, The Swoon channel got renamed to Netflix K-Content, when did that happen, lol.\n\nBut there's that familiar anxiety where one of the housemates will have a scandal or something and then they'll get edited out, lmao. It basically happened with both the Korean and Chinese versions of Heart Signal. And then the people that pursue or interact with them had like reduced or no screen time.\n\nLike Yang Yang/4th girl from Heart Signal Chinese Version Season 3 was barely seen at all because the 4th boy was found to be like a cheater/et cetera, rofl. This is her, don't click unless you know the ending of Heart Signal Chinese Version Season 2 (and 3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvgvE2BTlwI\n\nHopefully there's some cool changes in the show too as it's been so long since Heart Signal 3 and Friends. Wonder how the panelists will be, all I know is that Kim Eana (the songwriter) better be there, lol.",

And so I'll probably just mention one reddit link that has like a collection of links in order to point in the direction of say iheartu2's Twitter, the filters/configurations for the newer dating shows in MyDramaList, or those Google Docs databases that some people maintain, et cetera.\n\nBecause ya I just ramble on for too much, lmao, ain't nobody got time to read that. This will reduce that off-topic discussion to just one line/link that has even more links, lol. \n\nI transferred over some of those comments to /r/terracehouse for the mean time as /r/Singlesinferno2 has quite a few of them. And like there was some drama there now for some reason (it went private for like a day, kinda how /r/SinglesInfernoNetflix is private/inaccessible for the past year) and so now we have like /r/Singlesinferno_2 (this is the most active secondary one), /r/SinglesInferno123, et cetera, lol.\n\nBut ya no worries, I pretty much just recommend stuff or in the discussions threads for the episodes of a new dating show I'll probably inevitably weave in some text about past dating shows, the slow disclosure of interdimensional UAPs, slice of life reality, et cetera to make it a bit less expected. \n\nI'll keep it reined in and brief since my focus is randomly all over the place and I gotta fix it. Like yup I somehow keep going on tangents because it's an area I'm really interested in, too much excitement, smh lol.\n\nHeart Signal 4 could be the best yet. If you haven't already, try the 2nd and 5th seasons of the Chinese version of Heart Signal, it's on Viki/et cetera, and those are considered the best seasons too.",

(\uc88b\uc544\ud558\uba74 \uc6b8\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9dd!\uc9dd!\uc9dd!)**, apparently the English/etc. subs are on Dailymotion.\n\nY'all can probably binge-watch the Korean/Chinese/Japanese/etc. dating shows within 60 or so days. Before we get immersed in this new Heart Signal 4 world.\n\nLike rewatch the previous seasons of the Korean version of Heart Signal and then if you haven't watched the Chinese version of Heart Signal yet, check it out on Viki/etc.\n\nOr, if you haven't experienced **Terrace House** (/r/terracehouse) or **Shanghai Sharelife** (/r/Shanghaisharelife) yet then now is the time to do so as those have a lot of episodes, lol.

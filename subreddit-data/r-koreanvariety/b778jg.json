Other Korean Americans and recent Korean immigrants frequented it quite often.\n\nIt's how I watched my first drama--jumong, my dad was obsessed. Even when we moved to a less diverse suburban soccer mom utopia, there was one random Korean convenience store with a video shop attached. Lol, Koreans like their entertainment. Then the internet developed so much that now its instantaneous and you can rewind without fear! And now my parents are even more addicted to kdrama......",

Everyone remembered when one episode was split into 10 part. The painful feeling when you tried to download 8th part and suddenly the link was broken and that part was never found on internet. But then again, I still have to wait for a week or two until now for most of my favourite to be shown on TV via KBSWorld, SOne, OK!, and TVN Asia so nothing changed much for me. lol",

So please keep watching legally if possible from VIU, ODK, Kocowa, or whatever platform available to keep them alive.",

It is so not like &gt;!Jinho to make such a rookie mistake, especially since he is known to be cautious and detailed.!&lt; I\u2019m in disbelief\u2026 no words lol that was so massively disappointing.\n\nSemi-finals was fun, the finals not so much. Hidden Mission was at least creative, but the rest\u2026 lol. They\u2019re reusing 1:1 games too often. while I get that it\u2019s still fresh to the players, as a viewer I got very bored of watching the same games for the third time\n\nNonetheless Bloody Game 2 was definitely a huge upgrade from last season, it has been a wild and entertaining ride",

I thought at the very least they could have done what The Genius did and have the other contestants come in and give an advantage to whoever they preferred in the Finals.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Also I thought it was interesting that Hyun Ji was not shown to have returned to watch the Finals. It looked like everything was filmed the same day as the semis so I'm curious where she was during this time.!&lt;",

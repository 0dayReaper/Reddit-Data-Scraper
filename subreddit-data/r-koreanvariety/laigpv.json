    "postText": "*Notification: This post is outdated, please refer to* [*this*](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/mxsr1s/girls_high_mystery_class_final_ver_eng_sub/) *for the final version of our release of the show. Links here are no longer reliable and they're lame as heck yo.*\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nA mystery adventure series from the mind behind The Genius and The Great Escape, detailing the Mystery Class at the prestigious Saera Girls' High School as they attempt to uncover the secrets behind suspicious events occurring at their new school.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Park Jiyoon\n* Jang Doyeon\n* Choi Yena\n* Jaejae\n* Bibi\n\nSo after MEGA didn't end up panning out, we've decided to use an online host for easy streaming (and downloading) of the 720p hardsubs. And then for the higher quality 1080p softsub version (please use VLC or another good player), we'll be using a torrent site. And just to make sure it's as available as possible, I'll repost the links for E1 instead of just editing the previous post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Links\n\n**\\*You can find all the finalised episodes in** [**this**](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/mxsr1s/girls_high_mystery_class_final_ver_eng_sub/) **post**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long magnets, but I've been told that truncating the magnet would make it harder to find seeds for people. And on that note, please try and seed if you can!\n\n*PS. If you appreciate the translation work, maybe consider giving me a tip to help my work going at* [*https://ko-fi.com/baechusquad*](https://ko-fi.com/baechusquad)*.*",

Sorta makes it a little different from tge. Jiyoon proves to be a sleuth. Im amazed she was able to soak in everything and do critical thinking on her feet, hopefully the rest catches up or shines in their own way.",

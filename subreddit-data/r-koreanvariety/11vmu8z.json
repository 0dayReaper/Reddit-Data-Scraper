            "comment": "I tuned in for Season 2 because of the Kim Dong Hyun/Lee Dae Hoon dynamic in Season 1. They seemed to always be paired up or do challenges against each other back then. And I still enjoy whenever they have interactions on the show (highlight being Donghyun trying to recruit Dae Hoon for Jiu Jitsu lessons).\n\nI also like the Anchovies haha with special mention to Chil Heung Min\u2026 gotta love his expressions, and how he improved overtime. \n\nI like maknae Jo Wonwoo as well\u2026 he just seems    to be an honest to goodness easygoing guy. And it helps that he\u2019s quite a competent football player as well. Shame he\u2019s only on for very few episodes.",

            "comment": "Yes hehe that sparring match was awesome and really showed how great he is as a taekwondo athlete. But I understand why he retired too. The active athlete saying it was a good thing he was born late was so funny, as well as when the anchovies plus Taebeom flew from those kicks. I\u2019ve actually watched the whole thing since I understand Korean. One of my fave eps in a while, there\u2019s something about Taekwondo being the national sport that makes any showcase on these shows very touching.\n\nMy faves hmm\u2026 they kind of rotate depending on the arch or episodes\u2026 But I like the anchovy avengers so much too, they\u2019re really the core of the team for me with them doing all the heavy running and Chilgu, Daehoon, and Minho must be the most driven to improve. Daehoon was always my fave in S1 (with Hur Jae), and he\u2019s still up there for me.",

I love the anchovy brothers because they usually in most of the episodes are the ones working and running the hardest in my opinion. Chilku constantly being the cleaner/marking man, Daehoon always showing a consistent performance with a couple really good plays, Minho being the endurance machine who also gets put in positions he\u2019s never wanted, and all of them in my own honest opinion get took for granted too much \ud83d\ude2d.\n\nPS I like Junho as well he just is absent a lot",

Ryu Eun Gyu always got a chance to score but mostly missed the goals because he was always rushing (istg everyone in the team have this problem), but once he scored, he kept going. \n\nMy bias Captain Lim Nam Kyu, on the other hand, had a few hiccups at the beginning but managed to be the team's captain and scored the highest amount of goals.\n\nI like Lee Dae Hoon too. He looks like a proud dad whenever Nam Kyu scored a goal. I didn't like him when he first joined the team. He looks quite shy at first but now he looks so bubbly.",

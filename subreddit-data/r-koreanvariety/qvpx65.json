    "postText": "https://www.soompi.com/article/1499016wpp/lovelyzs-mijoo-officially-signs-with-antenna\n\nLovelyz\u2019s Mijoo has signed an exclusive contract with Antenna!\n\nOn November 17, Antenna revealed the news and said, \u201cLee Mijoo has always given her best in both her promotions with Lovelyz and individual promotions and has shown her wide spectrum through her unique style and personality. We will provide unsparing support so that Lee Mijoo can unleash her flair and talent to the fullest. Please show lots of support for Lee Mijoo, who is set to make a fresh start.\n\nThe agency also shared a social media post to welcome Mijoo, writing, \u201cAntenna is joined by Lee Mijoo, who always fills her surroundings with bright and positive energy and does her best in every moment. We will create shining days ahead as we steadily walk with her while having fun. Hoping that our steps create happy smiles on the faces of many, we extend a warm welcome.\u201d\n\nMijoo also shared through Antenna, \u201cAntenna\u2019s motto that seeks \u2018good people, good music, and good smiles\u2019 coincided with the picture I wanted to draw. I\u2019ll convey good energy through various activities from now on, so please look forward to it.\u201d\n\nFounded by Yoo Hee Yeol, Antenna houses stars including Sam Kim, Kwon Jin Ah, Lee Jin Ah, Jung Seung Hwan, Jukjae, and more. Yoo Jae Suk, who has worked with Mijoo on programs including \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d and \u201cHow Do You Play?\u201d also signed with Antenna in July of this year.\n\nMijoo debuted as a member of Lovelyz under Woollim Entertainment in 2014. Earlier this month, it was announced that she, along with six of her teammates, would leave Woollim Entertainment after their contracts expired on on November 16, 2021.\n\nWishing Mijoo all the best at Antenna!",

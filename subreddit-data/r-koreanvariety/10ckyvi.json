    "postText": "I just finished episode 10 of Love Alarm and my jaw dropped at the end of the episode, like literally jaw dropping, mind bending, didn't see it coming at all, for me it was the most shocking twist I've seen on any reality dating show I've watched.\n\nFor spoilers: &gt;!one of the female contestants was basically stringing along 2 different guys the first 10 episodes, she told both that she was giving them heart messages but when the guys talked they found out she was lying to them, and when one of the guys confronted her she told him she was lying to the men so she could get more 'hearts' and that she actually liked one the female contestants all along, and they flashback to start of the show and show clips of her liking/flirting with the girl all season!&lt;\n\nSo I was wondering if there were any shocking twists or surprisess that made your jaw drop from any on these dating shows, please share.",

            "comment": "Honestly. I think every show has a shocking twist. Its gotten so bad that I expect it. The people that you think should get together never get together and the ones that have a toxic relationship always end up together.\n\nThere are so many moments where people enjoy their dates and then select someone they\u2019ve barely talked to at the end purely because that person was their type. \n\nWhenever two people hit it off, one of them always gets uninterested because they prefer to be the chaser and can\u2019t grow feelings for people who obviously like them. \n\nSome notable ones that were especially weird. \n\nIn Terrace House Boys and Girls Next Door, there was a girl that was brought onto the show purely because she said that she liked Tecchan who was basically a loser, every girl couldn\u2019t imagine dating Tecchan but everyone became friends with Tecchan and he was poor so he never left the show. The show tried to pair him up and get him to leave but you can obviously tell that the girl was only using the show to propel her music career. She would draw a line at certain points and Tecchan could obviously tell because he didn\u2019t like her back, even though he tried to date basically every girl that appeared on the show. \n\nIn Terrace House Boy and Girls in the City (i think this is the right season), there was a young girl that was some type of Idol that had a pure image to uphold, and all of the cast members eventually exposed that she was dating the chef off camera and keeping it a secret that they liked eachother when they were on camera to uphold her image.\n\nIn Shanghai Share Life, there was a moment that was obviously scripted/heavily encouraged by the producers where two guys confess their feelings on stage for one of the girls. The first guy had a onesided love, and composed a song to express his love for her even though the girl had tried to turn him down multiple tomes, and then the youngest guy in the house went on the stage after him and confessed his feelings for her while she was sitting their awkwardly. It was so uncomfortable for her that she just ended up leaving.\n\nAlso, Id maybe through Bloody Game up there as well. This show wasn\u2019t even supposed to be a dating show and yet some of the members got drunk and basically started dating eachother causing all kinds of chaos in how the games were played, and there is a particular twist in the game that made this show amazing, even though I really wish the rapper wasn\u2019t on that show, Imo she basically ruined the show because her decision making was so stupid that it made it impossible for any of the other contestants to make big brain moves.",

At 47:50 it looks like there are several cracks in the screen like tree branches.\n\nIs it weird that their downtime games they do themselves are often more fun than the show's official games? &gt;!The strength game was fun. Yena couldn't even beat Patricia who was using just 3 fingers, but made sure she lorded her leg win over Chaewon. Having watched Rose describe Hyeri's legs as tree trunks, I knew the champion before they started. Except for a ringer like Sejeong, I'd expect Hyeri to beat any GG member in a leg contest since they almost all chose diet over exercise to keep their weight down. I also enjoyed the jenga game with the quests and hope they play again next week.!&lt;\n\nI would not have expected this outcome from the cup game. &gt;!Clearly the staff were also confused that the girls managed to keep winning. I expected to see that black line move up the container to make it harder, but instead it appears they are going to put them in debt for the cost of the whole house next week. Jonathan is pretty funny, and it will be interesting to see how he does in the games with the girls. And I'm guessing his housewarming gift is going to be deducted from their earnings.!&lt;",

Classic staff of a TV show normies versus a group filled with celebs who have most of which are in teams and have done lots of variety content before. They're pros with games like that.",

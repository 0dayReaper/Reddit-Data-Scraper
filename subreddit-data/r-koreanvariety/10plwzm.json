The cast members have known it as a healing program in a villa with everything, but they welcomed them in an empty house with nothing but white walls and white floors. Rumor has it that the cast members who saw this could not hide their embarrassment by raising their resentment toward the production team.\n&gt; \n&gt; Under the slogan \"From non-possession to full ownership,\" Hye-ri, Miyeon, Li-jung, Choi Ye-na, Kim Chae-won, and Patricia get the necessary supplies for housing and fill empty houses through various missions. In particular, expectations are high for a novel combination that has never been seen anywhere, from Hyeri to Miyeon, Li Jung, Choi Ye-na, Kim Chae-won and Patricia.\n\nNo info on episode count/release date/subs as far as I know.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/balloon_wanted/status/1620225286670528513",

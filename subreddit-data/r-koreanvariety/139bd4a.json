Love Catcher somehow always get the most charming women. \n\nI'm more concerned how Heart Signal retain its position when there're 100 variations of love reality shows since it came to the scene. I don't know this original format would appeal to the audience",

Visually the recent love catcher had way too many to pass up, so I can\u2019t help but compare now when I see new shows.",

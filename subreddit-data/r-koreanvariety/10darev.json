            "comment": "I also watch the show on Netflix. For Chilku, he really is a DM so he rarely gets the recognition (he usually gets it if he can control the midfield/shut down one of the opponents who crosses his area. For Eungyoo, he is usually out (Lacrosse duties) so Nam Kyu will always be a priority but he is a good striker. Daehoon and Junhyeon are good/great in their roles so they will always be called out if they make some errors on attacks.\n\nJangkun for me is a rare breed/natural as he can play FW and CB. I do believe that editing also has a factor. We know Jangkun's past (I feel like the public has a special space/affection for him) and I think he now stays in Korea unlike before that he plays in India. I also think as well that he's marketable, guys like him (he crushed those watermelons) plus ladies like him as well (I think he's still single plus has the looks that Koreans will like for an athlete).",

I like what they have done with Nam Kyu and Eungyoo recently (real time version).  Both players have gotten used to their spots, and they work really well together.  Since the Netflix is like 2 months behind, I have to watch both because I  can't wait to see the results, but I like knowing the details of their jokes too lol",

I love defending, so it's hard not to notice his lack of positioning and defensive IQ.  \n\nDude is out of position at least three times a game and isn't a good passer either.\n\nThose two things are absolutely crucial to being a good defender. \n\nCho Won-woo is the best defender on the entire team imo. Good pace, good strength, solid positioning, and times his tackles well.  \n\nJanggun's pace and strength are better up front or at left wing. It's unfortunate that those are filled by two of the best players on the team.",

The coaches imagine what he could do if he really clicks, but from what I have seen,  it's like the way his brain works just doesn't click with soccer the way it does with kabaddi. For me, recently, it has been the inconsistency of the team that has frustrated me a bit.  There are a few players  who consistently perform, but even last week, the others started that game playing so sloppy.  Easy balls were misplayed, they didn't receive passes cleanly.  The goal given up was pretty weak.  If they could actually play their best consistently, they would beat just about every armature team.  But sometimes they play really sharp and clean, and sometimes they play really sloppy.  I mean, that is sports in general.  Professional teams do the same thing.  But you just get that sense that they are close to being really good, if they could just be consistent with their focus and effort.",

Good looking, great body, entertaining on and off the field, even had a nice sob story of being athlete in an unknown sport with no fundings.\n\nHe used to be the top scorer but his finishing is extremely inconsistent. Unfortunately the more he played the more inconsistent he became as a striker. Putting him in the CB position is much more suited for him and his chemistry with Jae-Un is great for the backline. He got a lot of MOMs when he was the striker but as the CB, I don't think he got it much.\n\nEun Gyoo IMO is Janggun V2. Eun Gyoo's finishing is inconsistent as well but when he performed, he is usually one of the candidates for MOM and he has quite a number of MOMs under his belt. Eun Gyoo is also on the improved Eojeoda Avengers team so they created more opportunities for the strikers. Eun Gyoo himself also created scoring opportunities as well.\n\nAs for Dae Hoon, Jun Hyeon and Chilku that you mentioned in your original post, due to the natural of their positions, it is hard for them to outshine the strikers for the MOM. Unless they managed to score a crucial goal (which Dae Hoon usually does and when he did that, he is oneo f the candidate for MOM) or made an insanely good assist / play. Jun Hyeon and Chilku unfortunately are less flashy / prominent on the field but the team will fall apart if they are not there to facilitate the passing and build-up. Unfortunately those are kinda the thankless positions so it is hard for them to get recognised as the MOM especially against players who scored multiple goals, score the game-winning goal, etc.",

Over rated...the system is good. I always feel these 2 players dragged the team down...\n\nIMO though, manager should put Lee Jang-Kun as striker instead of MF...he is fast but not nimble...too many MF now..so try to expose / train him to be FWD.",

He wasn't effective as a striker hence he got moved to be a defender.\n\nIf he was consistent and good as a striker, no manager in their right mind will change his position.\n\nJang Gun only shined in the beginning of Gentlemen's League 2 because the original members from Gentlemen League 1 weren't good and they played weaker teams. Even then his conversion rate was low.\n\nAs other members improved and they started playing stronger teams, his weakness became more and more obvious. The team's performance was in a slump (to be fair, not all on him, but if your \"star\" striker can't score, it's gonna hard to win games). That is why they had a 2nd round of audition and recruited Eun Gyu and Nam Kyu who are very consistent.\n\nAfter that Jang Gun was no longer a starter on the team and was usually subbed for the last 15 - 20 min.\n\nSwitching him to defender allowed him to be part of the starting lineup again and IMO it was the role he performed best at. He was able to hold the backline well and leading Won Woo and Je-Un well.",

            "comment": "OUT: Jun-hyeon, Jang-kun, and Hyung-taik. \n\n\nOut of all the three, I think Jang-kun is the obvious one that deserves to be out because he's the only player that just got worse and worse and worse. He literally never improved any of his skills. His flaws can be accepted at the start, but it becomes impossible to defend after more than a year and no progress. I expect him to be completely out of the team unless they really run out of players and no other choice.\n\n\nHyung-taik is understandable to be out, but I don't think he's that much worse than Dong-hyun. Both are capable of making good saves, but both also have their own glaring weakness. Hyung-taik is that his body can't really keep up when facing stronger opponents. Dong-hyun is that his decision making is questionable at times. I expect Hyung-taik to still make appearance time to time.\n\n\nJun-hyeon is a bit of a 50-50 to me. I agree with the manager that he hasn't improved much, but I also think that he can still bring more into the team than Tae-bum. The main problem with Jun-hyeon for me is that I don't think LB is the correct position for him so he could probably work fine at a different position. Having said that, Tae-bum is a good option to have to play for 10 minutes or so near the end of the game. I don't expect to see Jun-hyeon as much anymore, but he can definitely still make few appearances here and there.\n\n\nOthers that I think should be let go:\n\n* Yo-han: I really think he's the worst GK out of the 4 which is a shame because he has potential, but I don't think his body can keep up.\n\n* Jun-ho: I don't think he improves much at all, and he's too skinny. As the opponents get stronger, his thin physique would just mean that he'd lose tussling a lot. \n\n\nLastly, I just want to say that I'm really happy that Ji-hwan got through. He has improved so much throughout the whole show that I think the LB starting position should be comfortably his now.",

                    "comment": "agreed, I've thought this for awhile, Junhyeon also used to play attacking wing (i.e. outside of Avengers).  His defensive skills definitely have gone up but from my opinion has always been suitable in the forward wing position (i.e. where Mo Taebum or Jihwan usually get assigned). I've said somewhere before, but the show never highlights when he does good - sending cut-through passes up the line to Namkyu or Eungyu and he has better ball handling than Taebum or Jihwan... at the end of it all it seems like he's just not favoured by AJH.\n\nEverything JunYi and Jang Jeongmin bring to the team aswell couldve been covered by Junhyeon (except for maybe tussling, which the rugby players excel at).\n\nEven Daehoon hasn't really been showing much lately in the midfield, compared to Chil-gu and Minho (unfortunately Minho is too valuable as a Defensive midfield  for stabilising the defense to move him up the line more often).\n\nJangkun - seems too passive, low ball handling skills so he can't keep the ball, struggles to trap it effectively and also does that slow turn and pass thing which always gets cut or is just in-accurate. He was better on defense where he could use his physique and speed but still makes mistakes there - feels like he struggles to read the flow of the game.\n\n&gt;!Latest episodes with Junhyeon showed when he does stop focusing on attacking and pure defense he's actually quite good at cutting passes and defending, which is probably why he's getting selected again for the 16.!&lt;",

                            "comment": "Jun-hyeon is definitely a victim of how the team didn't have anyone that could play LB at the start, so he was just plugged there based on his speed and AJH's preference of having LB/RB bombing forward. Unfortunately, he was never really given proper run on another position. I'm hoping now that LB could comfortably be filled by Ji-hwan and Won-woo, that maybe AJH would give Jun-hyeon a chance elsewhere. \n\n\n&gt; feels like he struggles to read the flow of the game.\n\nJang-kun is without a doubt the player with the lowest football IQ in the team. He just doesn't understand what's happening in the game, and therefore not knowing what he's supposed to do. This weakness is somewhat hidden when he played as a defender because being at the back means he only needs to look one way (from the back to the front) and he often has Won-woo or Andre to tell him what to do. As a left winger though, he's basically just clueless. He needs to know what happens on both sides of the pitch, but he just can't. He doesn't know when to make runs, he doesn't know when to drop back, he doesn't know when/where to make the right passes, he doesn't have the stamina, and he panics under pressure.",

They've been saying that for a long time. Is there a chance that the coaches are not correct about that? That Lee Jang Kun has been practicing substantially but just lacks the ability? \n\nOr did Lee Jang Kun really flake his responsibilities and slack off on practice, possibly messing up this huge opportunity?\n\nAlso, is ep 16 the latest that was released on Netflix worldwide? Because isn't Mo Tae Bum in?  \nIt's just the other 3 that are out. Did I totally misunderstand what happened? That's a possibility too.",

                    "comment": "Ep 16 is the latest that is out on Netflix, but Netflix is about 4 eps behind Korea broadcast. Seems like OP is talking about Ep 16 but there are some typos and inaccuracies in what OP that feels odd.\n\n- What OP specifically wrote was \"esp 16\", could be a typo of 'Eps 16' or could be referring to 16 starting lineup?\n\n- Based on Ep 16, Lee Jang Gun, Lee Hyung Taik and Kim Jun Hyeon are out. But OP wrote Jun Hyeon twice and included Mo Tae Bum. OP also wrote that 2 previous captains are out. Only Hyung Taik who is a previous captain that is out. IIRC, Jang Gun and Tae Bum temporarily took over the captain's armband when the actual captain at that time was not on the field or if they subbed for the captain. But that doesn't make them count as \"previous captains\".\n\nSo I am not too sure if OP is specifically talking about Ep 16.\n\nAnyway, back on your question on Jang Gun.\n\nI believe the coaches are right about Jang Gun but more specifically when they say that he did not practice, they were saying that he did not practice to improve on his weak points. He is weak in ball-trapping and dribbling.\n\nHe could only have few self-practice per week (maybe 1 time per week) and in his practice, he could have drilled other stuff like shooting, crossing, long passes, etc. He probably spent little to no time on trapping and dribbling.\n\nTechniques, especially trapping and dribbling can be improved tremendulously with practice before hitting the \"lack of talent\" wall. Kang Chilku and Lee Jihwan are  good examples. They had no experience with soccer prior to joining and you can see how much their ball control skills improved. So Jang Gun definitely did not practice on his weakness. If anything, Jang Gun has better athletism and physicality than Chilku and Jihwan. He is bigger, faster and stronger than them.\n\nAnother thing about Jang Gun is that he is a lazy player on the field. He only stays in his tiny area. He doesn't make runs, he doesn't create space, he has terrible vision on the field, he doesn't position himself well. Whereas Eun Gyu and Nam Kyu are constantly making space and drawing defenders out of position. They are as dangerous off the ball as they are on the ball. Game sense generally builds up slowly from playing games. Jang Gun's lack of game sense showed that he doesn't have enough practice games outside of filming the show.\n\nThe last thing is his mentality. When he loses the ball, he just lowers his head and sigh in frustration while standing still. Comparing to Chilku and Jihwan again, when they loses the ball, they immediately start chasing after it and start hounding the opponent. This is why they nicknamed Chilku the vacuum.\n\nIMO Jang Gun completely deserves to be dropped from the 1st team.\n\nSidenote, does Jang Gun not play Kabbadi in the Indian league anymore? Life is back to normal in Korea and India in term of Covid restrictions, doesn't he need to go back to India for his main job?",

(This is assuming that all K-content on Netflix in other countries are also available on Netflix in Korean.) So a higher licensing fees will cover/hedge against those potential losses. Otherwise building an episodic delay into the licensing contract more or less ensured that viewers will still need to watch on JTBC to be up-to-date.\n\nNetflix executives probably think that having up-to-date broadcasts are not critical for variety shows especially for worldwide audiences. They would prefer the lower licensing fees. Similarly, Knowing Bros (another JTBC variety) is very delayed on Netflix as well.",

It\u2019s just reps and the coaches can\u2019t babysit you all day.\n\nThe coaches have tried again and again to explain what they want him to do in game as well. I honestly think a break might do him the world of good.\n\nI\u2019m assuming he\u2019s not going back to India. Other Korean players are in India. Jangkun still seems to be involved with Kabbadi though. It\u2019s even hard to follow them on Instagram if you don\u2019t want spoilers though.",

Doing well on Eojjeoda could've propelled him toward so many more opportunities. Seems like the lamest kind of self-sabotage to not run through trapping and dribbling drills every week.",

He needed more than 10 tries to complete the training whereas his teammates succeeded with much fewer tries. This is extremely inexcusable for someone who wants to be the main striker of the team. \n\nHe\u2019s had his time in the show. He was the perfect poster boy and he gained fame from joining the show. While the teams\u2019s overall performance is improving, he has actually regressed in his individual performance. He\u2019ll need to improve dramatically for him to get ahead of the reserve squad, let alone the starting squad.",

So discussion for this show on reddit is always risky business as people don't tag the spoilers or state whether it is Netflix eps or Korean broadcast eps.\n\nIMO Jang Gun has good physicality and athleticism but he is not suited to be a FWD. In fact he performed much better when he was a CB when Andre was out due to injury.\n\n&gt;Oh, where is the tall keeper? he is not in the game anymore?\n\nThere's no mention of Kim Yo Han. Officially he should be still on the show. Usually if a member official quit, there would be announcement on the show, like the Yoon Dong Sik (the judoka). It is likely that Yo Han is on extended break due to injury. Yo Han was out due to injury before (that was why Lee Hung Taik can switch to GK), maybe he aggravated his injury again and is out for a long rehab.\n\nThis show is not too consistent with updates on the status of the players. Sometimes it is mentioned, sometimes it isn't mentioned.",

The coach mentioned it the last game for the first time ever and i notice it almost every game.. Chil Ku makes 10 wrong passes and 2 good ones. Same with Lee Dae Hoon actually. I get that both players also clear and intercept a lot of balls in the midfield, but those incidents are mostly due to their own mistakes\ud83d\ude05 every time it happens it reminds me of the starting days of season 2 where every possible counterattack  or build up ended with a wrong pass.\nDecisions on Jang Gun, Tae Bum and Hyung Taik were obviously correct IMO. Also i doubt that Yo Han will come back again. Obviously i hope he recovers from his injury but man oh man 90% of the times he played he received ridiculous goals and single-handedly made the team lose. \nI dont know thats just my two cents about everything right now.",

He is also flexible that he can play in multiple positions in the midfield. Good at dead ball situation too.\n\n* Chil-ku is comfortably the best defensive midfielder in the team. His positioning is good, his stamina is good, and he tussles well despite not being a big player. His passing is actually not bad at all. Unfortunately, the wingers are often still playing like amateurs where they waited for the ball while Chil-ku often looks for empty space to exploit with the pass (where the wingers should be running towards to, but often not).\n\n\nBoth of them are comfortably in the starting XI.",

He has some good passes and has been integral in some of their build-up plays. \n\nIt just that the editing typically only highlights the moment when striker receives the ball and scores. Or if the play doesn't go well then the editing highlights the mistake which is his missed pass.\n\nTBH his position is a highly unappreciated position where he doesn't get praised for doing his job well but draws all the flak for mistakes.\n\nIt also seems like the thing that Ahn Jung Hwan said about \"passing into space vs passing to player\" is the very first time Chilku ever heard about that. I think with this enlightenment, his passing will be much better.",

I guess Se Ho and So Min do really have a lot of similarities.. !&lt;\n\nOh., &gt;!and after comparing with recent episodes., I guess Ji Hyo is more active when there are three or two people including her in a group.. Like the one with Jae Suk and Seok Jin at the market and with Se Chan in these latest episodes.. Only based what on I think though.. Honestly though., I couldn't enjoy many episodes past years because I kept thinking the entire duration of the episodes whether she would spoke something longer on each episode other than \"Thanks for the food\".. But now I kind of moved on from that phase..!&lt;\n\nEdit:&gt;! The stubble and the wig were really fitting Jong Kook at the photoshoot scene.. He looked really cool there..!&lt;",

Everyone are busy bantering each other and she just can't get in, she is slow talker, unless someone prompt her, most of the time she end just listening to them.\n\nAnd feels like Ji Hyo has only like less than a minute screentime at 2nd half of the episode. Feels bad for her tbh, but the others are just great at talking.",

And it's the only reason why they actually got the screentime, because he pointed it out and brought it to the attention of everyone else. He can't make jihyo take advantage of the opportunity and speak up when the spotlight is on her though.",

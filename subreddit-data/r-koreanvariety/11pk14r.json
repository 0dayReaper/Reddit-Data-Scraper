I assume they all already know each other (they are the group of friends Hyeri mentioned at the beginning), because if they didn't, they hit it off pretty quickly. \n\nI felt like the Music challenge was too difficult, to only go by hints like \"girl group song from 2017\" as if there aren't so many groups promoting at least 3-4 songs a year each... yeah, not all of them will have a producer tag/signature sound at the beginning, but still, how are you supposed to remember what got released which year, unless you're Hyeri, of course. If only she was able to guess her own turn with such ease \ud83d\ude02\n\nI'm definitely glad to see Leejung back on tv, she has great variety skills and her faces and reactions are endless meme material.",

I think they could have used a pro, someone like Lee Eunji, to keep the vibe going through the whole show. Yena should help a lot when she arrives. I wonder if Hyeri is feeling pressure being the oldest vs her more fun and chaotic maknae days. This seems similar to Yujin having the pressure and responsibility of being the IVE leader who can't terrorize her members vs. the devilishly annoying and devious maknae on *Earth Arcade*.",

The 4th generation idols are a lot less fake and a lot freer than the preceding generations, especially the offshoots of IZ\\*one. Look at Le Sserafim, Ive or Young Ji, those girls are just batshit crazy from time to time. Chaewon and Yena have been a hoot together since their IZ\\*one days even without Yuri. My guess is Hyeri isn't fully adjusted yet, she's from a time when there was always at least a man in the mix, because, you know, women can't do it themselves (/faceplam), so she's used to have to follow his lead... I'm so glad they're past that, at least in part. I had a blast watching Earth Arcade and I think HyeMiLeeYeChaePa will be a lot a fun too especially since the rest of the cast is incredibly good indeed, Miyeon is a discovery for me, She's effortlessly hilarious.",

They are literally in an empty room with no direction for long periods of time.  \n  \nIf they had challenges they could tackle on their own (building their own furniture or decorating for example), there would be an activity and a focus for them to interact over. Since they don't have the money to furnish the place, and I'm assuming their stuff will arrive assembled and not in IKEA form, the lack of objectives or items between game sessions are bound to be slower.  \nEven for the one activity they did have access to, cooking, all they could afford was Ramen. Not much you can do with that either.  \nSomething like \"complete this chore before the next game session to earn (prize)\" would keep them busy and create content.  \n  \nIt's just getting started, so perhaps there will be more content from their downtime in the future as the household starts to come together.  \nThere will be more things to do and as they are more comfortable with the house and setting, they should open up more.",

Comparing to EA, the girls were constantly busy playing games or dancing amongst themselves while waiting for the next game from the PD. Yena is pretty good at coming up with daft ideas and making fun content, so I expect the show to pick up in the next episode.",

Miyeon you can even see by her inability to complete a dance before running and ducking for cover. XD  \n  \nHyeri is shameless enough, but she also feels responsibility here, so she may be holding back a little. She'll play off what's going on, but like I said, not much going on.  \n  \nI haven't seen much of Leejung or any of Patricia (she kind of came out of nowhere for me), so I can't really say. Leejung has two sides, but I've seen more of her serious side than her fun side, so not sure how she'll be yet.  \n  \nWith Earth Arcade, they were basically on vacation outside of the games, so their downtime was funtime. They didn't have to worry about acquiring toilet paper and the like and they had music, computers, furniture, props, etc.  \nStill, that casting was simply strong. Mimi was the only relatively calm presence, but most of the time she just got swept along with the others. The other 3 were simply non-stop and completely shameless. It was all chaos all the time, to the point that even the staff were just like \"are you ever going to rest?\".  \nNa PD is also a character in his shows and it adds something for the cast to play off. He's entertaining in his own right.  \n  \nIt's more normal to have a show with ebbs and flows than what EA turned out like. I wouldn't set the bar that high, but it's reasonable to expect it will improve with Yena and more progress/time together.",

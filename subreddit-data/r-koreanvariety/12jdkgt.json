I found the episode with the most \u201cGenius\u201dly feel was the episode 2, because that episode included a main game and a checkout game (I think in the Genius it was called the death match) and both games were really good (Note: &gt;! Unlike in the Genius, here not every round has a checkout game!&lt;. I also liked the game in episode 4, but I felt &gt;!once someone was able to decode the right order, the game can end very quickly because everybody was sharing the information each other openly!&lt;. Also interesting is the &gt;!revival game of the eliminated. Will it be a short game or a longer one with the additional challenge of the cold weather.!&lt;",

For example in the forth episode it took more than an hour until the game even started, then \\~35min of the game, plus 20 min of aftermath and previews. So the game was only a third of the episode!&lt;\n\n&gt;!\\- I thought the time-concept would be interesting, but I feel it didn't play much of a role so far. It could've just as easily been coins or something. With the 24h they get every day, it kind of doesn't really matter that the currency is time specifically!&lt;\n\n&gt;!But nevertheless I was quite invested and even got quite emotional at the end of the third episode after Chloe and Layone had to face off!&lt;",

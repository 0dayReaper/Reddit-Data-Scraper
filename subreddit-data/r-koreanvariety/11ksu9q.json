            "comment": "A knee ride like that is Day 1 grappling stuff.  It's extremely effective against someone with very little to no grappling experience whatsoever, and you can control whether or not you want it to simply be a nullifying position, or increase pressure making it not only painful but very disruptive to the recipient's breathing.\n\nThe move on it's own?  Can't really complain about it.  But I think most people (including mine) took issue to what that move was front-loaded with.  He's the one that cut an interview talking himself up and saying \"if you know MMA, you know who I am\".  Then when he's in a position to handpick his opponent, he not only goes for a woman - albeit the most physically imposing in the traditional sense almost as if he was trying to make a point - but one with no wrestling experience whatsoever.  For someone with such a high opinion of himself, he certainly took the easiest road he possibly could.  \n YMMY, but it really felt like he was out to prove some kind of point, and his smug reactions to the rest of the cast clearly not impressed with him really drove that point home.\n\nIt wasn't the knee-ride as such, it was everything \\*around\\* the knee-ride that just made it/him look bad.  I can guarantee you that wouldn't have lasted five seconds if he'd selected a woman who knew what to do against that like Eun-Sil... but he was clearly never going to do that.",

Not saying there aren't people who took issue with the move, but the majority of the people are disgusted with how he conducted himself. Chun Li herself she wasnt bothered by the knee, that she would have done the same, but the lack of good attitude was what was pissing everyone off.",

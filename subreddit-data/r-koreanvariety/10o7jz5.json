    "postText": "On the 27th, Kim Gura attended a public hearing on the revision of the copyright law which was shown on his YouTube channel ['Guracheol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQZrFCTunbg&amp;lc=UgxeYhgUqgdSeO1rtfJ4AaABAg.9lOniMspfR29lTRkngJA_C&amp;ab_channel=%EA%B5%AC%EB%9D%BC%EC%B2%A0)'! . In the released video, Kim Gu-ra said, \"The National Assembly is holding a public hearing related to the earnings of celebrities from OTT Platforms\". In the case of celebrities, they earn a lot of money through reruns shown on television. However, in the case of OTT, fees for reruns (ex- infinity challenge on wavve and yoo quiz on the block on youtube i guess?) are not paid. In addition,  additional revenue generated by reusing YouTube content is also not paid to celebrities appearing on these videos.\n\nAfterwards, Kim Gura met Ji-hoon Jeon of the Korea Broadcasting Performers' Rights Association, named Kim Gu. Jeon Ji-hoon said, \u201cI analyze the actual data, and you can see that Kim Gu-ra is almost second in terms of cumulative collections within our association.\u201d Hearing this, Kim Gu-ra was delighted and said, \"Am I that much?\" He then asked, \"Who is number one?\" Jeon Ji-hoon said, \"It is Yoo jae Suk.\"\n\nAlso, surprisingly, the third person is either shin dong yeop or jun hyun moo.\n\n[source](https://tenasia.hankyung.com/tv-drama/article/2023012889544)\n\nedit-\n\n**TLDR: Most Viewed Celebrities In Reruns Aired in OTT Platforms -1) Yoo Jae Suk 2) Kim Gura 3) Shin Dong Yeop/Jun Hyun Moo. Celebrities dont get a cent from these reruns. They only get money from reruns shown on TV. So, for example, running man members then dont receive any money from running man youtube channel. but probably they receive money from reruns of the show on tv. Recently, National Assembly considering ammendment to OTT Laws.**",

But yeah, I don't expect it. Also Kim Gura is not expected for me too.",

And if they able to get a law approved to get them paid for old content stream, i expected those Korean broadcast station to start deleting bunch of videos online rather than pay the artist.\n\nAlso based on the list:\n\n&gt;1) Yoo Jae Suk 2) Kim Gura 3) Shin Dong Yeop/Jun Hyun Moo\n\nThose almost always are the MCs and have guests or other cast with them, so if these Replay views law are in effect. Those artist would also get their share of that revenue",

Perhaps that is the reason they ranked so high in the list.",

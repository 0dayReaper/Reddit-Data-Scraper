    "postText": "South Korea's first gay reality series is getting a second season! \n\nHis Man 2 is set to air on June 23rd on Wavve.  \n\nThe second season will highlight 'other people's love', which is more intense than the first season. Singer-songwriters, DJs, and college students from prestigious American universities appear on the program to find love that thrills their hearts. In particular, among them, one performer confessed that his ex had appeared in 'His Man' and is expected to draw attention.\n\n[Season Teaser](https://youtu.be/eJcW--SuIy4)\n\n[Source - Article](https://m.sports.khan.co.kr/view.html?art_id=202306070901003&amp;sec_id=540201)",

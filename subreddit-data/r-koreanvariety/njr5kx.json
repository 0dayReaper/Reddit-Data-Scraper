    "postText": "Not a single bad episode since the beginning of the year. Episode 556 in my view is one of the funniest Running Man episodes of all time, and I say this as a person who has watched all 556 episodes multiple times. Even the worst episode was on par with the best of the 2015-2020 period in my view. As a lifelong fan of Running Man who has seen all 556 episodes multiple times and have judged each and every one of them discreetly, I can honestly say Running Man has not had a better PD than Bo Pil since the original today. While he was rough at the beginning, he has grown into his role and successfully brought back Running Man to the old days while adding his unique flair. He is better than Myuk PD, Chul Min, all of them. He is on track, in my view, to become the best PD Running Man has ever had if SBS allows him to keep his course over the show. While I certainly agree that Kwang Soo\u2019s departure will leave a hole in the show and the timing is unfortunate, I believe Running Man will not only survive, but thrive without him, because of Bo Pil PD\u2019s consistency in delivering killer after killer episode. And hopefully, in the future, if he is physically able and wishes to come back, then he will only add to the show\u2019s return to brilliant form. It\u2019s the glory days of Running Man all over again because of Bo Pil PD. Bo Pil PD Fighting!",

Including LKS departure now. \n\nI really want to see him flex and the crew once the restrictions are lifted.",

The thing about BPD is he's making hilarious episodes with what he's had available.  \n  \nChul Min achieved incredible feats during his time, they might not have been the funniest but he pulled off the fan meet and all of the current gen overseas projects.  \n  \nHe's being dealt another raw deal with LKS departure, but I REALLY liked Sechan this week, I think with more screen time he'll flourish under BPD, as will the rest of the cast. I hope we get to keep BPD for a long time.",

I know that they usually have fan meets in other countries and don't record it, but given the (well-deserved) adulation they receive there I wouldn't be surprised if they decided to make the Philippines trip into another fan meet series.

Who ever think on making 2 episodes of basically the member just sitting down in front of computer and play with the stock market and still making it one of the best RM episode ever. He is a gem, he knows the cast strengths and weaknesses very well and use this as a base for all of the episodes.  In the past one year Bo Pil already shows his amazing growth and I can\u2019t wait where he will bring RM towards. Tbh, I can see Na Pd and KTH Pd in him. He have such a snarky yet friendly persona, but at the same time very wholesome and innocent. If Bo Pil and the whole RM cast didn\u2019t win an award this year, I would be super disappointed. I think they definitely deserved it this year. He is on a roll.",

I even have a theory why the Brave Girls episode was lackluster/recycled, it was a last minute booking. The production crew had to scramble to generate a whole episode on a whim. Brave Girls was molten hot at the time and maybe higher ups want to jump on the hype as soon as possible and they managed to squeak in their schedule at the last minute. Anyway this is just a theory of mine since the episode before and the one after was great. It was a weird outlier. \n\nThe heartsignal episode, the latest episode, the quiz episode, etc it's just oozing with creativity. He also knows that letting the members just banter is awesome to fans. Runningman is back to my number show to watch. It's hard to find a new spark on a 11 yr old show. It's just too bad it's the pandemic and Kwangsoo is leaving. I would have loved to see Bopil properly flex his creative muscle.",

I love those 2 episodes!!\n\nBut last weeks episode were kind of dull as they tried hard to make it work but sometimes the simple things are better. Like when they just talk and tease each other rather than solving mysteries and all that.",

I get you probably have way too much free time but you don't have to write paragraphs to argue everyone who disagrees with you. Besides, it's not gonna change my mind. I don't dislike Bopil, but I definitely think everyone hypes him way too much even though he hasn't done anything impressive nor anything new. The members are doing everything and he gets all the credit\n\nedit: just skimmed your last paragraph and JSJ is only considered funny these days because the members are helping him stand out, not because of Bopil",

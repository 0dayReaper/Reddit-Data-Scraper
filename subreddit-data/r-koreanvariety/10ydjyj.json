    "postText": "I was binge watching Hangout With Yoo and we cant deny, the special projects, Ssak3, Refund Sisters and MSG/WSG Wannabe were all successful. They can also include Yoo San Seul and Yoo Go Star. They can also bring Toyote(whatever happened to that project, felt like they want to do something then stopped and didnt bring it up again, covid related?)\n\nDue to Covid, Hangout with Yoo needs to change its approach, have to end or not proceed to intended plan. Although MSG/WSG performed, the other groups cant or did not. \n\nShould MBC try to hold one? or its too early?(early because they probably thinking of making another one?)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/10ydjyj)",

There are times he let them try and be chaotic but without him helming, they felt flat. \n\nI also think YJS and the show is doing their best to have that natural chemistry on screen. Hope everyone figure that out.\n*(Younger ones too need to stop being awkward to Jun Ha hyung)*",

I have to watch 161 - 171 still.",

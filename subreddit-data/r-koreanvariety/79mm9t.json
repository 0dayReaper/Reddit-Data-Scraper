Warning! Some might find this disturbing or uncomfortable even though it doesn't show the moment of impact. It shows how his car stopped in the middle of moving traffic then suddenly sped off as he swerved off to the side where the crash happened (which is not visible in this footage). What is clear is this is no normal accident, it's looking very likely that it is indeed a heart attack that led to him losing control of his car as he desperately tried to move out of traffic.",

But yeah given the speed it slowed down to and the gear he would have been in for that road, car would have either stalled or not pulled away at the speed that it did.\n\nWhat is going to be interesting to know is whether the cause of death was from the heart attack, or from his injuries in the accident. Maybe his heart attack was fatal anyway.",

I'd personally claim it doesn't save lives in rare case situations but just in general it promotes more active driving and allows more all round control of the car. Things that help prevent accidents in the first place. But again feel that discussion doesn't suit this particular case as it doesn't appear to be the case of driver error. ",

I'd wager the vast majority of people in my country (The Netherlands) does not even know what 'understeer' is, let alone what to do when they experience it. The same goes for many more relatively basic dynamics that could easily save lives if understood.",

Second, the Running Man cast are not mere acquaintances of the late Kim Joo Hyuk, so even if the production staff were to decide to continue filming, it'd be hard for the cast to properly do their job. Third, there'd be a lot of backlash from a traditionally conservative nation if they ever decide to air whatever they have filmed prior to the news since it involves Lee Yoo Young. \n\nThe best course of action would be to scrap the episode and then reschedule filming, most likely with a different guest.\n\nOf course condolences will be made here, I don't see why they wouldn't bring that up in future episodes, but to just deliver condolences and a moment of silence and then air the planned episode as if nothing happened is a tad bit distasteful, disrespectful, and insensitive.",

Filming for \u201cRunning Man\u201d was halted.\n\nA representative of Lee Yoo Young said, \u201cAfter she heard the news of his passing, she asked repeatedly if it was true that he passed. We are currently trying to verify facts.\u201d\n\nLee Yoo Young and Kim Joo Hyuk started publicly dating in December of 2016 after meeting while filming director Hong Sang Soo\u2019s film \u201cYourself and Yours\u201d (literal title). Last month, Kim Joo Hyuk mentioned her in an interview and revealed he was thinking about marrying her and wanting a daughter.\n\nAround 4 p.m. on October 30, Kim Joo Hyuk\u2019s car flipped over in Seoul\u2019s neighborhood of Samseong. According to police, Kim Joo Hyuk was driving his car on Yeongdong Street when he crashed into a car nearby. Then, Kim Joo Hyuk\u2019s car swerved onto the sidewalk, crashed into the wall of an apartment, and fell down the stairs before flipping over.\n\nKim Joo Hyuk was the only person in the car at the time of the accident. He was rescued from the car and taken to Konkuk Hospital but passed away.\n\nSource: https://www.soompi.com/2017/10/30/running-man-filming-halts-kim-joo-hyuks-girlfriend-lee-yoo-young-learns-passing/",

A possible side effect for Adipam is heart attack, but it is extremely rare. A dermatologist of 30 years said he never seen this side effect. Cause of death is due to trauma to the head from hitting the apartment walls. Adipam can cause drowsiness and sluggishness though.\n\nSource: https://twitter.com/OH_mes/status/925571747411365888",

It can cause drowsiness though, which is why people usually sleep like a log after they take allergy medications.\n\n But a Soompi article recently say that it is unlikely that the late Joo Hyuk was sleepy, because the pattern of the car stopping and accelerating did not match or something. I don't know really. When I read that it was a heart attack I was really sad, but now that the cause of the accident is up to speculation again it just made me restless and wonder. \n\nHe touched a lot of people's hearts, and I'm sure everyone wants to know what really happened :(",

Anyway, a huge loss, it took me awhile to warm up to him on 2d1n, but when I did, I saw that he was just a genuine, gentle and honest man. I have my own theories of what happened, one is far out there, that most people would think absolutely insane, anyway, speculating at this point is just disrespectful, stay safe guys.",

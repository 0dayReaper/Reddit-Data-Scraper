    "postText": "# Description\n\n&gt; Love Catcher is a show featuring a group of men and women coming together for love or money. In this event, men and women who do not know each other will live in the same house. But before moving into the house, participants must choose between two identities: 'Love Catcher' or 'Money Catcher'. Later, 'Money Catcher' was seen forming sincere relationships with other 'Love Catchers'. On the other hand, 'Money Catcher' can win almost $50,000 if they can become a couple with 'Love Catcher' at the end of the show. When making romantic advances, there's an added mood of caution as participants can only guess who's there for love or money. \n\n# Panel\n\n* Jang Do Yeon\n* Joo Woo Jae\n* Jun Hyun Moo\n* Gabee\n* Kim Yo Han\n\n# Cast\n\nMale Participants\n* Park Yong Ho - [@hoho_dragon](https://www.instagram.com/hoho_dragon/)\n* Cho Seong Beom - [@laul_sb](https://www.instagram.com/laul_sb/)\n* Park Jung Hyun - [@junghyuniiii](https://www.instagram.com/junghyuniiii/)\n* Kim Yoon Soo Ro - [@kimyunsuro](https://www.instagram.com/kimyunsuro/)\n* Kwak Tae Hyeok - [@kwak_taehyeok](https://www.instagram.com/kwak_taehyeok/)\n\nFemale Participants\n* Kim Hyo Jin - [@h3_1o](https://www.instagram.com/h3_1o/)\n* Hwang Soo Ji - [@t_110771](https://www.instagram.com/t_110771/)\n* Lee Yu Jeong - [@ririyujeong](https://www.instagram.com/ririyujeong/)\n* Choi Tae Eun - [@c.taeeun](https://www.instagram.com/c.taeeun/)\n* Hong Seung Yeon - [@applemang0o](https://www.instagram.com/applemang0o/)\n\n\n# Episode Links\n\n|Info|Link|Notes|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|RAW|[Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rG4y127HB/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click)||\n|Stream|[VIU](https://www.viu.com/ott/sg/en-us/vod/468617/Love-Catcher-in-Bali)|^(ENG SUB)|\n|Softsub|[Download](https://link.emediaarts.net/lovecatcherinbali/lcib-episode-6)|^(ENG SUB)|\n\n\n# Previous Discussions\n\n\n|Episode(s)|\n|:-:|\n|[01](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yyjiu2/love_catcher_in_bali_e01_221118/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [02](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z487z3/love_catcher_in_bali_e02_221125/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [03](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zafwqf/love_catcher_in_bali_e03_221202/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [04](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zn8wt2/love_catcher_in_bali_e04_221216/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)|\n|[05](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zta8sb/love_catcher_in_bali_e05_221223/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)|\n\n___\nTHE DISCUSSION BELOW MAY CONTAIN ***SPOILERS***",

How could she think Yong Ho is MC and not be suspicious of Seong Beom at all? Everything Seong Beom's done until now is just screaming Money. But MC or not, his flirting is just not for me, cringe af. But seems like it's working on Soo Ji though, so it's fair i guess...\n\nMy Yong Ho - Hyo Jin ship is crashing and sinking even deeper now. He just outright rejected her in front of the whole casts just to get some attention from Soo Ji. How is talking to a wall is 'good communication', she literally turned away from you!\n\nTae Hyeok is the star of this episode, if he wasn't too straightfoward during his early days, i think he would have more chances with Yu Jeong. It's a shame that he didn't realize it until now.\n\nPoor Tae Eun she was so anxious during the game. And that anxiety will not be resolved anytime soon, hopefully Soo Ro can be calm after knowing her identity.\n\nThere have never been 2 days 1 night trips before throughout **Love Catcher** seasons. I like it, but still before this there's only one 1v1 date, seems a bit rushed.\n\nNo elimination, good job PD nims!",

And I think the last scene also proved Soo Ji is probably a money catcher for the following reasons:\n\n\\- the 2 persons she has interest in are YongHo and SungBum. These are the only 2 persons she would be interested to know their identities, whether she is MC (to capture a LC) or LC (to avoid a MC);\n\n\\- picking the person asking the final question was therefore a strong power and she knew it obviously (everyone kept repeating it even when it was her turn to pick the last picker);\n\n\\- if she were a LC, she would have picked the last questioner in a way to increase the chances that it would help her finding out about YongHo or SungBum: for example, if she had wanted to disclose YongHo identity, she would have given the last question power to HyoJin - or to SungBum. To disclose SungBum identity, she could simply give the power to YongHo. No risk taken, only potential benefits.\n\nBUT here is the thing: she could not take the risk of giving this power to HyoJin, SungBum or YongHo because these people were also likely to pick HER. And she could not risk it.\n\nIn short, she HAD to push the power far from her own circle of people (people she like + people that like the people she likes). She had to make a choice among the persons that she was sure would have no interest in asking HER the last question: TaeHyeok, TaeEun, YuJeong, JungHyun, SooRo.\n\nShe could not pick SooRo who asked her directly \"are you a MC?\" earlier the same day and said (jokingly or not) \"yes\" so it was too risky\n\nAnd among the remaining few, she probably felt that the person who truly had no connection to her was TaeHyeok, hence her choice.\n\nNot only this was no coincidence but I believe it was a very smart move from Soo Ji in my opinion. All this played under the cute giggle/innocent look of \"I don't even know what I am doing right now, I am just picking someone without thinking hihihihi\". Nah, I think this woman is smarter than she wants us to believe.\n\nPS: the way Tae Hyeok spat when he heard the 2% had me rolling on the floor",

TE-SR chemistry does not compare to any other ships currently, but the panel keeps on forcing the almost non-existent chemistry of SR-SY instead. The scene where SR rested his head on TE's lap was so cute but of course the panel just had to ruin the mood. Anyway anyhow I'll be rooting for TE-SR!",

He mentioned that the prize of $50,000 was approximately a year's salary that could be earned in 10 days (the duration of the show), and it was therefore understandable if people want to be money catchers.\n\nI also believe SJ is a money catcher.  She took some time to incorrectly conclude that YH is also a money catcher and therefore turned her back to him.  Might be wrong about this, but I think a love catcher might not be so concerned about being matched with a money catcher - it is just a risk taken to find true love.  But a money catcher would be very concerned about accidentally picking another money catcher.",

Wanted Hyojin to ask Yongho if he was a love catcher (he was begging for it too, lol) after that 2% chance of being swayed answer, mdr tabarnak. \n\nLike was sorta miffed during that time since people kept going back and forth instead of asking different people. But ya, I was almost like Taehyeok's reaction, lmao. Puffed air everywhere.\n\nWhat if it did go to Taeeun, how would she have answered it. She's cool but you could feel her anxiety, she might've had a panic attack.\n\nYongho is almost for sure gloating already with being a love catcher. But would that have like strengthened Hyojin's resolve.\n\n----\n\nHonestly fam, if I didn't know Hyojin's Instagram/social media spoilers and so on, I would be a bit hopeful still.\n\nThe what ifs and different timelines. Can already feel the angst/melancholy/etc. with the upcoming Heart Signal 4 or some other dating shows. \n\nBut this Love Catcher in Bali situation is so wild too. How do Yoonsuro and Taeeun just click so well, like same in Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774). Except this time the post-show is likely different.\n\nOr how the hell did Jeonghyeon seemingly never do anything but cook? Is he in Single's Inferno, wtf? \n\nSome coincidences or setups be so funny.\n\nThought Jeonghyeon was gonna be chill during the previews/trailers as he looked like an idol. But then when the age reveal and such happened, I thought he'd possibly be more forward or assertive.\n\nBut then the Hyojin x Jeonghyeon timeline (after that sparkling white photoshoot scene) never really happened outside of prepping meals and so on. Is it because he sensed Hyojin is a money catcher or something. Sigh, they were the visuals couples too, right.\n\nOr what if Yoonsuro wasn't in play, it would've almost for sure been Taeeun x Jeonghyeon.\n\nNot gonna lie though, my mans Yoonsuro is living the noona romance dreams. He just wakes up, gets on the floor, and casually puts his head on his noona's thigh, like how crazy is that. And she pats his head too. Getting flashbacks here.\n\nNext movement, wow, it coincides with Baby Monster (\ubca0\uc774\ube44\ubaac\uc2a4\ud130, new girl group from YG) introduction video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYyUpQ_veL4\n\nWishing TVING/etc. would release some behind the scenes or extra clips. Need more context/content. We never see some castmates interact with each other. Wonder how it was.\n\nSome people say it'd be crueler if Love Catcher was longer. But imagine it gets more than 8 or so episodes or like they stay together for 1 month. It's more effort for the money catcher, like Seongbeom said it's a year's worth. \n\nBut if they have the right cast (with them visuals, specs) available, hopefully PDnims extend it to say 2 weeks or so. And that they change the activities and so on, as ya some people want it to be done differently. Personally I'm okay with everything (remove elimination/etc. please) as long as it's still got that nice slice of life view. \n\nLike I wonder what they're gonna do for the upcoming matched couple dates.\n\nThere better be a season 5 of Love Catcher. Like holy fam, Love Catcher is just so underrated. For the concept, idea. The timing is so key.\n\nWhat if Netflix picked up Love Catcher instead of producing Single's Inferno. Sigh. Alternate dimensions.",

So is stands to reason that she responded negatively to YH being out with HJ and super positively to SB's clearly MC level advances the same night. \n\nBut don't worry, she'll swing back to YH when he makes another attempt, then over to SB an hour later when he stands briefly outside her room.\n\nIn the end I think the best outcome is for her to pick SB and have him be an MC, at least that way she might learn something about herself.",

Hyo Jin (Reason: have sudden interest in Yong Ho after seeing him read a book ep2/3 which made her feel he is LC, hence made her certain to go for him. Furthermore all the recent actions shows YH to be a 1 girl type of man which makes HJ even more certain he isn\u2019t probably the MC as if so MC man might keep more options. Furthermore, HJ is probably not going for JH as the chef seems like someone who might be a MC If not for the fact that there are only 3 MC at the moment, JH would be on my MC suspect list)\n\n3. Kim Yoonsuro (Reason: SR gives me MC vibes. Up till the reveal, was pretty sure TE was a LC as she seems to express herself pretty straightforward, transparent and based on her job, you would think she is seeking Love which I feel SR might think as well. Not only could he vibe with her, if she is a LC, he could win 50k which is a really big sum for someone his age. But at the same time in recent episodes, he is also cautious because if she is an MC, it would mean that feelings fake and not only that he would lose the 50k. I think if given a chance SR might have kept more options but it would seem weird as each set of girls already has their match and he kinda has no vibe with SY - very 1 sided irregardless of whether SY is MC or LC)\n\nLove Catcher (LC) breakdown:\n1. Taehyeok (TH) just very straight up with his feelings all to YJ. Very considerate\n2. Yujeong (YJ) A little sus at first but I think she is also quite focused just on Jonghyun only,\n3. Seung Yeon (SY). Just likes SR\n4. SJ, SB, YH love triangle\n\nLove triangle:\nContrary to most, I feel YH, SJ and SB love triangle are all Love Catchers. SB might be pretty cringey and give off bad boy vibes but the fact the competition for SJ by SB &amp; YH seems so petty and jealous kinda indicates to me SB isn\u2019t money catcher. SB is just a man with ego who wants to be around SJ all the time. And YH probably likes SJ because of her flirty young and sweet vibes. \n\n5. Jung Hyun (JH): quite focused on HJ now although YJ keeps hinting. I feel like JH might waver and weigh options if he is a MC but since there is only 3 MC, I would think the MC is more of SR than JH)",

I didn\u2019t know how to feel when he was first sitting there outside but he\u2019s grown on me like a rash. Him spitting his drink out and then continuing to laugh with head in hand after while they were moving on just about killed me.

YJ - hot, sxy, but mature and sensible (she is totally missing out on TE), well settled/bright future\n4. SY - fun, one she can gel with.. she is too young and i think she just wants to explore her life (date have fun), would be more open to experimenting\n\n5.TE - she is at that age where she will know what she wants and likes..( i also wonder how she and TH would have been)",

Like why do I keep falling for it, fml.\n\nFor example, during that last party night scene, there's already like one couple that are (still) dating (so many (not really) subtle pictures together) and so the questions probably wouldn't have mattered.

So for a lot of Korean variety shows (and dating shows) they actually have Korean/Hangul subtitles embedded in the video, but ya no English/etc. subs. You can use OCR (like Google Translate) to kinda translate the Korean subs to English/etc. but it's a tiring way to watch as you have to keep pausing and so on.\n\nThankfully these days Viki and VIU and so on will usually have English subs for (dating) shows within say 24 hours or so. \n\nBut ya you can also use Bilibili if you know how to read Chinese characters (through OCR, there's Pleco/etc. for Chinese characters) as they often have Chinese characters or subtitles for it in Mandarin/etc.\n\n**Usually VIU/etc. will release English subs around 3:00AM EST (New York Time) or so, like early Saturday morning**. Don't forget to convert it to your time zone.\n\nOtherwise there's no English subs yet. Actually some machine translated subs should be available around the same time (3:00AM EST) but early Friday morning. \n\nLike check the tteokbeokki/noonaspoiler site as they generally have that machine translated subs for some of the shows that are not officially subbed and also those that have no fansubs yet. These days it seems it's iheartu2 from Twitter/Youtube and some folks here from /r/koreanvariety that will do the fansubs.\n\nIf you want to watch early (with(out) machine translated subs) or so before the proper English subs, check these threads for more info on where to watch Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zqf0dp/singles_inferno_2_ep_3_4_20221220/j147u12/ and **https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/ &lt;--- check this link for where to watch other dating shows.**\n\nThis thread has the different names of streaming/OTT services (like TVING, Coupang Play, wavve, etc.) or websites and the various Youtube channels and links for where to watch some of these dating shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yktjg9/can_anyone_suggest_some_kdating_shows/iuvbg43/\n\n**Check this link for somewhat updated and consolidated thread links**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zx36d6/who_are_the_legendary_or_iconic_cast_members_of/j2094j5/",

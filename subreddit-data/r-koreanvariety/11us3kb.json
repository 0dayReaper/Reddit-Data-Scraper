From the comments, it seems like they're also willing to retime the subtitles if it's not in sync and they posted the non-Viki/KOCOWA/etc. links too, so easy viewing.\n\nThat lineup has famous idols and so on with solid fandom, somebody's bound to post it if the other people forget. Some posters will time the discussion threads so that it's right before the new episode premiere, so like several hours more for Episode Two now. Or some posters from Asia/etc. will post the threads say 12/24 hours in advance so that it's available ahead of their sleeping schedule, before Viki/etc. subs it, and so on.\n\nFor Viki, they sometimes take 24 hours or so to fully sub an episode. Some other streaming services these days will have the English subs released simulcast (same time) or several hours later.",

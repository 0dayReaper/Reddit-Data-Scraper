            "comment": "It was a good game, all around but opened up the weakness of both teams.\n\nFitness issue is so apparent for Super League teams They can't seem to handle a full game. Is it because they lack playing time compared to Challenge League teams? When you look at FC Balladream and FC Top Girl (promoted teams) and the rest of the CL teams, they looked more than able to handle the whole game. Is it because they played more games? Just looked at FC Gukdae who was the weakest in term of stamina (also skills). They were only able to pose any sort of competition for one half. Since each player skills and levels keep going up, any CL teams can go toe to toe with SL teams to make an interesting game.\n\nBall possession percentage was definitely on FC WorldClass side but seems like they could not finish them. Their lack of power kickers seems to make their attacking force one sided. No real threat from outside the box and free kick chances. This mean that they will always need to penetrate the opposing defence. Luckily their passing play was good to stretch the defensive line, but if the opposing teams decided to play tight and total defense like FC Anaconda, they will have a problem with scoring opportunity.\n\nThe opposite is evident here for FC Actionista. Other than outside or long range shot, they are not as scarier as previous season. HeIn is great but once the defense start to take away their long shots, the attacking capabilities is virtually non-existence. \n\nMistake causes goal opportunity. Eva consistent subpar passing and mistakes are very concerning. It looks like she regressing, and so was Kathy. Her goalkeeping skills from last season basically disappeared this season. Wondering if trauma from getting injured last season affecting her confidence this time. All those shots (even goal shots) were easily handled by her last season, but not this time. Disappointing performance from Kathy and Eva.",

She was easily top 3 GK last season and going for saves but now she looks like a rookie. Granted she had a hand injury this game but even the last game she was underwhelming. I do think maybe the injury is playing a part in her willingness to really go for the saves this season.",

Last season she would cut off the scoring pass almost immediately. Seogi and KyeongSeo would not stand a chance if Kathy played like last season. Remember last season she blocked all HeIn shots and they even played with only 4 players. Those shots from HeIn and HyeJung were easy shots that she can handle. Her timing for those long range shots were also off. The coach kept telling her to focus and looked at the ball carefully. If these problems is not remedied, they will have a problem handling BoKyung, FC TopGirl, next. BoKyung shot are even more accurate and powerful, along with her penetrating plays. Rina and Gandalf MiYoun can keep wreaking havoc in the goal box, because magically they are just there. It will definitely be a fun game. Choi Jin Chul Derby.",

                    "comment": "&gt;Fitness issue is so apparent for Super League teams They can't seem to handle a full game. \n\nThe thing is that most legacy SL teams (Action, Giants, Nat Fam) had multiple players change so it is not really the same team that got them to the SL in the first place.\n\nThe newer players have less stamina, poorer game sense, positioning and technique. The more experienced players will then need to pick up the slack by running more to cover. Hence burning more stamina. This result in poorer performance overall for the team.\n\n\n&gt;Is it because they lack playing time compared to Challenge League teams?\n\nI did a rough projection in the potential number of games played. Actually SL and CL teams at least play 3-4 games per season. The outlier being a CL #1 / #2 teams making a deep run in the SL. \n\n- CL #1: 5 - 7 games (3 in CL + 2 in SL group + 2 in SL KO)\n\n- CL #2: 4 - 8 games (3 in CL + 1 SL promotion + 2 in SL group + 2 in SL KO)\n\n- CL #3 / #4: 3 games\n\n- SL #1 / #2: 4 games (2 SL group + 2 in SL KO)\n\n- SL #3 / #4: 4 games (2 SL group + 1 in SL KO + 1 #3/4 placement)\n\n- SL #5: 3 games (2 SL group + 1 #5/6 placement)\n\n- SL #6: 4 games (2 SL group + 1 #5/6 placement + 1 CL relegation)\n\nSo actual game time for average SL / CL teams isn't vastly different. Perhaps it is that SL teams seem to have more lull period between games as compared to CL teams. Maybe the SL players aren't keeping the same frequency / pace of training and practices during the lull periods.",

Lacking only the finishing touch.\n\nPass accuracy needs to be worked on more but the players mindset of running the wings and spreading out the defense was nice.  Not a fan of when the players bunch up and the opposite of not running in to support players that need an outlet pass.\n\nOne thing I liked was both teams pressuring the players with the ball.  Naty was great at stealing balls and passes.  They need to do that more.  Take the risk of running to intercept passes rather sticking like glue because the plan in man-to-man defense.\n\nGotta love the Lee EulYong smack the head celebration.  Hahaha",

Other teams will not have a chance of playing build-up offense now, and this will prove to be a challenge for FC TopGirl if they play against each other which is very likely. Now we just need Eva to play better with no mistake and Kathy resurgence as a leading goalkeeper in the league.\n\nSaori and Naty will definitely to work on their finishing touch. This is necessary against Ayumi FC TopGirl, if they play against each other next. Even Irene FC Gucheok can give the Naori duo problem. These two goalkeepers are the best of the league right now. They can penetrate both teams defenses, but have to get past these GKs. It will be a fun match.",

DaYoung is speedy with some ball awareness but we haven't fully see her potential yet. Her fitness is not tested yet either. She did collapsed when EunJi FC Gukdae accidentally bumped her a bit in the last game. Hopefully a month of training will get her ready to play a role for FC TopGirl.",

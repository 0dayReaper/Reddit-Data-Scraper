    "postText": "I've been watching Physical 100 and Jeong Han Saem reminds me of an actor who I watched during ~2013-2020 period. For the life of me, I cannot remember his name or any dramas he was in. I have a faint idea of him wearing a chef's white uniform and red scarf around his neck but I'm not sure.\n\nEdit: I also recall him having a pointy chin.\n\nAny help is appreciated. https://imgur.com/bRiEACK.jpg",

Loved seeing some \u201cnew\u201d faces on RM too including Korean Zombie and Choi Do Hoo. I kinda wished it was a 2-episode one.\n\nI wish there was one more round of the rumble and more negotiations shown. Do Hoo was right, Korean Zombie ain\u2019t a funny man but somehow he\u2019s so amusing to watch since he\u2019s so out of his element. The episode just proves the value of agents for these folks haha.\n\nThere was a mention at the end for SBS Pure Fighters - is that another show featuring this guest line up because that would be pretty fun and interesting!",

Dong Hyun has changed a lot since the last time he was on RM, his jokes are spontaneous now and he was a good sport going along with the jokes about his old name. The draft negotiations are always funny. Jongkook is a beast holding off three people including one of the fighters. \n\nStill think the volleyball player draft episode still had an edge over this and a tad funnier bcos of Kim YeonKoung. The ladies were a bit muted here. Maybe they could have brought in female Korean UFC fighters too to balance things out a bit. But a good episode to watch nonetheless.",

But what you can do with 2 injured athlete and 1 athlete that preparing for his match is so limited. I mean having the guest hurt himself from existing injuries or making fighter draw himself from scheduled bout because being guest in TV program is not worth it. Especially for RunningMan if Choi Do Ho injured, PR team gonna have overwork time session if that happen. \n\nWell, Kim Dong Hyun sure is an expert in variety show now.",

He was pretty reserved so this is such a shock to me.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Poor Dooho and his divorce that no one knew. Thankfully it was not awkward haha.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Two words: Kim Bong. LOL.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Though I'm a little bit sad that the other RM members, especially JSM and SJH, were in the shadows because of the concept (IMO).!&lt;\n\nThe 4 guests were really entertaining overall and they fit well with the cast.

All the professional fighter guests were variety talented and genuinely looked like they were having fun, which is the most important. You'd think they'd be awkward or uninterested but they were just goofing off. Some were even returning Running Man guests so they were familiar with how the show works. \n\nThe talk segment at the beginning was really well done then the first game though a quiz was very funny. As usual, negotiations are wild. But this time the fighter guests scared their bosses lmao. I'm bummed they seemed to rush to the final game but the final game was really good as well. The nametag ripping didn't last for long but it was one of the most exciting ones in years. All the guests were enjoying the game so it's a win for everyone. \n\nThe penalty kick at the end was also a great way to finish off. I'm sure the guests also had a great time on Running Man. These remind me of the exciting classic Running Man episodes! I honestly liked this episode enough that I wished it was two parts. Ah well.",

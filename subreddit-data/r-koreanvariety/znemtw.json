    "postText": "I just finished watching season 1 and 2 of Transit love (EXchange) and i really really found a new hobby and obsession.. korean dating shows\n\nI never watched any dating show before not even western shows like that. Cause i really don't like romantic stuff, but after watching these, my mind totally changed. Now i want more of these kind of content. I even started following the members/cast of these seasons cause i really felt like i didn't know what to do next.. i felt empty, and i miss them already.. \n\nFor me the 2 seasons were insanely good, i someone that don't cry that easily couldn't stop doing that at the last episodes of both seasons. For me both seasons are equally good, most of the couples i shipped ended together so i was mostly happy, even tho i was uncomfortable and angry in some scenes lol, but that means that these shows really do affect me. \n\nSo.. i really want to watch more korean dating shows like that, even if it doesn't have the same premise or rules. Can you guys recommend me some korean dating shows as good or close like Transit Love?",

It\u2019s kind of like a couples therapy/dating show. It can definitely make you feel heart broken or angry but also give you butterflies and smiles. It really depends. But I feel like it\u2019s a possible reality check when you\u2019re in a rut in a relationship.\n\nAlong with heart signal and all the other Korean dating shows that were mentioned in this section (minus ramyun and chill cause I\u2019m not a fan of that one personally). I can total agree that I prefer Korean dating shows over American ones. There is just way to much drama and fighting in American reality tv and I refuse to watch it and soak in that negative energy. Which is why I will always choose Korean variety over American reality.\n\nAlso no matter what you watch, it\u2019s all heavily edited but they\u2019re still very good watches. ^^",

I dont think it's as heavy as Exchange but it's definitely fun to watch. I think S2 is the best but watching it from S1 is cool too if u have the time, u can see the changes on the premise of the show, although each seasons are not related.\n\nIf you are familiar with korean comedians and artists, theres a show that has a special place in my heart called, Love Me Actually. Its basically about a group of single korean men entertainer that starts a travelling club. They go on trips to diff places with another group of women in hopes to find love. Because the main casts are entertainers i find the show to be super hilarious but at the same time still has the charm of dating shows since the core premise is to find love. It might no be as serious as other dating show but if i were to describe the show in one word its pure wholesomeness.",

Its popularity has increased tremendously over the last year or two and now us dating show fans are super satiated with plenty of shows.\n\nUnfortunately, I will say that (both seasons of) Transit Love is probably the best of them all and it'll be hard for any other show to top that. \n\nHowever, some other popular ones that I always make sure to catch are:\n\n1 - Love Catcher (great premise)\n\n2 - Heart Signal (extended time frame so participants really get to know each other, and there are Korean &amp; Chinese versions)\n\n3 - I am Solo (more normal looking people who are truly there to find love, it has an awesome track record for marriages). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLesser known shows that I think are also fun are Pink Lie, Between Love and Friendship, Pick Me Pet Me, Love Mafia (only 1 ep subbed), and Love In (people date through avatars). \n\nI thought Change Days was okay, but could not stand the commentators in S2. And this is an unpopular opinion, but I think Single's Inferno is overhyped. It's only as popular as it is because it's on Netflix. Singles Inferno S1 was totally underwhelming to me, especially since I was coming off of Transit Love S1. Season 2 just started and seems better so far, but it's such a short time frame, it's difficult for me to imagine any of the participants are truly there to find love and not to become influencers. I'd still watch it, but don't expect it to be up to par with Transit!",

            "comment": "For Korean dating shows specifically, try **Heart Signal (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110)**, **Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c\ub77c\uc774)**, **Love Catcher (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98)**, etc. \n\nCheck the threads below for other Korean shows. For example, there's **Secret Man and Woman (\ube44\ubc00\ub0a8\ub140)**, a more low budget version of Pink Lie. And like **Between Love and Friendship (\uac01\uc790\uc758\ubcf8\ub2a5\ub300\ub85c)** has no panelists, and it's somewhat short at 6 episodes.\n\nFor getting married, there's **I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO (/r/IamSolo)**, it's more raw and fast-paced but there's actual marriages/couples/etc. from I Am Solo now. Probably because the housemates are older people (often late 20s to early 40s) and some of them actually want to get married for real.\n\n---\n\nOr actually here's some the recent Korean dating shows that appeared around the middle (before/around the summer) of 2022: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/wutb91/dating_shows_currently_airing/ilbxivd/. There's a lot of brand new Korean dating shows, check the other recent/newer threads below.\n\nThe above thread is from near the end of August 2022, and there's now also **Eden 2**, **Sleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774)**, **Chain Reaction (\uccb4\uc778\ub9ac\uc561\uc158)**, **Love Alarm: Clap! Clap! Clap!**, etc. \n\nCheck MyDramaList for updated info on the new 2022-2023 dating shows.\n\nFor shows that are more like variety shows with romance or like blind dates and so on, there's **Love Me Actually** (from 2019, it's like a travel club and they play games to compete for love), **Matching/Shopping Survival 1+1** (this may be unfocused/random/etc. in the first several episodes, but after a while it settles down the different expected parts of the show), oh and there's the new **Skip/\uc2a4\ud0b5** with Yoo Jaesuk and Jeon Somin, it's also like a blind date show.\n\nFor dating shows on Youtube that have Koreans and international people, there's also **Ramyun &amp; Chill** (from DKDKTV channel, Episode 1 and playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-QbAbV_8NI&amp;list=PLq0bxUK0D1KZp83qLQRKGvlVPIsUOdxjR), **3&amp;More** (from Blimey \ube14\ub77c\uc774\ubbf8 channel, Season 4, Episode 1 and playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8M1LEZ485w&amp;list=PLyfSAn8BP3bA2daCAa9G2TzeLSsDbtYRo), etc.\n\n---\n\nOh there was finally a modern Korean drama version of **UnREAL with Rachel or Shiri Appleby**. In UnREAL they show you how shows like The Bachelor and so on are produced, lol.\n\nThat Kdrama is called **Love is for Suckers** (has Lee Da-hee and Choi Si-won), it just finished two weeks ago. Kingdom of Love 2 (the dating reality show inside Love is for Suckers) is mainly based around probably I Am Solo and so on, like if you watch I Am Solo you'll see familiar stuff, references, et cetera.\n\nIf you want to skip the drama and go straight behind the curtain for how dating shows are made, start at Episode 5/6 as that's when they actually begin the Kingdom of Love 2 dating show, lol.\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iyso9ql/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iz8ayph/**\n\n**Check these threads for more info on where to watch Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zlml4b/ramyun_chill_episode_5_finale_221214/j06e2lh/\n\n---\n\nThere's actually other dating shows on Youtube now too from different countries/et cetera. These are Malaysian-Chinese/Singaporean/etc. dating shows, **Play Safe Play Me**, **One Week Love**, and **Dui Ni You Gan Jue**, check here: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yyjiu2/love_catcher_in_bali_e01_221118/iwvbxrm/\n\n---\n\nBut ya, start with **Terrace House** (/r/terracehouse) and its Chinese version, **Shanghai Sharelife** (/r/Shanghaisharelife).\n\nBtw, somebody from the terracehouse subreddit said (https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/z2ohtr/any_chance_the_show_will_be_back/izh9z6g/) there's a new Japanese dating show called **Ai no Sato** that may be coming in 2023 on Netflix. I think ya earlier this year I read that some production companies are making new Japanese dating shows that are more in line with Terrace House's slice of life and so on content.\n\nOtherwise there's **Ainori Love Wagon** (Asian Journey and African Journey are available on international Netflix, it has way older seasons (from the 2000s) that have no English subs and are only available in Japanese Netflix/sites).\n\nOh and **REA(L)OVE** is like the predecessor to Pink Lie and Secret Man and Woman. Long story short, REA(L)OVE can get dark and real offensive due to the hosts/panelists but they're clearly trolling, so just watch until the end if you want to see the secret shame and so on concept at its current peak (with the secret/shame/etc. concept, nothing has really topped REA(L)OVE since its Netflix release in 2018).\n\nAnyway, don't forget the **Chinese version of Heart Signal (search up: \u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7), there's like 5 seasons** of that now, meanwhile Season 4 of the original Korean version is still missing, probably will air this 2023 as they said they're like filming or something right now this winter or so of 2022.\n\nThere's also the **Chinese version of Love Catcher, it's called The Secret X (\u673a\u667a\u7684\u604b\u7231)**, Episode 1 from iQIYI Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTj-dJkp8o\n\nThe Future Diary (this is more like a scripted romance/dating show, original version is Japanese) actually has a Chinese version now (just released like a month ago), but it has like no English subs at the moment, hopefully somebody will pick it up. It's called **Am I In Your Future (\u6211\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u672a\u6765\u5417)**, by MangoTV. This is Episode 1 Part 1 on the \u8292\u679cTV\u70ed\u64ad\u7efc\u827a MangoTV Super Variety channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEtJHPhpptc\n\n---\n\n**Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81)** is kinda like Ainori Love Wagon but in China. Basically they're university students that are having a field trip, lol. So they get missions/dates/etc. They got them islands.\n\nTwinkle Love has a lot of friendships formed in the show. Like it's one of the best shows for that, you can see them shipping each other and so on, lmao.\n\nTwinkle Love is available on YOUKU or the YOUKU channel(s) on Youtube. This is particularly good if you want to go back/forward to that freshness of young adult life ([btw, flamingos and parrots are geese] (https://www.reddit.com/r/heartsignal/comments/ns11y8/friends_share_life_terrace_house_twinkle_love/)).\n\nFor Twinkle Love, at the end of each day they have to record a message for the person they liked/spent time the most. And listen to their own message (through earbuds) IN FRONT OF EVERYONE, so it's kinda dramatic af, lol.\n\nTwinkle Love or \u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81 Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxP-Ye9kr24\n\nTwinkle Love Season 2 Episode 1 Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78vUkTAhuG8\n\n---\n\n**Relationship S3/Let's Fall In Love Season 3 (\u6211\u4eec\u604b\u7231\u5427 \u7b2c\u4e09\u5b63)**, Episode 1 from YOUKU Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JprQ5Fd4Qo.\n\nRelationship S3/Let's Fall In Love Season 3 has that chillax vibe to it. This was unexpectedly so good for me due to the cast/location/etc.\n\nLet's Fall In Love Season 3 is a more mature or really laidback version of these dating shows though as they're in a somewhat rural/etc. area (city of Dali by Erhai Lake in Yunnan, southwest China) and so there's less of that hustle feeling. Some shots of this show really gives you that slice of life bliss.",

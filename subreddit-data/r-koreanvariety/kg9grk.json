Of course I understand him winning the Daesang--he has been on SBS for many years and signed onto several more SBS shows this year to secure the win. However, I believe the vast majority of people understand that KJK got the award due to loyalty and long service (like Kim Jongmin at KBS) rather than exceptional performance or video views.\n\nBesides, if we go by views, Jeon Somin and Yang Sechan would have won the Daesang too or Lee Kwangsoo and Yoo Jaesuk would win too. Their compilation videos get millions of views and are often trending.",

If you look at the situation, BJW refused the award, the other nominees are panelists, LSG and YJS won recently, and YSH was more of a filler. There were no other options possible so KJK winning isn't a point of contention.\n\nI'm referring specifically to the clips that the fan listed. For anyone who has watched them, it's true that the majority of those scenes are entertaining thanks to his friends, like Yang Sechan or HaHa, while his role is more passive or merely reactive. I've watched them too. In regards to workout scenes, of course he deserves credit for those, but that's not exactly a deep entertainment portfolio and it also often involved his friends creating funny content by participating in his extreme training.\n\nI saw the rant by the perpetually temperamental fan. What's interesting is that if you see KJK's interview in the days leading up to the award show, he emphasized that he should win the award because he has been on SBS for many years and specifically signed several SBS shows this year. Essentially, KJK himself said that he deserves the award due to loyalty. Knetz also commented that if he were to win the award, the reason would be similar to Kim Jongmin's Daesang award. The fact that he received the award for loyalty and longtime service rather than exceptional performance this year is not a radical or unpopular opinion. My response to that person above was simply that YouTube views aren't the reason he won and they aren't a strong or reliable indicator of anything, which is what was being suggested.",

Someone who was a massive part of the worldwide expansion of Korean media. Someone who laid the foundation, (together with his colleagues), for musicians and personalities who came after him. \n\nShow some fucking respect!\n\nYou might not like him, you might not find him entertaining, you may find other people more entertaining, all that's perfectly fine and perfectly normal too, different strokes for different folks and all that, but to start spouting off bullshit which detracts from all that he's done...\n\nGive yourselves a fucking slap!\n\nDown vote me all you want, someone needed to say what I've said.",

When LKS and Somin won the couple awards, it was obvious.

Outdoor variety shows are more difficult than studio/indoor shows.

One of the things I enjoy most about KJK\u2019s sequences is that they\u2019re rarely actually about him alone, they\u2019re often about other people in his circle. Hong Jin-young\u2019s earliest appearances were tied to the whole couple line with KJK before she was popular enough to be a regular member on her own. As much as I enjoy the appearances by all the RM cast members, the only reason Ha Ha, Se Chan, etc. ever appear on My Ugly Duckling is because of their association with KJK. Also I love the moments with his family, the trip to Vancouver with his Dad, the New Year\u2019s vacation to his grandmother\u2019s restaurant to meet his aunts and uncles, etc. (not sure which of these count as this year or last year), his attempts to communicate more openly with these reserved family members about his childhood are heartwarming. Even though he often plays the straight-faced guy who gets dragged into ridiculous situations by others, I would argue that actually his popularity exerts a lot of influence on who else appears on the show (including Jessi) and how successful the bits are.",

You could actually tell from the past daesang winners that they all have been starred/participated in more than 1 SBS show in their career (exception with the moms from My Ugly Duckling of course), which LKS still hasn't done yet.",

I just started watching this year and some episodes are really funny like those times when all of the sons gather and just bicker with one another. ~~When Heechul said Tak Jae Hoon is the mascot of MUD, he really is.~~",

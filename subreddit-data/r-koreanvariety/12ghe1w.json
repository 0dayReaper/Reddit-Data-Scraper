The main game consists of listening to a song and determining the correct lyrics for a part of it while employing different hints to get closer to the solution. Every failed attempt means more food for YouTube mukbang star Small-mouthed Haetnim. During Snack Time a different game each week determines who gets to try a snack representing this week's market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Host**\n\n* Boom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Shin Dong-yeop\n* Kim Dong-hyun\n* Moon Se-yoon\n* Park Narae\n* Hanhae\n* Key\n* Nucksal\n* Taeyeon\n* Haetnim\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Guests**\n\nIVE\n\n* Gaeul\n* Yujin\n* Wonyoung\n* Liz\n* Rei\n* Leeseo\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**One Shots**\n\n|Member|2023|Overall|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Key|2|96|\n|Seyoon|3|79|\n|Hanhae|6|64|\n|P.O\\*|0|56|\n|Nucksal|3|50|\n|Hyeri\\*|0|49|\n|Narae|2|41|\n|Taeyeon|1|21|\n|Shin Dongyeob|1|16|\n|Donghyun|0|15|\n|Haetnim|0|1|\n\n\\*\\*updated based on Wiki'\n\n\\*\\* will update score soon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Subtitles**\n\n|**Stream**|Link|\n|:-|:-|\n|Streaming site|[Viu](https://www.viu.com/ott/ph/en/vod/2119380/Amazing-Saturday-2023)|\n\n**Source**\n\n\\*Viu\n\n^(\\*you can still support @/dareumi from all the subtitle works they had done for the community by donating through -)  [^(ko-fi.com/dareumi)](https://ko-fi.com/dareumi) \\+",

            "comment": "That was a really fun episode. I'm bummed it couldn't be a PO and Hyeri reunion 5th anniversary special but IVE were fantastic. \n\nYujin was already an S-tier variety member but this just added to the proof as to why. She is fantastic. Like a Key and Mijoo she will absolutely have a LEGIT career as an entertainer in variety content once her career in IVE slows down and she can do solo work. \n\nWhat I didn't expect was for Liz to be soooo freaking funny and wacky. I knew she was funny but this was the best I've seen her. Speaking of improvement, whoa Leeseo. I was NOT expecting that. Back earlier on in IVE's content Leeseo was such a young maknae and seemed intimidated and pressured by variety content but in this, maybe because of maturity and experience, she shined. She was really funny and had the confidence and wits to play up that \"Dads friend\" bit. Her knowing to play that bit when he's just about to answer the snack quiz... -applause-. IVE is turning into quite the comedic group. Those are my favorite. LSF is bonkers hilarious and so they're my fav GG along with Mamamoo and G-IDLE.",

                    "comment": "Exactly what I thought.\n\nIVE OT6 first full album promos on Nolto? Cool with that.  \nNolto 5th anniversary? Exemplary achievemtnt that should be celebrated.\n\nfor reference, here are the rest of the other anniversary episodes:\n\n2019 (1st anniversary): Block B Bastardz (lowkey album promo)  \n2020 (2nd): none because COVID strikes (iirc the anniv week had replays)  \n2021 (3rd): AKMU (no promos, just got invited)  \n2022 (4th): Haet-nim's friends (Sini &amp; Nado) on the food table, since Haet-nim participated on dictations + pair escape room + a question from Jin-gu after\n\n...then we have this episode. It feels like they invited IVE for the sake of the major celebratory feeling, since album promos coincided with the anniversary. My gripe is they don't really have a \\~connection\\~ with the Nolto lore, if that makes sense.  \nLike one of my favorite episodes is still the AKMU episode. They were invited since their songs come up a lot of the dictation questions. The Doremi members wanted to see them and make the siblings feel the same way that the members feel when their songs play as questions. The siblings had their moments on that episode and it was entertaining and worthy of being an anniversary episode.\n\nI am typing this right before I play this episode, but this gripe has been lingering on me since the announcement of them shooting for this ep. Really wished that the 5th anniversary episode =/= IVE album promo episode.\n\nAs someone who follows IVE (I keep tabs to all post-IZ\\*ONE activities) I couldn't be more gratified that their presence in the GP is reaffirmed by all these variety guestings.  \nAs a Nolto fan though, I agree that the guesting pick for this momentous day leaves much to be desired.  \nI thought that *maybe* a BTS member could've finally appeared bc they have individual promos right now. If that happened, another part of the Nolto lore would've finally fullfilled. But, oh well, this happened.",

            "comment": "Respect to the maknae team, as first pick they only get 2 instead of 3, and they went with both the weakest cast members. Donghyun first pick as well, got me excited to see Rei reprise the Free Food antics but unfortunately this wasn't really the format for it. On the other hand, both eonni team members knew the diction song and they got both Key and Seyoon. With both Narae and Seyoon on the team getting ready to eat from the beginning you also lost out a bit more of their presence in the diction round. \n\nA few highlights were Liz casually dishing out a backhanded compliment to Hanhae, Taenggu's little moment with Rei in the answering area, Leeseo's constant teasing of her friend's dad SDY and keeping him uncomfortable culminating in that perfect snack round moment, Boom/Key actually singing along to one of the snack round songs instead of doing the classic misdirection but everyone still being thrown off by it.",

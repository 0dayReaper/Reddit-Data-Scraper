I searched through Wikipedia and the episodes seemed to stop updating, but its still there as ongoing.\n\nI've also looked online and couldn't find any episodes past 193, but there also hasn't been any announcement about it shutting down. Anyone have any updates on it?",

Also seems that KBS World also no longer air the show. Because I can't find Problem Child in the House in their TV schedule. \n\nFor Wikipedia, it's just that no user is updating the episode. However, if you check the Korean Wikipedia version, it's updated till Jan 11, 2023.",

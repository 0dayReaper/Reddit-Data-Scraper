I love the other military-related competitions, too (The Soldiers, Steel Troops, and while not exactly a competition, Fake Men on YouTube).\n\nI'm wondering if there's anything else, like a survival show or even just a cooking competition. I can't seem to find anything.\n\nEditing to add that I'm not crazy about the shows where they have celebrities competing and doing silly or random things. I'd prefer to see some serious competition.\n\nEditing again to add that i prefer serious competitions. Not the kind where everyone is acting silly, jokes around, etc (for example, shows like Running Man).",

However if you want a more intense season, watch Real Men 300.\n\nThe first two seasons are pretty chill with the idol/actor guests being the focus and mostly goofing around. But the 3rd season has a more serious cast and most of the ones that can't keep up leave halfway, like the really famous idols. \n\nFor other competitions, I know there was a Master Chef Korea, but the only season that I know has full subs is the celebrity version. \n\nI would include Hit the Stage and SWF/SMF but you don't want dancing shows so \ud83d\ude05.",

Season 1 (sadly not subbed), has 40-70 year old ex-national athletes of various sports, but their ages meant that they weren't as quick to learn the new sport and their staminas weren't great, but it was still pretty entertaining to watch.",

There is also an amazing part where they invited 2 child prodigies on the show to play against and get schooled/coached by them. \n\nIts such a great show.

They gathered the top stunt men teams in Korea to compete with each other.\n\nIf you liked physical 100 there\u2019s also a military competition show called The Soldiers that was on SBS.

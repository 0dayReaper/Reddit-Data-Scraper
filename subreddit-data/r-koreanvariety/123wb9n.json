Also that man who always kind of dressed like a child. I watched it for jennie but i stayed watching it because of them.\n\nI tried to enjoy 2 days 1 night season 3 but i didnt like it (maybe i dditn give it enough time)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks in advance",

Cause the PD for that also did other shows that worth watching.\n\nHis stint on RM(Running Man) is imo the best episodes the show has ever done,especially if you value witty quick quizzes and chemistry between cast members.\n\nHis other show is Sixth Sense and it's one of the favorite show in this sub.",

The main thing that made Michuri so great was the cast, chemistry, conversations and games. Which RM does quite well. \n\nThe show is currently focused on the members themselves and their chats with each other and the digs they take at each other. \n\nAlso, since they\u2019re completely in their comfort zone a lot of hilarious moments are born. So for me, was a great show and still is.",

    "postText": "**Description**\n\n&gt;The cast and guests play games to win and enjoy different foods from a featured outdoor market in Korea. The main game consists of listening to a song and determining the correct lyrics for a part of it while employing different hints to get closer to the solution. Every failed attempt means more food for YouTube mukbang star Small-mouthed Haetnim. During Snack Time a different game each week determines who gets to try a snack representing this week's market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Host**\n\n* Boom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Shin Dong-yeop\n* Kim Dong-hyun\n* Moon Se-yoon\n* Park Narae\n* Hanhae\n* Key\n* Nucksal\n* Taeyeon\n* Haetnim\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Guests**\n\n* Kim Tae Woo\n* Tei\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**One Shots**\n\n|Member|2022|Overall|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Key|32|94|\n|Seyoon|16|76|\n|Hanhae|18|57|\n|P.O\\*|8|56|\n|Hyeri\\*|0|49|\n|Nucksal|11|45|\n|Narae|3|38|\n|Taeyeon|7|20|\n|Shin Dongyeob|2|15|\n|Donghyun|1|15|\n|Haetnim|1|1|\n\n\\*\\*updated based on Wiki'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Subtitles**\n\n|**Stream**|Link|\n|:-|:-|\n|Streaming site|[Viu](https://www.viu.com/ott/ph/en-us/vod/467981/Amazing-Saturday-2022)|\n\n**Source**\n\n\\*Viu\n\n^(\\*you can still support @/dareumi from all the subtitle works they had done for the community by donating through -)  [^(ko-fi.com/dareumi)](https://ko-fi.com/dareumi) ^(+)\n\n^(P.S.

Kim Taewoo is funny as always (his obsession to starving haetnim lol) and Tei\u2019s voice is just incredible\n\nNolto is always the most fun when a song you love appears as a quiz! I was not expecting Stray Kids to ever make an appearance, and definitely not Christmas EveL lmao it was fun to watch them struggle. Oort Cloud also sounds like an absolute banger I\u2019m adding it to my playlist rn",

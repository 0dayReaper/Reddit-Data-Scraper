IDK I feel bad for the guy, when he sees the episode.",

It was even worse when we had the opposite behavior happening at the same time: Hyun Sik (who paired with hair salons owner) going around and politely letting other women know where he stood with them and not causing any misunderstanding or awkward moments. I think that is the kind of behavior you would like to see in someone you are dating.",

I guess the WJ turning all the women off w something he said in the preview teaser was just evil editing.\n\nOmg the E women w the I men next week should be hilarious. Will we see any couples?",

    "postText": "Hi all, I'm a fan of this show and am excited for season 2. That said, I want to buy the Monsters hat and root for my new favorite korean baseball team from the US. I can't seem to find a way yet... but I thought if there was enough interest I could reach out to the director's team or JTBC somehow.\n\nIf anyone is interested in fan gear also and would like to be notified of such updates, please visit here: [https://clean-sweep-one.vercel.app/](https://clean-sweep-one.vercel.app/) \n\nThanks!",

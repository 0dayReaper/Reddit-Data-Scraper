Lee Yeon Bok, Korea's top Chinese chef, and celebrities visit schools, companies, and sports teams worldwide to serve K-meals and promote a healthy, nutrient-balanced meal in the Korean Style. \n\nit's more matching to Baek Jongwon's Backpacker Chef. they go in different places and cook food for a certain group. the difference is just that it's in UK and US (for the next half) and it is centered on Tray food style.",

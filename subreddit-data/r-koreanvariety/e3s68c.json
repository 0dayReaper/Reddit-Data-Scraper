    "postText": "\u201cRunning Man\u201d may be getting a very special guest!\n\nAccording to exclusive reporting by News1, Ryan Reynolds will be making a guest appearance in early December on \u201cRunning Man.\u201d It is being said that filming will take place while Ryan Reynolds visits Korea with M\u00e9lanie Laurent and Michael Bay on December 2 for their Netflix film \u201c6 Underground.\u201d\n\nThe reports state that Ryan Reynolds agreed to appear on \u201cRunning Man\u201d in order to greet his Korean fans in a fun way amidst his packed schedule. Though filming will take place over a short period of time, \u201cRunning Man\u201d is said to be planning a segment that highlights traditional culture in Korea.\n\nRyan Reynolds surprised everyone last year when he made a special appearance on MBC\u2019s \u201cThe King of Mask Singer,\u201d so anticipation is high to see if he will appear on \u201cRunning Man\u201d and what kind of synergy he will create with the cast. His episode is expected to air in December.\n\n\u201cRunning Man\u201d airs every Sunday at 5 p.m. KST. Catch up with the latest episode below!\n\nhttp://www.soompi.com/article/1368717wpp/ryan-ryenolds-to-reportedly-make-guest-appearance-on-running-man",

But because there were a lot of non-regular viewers, they were disappointed at the games and how under-utilized the guests were (and how overutilized the popup pirate was). A lot of negative comments, so Jung Chul Min PD stepped down as main PD (though I think he was still part of RM's staff, just not main PD). Then I guess he went away and made Michuri for a while.",

At least that's what happened when Mission Impossible cast came.\n\nI think Wassup Man pulled this concept off neatly. Maybe because it was basically an interview with Joon Park being himself.",

It works against the RM format where any meaningful contribution to an episode would require at least half a day's dedication.\n\nI'm a regular RM viewer, and I was very disappointed w the Tom Cruise &amp; co. episode because it broke the show's flow. It was more akin to an episode of The Ellen Show than RM. I mean, if you're going to break the format for some special guests, you can at least make sure that it will deliver some good entertainment (see Jack Black and Stephen Curry in Infinity Challenge) instead of some overplayed gag segments.\n\nI hope they come up w something more interesting with Ryan Reynolds &amp; co. If it was just him, I would be more optimistic. They might have to be less ambitious with Bay and Laurent in the equation.",

    "postText": "The notorious Kyu-Gyu Line doesnt have to be introduce anymore. A twin with different face and personality, one is calm and calculative while the other is fierce and exploding in power. Our problem-solver and the team ace. \n\nWith the over-used plays of Kyu-Gyu, new and fresh line or lines is needed. This is when the new members coming through. Kim Yong Sik, a precious target striker that has been trained by Lee Dong Gook. He scored two goals in his debut match.  Supposedly, a striker that knows where and when to be to score a goal. Except, his basic skills kinda wack, which is understandable since he just joined the team (and almost all of the players have the same problem anyways). Jang Jeong Min, a player with horse speed that can make the opponent nervous. Same problem with Yong Sik. (Istg I know AJH told them to practice basic skills individually but something wrong somewhere when even the old members have no basic skills sets down yet). \n\nSeoul Tournament is in 2 months and we are in a crisis mode. Lim Nam Kyu, Andre Jin, Lee Jun Yi are injured. This is a sensitive time for the whole team. Anything can happen in 2 months. I hope players can take care of their body more. We all want to see them on Seoul Tournament. They need to overcome these obstacles and stay together until the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(P.S. I kinda depressed since our captain got injured. I hope its nothing serious. Please God dont let anything happen to him. Anyways, our captain is getting married! The wedding will be on Sunday, 18 June 2023. Yall better shower him with lots of congratulations. I'm watching. Hehehehehehehe).",

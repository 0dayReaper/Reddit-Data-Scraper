The way he selected the members for penalty, it was craziest moment of the episode IMO. \n\nIn first episode, YSC tricked him by making him believe that the camera moves as per the sensors, and the D.O. believed that. In this episode, D.O. tricked YSC in rock-scissor-paper game and YSC believed him that the D.O. will play scissor. So, it came in whole circle. His laugh after winning rock-scissor-paper game was ultimate moment for me. I am glad I got to see this side of D.O. through this show.",

Them joking around in the bus and entertaining themselves on the ride was so fun to watch. With every episode I am dreading the end because this is an excellent combination of people and I hate to see them part at the end of the trip. And Kyungsoo was an absolute legend and showing his true nature.",

With the cast and BoPil PD, I think I expected something that involves more games and penalties, but there's way too much eating and transit scenes. I hate watching bus rides for 30 minutes of the cast trying to entertain themselves for 4 hours, and it's been happening every episode. I could understand including it in the first 2 episodes due to arriving at the airport and getting to their beds but I didn't even appreciate Runningman's 20 minute bus chemistry and this cast doesn't even match up to that.",

So it would not make sense to compare RM with this show, anyway.\n\nEdit: So, far this show is very much living up to it's title, it involves trip, travelling by bus, visiting different places, interactions with each other, laugh, games, penalty, some soulful time with each other, showing other side of self, etc.",

And i didn't even expect more games and pretty content with the show being a more healing/travel show.\n\nThe show just felt very disjointed to me. Bopil wanted the show to be a school trip like,but they cast people who have weak chemistry together. They don't know each other and you can probably remove some of them and have the same effect,because they have the same role. But hey this is their first time together so maybe they needed time to get comfortable with each other. But i feel like the idea of the show itself is just a group of friends hanging out together,so that creates mismatch between idea and execution.\n\nMy main issue with the show though,under the somewhat weak chemistry and lack of games,is that the episodes are quite boring. I don't understand why they have to do the onsen/feels scenes so early when they barely know each other.And the food/drinking scenes are way too long. There were just SO many fillers in an episode imo.\n\nHopefully the pace will get better in the later episode,cause i have high hope for Bopil and the cast.",

            "comment": "I wish Park Jimin could\u2019ve stayed on longer. She did a lot to help the hidden player team. It would\u2019ve been awesome if she got lisa out. \n\nIt was hilarious to watch how Jinho didn\u2019t think Yunb\u2019s tactic was a good one, yet it helped them so much. Poor Knucks haha but it was awesome to see how the losing team said they needed Knucks for the next team mission. Chulgu was also a vital member by telling his team to get Yunb/identifying the pyramids as the items they need to crack (and I was surprised Dex had noticed where one was when he first looked around the house)\n\nI like how Dex and HSJ got over the situation quickly and you could tell they were more worried about Pi, as she was shocked from everything that had happened. I know it was serious when it was being filmed, but the fact that Knucks was the one who whistled, which set HSJ off, was funny to see (especially that it only came to light now) because Knucks was saying it was my fault for being swayed by Yunb and then Yunb also felt bad that he had kinda caused this all to happen. Dex even said that it\u2019s nice for viewers to be engrossed in the show, but that doesn\u2019t mean actively hating on players",

Since he wouldn't fall for YunB's tactics, he thinks nobody will. Well (.^.). It's like ep 1 of The Genius haven't taught him anything about overestimating his opponents lmao.\n\nThough I also didn't think it would work hahaha. YunB and Knucks dudes alliance were offputting before, like a classic chauvinist bros. But after the downfall to their alliance they just became funny hahahha.",

Not to mention actually seeing him smile rather than usual scowling on episode clip.\n\nOff all the extra info knowing that xitsuh actually have back disk kinda ads to the fact it's must be hard for all the jungle team especially once with medical condition\n\nOmg seeing reaction of disdain on knucks face during that fated reunion of his n YunB\ud83e\udd23. Knucks must be really sure of doubting yurisa during episode 3 that it's really clouded his judgement. N yeah when yurisa caught him snooping around those basement, n just casually talked to him, it's must be really weird for him.\n\nThe whitebeard n conquerer haki reference \ud83e\udd23 idk Dex n YunB are One piece fan. Mofoing PD didn't show both of them apologizing n settled the mood kinda sly ngl. Just manipulate viewers reaction.\n\nIt's kinda nice to have this kind of review session n fast explanation from the cast because we remembered in genius series n many more variety show the cast getting hate, cancelled n destroy their careers because of 1 decision in the show example that girl in S2 genius n etc",

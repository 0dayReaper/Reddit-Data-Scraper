I think the charm that this kind of show has is mainly for fans, that's why some non-fans find it hard to join the fun since there will be lots of inside jokes. But even if there is one show, what will you think it is?",

You can check out their Explorers of the human body, weekly idol/knowing bros episodes, SJ returns etc. Other grps that are great to me include 2pm, shinhwa broadcast and bts.\n\nYou can also check out shows by na pd, starting from new journey to the west, followed by those on channel full moon (things that make me groove, mapo hipsters). There's also showterview, jeongwaja (changsub) etc on youtube.\n\nHaha realised i recommended way too many, but its difficult to pinpoint one show from the past decade of being thoroughly entertained.",

            "comment": "Do yourself a favor and watch these: \n\n1. Dreamcatcher Mind \n\nDreamcatcher is not exactly a Kpop group as their main genre is Rock and they are not from a big company. However, they are the most fruity and genuinely fun idols I've ever known. Even if you're not a fan, I will promise you will laugh watching their variety show. Start with this episode: https://youtu.be/ewDCW4hVOo0 where they play a real-life version of AmongUs. Even not knowing the girls' characters you'll have a great time with this. The good thing about DC is that they're on the \"older side\" (the two oldest are almost 29, the rest were born mid to late 90s). They're from a small company so they don't have to worry about certain things like maintaining a fake image. They have tattoos and openly talk about them and show them off, they've talked about past boyfriends (on the variety show) and the last episode of their variety show is a drinking episode. They do games and mix up drinks as punishment for the loser. They are chaotic and messy and raw and embarassing and have been accused of queer baiting (\ud83d\ude02 I think that is a compliment btw, because the fruit salad that is Dreamcatcher is delicious) and they are wonderful. Also, they spent half of an episode of this variety show talking about whether they would sht on the streets for money or not \ud83d\ude02. \n\n2. Blackpink 24/365 \n\nhttps://youtu.be/Is0iob8lz4w\n\nYou might not be a fan of their music or act, but these girls are also pretty hilarious. This episode of their variety show is my favorite ever. Jisoo doesn't talk much, but her comments had me dying. Rose is just utterly shameless and gives up halfway through. Jennie has terrible luck and is horrible at lying, Lisa us clumsy and cute. They are very limited in what they can do and say and show, but even with all of that this was super fun. \n\nBut I'd still rank the Dreamcatcher one higher. If you don't want to jump into a variety show not knowing the girls, This is a good introduction to their mess (Sua cussing so casually is my favorite thing ever. Girl didn't even realize until Jiu wheezing next to her): https://youtu.be/L1YtM4oar70 or these two idiots (Yoohyeon and Handong) doing a vlive and someone asked them to sing Wendy's song, titled \"like water\" but they phrased it as \"can you please sing like water?\" ... So these two proceeded to literally sing like water. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 best option would be to watch \"This is...\" Series from here introducing each member in 7 minutes long videos: https://youtu.be/6xeoZK3MaXw",

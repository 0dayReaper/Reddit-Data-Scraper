    "postText": "If you are interested about the running man ending part only then you can just go to the third part you will find it there. There are a lot of spaces between each part so you can find it easily\n\ntalk about his current programs + IC + Come Back Home is in second part\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(FIRST PART) (interview by JTBC)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\"Yoo Jae-suk surpassed Yoo Jae-suk.\"**\n\nThis is a review from the Baeksang Arts Awards, giving Yoo Jae-suk (49) the 'Grand Prize'. At the 57th Baeksang Arts Awards, Yoo Jae-suk won the Grand Prize in the TV category. He overcame crises and limitations through bone-shearing changes and became a facilitator who can proceed flexibly regardless of age, gender, or field.   Yoo Jae-suk  was given a trophy at the Baeksang Arts Awards with his name engraved on it. This is Yoo Jae Suk's first interview with the media in 8 years.\n\nIn fact, it is not easy to meet Yoo Jae-suk as a guest on an interview or program. As an interviewer and listener, he always draws out and empathizes with other people's stories, so there are not many opportunities to hear his deepest stories. This is the reason why this interview is even more special.\n\nThe interview went differently than expected from the start. In many cases, management team will always present at interviews with celebrities to filter out potentially sensitive comments. But for YJS he politely asked his team \"I'll take care of everything, so take a break outside\". We thought he would avoid some questions but he was more honest than anyone else. He talked a lot about winning the grand prize, his 30th anniversary of his debut, and big and small changes in the programs he participated in. The scheduled interview time was one hour, but he ended the interview after talking for another 30 minutes.\n\nWhen asked why he usually doesn't do interviews, he said \"If I'm going to do it, I'll have to meet all the media. I can't do this as a monthly event so what should I do?\" he laughed. In just 90 minutes of interview, we understand why he is called \"God Yoo\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**- It's been a month, but once again, congratulations on winning.** **I guess you didn't expect the award at all.**\n\n\u201cThank you. Last year, I won the (TV category) award, so I only thought about the award this year, but I was stunned to be nominated and I never dreamed of receiving the grand prize.\u201d\n\n**-After receiving the award, you met and had a dinner with the 'Husband is a Grasshopper' team, a corner of KBS 2TV's 'Comedy in the World', which aired in 1997.**\n\n\"We always said 'Let's get together once', finally we had time, so we met. (Kim) Soo-yong hyung, (Song) Eun-i, and (Kim) Sook. We met at a restaurant and ate meat and chatted. I always said I was going to buy them food, but eventually we met this time \"\n\n**-You emphasized that you are a 'comedian' in your impressions.**\n\n\"I didn't think about it on purpose, but while I was talking , it suddenly occurred to me. I often think that the profession of a comedian itself is slowly disappearing. It is one of many professions in the entertainment industry, and I was afraid of it disappearing, sotahts why I said it\"\n\n**-The real 'comedian' is disappearing.**\n\n\"I was not the cast, but when the 'Gag Concert' that everyone worked hard for came to an end, the only comedy program left now is 'Comedy Big League'. Broadcasters have changed and platforms have diversified. Its very saddening.\"\n\n**-Why don't you put up your own name and do a content that selects juniors?**\n\n\"Even if I do, the question always arises as to whether it will be possible to create content that many people can relate to and have a competitive edge in. I dont know if there is an obvious number of invisible laughter and that level of content. If not, would it have any meaning then.\"\n\n**-These days, juniors have found a new way through YouTube.**\n\n\"The broadcasting station does not select comedians, but the juniors take care of them and try various things on new platforms. There is nothing to help, but I feel proud and great when I see them. As the market grows bigger than now, it would be nice for people in this profession, including me, to add power\"\n\n**- Do you often watch YouTube?**\n\n\"At least, the thing that stands out the most these days is Kim Hae-jun. That's why I invited him to tvN's 'You Quiz on the Block' earlier this year.\"\n\n**- Do you have any plans to do YouTube yourself?**\n\n\" \"Like a TV program, you have to create the content and keep doing it. I dont have the courage to do it consistenly. Also there are already many fun people on Youtube.\"\n\n**-I think the public will also like the content of the ordinary Yoo Jae-suk's daily life.**\n\n\"It may not be difficult, but viewers will have something to look forward to, and to do that, you have to spend time and effort, and you have to consistently upload at the promised time, but I'm not sure if I will be able to keep it.\n\n**- You've been keeping your promises with the public for 30 years without fail.**\n\n\"It's a promise, so it's natural to keep it. I dont have much free time yet. I've been doing four programs a week and I still feel packed. It's not easy to add one more here.\"\n\n**-Is there any driving force that has been able to maintain self-management for 30 years?**\n\n\"Im not the planning type,Im a type to do something if its necessary. I quit smoking at the same time as I got married and started exercising to increase my stamina. If there are things I have to give up in order to take responsibility for the things I choose, I boldly put them down.\n\n**- It's very difficult to keep that promise.** **Don't you dream of escaping?**\n\n\u201cPeople have been curious about it a lot. But so far, things have not been hard enough to die. So I don\u2019t even think about escaping. Im not the type to stick to one thing.\"\n\n**-So, because you chose the next best solution, the results were perfect.**\n\n\"You can feel that way because you see it on TV. I hate the homework given to me, so I avoid it, but I have to do it well. I gained more responsibility like that while doing 'Infinite Challenge'.\"\n\n**- The sense of responsibility is strong enough to overcome fear.**\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s often said, but there were 9 years of hard times (in the beginning of my debut). At that time, I prayed a lot. I said that if I am given one chance, I will never complain. I also said that I would accept any punishment if I am being lazy in any task. I don't know if it was because of this prayer, but that thought became stronger. It is a promise to the viewers every week, and I thought that if I became a member of the broadcast, I should do my best.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(SECOND PART)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-MBC's 'Infinite Challenge' is still popular. What did 'Infinite Challenge' mean?\u201cEven when I was doing the show, I thought, \u2018Would I ever meet a show like this in my life again?\u2019, and when it ended, I thought, \u2018Could I even do another variety show after this?\u2019 It\u2019s been three years since it ended, but it\u2019s an important program that I could never take out of my life. When we started, a higher-up at the broadcasting station said, \u2018Let\u2019s go for 10 years.\u2019 At the time, I was like, \u2018What?\u2019, but we received so much love.\u201d\n\n**- You grew up together with MBC PD Kim Tae-ho.**\n\n\"He's one of the producers who gave me a lot of fresh stimulation. Of the many episodes of 'Infinite Challenge', 'Run with a bag of money' was really fresh. As soon as it started, I was like, 'What is this really?' It felt like I was the main character in a movie. The immersion was no joke. I wanted something like this even after it was over.\u201d\n\n**-In the early days of 'Infinite Challenge', you were a weak character, but these days you have turned into a character who is annoyed and angry.**\n\n\"When I was playing 'Infinite Challenge', it would be a mess if I didn't do it as I needed someone to control the situation, so thats why I did that. Just because a professional baseball team has only a home run hitter doesn't mean they win. In the end, the team must match organically. I don't say I'm going to be on charge of something, but if there's a role I have to take on the team, I think I should do it. I just adapt it to the situation, not on purpose. Even if it's not the best combination. I think it's important to make it together.\"\n\n**-The recent attempt to expand the worldview of 'Infinite Trading' was really good.** **Are other items open for expansion?**\n\n\"We're talking about infinite expandability. We're dreaming of a free program that the cast can carry organically. In 'Infinite Challenge', only the format was free, but the cast wasnt. Of course, there may be trial and error at first. In that direction, I hope this program can go on without me.\u201d\n\n**-It was very nice to see you and Shin Ha-kyun reunited on 'You Quiz' recently.**\n\n\"Ha Kyun was a junior in college. When I first saw Ha Kyun in the movie 'Joint Security Area JSA', I said, 'Ha Kyun is making a movie.' But it was so nice to meet you at Baeksang this time, so we exchanged greetings. When I told the crew of 'You Quiz' about that, they said that they would try to cast Ha Gyun. He was a quiet friend. He was a friend who worked hard in club activities.\"\n\n**-Aren't you giving your opinion when recruiting for 'You Quiz'?**\n\n\"Of course, I and (Jo) Seho have said in a tone of 'how would it feel if I cast this person'. But my thoughts are not conveyed to the production team by saying, 'Do this', so the final decision on the agreed conclusion is made by the production team. When we have a problem, we think about it together, and we talk about how to overcome this situation. I think we know the best about the work we have to do in each position.\n\n**- Is there a program that you have been through so far that you would like to try again?**\n\n\u201cThere is nothing like that, but I want to do a program where we make something together. Doing alone has become the identity or concept of \u2018what do you do when you play?\u2019 In fact, it is impossible to continue the program alone.\n\n**-I heard that you broke the mold once again with 'What do you do when you play?**\n\n**'**\"It's all I've done in front of me. At first, after 'Infinite Challenge' it may feel like a crisis unitl a 'What do you do when you play?' finds it a stable spot, but I tried to do something fun every day. I get strength when I hear good stories. \"\n\n**-MSG Wannabe all-killed the charts this time too.** **However, there are some who view this as a bad thing.**\n\n\u201cFrom the perspective of someone who likes music and listens to it often, there is a lot of cool and sophisticated music out there, but there are times when you think, \u2018I want to listen to this kind of music.\u2019 That\u2019s what \u2018How Do You Play?\u2019 is trying to do. I\u2019m very grateful for the success, but imagine the emptiness we\u2019d feel if we had invested all that money and put out new music and it disappeared without much public interest. That\u2019s why the production staff and I had to think hard about doing something like that.\u201d\n\n**-KBS 2TV's 'Comeback Home' ended with poor results.**\n\n\"I believed in the production team, and that belief has not changed. It didn't get a lot of response from the viewers, but personally, I learned something again.\"\n\n**-tvN 'The Sixth Sense 2' was the first broadcast.**\n\n\" it's fun because you cant see my characters on other programs. it's a different experience.\"\n\n**-Lee Kwang-soo got off from SBS 'Running Man'.**\n\n\"I think the viewers will feel a lot of emptiness. We keep talking about Kwang-soo while recording. We can't fill in the blanks at once. We don't know when it will happen, but we're doing our best and keep our spirit up .\"\n\n**- There was once a 'Yoo Jae-suk crisis theory'.**\n\n\"It's true that it's a job where the ratings are important, but I don't think it's good if you don't know the current trend or get too swept away. I was upset because I was a human (hearing that), but it didn't shake me much. That doesn't necessarily mean leading a trend, but I don't think it's necessary because everyone else has done it. Compromising with the trend is stable and efficient, but I think it ends there. You have to throw the odds for success\"\n\n**- Aren't you afraid of failure?**\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a personal fear of failure. I\u2019m not afraid to fail. But\u00a0the difficult part of failure is that if I fail, there are lots of other people who will struggle as well. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t feel fear of failure at first, but as I kept working, it disappeared little by little. I think that going with the flow is the right course of action.\u201d\n\n**- Did Yoo Jae-suk predict this 30 years ago?**\n\n\"Not at all. At the beginning, I was so frustrated that I just wanted to go to school. I didn't go to the broadcasting station. At that time, (Park) Suhong hyung and (Kim) Yong Man hyung came to me and said, 'You have talent, so let's do it together.\"\n\n**- If we were to predict 30 years from now.**\n\n\"Im not the type to plan something... Will it be broadcast until then? It's not realistically difficult. I talk about it with my colleagues. I said that we should go hang out more often when we're older.I think I will spend my time like that.\"\n\n**- Up until now, you've been acting and singing, and you've taken on a lot of different challenges.**\n\n\"I really had no desire for any new field. I have no ability and I have no interest in that. But I have to broadcast one week at a time. In a way, it can be a kind of responsibility for the program. Of course, it wasn't just responsibility, but without the responsibility, I don't think I could have come this far.\"\n\n**-Is there any field where you found unexpected talent?**\n\n\u201cWhile doing something, there was no such thing as \u2018this fits really well\u2019. It\u2019s just for a week\u2019s broadcast. I\u2019ve been to New Zealand for filming KBS 2TV\u2019s \u2018Departure Dream Team\u2019 before. I had to bungee jump from a height of 125m. It's too scary to think about now. I have a phobia of heights, so I can't approach the difficulties of apartments well, but if I don't play this, there's nothing to go on the air. So I was very scared, but I ran. I've never jumped with a thought of \"this is play\" . I can still hear the wind in my ears. It's even winter.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(THIRD PART)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYoo Jaesuk also talked about his kids and personal life.\"Naeun likes me a lot. Na Kyungeun also said, 'I don't know why she likes you so much. It's unexpected\u2019. I don't know either, but Naeun especially likes me and look for me often.\"\n\n**- Looking back on 30 years of debut, a lot has happened.**\n\n\"For example, when I first moved to a broadcasting station and hosted a program called 'Star Survival Living Together,' MBC, when I went to meet citizens while doing a program called 'Exclamation Point', 'Infinite Challenge', 'X-Men', 'Kung-Kung-Ta of Horror' ', etc, I remember a lot of things. In the case of 'Kung Kung-ta of Horror', when it was on the verge of being cancelled, PD Kim Seok-yoon told me to try the word relay game, and it worked out well. When it was said that 'Infinite Challenge' would be finished after 6 months, we went to New Zealand, and that was the turning point. None of my shows hit the ground running. Each and every one of my shows went through difficulties\u201d\n\n**- Didnt 'Running Man' turn out well easily?**\"\n\n\u201cAt first, the reaction was, \u2018What even is that?\u2019 There\u00a0was a turning point when there was talk about shutting the show down.\u00a0At that time, the producing director received a sponsorship offer and we went to Thailand. If the Thailand shoot didn\u2019t result in a turning point for us, the show could have ended there. We decided to give it our best shot, but we were shocked at the airport. There were so many fans at the airport that we couldn\u2019t pass it off as a prank. I even asked Ji Suk Jin, \u2018Is there a Hallyu star at the airport with us today?\u2019 We couldn\u2019t imagine that all those people had come to see us. There were a lot of articles about that. We were shocked, the Korean viewers were shocked, and the production staff were shocked as well. We really had no idea that we were that popular.\u201d\n\n**- You're a Hallyu star right?**\"\n\n\"Me? (Laughs) I can't do it right now because of Corona 19, but I said that it was very grateful to go to a performance together with 'Running Man'. When we just started our tour, Ji suk jin went to an overseas concert and received cheers from many fans but when he arrived at Incheon airport, he said that it was like having a splendid dream and returning to reality when they arrived. (Laughs) It was such an amazing experience.\u201d\n\n**-You said you don't follow the trends, but you're up-to-date with the latest songs and news.**\n\n\"It's not on purpose, but I've always liked reading newspapers. If I'm too busy to read, I leave it and read it later. I listen to music while exercising. I'm not intentionally studying or trying to keep up with trends, but it's something I learn naturally in everyday life. Like the younger generation. I can't know all the details, but I want to know a certain amount of flow to be able to tell the story and deliver it to the viewers. I mainly read newspapers because it's easier to read newspapers than online news since it feels good to read and fold it like you do with a book.\"\n\n**-Aren't you struggling to keep up with outdoor entertainment?**\n\n\"The system is different, so I don't rush to shoot everything at once. Especially since the viewers are immersed in the cast, they dont want to see us having a hard time. It's not as hard as I thought.\"\n\n**- I'm not good at interviews.**\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t do it, but because there are so many media outlets, I always have to do what with others too if I start doing it, so that\u2019s always a concern. I can\u2019t hold an interview like a monthly event.\n\n**- You don't even make guest appearances.**\n\n\"It's because I can't only go on a specific program. Actually, everything is driven by relationships, but I feel bad for others if I only go to a specific program because of a relationship with someone.\"\n\n**-How do you spend most of your time at home?**\n\n\"If Im done with chores , I go to my room, read a book, and watch TV. If Im being called outside, I can help with childcare and cooking. I'm not good at cooking, but I cook ramen well, so I make and eat ramen by myself.\"\n\n**-Are you a father who plays well with children?**\n\n\"I don't think I can say that I play well, but I tend to try to spend time with my children\n\n\\-Do the **children look for their father ?**\n\n\"My daughter Naeun likes me a lot. Na Kyungeun also says, 'I don't know why she likes you so much. It's a bit surprising'. I don't know either, but Naeun especially likes me and looks for me often. I always smile when I look at Naeun. (Laughs)\"\n\n**-Does your son Ji-ho know what his father does and what a great person he is.**\n\n\u201cWe have similar personalities so he doesn\u2019t really talk about it, but I think that since he goes to school and has friends who talk about it, he knows pretty well. Sometimes he asks, \u2018Dad, what\u2019s that about?\u2019 but it\u2019s not really because he\u2019s curious so much as his friends ask about it and he has to answer them.\u201d\n\n**- Has he reached puberty?**\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite there yet, but I think that as a fifth-grader, he\u2019s\u00a0slowly carving out his own space. There\u2019s a lot of online schooling these days, and\u00a0I\u2019m the type\u00a0to look often into his room to see how he\u2019s doing, but he keeps closing the door.\u201d\n\n**- I don't think I've ever heard of eyewitness accounts related to everyday life.**\n\n\"Even if I go, I only go to the bakery, stationery, or mart in front of my house. Surprisingly, people don't recognize me as much as I think. It may be because I wear a mask, and I think it's because I wear a hood or a hat.\"\n\n**- You are the representative of the entertainment industry 'icon of good deeds'.** **Isn't this modifier sometimes burdensome?**\n\n\"I am able to do this job because I am loved by so many people. Fortunately, I can do it now because I have a good income, but there may come a day when I cannot do this in the future. But I think it is natural to do it until the end as long as you are alive.\"\n\n**- There is a boom in golf these days. Do you play golf?**\n\n\"I played in the past, but now I can't. I barely do any exercise. There are a lot of golfers around, so I want to play, but I don't have time to do that. My acquaintances are too old and I don't have the right clothes. A year or two ago an acquaintance asked me to go out for rounding after a long time. I had time so I asked to go but then I thought my golf clothes were not appropriate as they were bought during the Tiger Woods heyday in the late 1990s. So I asked to go next time and canceled the excursion.\"\n\n\\- **Do you have any other hobbies?**\n\n\"I don't have a lot of things I want to do or have to do, so I don't have a proper hobby. I just like being at home.\"\n\n**-Your own car also became a big topic of discussion.**\n\n\"Many people say, 'Yoo Jae-suk only rides domestic cars', but honestly, I bought that car for the situation, but it just happened to be a domestic car. Its surprising that people kept talking about it like its a great thing. Its the same like now. I just bought the Porsche because I think its okay. Contrary to my expectations, people kept making things up. I think there is a saying, \u2018Yoo Jae Suk is like that.\u2019 So, when I tell the production crews around me , I always say, \u2018That\u2019s what people think of me. I'm not saying I want to do it. You guys decide.' I'm not a person who lives in a box.\"\n\n**- It's out of the blue, but you have a lot of black hair.**\n\n\"I have a lot of gray hair. (Laughs) I have gray hair since I was in my 20s, and since then I have been dyeing my hair frequently.\n\n**- Everyone is going through a difficult time.** **Lastly, if you could send a message of support to the people.**\n\n\"There are a lot of entertainment content, but I want to make a lot of entertainment that focuses more on laughter with my colleagues. I want many people to relax and find comfort in their hearts through entertainment. Of course, it is very difficult for broadcasters these days, but it is difficult to produce good results without any drastic changes or challenges.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsource- [https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/article/437/0000270079](https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/article/437/0000270079) , [https://twitter.com/godjaesuk](https://twitter.com/godjaesuk), [https://www.instagram.com/p/CQx502QtuOp/?utm\\_medium=copy\\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQx502QtuOp/?utm_medium=copy_link) , -[https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/article/437/0000270080](https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/article/437/0000270080) , [https://twitter.com/godjaesuk](https://twitter.com/godjaesuk), [https://www.instagram.com/p/CQyDEWTt6my/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQyDEWTt6my/),[https://www.soompi.com/article/1477545wpp/yoo-jae-suk-talks-about-his-old-and-current-tv-shows-his-30-year-career-and-wanting-to-be-a-good-father](https://www.soompi.com/article/1477545wpp/yoo-jae-suk-talks-about-his-old-and-current-tv-shows-his-30-year-career-and-wanting-to-be-a-good-father) , [https://news.jtbc.joins.com/article/article.aspx?news\\_id=NB12014573](https://news.jtbc.joins.com/article/article.aspx?news_id=NB12014573) , [https://twitter.com/godjaesuk](https://twitter.com/godjaesuk), [https://www.instagram.com/p/CQyOVioNkIl/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQyOVioNkIl/),",

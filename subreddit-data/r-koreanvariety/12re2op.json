Penalties is a similar thing in that my heart wants to believe in the power of Gavengers superior kickers, but my brain says that WorldClass having the more experienced GK will be what matters in the end.\n\nHowever, I think Gavengers have a better chance of winning penalties than NatFam do of winning their game, unfortunately. But we'll see!\n\nEdit with result spoilers: &gt;!It's a win for my heart today, lads! GAV won penalties 3-2 and NatFam won their game 2-1!!&lt;",

I'm predicting a hard-fought 1-2 loss for them due to beginner errors which NatFam will prey upon. I'm rooting heavily for SF though since I watched Phys100 and recently followed EudDeum's YT channel. She's more playfull/hilarious than you would expect and personality/vibes wise a closer match to Dieter than Army Girl and Eesunal.",

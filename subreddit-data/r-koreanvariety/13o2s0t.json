They'd have to pay for more storage and encoding on the hostings they use, and for most people 720p is enough, so they don't care if 1/10 people would prefer better quality.",

            "comment": "because the subtitlers needs space on their computer for basically 2 versions of every video they subtitle - the raw and their completed version. Eventually, it adds up and you have no space. \n\nAlso, because we have to transcode the videos to burn the subs in. This usualyl leaves video quality somewhat not as good.\n\nAlso also, there are enough people who subtitle (like me) who are old enough to remember watching shows in 240p in the old days and find 720p \"good enough\".\n\nAlso also also, 720p video files are like half the size of 1080p ones?  thats halving the time it takes to download, transcode and upload. Which also makes 720p more accesible to more people. \n\nIf the 720p bothers you that much, download a 1080p raw, the soft subtitle files and edit the subtitles to make them a good size for the 1080p. if the raw is the same version, the timings will be the same and requires no touching up.",

Actually many videos are just 480p uploaded as 720p as the quality is exactly the same as Viu 480p. lol \n\nI have done side by side comparison on some episodes of different shows and it was the exact same video as viu 480p. \n\nNot complaining tho. Just dont understand why they would pretend its 720p when everyone can see its not.",

Or it could be from the beginning, some new Chinese dating shows and a few Korean dating shows are doing that these days, like meet for a bit before they actually all get into the house together.",

Korea didn\u2019t start relaxing their restrictions until like june last year. \n\nSince they live in a house together if one person were to get covid they all would get it, and Korean netizens were especially brutal to people who didn\u2019t follow the strict covid rules. \n\nThe youtube channel KoreanEnglishmen was like the most beloved youtube channel by Korean people because they did nothing but share with other people how amazing Korea is. However during covid his girlfriend made a short video where people came to her door to wish her happy birthday when she was in quarantine and they got crucified in the media. People got the cops involved, they ended up moving back to Britain and not making content for like half a year, and then spending another half year not even talking about korea or having his girlfriend in any of their videos. It was insane. Btw his girlfriend isn\u2019t even a big focus of his youtube content. Their whole channel got boycotted basically for just being associated with her.\n\nThey were able to recover their image now that covid has been dying down, but man, companies really don\u2019t want to get involved in a scandal because korean netizens are actually stupid. They make a big deal out of the smallest things, and they want blood and punishment dished out, its not good enough for them to hurt someones reputation.",

It\u2019s basically a show that showcases the adult entertainment industry and the people who work in it in Japan. Sung Si-kyung and Shin Dong-yup are the hosts it\u2019s really funny, entertaining, and educational.\n\nIt is for mature audiences though and it\u2019s on Netflix.",

            "comment": "It was very intresting. I didn't understand why there where so many male-only floors in that building. Was for instance the bdsm area restricted to male customers? I don't understand that reason. I also didn't understand why the male only was restricted at all. What was there that could have been the reason? I didn't see anything that was \"more\" private and embarrasing than the first floor. \n\nI also found it intresting how Japan can have this culture of porn alongside a conservative uncomfortable view about sex and display of love. The AV actress who did that thing infront of her sister was to me very strange. The AV actors where as well very intresting, the first one was to cater male but the other one was for the girls and do you know... Why is that the male japan AVs have never really been competent in female orgasms and pleasure? I would have wanted more questions about sexology and if they've have gone courses? As someone said a lot remained to be unfolded. I also found it absurd that the top host looked so chabby in his glasses andh orange blond hair. And it was funny when they talked about dating culture and relationships. I really found it great when the MC said that he says I love you all the time.. It gave another perspective since it was obviously more favoured to not say it or be tsendure (which I respect but it became more balanced). I learned a lot. \n\nIt's said that a Taiwanese version would be also made. Taiwan who is famous for these entertainment clubs where men sit in a row and have sexual games. The men seem to have a brobonding experience through it and I would like to know more about that mentality and as well have a kind of huge porn industry. I hope prostution will be talked about. \n\nI really would like to have more focus on sex from the perspective of both gender instead of having old men beeing embarresed if only a woman with a sexology background could join the MCs. That would have added intresting questions.",

While I did learn lots about a culture\u2019s sex &amp; love life that I really don\u2019t know anything about I feel like the hosts only scratched the surface and didn\u2019t go into depth about very taboo topics. \n\nI enjoyed everybody featured on the show (except maybe that guy who has to test out the pleasure toys but good for him), it was honest which was a refreshing change. \n\nAs I said I feel like there\u2019s a whole side of things they didn\u2019t get into. I can definitely see this as being made for the Korean culture as I think they didn\u2019t want to make viewers uncomfortable with things they\u2019re not used to and kept saying how conservative Koreans are in comparison. Definitely not like a VICE piece or something of the likes. I would have loved to have seen them shed more light on areas that are in the dark and also the looked over and exploited areas esp in Japan but understand they were probably not fit for the role or looking to shed light on areas. But it\u2019s the reality of the sex industry. Also trialling more areas or items would have been great even if they were silly or entertaining I think for viewers to become more engaged and intrigued. Would be cool to see them go to other countries or even feature Korea next time as I feel from what I\u2019ve seen from Korean media it is becoming a more comfortable topic for the younger generations",

It seems like that might have been the case since they give away personal information. Also, idk why, but I was hoping SK + DY would try out one of the toys themselves. Not on camera of course, but I expected them to lmao. This was a really fun watch, looking forward to more seasons!",

Love JM repeatedly telling and reminding everyone, \"I'm not mad....om......\" and at the end of the ep DD and MS literally laughing so hard they are crying \ud83d\ude02.  JM is variety gold\ud83c\udfc6.  There is no 1N2D without JM.",

What a simpleton, an endearing one too.\n\nJo PD\u2019s celebratory pose was so cute, and I loved how everyone pitched in to catch the mudfish. That &gt;!mischievous whistle prank he pulled!&lt; though, sigh.\n\nCan\u2019t wait for the new maknae next week. I saw a compilation of his struggling moments and he seemed like a klutz. First impressions from the preview, he\u2019s like a KJM-NIW hybrid. Looking forward to him playing staple games, esp The Perfect Pitch.",

It's brutal, remembering my days doing set work. I couldn't enjoy the show because it hit quite close to home. They don't work every week so it's not so bad, but ugh the back pain! One time I worked close to 48 hours straight and all the muscles on my body seized up and I could barely drive home, went straight to a massage therapist and he was like, your back is like a plank. I had to get a 2 hour massage.\n\nYoon Seon Ho seems great so far. Their choice to not choose an cerebral member seems quite intentional. Great, no one needs to be an ace and shake the balance with this bunch.",

The &gt;!mudfish catching!&lt; sequence was unexpectedly wholesome to watch.\n\nFor some reason, I found the &gt;!DinDin, Se Yoon, and Jong Min reunion!&lt; SO oddly funny. They were so sleep-deprived... I felt bad for the cast members by the end of the episode, though. They really had such a long filming and a lot of traveling. &gt;!and I was very nervous for Se Yoon at the end.!&lt;\n\nLooking forward to getting to know our new maknae next week. His energy is great already. &gt;!sad that DinDin won't be there since he got sick! I hope he's doing better now.!&lt;",

They were so funny and Jongmin still being funny after all that was just hilarious. They were all so happy to see each other. Didn't care for the last ep, but this episode was hilarious. Hopefully they got all the rest they needed afterwards.",

No phone and just reject call/text from other members. LOL. \n\nAlso KJM \u201cIm not mad!\u201d\nThen continue \u201cOmmmmmmmmmmmm\u201d.\n\nJunghoon with extra mischievous pulled a cheating card over Dindin. Poor Dindin. But that was funny.

Man's probably REALLY tired.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Dindin looks pissed off !&lt;for real too :(\n* What's up with bamboozling the members again and again... I don't want to see them getting \"tortured\" to this extent like having &gt;!Jongmin!&lt; do the impossible (just like &gt;!Inwoo's Jeju !&lt;mission) of &gt;!catching 30 mudfishes !&lt;in a short time. And not forgetting tricking &gt;!Seyoon and Dindin into thinking it was a luxury tour when it was NOT luxurious at all!&lt;. Damn, the bed wasn't even big enough for &gt;!Dindin and Seyoon. Poor Dindin was awake for 24 hours at that point even and slept on the couch.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Jongmin-Dindin-Seyoon reunion!&lt; was cute haha. Such a nice surprise.\n* Didn't know Yoo Seonho was joining this soon. Such a pity that Dindin caught covid.",

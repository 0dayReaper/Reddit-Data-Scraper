I am so tired at this point. I want the coaches to start train the players and build trust and teamwork between them. At this point, they just want to change the whole team. I mean it goes around and around like a circle. You got new players and you have to teach them the basics again and build teamwork again. If they kept doing this, they gonna lose a lot of fans.\n\nLets Play Soccer should be about soccer match, training, skills and teamwork. But they focus too much on audition now. They should help players to sharpen their skills. It looks like they lost the main focus of the show. \n\nWhat do you guys think about it? Is it necessary to have an audition again? Or I'm the only one who feels this way?",

So if these new players are away to compete, then the senior members will fill for them as well. This is just a cycle to compensate the absence of others and avoid any injuries whilst playing the sport. :)\n\nEdit: saw the latest episode, I guess AJW wasn't totally satisfied with the new players performance, thus, the continuation of recruitment. :)",

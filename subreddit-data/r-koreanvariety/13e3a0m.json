The ball is on target and bounces between **(TG 99- GK)**'s legs as both **(TG 59)** and **(TG 2)** try to converge and pressure the shot only to screen the kick's contact. TG now needs to score three goals to get a two goal differential, possible but not easy!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~1' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** steals the ball from **(TG 111)** and dribbles forward and is now marked by **(TG 3)**, **(AC 8)** manages to shoot the ball but it misses the mark by a foot to the short right post side!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** takes a sideline kick-in with a long rolling cross to the opposite wing for **(AC 02)** who takes a shot on target that is aimed for the middle right short side post, **(TG 99)** blocks it and steers it out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' TG Miss: **(TG 2)** takes a sideline kick-in from her territory with a deep shot on net that bounces just in front of the goal mouth area but **(AC 250- GK)** wisely lets it bounce and go out of bounds regardless of its trajectory!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!2' TG GOAL: **(AC 250- GK)** rolls a pass to **(AC 8)** who is now being pressured by **(TG 2)** and **(TG 59)** is on full court pressure on the opposite wing, **(AC 8)** crosses the ball to **(AC 02)** on the opposite wing, still deep in AC territory, **(AC 02)** attempts to pass a cross back to **(AC 8)** but the pass lacked power and with both TG offensive players on full court pressure mode, **(TG 2)** intercepts the weak pass and gets a power shot down the middle on target for a goal, **(AC 250- GK)** really didn't have a chance!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot on net that hits the top left corner and rebounds and hits **(TG 99- GK)** on the head and goes out of bounds for a corner kick, lucky for TG that the rebound off of **(TG 99- GK)**'s head didnt' go in the net because that wouldve counted as an own goal, a bit of stoppage time taken to give **(TG 99- GK)** some recovery time as it hit her face!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' TG Sub: **(TG 59)** subs off for **(TG 21)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' TG Miss: **(TG 111)** takes a sideline kick-in with a great low shot towards the net that no one manages to touch, the ball just misses the net on the wide bottom right corner by inches, not a goal if it went in!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' TG Miss: **(TG 3)** takes a sideline corner kick with a quick speedy low pass that **(TG 2)** toe re-directs that loses a lot of its momentum, the ball is on target but no power and is easily grabbed by **(AC 250- GK)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~4' AC Foul: **(TG 21)** pressures the forward ball movement of **(AC 02)** she gets in her way and **(TG 2)** comes to play some help defense and blocks the ball and dispossesses **(AC 02)**, now the ball is loose and **(TG 21)** gets to it first and with **(AC 02)** sprinting behind to recover she bulldozes **(TG 21)** and is shown the yellow card for the hard bodycheck, **(TG 21)** goes to the ground but no injuries, a direct free-kick is awarded near the 16 yard box line skewed to the right wing side!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~4' TG Miss: **(TG 2)** takes the direct free kick with a low shot that goes through the legs of players and hits **(AC 8)**'s feet for a clearing attempt but stays in the goal mouth area, all players are frantically trying to control the ball as it still is bouncing around, but **(AC 250- GK)** calmly grabs the ball from under **(AC 02)**'s feet!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~5' TG Sub: **(TG 21)** subs off for **(TG 59)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~5' AC Sub: **(AC 11)** subs off for **(AC 1)**, debut for Park HaNa!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~5' AC Foul: **(TG 3)** pressures **(AC 02)** who sticks her leg out and fouls **(TG 3)** hard as both fall to the ground, play continues down the field but the ball is smothered by **(AC 250- GK)** and the whistle blows the play dead, replay shows that **(AC 02)**'s left knee hits **(TG 3)**'s left thigh/knee, a yellow card is issued, but it's **(AC 02)**'s second yellow of the game, which is a RED card, **(AC 02)** is escorted off the field for THREE full minutes and TG will be playing one player up 4v3 (similar to a major penalty in hockey, the full time of three minutes needs to elapse for AC to get back to 4 field players)!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' AC Miss: **(AC 250- GK)** takes a goal kick with a high lobbing ball that bounces and evades TG players, **(AC 8)** manages to get to the ball but cannot get a good shot on net with **(TG 111)** marking her tight, in the end **(TG 99- GK)** smothers the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' TG Miss: **(TG 2)** takes a sideline kick-in with a cross pass to **(TG 3)** who takes a shot on net that is aimed to the near right post that **(TG 59)** manages to re-direct but it hits the right post! and back out, a flurry of back and forth as no one can really control the ball, as the ball somewhat settles down, **(TG 3)** manages to kick an outlet pass to the right side where **(TG 59)** gets a one-time volley re-direction on target that goes through the legs of **(AC 250- GK)** but is re-directed slightly so the ball hits the right post again! and goes out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' TG Miss &amp; FOUL: **(TG 2)** takes the corner kick with a deep cross pass for the last defender **(TG 111)** who takes a power shot on target that **(AC 8)** blocks, the ball goes forward and 3 TG players are chasing after the ball, **(TG 111)** kicks the ball towards her own net and **(TG 99)** picks the ball up for a backpass foul, an indirect free kick is awarded on the 16 yard box line just off center from the penalty spot, all the coaches are on the field talking to their players, the coaches stayed on the field too long that both are shown yellow cards for delay of game!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' AC Miss &amp; FOUL: **(AC 33)** touch passes the ball and **(AC 8)** tries to power shoot the ball down the middle but the TG players were instructed to rush the ball after the first touch, **(TG 2)** blocks the power shot and the ball rebounds towards the center circle with all players now chasing, **(AC 8)** goes down her left wing and tries to kill time but **(TG 59)** is there to strip the ball away from her, both **(AC 33)** and **(AC 8)** collapse on **(TG 59)** to defend but **(TG 59)** manages to kick the ball out towards the middle of the field where **(TG 111)** is all alone, she shoots with her left foot but is blocked by **(AC 8)** who then falls on top of the ball basically sitting on it and the whistle blows, **Coach Baek JiHoon** tries to argue the foul but the indirect free kick is placed on the 16 yard box line to the left wing side!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' TG Miss: **(TG 111)** touch passes the ball and moves to the left wing side and **(TG 2)** kicks the ball back to **(TG 111)**, all this short passing is disrupted by **(AC 8)** charging and taking the ball, she chases the ball down the wing and **(TG 2)** tries to kick a cross pass but **(TG 111)** is in the ball's path and the ball goes out of bounds!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!8' TG GOAL: **(TG 99- GK)** rolls a pass to **(TG 111)** who starts her dribble down the left wing and towards AC territory, she evades **(AC 1)**'s marking and cuts towards the middle with no pressure she takes a low shot that goes through the legs of **(AC 250- GK)** and in the net!, what a great individual effort, a saveable ball but being a man down didn't help AC in this goal, **(AC 02)** is due back in the game soon!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' AC Sub: **(AC 1)** subs off for **(AC 11)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' TG Miss: **(TG 59)** intercepts a weak cross by **(AC 33)** her first touch is good, and she dribbles forward but dribbles too much before taking a good shot that she is blocked by **(AC 33)**, both players go down in the collision and **(AC 250- GK)** smothers the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' TG Miss: **(TG 111)** steals the ball from **(AC 8)** and dribbles forward, it's a two-on-one with **(TG 111)** on the dribble, **(TG 59)** cutting down the right wing and **(AC 33)** as the last defender that tries to stop the dribble, **(TG 111)** manages to get a pass to the right side but the ball is bouncing, **(TG 59)** stretches her leg out and manages to make contact but the ball misses the net, **(AC 250- GK)** was in position to block the ball, the pass from **(TG 111)** was a bit too strong and bouncy, a glorious chance missed!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' AC Sub: **(AC 02)** gets back on the field as her three minute red card time has elapsed!&lt;\n\nHALFTIME SCORE LINE: &gt;!------- TG 2 - 1 AC------------!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** steals the ball from **(TG 111)** and dribbles down the right wing, **(TG 3)** is there to help defend, **(AC 8)** takes a power shot on target that is aimed for the near side middle right post, she hits the post but **(TG 99- GK)** was in good position to block it, she blocked the deflection off the post and smothered the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' AC GOAL: **(AC 02)** is being swarmed by TG defense so back passes to **(AC 33)**, who pass to her right to **(AC 8)**, who then kicks the ball forward, where **(TG 111)** has a poor first touch and the ball goes to the right wing side where **(AC 11)** controls the ball and turns around and toe kicks the ball to **(AC 8)** who dribbles down the right side and takes a power shot on target aimed for the wide right side that goes in, **(TG 99)** just barely gets her fingertips on the ball but the shot is too fast, lots of time left for TG to score two goals but it's not an easy feat!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** steals the ball from **(TG 2)** where she kicks the ball forward, **(AC 11)** is all alone and chases the ball down and controls it with her right foot first and tries to shoot with her left but falls down and takes a terrible shot, during this time **(TG 99- GK)** comes off her goal line to cut the angles down and pressure **(AC 11)**, the ball goes out for a goal kick, a glorious chance missed!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' AC Sub: **(AC 11)** subs off for **(AC 1)**, seems **(AC 11)** is a bit gassed from all the minutes she's played!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' AC Miss: **(TG 111)** comes up big with a ball trap and control to go forward with the dribble but she makes a mistake and trips on the ball which leaves the ball in front of **(AC 8)** who in return takes the ball and dribbles into TG territory with a 3-on-1, she kicks an outlet pass to the right wing for **(AC 33)** to one-time shoot on target aimed for the bottom right corner, **(TG 99- GK)** is there to smother the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' TG Miss: **(TG 3)** back passes to **(TG 111)** who takes a deep shot on target that hits **(AC 33)** on the stomach, she crouches over in pain but the ball is still in play, **(TG 2)** gets the ball and dribbles to the right wing and takes a power shot on target that is down the middle that **(AC 250- GK)** blocks and chases down the rebound with a great smother, **(TG 59)** was there to chase the ball down!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!15' AC GOAL: **(AC 8)** takes a corner kick with a shot on target that **(TG 99- GK)** blocks, three TG players collapse on the ball but no one takes charge, they kick the ball forward where **(AC 02)** is stationed, who takes a long shot that is a high lobbing ball that hits the middle of the crossbar and deflects into the net, **(TG 99- GK)** had a chance on a save but the shot was perfect, TG are on the brink of elimination of gold medal contention!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!15' TG GOAL: **(TG 111)** takes a corner kick with a power low cross to the front of AC goal mouth that was timed perfectly with a cutting run of **(TG 2)** who stuck her leg out and redirected it into the net, no real chance to block the quick sequence of events for **(AC 250- GK)**, even the AC defense was a bit flat footed at this set piece, one more goal from TG and FM will be sent to Group A's basement!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' AC Sub: **(AC 1)** subs off for **(AC 11)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' TG Sub: **(TG 59)** subs off for **(TG 21)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' TG Miss: **(TG 2)** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot on target that **(AC 250- GK)** blocks but gives a huge rebound that **(TG 3)** shoots on target but **(AC 02)** blocks the shot, the ball rolls to the wing for **(TG 2)** to take another shot but her shot goes off target on the wide side, a goal kick for AC!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' TG Miss: **(TG 2)** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot on target that **(AC 250- GK)** blocks but gives a huge rebound that she chases and grabs!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' AC SKILLS: **(AC 33)** beautifully traps a high bouncing ball with her feet controlling it afterwards with a few dribble moves, not sure why these women aren't learning that trapping skill, it was executed with perfection by **(AC 33)** and with  **(TG 111)** on her back marking her, love to see the skills!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' AC Miss: **(AC 33)** intercepts a terrible cross pass by **(TG 3)**, she controls the ball and tries to dribble to the right wing for a better shot, as she is suffocated by **(TG 111)**'s tight defense, her shot is blocked by **(TG 111)**, **SooGuen** yells that her first touch should have been a one-time shot!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' TG Sub: **(TG 21)** subs off for **(TG 59)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' AC Miss &amp; FOUL: **(AC 33)** saves a ball from going out of bounds on the right wing sideline, she makes a cut down the wing with a dribble drawing two TG defenders on her, she then back passes to **(AC 8)** who is calling for a pass, who one-time shoots on target aimed for the top right corner, she hits the woodwork!, the ball bouncing back into play reaching into AC territory, but **(TG 3)** gains control, and starts to dribble forward with some focus, it's a one-on-one with **(TG 3)** and **(AC 02)** the two captains, **(AC 02)** fouls **(TG 3)** with the same left knee on left thigh/knee, **(TG 3)** goes down hard, the crowd and coaches are debating if this is a RED card offense, **Coach YoungPyo** thinks it's possible, **Coach ByungJi** is yelling for a red card, HOLY SHIT the red card is issued to **(AC 02)**, looks like the extra rule of a double red card issued to one player in the same game is that the player cannot play in the game anymore, so AC will not have a bench when the three minutes are up, **(AC 02)** is heading to the dressing room! insane!, a direct free kick is awarded too!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' TG Miss: **(TG 2)** takes the direct free kick with a shot on target that **(AC 11)** blocks the rebound goes out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' TG Miss: **(TG 3)** takes a corner kick with a set piece cross pass that **(TG 2)** jumps over and **(TG 111)** power one-times just off target to the wide side bottom left corner, missing by inches, **(AC 250- GK)** looked to be in great position to make a save!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' TG Miss: **(TG 111)** takes a sideline kick in deep in TG territory with a short pass to **(TG 2)** who turns around and speed dribbles to the opposite wing being chased by **(AC 8)**, she kicks it forward and **(AC 33)** messes the first touch and the ball re-directs towards the middle where **(TG 59)** is all alone, she controls the ball with a bit of dribbling and sets up for a shot that misses to the right side, a glorious chance missed, FM are cheering for the miss, the crowd goes wild!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' TG Miss: **(TG 3)** steals the thrown pass by **(AC 250- GK)** and takes a shot that looks to be way off target but the ball is blocked by **(AC 33)** and out of bounds to the sideline!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' TG Miss: **(TG 2)** takes the sideline kick in with a shot on target that **(AC 33)** blocks with her body and runs into **(TG 3)**, the ball goes out of bounds for a corner kick, the crowd watching are on their feet!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!20' Game Ends: we are going into a shoot-out that doesn't really matter, they missed their chances to get into the gold medal contention, even though they couldn't get a fourth goal or the two goal differential, TopGirl want to win one in shoot-out to end on a high note, goalies aren't changed!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!AC MISS: **AC SHOT 1**: **HyeJeong** shoots with power down the middle , **Ayumi** stands tall and blocks the ball!&lt; \n \nHighlights:&gt;!TG GOAL: **TG SHOT 1**: **BoKyung** shoots with power to the top left, **ChaeYoung** has no chance!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!AC MISS: **AC SHOT 2**: **JeeIn** shoots down the middle , **Ayumi** stands tall and blocks the ball, **Ayumi** is becoming emotional on the sidelines after her saves!&lt; \n \nHighlights:&gt;!TG GOAL: **TG SHOT 2**: **YuBin** shoots with power to the top left, **ChaeYoung** has no chance on the perfect shot!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!AC MISS: **AC SHOT 3**: **HeIn** shoots with power low and to the left, she hits the post, rebound pops back to the field!&lt; \n \nHighlights:&gt;!TG GOAL: **TG SHOT 3**: **Minzy** shoots down the middle and slightly to the left, **ChaeYoung** didnt even really try, a saveable ball!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!AC GOAL: **AC SHOT 4**: No Shot needed ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!&lt; \n \nHighlights:&gt;!TG GOAL: **TG SHOT 4**: No Shot needed ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!AC MISS: **AC SHOT 5**: No Shot needed ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!&lt; \n \nHighlights:&gt;!TG GOAL: **TG SHOT 5**: No Shot needed ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------!&lt; \n\n\nFINAL SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- **TG (3)3** - 3(0) AC------------, TG win but it's not enough to play for gold medal contention, they competed hard but AC come up big with enough to compete for gold medal aspirations,  I am sad my TG team couldn't get the result they needed but damn this was a banger of a match!&lt;\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!ChallengeLeague Drama - who will we see next week?  not sure as the clips are of all the ChallengeLeague teams competing hard to stay out of the

The players in the challenge league bring the smoke for every game and with everyone having a win it\u2019s gonna be heated. Those games the referee will prolly be the most important person because from the preview these games have the potential to get out of hand very quickly\ud83d\ude05 so excited and hyped",

What she did today **is totally different from her position** since she was the last wall behind Chae Ri Na to sweep or thread the loose ball on FWs to create counter and I\u2019m happy that Coach Lee Byung Ji put trust on her instead of exerting the offense thru already sealed Kim Bo Kyung and blunt Dayoung.\n\n\n&gt;FC Rumor \n\n\nI think FC Rumor is Kisum fan club before joining the show but yeah Yubin, Chae Ri Na and Ayumi always practice together. STG is Kim Ga Young, Hong Ja, Amy, Kisum, Kwak Min Jeong and Kim Bo Kyoung but sometimes they invite or plays with other players in show too. Giants formed a outside club too all the way since Season 1.\n\n\nMajority of players on show has or form clubs before and after join the show.

I dont think coach byungji brings enough to the table to increase the output of his players.  But this game was more of ayumi missing on key saves during regulation time.  She came up big with saves during the shoot-out.",

She missed a slow shot from HyeJung in the last game, but blocked massive shots from BoKyung and HeIn. I am not sure if they were too focused where they tensed up, or not focus enough, where they missed all those easy balls.\n\nI think that Ayumi lost her focus through out the game which is evidence with the 1st goal and 3rd one. The 2nd one might be positioning, but she has always been excellent in picking her spot. I gonna chalked it up to the curse of getting married. I love her from the very beginning when Coach JinChul threw the ball at her and she flinched (hilarious),but this game was such a let down",

Where as we can feel Coach JinChul, unlike the sweet daddy persona are tough on his players. Same thing also can be seen with WorldClass coach and Gavengers coach. I think thats why we can see massive growth on those teams. Bullabang coach JJJ seems like a nice guys, like Coach HongMin (FC Ananconda) but they are smart enough to develop a team based on the team strength and weakness.\n\nCoaches do matter with these teams.",

I absolutely love how she has the natural instinct and touch to touch-pass the ball when it comes to her. However it comes to her she often just hits it with her foot as it's moving and puts it in position for a teammate, usually Bokyung, to take possession and go. Getting that from a newbie seems so rare. Add in her field positioning awareness and her natural athleticism and it's so easy to see why she has ace potential. I don't think she'll be a superstar at any one thing but a + player in every area making her an overall ++ player. Just a bummer she missed that last shot. Understandable, but dang it would have just supercharged her status as an ascending + player. \n2. The development of Yubin has been something I've enjoyed and mentioned for a while but she just continues to look great. As far as defenders go, she must be the best at this point. + defense skills, understanding of the game and positioning but then + skills have developed with her passing, her dribbling and her passing. I don't think any defender is better on corner set pieces when you want a defender to receive the pass and then shoot from the half field line. \n3. It's such a bummer to see Ayumi regress. Of course accidents happen and such but this is just bad play and rookie mistakes. The star goalies (Irene, Ayumi, etc) are falling off and the young hotness are killing it; Minseo and Kisum. The only old guard left who is good is Hye-Ryun Cho and besides her only Myung Seohyun looks promising. Though, while there might be no better option, it's still a damn shame to have Seohyun playing goalie and not offense. \n4. Top Girl needs something. Dayoung taking that next big step forward between seasons, Bokyung needs to take another step forward and improve her individual dribbling skills (start to look more like Lee Jung-eun) so she can break through defenses, and Ayumi either needs to re-engage with her development or quit the show and Top Girl find a new goalie who is younger and more athletic. Bokyung at first was so far above everyone else that she seemed dominate, but while everyone else, especially defenders, developed quickly, she has developed really slowly. But it's not like she doesn't practice a ton and play lots of futsal matches (matches for fun + the league she's in). So I don't really get why her dribbling isn't even near Seogi's level yet, let alone Lee Jung-eun. \n5. We didn't see much but the new member who joined Actionsita looks really promising. She seemed to naturally put herself in good position on the field and in practice she was kicking the ball really, really well with accuracy, power and technique. She could easily be another Dayoung type who is a natural athlete who takes to soccer/futsal really quickly and has a high (++) talent ceiling. Just what Actionista needs since they lost Yeo-jin. \n6. Prediction: Giants versus World Class for the Championship.",

And she is already very good as a casual player\n\nBut what she can DO improve is her football IQ. Both Bokyung and HyeIn are way too tunnel visioned. The last season final first goal was the best example. There's a super obvious key pass and shooting was never a good option \n\nPark Ha Na looks amazing.

They have always been confident in her, that the two defenders RiNa and YuBin have grown their skills so much where they can also be an attcking defenders. This regress will make them not as aggressive as they have been. Please come back to us, Ayumi!",

The tactics themselves are fine but it's like he tells the players WHAT to do but not HOW to do it. He just assumes the players will figure it out on their own. This cost the national team the final in season 1. Kim Bo Kyung today looked more threatening on the right rather than left since she likes to dribble very close to the line and carry the ball forward herself. She can't do this as well on the left where she doesn't have enough room and looked flustered at times. Still, I think if she had better coaching, she would've been a lot better even on the left.\n\nLee Young Jin looks like her health is deteriorating being covered in patches. This could be a big problem for actionistas. They are over reliant on Jung Hye In as is. She is defending and attacking more than anyone else. If Young Jin gets injured and Hye In has to defend even more, I think they stand no chance against giants.",

    "postText": "[Star News](https://star.mt.co.kr/stview.php?no=2021082411370945982) \n\nTranslation: \n\n\"Sixth Sense 2\" will cast two more extended and trendy guests thanks to hot love.\n\nAccording to a Star News report on the 24th, rappers Loco and Gray will appear as guests for tvN's entertainment program \"Sixth Sense 2.\" In addition, \"Sixth Sense 2,\" which was originally scheduled for the 12th episode, will be extended twice thanks to enthusiastic support from viewers, and the season 2 will be completed with a total of 14 episodes on September 24.\n\n\"Sixth Sense\" is an unpredictable sixth sense deception variety where six cast members find fake ones that are more real than the real ones hiding inside. Following season 1 that aired in September last year, season 2 was broadcasted this year and gained huge love. Yoo Jae-seok, Mi-Joo, Onara, Jeon So-min, Jessie, and Lee Sang-yeop appear to show different chemistry.\n\nIn particular, the 9th episode of \"Sixth Sense 2,\" which aired on the 20th, recorded an average of 3.8 percent and a maximum of 5.6 percent based on households in the Seoul metropolitan area, breaking its own record. (based on Nielsen Korea)\n\nMeanwhile, \"Sixth Sense 2\" airs every Friday at 8:40 p.m.\n\n----------------------\n\nCongrats Sixth Sense cast &amp; crew, they totally deserve it and season 3 please!",

If they buy these places, they can turn around and sell for a profit after renovations. Or, they can negotiate renovations with the landlord for free use for a month. It's probably the same cost as building sets on a lot for a normal show.",

I figure the greater expressiveness goes hand in hand with the translation anyway.  I don\u2019t know how to assess his Tagalog-to-Korean translation; I assume it got the job done.\n\nAs always, it\u2019s a pleasure when an international celebrity is elated to be on Running Man; we got to see giggly, giddy Manny again.  And not only did he invite the RM cast over for lunch and play the game, he fed the crew, too!  A stand-up dude.",

            "comment": "I expected this episode to be really awkward. What I got? A really fun and memorable episode, and imo one of the best episodes of the entire year.\r  \nGoing to Manny's house (more like a super expensive resort hotel) and seeing all the things inside was a treat. Wow that place is stunning! I'm sure Manny wanted to show it off but who wouldn't when they have an awesome place like this. It's actually a perfect place for Running Man to do an episode, as we'll soon see. \r  \nManny was a good sport about everything and like Jaesuk said, Manny seemed a lot more comfortable this episode. In fact, his first appearance on RM in Korea was not bad but it did feel awkward. I didn't feel any awkwardness at all this episode. I would attribute that to the fact that he was in his own home AND the translator Ryan Bang was really good. I definitely think the translator deserves a lot of the credit for how good this episode went because they translated things fluidly and enthusiastically. Even Jaesuk joked that the translator was making things more exaggerated than what was originally said. But I think that's actually a good thing since it put everyone in a good mood. The translator diligently followed Manny around and actually looked close enough to resemble a good friend of Manny's! \r  \nManny was a lot of fun. He totally got into the jokes and played along when RM would joke with him. He definitely had a good time. I could also tell he loved hiding those coins for the coin hunting game. He even tried to give people subtle hints to help them find the coins. I was actually surprised he let everyone dig around his house to find coins but apparently he was totally okay with it. That's awesome. I actually thought it was adorable how much Manny liked Somin. How can you blame him? Somin is a ball of sunshine, always laughing and smiling and doing funny things. Manny not only gave Somin the early bonus coins but helped her find the hidden coins and even gave her some extra when Somin without hesitation jumped into the pool and was unable to get the coins in the pool. \r  \nSo even though there was a language barrier, it didn't matter. The translator really helped and just being courteous and fun-loving goes a long way. It looked like everyone had a good time. And what I thought would be a cringe-inducing episode turned into one of my favorite Running Man episodes. \r  \nThe last portion of the episode at the Running Man resort was still a lot of fun. It wasn't anything ground breaking but it felt refreshing. The members getting to relax but also messing around while trying to earn / steal more R coins. Even trying to pick the \"break coupon\" was quite entertaining. Classic Running Man. With how fun this episode was, I'm bummed there isn't one more episode in the Philippines.\r  \ntldr: Even after that epic episode 650 concert, this is still one of the best Running Man episodes of the year!",

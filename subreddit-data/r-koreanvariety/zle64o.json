I love the cast and their banter but it seems as though there have been fewer guests and even when the guest attend the show, it isn't seen as a big deal. I know covid affected the show and I like them involving regular citizens as guests but I think it's very interesting to see how the show will develop now that it's less physical. \n\nI don't know if the time slot change is signaling maybe a decline/end of the Sunday night domination but I do wonder if the internet variety programs are giving the tv programs a run for their money.",

Ratings is not only the main metric for a show's success since Running Man is still earning a lot of money through OTT channels overseas and youtube. It's still one of the consistently most watched variety shows out there by non Koreans. And regarding guests I think they're not really worried with that. BTS Jin just appeared this year. I mean there's nothing more high profile than that.",

                    "comment": "I agree.  The producers did several episodes where the regular cast just chatted with each other, and made the point that it was because that was what people enjoyed the most about the show.  I'm sure they did research in Korea at least, maybe internationally too.  But i believe that people still enjoy the show in it's new form.\n\nAnd while it is awkward to see guests that DO appear get so little attention, it says something that the show doesn't NEED guests most of the time.\n\nPersonally i started watching when Somin and Sechan joined, so i never really got married to one format or another.  I just like the cast and especially Somin, who is a true variety gem.  All of the cast are important though, and even when they tried to change things up and let go of KJK and SJH the public wouldn't let them.\n\nRunning Man is whatever Running Man does, tbh.  YJS talked about the \"dying art of variety\" and the need to (a) keep it going, and (b) train up new variety performers.  So i think he'll want to keep this show for a long time.",

The best part of RM in it's heyday were the games, but if the cast can't do it anymore, I want some youngsters who can. Of course, it'll be hard to get people to watch since this cast already has like 12+ years of experience and people are really attached to the cast chemistry. But, RM to me lately is just really repetitive (of course, not insulting you if you like it, some people like the toned down pace) and I want some creativity and spark like the earlier episodes.",

Park PD of Earth Arcade mentioned in an interview that they havent gotten the older demographic yet. Which directly implies the ratings they had (which is actually decent  (3.5% - 5%) is mostly on the younger side. Imo, it just implies that when a show is liked by the certain demographic, they will watch it on tv. Its the same with dramas that hit 15%+ (right now its SJK's Reborn Rich).\n\nI also think this is the dilemma of KB today also. Their ratings around pandemic times fluctuate between the GP and the older demographic. But their online content are skewed towards the younger demo. But now this year it seems GP left them and now it relies on the older demo based on the ratings (barely getting 3%).",

There were many great episodes after his departure and the cast and crew did all they could to make up for it and sometimes they actually managed... But the man was the show. You say running man, and JaeSuk and KwangSoo come to mind. It is what it is. Yea, all the other members are awesome too; but there's no denying those two have carried hard for years. Without him, things just haven't been the same. \n\nAnd it didn't need to be the same, change can be good. The problem is, the dynamics changed and the one person who could handle every other person is now no longer there. So the entire thing is just unbalanced now. Exhibit A: episode 628. There is no way that episode would be that bad if LKS was there to interfere with YJS and KJK. RM doesn't have anyone in their current lineup who can do what he did. It's like the combination of JSM, Haha, and JSJ sometimes are able to fill that void but it sometimes just doesn't work with 3 people. It needs one person. It needs a KwangSoo. \n\nSo yeah, as much as I don't like saying this, the show has been on a steady decline since episode 592 ish. There are fun episodes and moments here and there, but barely in the double digits out of the last 40-50 episodes. \n\nAnother thing is that the cast doesn't really seem to care about helping out the guests or rather they don't have time to do it; so they won't be holding their hands or helping them with their screentime. Unless they're BTS or international gold medalist level famous. The cast is too busy one upping each other and trying to be funny and creating scenes to be looking after guest. SJH can't even get herself screentime let alone a guest. JSJ is too busy being the butt of every joke. YSC and KJK play to win, and they don't have the skills or character on the show to really be of any help to a guest. JSM used to be super helpful to male guests by her love frog character, but after years of abuse and getting called names for doing that, I don't even blame her for stopping it. She hasn't done that character in ages, and the male guests suffer because of it because that was an \"easy\" and sure way to give them exposure and screentime. Female guests? That was KwangSo's job even when he was dating. YSC just can't do it.* YJS and Haha are the only ones who can kind of help out, but then again, they're mostly too busy making fun of the cast to fill the time. \n\nSo, why would people want to go on running man? If you're not a variety veteran or good at variety, close to the cast (SeHo) or a huge star then you're not gonna get Much screentime. Isn't it better to go somewhere you don't have to compete with some of the best variety personalities for screentime? Much less stressful and ultimately Better for your career and PR.",

No. He did all of that, tried his darnest to win, and end up somehow in the most epic of ways losing and then getting the penalty. \ud83d\ude02 So, it sort of ended up not working out for him, or you could even say it was like he got punished (getting the penalty) for all the cheating and dirty tricks. Which is why at least I found it much easier to forgive him for all of that and never sensed that he was serious. \n\nYSC on the other hand... He cheats, lies and steals and then just doesn't own up to it. I remember the episode with penthouse cast (women) he stole JSJ's money and just never even brought it up until everyone forgot, and JSJ got the penalty too. Or he would go as far as bringing up people's actual real life trauma to win a silly game, and make it look like he was just being fair. (Bringing up JSM's cheating ex and relating him to her work as an actress was and will always be one of the worst moments on the show to me. So unnecessary, unfunny and disrespectful). \n\nHe is for sure an important part of the show, but he definitely isn't even close to being able to fill LKS shoes. Not in the games, not in betrayals, not in comedy, and definitely not when it comes to handling the guest. I'm afraid it's also just unfair to expect him to do that. His whole persona is different. \n\nAnd I realize my comment reads like slander, but it isn't meant to be. This is personal opinion. I don't find him quite as annoying as many others do, but he does have moments where I just think he needs to be quiet and give it a rest. Like him teasing the opposite team in the episode after Covid quaranti with SeHo guesting. JSJ and KJK at one point actually completely seriously said he was being too annoying that day. Haha joked that he just looked uglier that day, so his annoyingness was extra because of that. (Pointing this out to say, Haha is a genius at times with his comments) it's very much a special talent to be able to \"annoy\" and tease and clown others without actually being annoying/rude/disrespectful and I feel that YSC doesn't quite understand where that line is. JSM and LKS and Haha do. YJS? Master at it. \n\nI think it's because after all their teasing, those few are willing to take it too. They dish it out, but can take it just as well. They accept the fate of getting smacked or yelled at or pushed, and laugh it off. So it makes their teasing come off as even less serious and more playful. YSC not so much. He fights back and can't take it.",

That's the power of this type of character, but just open up instagram and YouTube and read all the \"she's making male guest uncomfortable\" comments. No wonder she's stopped doing it. The female guest didn't get much attention because there was no LKS and YSC isn't doing that type of character, and she was like 27 so it would be creepy to pair her with KJK.\n\nI hope I'm making it clear I'm talking about their characters and roles here.",

The games used to be exciting and funny because it is ridiculous by itself.\n\nI agree completely. The quality of the games and concepts make a huge difference in how enjoyable the show is.\n\nIn the past they used to have great and funny concepts. Superpower Soccer, Animal Race, Yoomes Bond, etc. Granted those are more physically taxing but that was the golden age of RM where it is the funniest and had the biggest scale in setup and games.\n\nThe most recent good concept that I enjoyed was the Tazza one where they gambled for caramel candy.\n\nThere was a period of time (I can't remember which PD was it) where the PD kept doing Prisoner's Dilemma sort of games to encourage betrayal. (Betrayal is fun to watch in small doses when you don't expect it, but if every single moment is every member trying to betray each other, it gets old really fast.) But what makes the games of that era boring for me is that the earlier games almost had no impact as the final game tend to have the 'all or nothing' aspect or a ridiculous amount of reward that can turn the rankings around. To me that just makes it uninteresting to watch.",

No because it doesn't have to be one or the other in a sense that the youtube channels could be additional avenue to promote the celebrities' works. \n\n\nRunning Man also has the advantage of a broader international fan base. With kpop/kdrama becoming more and more global, promoting via RM could reach wider audience than most of the Korean youtuber channels, especially when some are still without english subs.",

In my opinion, older RM had that special vibe where anyone could watch an episode and be entertained. Meanwhile current RM is most enjoyable if you already like the members and their chemistry i.e., it's not so easy to watch if you aren't already invested.\n\nBut I'm happy to see the members having fun every week. I'm aware that the show could end any time and I think they're aware of that too. So they're doing whatever they want right now without stressing, and I like that vibe\n\n&gt;I don't know if the time slot change is signaling maybe a decline/end of the Sunday night domination\n\nAre you referring to RM shifting to a later time slot? It's happened before, and it's not necessarily a bad thing for RM. It just means that SBS isn't confident about Master in The House season 2 and wants to give it a timeslot that's less competitive. At the end of the day, RM has huge brand value, still has a considerable international fanbase, and gets product placements frequently. I'm sure SBS is satisfied.",

            "comment": "Actually it has been a while since since FTA (Free-to-Air) TV variety shows stopped being a preferred promotion schedule for Idols.\n\nBefore the rise of Youtube variety shows, most Idol groups / singers already have their own youtube channels where behind-the-scenes and day-to-day footages are being uploaded. (Eg: Mamamoo has MMMTV on their youtube channel where they used to post such stuff prior to their comebacks and even mini games / variety show style videos for their debut anniversaries).\n\nAlso there is a preference for music and talk shows and over non-music variety shows for promotions. So idols / singers will go for the usual music shows for each channels + YHY Sketchbook (before it got cancelled). Though weirdly some of the bigger groups will go to Knowing Bros to promote even though KB's viewership has been declining. Maybe it is to show KHD respect?\n\nThere is also a barrier of entry / requirement to be able to promote well on game-show type of programmes. They must be able to 'secure air-time' either by being stupid/silly/slapstick (which the agency may not be the image that the agency want for their celebs) or by being good at games (physically or mentally). Especially against the RM members which most are variety veterans with all their in-jokes, lovelines, personas and history, it can be really difficult to secure screentime.\n\nI believe that cost is an issue as well. Agencies need to pay the shows to come on for promotion. So for the smaller agencies with less established idols/singers, it may not be worth their while to promote on non-music variety shows.\n\nAs for actors promoting their shows, if you paid enough attention, you will realised that they will only promote dramas from the same channel. Some examples are Running Man (SBS) promoted Penthouse (SBS), Amazing Saturday (TVN) promoted Work Later, Drink Now (TVN), 2D1N (KBS) promoted Curtain Call (KBS). So if an actor is promoting their work before or while it is airing, it is most definitely from the same network.\n\nThen add the rise of youtube variety shows to the mix where the filming probably takes less time versus a traditional variety show, the hosts are younger and less intimidating.\n\nSo all in all, decline in guesting is not just a Running Man thing, but an industry-wide thing that has been happening over the past 4-5 years.\n\nAs for the change in timeslot or the \"end of the Sunday night domination\", Running Man hasn't been dominating anything in a long time. SBS hasn't been able to revive it but at the same time it is still too big to change, scrap or cancel for SBS. The change in timeslot puts Running Man directly competing with 2D1N which is pretty ballsy since 2D1N is extremely popular. Perhaps SBS thinks that timeslot is better since it is the 'dinner time show' timing and their main audience (elementary school kids) can control the remote? \n\nAlthough TV ratings don't tell the full picture of how popular a show due to VODs and a lot of working Koreans don't watch shows during TV broadcast anymore.",

I agree with most of our comments. \n\nGuests have many more choices on how to promote themselves and their work these days. They probably see variety shows as supplementary nowadays vs at the start of RM\u2019s run when many a career or international fame was launched by guesting on RM. Also - as YJS mentioned in the talk-specific episode (right after LKS left), the show consciously shifted their focus away from being so guest-centric. \n\nAlso wanted to add on to your final comments about ratings and VOD. As many have referenced, Running Man TV ratings have been stagnant or slowly on the decline for a while now, but their VOD popularity has remained quite high, even in Korea. I read somewhere last year that apart from one or two of the dramas that made it really big in 2021, that RM had the highest hours streamed on VODs.\n\nETA: spelling",

            "comment": "Popular celebrities generally visit popular variety shows to promote their current works or themselves. But I don't think the way RM is going right now would do much for the popular celebrities to achieve these goals due to several reasons: 1) it's time consuming: RM generally take a whole day to record, compared this to youtube channel recording which generally can be done much more quickly; 2) as some have mentioned here, the regular casts seem to be the main point of attraction for RM. while comedians, idols, &amp; some models might be more willing to make a fool of themselves to pull attentions to themselves, actors or actresses especially the popular ones are generally more reserved and are not used to the variety shows shootings.\n\nIn the past, the guests can show a bit more of their real self by going through the physical actions or being strategic/tactical or even showing a bit of their acting skills during the races. But nowadays in RM, the casts spend most of the time talking whether it's the start of the show, during the moves in the bus or car, when playing the games (quizzes or gesture games or jokgu), etc. Even with all these talks however, viewers or the fans of the guests can only get little new information about the guests or their works they are promoting bcoz most of the talks are just small talks. If this is the case, wouldn't it better for the guests to just go to shows where they can just sit and talk about themselves or the works or whatever topics in more depth where there is only 1 or 2 regular casts as interviewers? I think this is why some young idol groups prefer to go to Kim Jongkook's channel than go to RM. It's just more reasonable to do so.",

    "postText": "Episode 91 will be our final warm up match before re-visiting Jeolla- do soccer team, the painful memory of our first Title Match defeat. \n\n'Extra Pay System' will be introduced in this episode. \n\nSuper Save and assisting the goal will get 50,000 won. The goal-scorer itself will be getting 100,000 won. \n\nThe next line up of Eojjeda Avengers will show the possible resurrection of Kim Jun Hyeon alongside Lee ji Hwan and Andre Jin. The taste of demotion will surely bring out the best in them but the question of maintaining their position in the team will be answered in the future episodes of Eojjeoda Avengers. \n\nEp89 we got defeated by Sun Fc and in the Ep90 we won the game against the professional women's soccer team. Some said we are nothing but a bully, only knows how to win a game against women. \"Why don't you play against a professional men's soccer team?.\" \"You should have win against Sun Fc.\" \"Let's Play Soccer PD, go learn from Choikang Monster PD instead.\" (A Clean Sweep- a Baseball TV show by JTBC). Said K-Nets in the JTBC YT Channel's  comment section.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, our players will have a Title Match against Jeju soccer team this Wednesday. I will keep you up to date if we got lucky with pics and vids by K-Nets. Not a chance for the match result unless there is a saint out there. Whatever they do, I hope they will win the game. (It's a plus if my bias assisted and scored a lot too. Hehehehehehehehehehe).\n\n'16 Entry System' and 'Extra Pay System.' Will these be the future of Eojjeoda Avengers? When the competition between players are hot than ever and the money involves around the supposed-entertaining soccer TV show, who will have the last laugh and who will grinding their teeth to the end ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(P.S. I just found that AJH is the PD for Lets Play Soccer. The man seriously needs some guidance from the professional).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/134c9uu)",

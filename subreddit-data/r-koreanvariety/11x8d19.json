And I have a 'innate' respect for LSM as a fellow musician.\n\nThe odd thing? I'm older than all of them lol\nSo I may see things a bit differently. ;)",

Many 2nd generation idols and many comedians shined through the shows where KHD was main host. He is also not afraid to be outshined and many people like LSGi or Leeteuk became good at hosting after learning from him. \n\nI don't know, I like his obnoxious, noisy and sometime cute persona so much lol. Since I gave up on KB long ago and without new seasons of GE or NJTTW I was catching myself that I missed his energy in shows I am currently watching.",

Although, I agree that probably none of them are continue dating irl. just want to stir some controversy but Minha and Jiyu seems closer in this and they were sporting a couple look in the 2nd meetup. (maybe just because they hardly had an interaction in the show.)\n\nAnyway, i wish it has captions, so at least i can auto translate it to english. when they reacted to the show though, and the 2 ladies teared up. The ending is heartbreaking in her end and I think what she felt is really genuine.",

Copy and paste this for nearly all the Korean dating shows.",

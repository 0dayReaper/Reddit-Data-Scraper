    "postText": "'Peak Time' is a brand-new idol competition program in which teams battle for the chance to become the next worldwide idol group. Unlike other audition programs, its contestants consist entirely of male idols who have already debuted, whether currently active or part of a disbanded group.\n\nOnly the top 6 finalists would be able to reveal their group name on the show, and those 6 teams would be participating in a \u201cPeak Time\u201d concert tour. The final winner will receive a grand prize of 300 million won (approximately $232,932), as well as the opportunity to release a new album and hold a global showcase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Round 2 Combined Unit Match Round:**\n\nA training camp was held for 3 days and 2 nights. During the training camp, they will prepare for round 2. Out of the 16 teams, 4 teams become one combined team. Each team will form a vocal, dance, and rap unit. The vocal unit must have a maximum of 6 members. The rap unit must have a maximum of 5 members. The dance unit does not have a maximum number of members. The units of the four teams will compete. The winning unit of each position will be selected by the judges.\n\nThe winner of each match earns 2% of the total votes. The MVP of each unit will receive 5% of the total votes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Team|Members|\n|:-|:-|\n|Team A|9:00 (&gt;!BLITZERS!&lt;), 2:00 (&gt;!NTX!&lt;), 18:00 (&gt;!BDC!&lt;), and 5:00 (&gt;!ATBO!&lt;)|\n|Team B|20:00 (&gt;!M.O.N.T!&lt;), 8:00 (&gt;!DKB!&lt;), 21:00 (&gt;!24K!&lt;), and 23:00 (&gt;!DGNA!&lt;)|\n|Team C|11:00 (&gt;!VANNER!&lt;), 13:00 (&gt;!BAE173!&lt;), 15:00 (&gt;!BLK!&lt;), and 24:00 (&gt;!Soloists\\*!&lt;)|\n|Team D|7:00 (&gt;!MASC!&lt;), 14:00 (&gt;!GHOST9!&lt;), 4:00 (&gt;!BXB!&lt;), and 1:00 (&gt;!DIGNITY!&lt;)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Unit|Performance|Score|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Rap Unit - Team A|[If I Die Tomorrow (orig.

My bag team was good too!! Sad for the other 2 teams though, Fiance and If I die tomorrow is just too difficult imo even if they are skilled!&lt;\n\n&gt;!That My Sea short spoiler!!! I honestly thought that team was at a disadvantage because it is a IU song because like jay park said how bold of them but I guess I might be totally wrong!!!&lt;\n\nReally a good survival show. No drama just skilled people all trying their best! And sad that eliminations will be coming soon :(",

            "comment": "I think by design, the focus of this show is giving a good performance. Unlike the other concurrent show, that having an end goal to make a great 'product'. And that really change the fundamental of Peak Time. It has similarity with KBS Immortal Show, where the song and performance itself would be the priority. Drama is a bonus, not the main dish. Which is I personally love. And that is make this show personally enjoyable for me. \n\nEven combine unit segment also based on that. The design making their growth journey feels 'healty'. Really waiting for the next episode. That &gt;!My Sea!&lt; cliffhanger really killed me.\n\nAlso, OP, IMO this part should be a spoiler, since it only announced on this episode. \ud83e\udd23\n&gt; &gt;!The MVP of each unit will receive 5% of the total votes.!&lt;",

Just like Kingdom or queendom, the 'prize' I think just for the sake, and not gonna generate the most amazing buzz anyway. All team have to makes a lot screen time during the show airing. Unless somehow, later episode, if this show gotten as popular as SWF, then the prize would be more impactfull. The more important thing is how they perform, that really brings excitement (at least for me), in every episode.",

            "comment": "I'll admit, a bit embarrassingly, that I refreshed multiple times until the ep came out with subs. Rooting for Team B even if it is obvious they're the frontrunner. I actually liked Team C's rap song better when I first watched it on youtube but watching the whole ep like this, there's just no beating Team B's rap team because even I thought I was watching Show Me The Money. \n\nIt's weird that they're splitting up the vocals like this but since I wasn't psyched with Team C's vocal perf I don't actually mind. Next ep, I'm super looking forward to Team B's vocal team, whom I think are easily the best singers in the show overall, and Team D given that preview. \n\nAlso I noticed, even if Team B doesn't win this round overall, since it's comprised of the top ranking teams (23:00 at 2nd, 20:00 at 5th, 8:00 at 7th, and 21:00 at 12th), I don't think they'll actually be hurt that much by the 2% or even the MVP 5% loss. Especially after Siwoo?'s perf this ep, 21:00 will get a boost. Even without taking into account those votes, the skill level and team energy is like Jay Park said, they're so much farther ahead of the other teams that it's honestly baffling how they came out this way when they were \"supposedly\" nerfed by taking out team 14:00. It made me feel a bit bad when those teams from A, D, and even a few from C during the perfs just looked despondent and said they wished it ended already so they can go. So far the show has stayed wholesome, fun and void of any drama so I hope it stays entertaining till the end and the teams that put in the effort and show great perfs get the concert and since I'm now biased, team 23:00 gets the album release and prize money.",

    "postText": "This all started with Sexyama lol. \n\nSo I've watched variety shows for a while now, and I've always known him as Sarang's dad (saw them all the way back when TROS first started \ud83e\udd7a). Heck, I thought *everyone* knew he had a daughter. But after Physical 100, he's gained a *ton* of new fans, especially international ones. \n\nMost of his old insta posts had people commenting about his boxing legacy, or his variety appearances with Dongmin, but now it's all about P100. A lot of people are also commenting about how they \"found\" him after his P100 entrance, as if he doesn't practically make me shit my pants in his old boxing matches (can still hear his intro song lol). \n\nWho are some other variety stars who left the limelight for a bit but had a revival with a new batch of fans? Right now, the only one I can kinda think of is Soogeun, but that's only bc of his scandal.",

Eventually she and Song Euni started their podcast and that turned things around.  She was then on a we got married style show for people in their 40s called \"With You\" in 2015.  Her partner was Yoon Jungsoo, who had a lot of financial issues.  She told him don't worry, she'll work and make all the money and that was it.  Ajumma girl crush.  That's when I found her and fell for her charms.  She was such a boss with him, it was so refreshing to see.\n\nSince then she has done a lot and even won a Daesang in 2020 from KBS.  But that show really helped move her career to center stage.",

Then he had a string of daebak shows in 2015-16 and went right back to the top.\n\nNoh Hongchul had a drink-driving scandal in 2014 (and I seem to recall he had something else since?

He was *the* pioneer of YouTube variety shows like Workman, like kids *loved* him. \n\nAlthough I miss Wassup Man, I'm kinda glad he stopped. Once he came back after COVID cases lowered, it still didn't feel right. They still had to take breaks every few weeks because of case peaks, and even then, they couldn't travel all that much anymore.

She's helped raising awareness for ADHD spectrum with her son, and is seen in a new light than her Y2K variety princess/\"Dangyunhaji queen\" era image.\n\nAlso I'm seeing Park Misun get a lot of appreciation and being rediscovered through her more \"mature\" variety show hostings such as High School Mom or the other talk show where they invite women who have problems, and a lot of people are calling her wise and well-informed. I really appreciate that! \n\nThen there's the most SHINING example, Tanaka (a.k.a Kim Kyungwook of Namolla Family), who has been doing his Tanaka shtick since 5 years and has only recently blown the heck up again after being known for being in Namolla Family.\n\n(Also on an unrelated note but it's kinda funny how celeb couples or families \"\"\"\"\"use\"\"\"\" each other for bettering each other's images lol. Like, for example, Choi Minsu lands in the court room ~~once again~~ and the next thing you know is Kang June doing something on TV, often telling funny and heartwarming stories of him or how he courted her. Like, girl, I get it you're tryna salvage your man's rep, and lowkey paying his bail, a wife's gotta do what a wife's gotta do... but why does it lowkey hurt? idk why maybe because she so rarely talks about herself? It's like she has accepted that the industry sees her as nothing more than the woman that got to marry Choi Minsu at the peak of his career, when she is so much more than that. Heck, she was a Miss Korea pageant, is basically a \"socialite\" and host/presenter for basically every second foreign company event in Korea, is on the education board, a homeshopping presenter, fluent in Korean and English, a mother of two well-raised boys, and an icon in the gyopo community, but it seems like she doesn't know it herself lol)",

Basically all related to anger management issues. There's a seperate section on his wikipedia for that, and every time he just ends up in this sad af state and then June comes to the rescue and literally manages to salvage his image every damn time.\n\nThat's also the reason she has so much \"control\" over him, because she's the only one whom he'll actually listen to. Her being literally so protective basically keeps him from pulling even more shit. (Even then, the most recent case happened was 2019, another rash driving case, and again she went on TV). Ngl she's such a strong woman for literally powering through all of this. More power to her ngl\n\nSome people misunderstand it and are like \"she's being overcontrolling\", but god knows she's the only reason he hasn't spent a lifetime in jail and therapy, and he knows too (which is why he literally does as she says no ifs no buts. She's like his voice of reason)",

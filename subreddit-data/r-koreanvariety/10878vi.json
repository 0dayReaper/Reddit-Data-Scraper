The cast had chemistry too.\n\nUgh Heart Signal was so fun. Made my heart flutter and made me wait every week.",

On Heart Signal everyone knew who got the votes since they were sitting next to each other in their rooms and could hear each others phones go off so I always felt bad for the ones who didn't get votes!&lt;",

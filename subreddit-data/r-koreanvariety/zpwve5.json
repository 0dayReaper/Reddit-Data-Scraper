            "comment": "Check these threads for more info on where to watch Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows: **https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/znemtw/i_fell_in_love_with_korean_dating_shows/j0h5xw3/** and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/ https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zlml4b/ramyun_chill_episode_5_finale_221214/j06e2lh/\n\n---\n\nTry **Pink Lie**, **Heart Signal**, **Love Catcher**, **Between Love and Friendship**, **I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO (/r/IamSolo)**, and so on for Korean dating shows. Check the above and below thread links for the other Korean dating shows.\n\n**Love Catcher in Bali** has really nice visuals, it's actually unbeatable so far, https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zpnb19/which_dating_show_in_your_opinion_has_the_most/j0u1g0y/. But ya watch the earlier seasons first, particular Love Catcher 2 as that's often considered the best in the series.\n\nThere's also the **Chinese version of Love Catcher, it's called The Secret X (\u673a\u667a\u7684\u604b\u7231)**, Episode 1 from iQIYI Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTj-dJkp8o\n\nFor Chinese dating shows, try **Shanghai Sharelife** (/r/Shanghaisharelife) if you haven't already, it's the Chinese version of Terrace House. Oh and if you haven't watched Terrace House: Boys x Girls Next Door, **this is kinda how to watch Terrace House: Boys x Girls Next Door: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zfkwnq/how_do_i_watch_boys_girls_next_door/izchnov/**\n\nThere's the **Chinese version of Heart Signal** (it has 5 seasons now), this is kinda how to watch those, basically it's on Viki and WeTV/Tencent Video: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zotwct/watched_heart_signal_2_ep_1_and_im_already_hooked/j0pawb3/\n\n---\n\n**Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81)** is kinda like Ainori Love Wagon but in China. Basically they're university students that are having a field trip, lol. So they get missions/dates/etc. They got them islands.\n\nTwinkle Love has a lot of friendships formed in the show. Like it's one of the best shows for that, you can see them shipping each other and so on, lmao.\n\nTwinkle Love is available on YOUKU or the YOUKU channel(s) on Youtube. This is particularly good if you want to go back/forward to that freshness of young adult life ([btw, flamingos and parrots are geese] (https://www.reddit.com/r/heartsignal/comments/ns11y8/friends_share_life_terrace_house_twinkle_love/)).\n\nFor Twinkle Love, at the end of each day they have to record a message for the person they liked/spent time the most. And listen to their own message (through earbuds) IN FRONT OF EVERYONE, so it's kinda dramatic af, lol.\n\nTwinkle Love or \u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81 Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxP-Ye9kr24\n\nTwinkle Love Season 2 Episode 1 Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78vUkTAhuG8\n\n---\n\n**Relationship S3/Let's Fall In Love Season 3 (\u6211\u4eec\u604b\u7231\u5427 \u7b2c\u4e09\u5b63)**, Episode 1 from YOUKU Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JprQ5Fd4Qo.\n\nRelationship S3/Let's Fall In Love Season 3 has that chillax vibe to it. This was unexpectedly so good for me due to the cast/location/etc.\n\nLet's Fall In Love Season 3 is a more mature or really laidback version of these dating shows though as they're in a somewhat rural/etc. area (city of Dali by Erhai Lake in Yunnan, southwest China) and so there's less of that hustle feeling. Some shots of this show really gives you that slice of life bliss.\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iyso9ql/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/zbgsso/has_anyone_found_a_good_replacement_for_terrace/iz8ayph/**\n\n---\n\nThere was finally a modern Korean drama version of **UnREAL with Rachel or Shiri Appleby**. In UnREAL they show you how shows like The Bachelor and so on are produced, lol.\n\nThat Kdrama is called **Love is for Suckers** (has Lee Da-hee and Choi Si-won), it just finished two weeks ago. Kingdom of Love 2 (the dating reality show inside Love is for Suckers) is mainly based around probably I Am Solo and so on, like if you watch I Am Solo you'll see familiar stuff, references, et cetera.\n\nIf you want to skip the drama and go straight behind the curtain for how dating shows are made, start at Episode 5/6 as that's when they actually begin the Kingdom of Love 2 dating show, lol.",

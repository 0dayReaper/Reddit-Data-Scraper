The status bars have also not changed once since December.\n\nAnyone know the current status? Tried reaching them via Twitter but no reply. The other episodes are available with machine generated subs, which is terrible of course.",

This is mostly due to people getting busy with other projects and IRL stuff.\n\nWe do plan to pick this back up eventually, but it might take a while. Sorry about that.\n\nIf you want to see more of these types of shows, you can check out [Time Hotel](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/12mw631/the_time_hotel_s01e014_eng_sub/) (7 episodes out) and [Game of Blood 2](https://www.kocowa.com/en_us/season/76813109/bloody-game-2) (starts airing Friday). Both of which have official subs available.",

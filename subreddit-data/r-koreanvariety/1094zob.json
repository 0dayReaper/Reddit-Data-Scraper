    "postText": "I want to subscribe to Kocowa so I can watch Girl's Re:Verse. I'm sure that once I'm there I'll find other things I want to watch, but right now it's mainly just for that show. I read in the comments to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/xsrov2/kocowa_vs_viki_subscription/) that it's better to subscribe to Kocowa directly through the website than through Amazon Prime because there's less content available through Amazon, so I'm clear on that. The question I have is: Is there a difference in content available between subscribing to Kocowa directly vs getting access to Kocowa by upgrading my Viki Pass to a Viki Pass Plus?",

Plus Kocowa usually has most of their dramas already subbed when they air episodes EXCEPT some variety shows like I Am Solo might air raw before it is subbed \n\nViki has volunteer subs so it may take longer for episodes to be subbed vs Kocowa",

However, you will need to know exactly what you're looking for because their discover functions on Kocowa are awful. If it wasn't updated within the last week or two, you're unlikely to find older unique content by browsing normally.",

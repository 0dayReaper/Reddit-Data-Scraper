And I'm really curious what is up with the text on the screen telling people what's going on when we already know what's happening? For example there will be someone sitting in their living room eating and then they smile and a text will appear on the screen that says \"she's smiling\". Or when someone is pointing at something or someone the text will say \"he's pointing at his son\". Among many other things like that.\n\nIt's really weird and it makes me want to shout \"yes! We know what's going on, we can CLEARLY SEE what's happening! You don't need to tell us what we already know!\" Why do k shows do this?",

            "comment": "It goes back to the origin of variety shows, which were first popularized from Japan. All the things that make variety \"variety\" like unique subtitles, play backs of certain scenes, small screens with people's reactions, overreacting, all of it has history involved. The subtitles and cuts are just a way to kinda emphasize \"this is important!\" and in certain situations, are able to add some more humor. If you think this is bad, just watch some J variety, it feels like an Indian serial lol. \n\nI know for a lot of people, those are the main reasons that they can't get into traditional k variety (i.e not on Netflix) or gag comedy, but I personally love it. Maybe it's because I have a Korean sense of humor (dad jokes, wordplays, physical gag comedy) but it's a lot more appealing to me than Western humor.\n\nMy personal theory is that it helps with comprehension. Especially for some of the older OG shows like X-man, IC, and 2D1N, you needed at least some explanation for the rules of games or the challenges they were doing, especially if they were wordplay based, so that tradition just kinda spread across variety shows, even if they're not always needed.",

After years of enjoying K-variety I watched Run For The Money on Netflix\u2026 Egads, if this is Japanese style they love to hit you over the head with the same basic, obvious information every 5 minutes. At least as described above, K-variety limits captions to highlighted scenes and information and replays basically what you yourself would replay a few times on a YouTube clip. \n\nNow obviously if you\u2019re coming from western reality shows, even the Korean variety style will rankle a bit because the west uses scene descriptions and instant replay for very different things. But boy, Japan dumbs it down to a whole new basement sublevel.",

            "comment": "I agree the variety show aesthetic of including captions/subtitles probably came from Japan. One of the things that Japan and Korea share are regional dialects. Traditionally most comedians came from the Kansai region in Japan and subtitles were likely originally added to make sure that people who didn\u2019t speak that dialect didn\u2019t miss the punchline of the jokes. Over time the style just stuck. \n\nI also wonder if these days the content of the captions have shifted to be more explanatory given the aging population in both countries. If you\u2019ve ever watched a show with a parent or grandparent you know how hard for them to follow fast paced shows. Sometimes the captions can be a lot and don\u2019t necessarily add anything but i gotten so used to them at this point it\u2019s easy to ignore (like the laugh tracks they used to add to sitcoms back in the day).",

Translation, extra context, explaination to rules, text message n etc.\n\nBecause it's permeate throughout whole k-ent variety including YouTube, idol variety n etc. Even on Netflix i think, for me maybe i just got used to the approach.\n\nFor me International fans could like those stylistic approach more if it's in English, sometimes more detailed subbing community(example that i can think of old Running man translation n SNSD fan translation) translate those \"text on the screen\" to English. N yes it provides more additional context to the show.\n\nEdit: i just get used to it soo much i don't realise that almost all show i watch are doing it. Even Youngji, heechul youtube show are doing it. Eventho it's close to interview concept. And dare i say i quite prefer it nowadays",

I have only seen a few Korean variety shows (but watch all episodes consistently) and I like them for a few reasons:\n\n- Emphasize the action in the scene - adds comedy/ drama\n\n\n- When the editor comments are gentle teasing of the cast members on screen - I find this very funny and similar to when they do flashbacks (e.g. on RM, when the cast says they're good at drawing games but they're terrible or on ILA, when they do comparisons of the featured celebrities to a fixed cast member)\n\n\n- When the situation needs a translation note (e.g. on RM, whenever they play yut or switch from formal to informal address or vice versa). I see these translation notes very rarely on the Netflix shows (both variety and kdrama) and now that I have learned some of the cultural references thanks to translations on VIKI, I feel like I'm missing out without them.\n\nETA: spelling",

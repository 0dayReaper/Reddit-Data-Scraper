Things like meth heads, how meth is destroying so many rural communities, the ruined faces of people on meth.....\n\nIn Korea, since all drugs are treated as very bad, meth is just one of them and interestingly enough some people may not be afraid of them as Americans are.\n\nStill extremely shocking. SMJ is like one of the last contestants I would expect to do meth. Highly educated, seemingly high character, works for a huge company, etc.",

I'm also wondering if meth found in Korea is the same as meth in the US. I've heard that weed over there sucks and is extremely weak compared to the west, so I wonder if it's the same for other drugs. I haven't seen super recent photos of them, but they don't have the classic meth look.",

In this season, including various survival program winners, the top 1% of Mensa members with an IQ of 156, graduates from prestigious universities, someone who got a perfect score on the college entrance exams, and a legendary basketball player, people who are smart and have good physiques from various fields gather and compete for survival. The tension of survival builds up as the players become more vigorous while they try to figure out what others are thinking and their weaknesses. Who will be the winner of this bloody competition?\n\n# Cast\n\n* Dex (Former UDT, Member of S1)\n* Fujii Mina (Actress)\n* Ha Seungjin (Former Pro Basketballer)\n* Hong Jinho (Former Pro Gamer, Poker Player, Winner of 'The Genius')\n* Hyun Sungjoo (Poker Player)\n* Kerrigan May (Rapper)\n* Knucks (Dancer)\n* Lee Jinhyeong (University Student, Scored 100% In The 2019 College Entrance Exams)\n* Park Jimin (Announcer, Member of S1)\n* Pi (Streamer, Participated in 'Money Game')\n* Shin Hyunji (Model)\n* Xitsuh (aka. Seo Chulgoo, Rapper)\n* YunB (Rapper, Winner of 'Survival Men and Women')\n* Yurisa (Model, 156 IQ, Mensa Member)\n\n# Notes\n\nSo it looks like there's technically one more episode after this, but it's going to be a compilation of unreleased footage (a lot of which was seemingly posted on YouTube over the past few weeks, but it looks like there's a few new scenes). So that's why I've tagged this episode as the finale, and I'll tag the next one as maybe a bonus episode.",

But literally everything dropped a cliff since halfway. They completely ran out of ideas. And this final episode even counter the excuse that games are repetitive only because of Jinho's injury. It's beyond disappointing that they even repeat the games in the most important time of the season\n\nWell deserved for the winner. He acted and played poorly at times but he really demolished everyone in death matches.&gt;! Xitsuh's !&lt;death match performance was so underwhelming. He didn't play with any strategy and thought at all",

If we also include Time Hotel, it\u2019s 2 good months of \u201cThe Genius\u201d type of show we have always missed and of course the return of the GOAT Jinho is the cherry on top. Hope we can have more show like this agaim whether it\u2019s Bloody Game 3, Time Hotel 2 or new shows.\n\nNow to this final episode:\n\nSo we have 2 episodes that consist of 1 single game but have 4 games including in the semifinal and final in 1 episode? This is bullsh*t!!! And what\u2019s the point of calling it Final when final 4 still need to compete for the spot in final game? Doesn\u2019t it make more sense for it to be Seminal with Final 4 instead of Final 5 game?\n\nThe game in final is repetitive of Death match which isn\u2019t good. Come on, it\u2019s final!!! We need something more than Color turn and Jungle Maze. The memory one is alright though.\n\nProps to Jinhyung for his final win though. Even though I don\u2019t like his attitude that much during the entire show, I must admit he is pretty skillful in 1 Vs 1 game. It\u2019s a shame we don\u2019t see him competing with Jinho for the final. I hope he will get some confidence from this show to boost his confidence in real life after a struggle he talked about.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that Jinho misunderstood the rule and make a big mistake in the end. But that\u2019s the most \u201cJinho\u201d mistake that only Jinho can make though hahaha. Anyway, I like his gameplay in Semifinal and his call on Dex to go all-in. As someone mentioned before, it\u2019s similar to Dongmin-Yeonjoo situation in TG3. \n\nSad that we don\u2019t see a dream Xitsuh-Jinho final. It\u2019s a shame his memory isn\u2019t his biggest strength and his mental checked out entirely after failed Double in round 2 which shut down all the possibility of a comeback. Anyway, he gained a big respect for his gameplay and his loyalty in the entire show. I might not like his attitude in Ep.1 but looking back it\u2019s actually HSJ\u2019s original idea to divide it by gender and Xitsuh was the one who said it to girls\u2026not in the very nicest way though.\n\nI see people undermined Dex-Hyunji gameplay but I think they contributed to the alliance in some ways. Just because they took a backseat for Jinho-Xitsuh to take control doesn\u2019t mean they are entirely useless. They may not be the brightest crayons in the box but they aren\u2019t that dumb or useless as someone deemed them to be either.\n\nNew players I hope we could see in the future again are Yurisa, Xitsuh and probably Sungjoo, Knucks and Mina. I don\u2019t mind seeing Hyunji, Jinhyung, YunB and Pi if they want to bring them back. But \u2014redacted\u2014 should be retire and never appear in any shows like this again. His presence alone just make this show 50% more unwatchable and Ep.9-10 are probably one of the most frustrating hours in my entire experience of watching Korean shows.\n\nFinally, can we have Dongmin and Jinho back for Season 3 please?",

                            "comment": "I feel for Xitsuh. Board games and maths games are one thing but visual memorisation.. either you can do it or you can't. If you are straight up bad at it it's not like you can come up with a strategy mid game\n\nThere are some people who are way less cunning, way less good at the social game, way less good at strategy and maths, but if you just gave them that board they would remember the entire thing in 20 seconds burned on their retina. There's no winning in that kind of game if you just happen to be worse. they are the most brutal of the games in that respect\n\njh to be fair, did have a good strategy in that he simply remembered 6 positions in chronological order, that way you don't have to remember pairs but remember singles. I guess the counter to that after round 1 is to learn positions 1 3 5 if you're due to go first or 2 4 6 if you're due to go second so you can cockblock half of his sure picks, then memorise the 3 from the backend. then round 3 you learn 456 and the three from the bottom left\n\nI have aphantasia so the way I tried to do it when I was playing along is pick a fixed straight line from left to right, then assign the corresponding symbol to each symbol a grid base number (so 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 up to 6-6), then I already have a number memorisation system where 1 = L, 2 = N, 3 = T, 4 = F/V, 5 = S, 6 = G\n\nso e.g. say the 4th line matched up with 1-4 2-5 3-2 1-2 6-3 3-4\n\nyou insert vowels so that would become \"life ness tan line get tuff\". and that's way easier to remember than 12 coordinates, you can just repeat it out loud and the opponent won't even know what you're on about. then simply go across your line and so it's line 4, the first one will be LiFe, 1-4. the next one will be ness 2-5. and so on\n\nbut in reality, in 10/20 seconds, even just FINDING the corresponding match to your line, then assigning it a grid coordinate, then assigning that a word, while remembering all previous words. it's too much. if you gave me 10 minutes and a piece of paper I could come up with a string of words to remember the whole grid, but 10 seconds.. at that point you may as well just go for the symbols that stand out to you that you can remember\n\nor you can try and hit random symbols that you think are more likely to hit the important words and win like that given you know the answers must be mega simple for the rounds to end. so focus on remembering only 3 pairs or so that you think will be in positions the key words are likely to come up in like the final couple syllables, and then rely on guessing the correct answer\n\nobviously xitsuh really did fuck up the first two guesses and also throwing away his bonus was hella dumb. especially as once he knew jh's strategy he could use his double on the first 2 symbols depriving him of 2 of his certain guesses. but ultimately, again, it is virtually impossible to come up with a clever strategy. you can on paper come up with an idea that's way better than your opponent's but.. if you are shit at visual memorisation and your opponent has a photographic memory, you're pretty much just fucked no matter who has a better strategy",

The show relies hard on politicking and hidden gimmicks; it becomes a normal game survival show when all 'dirty' players are eliminated. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!At the very least, the show has better dirty players in YunB and HSJ. The storyline is way better than the previous season. The gimmicks are cool (even thought it dried up before the semifinal). Seeing Hong Jinho not becoming an annoying Kkondae is also a relief for me; he even counsels other players lmao.!&lt;\n\nAnyway, this show is a good warmup before The Devil's Plan. I know JJY God won't let me down.",

            "comment": "- This season was definitely better than S1 overall except for the finals. That tournament style game was boring as fuck and they even recycled 2 of the 3 games. Finals of S1 was a lot better, or at the very least they should have at least made the games in the finals unique.\n\n- They introduced a lot of the twists in this season which was good at the start but they underutilized them and I think that was wasted potential. The wild team and mansion team only fought 2 matches, the dungeon players only fought 3 matches, they could have utilized just one of that mechanic and made it last longer and it would still have been good.\n\n- Personality aside I will never respect Jinhyeong as a person but I can respect his plays and I already had this feeling when I learned that the finals was a 1v1 tournament that he would roll everyone except Jinho because he is the best 1v1 player in there. Unfortunately Jinho blundered so bad it made his time hotel blunders look good. That semi final match still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. Common dude, you started with black pieces, opponent is playing white pieces.... \n\n- Here's my personal overall ranking after the show\n\n1. Jinho, Jinhyeong\n\n2. Xitsuh\n\n3. Dex, Yunbi, Knucks\n\n4. Yurisa, Sungjoo, Mina, Hyunji\n\n5. Pi\n\n6. Jimin\n\n7. Seungjin",

Or I'm thinking it might it's the bad luck that has come to get him after giving him &gt;!two chances in The Time Hotel !&lt;LMAO. Hopefully we can see him again in a year or two but he did say he have poker tournaments lined up for the next year.\n\nDex has been a favorite since S1 and I was actually disappointed in his &gt;!sacrifice!&lt; last season. Really enjoyed his chill attitude and levelheaded game play. He is on the rise so I'm sure we'll see more of him, and he'll be with Kian on Adventure by Accident S2!\n\nMy favorite discovery is honestly Xitsuh and I'll miss this spitfire the most. I've already finished SMTM5 for him (and I don't even enjoy Hiphop/Rap) but he's so annoyingly funny and temperamental that makes for great TV persona. But I like that he does good deeds subtly like how he defended Pi against Yunbi's gaslighting or that cipher mission. I wish I could see him in more talk shows/variety.\n\nEdit:\n\n[Xitsuh went on a YT live today and answered some questions re: BG2. These are some that I understood](https://www.youtube.com/live/EPe3TQG2N5Y?feature=share) (please correct me if I'm wrong):\n\n* Somebody asked him why he played so badly in the Finals. He said \"So what? (\uc5b4\uca4c\ub77c\uace0)\" lmao but he eventually said sorry and it is what it is.\n* He's learning poker these days and has much respect for Jinho and Seungjoo because it requires great skill\n* Music wise, he'll be on [Dingo Killing Verse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46cCVcqRwFg) ~~soon~~. He also said he's working on his album but no release date yet.\n* Their chat room is still active. Another question he said the cast meet up as often as they could and brought up the fact that he went [karaoke with Dex and Hyunji](https://youtu.be/kRJcgD6wdoQ) on live last time.\n* Somebody asked about love line and he answered it's him and Jinho LMAO He said he can't see anyone else, something about his heart rate, and feeling sad? if he can't see him. (Guy is a clown I love it)\n* Another question about him playing badly today LOL\n* His next plan is to improve his physical. He noticed he severely lacked in that department. He later on says that he will be a player in charge of physical aspect in the next survival show he joins.\n* Those who stayed at the hotel after getting eliminated had great food and he's complaining that he didn't even get to try it\n* He did an encore of his \"hanbonman\" scene begging Yurisa for the last time slot so they could win. He said he did the best he can for them to win.\n* Asked if he would betray if he wasn't in the Jungle team. He said he definitely will do whatever it takes to get far in the game.\n* He said his play style matched well with Jinho in that they're both very open and honest with each other. He also said he strategized a lot and always ran his thoughts with Jinho to confirm.\n* \"You played disappointingly\" \"I'm sorry\"\n* \"Xitsuh-Lee Jinho would have been amazing in the finals\" he said which program has Lee Jinho LOL\n* There's a bathroom in the Jungle location but they can't shower (?)\n* Asked about ghost in the Jungle, he said they were too tired to get scared\n* He admitted he made a lot of mistakes in the latter episodes esp in ep 9-10\n* Who's more handsome between Dex and One? It depends on their condition for that day \n* [What did he and Jinho talk about when they met after losing in the semifinals?](https://www.youtube.com/live/EPe3TQG2N5Y?feature=share&amp;t=3165) \\- XS said 'hyung I'm in the Kong-line but how is it that we both failed like this?' Jinho said 'you're not Kong-line. At least I failed in the finals. You didn't even make it to the finals so you're excluded from the Kong-line' (Not really sure about this one)\n* Another comment about playing poorly (he'll never live this down lol)",

Oh I have a great plan for round 2, I will just develop an eidetic memory like my opponent within the next 10 seconds\". what on earth do they want him to do, apologise for being born without that skill?\n\nhe played great in round 1, determining the expectations and tracking the scores so he knew he would definitey buy his numbers at minimal extra cost. Look at the prices he got them for, he bought his numbers at relative profit. he just lost out because his strategy of low early bids allowed DEX to get numbers at about their fair cost because the others were bowing out early too despite half of them not having a serious strategy\n\nas soon as jinho picked him for a game he is functionally incapable of, he was just fucked, there was no amount of preparation of strategisation that could've helped him. I can understand being disappointed in jinho not understanding the rules, but people are being stupidly harsh on xitsuh",

The one I see people being harsh to is Dex, he's constantly and comfortably being downplayed and discredited even tho he actually has results.

Two of the games were direct repeats and the one that Xitsuh and Jinhyeong played was a derivative of the memory game from The Genius which, to me, was the most boring death match out of all.\n\n* I\u2019m a little bit surprised that they didn\u2019t have any physical games at any point after Arithmetic Road - I\u2019m guessing they had to change up a lot of the games after Jinho got injured to make the games more fair\n\n* I\u2019m annoyed that Jinhyeong won. Sure he had the skills to win but that doesn\u2019t make it fun that such a (in my view, and I\u2019m sure there is plenty of disagreement from posters here) selfish and sociopathic player (not saying he is sociopathic in real life but that he played the games and alliances in a sociopathic way) won.\n\n* It\u2019s poetic and a bit ironically funny that Jinho won the Semis knowing the rules in a very detailed way but then losing in the first finals round because he didn\u2019t read the rules detailed enough.",

The disappointment I felt with the games more than the game plays... Lol (and I am disappointed with the plays/players)\u00a0\n\n\nPD still has a lot to learn to do this type of show better. Even after 9 or 10 years, to me, nothing beats The Genius still. Even Society Game are better as they succeed at incorporating physical and mental aspect in one game.\u00a0\n\n\nThe only way to compensate the disappointing games is a spin-off variety show for the casts (heh, obviously a personal wish)\u00a0\n\n\nI hope they show us the rules that Jinho read. Was it a silly mistake or the wordings was actually written in a way that can easily be misunderstood?",

I know they've outsourced a lot of the actual game *design* to professionals, but ultimately it looks like the types of games they requested ended up making the whole middle stretch feel super repetitive since almost every game was just \"make an alliance, predict what your opponents will do\" and Jinho was able to do what he could to make those games interesting.\n\nI will say, shoutout to Arithmetic Road, Black And White, and all the DMs (aside from the Ascending Order game), those were pretty sickass games.",

Now, okay, it is somewhat her fault that she ended up in the dm with yurisa. But it was also a horrendously unlucky turn of fate that JH happened to INSTANTLY betray her confidence and bring all the dudes into the pandora room and not notice yurisa's trap at all, and then jimin happened to enter the room RIGHT after that. it is extraordinarily difficult to come back from that level of distrust. and when the guys decided to target yurisa, that was it. I think she could've gone a lot further\n\npi was F, the only player to be double eliminated\n\nI would move hyunji and knucks down because they really didn't do much except get eliminated. knucks fell for some really dumb shit in the invasion. he was a good leader and respectable but he also made critical failures like instantly picking jinho for the DM, and we didn't see much actual good from him other than card hunting and being liked within the house. hyunji likewise is really only there by chance because dex was a human shield for her and she got taken along for the ride\n\nI would move yunb and yurisa up to B tier and sungjoo and Mina up to C tier. Sungjoo okay lost a deathmatch to yurisa but when he came back as a phantom he had his shoelaces strategy. clearly the guy is clever, adaptable, a strong player, he just went out really early. we could've seen a lot more from him. Mina struggled due to her temperament and the language barrier (and it seemed like there was some xenophobia going on there too, I can't blame her feeling singled out), but she was a DM killer so she deserves a better spot. And likewise.. yurisa is way too aloof and not good at the social game but she's another DM killer and if the game wasn't so cliquey she had a chance to go far\n\nor imagine an alternative reality where jungle team took say JH and SJ (trying to get a maths type person and a strength player and hoping the house would turn against jinho on its own). in that world it might not have become a men vs women thing instantly because SJ said that, and jinho may have teamed up with Yurisa. maybe jh would pushily try to be a spy because he thinks jimin would be singled out too first as a non fresh face. It's fascinating to think actually how different every hypothetical season would've been with the 65 other possible permutations of initial jungle candidates\n\nI would also move sj up to E tier, because he actually showed some promise in that death game against dex, and he was the only one in the raid actually doing his job even if he did go mental afterwards",

If anything she was lucky that Yurisa was around to look even more suspicious than her. If Yurisa was gone (and Kerrigan May wasn't removed), Jimin would've almost definitely been ganged up on as the obvious spy after players starting getting abducted. And I don't think she would've gone further, she brings literally nothing to the jungle team aside from potentially betraying them, which would result in her getting in a DM which she'd almost definitely lose.\n\nI have no clue how you would simultaneously want to rate Jimin higher but also bring other people down for being too social and not demonstrating good capability in games (Hyunji and Knucks), like on what grounds could Hyunji possibly have worse odds of winning than Jimin?\n\n(Edit: Actually I guess you don't mean that Jimin should be higher, but it still feels like a contradictory set of evaluations of the different players, since I don't see any reason to give Jimin bonus points that I wouldn't also give loads of other players)",

I agree with you though in general that she lost through preventable measures because she was trying to play the metagame too much instead of blending in. I think her biggest mistake was trying to go spy, she had a huge target on her back. They should've sent hyunji as the only fresh face and as a quiet person who probably wasn't going to attract any ire the first couple of weeks\n\nPi deserves rock bottom tier, because she played like absolute ass. People kept her around as a buffer like \"well if I have pi with me then people will take her to the deathmatch rather than me because she's weaker\". All she ever did is did as she was told, she played 2 deathmatches and lost 2 deathmatches. And the only time she decided to make her own mind up and actually do something, she lost a game she was basically guaranteed to come first in. really terrible player, no one belongs in that tier with her, not even jimin or sj\n\nKnucks had good physical and he had good friendliness. I don't think that's necessarily the same thing as good social. I think good social requires some level of being able to roll with the punches, switch teams up without pissing people off, work to your own advantage without upsetting people. He is the classic \"loyal friend\" archetype which gets midway through this game but can't get much further. and even for ones with poor social game, I could see yurisa theoretically surviving through as an outcast but I don't think knucks could survive alone, I don't think he could survive in a betraying atmosphere and I don't think he could survive the death games. so I don't think there's any scenario even with luck where he could advance\n\nhyunji in that respect has a better chance to go further than knucks (but never to the end) because she's like Pi, she's a \"blend in\" person, and blend in people get to go along for the ride further than proactive people. knucks had a better chance of actually making a big play like eliminating someone, but she had no shot at winning whatsoever, she is only marginally above pi in skill. I don't agree that she even had good social game, I don't really see what she did that was impressive ever. I can't list 1 single thing she achieved that wasn't just \"I teamed up with someone who helped me win\"\n\nI think hyunji's odds of winning are exactly the same as jimin's: 0. I don't think either of them are capable of winning a single round when it's down to 5 people and individual games. but I also didn't ever see hyunji ever do anything at all so it's hard for me to credit her with anything whatsoever, at least jimin had plans like changing the note on pandora's box. picking jinho and xitsuh for the jungle team as well, especially when xitsuh was never the original plan, shows a level of strategy that hyunji never showed. she got away with a bunch of theft\n\nhyunji literally just like.. betrayed her own team in a way that was too incompetent to even change any results. her betrayal was so ineffectual that no one even noticed they were betrayed. like honestly, really, what did hyunji ever do? got to the top 5 and did literally nothing ever. she is on par with Layone",

Similarly, Seungjin's trolling strategy was self-destructive, but that was kind of his intention, and he had some decent enough spy performances, so those two at least had some glimmers of forethought/game skill.\n\nI can see what you mean by Knucks having a rigid social game, but I think his collaboration with the Jungle Team in E7 and with Jinho in E12 prove that he's more versatile than you think. For Hyunji, I guess that's pretty up for speculation but my impression of her contributions throughout the show was that she was much more promising than Pi or Jimin in terms of game and meta strategy (ie. recognising that she had to try and go for Jinho/Xitsuh, even if it didn't end up working out, but she was going up against Jinho and Xitsuh, so I don't hold that against her that much).",

He realised, \"okay memory is not my forte\" and he came up with a technique to destroy his weakness. He knew there was no way he could remember all those numbers so he made a system to remember. To me, that shows a higher level of play than many other players, especially given that he did it when there were no stakes for him anymore\n\nThe fact that he went home, and thought \"ugh if only I had done xyz\". Some people would lose, go home and be like \"oh well I lost\", he instead, even as an ELIMINATED CANDIDATE, went home and figured out how he could win a game that in all likelihood he would never have to play again in his life, but he still wanted to patch up his weaknesses\n\nI know in these games you can argue that if you have a weakness in a deathgame you don't get a second chance. But that's not always true, some are based on multiple rounds. And if your weakness was a main match and you avoid going to the deathmatch, you can come back and play the other main matches better. I see a lot in him that we didn't get to explore because he was very early pitted against a candidate in a game where he had a natural weakness",

His win in the semifinal was also very much like him. Even if Jang Dongmin had been better than him in several occasions. I\u2019ve always liked him better cos he ALWAYS makes for dramatic wins and loses lol.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention Chulgu! I find his loss much more sad than Jinho/Dex/Hyunji since he really, only he got battered this finals. And the way that he was the only one caring about the wild team until the end was so endearing.",

Most importantly he doesn\u2019t trumpet his contributions and sacrifices and expect anything in return (e.g. giving his sneakers to Xitsuh in the jungle and thus have to climb that tall tree to retrieve papayas in his slippers which is dangerous af, volunteering to go to DM on behalf of Hyunji as he felt bad for selecting her to the jungle).

But even more dissapointing was manner of how everything ended.\n\nWe saw 12 episodes of them trying to do big brain plays trying to ouplay each other and the final episode is series of blunders. They showed that Xitsuh couldn't sleep night before, but it looked like everybody had similar problem.\n\n1. Dex missing a win in semifinal because he forgot that you can't have least amount of blocks. (wtf moment, but it didn't really matter that much)\n2. Jinho \"giving up\" because he didn't understand that he has his own color?\n3. Xitsuh not being able to remember one pair at the start of the match.\n4. And finals, Jinhyeong  almost losing, because for some reason he decided to go around longer way instead of following Dex as they had same goal. He was ahead, he just had to wait for Dex to reach it first and follow him, while trying to prepare field for next goal. He had only one left he knew where he will need to go. It was as close as it was only for this reason.\n\nTop 2 was kinda deserved as deathmatch games were most important in the show. Money games didn't really matter as long as person could win 1on1 deathmatch. And (although not everybody had same chance to do deathmatches), imo Jinhyeong and Dex played them on average best from all the players.\n\nLots of people hate on Jinhyeong because of his playstyle. Although he was not my favorite, and was weak in psychological side of games, I think lot of people are overreacting. This is survival game. It's not real life. And while some people played \"fair\", this is individual contest.  I get that most people here are celebrities interested in advertising their brand and don't care about prize money that much, but I was getting annoyed few times in S1 when they were literally racing who will sacrifice himself for others. So I didn't really mind Jinhyeong backstabbing everybody, even though he wasn't really doing it in a way where he would be my favorite. Only thing that really made me annoyed was when he kept approaching Mina telling her that he voted for her. Once was enough.",

The show peaked in Ep 6 and never got interesting since.\n\nHyunji - &gt;!Semis: Combination of both bad luck and poor strategy. I don't think she realized how severe the -5 Bad Card is. Also shows the discrepancy in her skills compared to everyone else. - Grand Finals: Strange that she suddenly disappeared. Did she decide to fly out after she lost? Mina's absence is also noteworthy. Explains why Yurisa showed up with Knucks instead of her in Ep12.!&lt;\n\nXitsuh - &gt;!Semis: Played the best out of all players, but got unlucky due to the order of cards. He won a good number of cards for an absolute steal. - Finals: I don't know if it was his sleep deprivation and/or his terrible memory, but he was absolutely spanked in this game. !&lt;\n\nJinho - &gt;!Semis: His 1st bid was really dumb. His bid to block Jinhyeong from winning was also unwise. Manages to recover by knowing Dex's playstyle and banking on him making a mistake. - Finals: Loses in the most Jinho way possible (FYI in his pro-gaming career, Jinho would make it to the finals, but then crack under pressure and lose in a very humiliating fashion). Makes up for his most embarrassing moments in Time Hotel (his behavior in the On/Off game was particularly facepalm worthy).!&lt;\n\nDex - &gt;!Semis: Can't fault his straight-forward strategy bidding on high value cards. Got lucky being on the 4th position and good card order. Should have won, except he made a bone-headed mistake, but then I guess karma is a bitch because Jinho makes a mistake later... - Finals: Claims he \"beat\" Jinho. Not sure if it's a translation error, but pretty sure Jinho beat himself. - Grand Finals: He played well to the extent of his abilities but he was outmatched. He didn't lose as badly as Xitsuh did, but he made too many mistakes and couldn't catch up.!&lt;\n\nJinhyeong -  &gt;!Semis: Lucked out getting the 5th spot and had great card order. Really brutal move by deliberately bidding high to eliminate Hyunji. Jinhyeong was out for blood that day. - Finals:  This game seems designed for Jinhyeong, whose strength is literally preparing for an exam that requires memorization. - Grand Finals: Well played. No really flaw in his play other than his odd decision not to follow Dex's piece after capturing the 2nd point.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!As much as I dislike Jinhyeong, he absolutely deserved to win. He played the best out of everyone that day and he would have beaten anyone 1v1, even against Jinho. Jinhyeong is the only \"normal\" contestant out of the entire cast. He is not a pro-poker player, ex-athlete, model or an influencer, so money probably doesn't come easy to him. It's not unlike the winner of S1 who was a police officer, but at least that guy (forgot his name) was more likeable than Jinhyeong.!&lt;\n\nI would watch a S3 of Bloody Game... but I have a laundry list of complaints.\n\n* Need to have different games and no/less repeats\n* More physical games next time regardless of player injury, could be like Ep6 where teammates can have different roles. Society Game S1 and S2 did this perfectly.\n* The outside mansion game concept needs to be reworked. I'm not a PD, but I think it is a terrible waste to have such elaborate work done on the hidden rooms and pathways in the mansion, only to abandon them after Ep5. Also what's up with the Phantom Casino? They only showed it once in Ep2 and then it was cut out for the rest of the season.\n* Better safety standards. The mansion invasion was a terrible concept and the showrunners are lucky they aren't being sued.  Jinho's injury was completely avoidable. Pi trying to knee Hyunji was uncalled for and she could have sustained a career ending injury. Mina holding a 2x4 was just plain dangerous. And we can't forget Seungjin's fight with Dex which should have been broken up immediately, but they decided to keep filming anyway.",

I don't know if anyone can label him dumb again after this, he proves that he's capable it's just that he's more laid back in speech, manner and how he strategizes, but he never makes dumb mistakes, he can see his opponent's moves and block it effectively a few times although his opponent is on a much higher brain capability and he makes quite a tough opponent too not the \"easy opponent\" and gives easy win to his opponent like how everyone seems to think he will. He can even win overwhelmingly in the semi, if only he didn't miss out on that one rule. Ironically Jinho winning semi is the cause for him to lose in the final.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!He plays well in the final too, have you ever heard Jinyoung say that 'you play well' a few times while he's in a match with someone? I think one of Jinyoung's biggest merits while playing is his ability to not be arrogant and underestimating his opponent while playing, hence he is cool headed, alert and focused throughout playing and in whatever game it is. Good game to him. I like that Pi calls Dex captain while they're playing together too, these all show some level of their acknowledgement to Dex to me!&lt;\n\n&gt;!People might try to discredit Dex's win whether during the DMs or in the final, or JY's praise for him, but whatever, fact is he has won by himself and his own capability more times that your more \"capable\" players in a match. I'm not here to convince others anyway, I'm here to watch him play and it was a good game and a good play.!&lt;",

For me, Jin Hyeong present this show title \"Blood of Game\" very2 well compared with Dex, Jinho and Xitshuh. They're too loyal from begining until to the end. Even people hate Jin Hyeong attitude also always discredit Dex, i'm proud and happy they face 1 v 1. In a reality show, anything can happen.",

On the other hand, I was quite happy to see Jinhyeong win since him, Jinho, and Xitsuh seemed like the only 3 people who were really able to understand the game mechanics throughout the season and tried the hardest to increase their win equity outside of the specific games as well. !&lt;\n\nAs a side, &gt;!Dex seems to have improved since S1 which is nice, but I'm still hesitant to buy the idea that he's actually a big mental threat yet, since most of his wins are a little hard to be impressed by (beating Mina who was just botching answers left and right, beating Seungjin, Jinho beating himself). And it felt like even if Dex had good ideas and focus in the final game, I doubt his strategies were as \"sophisticated\" as the edit was making it seem. It always feels like a red flag when the voiceover or opponent is having to explain why Dex's strategy was working instead of just using a confessional of him to explain what moves he'd predicted, his final strategy to turn the tables, etc. if he had actually thought that deeply about his moves. Would be interested to see him play in another game to better see how much he's improved, since it feels like he didn't get to show too much in this season.!&lt;",

Just because one doesn\u2019t explain his thought process or strategy well enough in his confessional, doesn\u2019t mean you can discredit his gameplay and ability. Even his opponent who is playing the game with him acknowledges him, so why are you as a viewer on the sideline still doubting his ability? Seems unfair and bias to me.",

            "comment": "Semi-finals auction game was pretty fun, however luck played a bit too much role and the player who played the most conservatively &gt;!Xitsuh!&lt; couldn't win simply because of luck of the draw. While &gt;!Jinhyeong!&lt; and &gt;!Hyunji!&lt; spent all their blocks to obliterate each other it ended up a game between &gt;!Jinho!&lt; and &gt;!Dex!&lt;.\n\nFinale games were defined not winners doing amazingly but by losing side doing mistakes which feels unsatisfying for the viewer. However the eventual winner feels 100% deserved, despite all the negative edit throughout the season. I must wonder if maybe the producers should have softened his edit and made him a bit more heroic to make the the entire arc more satisfying. Overall this run is kinda similar to Titty God's run in Grand Finale of The Genius but that arc was edited so much better and &gt;!Jinhyeong!&lt; simply isn't as fun of a personality so probably editors didn't had enough material to make it more compelling.",

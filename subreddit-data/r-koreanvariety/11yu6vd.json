highlights.**\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~0' WW Miss: **WW 02** takes game starting centerline kick-in with a shot on target that bounces in front of the goal mouth which **NF 9 (GK)** smothers easily!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~1' WW Miss: **WW 23** takes a corner kick-in with a pass to the top of the 16 yard box, with **WW 02** setting a pick for **WW 29** to get a shot off, the play goes without a hitch and **WW 29** gets a shot on goal but it hits **NF 17** and re-directs to the goal mouth that **NF 9 (GK)** mishandles and **WW 02** jumps to control but **NF 9 (GK)** manages to get her hand on the ball and **WW 02** falls on top of the ball as the whistle blows to call a stoppage in play for the safety of the players in the scrum!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~1' WW Miss: **NF 9 (GK)** takes the ensuing free kick with a horrible pass to the left wing side that **WW 02** intercepts and **WW 29** cuts to the opposite wing to receive a pass, **WW 02** kicks the perfect pass but a huge defensive stop by **NF 1** to kick the ball out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' WW Miss: Coach SeokJu calls for play number five, **WW 23** takes the corner kick-in and all the players run their routes, **WW 8** is open but the pass is sent long and to **WW 10 (GK)** who takes a shot but misses the target by a large margin!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' WW Miss: NF are having trouble getting the ball to an open player from their end with WW on full court pressure mode, **NF 9 (GK)** rolls a fast pass intencted for **NF 690** but it is intercepted bu **WW 02** and **NF 1** misses the defensive stop, **WW 02** gets a power shot on target but **NF 9 (GK)** comes up with a save and smother, NF needs to pass the ball out faster with WW  out of position or just kick the ball deep and work from there!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' NF Miss: **NF 690** strips the ball from **WW 02** and the ball is kicked forward deep into WW territory, it's a 50/50 ball between the speedy **NF 690** and **WW 10 (GK)**, **WW 10 (GK)** comes out and gets a slide tackle so that ball is deflected out of bounds before **NF 690** can get a shot on target!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' WW Foul: **NF 17** goes down from a long leg of **WW 31** that stuck out a bit too far, a yellow card is flashed by the ref, a free-kick is awarded near the centreline!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' WW Defensive stop: **NF 690** gets a loose ball misplayed from **WW 23**, and she dekes out **WW 23** and has the left wing side all to herself, **WW 02** comes up with a big defensive stop with some help defense by kicking the ball out of bounds to the sideline!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~4' NF Miss: **NF 1** takes a sideline kick-in from NF territory with a horrible pass forward right into **WW 02**'s feet, **WW 02** controls the ball and kicks a power cross pass that **WW 29** gets a volley re-direction on target that **NF 9 (GK)** gets a fantastic stop with her feet!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~5' WW Foul: **NF 690** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot on goal that **WW 31** blocks with her arm that was protecting her face, with her right elbow moving out a bit to block the ball, the ref blows the whistle and awards a penalty kick for NF!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' NF PK: **NF 17** is the shooter and **WW 10 (GK)** the goalie!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' NF Miss: **NF 17** takes a penalty kick with a power shot down the middle and a bit to the left, **WW 10 (GK)** gets a huge block and chases down the deflected ball to smother it!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' WW Foul: **NF 690** gets a breakaway chance and **WW 31** gets her leg in the way to trip her up, this is the RED card foul, where **SooGeun and SungJae** state that a red card would result in a 3 minute shorthanded play and the player isn't removed from the game but can play after the time elapses, a free kick is awarded and **NF 690** to shoot!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' NF Miss: **NF 690** takes the direct free kick with a shot on target that hits **WW 23** who was part of the defensive wall, the ball deflects to the right side of the WW net and **NF 17** gets a knee on it that brings the ball down and she attempts to take a poke shot but **WW 10 (GK)** comes up big with a smother of the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' NF Miss: **NF 17** with the highlight reel ball control deking out **WW 02**, in the end **WW 02** gets the ball kicked out deep in WW territory!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' NF Miss: **WW 8** kicks a weak cross pass in her defensive end that **NF 123** manages to intercept but shoots a terrible left-footed weak shot that **WW 10 (GK)** smothers!&lt;\n\nHALFTIME SCORE LINE: &gt;!------- NatFam 0 - 0 WonderWoman , time to take advantage of the red card foul elapsed, WW will be back to full strength, it is similar to how Ice Hockey penalties are awarded--------!&lt;\n \nHighlights:&gt;!~11' WW Miss: **WW 23** takes a sideline kick-in and passes to **WW 31** who takes a power shot that misses the target by a large margin!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' NF Miss: a little bit of zombie soccer with **NF 123** and **NF 17**, but the ball squirts out to **NF 690** who gets a shot on target that **WW 10 (GK)** bobbles but smothers!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' WW Miss: **WW 23** takes a corner kick-in and passes to **WW 31** who takes a power shot that misses the target to the left side by a few feet!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!13' WW GOAL: **WW 23** takes a corner kick-in and passes to **WW 29** whose redirected shot goes right back to **WW 23** in the corner, **WW 23** crosses it back to **WW 29** again but she misses her chance but the ball continues and **WW 31** steps into the ball for a shot on target aimed for the bottom right corner, **WW 31** first goal of her **Shooting Star**'s career, **NF 9 (GK)** dives for the ball but the shot was perfect, Variety moment **Kim SeolHee** is the reverse **Ha SeokJu** lol!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!13' WW GOAL: **NF 1** messes up her first touch and **WW 02** steals the ball from her, **WW 02** dribbles down the right wing side and takes a shot on target with **NF 1** in hot pursuit, the shot is placed to open left side of the net where **NF 9 (GK)** was out of position and couldn't recover, two goals scored by WW within 30 seconds, NF needs to keep their resolve this will be mentally defeating!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' WW Miss: **WW 23** takes a shot on target from the centerline that deflects off of **NF 1**, the ball then hits the right post and bounces back into play that **WW 02** tracks down and takes another shot on net but it is way off target, **Coach TaeYoung** calls a time-out to settle his team and give them a breather, **NF 1** is an emotional wreck and needs to be strong for her team!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' NF Miss: **NF 690** saves a ball from going out of bounds and dribbles forward to be blocked by **WW 8**, the ball re-directs to **NF 1** who shoots a long rolling pass/shot into WW territory which **NF 17** tries to track down, **WW 10 (GK)** comes out of her net and kicks the ball away before an offensive chance can be created!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' NF Foul: **NF 123** gets her foot in front of **WW 02** and **WW 02** falls for a foul.  **NF 690** is down as well with a pulled calf muscle, and **NF 11** is on the sidelines taking off her bracing boot and seeing if she can walk and play but only to cry knowing that she cannot help her teammates, **NF 690** gets up after a bit of medical treatment!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' WW Miss: **WW 23** takes a corner kick-in and passes to **WW 31** who takes a power shot that misses the target to the top right corner by a few feet!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' WW Foul: **WW 23** messes up her first touch on a bouncing clearing attempt from **NF 9 (GK)**, she swung her body and the ball grazed her arm for a Hand-ball foul for a free-kick at the centerline!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' NF position change: **NF 10 (GK)** is swapped for **NF 690**, so now **NF 10** and **NF 690 (GK)** are the positions, **NF 690 (GK)** has been still having issues with her pulled calf muscle and isn't running hard so **Coach TaeYoung** wants to generate some offense with **NF 10**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' WW Miss: **WW 02** gets a breakaway chance and takes a shot on target but **NF 690 (GK)** gets her right hand on the ball to deflect it out for a WW corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' WW Miss: **WW 23** takes the corner kick-in with a shot on target that **NF 690 (GK)** bobbles a bit but smothers!&lt;\n\n\nFINAL SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- NatFam 0 - **2 WonderWoman**  -- Sloppy game from NF but they have a few positives with their brand new players.  Didn't want to say it but MinJeong is really bad at her positioning, either running to a ball a teammate is running to or getting in a teammate's way, she really needs to learn positioning to be effective or possibly play goalkeeper to use SeoHyun as a field player, they were ineffective with getting open for passes and their passes were horrible too, a learning experience hopefully, and Hwang HeeJeong won't be any better, so they really need to skill up their team play, the mighty have fallen-------!&lt;\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!WorldClass vs. Giants, Kim JinKyung returns to the Giants, and looks like Jin JeongSun and Heo KyungHee are playing Goalie so the rumors of Irene leaving the Giants is true.  Another RED card issued in this game, again I hope it doesn't lead to an injury!&lt;",

                    "comment": "Tbh for &gt;!Nat Fam, they got hella potential new recruits- **it revamped their scoring capabilities thru Kim Min Ji and Na Mi Hae.**!&lt; however &gt;!their experience players it\u2019s either abysmal or injured so they got exposed so bad. Kwak Min Jeong is always colliding with her teammates or lost on position that always kills the midfield build up.!&lt; \n\n\nThat poor build up from &gt;!GK to fullback is recipe for disaster - GK is lost and fullback is alone **and can\u2019t even retained the ball** which is also contributed from 3-1 formation as they went on hyper offensive **which is exploited so bad** + MF and FW are abysmal. Everything went wrong on Nat Fam, even tho they have a capabilities to outmaneuver WW.!&lt; \n\n\n[Skills doesn\u2019t necessarily win games **but it will never ever out of equation to win games**. But this season, the show already evolved to battle of wits and tactics between coaches.]\n\n\n&gt;!In terms of height, WW is outmatch but on speed and urgency they bested NF. Not only that, they place set pieces that suit on players - as Kim Seol Hee has a good striking power, so they extend it from Ga Young to her, striker from outside.!&lt; When i said wits and tactics, &gt;!Nat Fam fullback is alone and slow and they used that either a long ball or press to open the deadlock that suit really well for Kim Ga Young and Hong Ja, as they\u2019re not shy of running on both ends of pitch. Great job for Kisum on GK\u2019ing as well, she said she really want to play the position at first place.!&lt;\n\n\nPlayer of the Game : &gt;!If you have a player that doesn\u2019t get tired on running either for defense and cutting the opposite passes/pressing to score like **Kim Ga Young**, the only thing you worried is someone like Modric/Iniesta type needs to telegraph the ball to her so she can run it.!&lt;",

Kim Min Ji for me has potential, not so sure about Na Mi Hae she is very slow and the only thing she can do is dribble which doesn't go anywhere and pass backwords. NatFam right now is by far the weakest team out of all 10 teams CL and SL. Only hope I see for NatFam is Hee Jeong think putting her in the back line may free up Min Ji more.",

That\u2019s why Kim Min Ji needs to improve her ball handling if they wanted to capitalize the potential pass plays with those 2.\n\n\nShe look slow and gassed, but some of players either new or casual is transformed **when they joined in show** so it will not be an issue to her as long she\u2019s committed on strength and conditioning.",

            "comment": "Man, I have been trying to be logical with my predictions but every single match from the start of this league has blown me away. New players, new positions, new rules, and tons of new records being made. I still can't believe &gt;!NatFam lost this match to WonderWoman (the team I anticipated to be relegated along with Anaconda last league).!&lt;\n\n!! Spoilers ahead, too lazy to tag specific parts so don't read if you haven't watched this ep. !!\n\nI can't believe how Kisum has grown and flourished in her role as gk. Usually, new gks with no training and that were recently switched cuz they couldn't find their role on the fields turn out like NatFam's Seohyun, not thrive and lead her team to victor; WW would've 100% lost if Kisum was playing as defender or tried to be on offense. Also of note, their rookie player Seolhee making all the records from being the 1st red card recipient, getting her debut goal, and probably beating out early days Shooting Stars in terms of accidental bulldozing (nobody, not even her own team is safe). \n\nI was totally rooting for NatFam cuz Minji looked like such a strong addition but it's unfortunate losing Mira meant Suyeon was really the only senior player (in terms of exp.) left and she just couldn't hold together a team of new and injured players. It's sad but they didn't just lose in terms of skills but mentality too given that Minji and Suyeon seemed like the only players who actually gave it their best to play. I am also honestly shocked at just how bad Minjeong is? She's supposed to be around Suyeon's lvl of exp given how long she's been in Shooting Stars but she has had nearly zero improvement. In fact, this game, she was genuinely a detriment to her team by crowding around the ball and blocking her own teammates from advancing to their opponent's half. With Heejung injured and MiHae's lack of stamina, it felt very much like a 2v6 game. I hope with more practice and Heejung healing up, they can actually form a somewhat capable offensive with Minji. It's gonna be rough when Seohyun is still better suited on the field than as a gk but I have even less confidence in Minjeong and Mihae has room for improvement so...a rock and hard place for WW this league.\n\nNEXT EP THO! The Giants are my absolute fav and the fact that Irene is now gone (even tho I was warned by my fellow redditors beforehand) and Jinkyung is somehow back (players can come back! this is huge!!!), Giants now feel more in flux. Before this, I was sure they could still eke out a victory against World Class since Kyunghee is rapidly improving and Hyunyi's passes are no joke now but these changes and the weird rotating gks from the preview worries me. That coupled with the facts that Saori seems to have lvled up a bit, Kathy has been steadily improving, Naty nearly showing up her entire team, and the past 4 eps have been upset after upset, WC might actually be the underdog victor yet again. It's gonna be an exciting episode regardless of the result. Hats off to the staff and crew of the show because I am absolutely pumped for Shooting Stars every week and if SBS can keep this up (the new sponsors seem to be an extra incentive for them to not drop the ball here), I can see them sweeping the variety charts this year and making Shooting Stars a mainstay in their programming.",

I thought of the bunch, Seorin was gonna be the gk since she showed some grit *in the matches i rmb her in* but I guess they're gonna keep rotating and just pray they get more goals in than they lose? Idk, that red card bringing Jinykung out could be what loses them the game since she's solid as a defensive player too. if they have to play like their usual minus Irene... I'm scared. Fingers crossed they get through this period safely and find a more permanent solution to their goalie problem.\n\nedit: got seorin and jungsun mixed cuz seorin was in dark horse last time and the recent streaming fighters one was actually jungsun. whoops.",

Team that can play stable zone defense is the only one who can control FC Gucheok this season. If FC World can break through Gucheok's three players with speed and accuracy, they will have a chance. Saori and Naty need to be on top of their game for next week and not missing any chance. HaeNa is a good defender due to her massive experience, but speed is the only way to beat her. JinKyung might have to go back to defending to shore up their defense.\n\nEither way, I love these two teams, especially with JinKyung coming back.",

I'm willing to bet she will continue to be effective. Coaches can try to coach up all they want, elite speed like that is going to be a shock to nearly every player and the added pressure for them to hurry up before the pro-sprinter bares down on them is going to lead to more mistakes, not less. This is still super amateur futsal and barely anyone is good enough in skills to shut Minji's speed down. Think about how few players can dribble well enough to get the ball out of the way of her baring down on them and have her blow by empty-footed and now way out of position.",

SooYeon has some experience with that and her husband Kim ByungJi can coach her a bit too.\n\nMy ideal set up with NF would be 2-2 formation.  Hwang HeeJeong and Kim MinJi as the defenders and have SeoHyun and MiHae as the forwards.  MinJeong needs the Perma sub since I don't see anything positive in her game right now.  She has plateaued and plateaued near the bottom.\n\nWith this game finished, my challenge league rankings are now WW first, BD second, SF third, and NF suspended.\n\nI would be saddened to see NF getting suspended since I was actually cheering for them to beat PSY and the FM team in the first super league gold medal match.

Not to mention the mental state of the senior players on the team.\n\n1. Putting SooYeon as a goal keeper is a stable option since she was a reliable keeper, but that will open up the defense too much.\n2. SeoHyun used to be a good striker, but at this level now, she still lack speed and power even with her great positioning.\n3. MinJeong has to be a sub, just pure disruption to her own team with no visible improvement at all.\n4. HeeJeong's injury might be a hold up to her mental state while playing and her unproven skill so far. The All Star game showed her lack of skills compared to all the AS players.\n5. MinHae is a skilled player but she were playing against an overzealous FC Wonder. Her handling might fooled Wonder, but that will not work against a more patience FC Stream and FC Ballad\n6. MinJi just need help that currently not available to her. She is not skilled enough to carry a whole team like LJE from season 1. Plus her speed is still manageable for the other team because of their solid defense. Plus her playing style is now out in the open. Coaches and their tactics.\n\nI am just hoping that this team can stay intact for the next season because only time will heal their problem, but they have a a high possibility of suspension for next season.",

Minji would be wasted on defense since she has a lot of speed but lack the necessary control or experience to position herself well and mark the other team. Heejeong alone also wouldn't be enough since she's small and can't yet mark a player completely.\n\nAs for the offense, I agree Seohyun could work as a forward since she's gotten a goal before and could work on those skills since gk is def not her style. However, Mihae is just way too slow and weak to be a forward. She has some technical skills (so maybe midfielder altho passing is still iffy) but she seems to lack the finishing needed; most players will be able to outpace/bully her so she'd lose out on a lot of counterattacks too. Albeit an unfair comparison, if she's able to play a similar role to ex-NatFam player Jungeun, who is able to give her team opportunities, set the pace, anchor the team so no rushed/panicked decisions, and score the winning goals, then sure, she doesn't need to be quick but I don't see Mihae filling any of those roles in a sufficient manner in the short amount of time they have (if it's even possible since NatFam's holes are too glaring). It's really, really unfortunate but like you said with how much of a mess NatFam seem to be in, I don't see them avoiding relegation at this rate.\n\nMy challenge league rankings are actually SF first, BD and WW duking it out with BD coming up victorious for 2nd place since WW has yet to shore up their defense, WW therefore 3rd, and NF last. SF is still very new but they're all strangely very committed to the show and all have potential (bar maybe the analyst whose name eludes me rn). Yeawon seems shoo-in as a forward, 1weekdieter/Juyeon has given me star gk vibes despite being fixed on the spot most of the time, and Eunmi and Euddeum (the two physical monsters) have a lot to give as well, especially after a bit more training. It's a bit presumptuous to say they're gonna win when they just debuted but Top Daddy seems to have great luck in that regard. Even if they don't win against WW, they have a lot of momentum going forward so I don't think they'd lose out on a lot of goals. So unless WW somehow scores a lot against BD, which I doubt given how Seogi and Kyungseo seem eager to get revenge and win their next match, they are in a great position to win the overall Challenge League. All of this said, this season has been so off the rails, everything is very much still up for grabs.",

The way I see it, Ga-Young will mark her and Hong-Ja will prowl on loose balls and poor passes. And Hee-Jung has shown that she can mark Kyoung Seo from end to end a couple of seasons ago. Sorry to say, but the reason why BD hasn't been winning as of late is because, Kyoung Seo and Seogi's game is too predictable and Seo Moon Tak is too slow, they need Minseo to return to the field instead of protecting the goal.",

She's probably the only one in the history of the show that shows LITERALLY 0 improvement. It's her 3rd season and I really don't understand what she practiced. I don't even expect her to dribble or so. She overlapped with her teammates 100 times a game is just infuriating to watch. &gt;!Unless Hwang Hee Jung recovers or two new ladies improve miraculously, they look like 1000% guaranteed to be eliminated !&lt;\n\nBut hey, &gt;!Kim Jin Kyung !&lt;unexpectedly returns to the show. &gt;!FC Giants !&lt;now has a monstrous roster and the next week has to be super exciting to watch",

They lost a stalwart player in Irene, even though she was in poor form in the gold medal match, losing experience and on top of that experience for goalkeeper position will hurt the Giants.  Getting a current field player to learn something totally different may be their obstacle for this season.\n\nSadly I have to agree with the MinJeong assessment.  I see no positives in her play.  I can see positives with all the other NF players but her.  Even with her one shot on target.  I am hoping she can improve but in reality she had plenty of time to improve.  She needs a coach that can teach her from the beginning.  There is no reason she can be as horrible as she is in terms of positioning like today's game.  Literally running at the ball when her teammate is already a step faster and closer to the ball.  Then also clearly in her teammate's path when she should be no where near that part of the field.  She should be running down a wing to receive a pass.",

I really liked Jinkyung and she was developing really, really nicely before she left. I love this for the show and for FC Giants. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Secondly, this is big for the Giants. I don't know if Jin Jeong Sun will be even a decent goalie but Giants having Hyunyi, Kyung Hee and Jinkyung is huge. That's a strong offensive team. Question is, Seo-rin, Hae Na and Jin Jeong... how are they on defense? That could be a big weakness.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Thirdly, losing Irene likely hurts. Irene was solid but she did look like she was regressing, playing poorly in that All-Star game. Question is how much worse is Jin Jeong Sun? If she's overall not too much of a downgrade than the upgrade of Jinkyung is far worth the loss of Irene. I do hope she gets a legit send-off as an iconic OG cast member. I hope she took the time to do an interview and hopefully we see the moment she told her team and hear her explain why and such. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Lastly, let me adjust my prayer: Dear Korean futsal Gods, thank you for giving me Jinkyung back but I ask a bit more of you. Now that we're getting players back like this, can you please give me at least one of Song Sohee and Ju-myeong. Thank you. !&lt;",

This sounds harsh but they'll do more than fine once Minjeong is back on the bench. I'm really excited to see Minji and Heejeong lead the offense! I think Seohyun will get used to being a goalie fairly quick too. She was sticking way too close to one side of the net when she gave both goals. It'll be an easy fix. Not sure why they keep building up when the WW has a player like Gayoung though.\n\nKisum had a very impressive goalie debut! Feels like this is exactly what she needed because she wouldn't reign in her overeagerness otherwise. She's had a better game today and all of the previous games combined. \n\nWish we got to see Amy play more, but Ha Seokju cares way too much on physical traits (as we've seen in Bulnabang, still bitter don't mind me) over training so not hopeful she'll get a lot of playtime over Seolhee.",

None of the current player can be a captain, except MinJi because of her strong personality. But she is a new addition to the team. Look at all the other teams' captains with the strong personality and mentality. Even Ballad got a few players that better suited to be captain than Seogi when looking at their personality.\n\nShe need to learn from HyeJin (former Gucheok) on how to pull a team together. Remember how bad was Gucheok was from the beginning, but their captain pulled them through and instilled \"Gucheok\" mentality into them. Look at them now.",

            "comment": "* I like the additions on both teams. Finding talent that are athletic and take to soccer quite naturally right away mean that they won't have problems playing the game, endurance-wise, that they start off with decent play and they often develop quite quickly. See Kang Soyeon, Amy, Dayoung, Minseo and Ju-myeong (former WW) as examples of those things. Not like Seogi or Song Sohee with previous soccer experience but instead athletically fit and much more natural to the sport than a lot of the ladies in the pilot and season 1. \n* Kisum to goalie seems like it could be a great move. Even in the practice and warmups she seems comfortable back there, even with the balls flying at her and her having to take hits from them. Her mentality during the warm-up \"Don't go easy on me, go all out with your kicks\" shows an aggressiveness you want. Also if she can help with set plays and the build up similar to Minseo (the new gold standard goalie imo) along with her having no issues being loud and vocal, then that's a potentially big upgrade. Seeing her move up and even have the knowledge to go low to block the ball when Min Ji was coming downfield at her was great. Other goalies woulda been passive and not came out and some other goalies running up to block it collide with her and get her and/or themselves hurt.\n* I predict Kisum and Minseo will be the shows best goalies very soon, if they aren't already. \n* It's a BOLD move to move not only your teams leading scorer but the LEAGUES leading scorer to goalie. I can't say I particularly love it but if there were no other options then it had to go down like that. \n* I get the vibes from Mi Hae that she's a less OP version of Lee Jung-eun. Her ball dribbling skills right away say I'm a sibling to a pro player. She just needs to build her confidence (she seemed timid, her first game and playing/being on TV) and once she can dribble like she does AND pass the ball ball accurately, she'll be a really good player. Kinda Seogi-esque with dribbling around defenders then passing to her teams striker who shoots it.\n* Man, Min Ji has that \"I'm a real athlete\" fire to her. On this show and likely to the always sensitive Korean public watching it will seem overly aggressive but this isn't a charity league and she plays sports for real. She's likely an A-type personality with a burning desire to win and that's how she got where she is as a sprinter. They can't just turn off that competitiveness. \n* The yellow and red card for Seolhee... I mean, some newbie was bound to make those classic newbie mistakes but luck not go their way and result in multiple penalties. She just needs training to know how to attack the ball and not trip her opponents. No big deal, unlike if the show had a somewhat dirty player or overly aggressive player who played rough. I'm happy they edited in what Segoi and the new coach said. Not only is it right but coming from the right people it will help protect Seolhee from criticism and bullying from Knetizens. \n* Lol, I adore Yea Won. Her begging the coach to teach her how to dribble like Mi Hae... I'd do the same thing. \"WTF, why aren't you teaching me how to do that?!\" lol. For real though, Mi Hae's skills, like Lee Jung-eun, just prove you don't need to go fast or be fast to get through the defense. When some of the top talent in the league learn even just one or two of those dribbling moves they'll be able to get past soooo many players. \n* Seolhee taking those shots, improving each time progressively, and then scoring was really cool. Yet again, the level of play from newbies can maintain the quality of play the show currently has when the show casts new talent well. Props to Seohyun for diving for that kick. I don't think she's a natural goalie like say Kisum who doesn't have a problem with contact and such, but she doesn't play afraid of contact and she knows enough about soccer at this point to do the job well. Not many goalies are diving like that to prevent a goal. \n* Then the second WW goal... NatFam got good young talent but if I'm not mistaken they are both now the teams strikers. Two newbies as your offensive players is rough, especially when it means your league leading scorer has been moved to goalie. The lack of offense made it apparent. This game makes me wonder if NatFam will struggle if not get suspended. If they can stick together and develop, they could be good again. Hopefully even if they get suspended they play in the FA Cup and during the suspension they train together and individually and then come back with a vengeance. Honestly though, it woulda been much better for NatFam to find Min Ji and a replacement goalie so Seohyun could stay on offense. I know they had a player out hurt (Hee Jung) but she was a defender iirc and while that woulda helped their defense, what they need is a goalie so Seohyun can be on offense. A healthy Hee Jung is too small to be a goalie. Am I misremembering? Was she a somewhat offensive player? Even if she was I don't remember her being a memorable player in terms of offensive skills. \n* I loved NatFams coaches speech during his timeout. He's absolutely right and he's making them responsible for their mentality on the field (not giving up, give your all) by putting his \"job\" on the line. \"You quit on the game while there's time left? I quit\". LOVE it. \n* Min Ji showed way more than enough to me for her speed to be DANGEROUS once she gains a few more skills. She's not just fast, she can dribble and she can shoot. She just needs the finer details like keeping the ball close, knowing when to take the shot and being able to shoot accurately at the goal from all different spots on the field.",

But The thing Kisum and Minseo are doing that iirc neither of those are is being so active and good at field play. They both are really good at coming out from the goal and defending downfield. They both are really good at being part of the offenses build up. They both are really good at being part of set plays. If they were good at those things but middling at defending shots on the goal then I'd be hesitant to crown them the best but they are really good at that too. So I think they are the best or soon to be crowned (after a few more games of hopefully quality play) because they are doing everything a goalie can possibly do and doing it really well.",

NF has interesting new players the combo of mihae\u2019s ball control plus Minji\u2019s speed could be deadly if properly capitalized. Too bad they didn\u2019t sync. The issue is the whole team could not pass, it\u2019s a fundamental necessity. The coach said he was working on getting them to develop a buildup, couldn\u2019t tell by the way they were playing. Also it\u2019s expected but the overlap/bunching was terrible. MinJeong isn\u2019t even a new player she was the worse one that kept bumping into people. Not trying to hate on her or but she has not shown a lot of growth. \n\nThe result was obvious tho, replacing 1 player vs replacing 2 players. &gt;!Both new goalies but Kisum had experience. HongJa and Heejung deserve a lot of unspoken credit for that first goal. HongJa flew to save the ball from going out and kept their possession for the kickin. Heejung did great passing for their set pieces. Kim Gayoung is their best player, it\u2019s too bad no one on her team can really keep up with her!&lt; WW did well with high pressing early. They need stamina work tho, they were too gassed in the second half. I would like to see them fight SF next.\n\nI like both WC and GT, I think that GT will win.

Seo-Hyun was a pretty good forward back in season 1, I believe she even won a mid-season award back then for scoring goals. I think she's still a better forward than Min-Jeong and it should have been her at GK than Seo-Hyun. \n!&lt;\n\n&gt;!This game is closer than the final score suggests One The Woman's game plan was just a level above NatFam's. Also OTW was better coached in this game. Ga-Young, in my opinion, is the second best player in the entire show with Kim Bo-Kyung at no. 1. She's fast, can control the ball, can stop Kim Minji from behind with her speed, and has wicked power in her shots, plus she's accurate too, unlike Kyoung-Seo. The only gripe I have with OTW is that their new player is too clumsy. She had 3 bad tackles, and even got a red card(the first in the show) because of it. I fear that she'll seriously injure the smaller girls like Seogi and Kyoung-Seo with her reckless tackles.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!In NatFam's case, I was screaming at the screen for Seo-Hyun to kick the effin' ball instead of throwing/rolling it to the defender cuz OTW is so good at cutting off passes. Also, Seo-Hyun was way out of position to properly block that second goal. Well at least Min Ji's speed is threatening to FC Balladream because their defense is just too slow, plus they'll have a better offense once Hee-Jeong returns from injury. I don't know how they'll do against SF, though I have a feeling it'll go to a shootout.!&lt;\n\nOnto next week's game, who else got excited when they showed Kim Jin-Kyung returning for FC Giants? Because I was freaking out when they showed her. FC Giants are my favorite to win the Super League now because of her. FC World Class though, is undefeated against the Giants, through 3 seasons. Whoever wins, we're gonna have a good game regardless.",

No prospect for this team this season at all. The constant change in players and coaches is at fault here. They will need time (a lot of) time to grow which I am afraid they never will have. No offense, no defense and no keeper int his game. They were not match ready at all. I am praying for a miracle for them.\n\nFC Wonder was the same team, with a more seasoned experience and an even more aggressive spirit. They were charging full speed ahead and might become a tough competitor in the Challenge League. How do a you handle a team whose not afraid of the ball and keep charging? They will get more skill with their touches and even more confident as the season moves along.\n\nOn an interesting note, another red card for the next game preview.!",

She is only worsening her team when she is on the field getting in teammates way or running routes that are terrible.\n\nMiHae needs to get stronger and use her footwork to be a ball carrying asset.\n\nMinJi needs to control her speed and toughness with timed runs and planned counterattacks.\n\nSooYeon needs to work on her shooting which wasn't terrible before but was terrible this game.  Her pass selection was terrible but her hustle on defense was good.  She also needs to be unemotional as a captain.  Like Chae RiNa of TopGirl she needs to gather her team and regroup and be more vocal.\n\nSeoHyun is being wasted by not playing the field. She might not be the fastest but she is always in the right place at the right time.  \n\nHeeJeong never really showed much in the all-star game.  She was also doing what MinJeong does so often and get in the way of teammates. \n\nThe coach needs to start from the beginning and teach the team how to position themselves properly on the field.  They also need to improve their field vision.  Don't go where the ball is but where the ball will be going.  Pass to the position of the person's running route rather than at their feet in the instantaneous moment, which will lead to a pass behind them.\n\n until their next game NF has time to work on their fundamentals and positioning.",

That makes those sketchy challenges by KISUM and the giraffe on her legs/foot very cringe to watch. And as a opposing player too that must bu scary AF as they come to realise they could literally be retiring an active nat atlete...

ChaeYoung, a new player of FC Bullabang should fit more of FC TopGirl too.\n\nBut I guess wherever there is an opening. I think having a same career background does help the team chemistry a lot. It helps the players bond together better since it is a team play. You can see why FC Gukdae never have that cohesiveness that are so apparent in other team. Also contant change in line up does not help either. This can be said for FC Wonder too in the beginning. Only the OGs players in the team get along better now since they have been together for a while now.",

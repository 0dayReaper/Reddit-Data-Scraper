The vibes it gives and the overall editing makes you feel that falling in love is the most beautiful thing ever. Also, visually, the contestants is usually the style I like. It feels like a movie with amazing music choices. Additionally, as someone who likes game shows, the little thing at the end where the panel guesses who picks who gives me more reason to love the show.",

Something about that season feels so real to me, like I felt that everyone in that cast was being sincere and following their hearts.

No script, tons of dramas (but not toxic), beautiful casts, wonderful chemistry, everyone gets their own story and closure, no one is irrelevant. Some of the scenes are so powerful and raw I can\u2019t even think any kind of movie/drama can replicate those.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s for everyone though as it\u2019s a bit heavy.

I was immersed too deep I followed the hashtag on twitter despite not having an account. \n\nHeart Signal 2 &amp; 3 was fun too but I do prefer the second over the third. Diversity of the casts were fun and feel more real than full of only celebrities and influencers. \n\nEden 2 and Singles Inferno 2 (I didn\u2019t watch the first one for both), I watched solely because I want to know the end for one of the cast, but in no way I\u2019ll be rewatching again. As for Pink Lie, the lies were imbalance and no really likeable cast for me, I dropped it and just read the thread to know the update. Love Catcher in Bali doesn\u2019t excite me much, I\u2019m still watching to know who are money catchers. \n\nSpecial mention, Heart Signal spin-off, Friend was fun since I got to know their updates and interactions, but some parts were obviously scripted, &gt;!*unnecessary blind date*!&lt;.",

LC3 is alright but I think 2 and 4 are better.\nI did not enjoy Eden 2, Eden 1, nor Pink Lie to the point where I dropped all three. Of these Pink Lie is probably the better show.\nTransit Love 2 is good but just a warning that the episodes get very long towards the end!\nI enjoyed all Heart Signal seasons.\nSingles Inferno I honestly didn\u2019t care for much, but I liked season 2.\nI am Solo - I definitely recommend season 6!! Definitely differs by the season but all in all the cast are commoners using pseudonyms so they\u2019re actually hoping to find a partner rather than just get fame and exposure.",

            "comment": "For Korean shows, Love Me Actually is still my #1. Obviously, it's not as serious as the other shows as some of the cast are comedians (e.g., Yang Se Chan\u2014Yang Se Bari), actors/actresses, and so on but it got me into the genre. Also, if you've watched Business Proposal, Min Gyu is in it and it feels great to have discovered him before he became popular. I still remember crying from a certain CP.. GAHHH. From there, I binged all the Heart Signals and just about every good show with subs. So I'd say my top 3 are Love Me Actually, Heart Signal, and Transit Love. S2, in particular, for HS and TL. I also enjoyed Pink Lie and watch I Am Solo. I Am Solo is good if you want to watch a show where couples actually get together, with some getting married, because I'd say a good majority in other shows break up (but some of the seasons are pretty mid and not all the earlier ones are subbed).\n\nIf you're down to watch Chinese romance varieties, mannnnn. Aside from the abundant and blatant advertising, I prefer the editing, videography, and certain casts (chemistry wise) much more. Heart Signal Chinese version (s2 and s5 in particular), imo is on par or even better than some of the best HS Korean seasons. Got so into to the Chinese seasons, that I scavenged for their Weibos for dating updates.. ANYWAY. Chinese show wise, Heart Signal and Twinkle Love are my top picks. Twinkle Love s1 gave me the worse post-show depression ever. Twinkle Love is like Heart Signal but instead with a much younger cast (usually university students) and it's available on YouTube (Youku Channel). Honorable mentions for Chinese shows would be other Youku shows, SO In Love, Hello Summer, and Relationship S3.",

            "comment": "Anyway, for specifically Korean, it depends on you. \n\nI like **Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774)** quite a bit because of its secret shame concept. But some people didn't like how it was initially slow in the beginning and so on. Yes, they could have done it better, but it's still worth a watch and rewatch, IMO, as you try to find existing or non-existent initial hints about the cast's secrets after you've finished the show.\n\n**Secret Man and Woman (\ube44\ubc00\ub0a8\ub140)** is the more low budget version of Pink Lie but some people genuinely prefer it or enjoyed it more, as it's got different secrets and situations and so on.\n\n**REA(L)OVE** is like the predecessor to Pink Lie and Secret Man and Woman. Long story short, REA(L)OVE can get dark and real offensive due to the hosts/panelists but they're clearly trolling, so just watch until the end if you want to see the secret shame and so on concept at its current peak (with the secret/shame/etc. concept, nothing has really topped REA(L)OVE since its Netflix release in 2018).\n\n---\n\nHeart Signal (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110) is a classic, don't forget the Heart Signal spinoff called Friends, watch Season 2 and Season 3 of Heart Signal first more more context.\n\nThe EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560) series is also another fan favorite or classic now.\n\nThere's this show called **Sleeping Only Relationship (\uc7a0\ub9cc \uc790\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774)**, it was so ridiculous and hilarious, like it's not even close. You'll likely be howling with the panelists, from laughter and shock, like rofl.\n\nIn Sleeping Only Relationship there's hysterical af scenes due to some cast members, like it's actually crazy how unexpectedly funny the show was. It starts off with gloomy rainy weather but ya imagine if they had better filming conditions and production, it would've been maybe way better.\n\nSleeping Only Relationship doesn't have an official English sub. But it does have a fan sub right now from iheartu2 (from Youtube and Twitter), check their Twitter and Youtube pages for more info, they're also subbing Chain Reaction. There's actually machine-translated subs right now for the rest of Sleeping Only Relationship and Chain Reaction but they often skip dialogue.\n\n---\n\n**I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO (/r/IamSolo)** is also hilarious sometimes.\n\nI Am Solo is kinda an outlier since those are people in their late 20s and like say 40s that want to actually get married. So they already have their own set careers, property, et cetera. And the show has, believe it or not, basically the highest success rate for relationships/marriages after the show, lol.\n\nI Am Solo is more raw, real, et cetera, kinda like Ainori: Love Wagon as it's so funny/awkward/etc. too. Some people from that short and fast-paced show did get married, they somehow succeed in that part.\n\nAnyway, **Season 7 of I Am Solo has this legendary girl named Ok Soon**, so people have expectations with her name now. But these past few seasons (we're on Season 12 now) they probably purposely miscast people to remove the fame attached to the name.\n\nSeason 7 starts at Episode 39, ends with Episode 44. Each season of I Am Solo is say 6-8 episodes and they can be watched standalone, no need to watch the previous seasons.\n\n---\n\nDon't forget to check out the Chinese dating shows in those thread links from the other comment: **https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10alz1h/best_kdating_show_in_your_opinion/j45ubco/**\n\nThese days Chinese dating shows are actually sometimes way better than some Korean dating shows. You just have to bear through the blatant in-show advertisements. As the housemates and the panelists themselves will often randomly segue into a scene with like the sponsored flavored drink, laundry detergent, app/software, et cetera, lol.\n\nChinese dating shows are also often free and with English subs on Youtube, especially the YOUKU dating shows. So it's easy accessibility. If they don't have (proper, sometimes they'll use machine autotranslate/etc.) English subs, check the own websites of the streaming services (like YOUKU, iQIYI, WeTV/Tencent Video, etc.), they'll probably have some English and other subtitles there.\n\n---\n\nThere's **Twinkle Love (\u6026\u7136\u5fc3\u52a820\u5c81)** for one of the best Chinese dating shows, and it's really good if you want more of say young adult friendships, youth nostalgia, traveling, and so on. It's kinda like Ainori Love Wagon but in China.\n\nBtw, Ainori Love Wagon: Asian Journey and African Journey are available on international Netflix. And it has way older seasons (from the 2000s) that have no English subs and are only available in Japanese Netflix/sites. Ainori is a more raw, fast-paced, etc. show, it's really fun though.\n\nAnyway, there's no doubt that Twinkle Love is one of the best shows for coming of age trips/events. Sorta like **Terrace House: Boys &amp; Girls in the City** youthfulness.\n\nBasically for Twinkle Love they're university students that are having a field trip, lol. So they get missions, dates, et cetera. They got them islands too, kinda.\n\nTwinkle Love has a lot of friendships formed in the show, you get to see bromances, sismances, etc.\n\nAs in it's one of the best shows for platonic friendships and all that, and you can see them shipping each other and so on, lmao. Like OMG (with NewJeans: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZAgIHmHLdc), they're so meta with Twinkle Love sometimes.\n\nIt's also a great show if you want to go back/forward to that freshness of young adult life ([btw, flamingos and parrots are geese] (https://www.reddit.com/r/heartsignal/comments/ns11y8/friends_share_life_terrace_house_twinkle_love/)).\n\n**For Twinkle Love, at the end of each day they have to record a message for the person they liked/spent time the most. And listen to their own message (through earbuds) IN FRONT OF EVERYONE, so it's kinda dramatic af, lol.**\n\nTwinkle Love is free on the YOUKU channel on Youtube, they have English subs.\n\n**Twinkle Love Season 1 Episode 1**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxP-Ye9kr24\n\n**Twinkle Love Season 2 Episode 1 Part 1**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78vUkTAhuG8\n\n---\n\n**Check MyDramaList too for a more visual list of these dating shows**. Some people have their lists with only Korean shows, others Chinese, some combined, et cetera.\n\n**A master list (of Korean dating shows) that some people update fairly regularly**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Igp0Nh8w46uA7uumTYeWoG4wV1kc4BJAn3R4cZgE7Uk\n\n**This is a fan playlist of some Chinese dating shows (often available on Youtube for free through the YOUKU, iQIYI, Tencent Video/WeTV, etc. official channels)**: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNnLfxJ2ybB2BW4sjK1VTinwrySp7A_R\n\n**That playlist of Chinese dating shows also has its own Google Docs sheet for other Chinese (dating and variety) shows**: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12vG-7Qtu5KbNHGHFS8GNzolbf3Lmu_fUA0YL6lGXTAk",

It's like the difference between heaven and earth as what some /r/noveltranslations and /r/ProgressionFantasy (Chinese/Korean/Japanese/East Asian/etc.) web novels would say, lol. \n\nThe cultivation/cycling since Terrace House: Boys x Girls Next Door a decade ago, alas it has finally produced enlightenment/ascension. Immortalized.\n\nWhat an ensemble of visuals and everything, just wow.\n\nOne of the best seasons ever of any East Asian dating show.\n\n---\n\nNow with the finale of both Love Catcher in Bali and Single's Inferno 2, **Heart Signal 4 (Korean Version)** needs to come out soon, lmao. Wonder how the visuals will be.\n\nAnyway, don't forget **Terrace House (/r/terracehouse) and its Chinese version, Shanghai Sharelife (/r/Shanghaisharelife)**. Those are the classics of the dating show genre.\n\nSome people's list is probably like this: Shanghai Sharelife preferred over Terrace House, which is favored over **Heart Signal (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110)**, and now the **EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560)** series, with possibly **Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac)** and **Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774)** in tow.\n\nAt the moment the current influential dating shows in East Asia goes like this: Terrace House inspired Heart Signal and then Heart Signal gave way to Transit Love/EXchange. Single\u2019s Inferno is also kinda in this as a lot of island/beach/etc. shows got made because of it.\n\nTerrace House and so on have like 40 minutes per episode but they have dozens, hundreds of episodes.

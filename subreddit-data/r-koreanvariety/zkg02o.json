    "postText": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m ABSOLUTELY ADDICTED to mafia style survival shows and I\u2019m looking for some more recommendations! I\u2019ve really enjoyed Money Game, Black Sheep Game and Accomplice.\n\nI\u2019m absolutely desperate to watch Button Game (\ubc84\ud2bc \uac8c\uc784) and Partner Game (\ud30c\ud2b8\ub108 \uac8c\uc784) but sadly neither of those have been subbed in English yet so I can only wait and hope it\u2019ll happen someday.\n\nNext on my list will probably be Bloody Game!\n\nDoes anyone have any shows like these to recommend that I watch? I\u2019m really craving something new!",

It's made by the same PD that did The Genius series, so it deals a lot with players making their own alliances within their \"society\" and individual mini games.",

Maybe a but stale toward the end, but I enjoyed it.\n\nEdit: Actually it isn't a survival show, so probably not exactly ehat you're looking for. It's just a mafia game show and each \"game\" takes two episodes, then they start over.",

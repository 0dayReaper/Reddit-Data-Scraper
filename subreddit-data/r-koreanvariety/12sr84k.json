The moment they run out of time, they are checked out.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Chloe (Idol, Member of 'cignature')\n* Hong Jinho (Former Pro Gamer, Poker Player, Winner of 'The Genius')\n* Hwang Jeseong (Comedian)\n* John Park (Singer, Dreamboat)\n* Joo Eonkyu (YouTuber, Creator of 'Sinsaimdang')\n* Kim Hyunkyu (Actor)\n* Kim Namhee (Announcer)\n* Layone (Rapper)\n* Monika (Dancer, Leader of 'PROWDMON')\n* Shin Jiyeon (Student, Cast Member from 'Single's Inferno')\n\n# Notes\n\nAs was revealed last week, there was &gt;!a revival game between the first 4 eliminated players!&lt;, but unfortunately it looks like they had so much content to show that they didn't have time for this in the actual episode, so they released it as a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaEVXetSLig). Not subtitled (and unlikely to get officially subtitled), but you can watch to get a sense of gameplay/results if you're interested. Baechu Squad might subtitle it, but it's not for certain since we're pretty busy with other projects and such.",

            "comment": "I think this week's episodes were a good end to a narrative that has been around since the first episode, &gt;!which is Eonkyu's goal to eliminate Jinho. In a way he did beat him but his own demise got to him first and it showed by him just being reckless.!&lt;\n\nIt was probably annoying for &gt;!Jinho!&lt; to have been a target by a single person throughout the start of the game, and I understand some people didn't like that but thats just part of &gt;!Jinho!&lt; being &gt;!Jinho!&lt;. Some may complain that he was being targeted from the start which they didn't like but that reputation is also why people prefer working with him because of the image he has, and that reputation goes both ways. Its also very common to hear the phrase \"I'd rather lose to the winner\" as a sort of way to save face.\n\nI do think that &gt;!Eonkyu!&lt; had his moments but I didn't really like the way he used socializing and metgaming together, it just seemed like it didn't fit the show. Most of his \"reckless\" plays for me seemed like it fit Game of Blood than this show lol.\n\nI guess the last thing I wanna talk about are the games, I like my fair share of team games but for me personaly, it seemed like theres just TOO many games that requires alliances, I would've prefered more games that test the players themselves. Its also what I didn't like when I was watching the Genius, I never really liked their Death Matches where the other players had a say in the result, and I'm not saying that its to that extent in The Time Hotel, but I do get reminded of it in most of their games.\n\nAnd, when people talk about luck, well luck is just luck. Can't do anything about it so get over it, you know who you people are lmao",

            "comment": "The way TVING gave &gt;!us snippets of interview of Jinho and Eonkyu in earlier episodes, they directed us in a way that we wanted that matchup. That match going to the wire (final ball) and the underdog (some will call the antagonist) losing while doing the final punch, people will scream that is scripted.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Jinho had luck (some will argue plot armour) in ep 4 and 6, in ep 6 he was defeated fair and square if not due to circumstances that lead to his survival!&lt;\n\nAlso interesting is when it came out in mentoring/coaching checkout candidates, Eonkyu had a better track record than Jinho: Jinho tutored Namhee, who lost against Eonkyu. Jinho teamed up with Layone against Eonkyu and Chloe, Chloe won. &gt;!Even in ep 5 Jinho advised Siyeon, while Eonkyu was with Chloe, Chloe won.!&lt;\n\nRegarding &gt;!Eonkyu, for some he might be annoying, the footage TVING showed he is very vocal about his goals, he is here to play the games and matches (well that is the purpose of the show).\nProbably all his statements TVING showed to us, they have something similar from all the other nine contestants in some form. Probably TVING has footage of other contestants wondering why there is a non-working TV in the room, footage of people asking around which games will be played next, people studying board games in the morning etc.\nOn the one hand what he pulled off in ep 4 I thought was brilliant, (in some way the alliance pulled something similar in ep 5.), then in the next two episodes I cannot help shaking my head.!&lt;\n\nBut &gt;!he!&lt; was so entertaining.\n\nI watched it yesterday with a colleague. And that was his words about &gt;!Eonkyu!&lt; (not mine): &gt;!\"When Hong Jinho, Lee Sangmin, Jang Dongmin and Oh Hyunmin made a Dragonball fusion dance but it misfires, the result is Eonkyu.\"!&lt;\n\nRegarding my thoughts for the next rounds:\n\n&gt;!I haven\u2019t seen John, Jesung and to some degree Hyunkyu in a real crisis situation yet (ok Hyunkyu, when he was left dry in ep 4 thanks to Eonkyu).!&lt;\n\n&gt;!This is a bit different with Chloe. I think checkout games can be mentally draining, the ritual of mentally preparing for the game, packing your stuff, leaving the room and then fighting one-on-one over an hour (or longer) for your survival.\nI think she is now battle-tested with the pressure of being eliminated in two (of four) checkout games, an experience the others (exception of Jinho) don't have.!&lt;",

LOL  \n\n\nAlso, if Chloe didn't tell Eunkyu the trick to press the bell ASAP a star appear, he won't survive that many rounds. Otherwise, if both Eunkyu and  Jinho know  that same trick, Eunkyu will lost for sure.\n\nAt last, Eunkyu should have checkout when he decided to purchase 20 bottles of water. But, strangely, the staff/management \"interupted\" the game by refunding his purchase with suggestion. What the hell.",

Is he lab grown to be the anti-Jinho?\n\nFor every bit of Jinho's charisma, this guy oozes anti-social tendencies. For Jinho's easygoing nature, Eonkyu is uptight and awkward. For Jinho's honest alliance play, Eonkyu is a backstabbing solo player. Jinho indulges in hearty meals while Eonkyu diligently eats his daily side dish. Jinho gets drunk to unwind while Eonkyu abstains from alcohol \"so he can strategize.\" Jinho is beloved and Eonkyu is hated. \n\nI have never been so captivated by a villain in a survival show and &gt;!I am truly sad to see him go. I have a strong feeling that the rest of the episodes will just be the Jinho alliance painting by numbers until they get to Jesong, John Park and Jinho. It won't be as exciting without Eonkyu the troublemaker.!&lt;",

His irrational approach to the game helped him out more than you think, since Ji Yeon was approaching the game with an overly basic rational idea: 'The drug king won't pick the agents because they know who they are.' They only need a simple majority for the vote so putting in one of the agents isn't a big deal and Ji Yeon got betrayed by a simple way of thinking. In these types of games, an irrational person causing chaos is harder to read than someone who simply plays the game (As Jin Ho easily predicted the simple way of playing the game). I wouldn't say his teammates carried him as much as Ji Yeon outplayed herself.!&lt; \n\nOn another random note, I don't like how this show is strongly based around forming alliances. &gt;!Even as a Ji Yeon simp who would want to be on her side no matter what lmao.!&lt; I just want to see some good individual gameplay rather than trying to swindle teammates. I would love a Kakegurui-esque variety show.",

If you look at Jiyeon/Jeseong perspective, they are pretty sure that John and Hankyu are drug dealers while Eunkyu trying to act like a cop team to Jiyeon is also more likely to be on dealer side which leaves Jinho and Chloe as most likely to be CI. Choosing 2 cops in this round with 2 success rounds before that\u2026there is no way a cop won\u2019t show an X here. Jeseong should choose Eunkyu and John/Hankyu as a combination and cast X. Yes, he may get ousted as a cop but this is already the info that drug king (Jinho) already knew but there is a chance he may cast some suspicious on Eunkyu who act very wild and illogical which leaves the next person to have more hard time choosing people and Chloe will still remain hidden. Jinho (who was the next person) would then have more hard time to choose people for R4. If he didn\u2019t choose Jiyeon in R4, there was a high chance he would be a king who knew Jiyeon identity. Yes, the cop will likely lose the game but there was higher chance to guess the king. Anyway, R1 and the starting player is the most important and John played it perfectly by choosing Hankyu, getting info from Eungyu, acting like he had impossible roles and as I said in the other post, this game was very hard for the cop to win by winning 3 rounds so the only good chance is to guess the king!&lt;",

John is dealer and Hyun Kyu makes the bold move of revealing he is \"Enforcer 1\" (John is Enforcer 2). No one challenges the claim and the 2 secure an easy vote. !&lt;\n\nR2: &gt;!Ji Yeon interviews Eon Kyu who states he is the \"sniper\" (Ji Yeon is the sniper) which confuses her whether Eon Kyu either knows her role (King's power) or he is a lunatic. Ji Yeon tries to gain approval of the drug dealers and approves the vote resulting in 2/3 wins for dealers. !&lt;\n\nR3: &gt;!Chloe doesn't give Je Seong much information in interview and the Special Agent and Chief Investigator make the mistake of both voting X revealing that the vote contained 2 cops out of Je Seong, Chloe, and Eon Kyu.  The cops have a 0% chance of winning by votes from this point forward unless the players are dumb and vote against their own role. At this point Ji Yeon needs to make a 100% mental pivot and devote all her power to find the king.!&lt;\n\nR4-5 requires a simple majority vote to pass. Both rounds have 4 players and need at least 3 to win.\n\nR4: &gt;!Jin Ho is dealer pretends he is confused about Eon Kyu and pretends he doesn't know who Ji Yeon is by interviewing her. He picks the 2 safest players in John and Hyun Kyu along with Ji Yeon and himself. Result is 3 to 1 as expected and the vote passes resulting in the drug team winning. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Ji Yeon has been convincing herself that \"King\" wouldn't pick her if they knew she was an agent. Ji Yeon 'proved' herself back in round 2 by approving the vote. There is literally 0 reason for Jin Ho to pick anyone among Chloe, Je Seong, and Eon Kyu to try and pass the vote because 2/3 of them are cops learned from the previous round (He knows Je Seong is 1 with the King's power). Jin Ho would need to be extremely dumb to pick 2 cops even without the King's power with all the information that has been revealed up to this point. !&lt;\n\nSniper chance: &gt;!John took an extremely active role (As an enforcer). Hyun Kyu made his bold claim of being an enforcer without being challenged. Eon Kyu caused chaos by claiming the 'sniper' role in front of the sniper (Which plays into what the king's power is). Jin Ho was mostly passive until his turn (He claimed to want to pretend to be an enforcer). !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Ji Yeon's attention was mostly focused on Eon Kyu ever since he claimed he was the sniper and the fact that John played a strong leadership role. She was also focused on the idea that the King would never pick her and Je Seong because they know who the agents are. Unfortunately Je Seong outed himself as a risk in R3 (without the king's power). None of the other cops thought it was John, so she shot Eon Kyu. !&lt;\n\nEon Kyu: &gt;!Him making himself suspicious to the rest of the cast doesn't really matter at all. The fact he made himself suspicious is the entire point (as long as he is not the king) which benefitted the team because Ji Yeon sniped him at the end. John and Hyun Kyu are a guaranteed 2 votes by the end of R2 so confusing everyone doesn't do anything when they only need 1 more person for R4-5. It might not be planned at all, but there really is no downside to it other than making no one understand his role. The King is the only person that needs to avoid getting shot. !&lt;\n\nTLDR: &gt;!With how the roles and turns were laid out, it was almost impossible for the cops to win by voting after R1. This puts all the power into Ji Yeon's hands as the sniper. She got predicted and outplayed with an overly simple way of thinking. Combine that with what you said, Eon Kyu made himself \"suspicious to the rest of the cast\", then she fell for it.!&lt;",

Them thinking he's a cop does absolutely nothing to the flow of the game. The drug dealers wouldn't be able to start picking voters until R4, but Jin Ho would easily just pick John and Hyun Kyu anyways. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!But this game is different and gives a single player to alter the results of the game aka the \"Sniper.\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!\"Jin Ho's actions lowering his suspicion level\" by doing exactly what Ji Yeon was saying he wouldn't do. Jin Ho read the sniper like a book and Ji Yeon didn't break away from her simple \"logical\" way of thinking. The game didn't even reach R5 which would have been Eon Kyu's turn, yet he was the main suspect for the sniper? You keep mentioning logic and playing correctly, but based on her logic and correctness she shot the wrong person. !&lt;\n\nTLDR: &gt;!Plain and simple, the sniper missed due to a combined set of actions from the drug dealers. !&lt;\n\nSuper TLDR: &gt;!Sniper missed.!&lt;",

Same with police reveal in mafia game -- they just instantly cut to 3 cops discussing in the corner without showing a reaction from mafia members.\n\nI also wonder what happened to Han-Kyu's water bottle stash...\n\nEp 6\n\nHey, \"Unlimited Gem Auction\" is just revamped \"Investment and Donation\" game from Genius season 3! The one where Dongmin and Yuhyun were fighting to become miser.\n\nNice remix of [Smooth Invasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ll19vYqpgA) during auction.\n\nThe way how &gt;!Eon-Kyu and Chloe!&lt; kept cornering the market from both sides against the team of 4 guys was so funny -- they dominated entire game from start to finish.\n\nIn Four Arithmetic Operations game they really should have concentrated on harder, bigger numbers when your opponent makes a mistake and you have all the time.\n\nThe ending was super crazy, losing &gt;!by 2 seconds!!! However i wonder what would have happened if made it in time to eliminate Jinho first -- would he checkout immediately after him too?..!&lt;\n\nIt's also insane how &gt;!Jinho keeps avoiding checkout just by others making mistakes.!&lt;\n\nWith this last eliminee i wonder how the cast balance gonna play out because all the rest feel more like followers.",

He was betrayed because 2 of his team were absolute opportunists who happened to stumble upon a meeting, find out the subject of the game and begged jinho and co to protect them\n\nhe lost game 1, they won game 1, they had the suite, they had the info, they had the winner of the genius, unless EK had just straight up won game 1 which was incredibly unlikely, he had no chance of getting anywhere from the beginning because he immediately allied with people who were so weak that they couldn't win together day 1 and then crumbled and betrayed on day 2\n\nhe then proceeded to do a massively ballsy move and pick one of the alliance's core members for the death match, knowing that that would both be his best chance of breaking up the team dynamic and also inspiring the team back to him\n\nthen the team just.. straight up did not give a shit that he thoroughly demonstrated his competence and that they COULD win.  but he forgave chloe anyway and told her, I know you betrayed me, but we can still win. then because it was a pairs game, his team lost anyway, and both of the pair immediately ran to jinho for help\n\nhe, despite being betrayed by chloe, said ok - you both want jinho not me, I will coach chloe then, and then their team 5-0'd team jinho\n\nbut that wasn't enough, and with just some mere info about water, his team mate betrayed him once again. he clocked on immediately when he noticed he was given the wrong size of water, and realised that he couldn't win the next game because of yet another turncoat. so then he spent the next few hours engineering misinformation to break up their group, and did everything in his power to get his team back, and reforged it\n\nand with all that, they had a winning team. except then one of his team members inexplicably put the wrong number in and instantly got eliminated despite them having a winning strategy \n\nthen she came back after elimination and.. instantly decided to side with the other team again. then the other team thanks to john listening through the door managed to make his flip flopping teammate look extremely suspicious again and that broke up their alliance for good, but nonetheless he won. then he coached chloe, again, against jinho's counsel, to win again and eliminate his traitor\n\nat this point he only had chloe he could trust, and despite it being 4 vs 2 he managed to secure his teammate the #1 win of the day, and take jinho to the deathmatch... which he played the winning move of, but just ran out of the metagame of time\n\ndespite all the odds, all he did through the entire run was win death matches, coach his team to victory, and yet was constantly betrayed by every single member of his team, there is not one person who didn't betray him at least once and yet he still helped them and sided with them anyway\n\nif you've ever played board games before and everyone decides at the start that you're a threat and gangs up on you, if you care about winning, at that moment you become a demon and you do every thing you can in your power, you downplay your hand, you turn everyone against each other and you claw your way past every person until you seize victory from the jaws of defeat. in the metagame, he was instantly chosen, black marked from day 2, and literally had the entire house bet against him, a triple betrayal. he had every reason to play in full Punished Mode and he did, and he still outplayed them all. if this was the genius season 5 and not time hotel, it would be jinho going home and EK on top, probably EK to win the season too. he was dealt the absolute most dogshit hand in the history of the game since Kang yong-suk and yet miraculously ended up on top through pure skill, while jinho survived twice on sheer luck. I don't know how someone can look at this and blame EK, like there was some simple way to avoid all the noobs instantly betraying you instantly. any other contestant in that situation would've checked out that day",

            "comment": "Ep.4 revival game (has a little bit spoiler of Ep.5-6)\n&gt;!Although not sub yet, it\u2019s the exact same game with Ep.6 Kairos game which makes me wonder if they decided to use it from the start or they decided to use it in Kairos game because Jiyeon was eliminated. I think it was the later. The revival game isn\u2019t as crazy as the main game since it\u2019s everyone for themselves instead of 2 factions facing each other!&lt;\n\nEp.5\n&gt;!It\u2019s basically Avalon with 7 people so anyone who familiar with this game is going to have some advantages in this. Anyway, the rule seems to change in favor of drug dealer side a bit too much since Round 5 the cops need 2 cops out of 4 to win (in the normal Avalon, it needs only 1 cop in final round). So their chance of losing the main game is inevitable. Also I think the cop team makes a big wrong move by choosing Chloe instead of John Park or Hyunkyu. There is 2/3 chance that Eunkyu or Chloe is CI so it really is a big risk by choosing both of them and hope they are both innocent or that one of them is CI and think that they will choose O. Also, I can\u2019t believe they fall for the standard drug king/Merlin trick play by purposely choosing 1 cop in Round 4 and thought he has no chance of becoming a drug king. Anyway, perfect clean play by John and Jinho. Eunkyu is just lucky that his reckless betting this time works out!&lt;\n&gt;!Seeing GSB game, I think what someone said about Jiyeon in previous thread was corrected. She relies too much in playing logically and thinking inside the box too much. The moment she makes a mistake and loses count on rabbits, her game was tanked down the drain. This game needs a combination of logic and gut and she has no gut to make a risky move at all. Sad to see her go after the revival match (as I say, she was my dark horse pick since Ep.1) but Chloe is stronger in making risky decision and play better than her in this game.!&lt;\n\nEp.6\n&gt;! I will say that the match up between 2 sides is a tie as both player from both groups get selected to  the checkout game. I think Eunkyu-Chloe team plays a little bit better with having only 2 people, the use of double items and making Chloe first in the end. The 4-member alliance has to also survive on their own too though (while Eunkyu was ready to take the fall) so can\u2019t blame them.!&lt;\n&gt;!For the Checkout game, the thing that both players miss is they leave big number too long to get rid of especially 41 as that will hardly solve by other arithmetics other than star so the first chance they got a star, they should use it to eliminate 36 or 41 quickly instead of 18 or 19 which can be done by simple arithmetics. I was already sad when I saw Jinho was going to lose, went drinking some water, came back and shocked when it said Eunkyu was eliminated. Come on Jinho!!! His luck is amazing (or must I say Eunkyu reckless gameplay is even beyond amazing).!&lt;\n\nAnyway my ranking right now for remaining contestants:\n1. &gt;!John Park - Still believe he is the clear contender right now instead of Jinho, smooth gameplay by far. Still needs to prove he is still good in individual games later on but I think he won\u2019t have problems in that!&lt;\n\n2. &gt;!Hong Jinho - His favorite number, yeah!!! When it comes to later stages of the game with more individual games, I think he will be very dangerous. Hoping to see both him and John in final if not then\u2026!&lt;\n\n3. &gt;!Chloe - Yes\u2026yes, I will die on this hill, she is my real dark horse now!!! Surviving 2 check out games is something you need to give some applause. Her strategy for Eunkyu is really good in Arithmetic game (similar to me when I play along). Apart from Ep.3 (which she and Layone was a target) and Ep.5 (when she is a clueless CI), I think she played well enough, getting some helps from both sides and not make herself a big target like Eungyu yet. I hope she can pull a big surprise or at least making Top 4.!&lt;\n\n4. &gt;! Kim Hangyu - I will say he plays pretty well up to this point even getting wins in Ep.3-5 but I\u2019m still not quite sure about his individual game yet.!&lt;\n\n5. &gt;!Hwang Jeseong - He still needs to prove a bit more in individual games but so far he also played well. He didn\u2019t play bad at all as I believe all of them deserved to be in final in some degrees if they eventually makes it but I think other 4 are playing better game than him right now.!&lt;\n\nAll in all, I pretty like the cast even someone with annoying personality like Eunkyu also makes the show fun. Pretty good show so far and I hope we have a chance to get Season 2 in the near future.",

            "comment": "God damn that last check out game is probably the highlight of the season for me.\n\nEarlier when Eun Kyu tried to buy 20 bottles of water and they said he will probably run out of time if he did, then when he said 10 they said it would be cutting it close, I was like soo they wouldn't let someone check out from running out of time in the hotel cause someone failed to keep track of their remaining time? Well I thought that would have been an interesting way to check out and the fact that they're \"preventing\" people from going out that way kinda defeats the whole purpose of \"time\" hotel. Boy I shit you not, I was frozen stiff for a whole minute realizing what just happened.\n\nOverall I hate to admit this as a Jinho fan but I think Eun Kyu have shown he is the strongest player in the show as of this episode. His attention to small details is always on point like on EP5 when he noticed someone was outside the door of the suite. In Episode 5 he totall destroyed the 4 man alliance, he was in total control of that game. If he doesn't have such an unlikable personality(in game at least) then I believe he would have gotten a lot of fans already. I sure hope to see him on other shows like this, and maybe even a return on future seasons(if they make more). Jinho on the other hand have survived elimination twice by luck now. When he refused to swap cards and only the high numbers were remaining I thought for sure that he would lose because he's only depending on the star while eunn kyu who had high numbers can solve it with multiplication. If he doesn't even end up in top 3 then it would be so bad. Chloe was my least favorite girl after namhee and eun ji but she's really showing she has the skills and I'm liking her more and more right now. Overall the remaining 5 are top tier(except maybe hyun kyu) And I think anyone of them can easily take it.",

But before that they were totally outplaying the other team, making them bid high while they only spent a little. His game plan has always been to make chloe win and go to the checkout game himself. And he accomplished that gameplan. In my book that's a win. Jinho on the other also didn't win, his plan was to be in the middle but he failed that. Out of the two, one accomplished his goal and the other didn't.  \n\n&gt; but you're totally heroising his actions\n\nI'm just stating facts, statistically he has better performance compared to everyone else. If he beat Jinho he would have been the biggest champion contender. Everyone has their fair share of brilliance and terrible decisions but in the end it's the result that matters. And for me he had the most accomplishments after 6 episodes.",

And you're also disregarding the fact how he read them like a book and made proper bids that counters the other team. like when they made them overbid on an the items while they bid the bare minimum, or how they outbid them when they were buying double points, all this tactics was how jinho ended up with the least points in the first place. And that was when he purposedly went bankrupt, once jinho had the least amount of points. This could have been prevented by the 4 man alliance if they won the bids properly before.\n\n&gt; You're not just stating facts, you're describing events in super flattering ways\n\nAnd you're just denying it in super unflattering ways. I have not exaggerated any of his achievements but for some reason it seems your hatred for the guy blinds you from seeing that he is actually quite skilled at the gamme\n\n&gt;  Even if he beat Jinho, John Park would still be a better winner contender.\n\nI disagree. But now with the current people that's left I favor John more than Jinho. For me It's John &gt; Jinho/Chloe &gt; Je Seong &gt; Hyun kyuk\n \nEDIT: So I just read the comments in this thread and I noticed that everytime Eun Kyu is mentioned you immediately reply about how bad he is  which just makes you a bitter hater. And so I will not argue about this anymore, nothing healthy comes out of talking to a blind fanatic or hater.",

            "comment": "A bit late, just got into Time Hotel after having some free time over the weekend. I'm pretty impressed by how close Time Hotel is to The Genius in a good way. The show captures the politicking, hidden alliances and betrayals like in The Genius. What this show lacks so far is a main match that showcases an individual's skill, but hopefully it will come in the later episodes.\n\nEp5 &gt;!I think the Kairos match was too favorable for the Mafia. The only realistic way the cops can win is for the sniper to kill the boss. To be fair, the Mafia had the strongest players and the cops made too many mistakes.!&lt;\n\nEp6 &gt;!Not a fan of Eonkyu's strategy. From the beginning of the show until now, he was obsessed with challenging Jinho and found his opportunity in the Kairos match. He waited for when Jinho was in last place and then proceeded to intentionally bomb out so he could challenge Jinho. In a strange way, I do think it is a brilliant move because Jinho is the leader of the JJJ alliance and taking Jinho out would tear the team apart. But I feel like it's a very trolly way to play the game, since the other 4 players couldn't affect the outcome and had guaranteed safety from elimination.!&lt;\n\n**Thoughts on the cast so far:**\n\n&gt;!Chloe - She is the best individual player by far with two Checkout victories and coaching Eonkyu into almost winning his Checkout game. Her team game is interesting, playing as a neutral party and sides with whichever team appeals to her more on one particular day.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Jinho - Disappointed by his play so far. He is still a very charismatic person who can build strong alliances, but he's nowhere near his prime compared to when he was in Genius S2 and should have been eliminated twice already.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Jeseong - Extremely lucky middle of the road player who hasn't been an impact in any of the games or faced any threat of elimination.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!John - Most likely player to win. He is a triple threat, he is charismatic, strong and intelligent. Shown skill in Time is Gold (ep3), Complete P-R-S (ep4) and Drug King (ep5).!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Eonkyu - Don\u2019t like his trolly play, but he makes for an entertaining character. I thought his plan to bluff the JJJ alliance about knowing the Checkout game in advance (ep4) was genius. A shame that he had to go out like he did, but it\u2019s his own fault.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Hyunkyu - In the same bucket as Jeseong, but feel sorry for the guy because his only role in the show was to play as a spy or a double-spy.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Namhee - Thought she would make it very far. Showed understanding of how to play the game from day one.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Layone - Layone, who? Not a memorable player and he only seems to get screentime when Chloe is nearby.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Monika - Complete miscast, didn\u2019t interact much with the other players. Decided not to use her time to buy anything until it was too late.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Jiyeon - Initially thought she was just another pretty face, but proved that she is an extremely talented and capable player. Only downside was her play in the Checkmate match against Chloe. Really questionable decision making by calling on losing hands and then losing track of her opponent\u2019s bunnies.!&lt;",

In fact they couldn't play all 4 matches in a more dumber way. &gt;!E05 main match, they were talking about the secret gestures and stuff and HyunKyu praised Eon Kyu. I was already like wth are u guys doing?! The rules already stated that teams are decided randomly. In general, Cops made a very poor effort. 2 people unnecessarily voting no are purely dumb. Also Jiyeon could have easily deduced that Eon Kyu is either drug associate or assistant.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And the betting death match, holy, I swear both of them played this worse than some of the biggest fish in 2NL online poker. Both didn't have any clue how poker works  !&lt;\n\n&gt;!E06 main match, there could have been so much tactics if having a team of 4 people. Instead they just bid by instincts individually. It's actually embarrassing them losing despite the huge discrepancy of information both team had.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!E06 death match, let's just admit that both players are very bad at calculating. Pretty sure Kim Nam Hee would have annihilated them. It's comical that Eonkyu spent all his time pointlessly and eventually eliminated. The cards wasn't even the problem. He's just incapable of figuring out the answer. !&lt;\n\nIt's all bad but I'm especially disappointed how E06 main match played out. It's a well designed game and could have had so much potential",

                    "comment": "(Since it\u2019s already 2 days since release, I think I won\u2019t put anymore spoiler)\n\nFor Ep.5 main match: Sadly, there is no way Jeseong and Chloe knew that there is another cop in the group. Remember there are already 2 success, if they risk voting O then there is also a good chance that it\u2019s success and the game is then over. Them playing X is the right choice, the bad choice is how Jeseong choosing Chloe when there is high chance that she is CI. (As I said in another post). And yeah, the cop team falls for the simple trap that Jinho isn\u2019t Drug king because he chooses Jiyeon too easily when that\u2019s literally standard move for the king (Merlin in Avalon). Anyway, the cop played this round pretty bad but we should applaud John and Jinho for controlling the momentum of the game.\n\nEp.5 death match: I think you can\u2019t simply compare it to poker. For poker, the bluff can be done easier because there are many possible combinations that can happen. But for this game, the combination is very limited. Bluffing won\u2019t work easily and there is also a limit in their resources too. They have to spend rabbits wisely. \nI think Chloe played okay for a beginner but I must admit Jiyeon played it very poorly after she messed up her strategy and could not adapt.\n\nEp.6 main match: The 4 men alliances couldn\u2019t fully work together because it\u2019s still an individual game and with Eunkyu ready to tank his game to safe Chloe, they knew that one of them would not be safe so they still needed to compete against each other. So it\u2019s hard for the 4 men team to win it all.\n\nEp.6 death match: Yep, it\u2019s clear that math isn\u2019t a strong suit for both of them. They eliminated big numbers like 36, 41 too late by using star to get rid of smaller number like 18, 19 which can also be done by simple operation. Eunkyu spent his exchange cards recklessly caused him big time (pun intended).\n\nI still enjoy watching this week 2 episodes. Ep.2 is still my most favorite followed by Ep.4 though.",

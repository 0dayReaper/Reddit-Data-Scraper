It comes and goes for most, but for some it sticks. Remember when Chris Cornell passed on, a couple months later his close friend Chester left in the same manner.\n\nSometimes, all that is needed is a strong pillar of support one can really count on. But, if that pillar is gone, everything else just feels empty.",

When netizens made her seem like the abusive one because the ex made her look like a crazy person? I was reading the comments on some Naver articles about her death, and it's really disgusting. Some are also saying how it's all the ex-bf's fault for this. Yes, he was a shitbag but it wasn't just him. The hurtful comments also broke her apart. She was unstable. She seemed to work hard to live but I guess it was too difficult for her. I sincerely hope she is at peace now. It's only been a month since Sulli left us, and now another one leaves. I am not a fan of either of them, but it was always so sad to see how much hate these girls got. I can never understand how people can just have so much hatred within them.\n\nedit: My heart is breaking. It really is a dark year.",

What I\u2019m trying to say is there are always 2 sides to everything, When there is love, there will also be hate. I guess the level of tolerance to hate speech and reaction differs greatly between people. Although, we can only speculate, we can never truly understand what is on someone else\u2019s mind. It is truly a sad and heartbreaking news. RIP Hara Goo",

Who knows why, but there's a quite obvious habit amongst people exposed to public criticism (idols, youtubers, whatever) to focus far more upon negative reactions than positive ones.\n\nOn top of that people already suffering from or susceptible to depression amplify negative interactions because they are confirmatory to their own self image. Similarly, they minimize positive interactions, explaining them away as meaningless for whatever reason is most justifiable.\n\nThis is a good part of why the toxic state of internet communication is so dangerous.",

Kudos to them though for keep running and showing some funny/warm side too.\n\nLeePD is too soft, he needs to learn to be a bit more cunning than the members.",

While they are certainly upping their game with the clever narratives, this episode had too many and lengthy rewinded scenes. The overall pace felt slow. The rating drop is understandable. Hope the pds and editors take proper notes and keep the show tight and fast paced.",

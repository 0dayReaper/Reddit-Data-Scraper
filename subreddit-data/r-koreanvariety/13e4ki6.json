There are no dull moments. \n\nHowever, in my opinion, HyeMiLeeYeChaePa is up one notch from Earth Arcade. My reason? PD Na has way too much screen time. It's funny that they get to argue with the PD but sometimes it's just  excessive. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

            "comment": "&gt;PD Na has way too much screen time\n\nYou would appreciate it more if you were familiar with how he does things in his shows; him getting more screen time means these casts are way too energetic and need more explanation on how things are going. You know how often Youngji asked for more games while the show was designed to give 2-3x fewer games than that, and they decided to agree to it and make mini-games on the spot (that's not easy stuff btw). I am sure if they aren't limiting the episode, it would be more than 20 episodes, and mainly it consists of the cast arguing with the PD team for more games (as they think they have so much free time or just can't stand being idle). It's fun but uncontrollable chaos for him and the PD team to the point that they (might) feel overworked, while usually, it's the opposite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, it's kinda unfair to compare both as the dynamics are different.",

Its either you haven't watched PD Na's works that much or you've only watch variety shows where the PDs seldom/never show themselves. Then again, I am me and you are you, so its okay.",

I think this is why Na PD has become so minimalistic in his current shows because Na PD is more focused on capturing and telling the stories of the cast when they are \u201coff camera\u201d. He spends more effort in the editing instead of trying to build elaborate challenges and games. \n\nThese shows often try to have the cast compete against eachother but its just so much more fun when its Cast vs Crew, because they can get properly competitive with punishments and rewards. So when the cast succeeds, the crew now has a challenge to make the next task even harder.",

That speaks volume on his confidence in his team's ability to 1. Come up with a new production plan on the spot and 2. Edit to maximal entertainment value no matter what's happening on screen.",

Imo the flow is better on a show based on a 10 day trip vs one that's held across 6 different weekends. \n\nEA also has more emotional or vulnerable moments than HMLYCP. Yunjin trying to get some sleep during breaks due to her crazy schedule, Mimi needing to find the right place to do yoga in the morning, the late night cafe scene where Yunjin talks about her worries about group chemistry, the night of star gazing at the beach where Youngji writes lyrics. \n\nHow HMLYCP is edited makes it a fun show for sure but those little moments of vulnerability and introspection that Na PD et al capture is what makes EA the more memorable show for me.\n\nBut really both shows are awesome. Can't really go wrong with either one. It's sort of like you're craving sweets and you have cookies and brownies on hand. Why choose when you can have both? And for 2 weeks we will thankfully be having both!",

            "comment": "I think the critical difference is\n\n1. HMYLCP badly needs someone like Eunji.  It's hard to tell at first, but almost every laughing moment in EA is being set up by Eunji.  What may have fallen flat or kinda mid is boosted up and amplified by Eunji, who is the true MVP of the show.\n\nFor example, the hilarious \"This kid's eyes have gone crazy\" Ssam moment in Ep 11 wouldn't be funny if Eunji didn't set herself up to get teased by Yujin (who was obviously planning to eat the Ssam herself after teasing Eunji).  Even the punchline, \"This kid's eyes have gone crazy\", was constructed and delivered perfectly [by Eunji](https://youtube.com/shorts/mSxEAKLd_YE?feature=share).\n\nBut perhaps more importantly...\n\n2. HMYLCP production/editing is, for a lack of better word, fucking terrible - to the point where I feel really bad for the cast (who, frankly, are carrying the show all by themselves in spite of the production crew).  There are sooooooooooo many moments in the show that would have been amazing that the production/editing just let it fall flat on its face.  They only build up shitty narratives that the PDs think are funny/important, while the amazing, natural narratives and moments (that are constantly generated by the amazing chemistry between the casts) are either ignored, allowed to fall flat, or just presented quickly before moving on.\n\nEarly example is when Yena mentions that Hyeri bought her BBQ when they met before, and Hyeri going \"Yena, you're supposed to say that in *front* of the camera\".  Put that moment in the hands of a competent editing crew, that would have been a \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 moment.  With this production?  They just replay it flatly and move on to the games.\n\nThe only reason HMYLCP is gaining traction is because the cast are doing a fantastic job.  That production crew doesn't deserve any accolades the show may receive in the future.",

People forget how much the mafia game took up the entire episode, which basically means, imo, there was probably not much really going on so no footage was deemed usable for the production/editing team.\n\nI do think, imo, that the PD relied on Hyeri alot more to be the \"Eunji\" in the group, which is lol because Hyeri is an idol and not a comedian. Comedians have the basic skill that is needed to make a variety shows in similar nature to work, which is reading the room and doing the appropriate response (reaction, tiki taka, etc). 1n2d has LSG, Kim Junho, Moon Seyoon. No Math School Trip has Lee Youngjin. Earth Arcade has Eunji. Family Outing has YJS. Invincible Youthe has Kim Shinyoung.",

But like you said, she's not a comedian... and she never had to be in the \"Point Guard\" (basketball position, if you're not familiar) role before despite her fairly impressive variety resume.  \n\nI think another problem is that the PD is too used to the in-studio game show format to try and do one of these Na PD-style variety shows.  They're in the outskirts of Choonchun, Gangwon province, but 95% of the show is just inside the guest house + the tent that they use.  If they just chose an apartment in the middle of Seoul, there would be no meaningful difference - and that's a problem.",

We have yet to see but with HMLYCP, the concept will get old after season 2 similar to sixth sense, unless they introduce new twists about the house decoration stuff. \n\n\nIMO they should go to a 3 meals a day style of location next time, just plant veggies and have chickens and an empty house and have the girls survive on that and decorate the house to have more organic interactions/experiences cos honestly the repetitive games will lose steam soon. Inversely, they can have them live in an empty penthouse and give basic stuff that they can upgrade. Variety of guests will be a fresh way to do it too.",

            "comment": "I mean I would give the same reason as you but as to why I enjoy Earth Arcade more. In the end both shows are quite similar, I think PD Na has some slightly better games overall, the no talking in English while going to restaurants for instance is a lot more fun than just playing some other variant of a game where you land on an arithmetic sign and lose or win points. The music games are pretty much exactly the same and the best games on both shows.\n\nI would say for me :\n\n* Earth Arcade games &gt; HyeMiLee games\n* Na PD interactions with cast &gt; HyeMiLee PD with mostly Hyeri (I like both PDs don't get me wrong)\n* Earth Arcade Cast &lt;= HyeMiLeeChaePa. This one is very close though.\n\nSo overall slight edge to Earth Arcade but love both shows. I really think the biggest difference is the game quality in Earth Arcade being better.",

And now their variety shows are getting compared too (dont worry, you're not the first one. I saw this on twitter already)\n\nCmon man I just want to happily consume post-izone content without the fanwars",

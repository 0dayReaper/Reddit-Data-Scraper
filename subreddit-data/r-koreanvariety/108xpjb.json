    "title": "[Transit Love 2 After-show] What do you think Gyumin felt watching the episodes, especially the early ones, and knowing the ending?",

    "postText": "Haeeun seemed like she got her closure through the show. I think she was longing for the relationship and \u2018her boyfriend\u2019 Gyumin, not necessarily the present Gyumin, when she entered the house. But as days passed, she realized those two were long gone. So she was able to move forward quite easily after that realization. After all, what Haeeun really needed was closure rather than Gyumin himself. Him brutally avoiding her actually helped in reaching this conclusion. Because otherwise, she would still have the hope that there\u2019s still second chance on them. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case with Gyumin. For me, he was avoiding her due to the fear his feelings for her would blossom again. In interviews, he always said that \u2018he\u2019s doing that for her\u2019. But isn\u2019t it easier to just tell her that they\u2019re totally over? Also, why would you join the show with her if you genuinely want your ex to forget about you? Hence, I think he missed her, too. But their first relationship/breakup was too painful for him that even though he wanted to jump into the fire again, he lacked the courage to do so. So he created that excuse to convince himself that he was doing the right thing with a good cause. He also used Nayeon to further convince himself he was on the right track, and to distract himself from the lingering desires to connect with Haeeun again as well. \n\nThen the ex date came, he had no choice but to connect with her. I bet he was surprised that he was able to do that so naturally. That had little sparks within him. The things he thought he already buried were still in him subconsciously. Thus, he cried so much because he realized he was not completely healed at all and was just deceiving himself. \n\nHe chose Nayeon in the final decision for the sake of being true to his image within the show. But I don\u2019t think he truly wanted her in the end. On his last appearance, I didn\u2019t see the Gyumin who enjoys Nayeon\u2019s company. If there\u2019s a option to choose nobody, he would probably have done that. \n\nI intended to ask but I ended up pouring my thoughts hahaha anyways. \n\nNow, Haeeun seems to be very happy. While Gyumin seems to be slightly avoiding the spotlight. How do you think he feels after watching the show and seeing the audience\u2019s reactions? I mean he didn\u2019t see those interviews of Haeeun during their stay in the house. Also, he knew she was crying everyday but he didn\u2019t actually witness every moment of it. So how do you think the show\u2019s episodes affected him? Finally, what do you think could have had happened if their stay was extended for another week?",

She got over wanting to get back with him in just a few days once someone else showed her interest (which she had every right to ofc).\n\nI don't believe what she felt for him was true love. True love isn't selfish and petty (e.g. her lying to other girls in anyonymous chats)\n\nPlus wow the final discussion in the car. She had made up her mind well before then (taking off the necklace) but dragged on that convo, guiltripping him over and over again \" you are the worst\" blah blah.  \n\nPoor GM, he did his best in the house to keep distance between him &amp; HE when he knew he didn't wanna get back w her. Imo that's the correct thing to do...can you imagine how even more obsessive she would have acted if he had been friendlier?\n\nI don't get the hype behind HE at all. was rooting for her to move tf on and get on with her life, so I'm glad she seems happy w HG but GM was not the bad guy in the situation.",

I believe he should ve gotten the MVP award for trying his hardest to get HE to move on, even deciding on taking the fall as the bad guy by being stoic. HE made the experience very painful for him and also the viewers with her constant tears. I understand she couldn't control her emotions, but it made everything hard to watch.\n\n I honestly believe that GM knew HE best after dating her for 7 years, so he knew the only way to handle this scenario was to act cool even though he still felt a lot for her. I dont understand why there has to be a villain in this story. GM is definitely not the villain. He brought her on the show and helped her to his own detriment to move on. I wish them both the very best.",

He is an ENTJ, they don't care about hurting others feelings as long as what they do is the right desicion. He did this show to become famous. He said that to avoid criticism. It backfired cause he was harsh. He doesn't understand feelings. He isn't a mean sob, he just lost his chance. The only thing he'll be thinking about after this show is that knetz and perhaps inetz are dumb and bullies. He will feel that he was unfairly judged and evil-edited. Cause ENTJ has huge ego and will judge that everyone else is at fault cause they don't think feelings are important. They really can hurt themselves bad when they care about thier \"objective\" facts before the \"loser\" feelers. I think he will become secluded at first and then move on as nothing happend. If anyone gets close to him and discuss about it he will just complain that the show or Haeeun was manipulative and blaime others. This is not a personality that tend to self-reflect. This is a personality that doesn't give a damn unless it's hurting his ego or plans.",

Alot of his action were just cold towards her. While this did help her to eventually move on , I genuinely don't think it was kind. The biggest indicator was when HE was finally happy and starting to move on, there was him getting jealous because he received less validation. Even if he felt that,he should not have bought it up at all to confuse her.\nThis is where I question how considerate he actually was of her.\nIn the end if the day I believe he never had any feelings left for her and all his actions where self motivated.",

Ofc it's different if she choose to leave on her own, but not with \"pushing to resign\".\n\nBut after all these year, are they (people from production staff atleast writer or YJS) really not try to talk to SJH it's something I'm curious about. \n\nStill Runningman now is Runningman because the member who been together for decade and I love that then I don't really want somebody to leave again. \n\nSome other show can still striving after changing the member, but some show just straight to road of destruction after changing the member.

Probably since his role gonna overlapped with kang ho dong which the board want him to join running man.\n\nAnd u know what happen, massive anger from audience, especially international one until they need to apologize and members decide to just end the show on feb 2017. March 2017, the team decided to continue the show with 2 new casting. Anyway even back then, its impossible for SBS to remove jihyo. The only way for it to happen is voluntarily dimissal like gary and kwang soo. \n\nTalking about jihyo i think members already give up to get her old cheerful side. 2-3 years ago jaesuk and suk jin keep helping jihyo getting screentime and asking her to participate more, but i rarely seen it now. Even for the past year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. She never good at talking, even in early running man time, jihyo always act as a side character. Her main role is always a loveline with gary, love hate relationship with kjk, fighting with kwangsoo + other members. Early days mission is always a physical game which she's good at, since 2015 they become more invested in talking rather than playing since the members are getting old.\n2. Running man from 2010 - 2016, she is the centre of attention due to her being only female, so every single screentime and members attention will only go to her. Somin join the cast create a huge contrast between them, she is freaking humorous, so good at talking and witty. She know how to control the situation well, create scenes, lead a conversation, so most of screentime always go to her. \n3. Gary leaving made the worst of all since she lose a good connection in the program. Until then LKS is the one who always lead her to participate, but as i said jeon so min presence is just that good. Another reason why she had so many haters in early of her time (mostly from jihyo fans). And we all know LKS left the show in 2021 made it worst.\n4. In conclusion, she is just not that good in talk-variety.",

Backlash is normal after all from the fans of respective figure. \n\nI mean from what I see and what I read, she sure improve a lot from the past but the problem is she not making an impact regularly in 1 eps. \n\nIf I'm not wrong in some \"large number cast variety show\", there always such a case where compare to other member, they rarely get screen time but when they talking they make 1-3 impact per episode and it's can be considered as work done. . \n\nI mean people who can't singing can improve to some extent level if they try and learn, what about decade worth of time. But since they only editing the entertaining part, I just hope that at least she's trying and participate actively in talking but it's just it's not entertaining so it's doesn't get out to viewer. \n\nWhat's worst than having a bad season? It's not even trying after all. Ah, I just recently start watching over a famous show and I found the new enlightenment on the cast that people find annoying and don't like it, they atleast working hard and even have more impact on the show although it's not much.

So it wouldn't be any different. She isn't actively hurting the show. My point is that she is occupying a space that can and should be used a lot better. An unnie-donseang dynamic with SoMin can be fun and cute. (Lee Da Hee, Jin Seo Yeon, Oh Na Ra, Kim Shin Rok, etc) a woman closer in age to the men so she is a peer to them at the very least is a new dynamic (She's the same age as YJS's wife, only 2 years younger than Haha and closer in age to Jongkook than to YSC). They usually have very young female guests. So that dynamic we see many other places as well as RM when those guests are around. So it's important and new to have that on the cast. \n\nShe holds a great spot - she's just not doing anything with it. So, yes, I'm all for replacing her if it means someone else who can do those things is joining. If SJH stays and that person is added, that's fine too. But don't just get rid of her and that's that. That won't solve anything.",

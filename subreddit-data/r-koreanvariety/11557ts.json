I noticed both are no longer available on Viki but may be on Kocowa subscription? I know I watched Tteokbokki Brothers on Viki so I'm not sure when it left or why but I think I saw there was a new season. \n\nCan anyone confirm if Kocowa has older Home Alone and/ Tteokbokki Brothers available to stream in US?\n\nThank you!",

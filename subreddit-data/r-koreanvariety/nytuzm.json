I think he's the 2nd most important member for the show, after YJS. And I do worry if the show can survive without him. I just dislike the character he's developed / been shoehorned into for the show.\n\nGo watch the show from the beginning, and you'll see him trying different roles to find his place in the show. Til one day he fought back against all the grief he got (especially from KJK) as the youngest and omega. And that gradually morphed into his current persona as the downtrodden betrayer. While enormously successful (and easily relatable by the masses who feel they've unfairly been dealt a bad hand in life), everything I read outside of the show says that's not really him. That he's a really nice guy who will bend over backwards to help you.\n\nSo in that respect I think leaving is a good move for him. Gives him a chance to try to grow beyond the RM stereotypes which largely define him in most people's minds. Who knows, maybe he can come back to the show later, reshaped into a new, more mature character who isn't as annoying. (Like HaHa did after he got married. His childish playboy persona up til then was just cringeworthy awful, making him my least-favorite in the early years of the show.)\n\nAnd he still hasn't given YJS that slap to the forehead they agreed to a couple years ago!  He needs to come back for that.",

Jae seok and Kwang Soo were there for me during the times I felt most lost, and even now.\n\nIt's crazy, but somewhere along the way, I started thinking--no matter what happens, I'll always have Running Man to comfort me on Mondays, and Kwang Soo was a big, big part of that.\n\nHe may not seem like it because he's a cunning, mischievous liar, but imo Kwang Soo was, is, and will be a great role model. This is a guy who's known to be incredibly kind and caring in real life, making sure his noonas and hyeongs are taken care of and that his dongsaengs feel at ease. He's shown time and time again how humble he is and he never, ever gives than 100% on shoot day. He always gave it all and made it his goal to make viewers laugh even if he had an image as an actor.\n\nHe was always teased for being second-fiddle to his actor friends, but Kwang Soo hyeong...I hope you know that you made me smile and laugh and dream way more than any of those actors. You're chasing new dreams now and I don't do this for anyone, but I'll watch all your shows and movies (ok maybe not the one where you're a fish).\n\nThank you. Thank you for carrying the show when it was rocky, thank you for setting an example on how to be a great, memorable person. Thank you for making me happy.

Hell first rain came in as soon as the intro started with Kwang Soo talking about what he wanted to do.\n\nI'll try to talk about the episode here. Bo Pil did an *amazing* job at keeping the show on rails and dedicating the race to Kwang Soo. The hidden race for Kwang Soo was kind of the perfect way to send out the episode. I'm fairly sure the photographer was gonna fudge the shots to get it to tie for first, but the thought behind the idea was still a home run. Top to bottom, expertly crafted and gave Kwang Soo a perfect send off.",

One thing lead to another and I started watching Running Man, it might be one of my first kvariety shows. \n\nI was laughing so hard! I loved the chemistry, their banter, their missions, everything. But I laughed so hard when LKS was on the screen. That 1+ hour of the show made me forget everything around me. I not only watched the current episodes but also started to watch old ones. \n\nI wanted to watch the episodes where LKS won, wishing him to have a great ending. But, as everyone knows, those are very rare. I used to think what\u2019s up with the mad gambles and goofs. Then slowly I understood, he plays his character till the end. He only cared for the entertainment, keeping things interesting for the viewers. For that LKS became this conniving, greedy, sly character which is far from his real life.\n\nAlways loved him as an actor, but I admired his dedication on the Running Man. I was so emotional at the end of episode 558, didn\u2019t even notice when the tears started to drop. It\u2019s kinda silly to get attached to a variety show, but LKS being on RM is one of the things I really enjoy. \n\nI like to think he started to grow his beard and moustache again as a way to link to the early years of RM. I will of course continue watching RM, I still love everyone and everything about it (it sure has its ups and downs like any other show). LKS was sure a big part of it though, I will always miss him being a part of the team. This random fan hopes he finds success in everything he works in.",

I haven't been a passionate follower of Running Man this past few years, i would watch it ocasionally, but Kwang Soo's leaving really hit me through this episode. It made me remember when i was in a very bad place mentally and very depressed around 2013 and how seeing RM every week was helping me, healing me without me even realizing. My favourite member was Kwang Soo, i really felt identified with his personality, humor, i laughed the most with his jokes and it really hurts knowing that i'm not going to see him anymore with the rest of the cast. Thinking about all the memories he made with the members, the relationships they developed, how he gave everything he had for us, to make us smile...it hurts thinking about it. Makes me feel empty somehow even tho it's just a character from a tv-show that i watch through a screen. Anyways, i loved seeing this story develop through the years and i'm thankful for everything they have given us and for being part of this as a viewer. Thank you, Kwang Soo, thank you and i hope you'll be happy wherever life takes you! Bon voyage.",

It'll bring peace of mind to him that he just needs to focus on one industry and he can throw himself into acting, which is his primary dream. I hope he doesn't feel like he has to do anything outstanding. Just focus on acting and his personal life and his mental and physical health.",

The members grew and so did we, the viewers who have been watching since the beginning. 3991 days.. This episode not only marked the end of LKS's journey as a RM member, but it also signified how far this programme has came along, and a reminder of how our lives has changed throughout the same period. \n\nThis episode beautifully wrapped up LKS's journey on RM, with the right amount of fun and feels. I bawled when they mentioned \"You can stop running and start walking now\". \n\nThe show was right in saying that LKS was a childhood memory to viewers.

                    "comment": "Probably not happening. Why would they?\n\nPeople seem to forget that this is first and foremost a job that pays well for most of the members. JSJ, YJS, YSC, Haha, and KJK are all variety entertainers and variety shows are their primary income. Yes even for KJK who does way more variety than music nowadays. Most adults don't suddenly quit their job because their favorite coworker of 10 yrs left to pursue another job at another company. RM is like a stable income for them. They wouldn't quit unless there's an actual good reason such as a serious injury (which shouldn't be a problem anymore because the show barely has any physical activity left. They don't even wear their nametags anymore.) or one of them wants to semi-retire and spend more time with their family because they have earned enough money.\n\nI don't think Somin would quit either because she just bought a new apartment and her acting career isn't that great. She might leave in 1-2 yrs though after saving enough. The only one I realistically see quitting is SJH because she has made so much money over the past decade thanks to RM boosting her popularity to international level and she doesn't really seem to enjoy being on RM (not as much as the other members.) The new show format is just not her strength and she's an actress to begin with.\n\nThe reason why LKS, Gary, and even Joongki left was because they really wanted to pursue their actual dream of being a successful actor (joongki and LKS) / musician for gary. Throughout the past 10 yrs, we could see LKS's passion for acting, and having his Monday and/or Tuesday blocked off probably hindered his opportunities, especially since he's not that popular (B-tier actor), unlike SJH who is a lead actress (A-tier). It's too much of an inconvenience for the casting team. \n\nPeople would reply to me that LKS quit because of his injury and not because he wants to focus on acting, but I disagree. It's more the latter than the former. Like I said, the show barely has any strenuous physical activity left. Have you watched last episode? YJS riding on LKS's back and ordering him to lift that palanquin just to make it funny. If LKS's injury was the real reason, YJS wouldn't do that as it would absolutely further damage his injury. YJS isn't dumb and knows his priorities. Haha also injured his back and you can see that the crew is making accommodations for him, but they aren't for LKS and I doubt it is because of favouritism. And before someone tells me I don't know shit about ankle injuries, I'm a medical doctor by profession. It's also obvious why they used his ankle injury as the reason for why he quit the show. It's MUCH easier for fans to accept this as the real than \"sorry guys im leaving the show because I wanna do something else\" That's why I think even when LKS fully heals his ankle, he isn't coming back. I don't blame him. I'm sure it was a VERY hard decision for him and it definitely makes him sad to quit the show that made him who he is.\n\nMaybe because I am probably older than most people on this sub, but I have a more pragmatic view on this situation.",

Why do you think so?\n\nFrom what I know, SJH is the lead actress of many movies and dramas, but the viewership count isn't that high for them so I don't put her in the S-tier list like Jun Ji hyun or Song Hye Kyo for example. \n\nWhereas Kwangsoo has been the male lead in only 2? (The cops drama and the mini series Sound of your Heart). The crew sometimes jokes that he's always only a supporting actor or a cameo, which is true. The only popular movie he starred a significant role in is Tazza. But I think he has a few movies lined up this year or next year so I do see Kwangsoo becoming A-tier eventually.\n\nEdit : I stand corrected. LKS is closer to A-tier than SJH.",

Otherwise it's no different from what Koreaboo/Allkpop/Soompi do: spreading rumors for drama &amp; sensationalism.\n\nI'm sure the other members were confused about the entire situation so the entertainment director visiting them along with KJK and letting them know about future plans was helpful. But it doesn't seem that there was any \"convincing\" or \"persuading\" needed as there's no evidence the other members were planning on dropping out collectively.\n\nEdit: in response to your edit, um I'm not downvoting you. I just want a Korean news article that backs up what you're claiming. If your only source is a weakly translated article with a broken link from a site known for mistranslating and misinterpreting news for the sake of getting more clicks, then idk what to tell you.\n\nAnd lbr if you had actual reliable proof that all the members planned to drop out together you would have thrown it in my face immediately.

And there's not a single reliable article that backs up your claim that the members were going to all collectively drop out nor that they needed any persuasion to return.\n\nThe only reason I asked you to provide a Korean source is to give you a chance to provide some evidence yourself or perhaps refer something I may have missed. Even the Soompi article you posted doesn't have a link to a Korean source. You may as well write your own article on Soompi and attach that as proof.\n\nOn a side note, it's not a problem if you mistakenly believed unconfirmed rumors. It's okay to be confused. But it can be problematic if you're trying to pass rumors on to other people as facts. For future reference. Peace.",

It felt like the show had unfinished business with Gary, and that he quit halfway.\n\nBut maybe because I went through the same changes in life stage and age as LKS, and when I look back at how many changes in job, in relationships, and in everything else I've been through in the past 11 years, I feel that LKS has accomplished and given everything that he possibly can to the show and more (and to be fair, Running Man has given him a lot too). I'm sad that he's leaving because he has been one of my favourite characters in the past few years, but I'm glad for him that he can move on to the next phase of his life and career.\n\nCan you imagine starting out as a 26 year old with lots more to see and discover and learn and achieve in the world; and end up staying at a single job for 11 years? Where I am now as a 37 year old, I simply can't.\n\nSo I respect LKS and the 11 years of his youth that he's giving to RM, and I wish him all the best. Thank you for your resilience, your professionalism, and the countless hours of entertainment you have brought into my life.\n\nNow, go try something else!",

The main attraction for me to Running man was for the fun and excitement each episode brought specially from the \"Animals\" of the group,(Tiger, Grasshoppers, Giraffe, etc), and when one of them leaves it just feels like a huge void. Honestly, I would've thought of the OG cast, the next member that would leave would've been JSJ(something teased this episode ) but he seems as energetic as usual. Because of the difference, it seems between his and Gary's departure, it will open the opportunity for LKS to \"guest\" on the show in the future.\n\nBest of Luck to LKS career and will definitely be supporting his next drama/ movie.\n\nRating wise I know the show hasn't been as popular as in year past like double digit ratings but does anyone know if the current ratings are still \"decent\" for the show?",

Arguably, KS's character has shown the most growth, from feel-chok-cross to copycat of his famous friends to Prince of Asia to betrayer, etc. What I appreciate the most about KS is he always goes above and beyond, always give 200% every single episode.\n\nThank you KS for the memories. Can't believe it's been 11 years. Seems like it was yesterday when you were introducing yourself for the first time in episode 1 of RM in the rain. You've brought so much laughter to RM fans, to me, and RM was extremely lucky to have casted you as a member. IMO, no one can replace you because you are one of a kind, Prince of Asia!!!",

I'm so thankful for Kwang Soo for being a big part of my weekly dose of happiness for the past 7 years of me watching this show. I'll start catching up with the episodes that have happened since this one, with the mindset of looking forward to the future :')",

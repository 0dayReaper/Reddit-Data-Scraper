    "postText": "16 players have been chosen. Episode 88 showed us the determination of AJH in defeating the\n strongest Soccer team around Korea regions. 16 locked in but without the presence of Kim Jun Ho, Jo Won Woo and Kim Yong Sik(they hv training/competition), there is a possibility that the number of starters may increase or the chosen players being replace.\n\n3 players lost their spot but there's always a chance for them to come back, said AJH. With more training he believes that one day, they might have a chance again. Now, from my understanding, they will be a backup player as you know we do have quite lots of active athletes and sport coaches. \n\nFor Title Match Tour, they will have 1 month worth of training before re-taking the Title Match in the lost Soccer matches of Jeolla-do, Gyeongsang-do and Jeju.\n\nDate as below (Stadium Schedule);\nJeolla-do- 19 April 2023\nGyeongsang-do- 26 April 2023\nJeju - 3 May 2023\n\nSo, basically, 3 weeks straight of Title Matches. Let's pray for their success \ud83d\ude4f \n\nSeoul will be the last region on the list. (Date Unknown)\n\nSURPRISE! SURPRISE! SUPRISE!\nK-nets prediction (and probably us International fans) is wrong!\nI can't believe it when AJH left this one player out of the starter's.\n\nPrediction of players that will leave the team;\n-Lee Jang Kun\n-Mo Tae Bum\n-Kim Tae Sul\n-Lee Hyung Taik\n\nAJH'  Final Decision;\n-Lee Jang Kun\n-Lee Hyung Taik\n -Kim Jun Hyeon\n\nAfter watching the match, I can see Mo Tae Bum and Kim Tae Sul improvement and confidence. I hope they will maintain their performance. Lee Jang Kun, on the other hand, lost his touch and confident like everything went up to smokes a long time ago. He got indirectly roasted by AJH btw . 'I know some players skip training and it shows' something like that.  For Kim Jun Hyeon, I can't really pinpoint what his problem was, but I got the feeling that AJH sort of fed up with his performance. I'm not sure why. And Lee Hyung Taik? I think everyone expected it from the start tbh\ud83d\ude05\n\nQuestion Time!\nWill Eojjeoda Avengers overcome the obstacles and push their limit to become the strongest amateur soccer team in Korea? Or will they abandon their dreams and leave us in the dark corner of our room thinking about what show to watch to feed our binging addiction?\n\nVote! Vote! Vote!\n\n\n(P.S. Yall better convert your family, friends, exes, bosses, neighbours, and pets to watch Let's Play Soccer. We are a cult now. Bye)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/12pl4ii)",

            "comment": "It's pretty obvious that Hyung-Taik and Jang-Kun are gonna be cut as soon as they announced that they're removing players. They're the absolute worst at their positions. Hyung-Taik is too old and slow to play at this level. The problem with Jang-Kun is his reluctance to play as a defender and his misplaced belief about his scoring ability. 88 episodes in and he's still a one-footed football player. I think if he stayed at CB with his speed and tussling ability, he'd still be in the show. \n\n  \nJun-Hyeon on the other hand has been scolded by Manager AJH a few episodes before the auditions. AJH said his form has been off for quite some time, and as soon as the coaches and the manager said that one of the priority positions is the wing back, I knew he was on the chopping block, cuz they weren't gonna cut Min-Ho, he's a fan favorite, both Coach Won-Hee and LDG are defending him and the only reason his form is on the downturn is cuz AJH kept putting him at RWB instead of any midfield position which is where he plays the best. \n\nAnd another thing that AJH kept scolding Jun-Hyeon about; is his habit to dribble up the middle, when he's supposed to play on the wings. He turns the ball over about 50% of the time whenever he dribbles up the middle and it narrows the field of play for the Avengers. As soon as I saw Jun-Hyeon dribble the ball up the middle in this game, I knew he won't be coming back. He had plenty of time to shake off that habit and focus on dribbling up the wings, but he chose to ignore AJH's instructions.",

            "comment": "I actually think the roster choices made perfect sense. To be blunt they were the ones who had plenty of time but showed either a significant slowing in their progressing as soccer players or came to a complete halt. Jang Kun had simply stopped developing. His ball control and spatial awareness were becoming serious issues as the team developed around him. It simply became too glaringly evident.  Hyung Taik was the oldest and it was starting to show in certain instances, but also, throughout the series he was also the person who tried to get by with the least effort in their conditioning and training sessions. When you get older you actually have to put in MORE effort than younger players in order to keep pace with their improvement. In the end, father time simply won out. Kim Jun Hyeon was similar to Jang Kun. His ball handling was starting to become a problem.  He still gave effort and was fast, but he had started to stall out in improvement, and it was becoming more difficult to find a place to put him on the field. Honestly,  those three were definitely the three who needed replaced, performance wise. \n\nI genuinely think they are starting to put together a nasty (in a good way) roster that hopefully will keep improving in their skills and understanding of the game. They have the potential to be the best amateur team, if they can get a bit more precision and cohesion as a team. The physical capabilites are there.",

                    "comment": "Another problem with Jang-Kun is that until now he still cannot receive a lob pass/cross. He's become a liability in the last 10 or so matches and the main thing that AJH was scolding  him about is that he waits for the ball to come to him near the middle of the field, rather than do preemptive runs up the left wing and attack from there. \n\nHe plays like a left striker, rather than a left winger, and because his right foot has not improved in the 88 episodes he's in, and all opposing teams know how to stop him, he's pretty much a non-factor in their offense.\n\nI still believe he could have stayed on the show if he just kept playing as a defender. But he wanted to stand out and instead got cut from the team. He could have stood out as a CB, I mean, the best personalities and fan favorites on the show aren't even the two main strikers.  The Kyu-Gyoo duo may be their best overall  players, but Min-Ho, Chil-ku, Andre, Dae-Hoon, Tae-Bum and Dong-Hyun add so much life and levity to the show.",

He's definitely shown improvement but Junhyeon wouldve been the better choice if you're point out ball handling as an issue. He also make better cut through passes up &amp; crosses to the GyuGyu line.\n\nDon't get me wrong I like Taebum but if we're looking at who would be more beneficial from a football/soccer team perspective Junhyeon would be the better choice from my perspective especially if they moved him up the line instead of getting sidelined to RWB.",

But to your point I think Taebum is better at field positioning.  In fact, the coaches were using him this last game against the women's team to explain where to be to one of the new players.  I think his soccer IQ is better even if Hyeon is physically more gifted. That said, Taebum won't be on the roster for the next game and Hyeon will.  AJH is trying out all kinds of combinations. It's too early to figure out who will or will not be on the roster week to week. This may be their new format where they always leave certain players out every week.  Make it seem like it's a competition for the spots, but really it's coaches' decision each week, and it probably coincides with their non-soccer schedules as well. \n\nI wouldn't get too worried one way or another if a favorite player gets the boot one week because they will probably just bring them back in a week or two.",

They've both improved on it though but yeah from memory - Junhyeon preferred position was the attacking winger.\n\nRecent episodes have been abit lackluster so I guess the PD's are trying to spice things up abit to create some drama.",

It seems like the winter ki d of shut down a lot of amateur soccer so they had to figure out how to fill time and then Rev the show back up into competition form. \n\nI am interested to see who actually ends up on the starting 11 when they start playing games that really count again. I think that is when we will know what AJH is planning and who he genuinely thinks should be on the roster in order to win. Their formation has been different every game so far as well, so I am sure the active roster spots will coincide with the type of formation is chosen per game. I too have deepened my knowledge of the sport through this show.  I watched it, bit for some reason really got interested on a deeper level after watching this show.\n\nI appreciate the good conversation! I look forward to more of the same in the future!",

With a 16 man roster and without Jun-Ho and Won-Woo, their starting RW and LWB, I'm not optimistic about their chances. They had a month to prepare, but a lot of the players are newbies, and they're pitting them against teams who already know how their best players play.  \nThat'll be like their matches against Su-FC, they lost by Penalty Shootout in their first match and got beat 2-1 in the rematch, and Su-FC's best player sat out the 1st half and that was the only reason.\n\nIf they play against, Jeolla-AP FC again, I don't think the result will be any different than before.",

                    "comment": "I think it will be up to the coaches now to upgrade the players' skills training and strengthen their basic skills? And maybe throw in some new set piece or attacking plan. From the look of the Ep 89 trailer, they will learn an offside trap used by Kim Byung Ji's team in Ep38. A few of them still make mistakes in passing ball or crossing to the side, tho.\n\n\nEven tho the opposite team already knows about Kyu-Gyu Line abilities, it will depend on the coaches smart plan on how to put other players in action. I mean, if you focus too much on the MCs, you will often overlook other potential players. \n\nIf all soccer teams that exist change their players every time their plays got exposed, it speaks incompetence on the coaches side. \n\nWe only look at players' performance before. But I think its time for the coaches to step up their game, too. That same old trick won't work again unless they put a twist on their game plan to outsmart their opponent.\n\nKyu-Gyu Force is still one of the strong combo to me. \nJust dont forget other potential players that we have that definitely can shake up the scene if we use them right.",

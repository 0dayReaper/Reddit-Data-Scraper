    "postText": "I\u2019ve been looking for this episode for years now. I watched it as a kid and remember enjoying it quite a bit. If anyone knows the exact episode it is, that would be incredibly amazing.. From what i remember, they were all stuck in a room and they discussed what each person\u2019s bad habit was (with that person not being able to hear the group discussion or knowing what their habit was). I remember some of the bad habits were like one person would start eating and another would start sweating easily. If they did the actions that were given to them, they would be eliminated. I remember it being kinda spooky and they used bobbleheads to signify who was out and who was still in. Don\u2019t really expect anyone to know the exact episode from the top of their head and trust me, I\u2019ve been searching far and wide and endlessly all over the internet trying to find it but have never had any luck. Just posting here as a last resort.. thanks a ton!",

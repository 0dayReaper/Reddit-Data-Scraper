KJM was the MVP this episode - he made a lot of funny moments.  \nMaybe I didn't mind the rematch because the situation allowed NIW to finally sleep indoors. I was so happy for him. But maybe DD could've seen it that way and should have kept his cool better. I still liked that they had a rematch and it was between him and KJM. \n\nGlad they sorted things out - but this is the reality of variety shows. Sometimes real emotions come out and we're familiar that DD tend to lose professionalism when other members cheat. I would feel frustrated if I were in his shoes.",

I know some people will say that if Junho was in Dindin's place, things can be entertaining but no, season 4 members are different, they take their games seriously.

So many things is happening that time that you can't help but not notice that someone is going to snap when you're expecting them react as they usually do for the show. And DD's losing streak may have been frustrating him and all the negativity following him after that football fiasco has been piling up that he let his emotions get the best of him. He said he started realizing he probably reacted over the top when JM said he's doing it for variety (they're both consider themselves comedians sometimes), but he's a stubborn guy and has to go through with it. When he saw JM kneeling and throwing his pride, you can see all the adrenaline and fight leaving him that he started tearing up, knelt and felt bad that he hugged JM. But show must go on and he has to control his emotions. MSY wiping his tears is so me because I was so scared how it would go!",

I'm just glad it ended on the good note. Both of them have good intentions but when you're not on the same page, things can go wrong. Kudos for JM to handle it well - I think he was a bit shocked with DD reactions too, and kudos for DD too to be able to overcome his feelings quickly. Although I'm disagreed on how he kicked JM, but hey, JM can always kick him back later",

            "comment": "God, the rematch was so uncomfortable to watch. I had to fast forward it. I do understand where DD is coming from. Don't get DD wrong. He loved Jongmin a lot and feels the most comfortable in terms of who he can play with. YJH was someone no one wants to disrespect because it can turn uncomfortable when he gets really competitive. And seriously, despite only having a year difference, it does feel like YJH belongs to a different generation (and also social standing). Moon Se Yoon, he can tease and be playful with but he still has the maturity around him. The maknae line, as much as he tries, he can't be too comfy with because they seem wary of him a little bit despite joining with the tease and also, he just becomes a 'hyung' when they're together.\n\nUnfortunately, this time, KJM and DD's mood are in contrast with each other. And seriously, being cheated on when you're over-exerting yourself in physical activity can dampen your mood especially if you're already frustrated as it is. I don't know if anyone has noticed but DD seems a lot more distant than he was before. He can't seem to find his footing in the group and has been prickly a lot. Sometimes I feel like there's a cloud looming above him. He's been going through turbulent times, and I hope he gets over it. He seems very sensitive on what netizens think over him. I don't want him to stop being DD the kid!\n\nI feel like they need to stop doing OB and YB for a while. As much as I love watching OB team be leisure, the maknae line has this thing that does make you feel the generation gap between them (unless you're KJM because the members do feel at ease with him regardless) lmao. Maybe trying for 2-member team, an individual, or doing more 6 man team would help this game (where they all have the same goal and not risk getting separated at the end).\n\n**whoops! long rant! tldr;** I don't blame DD reacting that way. It doesn't change that it was very uncomfortable and could have gone a lot worse but didn't (and DD being able to do it) because it's Jongmin. He will try his best to lighten the mood, kneel and apologize to keep the show going and of course, I'm pretty sure they'll be good and laughing together again. They'll talk it out and then tease each other again. You can actually see DD feeling bad and realizing what happened when KJM kneeled and crawled. And I just felt a relief over me when I saw that ending.",

If they haven't mentioned it multiple times, I'd be surprised to find out that they're only a (barely) year apart. If I can put it in perspective, YJH is kinda like that really nice uncle you see your dad hang out with and you feel that kind of generational gap so you let them adults be (someone you'd be surprised when they show they can be playful sometimes too), while JM was that uncle you want to play with, who would tease you until you probably feel frustrated and who you would get excited to visit, the one you would excitedly jump when they're lying down or asleep just to get their attention. lmao Both JM and JH does carry themselves a lot differently. Atleast I don't feel the blatant disrespect and obvious dislike S4 members have with Jongmin. They may treat both of them differently, but that doesn't mean they don't adore both of them (in a different way and even if its not equally hahah)",

But hes the only one cheating and playing dirty. Its nothing serious, but it gets annoying after a while, hence why we see dindin get pissed (finally)\n\nWhen he blames kjm for sabotaging the jumprope, all the other members agreed thats not cool.",

I am not getting paid so why should I try that hard lol\n\n&gt;Its almost every episode he does some petty shit to win the game\n\nYes, he does. Everyone in variety does. Even the national mc yoo Jae suk does. Heck running man entirely runs with this concept.\n\nTrue variety entertainers aren't competitive, they always play in their own comfortable pace and try to sabotage each other in a fun way to ensure both fun content and their win. \n\nThe important point is that opposite players must have the variety sense to return the fun the sabotage which dindin was clearly missing. \n\nAlso the other members weren't being disapproving, they were just going by the flow to make it dramatic. \n\nGrow up. Not everyone has time or energy to stan celebrities.",

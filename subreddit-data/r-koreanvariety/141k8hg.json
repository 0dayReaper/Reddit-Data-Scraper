            "comment": "Idk if anyone else watches a lot of asian variety tv shows but I do. They are a lot more realistic than regular western reality tv and I find myself much more invested. Its the summer time so I check this google drive that I found here on reddit once a week to see if anything new has been added for me to either binge or watch weekly. Well, to my surprise I check it today and guess what? The brotha deleted the drive and told me to touch grass. Is this a sign of the end or a sign I need to step outside? if possible at all; could a Good Samaritan bless with a different google drive or update this feed with new asian variety tv shows.",

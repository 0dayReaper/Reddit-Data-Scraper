Even without YJS, Hyori and Rain, more than half those idols on that stage probably won't make it big. That's just the fact of the industry. I guess some kpop fans like to blame other artists when their favorites don't win, but we don't need that negativity here lol.",

To me, Somi song sounds a lot like a Disney channel actress first singing debut after becoming legal lol (so much better than birthday though). Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a bop but might not do well too well with the general public. \n\nIn comparison, Beach again is a mix of the past and modern sounds - making it have more of a general appeal!

They had auditions to pick the right song, tried to see which people should join the group and did loads of dance training just to do good performances for the fans.\n\nthe entire project was created because YJS felt like the musical style last summer was too boring and he wanted to inject more fun music to the scene. \n\nBesides, everyone else knew for a month when they'd debut. Why release your song at the same time ?",

The whole thing is a joke for a TV show, the fact that its well done doesn't take away from that, it adds to the joke. Some of you seem to really look down on what it takes to make a good joke. The whole thing is great, but it's at its core a song by a gagman for a variety show.",

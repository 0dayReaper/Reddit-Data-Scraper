While enjoying the amazing food and romantic vibes of Yeosu, the members show off their performances. The locations of the performances are totally random and unexpected as the fan requests are picked randomly.

            "comment": "I find myself really drawn to variety shows where the regular members are all (or most) females - and this one is no exception. I like the balance between seeing their performances and witnessing them just chilling and forming bonds; it's a classic healing show for me.\n\n**Jung Hwa** is such a sweetheart. I was happy to watch her witness the success of her drama premiere (The show itself just ended a week ago with high rating -18.5%)\n\nI feel like **Kim Wan Sun** is still not fully in her element, but I think it's understandable given the fact that most of the other girls have already been together in another show and she wasn't in the spotlight for many years.\n\n**Lee Hyo Ri** is a true leader. I understand why she sometimes might come as intimidating, opinionated and even difficult to work with, but I feel like everything she does comes from a place of genuine and sincere intentions and she seems to truly care for her people (and animals \ud83e\udd0d) I'm surprised with how much of a softer and sensitive side she's showing compare to the past (even on the more recent appearance like Hyori's Homestay, SSAK3  and refund sisters).\n\n**BoA** is a fascinating case. On one hand, for years she's been saying that she hates being treated like *the young one* and on the other hand everything that she does, from the way she carries herself, to her mannerism and even the way she speaks - it all screams 15 years old (even sometimes younger). It's a known fact that after trauma, it's possible to get emotionally stuck at the age it happened (they even briefly talked about it on the show), I think debuting so young did effect her in that sense.\n\nI don't have a lot to say about **Hwasa**, she's just chilling and slaying like expected.\n\nAlso, seeing them slowly gather one by one to watch Jung Hwa's drama, and seeing Lee Hyori sending the younger girls to bed was really wholesome.",

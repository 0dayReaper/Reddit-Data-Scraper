    "postText": "There's something about lying in bed while watching extremely physically fit people accomplish insane things with their body that makes me feel marginally more alive. If you have any recommendations for similar shows, I would love to check them out! I prefer watching people with training (\uac00\uc9dc\uc0ac\ub098\uc774/Toy Soldiers just makes me feel bad for the contestants), but I'm going to check out Real Men too.\n\nETA: While Eng subs are nice, I don't need them! \n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "Well, if you've watched The Soldiers then Iron Squad/Steel Troops 1&amp;2 is right up your alley since they're adjacent (similar batch of soldiers minus the international coaches). Real Men does not have trained soldiers (a lot of them are supposed to be bad to be funny) but there were a few members that were amazing (Navy special w/ Lee Siyoung, a few of the athletic idols and actors were good, Hyeri was good in a funny way, etc.). Note, the Real Man 300 spinoff wasn't as good imo but ymmv. There's not a lot of official tv shows that feature ex/current military veterans so it's mostly all those youtube shows that will get you that fix. As you already know, from what I've seen of the YT shows, they go SUPER HARD as a means of drawing in viewers and cuz they're trying to replicate the actual intense trainings they went through (like Toy Soldiers). \n\nSimilar shows but not exactly featuring veterans and instead having them coach or lead the trainings are usually more educational. For example tvN's I'm a Survivor takes a variety of female celebs and try to instill comradery and let them have fun learning a few things rather than have them properly compete with each other. Again, Siyoung and Minkyung (the comedian/national handgun shooting representative) are there and the coach, Park Eun ha, is a former special forces and is badass.",

I remember watching it at 2am when I was growing up and I was confused as to how these people were not dead. \n\nNothing will get your heart pumping more when you realise people got serious injuries on that show like concussions and cracked ribs.",

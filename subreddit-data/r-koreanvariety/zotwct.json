    "postText": "After finishing Transit Love/EXchange (both seasons) i wanted to watch another korean dating show..  \n\nI started Heart Signal korean version season 2 (because that's the one that was recommended most), and just with the first episode i can say that is pretty much the same as 'Transit love'.\n\nThe only difference is that Transit Love is about exes and new people and you can say straight away if you like someone, and Heart Signal is about only new people (no one knows each other) and you can't say directly if you like someone (you need to give signals that you like that person, that's why is called 'Heart Signal')\n\nThey send messages to each other anonymously the same as Transit love, they live in a house together the same, new participants will be added, they will go on dates, they can't reveal their jobs and age until is allowed..\n\nThere's already jealousy on episode 1 (for what im seeing, im not gonna spoil anything even tho is just ep 1), the participants are extremely beautiful (each one of them is visual at 100% is insane), one of the girls even looks like IU lol\n\nThe panelist in Heart Signal are already better than the ones on Transit Love (Don't get me wrong, Transit love panelists are iconic), the ones on Heart Signal have to write down and select who is interested in who, who will text who, and who will end up together (each panelist winning points and all that, competitive stuff), they seem more fun too and experienced (?)",

For the first season of the Korean version, it's on OnDemandKorea.\n\nOtherwise for the Chinese versions you can find it on Tencent Video or WeTV. Check the Tencent Video/WeTV Youtube channels too, but you'll have to use auto-translate from Chinese/Mandarin or like say Thai, Vietnamese, etc. So for English subs you have to check their own Tencent Video/etc. website.\n\n**Check these threads for more info on where to watch Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/** https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zlml4b/ramyun_chill_episode_5_finale_221214/j06e2lh/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/znemtw/i_fell_in_love_with_korean_dating_shows/j0h5xw3/\n\nIf you click the first thread link above, it'll tell you about ArmsAsuncion's website (there's a Discord server for this, btw) for redditors (has Kdramas/Jdoramas/Cdramas/et cetera). It has access to all of the Heart Signal seasons, so Korean and Chinese.\n\nThere's also Heart Signal Japan from the Japanese streaming service called ABEMA but nobody has picked it up yet, so no English subs and you'll have to use machine translatation or so. This is Heart Signal Japan from the ABEMA channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2DWOkvRPRQ",

I know she's far from perfect, but I really like her nuance, seems strong but actually weak heart. and on friends we can see her growth. I don't hate HJ but she seems know how to react on guy, and she seems have strong mentality in relationship based on her conversation with her friends (bad boy BF, a lot of nagging but never breakup even when her friends told her so\ni'm following YJ and HW IG hoping one day they post something. but I really think HW is in relationship rite now",

She was so confident and natural, and is so good at fan service to the soldiers and working the crowd. Of course one top killed it as well and Se Hyung really looks more handsome through this lol. I know that military performances can be a touchy subject for some kpop fans but I always love the energy that comes with it. \n\nNow that Go won, I wonder how this will all proceed. One of the major strengths of this project was how fast-paced it was so I hope they don\u2019t lose that. Great closing ep whether they did or didn\u2019t continue, although I just couldn\u2019t see Stop winning anyway lol.",

It's always fun seeing people drop their variety persona and sort of jump into their professional mindset. She was 50/50 joking with Jae Seok with how nervous he was, while also being worried about him. \n\nThey probably won't continue until after the RM fan meet to not continue overworking Jae Seok and Haha. They will also have to plan around Kwang Hee and Se Ho's schedules. Jae Seok will probably want to figure out a way to bring back Chang Hee too. \n\nFrom Haha falling off the stage covering HOT on Infinite Challenge, to successfully covering Teen Top on HDYP 5 years later. Jae Seok and comedian friends might actually 'debut' as a boy group.",

It gives us something different for a while and allows us to look forward to their return.\n\nIt was fun watching Mijoo and Jaesuk for their differences and similarities when they performed and afterwards. Mijoo has spent half her life training and then performing as an Idol so she smoothly flirted with half the crowd during the performance and then the other half after. Jaesuk was a nervous puppy during that performance when he couldn't get the coat off his shoulders and his tie flipped over his shoulder, but he held it together without any major mistakes. Once it was over, we saw him flip into Nation's MC mode which he's been doing for half his life to smoothy chat with and take over control of the room. This wasn't just fun but also fascinating to watch.\n\nNo subs on the outro teaser for next week so I have no idea what that's about except them splitting up into teams again.",

Her 2022 Excellence Award is no fluke and hoping she will get another one this year. \n\nAs for Jinjoo, omg, she is a natural born singer. I remembered watching immortal song where gummy gave this comment after watching Jinjoo sing her song:\n\n\"Jinjoo is a great actress who sing well, but now I want to call her a great singer who act well.\"\n\nCoincidentally, in that gummy episode, 2 Wsg wannabe ended competing with each other lolz...

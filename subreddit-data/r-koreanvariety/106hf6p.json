    "postText": "**Description**\n\n&gt;The cast and guests play games to win and enjoy different foods from a featured outdoor market in Korea. The main game consists of listening to a song and determining the correct lyrics for a part of it while employing different hints to get closer to the solution. Every failed attempt means more food for YouTube mukbang star Small-mouthed Haetnim. During Snack Time a different game each week determines who gets to try a snack representing this week's market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Host**\n\n* Boom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Shin Dong-yeop\n* Kim Dong-hyun\n* Moon Se-yoon\n* Park Narae\n* Hanhae\n* Key\n* Nucksal\n* Taeyeon\n* Haetnim\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Guests**\n\n*  Doo Young\n* Sang Jun\n* Gook Ju\n* Hae Jun\n* Eun Ji \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**One Shots**\n\n|Member|2023|2022 (Final)|Overall|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Key|0|33|94|\n|Seyoon|0|16|76|\n|Hanhae|0|18|56|\n|P.O\\*|0|8|56|\n|Hyeri\\*|0|0|49|\n|Nucksal|0|12|46|\n|Narae|0|3|38|\n|Taeyeon|0|7|20|\n|Shin Dongyeob|0|2|15|\n|Donghyun|0|1|15|\n|Haetnim|0|1|1|\n\n\\*\\*updated based on Wiki'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Subtitles**\n\n|**Stream**|Link|\n|:-|:-|\n|Streaming site|[Viu](https://www.viu.com/ott/ph/en-us/vod/469321/Amazing-Saturday-2023)|\n\n**Source**\n\n\\*Viu\n\n^(\\*you can still support @/dareumi from all the subtitle works they had done for the community by donating through -)  [^(ko-fi.com/dareumi)](https://ko-fi.com/dareumi) \\+",

I'm generally not too big of a fan when it comes to gagmen because they tend to be one-dimensional and just rely on repeating their catchphrase/skit over and over again. But I think having five of them is a good thing because they kind of have to split their airtime so they don't feel repetitive. \n\n\nThe firefighter skit is really funny. The relay dance is also amazing. Overall great episode!",

She was obviously edited out, she would only show up in the instances when she was getting a rose. The girl who got mid show by solely showing up on a rose ceremony piqued the interest of audience. By the end, she had nearly the same number of Instagram followers(and why else would you go to Bachelor) as the most popular contestants.",

First, on Love Discovery Club, he was the absolute youngest on the show, and none of the women were interested in him at all.  Youku must have felt bad for him, so they put him on Twinkle Love 2, and then his main love-line had a scandal before the first episode even aired, and virtually all of his screen time was chopped.\n\n&gt; and didn't even notice anything wrong\n\nYou didn't notice the CGI christmas packages and christmas trees sitting in the chairs next to people at the dining tables in the wide shots?\n\n&gt; the editing team did an amazing job cropping her completely out\n\nThey really did.  There was the stuff in the cars, going to the camping sites in the second half of the season.  There were only a couple of shots where you could see her hand, or her shadow.  But, other than that, she was completely edited out.  It was impressive how much editing they did.",

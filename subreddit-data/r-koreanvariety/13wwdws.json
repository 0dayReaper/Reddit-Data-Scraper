    "postText": "I feel like they went back to their old roots, there are lots of dissing in recent episodes. More jokes and even Hodong doesn\u2019t do cutesy act every episode. Although some of the games are same as before in part 2, it\u2019s more fun when small skits are being added to it. To me it feels like the old days. \n\nI used to struggle to watch 1 ep per day in 2021/2022 season but now I\u2019m binging like 3 eps a day like the older seasons. Although the ratings aren\u2019t what it used to be, I\u2019m glad the variety aspect of it is getting better now.",

Last time kpop twitter made an episode look like they were creeping over young girls and the kpop twitter was raging over it. I think sensitive viewers force them to be like they are nowadays. Every joke/roast can be twisted to something else nowadays...If these sensitive fans would see the old episodes they would faint.",

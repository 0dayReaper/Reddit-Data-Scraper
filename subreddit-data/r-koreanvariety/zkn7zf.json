I get that some people are confused by Young Jae's choice but tbh I already felt that he and Seo Eun could definitely have something after their small talk. Young Jae was caring and kinda flirty with everyone but it seems like he wanted to have a more genuine and intimate conversation with Seo Eun, like they just spontaneously started giving advice about who to choose even though they didn't have much interaction before that, and it was so natural like they have known each other for a while?",

I just don't get him bringing reports \ud83d\ude06 so random *(but i guess it turned out well for him).* Anyway, who he picked for Paradise is so unexpected. I am kinda side-eyeing though for adding more person to the love polygon. Like maybe, is he a player or what?\n\nAmong the females, I think everyone is likeable, and I am getting fond of the girls falling for Yoongjae too, So-i, Sejeong and Seoeun. Their love square is so interesting and everyone is shippable with him. I  wonder how will he handle it, these girls are so charming and are also different from each other",

Apparently he went to UCLA and her korean isn\u2019t as good so I feel like he likely was the easiest for her to talk to due to his better understanding of her speaking English / Korean mix. The age gap is also hugggee as she\u2019s still a student so he was prob looking out for her. Def knew she was interested and considered it, but from the start wasn\u2019t going to choose her. He kept saying his type was Shin Seul Ki and even though I didn\u2019t ship it at first, they are a better match! \n\nNadine is lovely but I think she should try talking to more people as the romantic spark hasn\u2019t been showing up! Not a lot of flirting, more of him looking after her. Tbh I would too cuz she looks isolated and not too happy. Hope she was alright during the filming.",

            "comment": "My thoughts on the S2 cast so far.. with possible MBTI types. It\u2019s a super lengthy comment but I\u2019m just guessing their MBTI from what I\u2019ve seen so far! I\u2019m a non Korean but my husband is a Korean so I hang around with loads of Koreans most of the time so this is what I think of the cast so far. \n\nSeul Ki INFx: Seriously gorgeous without trying, definitely pure. She's so pure and innocent to the level where she's easily attracted to someone with a complete opposite personality so I can see why she'd be attracted to Dong Woo for his natural charm and good humor so it\u2019s healthy for her. Kinda rooting for this couple, but it's still early to say! Dong Woo is pretty much an extrovert so being around an introvert can be overwhelming. I feel like there's room for Se-jeong for Dong Woo, these 2 give off similar vibes. \n\nSe-jeong ExFx: She mentioned being attracted to guys with monolids and an excellent smile, and that appearance matters first before feelings. I thought she'd fancy Dong Woo at first so it was a real surprise to see her going for Yoong Jae.. I mean why?? I don\u2019t see much of a chemistry as well on both sides. \n\nChoi Jong Woo Ixxx: What a painfully awkward guy, I'm certain that women normally make the first move to approach him first so he's definitely not used to being the one to take the initiative when it comes to Seul Ki. He literally froze the moment he laid eyes on her. I kinda ship these 2 but putting 2 introverts together on a reality show can be awkward. \n\nLee So-e ExTJ: Majority of the articles I've read so far is that the production wanted a Shin Ji Yeon equivalent for this season but their vibes are miles apart. Both are visually similar but if we are to compare personalities, SJY had a much calmer and friendlier approach, SJY also knew when to draw the line and keep her emotions in check (which led to the emotional outburst on the last episode of S1) but So-e\u2019s cutesy approach was just too aggressive.. it can be a massive turn off not just to guys but to the girls as well. Remember the radish rinsing scene?? Koreans are big on honorifics and while So-e said the right things, her tone deliverance was seriously offensive, I\u2019m sure Yoong Jae must have felt it. She needs to learn how to keep her emotions in check, give other people space and learn how to play the game. I hope she\u2019ll come around in later episodes.\n\nJo Yoong-Jae INxx: I have a younger brother in law who is so wise that he appears wayyy older than he looks/talks but the keyword here is young. He mentioned about how he has had no problems with the opposite sex but we don't know the level of attractive the opposite sex is. I feel like he\u2019s 23 or 24 years old. Se-jeong is sooo attractive on the eyes, and she was openly flirting at him and the way he responded is just like any other guy who would when a sexy woman does! So I'm not surprised that he chose Seo Eun at the end of S2E2 cause he did mention looking for someone with a lot more wisdom. Looks may be a thing, but exterior without depth is just.. that. Let\u2019s not forget how torn he was when it came to choosing who to go to Paradise with. So far he had 2 choices So-e and Se Jeong, one being genuinely interested and the other easy on the eyes, he seems so innocent and painfully torn. But as soon as he spoke to Seo Eun it\u2019s like, plain obvious that he knew she could be the one, and now they\u2019re off! I am rooting for Seo Eun and YJ!! I just hope I am wrong about YJ\u2019s age because let\u2019s be frank. Seo Eun does seem much wiser than the other girls but some women don\u2019t like the idea of dating men younger than them. Kang So Yeon in S1 is a fine example. After knowing Jin Taek\u2019s age she literally shifted to Se Hoon thinking that he may be older and when no one else was giving her enough attention she just flit back to Jin Taek. Ughhhhh are they still even together??\n\nLee Nadine xSxx: She mentioned wanting to step out of her comfort zone and putting herself out there cause she's looking for a date and she doesn\u2019t mind LDR but based on what I\u2019ve seen in S2E1/E2 I truly feel that she needs to open up more to everyone. Koreans do learn English but it\u2019s a super foreign to them because it\u2019s not like they communicate it often so there\u2019s definitely a language barrier there. I\u2019m not blaming the cast for not approaching her enough but imagine being stranded on an island filming a reality show. It\u2019s mentally exhausting on both sides. And the fact of the matter is IT\u2019S A KOREAN SHOW with 100% native Koreans so I just hope she takes the initiative to socialize more and not beat herself up over by hanging on to the same guy.. She\u2019s seriously attractive and she\u2019s got gorgeous non Korean Asian features and her height is a huge asset so I really hope she\u2019ll go to paradise soon. \n\nHan Bin ESFJ: He\u2019s so kind and full of positive energy but that\u2019s it. He feels like everyone\u2019s big brother and that\u2019s kind of boring. Imagine dating an elder brother or cousin. Bleh. On a side note, I do feel that if given the opportunity, he and Seul Ki/Seo Eun would hit it off well. \n\nDong Woo ENFP: I have a friend who looks similar and he kinda behaves the same way so I sincerely believe that he is a guy who does trivial things just for the fun of it so pleaseeeeeeee stop bashing him for leading Nadine on. ENFPs are notorious for being flirty when they are really just trying to be friendly.. The girl was giving strong resting b*tch face vibes from the beginning and he was just trying to make her feel included so she could have fun as well. Nadine seems pretty young so maybe she hasn\u2019t socialized enough to know when a guy is being nice or seriously interested. Dong Woo has dropped healthy hints on being interested in Seul Ki so I don\u2019t sense much of a player vibe on his side. Y\u2019all need to calm down. At the same time.. since it\u2019s a reality tv show. I feel like he may try to know Se Jeong later UGHHH\n\nSeo Eun ?N?J: Ahhh she\u2019s a breath of fresh air. She and Seul Ki are my favorite girls so far but she\u2019s my absolute no.1 fav. She\u2019s so cool yet sophisticated without trying hard and she articulates her thoughts so gracefully, and she\u2019s beautiful and adorable too! Her choosing Yoong Jae in the last minute comes as no surprise cause there was literally a spark there when they were seeking advice from each other. Koreans are big on MBTI too so I think these 2 intuitive(s) definitely felt the spark.\n\nYuppie \nThat\u2019s about it on the cast, but my thoughts of the S2E1/E2 so far is that it feels a bit bland, maybe this time there\u2019s a script or maybe we\u2019re still early in the season to say but take what I\u2019ve said with a pinch of salt ok!! Also, I rewatched season 1 recently and I can say with utmost certainty that all of them still has a special place in my heart. Just legendary!!\n\nHope S2 gets better! Let me know your thoughts hehe.",

I also really enjoyed Seo Eun\u2019s and YJ\u2019s chemistry in Paradise, it\u2019s the most genuine chemistry I\u2019ve seen on Singles Inferno!

I\u2019m kind of surprised how uncomfortable she is to speak Korean though and how shy.\n\nBut anyways the girls are crazy stunning. Seul ki took me aback in the first scene idk how she\u2019s not as popular as jia was with the guys. Maybe bc she came out first and not last? But also seo eun and se jeong are heart throbs as well. Seo i is seemingly trying to fill the cute type but it\u2019s not effective imo compared to the other girls, I watch her talk to yoong Jae and I\u2019m like yeah she\u2019s charming! Then they show another girl talking to him and am like wait this is way more charming/better chemistry. \n\nIt\u2019s funny bc yoong Jae seems to be the most standard guy and he\u2019s the most popular. Like Han bins bright personality sticks out despite his lack of screen time, jong woo sticks out for being kinda quirky imo and dong woo has this calm confident atmosphere radiating from him. All I know about yoong Jae is his alternative foods book! I guess he has a very amiable personality that\u2019s great at going with the flow and making others comfortable/talking, which is why he\u2019s so popular. Take notes boys! Excited for the drama next week! Edit: name mistake",

I feel like Dongwoo staking her out early also caused the other men to give her space, but also because she doesn't talk much beyond one syllable answers.  I wonder if that's the real reason why Dongwoo didn't choose her.  He wanted more of a conversationalist and more fun experience in Paradise.",

They had better/flirty banter and conversation and he teases Seul Ki more (carrying the water, shrimp etc). You can see that he tends to glance at Seul Ki. I think the PD is to be blamed though, for trying to create the drama and emphasising on both Dong Woo and Nadine. But if you pick up the subtle hints, you can see Dong Woo and Seul tends to walk together (and chatting), glances at each other, teases each other etc. So yeah, I\u2019m not surprised Dong Woo chose Seul Ki because he seems to feel more sparks with her (as he mentioned in his intro vid).",

I know her age so I might be biased though. \ud83d\ude05 I mean the girls even cooed and called her \u201cBaby\u201d in so ep 2 though, which was so cute!! \ud83e\udd70\n\nWhereas Dongwoo comes off as one of the more mature guys with a nurturing quality. It was sweet that he was caring towards her and I definitely wouldn\u2019t be opposed to them getting together but I think the show just edited more of their moments and dialogue in a way that it would be more of a shock when he didn\u2019t choose her. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s too much of an age gap  (it\u2019s about10 years!) but I\u2019d be more surprised if he was compelled to choose someone who mostly gave him the static replies that she did \ud83d\ude06\n\nWith the spoiler that he is a surgeon who studied at UCLA though, they could have a lot in common as Nadine is at Harvard Pre-Med! Explains also why he didn\u2019t hesitate when she pronounced her English in a non-Korean phonetic way.\nI hope to see them connect about it later, that would be nice :)\n\nEdited to remove spoiler tags lol",

S1 Jia was massively Polarizing: The audience had a visceral reaction to her.  They either adored (J'Addore?) her, or absolutely haaaaated her.  There was very little in-between with Jia.  I think we're seeing the same reactions to Nadine.\n\nI think this season is about \"high spec\" cast members.  From what we've learned outside the show, we have **two** beauty pageant winners, a plastic surgeon, a Harvard 4th year student, and a Chef who probably owns his own restaurant.  The PDs wouldn't want to deliberately hang cast members out to dry, so I'm expecting some kind of twist or high-spec background from the remaining members.  I'm expecting the most from So E...There simply **must** be something super special in her bio that the PDs felt comfortable putting her up against the other competitors.  If there isn't, it's going to be a tough game for her.  And I'm not a fan of watching lopsided games.  I want to see a hard-fought, back-and-forth match between the strongest competitors that goes right down to the wire.  I don't want anyone to 'lock' in the 2nd episode.  There should be some believable, desperate tension of \"*Will She Or Won't She?*\" heading into episode 10...",

I also expect much more drama and maybe more heart-flutter.\n\nThis season we definitely have no one compared to Song Jia, but she\u2019s one in a million.\n\nS2 we have a lot more women who are bit like sunny sunshine Yewoon. \nAnd men are a bit more versatile this time. \n\nThe producers definitely tried to find ppl who have the same vibe like S1 contestants. \nNevertheless they cannot be compared to S1 contestants, although they have the same interests as S1 ppl.( 100% have to comment again when the show finished)  \n\nAlso was it just me, but when everyone introduced themselves in the beginning I thought \u201cdafuq they all the same and have the same vibes\u201d. \nIt was also painfully awkward (what is understandable tho).\nThe boys were chill and the girls were kinda givin very desperate vibes or were searching for the recognition and attention (?). \nOver the time most of the girls turned sweet tho and proved me wrong.\n\nSo far my favourites are Yoong Jae, Nadine and Seoeun. \nYoung Jae because he\u2019s clearly a natural, attentive and in my opinion very chill, sweet and considerate. \nNadine is sooo relatable, authentic, honest and such a strong character even tho shy. I like how easy going and in her own world she is.\nSeoeun is very likeable. open, fun, well spoken, authentic, go with the flow typa girl and very good energy. \nAlso very respectful.\nI am excited to see what\u2019s in store for them! \n\nBut I feel like Soo-e doesn\u2019t fit into the show, or atleast not with those ppl. \nDuring the show I already felt a bit uncomfortable with her around or she gave me a bit too desperate vibes (?). \nShe for sure a nice and pretty girl, but the vibe is just not on the level like the other contestants and I suspect that she\u2019ll bring a lot of drama into the show. The way she introduced herself I feel like she could end up like Moon Sehoon S1, but unlikely to be as successful (as she was already crying in the preview). I also feel like she gets very fastLy attached and is not very chill.\nThe preview where she started crying because of a guy she knew for 1-2 days, really supported my view. \n\nBut it\u2019s only the beginning and maybe I am terribly wrong.",

So-e reminded me of JY from season 1 a bit but her voice and personality are totally different.\n\nLmao \"i love how you chop onions\"\n\nWow crazy that the men's votes were all evenly distributed. \n\nNoooooooo the one who cooks the most never gets votes initially \ud83d\ude48 it's ok HB you can still turn things around.\n\nI'm liking SJ x YJ so far! Their chemistry is nice. But it also feels like YJ would get along w anyone. He'd make a great money catcher. \n\nStaying still and waiting for others to get eliminated in the chicken fight was the way to go. I think SJ could have won but she felt bad abt their size difference and went easy on So-e.\n\nI do like So-e's persistence and straightforwardness but it seems like YJ might just be being friendly to her? Not sure if he's actually interested.\n\nAlso i feel like there's a language barrier w nadine, not sure she'll be able to connect w someone in a short period of time even if there is mutual interest w DW. And also just her introverted personality on top of that. \n\nSeo-eun's advice to YJ abt being honest and following your heart was really cool. I might fall for her if I were him lol. \n\nI feel like the editing played up DW x Nadine and downplayed DW x SK. DW x Nadine didn't really click despite their efforts. \n\nDamnnnnnnn YJ really picked S-Eun! \n\nThis season is looking good. Excited for new boy next week too.",

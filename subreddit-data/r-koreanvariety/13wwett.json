**(AC 11)** kicks a short pass to the middle for **(AC 33)** who one-time short back passes to **(AC 02)**, she surveys the field and dribbles down the right wing beating **(GT 27)**, **(AC 02)** kicks a forward pass down the right wing for **(AC 33)** who traps the ball and back passes to **(AC 8)** around the centre circle, **(AC 8)** takes a deep one-time bouncy rolling shot on target that **(GT 21- GK)** smothers, i nice set of passes and a shot on target by AC!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** takes a sideline kick-in deep in AC territory with a shot on target that is

target deep in her defensive territory that **(GT 21- GK)** tracks down and follows and pushes the ball out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** takes a sideline kick-in with a power low roller shot on target that goes in the net, however, there is no other incidental contact or touch from any field player that the goal is no good!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** takes a sideline kick-in with a power low roller shot on near the goal mouth that **(AC 33)** botches the first touch but manages to get a back heel kick shot on target, that **(GT 1)** manages to block, the ball goes out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~4' GT Miss: **(GT 27)** takes a corner kick with a delicious perfect cross pass to the top of the 16 yard box that **(GT 100)** one-time shoots on target that is placed low and in the middle, **(AC 250- GK)** gets her left foot on the ball to re-direct it out of bounds for a corner kick, what a great pass, shot, and save!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~4' GT Miss: **(GT 27)** takes a corner kick with a low roller to the goal mouth area that **(AC 33)** manages to cut off and trap, she is being rushed by everyone collapsing on her position that she poke kicks the ball forward, **(GT 1)** gets to the ball first and takes a one-time shot on net that is way off target!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~5' GT Miss: **(AC 250- GK)** tosses the ball deep to **(AC 11)** but she botches the first touch and **(GT 1)** takes the ball, with a great cut move she dekes out **(AC 8)** and dribbles down the right wing, she kicks a great cross pass that goes through **(AC 33)** but holy smokes NO ONE from GT was expecting the cross pass both **(GT 27)** and **(GT 100)** were a step behind and flat footed on a great cross!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' AC Foul: **(AC 02)** and **(GT 27)** go for a 50/50 air ball, **(AC 02)** pushes **(GT 27)** out of the way and is whistled for a foul, a direct free-kick is awarded on the left wing side at the centre line!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' GT Miss: **(GT 27)** takes direct free kick with a shot on target that is blocked by **(AC 8)** the ball goes to the wing and **(GT 100)** and **(AC 8)** battle for the ball, **(GT 100)** manages to control the ball and kick an outlet pass to the opposite wing to **(GT 7)** who traps the ball and takes a shot on target that is aimed for the near side bottom right corner, **(AC 250- GK)** is well positioned and manages to smother the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' GT Skills: **(GT 1)** gets a side jumping header to keep the ball on the offensive zone, the ball dropped to **(AC 02)** who kicks it out and goes out of bounds to the sidelines!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' AC Miss: **(AC 02)** kicks the ball forward and it manages to reach a deep positioned **(AC 11)**, **(GT 21- GK)** comes off her goal line to contest the ball and kicks it out of bounds towards the sidelines before **(AC 11)** can take a shot or control the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' GT unexpected Skills: **(GT 7)** totally misses a bouncy ball and it rolls towards GT defensive end into the corner, **(GT 21- GK)** kicks the most unexpected and technically beautiful forward rolling pass down the wing for **(GT 100)** to receive, the play ends with no shot on net for GT!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' AC Miss: **(AC 8)** takes a sideline kick-in with a power shot that is blocked by the GT wall of **(GT 27)**, the ball bounces back to **(AC 8)** who takes the ball and dribbles down the right wing side and manages to take a shot on net that misses the near side post by a few feet, **(GT 21- GK)** was well positioned to cut the angles!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' GT Foul: **(AC 33)** and **(GT 27)** battle for a loose ball, looks like **(GT 27)** grabs the hand of **(AC 33)** who falls down to draw the foul, whistle blows in her favour, a direct free-kick is awarded in AC territory on the left wing side!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' AC GOAL: **(AC 8)** takes the direct free kick with a cross pass to the opposite wing side for **(AC 02)**, she beats **(GT 100)** with a self pass forward down the right wing and chases it down with a shot on target that is aimed for the far side bottom left corner that stuns everyone, **(GT 21- GK)** should have had this shot blocked, nothing special other than its spontaneous nature, the shot went through TWO GT defenders, so it was a very well placed shot on target that missed defenders, **(AC 11)** was well positioned to get any big rebounds, great AC goal!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' AC Miss: **(GT 1)** heads the ball forward with a light tap that **(AC 02)** kicks forward back into GT territory, **(AC 11)** is wide open but the ball is too deep, **(GT 21- GK)** comes off her line and gets to the ball and bodies it, wisely not using her hands as she is positioned outside of the 16yard box, the ball still loose but is eventually out of bounds on the sidelines by AC, **(AC 11) subs off for **(AC 1)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' GT Miss: **(AC 1)** tries to clear the ball forward but **(GT 7)** steps in front of the ball and re-directs it deep into AC right wing corner that **(GT 100)** tracks down, she slows the pace down and controls the ball a bit with **(AC 8)** on her back, she kicks a back pass to **(GT 7)** who one-time kicks the ball that goes to the left wing side where **(GT 27)** is all alone.  **(GT 27)** gets a one-time volley shot on target but HOLY SHIT **(AC 250- GK)** had her left hand stuck out and it hits her hand and drops in the front of both **(AC 250- GK)** and **(GT 27)**, **(AC 250- GK)** instantly drops down and smothers the ball.  WHAT A SAVE!!! i thought this shot from last week's previews was 100% a goal lolol, it was a huge save, ULTRA INSTINCT save!!!!!!&lt;\n\nHALFTIME SCORE LINE: &gt;!------- GT 0 - 1 AC------------, both teams are playing hard, with both getting offensive chances, it's just a matter of finishing their chances with a goal!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~10' GT Miss: **(GT 1)** takes the centreline kick-in with a shot on net that misses the target to the right by a few feet, GT needs to build up plays in AC territory and not lose the ball with a deep shot...!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~10' GT Miss: **(GT 1)** steals the ball from **(AC 33)** and dribbles down the left wing side being pursued by **(AC 02** she kicks a beautiful rolling cross to a wide open **(GT 100)** who traps the ball (WHY NOT ONE-TIME IT!!) and slows down the play with AC defenders frantically chasing the ball, she kicks a rolling pass to the opposite wing for **(GT 1)** to take a shot on target that is aimed for the near side bottom left corner that **(AC 250- GK)** manages to get her right hand on and the ball goes out of bounds for a corner kick, HYUNYI YAH! you just wasted a glorious one-time shot on target, and I know you can blast those with some accuracy and a whole lot of power, upon the many replays, it looks like HyunYi decided correctly as the ball was too close to her feet to manage a good shot on target!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' GT Miss: **(GT 27)** takes a corner kick with a low roller to the goal mouth area that **(AC 11)** re-directs on her own net, **(AC 250- GK)** has her eyes on the ball throughout and manages to smother the re-direction, AC was man-marking both **(GT 7)** and **(GT 100)** heavily that none of them could get free to be a pass option, GT need to start thinking of scoring the tying goal!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' GT GOAL: **(GT 27)** takes a corner kick with a low roller to top of the 16yard box area, **(GT 100)** and **(GT 7)** stayed put near the left wing side at the behest of **Coach BeomSeok**'s yelling to stay still, **Coach BeomSeok** calls go as the pass is kicked and **(GT 7)** breaks free from the suffocating man-marking of **(AC 02)** and **(AC 33)** by using **(GT 100)** as a pick and cuts towards the middle, **(GT 7)** takes a power one-time shot on target aimed centre and high and beats **(AC 250- GK)** by going between her arms trying to block it, what a beauty set piece, great pass, great shot, and great movement!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' AC Miss: **(AC 250- GK)** drops the ball for **(AC 02)** who kicks the ball forward to the left wing for **(AC 11)** who loses the ball to **(GT 7)** who kicks the ball forward that **(AC 8)** traps and kicks back to the left wing side for **(AC 11)**, this time she keeps ball control but is marked tight by **(GT 7)** so she back passes to **(AC 02)**, who kicks a deep pass down the right wing for **(AC 33)** who traps it on the sideline and kicks a cross pass for **(AC 8)** who one-time power shoots the ball on target to the wide side mid right area that **(GT 21- GK)** punches out towards the opposite wing where **(AC 11)** is all alone, she manages to botch the first touch insofar that the ball went right back to **(GT 21- GK)** who smothered the ball, great ball movement and passing!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' AC Miss: **(GT 7)** takes a sideline kick in with a pass towards the middle that goes weakly to no one, **(AC 33)** cuts the ball off and dribbles to the center circle, leaving the ball for **(AC 8)** to continue the offensive push, **(AC 8)** slows down and gathers the ball, with no GT defender near her, she sets up for a deep power shot aimed for the bottom left corner that is on target but **(GT 21- GK)** lunges over and blocks the ball with her right thigh, a huge rebound goes up in the air and **(AC 11)** gets her head on the ball but the re-direction is way off the mark and goes out of bounds for a goal kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' GT Miss: **(GT 21- GK)** kicks the ball deep into AC territory that **(GT 100)** tracks down near the right wing corner, dribbling back to her end to evade **(AC 02)** she kicks a short pass to the middle for **(GT 1)** who traps the ball and then taps the ball forward to evade both **(AC 02)** and **(AC 8)** and she runs between them to chase the ball down, she gets to the ball and takes a shot on net that is aimed for the near side bottom right corner and misses by a few feet, **(AC 250- GK)** was in position to save the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' AC GOAL: **(AC 8)** takes a sideline kick-in with a low cross near the goal mouth area that **(AC 11)** beats her defensive mark and manages to get a one-time right footed re-direction that goes to the bottom left corner for a goal, **(AC 11)**'s first league goal and a great re-direction with pace and accuracy at that!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' GT Miss: **(GT 21- GK)** throws a deep ball that bounces and **(GT 100)** chases down the right wing side, she takes a shot on net that misses the near side post by a few feet, looks like **(AC 02)** is getting a bit tired and limpy!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' AC GOAL: **(GT 27)** saves a ball from going out of bounds on the sidelines, she kicks a hard pass to the middle that **(GT 100)** botches the first touch and **(AC 8)** steals the ball and runs between **(GT 7)** and **(GT 100)** now dribbling towards the left wing and now changing direction moving forward she is a step ahead of **(GT 100)** who is trying to catch up, **(AC 8)** lays the perfectly placed soft shot to the wide side bottom right corner for a goal, GT down 2 goals with 4 minutes left, can they do it?, **(AC 1)** subs on for **(AC 02)** who needs to rest her strained calf muscles on the sidelines!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' GT Miss: **(GT 27)** takes a sideline kick-in near the centreline with a lobbing shot on target that bounces in front of **(AC 250- GK)** who misses it and the ball hits the right post!!!, the rebound bounces towards the goal mouth area where **(GT 100)** sticks out her leg to get a re-direction on net but **(AC 11)** is there to block the ball with her stomach and kicks the ball out of bounds towards the sidelines!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' GT Miss: **(GT 1)** takes a sideline kick-in with a power shot on target that is fully blocked by AC wall **(AC 11)** the ball goes back to **(GT 1)** who corrals the ball and kicks a fast and low cross to the top of the 16yard box, **(GT 100)** is there but doesn't manage a shot or a trap, the ball continues out of bounds to the opposite wing, a wasted chance, and time is ticking!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' GT Miss: **(GT 27)** takes a sideline kick-in with a power shot on target that is near the centerline moreso in GT territory, the ball is high and was a set up for a heading attempt for **(GT 1)** but the ball goes into the net with no other contact and is ruled no goal, a great shot, but not the timed to shoot like that on target!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' AC GOAL: **(AC 33)** stops **(GT 27)** from dribbling down the left wing with a strong ball stop that rebounds into GT territory **(GT 7)** is there to gather the ball but she mis-steps and falls straight down to the ground **(AC 33)** takes advantage of the mistake and charges to the ball and dribbles forward with **(GT 7)** and **(GT 1)** converging onto **(AC 33)**, **(GT 21- GK)** also moves off her goal line to cover the angles, **(AC 33)** takes a shot on target that squirts by all the GT players and rolls to the goal mouth area where **(AC 1)** is all alone and she takes a shot on the wide open net, **(AC 1)** gets her first league goal in a good display of running to the open lane rather than chasing after a ball that her teammate is in control of.  Looks like GT will have a very difficult time for a tie score.  Cannot blame **(GT 21- GK)**, she played it well, AC just played it better, **(AC 33)** subs off and **(AC 02)** enters the game!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' GT &amp; AC Sub: **(GT 7)** subs off, **(GT 66)** enters the game, first sub for GT in the game, **(AC 02)** subs off for **(AC 33)** to enter the game!&lt;\n\n\nFINAL SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- GT 1 - **4 AC**------------------------, ChaeYoung comes up big for AC in net, JeeIn gets her first goal, HaNa gets her first goal, great showing from AC, GT lost their focus, again HaeNa is the enigma, she gets goals but her first touch is terrible and she managed to messed up her footwork to cede that 4th goal.  JeongSun was strong in net just the scoreline makes her look worse, her decision making from leaving her goal line is good, HyunYi was off her game.!&lt;\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!FM v WC, WC looks strong, Naori combo having some chemistry, SoYeon outmuscling WC defense and that last shot in the previews looks like a goal, so most likely isn't hahaha!&lt;",

            "comment": "^(-No subs, only the match watched-)\n\n* I really enjoyed how from the start you could tell they were two teams more advanced in both personal skills and team play than most of the other teams we've watched. The passing, the positioning, the crosses, the shots at the goal from all different distances, and so on. They weren't peak Balladream or Lee Jung-eun out there but they were both clearly more advanced than most, if not all, of the other teams.\n* Dang, both goalies, who I've been quite low on since they started, either had the match of their lives or they are both developing real nicely. That's great for both teams, seeing as goalie was pretty much the biggest weakness for both teams.\n* I love how the Giants went over that play during halftime, ran it poorly because Actionista was so aggressively man-to-man defending them and so they ran it again and used that over aggressive defense against them, freeing up Haena to run free and shoot off the kick-in. That was a great series of events.\n* It's a bummer that both teams have players on the bench that aren't good enough to sub in to even get players some rest. Because of that, in some part, Actionista loses a key player to calf cramps and their bench player has to go in anyways. You see how gassed all of the Giants players are, lightly jogging even when an opposing team player is threatening to score. It's such a strength to have a solid player who can rotate in to rest your starters.\n* Dang, He-in vs Jin-kyung with the kick-in kick-off was so fun to watch. Both have fantastic power and precision. I know from Jin-kyung's YouTube she kept playing soccer even after leaving and she took up training and specifically worked on that (amongst everything else). It's so awesome to have her back and her not only picking up where she left off but came back an even better player than what she was when she left. Here's hoping Taejin (along with her teammates) are the same. Taejin said she is better on her radio show very recently. We'll see in the FA Cup.\n* Game over, Giants spanked. I wasn't expecting that and it didn't even feel like the gap between the teams was big. In fact it still seems small. It didn't feel like Actionista was a powerhouse and rolled the Giants. It was just who made mistakes, I think.\n* I can't help but see the anchor holding the Giants back as Haena. It seems like her most valuable quality now is as a scorer on set plays. On pure defense (defending against players with the ball) she is weak as heck and as a defender who helps her offense by passing them the ball accurately and not turning it over, she has got to be one of the worst on the show. She is the turnover queen with how often she kicks the ball out of bounds. A handful of times a game she isn't even being pressured and she just kicks it out of bounds, giving up possession to the opponent, almost always on their side of the field. If just 1/3 of those kicks out of bounds were kicks upfield for her offensive player(s) to try to obtain possession of, maintaining her teams possession of the ball, she'd be so much less of a liability. I don't see development like that coming from her given how long she has been playing on the show and how far she has developed since the pilot. Compare her to say Yubin (Top Girl) who has played for a significantly shorter amount of time and has developed by leaps and bounds. One of her best, if not her best, developments as a defender has been maintaining possession and passing the ball upfield to her offense.\n* I can't help but wonder if Kyung Hee was utilized properly given their lack of offense and the fact they gave up 4 goals anyways. However, I think because of what I detailed about Haena, the coach likely doesn't feel comfortable leaving Haena out on an island as the last line of defense before the goalie. Rightfully so. But damn, if they had a solid defender in place of Haena, at 3-1 the coach could have moved Kyung Hee up to make the offense 3 and attempt to score more goals. Their offense with Hyunyi and Jin-kyung lacks that offensive oomph needed to score. Kyung Hee is that special type of player but kept mainly back on defense she rarely gets the opportunity.\n* I'm not worried about the Giants though. As long as no one (but Haena) leaves, if they just worked on team passing they'd return as a dangerous team. Passing and better positioning. Too much staring at the ball unaware of where teammates are and too many crosses (which were great!) to no one. Learn to be in position and learn to pass to each other in order to move downfield and they're a threatening team.",

Fixed. \n\nYeah I mean, that details why she can't get off the bench in general but to me that doesn't correlate as evidence that Haena is good. They play two very different positions, defense and offense. Sure, you're right that if she was good enough on offense she could play as a forward and they could move Jin Kyung to defense but no bench player is better than Jin Kyung as a player in general. So no bench player is going to be better than her or Hyunyi or even that close. Which you wouldn't want to do unless you had a comfortable lead anyways. They were down 2-3 points and you don't remove one of your forwards for your bench player in that situation. But if she was a solid defender, you could rotate some things.",

It\u2019s frustrating and he always relies on Kyunghee too much. She can\u2019t do everything by herself. JeongSun has evolved as a goalie, I hope to see her improve even more. JinKyung kick ins are so good but her defense is so bad. \n\nFor Actionista, everyone contributed as they needed too and Chaeyoung has become a reliable goalie. She really made some incredible plays this game. They played hurt and still managed to all play well and consistent. He-In\u2019s kickins are the absolute best in the league. Ji-In surprised me, she played so well too. It\u2019s like HaeNa 2.0. I hope they take time to heal and do well in the final.\n\nCan\u2019t wait for next week.

One not having cha seo rin being able to relief Hyun yi or Jin kyung will always hamstring them and two this game shows the offensive limitations of having Kyung hee start from centerback. I understand why beom seok does it as with her being the primary dribbler it lets their offense flow easier but she\u2019s not as goal dangerous as she was last season. But even though physically Jin Kyung is more than capable of being a centerback because she is not as good of a passer and their offense stalls more. I think their best formation is 2-1-1 with Hae na and Jin Kyung as defenders Hee as the midfielder/second striker and Hyun yi up top as it gives Hee more freedom to roam. And finally He in is at her absolute peak, she has always been one of the most technical players on the show but now she is adding goals and assists to her game and I believe she is gonna be super league mvp.",

Whether it be from injury to your starters since they are more susceptible to mistakes when tired or even mistakes on the field to lead to goals against.\n\nIt's  the fine balance that winning teams find when using their subs.  TopGirl used DaYoung well in their championship run.  Even if the sub is between one field player back and forth i find that the players gain valuable playing experience to get them more comfortable with the team flow.\n\nNot playing SeoRin for most of the game was a bad mistake for the Giants.  Im not a hater of HaeNa but rather realistic.  She is very uncoordinated.  Her first touch is always terrible and her instinct to shoot the ball out of bounds while being on the giants team for so long baffles me.  She scores goals because she is well positioned but she definitely can be subbed off and you won't notice a difference.   Perhaps she should be subbed on when there's a set piece on offense like how Gaevengers do so often with all three of their offensive players, NaMi/EunHyung/MinKyung.   \n\nThe lack of playing minutes for SeoRin needs to change.  They need to find that balance to use all players.  Teach SeoRin on defending so she can be part of the game.",

All the players in the team need some experience with the pace of the game, ball touches during a game, maintaining stamina, the physicality of the game and also the team dynamic and movement. \n\nThis season above all show how badly the result can turn when your main player is out, and you have to utilize your 6th player. All the stable and menacing teams so far have fully utilized all their players.\n\nIt baffles me on why Gucheok not utilizing SeoRin at all. Her physical alone should add some scary factor to the other team. Just imagine a big giant running at you and you know she is not fully skilled enough to avoid you when \"crap\" happen. She had the advantage of height and power over Actionista smaller front, and defense. Utilize that. Plus it will help build her skills and confidence when playing. A player needs a lot of touches to hone her technique and adjusted it if need be. HaeNa is good, but utilizing SeoRin could have help Gucheok during long stretch of a game. We saw how HaeNa legs went jelly and led to a goal, because she overextended her stamina. You can see it with all the Gucheok players too, when they were not committed on closing in on HeIn and YoungJin. Gucheok has always been aggressive when defending and attacking, but I feel like in this game, they got soft and trying to be a finesse team. That style of play belong to FC TopGirl, because of their physical and skill sets. Bad timing on trying to be a different team.",

I think having her on defense in a 2-2 formation with KyungHee on the rear would have been better.  Having her on defense would make her a great option to back pass to and she can blast one on target like how YoungJin does.  I dont see JinKyung as a ball handler/dribbler.  When the space is tight she usually weaker.  Having her as a rear shooting option is best.  Her shot is probably the best on the Giants team.  KyungHee might have power but accuracy isnt there yet.",

It felt like each member of Actionista were all on top of their game while the Giants floundered and failed to play to their usual strengths. While congratulations are in order to each of the ACT members who did their jobs well, I want to give special mention to Chaeyoung for her marked improvement and Ji In for one of her best games yet. With this trajectory, I can see Actionista winning against either FM or WC and getting their champion title after so many seasons. Unfortunately for Giants, even though 3rd or 4th isn't bad and usually where they ended up, the loss of Irene feels too strong and while I don't doubt Jungseon is trying her hardest, it feels like Giants have started a steady decline despite gaining Kyunghee pretty recently. They've been my fav since day 1 so to see this game played out the way it did hurts me more than I'd like to admit. Hopefully once this tourney is over, with the FA cup looming, they find the resolve to get back on track and become more cohesive as a team.",

Watch the actual game and stop living in memories of season 1 and early season 2. It was discussed here before. Irene literally made over 15 mistakes in last 2 seasons and arguably one of the worst goalkeeper. In this show, you don't need to make super save but you can't make obvious mistakes and deliver free goals. Irene wouldn't save any of the goals in this game and would only concede more",

The Giants still, compared to other SL teams, have an issue with being more easily shaken up mentally. Are they the worst team in terms of skill? No, of course not, but Hyunyi was clearly not having a good day and with nobody else who can lead/lift the team up (including the coach), you can feel a definite difference in performance. And yes, Actionista did simply play much better, but it is also a bit worrying when out of all the games the Giants played this season, the only one that felt like a good one was last game where they were focused and all played with a strong intent to win, with the show even commenting that it felt like there were six Hyunyis. \n\nI made the above post as a HUGE Giants fan hoping they overcome this hurdle of losing an OG member and not finding a clear solution to their defense problem, and not because I think they're just on a straight decline; even with these problems, they're not leaving the SL anytime soon. When most of the other teams feel like they're progressing as a whole, more individual members that weren't as good are making noticeable strides, and the fact that this season we have some of the best GK moments from both the CL and the SL, the Giants definitely feel like they're on the back pedal in many aspects.",

ChaeYoung had to pick this week to do well, out of all the weeks that they played so far. Crazy stuff. StrangeJiIn finally complete her training and showed her true potential. She is still hilarious though. The question that has to be asked, is Actionista somehow ,managed to use their bad luck and turn them into opportunity? We saw these over and over again. Just when one of their teammate was down, they all started to showed up. \n\nFC Gucheok, oh my beloved Gucheok. Despite being a better team overall, they were still unable to capitalize on their advantages. It speaks volume in term of their overall mentality, and also the ability of Coack BeomSeok to make a team better. So many miss chances, out of positioning, inability to adapt/change to the game flow/tactics. Why do you keep giving chance to the best kicker in the league (HeIn) to dictate the pace of the game. Despite outmatching your opponents physically and skill-wise, you are still unable to control the game.

There's still the battle for third and they should be in good shape for that too. !&lt;\nExcited for next week. WC is clearly best between the 2 but we can't count Firemoth out yet",

WC needs to use their passing ability to generate good chances but can they finish with good shots is the question. \n\nI cant wait to see who will battle for the gold medal game.  Next week looks like a very competitive game between two teams playing with purpose.",

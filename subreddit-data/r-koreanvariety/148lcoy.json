    "postText": "So in this latest episode, I notice two guys who are eating in the restaurant have their faces covered/blurred.  \n Arent they already know beforehand to be recorded for their reaction and action or they request their face to be covered.  \n Anyway, the number of ramyun they sell also getting increased. Such a shame seafood ramyun getting removed. Maybe they should put some temporary tents for the customer queuing outside",

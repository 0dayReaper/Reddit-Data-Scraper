I sincerely thought that the cast revamp clearly shitty after SSR and CEW left the program. On MyDramaList, User cdvmty actually posted why  Yoo Su Bin  Lee Dae Ho Bambam Kim Do Young Kim Dong Hyun Eun Ji Won /Yang Se Hyung without Lee Seung Gi,  \"flaws\". Just wanted to clarify cast revamp for myself  FAILED. Badly. I \ud83e\udd14 concept also has flaw as some of the Masters weren't as good. Fluctuating quality.",

    "postText": "There have been members creating posts with the wrong flair picked.\n\nOnly use the Raw &amp; Subtitled flairs when creating a post for sharing a show episode or series for others.\n\nRequesting episodes of a show does not condone the use of the Raw or Subtitled flair.   \nUse the Question &amp; Help flair for requests.   \nI have been modifying flairs but soon I'll just remove your post for incorrect flair use.\n\nUpdate:   \nI just unlocked this post to get feedback about a new flair called \"Requests\".   \nOr should I just make a sticky post called \"Show &amp; Episode Requests\" so members who want something can just ask in there? Sometimes there's a dead torrent or subtitle, and maybe someone can help the person out. I usually resend old HDYP subtitles to members.  \n",

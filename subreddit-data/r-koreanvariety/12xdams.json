Instead of fancy studio, this on-the-road reality show takes place in the rural sides.

Even Dindin seems to have brightened up. He's back to being endearing throughout the trip. The power of putting them in the same place and having simple but fun games is still the best! \n\nI don't really care about the ratings because we've been laughing so hard every week! Also, runningman being in the same slot again probably didn't help with their rating going down. So I get it.",

His breathing may be extremely obstructed, and the labor/strain of that kind of snoring doesn't allow for restful sleep.\n\nHe snores like that even when he sleeps on his side, even though he's young and not overweight. The health consequences of sleep disturbances can be dire.\n\nSomebody send this man to a sleep study. Please.",

He very well may be fine.\n\nBut if someone snores, there's a 75% chance that there's some degree of apnea going on. So I don't know if I'd call it probable or something else...\n\nInwoo has said on the show that he doesn't wake up feeling rested, and that he has other sleep issues like insomina.\n\nI wish 2D1N would somehow incorporate going to a sleep clinic as part of a mission.

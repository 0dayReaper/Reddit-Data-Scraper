It's horrifying that he (allegedly ahem) stole billions and billions of won from his little brother. \n\nYonhap News [article](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/MYH20220913021300641) transcript in Korean.\n\n[Link](https://www-yna-co-kr.translate.goog/view/MYH20220913021300641?_x_tr_sl=ko&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp) to article run through google translate.\n\n\n\n&gt;\\[News Review\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[anchor\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Park Jin-hong, his older brother, was arrested on charges of intercepting broadcaster Park Soo-hong's appearance fees, etc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Park  is suspected of embezzling 11.6 billion won in profits while running  Park Soo-hong's management corporation for the past 30 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;This is reporter Kim Ye-rim.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[reporter\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A battle over money damage between broadcaster Park Soo-hong and his older brother Park Jin-hong, which led to a legal battle.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The  Seoul Western District Court conducted interrogation of the suspect  before arresting Park Jin-hong and issued an arrest warrant.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Earlier  last week, the prosecution requested an arrest warrant for Park  Jin-hong on charges of embezzlement under the Special Cases Act.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This  incident first surfaced in March of last year when a comment was posted  on Park Soo-hong's YouTube channel saying that his brother and his wife  had hijacked Park Soo-hong's appearance fee for 30 years.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At  that time, Park Soo-hong's side claimed that the older brother and wife  did not keep the management company's profit sharing promise and  embezzled the company's funds and appearance fees.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Although  he proposed a settlement agreement, he submitted a complaint to the  Seoul Western District Prosecutors' Office in April last year, saying  that his brother did not show any will to settle.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Apart  from the criminal complaint, Park Soo-hong is also in the process of  filing a claim for damages against his older brother last year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At  first, they demanded about 8.6 billion won in damages, but they  increased the demand by 3 billion won, saying that an additional charge  of embezzlement of a personal account was revealed.",

It sucks because he will never have the same relationship with his family ever again. But man, to think that the reason PSH was able to catch all this was because he was trying to lower the rent for the residents of the building he thought he owned when it wasn't even under his name. He was trying to do a good deed because Covid affected a lot of people and he wanted to make rent cheaper for his tenants. Only to find out the building wasn't registered under his name and his own brother was stealing from him. It's just so sad. I hope all his friends are surrounding him with support and maybe someone like Jang Yoon Jung who went through a similar situation with her own mother and brother could give him some good advice on how she coped with everything after. I know PSH got married recently, I hope his wife is a good support system for him too. Wish him all the best and hopefully, we can see him back on shows and be active.",

The only reason why they aren't getting much flack for it is because Park Soo Hong came out and defended his parents. It just shows how nice he is tbh. But people seem to forget, his own dad literally boasted about bringing a hammer to Park Soo Hong's house to threaten him not to cause his older brother trouble and to drop the case. Thankfully, PSH didn't listen. PSH even tried to settle everything without going to court but the brother didn't want to settle and basically ran and hid with his family. It's good progress to see his brother got caught. Although, a year is way too long and the brother was probably able to figure out a way to hide money in an offshore account and to hide more evidence. I hope the courts treats this case very seriously and all those involved should suffer the consequences of their actions.",

Asian culture and the favoritism towards the eldest son is real. I think his parents are messed up on all levels to protect the older brother. Park Soo Hong's dad assaulted him today. No update yet on how serious the injuries are. In many Asian cultures, the eldest child is normally the one responsible to take care of the aging parents. For those wondering why the parents might be dumb enough to take the side of the eldest brother, their future is dependent on the eldest. But if he goes to jail, they're probably scared that no one will take care of them.",

That's why many of his entertainment friends would always joke around and wonder why he has no money even though he's been working and hosting shows for so many years and he has always been busy.",

His mom and brother and sister in law kept discouraging him from getting married because they would lose their power over him and his finances. In SKorea, it is normal for the wife to handle the finances of the household. Plus, if he got married and he has his own kids then they would be PSH's first priority and the brother and parents probably feared being cut off. Plus, PSH would've found out about what's happening to his finances a lot quicker but his parents and brother always disapproved of any women he wanted to marry and yet his mom was on the show saying the opposite and wanting him to marry when she was one of the people not approving any of the women he introduced to them. PSH said it on other shows that he wanted his family's approval of his girlfriend before marrying her because he trusted his family's judgement but his family never did. Now we know why. Also, his mom would have to leave the show too if he got married and she enjoyed being on the show.",

                    "comment": "For the East Asian dating shows, or really any show, it's sometimes better to watch it chronologically or from the beginning as you can see how they change the show's format, activities, et cetera over the next seasons.\n\nWith EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560), that one is what spurred a bunch of other dating shows with the premise of former lovers/friends/etc. meeting in a dating show and pretending to not know each other.\n\nAt the moment the current influential dating shows in East Asia goes like this: **Terrace House** inspired **Heart Signal** and then Heart Signal generated Transit Love/EXchange. Single\u2019s Inferno is also kinda in this as a lot of island/beach/etc. shows got made because of it.\n\nUsually in these dating shows the cast will be self-contained but there will be sometimes references/spoilers/etc. to the previous season's cast, so that's why it's kinda better to begin from the start.\n\nFor example **I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO (/r/IamSolo) Season 7 has a legendary girl named Ok Soon**, like people have expectations with her name now. But these past few seasons they probably purposely miscast people to remove the fame attached to the name.\n\nSeason 7 starts at Episode 39, ends with Episode 44. Each season of I Am Solo is say 6-8 episodes and they can be watched standalone, no need to watch the previous seasons.\n\n---\n\nAnyway, for EXchange/Transit Love 2 (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc5602) there's no scenes or cameos from the Season 1 cast. Like there was maybe a flashback or something in the beginning or previews, but never really after that.\n\nThey had an unexpected situation with EXchange/Transit Love 2 too that prompted for unanticipated changes, but still try to watch from the very first episode.\n\nLike the episodes can be truly emotional and sometimes 2 hours or so long (and Season 2 has 20 episodes), and so you'll likely also cry, feel angst, and so on with the panelists when the exes/former couples are dealing with their past problems. Even Kpop idols and so on were watching it weekly, it was viral. The show is so easy to binge-watch, Season 2 of EXchange/Transit Love is available on VIU too.\n\n**Some of the main threads for Season 1 of EXchange/Transit Love were**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/ph1ehp/tvn_exchange_transit_love_e110/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/q4oui5/transit_love_kreng_subs/\n\n**This is a thread to find Season 1 of EXchange/Transit Love: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/ro8n5f/exchange_transit_love_e01e15/**\n\nA lot of Korean dating shows get fansubbed by some folks here from /r/koreanvariety. For Japanese/Chinese/etc. dating shows, check /r/terracehouse and so on as some people sometimes put more info there.\n\nYou'll have to use a VPN to access region-restricted content (this is mainly with VIU, Netflix, Disney+, etc.). These days some streaming services will not allow free and/or paid VPNs to access their content, so definitely do a lot of research if you want to use it for say Netflix and other sites.\n\nYou'll probably need a VPN set to (Southeast) Asia with these Asian streaming services, check this for a bit more info: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zobw4m/where_can_i_watch_variety_shows_here_in_spain/j0m09qv/\n\nTry to use a VPN for Viki/VIU/etc. and set it to Singapore or Malaysia or some other country, it should give you more access to different content.\n\nA lot of fansubs (or official subs) get uploaded/ripped later on the usual streaming sites too, so the option is there too.\n\n---\n\nSo Season 2 of EXchange/Transit Love had so much more potential but ya there was a derailment of some ships and so for some people Season 1 will still be preferred. And yup, start there to get an idea of what they wanted to originally do for the show's concept, et cetera.\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and more info on where to watch them**: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zqf0dp/singles_inferno_2_ep_3_4_20221220/j147u12/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/z7khcr/eden_2_ep_3_20221129/iybc97n/ &lt;--- check this link for where to watch other dating shows.\n\nThis thread has the different names of streaming/OTT services (like TVING, Coupang Play, wavve, etc.) or websites and the various Youtube channels and links for where to watch some of these dating shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yktjg9/can_anyone_suggest_some_kdating_shows/iuvbg43/\n\nCheck this link for somewhat updated and consolidated thread links: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/zx36d6/who_are_the_legendary_or_iconic_cast_members_of/j2094j5/\n\n---\n\nPara sa kaibigan at kababayan, there's our fellow **ArmsAsuncion's website for redditors (has East Asian variety shows, Kdramas/Jdoramas/Cdramas/et cetera)**. That website has access to Viki, VIU, OnDemandKorea (this usually has no English subs though), iQIYI, and now WeTV/Tencent Video content. So no Netflix or Disney+ or not really the newer Korean OTT services/platforms (as they don't usually have English subs) like wavve, Coupang Play, etc.\n\nBut yes, ArmsAsuncion's website will have you covered usually with KOCOWA/etc. stuff and no significant popups (use /r/uBlockOrigin if you aren't already) or low bitrate, et cetera unlike other streaming sites like the Malay tteokbeokki/noonaspoiler site.",

I think she was only intrested in Gyumin and he felt like she was more like a sister according to him. He became intrested in Nayeon very quickly after the thier first date and Jisoo was upset about it, Woonbin comforted her and everything went sour. Problem arose as well when Jisoo called out Nayeon about the hug with Taei, most agreed with her but some thought it was unesseary.

I think everyone knows he really deserves it but there just wasn\u2019t enough awards to go around and the other members are more senior in the variety / entertainment world as well, and we all know that Kim Seon Ho\u2019s popularity skyrocketed. \n\nAt least he got to show off a bomb ass performance and I think he\u2019s really well liked but the general public and by fans as well. We\u2019ll never really know but he does seem like a good guy.",

She really did work really hard for KBS this year \n\nRavi's performance was literally THE BOMB I love you Kim wonsik \u2764\ufe0f I sometimes forget how charismatic and cool he is as an artiste lmao. The boys' Move performance though... I died from the cringe \n HAHAHAHA. Jongmin and Dindin clearly don't know what \"restrained sexiness\" is, Junghoon and Seyoon were being dead serious about their dance, while Seonho and Ravi were just trying so hard not to laugh \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nJongmin's prepared speech is hilarious \ud83d\ude02 Even Jongmin agrees that Smiley PD is like their mom lol",

Watching 2D1N made me appreciate more the people behind this kind of show. Each of them deserves recognition.\n\nAnd the boys' performance? HAHAHAHAHA! It was like a group presentation but they're graded individually. Some were overdoing it, some looked like they're just doing it for compliance. But man, was I grinning and cheering like a proud mom.\n\nI hope this season/group lasts for a long time. I'll be sad tho when Ravi leaves for his enlistment.",

Most prolly Ravi will get his rookie award next year. I was really sad our variety robot didnt get any award this year after watching how hard he works and all the funnies he made.

It just feel weird that both of them didnt get any recognition when all the other members and even the program got one each when we know they also contribute a lot to the show. Anyway I'm proud with all of them and Ravi for stealing the limelight with their cool and sexy dance \ud83d\ude05 that's why 2d1n is the best!",

You might think he is slow but the guy is a machine especially in 2020 he did so many shows so its only fair sometimes he struggles. I would say start from your prefered cast season 1 and season 3 are fan favorite so I guess one of those 2.\n\nEdit: Season 4 is my fav.",

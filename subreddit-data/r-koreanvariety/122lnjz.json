Finding out they had to pay for tp was pretty funny and I am sure they won't let leave them out for dry if there really was an emergency bathroom need. They ended up getting the necessary points not too long after anyway.\n\nAlso I thought the games were less strict compared to some NA PD shows fot example and overall the episodes have gone by super fast and had me laughing and smiling the whole way through. Suggesting things like giving points for getting 96 when the goal is 97 is a terrible idea, falling 1 point short and getting nothing is like the dream variety scenario. Getting the flip perfect 3 times in a row and then failing the real thing is also pretty much the dream scenario for that challenge.\n\nGetting caught sneaking snacks and having to face the consequence of their actions is also funny, way funnier than letting them off. Dunno I think people are missing a key point and don't understand that these games need to have real stakes for them to be truly intense.\n\nAnd that's not to mention that they might have only won one game but it was worth 4k points. I am sure the staff would have let them have points more easily or given them catch up games if they really ended up penniless and without a meal.",

Usually in their in house variety shows or if they are guests in other shows, the challenges are easier and the staff can be swayed by the idols. If the cast was filled with variety show veterans like Mijoo and Somin, then they would probably be fine with the hard games.\n\nEven Amazing Saturday was really strict, since you needed to get every single character right, or you lose the round.\n\nI agree that this is first and foremost, a variety show, so seeing them fail by just a point is much funnier, and it would make it more satisfying when they get the hang of the games and start winning. It wouldn't be as fun to see them just ace all the games at the start.",

It's so easy to miss one and go from 2000 or so points to nothing.\n\nLike you have to pinpoint a song with a 2 second clip 6 different times. That's honestly impossible. They go freaking obscure as hell too and only one needs to fuck you up. \n\nSide note, it's also bad game mechanics. The smart thing to do would be tanking the first few rounds, so you have a chance at taking home at least like 500 points, but obviously that kind of messes with the spirit of the game.",

They just were able to buy the table set and had a decent meal, etc. The balancing of the games doesn't seem impossible, just hard enough to mean something when they manage to do it. I'd rather have a low quote of success with clear highlights than them winning almost all with only a few fails, this is way more exciting this way. It's just very humorous that they are rather good in the practice rounds at times, but then choke it when it counts (solo challenge bottle for example).  \nI think they are progressing in a decent fashion tbh, it's 3 episodes in, with 9 following, and they already have some rather important items.  \n  \nI agree with you about the chatting in between though, would like to see a little more of that.",

The cast is definitely better now with Yena, but it's clear the problem with this show is the PD. There's no give and take with the staff, it's only take, take, take. &gt;!How many 0-fers does the cast have to have before he realizes he's the problem here? It seemed like maybe he learned from the previous 2 episodes to allow them to stop in that first game, but then it went right back to extreme hard mode on the games. Only one chance with a bottle flip? 97+ on those fickle karaoke machines? In an hour and a half they only won one game and the PD has the nerve to take it away for eating snacks they paid for with their own money? Did I miss the part where the staff came into the house and paid Miyeon real cash to compensate for the snacks she brought? I've watched this choreo game during the Amazing Saturday snack round, and it is a lot of fun when the cast watch each other to get clues. If you're going to have a hard and fast time limit, why can't the person up front look back to see other people doing the real dance they figured out? Having a host like Boom on Amazing Saturday analyzing the cast struggles and then 'messing up' something to give away hints in real time to adjust the game difficulty makes the show a lot better in that you know the cast always has a chance. This cast doesn't have a chance here so there's no suspense.!&lt;",

                            "comment": "* Yes Chaewon missed by one point because the target was set at 97 instead of something a little more plausible like 95. Out of hundreds of karaoke rounds I've seen in k-variety and kpop, maybe 6 or 7 got 97 or higher. That jumps to about 30 I've seen that got 95+.\n* Only 1 chance per bottle flip instead of 3 chances or a time limit like 10 seconds.\n* No one knew the last choreo in that game. So even if the first 5 got the choreo right, they would still come away with 0 points like they did this time because of the stupid all-or-nothing rule.\n\nWatch a show with Na PD like *Earth Arcade* and compare. When he had individual games for things like ice cream or snacks, you pulled a random game and got to try just like here. If you failed, you could try again after taking a punishment like eating a lemon wedge or a carrot. In that show, it's funny to watch them keep failing and keep doing a punishment to try again because you knew there was a shot they could win. Here, it was one and done, and there were games that could not even be accomplished like the dictionary game. They could have given them 5 minutes to find a word and they would have still failed when forced to wear those plastic gloves.\n\nThat said, it's good that you like it. I think the show has a lot of potential with this cast if the PD and staff fix the game difficulty into something a little more reasonable.",

Or doing Idol Random Dance Play. Or the iconic thing in 1n2d S1 where they did a camera prank Hojin PD out of nowhere because he was a rookie PD at that time. \n\nI cant fault the cast for it though. Even the PD noticed it when Hyeri do a solo monologue with Hyeri and him saying \"I saw you struggling to mingle\". That seems to indicate they arent comfortable yet with each other. Which is understandable. There is a reason Earth Arcade got Lee Eunji. Or 1n2d has one comedian at least per season (LSG, Kim Jun Ho, Moon Se Yoon). Imo, the PD probably expected Hyeri to do it but she was/is an idol.",

They should've had a success rate well over 50%.\n\nThe only real mess up was the dictionary challenge. They didn't even get close.\n\nThe dancing was not their fault. And also they make the last question a softball. They gave Leejung a Blackpink song. And they're going to have multiple rounds.\n\nThe odds of the cast failing so much were tiny and honestly it makes it entertaining. They had a fair chance. When Chaewon got Tomboy I thought she'd get it. Twists like that give the games stakes.\n\nIt's unsatisfying if the contestants get too many chances at redemption. Sure they might have to do punishments, but that's a temporary consequence. The weight of failure is how we get Chaewon and Yena bickering.",

It answers a question and provides some entertainment. We know now that they can't do it and what happens if they do. Will they try again in a more convoluted way? I hope so because it would be a fun running gag, but it's doubtful due to the rarity of points.  \n  \nThey haven't been able to add anything to the house which creates opportunity for entertainment yet &gt;!(aside from gonggi, which they got some screen time out of)!&lt;. If they aren't able to start filling the house with at least 1 or 2 things each week, then it's just games with limited interactions outside of them.  \nLike I said before, it would be entertaining if they could build some of the furniture they've bought, decorate and take pride in their home and what they've accomplished, indulge in some things like the sauna, etc.  \nYou can even give them free/cheap things but with a catch. No cups? Here's a beer hat. No pillow? Here's a cushion of a member making a funny face. It would actually be funnier if they were guaranteed a \"prize\" but the number of correct answers determined the quality. 6 questions right? Luxurious and comfy couch. Only 1 question right? Old and beaten up loveseat with a hideous color/pattern.  \n  \nFor bonding, you want them to experience difficulty and overcome it together, then enjoy the fruits of their labor. If there's no overcoming or rewards to enjoy, there's less bonding.",

And for the picture game, they could try the levels without fear of losing all they already obtained. \nI noticed that a lot of the gals keep mentioning anxiety and burden when they mess up the flow and get something wrong. Games should not be this stressful. Especially when winning and losing is a matter or eating or not. Ngl. Episodes one and two were hilarious. But I hated that they were stressed about USING THE RESTROOM and DRINKING WATER. Those are literal basic human needs. It\u2019s a freaking variety show that didn\u2019t even properly mentally prepare them for the hardships. PD needs to CHILL. especially with eating the snacks. They\u2019re young adults constantly performing and doing games in the cold. Let them snack jfc\n\nThe choreo game is obviously so hard. At least give them unlimited time to answer. I\u2019m going to keep watching, but it may get hard if they keep so hard with the cash.",

It's great to see Yena back in a group as her variety skills are all about interaction with others. She's an expert at knowing how to mess with people.

I don't think there's a big problem since some moments are perfect for variety such as failing the karoake thing by 1 point but it's just been too much fails for 3 eps. I like the ideas that some challenges are only one try and some are all or nothing but feel like games such as them guessing choreo or songs would be fun if they had more chances because it could mean they would have more content of the game's being played, I really like those games and want to see more of em.\n\nEp ended on a p weird note as well I know they want to do a cliffhanger but it was a pretty weird ending to an ep, somewhat abrupt.\n\nOverall though those are some of my complaints but I really like the entire cast I enjoy seeing SsamYen be together again after so long and seeing some IZ*ONE x IDLE interactions as well. Miyeon is one of my faves in IDLE and so are SsamYen so it's fun to see interactions, alongside Hyeri as well.\n\nI think the show needs to have more inbetween segments of just the cast though, the gonggi game was one of my fave moments of the entire ep because it was just the cast chilling alongside themselves. Feel like the show needs more of that because the cast has amazing chemistry and not just from the obvious ones like IZ*ONE members or a lot of em being idols/involved in the idol industry but they just click together as a whole.\n\nShow could benefit from some moments like that more instead of just going to the next quest quickly and then all of em just fail which is hilarious ofc but it's kinda been the same old thing for 3 eps, but then again in 3 eps they have already gotten some essentials so I hope by the end of the series some of my complaints would just be incorrect in hindsight.",

As their chaos funny energy are bit lacking still especially outside of Hyeri, miyeon n patricia n chaewon shows potential but she's still doesn't seem to go all in yet, Yena should be another one that could push more members forward",

But the others don't have the same level of skills yet and you can tell PD seems a little lost at what to do. They want to stick to the carefully planned script but its not working the way they wanted and they're scrambling.",

Chaewon / Yena are just using their dynamic from their PD48 / IZ\\*ONE days with how they played together (IZ\\*ONE Arcade, IZ\\*ONE Chu, Eating Trip, etc). I enjoy Miyeon more when she is getting picked on by her kids (Minnie, Yuqi, and Shuhua). I don't really put any pressure on Patricia since I understand she has to be careful around 4 idols while also being the youngest. \n\nSince I assume Tae Kyung really wanted Hyeri to be the 'leader' of this show, it limits their options of pulling in young female comedians or actors, but I feel like they needed to reach out to balance the members. I wish Hyeri was 1 year older since that could have opened up the possibility of adding a wildcard like Gabee.",

And taking their points because they brought snacks without explicitly telling them not to bring any? I mean, of course they would bring something, considering they barely earned points to eat last week. And it's not like they brought ramen or proper food, just some gummies -.- That got me pretty annoyed.\n\nOtherwise, Hyeri's edit and interview about not understanding tiktok trends was relatable. The gonggi game was also very intense and provided good entertainment. Good thing the girls decided to buy it and give the PD some free footage. I really enjoy the show but the harsh rules and restrictions, making it impossible to win, sometimes make it less fun. EA cast was also often failing and losing prizes, but it didn't feel as frustrating.",

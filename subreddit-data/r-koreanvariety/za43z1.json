My guess is that HYBE wanted to avoid the gugudan/Weki-Meki/Ive problem of having one (or two) famous ex-Produce 101 member(s), with the others dropping into the background.  Le Sserafim has done an excellent job of making sure Yunjin, Kazuha, and Eunchae have exposure and profile within the group.  The worst thing for Le Sserafim would be for it to wind up like Gugudan as \"'God' Sejeong and Friends\".\n\nPart of that strategy **looks** like Sakura taking a lower profile for a couple of the first Korean releases, so the others can gain traction. It's a very unselfish move by Sakura, and hugely beneficial to the overall team.  It shows how committed she is to making Le Sserafim into a powerhouse in the Korean domestic market.  \n\nHowever, I'd still bet that Sakura still runs the Japanese releases, just because you absolutely **need** her ex-AKB48/ex-IZ\\*ONE profile to connect with the Japanese fanbase.  HYBE knows that Sakura and Chaewon were pivotal members when they built the Le Sserafim lineup, as they were the top highfive revenue generators during IZ\\*ONE Japanese promotions.  They started with Sakura, negotiating for almost a year to get her.  They then traded to get Chaewon from Woolim, transfered Huh Yunjin from the Pledis farm league system, and then headhunted Kazuha as a free agent signing, to pick up another Japanese player to help with the Japanese promotions.\n\nSo, yeah, Sakura hasn't **appeared** as aggressive in her Korean variety appearances as she was during IZ\\*ONE, but I'm sure it's by design.\n\nAs a side-note, I'd love to see Sakura's contract with HYBE.  She had so much leverage during those negotiations that she must be getting close to a 90/10 revenue split, with plenty of freedom to do special variety and other projects, so long as they don't clash with Le Sserafim promotions.  Even when she was in IZ\\*ONE, she still kept her weekly Japanese radio show, [Saku no Ki](https://iz-one.fandom.com/wiki/Saku_no_Ki).  I'm not sure if she's still doing her gaming live-streams. I'd expect her to do more of her own schedules, starting with the 2nd or 3rd year of her Le Sserafim initial contract.",

But her Korean has gotten a lot better to the point where she can understand regional dialects using her own intuition.  She can even understand what Kang Ho dong says because before she just reacted to him on Everyone's Kitchen. Sakura relied a lot on her iz*one members back then but now, she can understand more of what's going on.",

It was a TV show\ud83d\ude02\n\nThe video is a shopping/unboxing (Louis Vuitton/etc.) one, lol, you can kinda actually understand her if you turn on the Google/Youtube auto-translate. Like Youtube auto-translate is so good these days for certain languages. \n\nDahae could be trolling, you never know.\n\nBut ya, if she's not then she might be unable to go as usually they don't allow people to appear in multiple game/dating/etc. shows on TV (it's on Disney+ or an on-demand service though) unless they're really popular or have a storyline to play.\n\nSometimes the casting process is several months before and so she might've missed timing for Single's Inferno 2 and Eden 2. And then Pink Lie was left. Or like the other producers didn't want somebody similar to Song Jia from Single's Inferno 1 or something like that, lol.\n\nOr sometimes the producers will specifically recruit certain influencers or like people they know as they hope it'd produce good reactions and so on.\n\nSee **UnREAL with Rachel or Shiri Appleby**. In UnREAL they show you how shows like The Bachelor and so on are produced, lol.\n\nThere's also the **Love is for Suckers** (has Lee Da-hee and Choi Si-won) Kdrama and it finished two weeks ago. Kingdom of Love 2 (the dating reality show inside Love is for Suckers) is mainly based around probably I Am Solo/\ub098\ub294 SOLO (/r/IamSolo) and so on, like if you watch I Am Solo you'll see familiar stuff, references, et cetera.\n\nLove is for Suckers will show you how Korean PDnims/producers/writers/etc. do dating shows behind the scenes, pre-production, and so on.",

He really is a &gt;!prime example of how sincerity and responsibility could win a woman\u2019s heart!&lt;. \n\nAnd then you have Hangyeol who &gt;!remained prejudiced after Hanui\u2019s secret was out!&lt;. I\u2019m not even surprised because ever since he revealed his lie, his actions thereafter had been questionable and distasteful. Heck, even Taeyang and Hanu were more perceptive in their interviews.\n\nAfter the Chanel incident, I\u2019m glad Chansol maturely expressed his opinions to Dahae. Her privileged background may have made her one way, but her interactions with the cast mates have always been sincere. Her acceptance of Chansol\u2019s critique showed that there\u2019s room for her to mature as a person.",

So while there is no actual sex, it is close. And yes, it is still considered porn.\n\nSecond, many Korean films have nudity and sex scenes. A lot of Korean films are ultra violent as well. \n\nThird, there is a huge difference between a porn movie VS a regular movie that has a nude sex scene. \n\n&gt; if she was in the states or even canada no one would give a single fuck about her past \u201cadult actress\u201d career. people get fked onlyfans for a living..\n\nSee, I think THAT is very weird. The fact that countries like America glorifies and monetizes stuff like that. It's degenerate. And it's disturbing that stuff like that has become the norm in western cultures. Please stop trying to force your beliefs onto the rest of the world. There are FAR more conservative countries than Korea where you would be sent to prison for stuff like that. You should learn to respect how other societies in the world have different cultures and different values, instead of trying to shame them and look down on them with western superiority complex. Because I guarantee that from the perspective of many countries in this world, American culture is the one that looks unpleasant.",

For example, when Chansol wondered if he could continue with Daehee because his life was too different when he knew her secret for a long time.

For example, when Chansol wondered if he could continue with Daehee because his life was too different when he knew her secret for a long time. This dramatization was too much for me.\n\nIt seems relatively appropriate to me, I think it's because she never actually portrayed any of these characteristics or spending until the last day, she held off, but honestly if they were to redo and she had that attitude, even if they didn't know how much money she had exactly, then I think it would be very different. One of the main things she said in her interview was that she expects her bf to go halves on everything with her and if they can't then they should be dating her, I dont think anyone on that show has 15mil won to spend with her, so I can understand why he would be cautious in a real life situation outside of the show. In the show, she's not allowed to act like that, but in irl, there's no reason for her to not. Example: she wants to go to an expensive restaurant to eat thats several hundred thousand won for a meal, if he can't afford that, would this relationship still work? Would Dahae be willing to pay for the whole meal or go somewhere else that isn't as expensive, or does it have to be: my bf has to go with me and they have to pay hundreds of thousands won. Also she doesn't have to work, and not sure who's in her friend circle, but can she navigate dating someone who has to work? She has so much free time, would depending on who she's dating and her dating style (seems more on the clingy side), does that person also need to have a free schedule that aligns with hers to be able to hang out?\n\nit might seem like chansol had a lot of time to consider, but he had less than 11 days which already isn't a lot of time to process all this information, let alone consider how you're going to continue a relationship with someone who choose to act different than how you know of them in that 11 day time period. All the other contestants even said that the girl in the video didn't seem like the dahae they knew, she could be acting/exaggerating (either in the video or in the house, or it's both her, we don't know). He could have thought that personality they saw was only for the video, but then the moment she brought out the purse after her secret was revealed, it hit him that he needs to consider both sides of her fully.",

I am glad that the most original owner of cells left esp. &gt;!Haneul and also Hangyeol not picking her!&lt;. &gt;!\ud83d\udd25+\ud83d\udd25 were really extinguished by water!&lt;. The one surprised the most with Hangyeol &amp; Seulbi's final pick. Seulbi picking &gt;!Bareum, whoa, the production made a good video of making it Hangyeol. I wouldn't judge her if she'll pick him though, it's just reality. !&lt;\n\nAbout Dahae's Chanel incident, it seems really tone-deaf of her in that situation but it could also be that she wanted to lighten the mood. I am just glad of how she took it well when Chansol confronted her. I think they wouldn't have much power imbalance but I think it might be an uphill battle. I wish that her chaebol family is nice though. I have seen many dramas and do not know very affluent families and they are not very nice in most I've watched. \ud83d\ude06\n\nAlso, their decision at that time may differ in the long run but I'm rooting for the endgame couples to last.\n\nEpilogue comments:\n\n* It's funny how the formed couples really break their own preferences while some look a bit foolish.\n* Dahae in full Chanel jewelry in that interview is just hilarious after having that incident. She must really like the brand!",

When she showed up at the house she had shorter, light-brown hair, with a very conservative cut.  Almost matronly.  I'm wondering if the PDs asked her to come in a bit more mature and somber, to make her secret appear just that much more dramatic and scandalous.",

Just glad that this is already over, so I can move on to other shows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts on the ending (may contain spoilers !!!):\n\n\\- I actually felt Seulbi's sincerity when she cried watching Bareum's secret reveal. First off, I was shocked at her reaction. But I thought, as she acted that way, Seulbi is not as bad with the way she treats Bareum. It made me look at her in a different (good) way. Nevertheless, &gt;!I still think Bareum deserves a total queen. But I will cheer for Bareum all the way whether or not he is with Seulbi.!&lt;\n\n\\- Not at all surprised by Haneul's decision. I really really admire her for what she did. She is an incredible human. &gt;!Hanu and Taeyang are just not the types of guys who could fit what Haneul is probably looking for in a partner. It is a huge responsibility (having a child) and she needs someone who would not only be able to understand it but also who is mature and selfless enough.  !&lt;I am happy Haneul made the decision she did.\n\n\\- Chansol and Dahae ending up as a couple are what everyone is expecting. I wish them the best.\n\n\\- I just love and adore seeing Hanui and Daon in this final episode. I can feel the genuine friendship that these two built with each other. &gt;!They may have ended up alone but leaving from the show as friends is a whole another level of special.!&lt;",

Since ep 11 I can see that she was passive when talking to Hanu or TY, it shows that she already decided she did not want to pick either of them.\n\nI hope 2nd season will have longer period for the casts to stay in the house considering there were lost/missed opportunities for the casts to build relationships due to the 12 days limit. And there were very little time for them to have a one on one conversations outside the dates without being disturbed by others.",

Rooting for her to find someone kind and loving like she deserves.!&lt;\n\n* Seulbi &gt;! chosing Bareum was such a twist but good for them! Rooting for this couple !&lt;\n\n* Hangyeol\u2019s reaction to Hanui\u2019s secret was shitty but idk that Hanu and Taeyang were that nice either. They seemed like they were being non prejudiced just cause they\u2019re on camera and because they had and have zero romantic feelings towards Hanui anyway, so it doesn\u2019t affecr them. Had either of them developed any kind of connection with her I doubt they would\u2019ve reacted so cooly. This is just the impression I have of them as guys. Especially Hanu, who considered Daon a fox just for exploring her options the way he did.\n\n* Also, I found it really interesting what Heechul said about Daon and Hanu being ex idols and how that meant they were used to receiving a lot of love and attention. I never clocked this before but it really makes sense in this semi \u2018entitlement\u2019 they have towards being chased and flirting with everyone. \n\n* Dahae\u2019s little chanel bag moment was really tone deaf and awkward, the rest of them were just like \ud83d\ude2c I don\u2019t really see her and Chansol lasting long.\n\n* I still think if I was Hanui I would sue the show cause the lies were not at all matched in levels of seriousness lol. She risked so much to walk away with nothing.",

The secret with the most social consequences, and the only one nobody had any interest in- it just felt like unnecessary torture exposing her secret in front of everybody. And after everybody else as well, just in case there was any doubt who had the 'worst' secret. I couldn't focus on other's secrets bc I was feeling second hand dread from her. \n\nBad vibes from Hanu all the way around. He just made himself look like such an asshat. Hanui's unending devotion for him was tragic- her heartfelt message was painful. \n\nHangyeol also had a vibe I didn't like, but not bad specifically. Just wishy-washy and a little cold/distant imo. Dahae could've been really charming, but knowing what we know, she comes off as bratty- a rich girl with a YT channel who didn't take a dating show even remotely seriously? /yawn\n\nAnyway, I liked pretty much everyone else in their own way. Haneul was very likable. Chansol and Bareum were simply the best boys. Taeyang came across as very sincere and likable, although perhaps not in the context of a dating reality show.\n\nThe warnings on Disney+ are a little puzzling.

Called both.\n* Seulbi would just pick Bareum. It's a show. She wants to be seen in a nice light. Bareum is the hero of this show.\n* The women just want the show to be over- Haneul being the most obvious one in this episode. Not only did she just want to go back to her daughter, she's had enough of these guys and their shenanigans. Sending the last message to Hanu and then choosing Hangyeol? Hangyeol was 100% a 'spoil the vote' pick for her. \n* Dahae and Chansol were a sure thing.\n\nBut I did learn some things.\n\n* Dahae is so well brought up. Chansol sending criticism to her and her liking it? Wow. The whole show she's been the voice of reason for all the other girls- she really can connect with people. Kudos.\n* Bareum leaves as the winner as well. His image, his pedigree, and just overall how nice he is. For him to text Chansol? What a move, especially when he was still worried about Hangyeon and Seulbi! \n* Chansol too, is so grounded. I like how he called out Dahae- he really has to show her what he thinks now, and not when it's too late.\n* ... and maybe it's no coincidence that these are the people who walked away with a match.\n\nWill there be a season 2? I'm not sure. This one kinda ended with a whimper. How much more surprising can you actually get from here? I feel they'll have to totally reinvent the concept for this to work well, or maybe do it like some other dating shows (eg Too Hot To Handle), and basically bluff the cast that they're on a different show.",

I am so glad she did not fall for it. \n\nHanu and TY reactions to being rejected was simply another proof that none of them really had feelings about her. Laughing, hugging, making jokes. We were right to think that they were using her as a pride rebound / rivalry prize. She deserves so much better.\n\nAnd Haneul probably picked HangYeol because the producers asked her to chose someone. She 100% thought she was not going to be picked and obviously did not care at all. \n\n2/ It was a great show but I hope that for next season: production choses candidates who have comparable secrets in terms of gravity. The situation was disproportionately disadvantageous for Hanui here. \"I am a hairdresser\" \"I am a freelance weatherperson\" \"I am 10 years older than announced\" - so ridiculous and unfair for Hanui. Just don't accept her in the show if all the other secrets are so minor. \n\n3/ HangYeol having to chose between Daon and Hanui, without Seulbi in the room, was a total spoiler that he was going to reject them and go chose Seulbi. Otherwise, there would have put the 3 women in the room. It was a little bit obvious that the panel pretended to be stressed and surprised, which ruins things a little bit. Still a good show though. \n\n4/ I can't share general happiness for Bareum here, I think Seulbi is a really bad match for him. He is overly generous and she seems sneaky. I hope I am wrong\n\n5/ Last but not least: I love Chansol and Dahae but I truly believe their couple has no chance to work. PLease contradict me and prove me I am wrong, I need hope here",

I was fine with Hanuel not choosing either Hanu or Taeyang but her going to HG made me mad\u2026 idk he\u2019s the worst. He\u2019s a bad friend and would be a bad partner.

I lost all of my hobbies as well and barely have time for myself. Wish her and Soi all the best for their future. She deserves the best!\n\n- Bareum is totally husband materials. He is family oriented, responsible, have a stable job, work hard, smart and sincere. I am not sure if Seulbi chose him because he is the best guy there or she actually had any romantic feelings for him as a man. Wish him all the best anyways!\n\n- I love Chansol and Dahae couple. I hope they can work things out in reality, Chansol is a keeper as well, decent gentleman. Dahae will grow so much as a person if she is together with him.\n\n- The only secret that is soooo lame is Hangyeol\u2019s. His age was actually an advantage, not something he should lie about. Most of the girls looked at him in more favourable light after the reveal.\n\n- I hope that all the casts, the people that had gone through a lot in life, especially Hanui, can find their happiness after the show.",

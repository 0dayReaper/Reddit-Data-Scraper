But after a couple of episodes, I am pleansantly surprised at how well Na In Woo meshed with this group!\n\nAnyway, my next worry is the departure of Smiley PD... I hope the show is still enjoyable for me without her direction.",

And personally imo, he was a bit lost when Ravi left the show and they were only 5 of them, the void was huge and to add on that, Lee PD kept separated the members, with In woo being the one who got separated the most so it didn't help eith their bonding.\n\nBut I'm glad, I think becoming 6 members again does the magic, In woo is no longer the maknae and it fits him more tbh. Adding YSH to the casts is seriously a right decision",

            "comment": "It always takes time for a new cast member to gel with the group. There was a minor goof with keeping In-Woo with the YB's too long, but Bang PD made a point of mixing him in after that, which helped.\n\nLee PD is more camera shy than Smiley, so other PD's seem to be getting more screen time. He is less inclined to use huge props the way Bang PD did, but that's closer to old school S1. (Here's some bottle caps and a table- Be FUNNY!) \n\nThe biggest issue I have with Lee PD is that he kept repeating a mistake that Na PD made in late S1 when they didn't know how to handle a cast of 5, and separated them all. (Spoiler- there were a series of episodes where the goal seemed to be &gt;!Let's send Na In-Woo to the furthest place possible from the rest of the boys.!&lt;)",

But I did notice once seonho (who is the youngest and has had moments with the other cast members despite the huge age difference), Na Inwoo has now become more out there and has find his own character therefore, making him funny without trying as hard. So now I\u2019m cool with him.",

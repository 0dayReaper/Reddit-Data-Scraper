    "postText": "Hello! I am new to the sub but not to korean variety shows. But sadly i only limited myself to running man, i live alone and occasional The manager ( which i wierdly feel is just another version of i live alone) but they both have same broadcaster maybe thats probably okay. \nI tried return of superman, my little old boy, but lost interest. I watched all of youn's kitchen, stay seasons.I tried 2 days 1 night but it didn't hold my interest. \nWatched some i am solo, but again didnt hold up.\n\nBut after all this, i do realize that korean variety has so much to offer. And i dont want to miss out. \n\nMy fav so far is the old running man ( from Ep 100 to 250). I live alone.\n\nI am really excited about the upcoming show which has celebs experiencing different jobs of high profile. Or something like that ( bad memory, sorry)\n\nI actually enjoy unique show concepts and dont prefer too much talking. \n\nI really wanted to try where's my house ( it has Miss Park na rae as host), but sadly, it's not available anywhere, not even subbed anywhere.\n\nSo maybe i wanna start with house hunting theamed shows. Please recommend. If not, those any fun and unique shows are appreciated. \n\nThank you so much.",

So basically iheartu2 will either mention a link to find those obscure dating shows. Or iheartu2 will actually sub it themselves but this can take over months, so just be patient.\n\nFor Love Alarm: Clap! Clap! Clap! (\uc88b\uc544\ud558\uba74 \uc6b8\ub9ac\ub294 \uc9dd!\uc9dd!\uc9dd!), apparently the English/etc. subs are on Dailymotion.\n\nA list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and Kdramas, East Asian films, et cetera, and more info on where to watch them: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/12qlu3e/its_just_my_impression_or_the_are_really_few/jgqusuv/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/12ccjku/can_someone_give_me_a_list_of_korean_variety/jf16a56/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/12bduuc/new_offbrand_terrace_house_set_to_start_this_may/jewxvfh/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10yej01/singles_inferno_confirmed_to_return_for_season_3/j7zqw31/\n\n---\n\nMore info on ArmsAsuncion's website for redditors (it has East Asian dating/variety/etc. shows, Kdramas/Jdoramas/Cdramas/et cetera), tteokbeokkisubs/noonaspoiler, adblock, VPNs, and so on: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/10fpzhx/overall_thoughts_on_love_catcher_in_bali/j5cmhaw/\n\nThis thread has the different names of streaming/OTT services (like TVING, Coupang Play, wavve, etc.) or websites and the various Youtube channels and links for where to watch some of these dating shows: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/yktjg9/can_anyone_suggest_some_kdating_shows/iuvbg43/\n\n---\n\nCheck MyDramaList too for a more visual list of these East Asian variety shows, dating shows, dramas, et cetera.

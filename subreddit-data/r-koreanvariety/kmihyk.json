I am really appreciative of the fact that he always does this as he knows the industry has lost someone who is well-loved by the people around her.  \n\nIt's really saddening to have an elder do multiple send off for his juniors, Jaesuk's words reflect on how he truly feels and I bet it is the same for his colleagues as well.",

He\u2019s rightfully a role model for people because he is just a wonderful human. I love that he\u2019s been consistently honouring those who have passed in the industry because it acknowledges them and let them not be forgotten as just news of the day but also raises awareness of the industry problems once again which is something I am sure as an entertainer he also experiences here and there. Sometimes I do worry for the k-entertainers as they work so hard to make others laugh (often at their own expense) but also hiding their struggles. I really respect them and I admire Jaesuk\u2019s (and other senior comedians) constant support for the industry as a whole and also for his junior comedians as he has mentioned the need for more opportunities for them. \n\nAnyways congratulations to Jaesuk and a wel deserved win as always!!",

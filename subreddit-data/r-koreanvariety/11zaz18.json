    "postText": "While waiting for the official cast prediction that the production team might release, I think it's fun to have our own prediction!\n\nThe Idol Role: Looking at the pattern, I think they rather cast a woman rather than a man for this. While EXID Hani and Apink Eunji could be recasted, I think they always want someone new in this role. The ones that have potential, for me, are ex-IOI Kim Se-jeong (have acting experience and is also the main cast for Busted! in 3 seasons. Witty to an extent as well.) and G-idle Yuqi (her stint in the YouTube series Learn Way is appealing)\n\nThe Assertive Queen Role: No one could contest this role, as Park Jiyoon always delivers perfectly season by season; she could openly nag, debate and argue with anyone. But after watching High School Mystery Club, I think Jaejae could steal the role if she wants to.\n\nThe Comedian Role: Jang Dongmin played the role superbly by being someone that always suspected everyone because they couldn't measure what he was thinking, and Yang Sehyung did his best, I think they could find a new one for a change of pace. My 2 picks are Earth Arcade's Lee Eunji (Comedienne with several famous roleplay characters, including Psick Univ's Y2K series Gil Eunji, etc.) and Kwon Hyuksoo (SNL Korea Comedian who is also experienced in roleplay)\n\nThe Elder Role: Director Jangjin, with his famous Pythagorean Deduction(?), always surprise people with his theories. There aren't many options for this role as older people (for lack of a better word) are not interested much in mystery IMO. But if they remove the role, I think one of the Problematic Men's cast could take over the cast slot.\n\nFree-for-All Role: With Hong Jinho's straightforward method and Kim Jihoon's versatility, I think there is no defined description for this role. But I feel like we need someone less-energetic and grumpy like Kim Gura, and the only one who fits those characteristics is Actor Joo Woo Jae.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dream guests are Kai (who recently embraced variety gigs), any real detectives/profilers (it's nice to hear their opinions on the game design), previous casts (if they aren't main cast, including Jang Dongmin, Hong Jinho, etc.).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow about you, guys?",

            "comment": "Tbh, Joo Woo Jae has been shown way too much in Korean variety when he hasn't been all that entertaining. I would love to see more interactions between Yang SeHyung and Jang Dongmin. For the free-for-all role, I would suggest Lee Dong Wook. He has experience in variety, has close friends that are comedians, and is a stellar actor. While Joo Woo Jae has shown he is intellectual, it's like he has a switch. He can't combine comedy with logic. It's either one or the other.",

            "comment": "I agree, Jiyoon, Jinho and Dongmin are must haves on this cast. They are some of my faves. I am hoping the idol role goes to Yena. She is a great variety character and she was on the panel for Bloody Game. Even though she didn\u2019t add too much there, she has some association to this kind of show and can shine here.",

            "comment": "I'm pretty sure Park Jiyoon will gonna be recasted, it's basically became her signature show! I will be glad if they have Jinho or Dongmin too though.\n\nFor the Idol Role, I am really hoping it'll be Choi Yena. I'm such a fan of Yena and she's literally the 4th gen rising entertainer but judging her deduction skills on GHSMC, she will do poor on the show lmao. But I'll be glad also if she'll be guesting. Since Yena was not that skilled, I'm going with Lee Mijoo. If they really wanted a 4th gen female idol, then IVE's Yujin and (G)I-DLE's Yuqi were not that bad too!\n\nMy dream guests would be Jaejae, SEVENTEEN's Seungkwan or Mingyu, Jang Doyeon, Lee Dohyun and Shin Yeeun \u263a\ufe0f",

            "comment": "Maybe Eom Ji-yoon. She is rising comedian very witty, intelligent and very good impersonating skills.\n\nI think very interesting choice would be as well Park Jihoon. He seems to not like actually variety shows and avoid them. Still he is famous in Korea through Produce. He is known as one of the best video games players among idols, has good acting skills and poker face with cute elements. I think that could be entertainment and fresh mix with him being awkward at variety shows. Especially that it is open secret that he has totally different real character than his image suggest.\n\nI feel that Lee Jin-ho could be good choice as well. He seems to be generally very knowledgeable and at the same type kind lazy type. He is also very intelligent, witty. In knowing bros he says less than rest but his comments always hit the nail on the head.\n\nEx Wanna one Jisung could be option as well. He is type who like to gossip, watch a lot tv. And he can talk very fast while arguing.\n\nAnd lastly I think show need someone who can play well \"mollayo\" guy like Kim Jong-min. I think especially 3rd season lacked in this aspect, everyone seemed to too good in their job. Yang Se-hyung seemed to be chosen for that \"strange deduction\" guy but he wasn't really but he wasn't really convincing.",

My dream guest is Jisoo, she's incredibly smart and loves reading which not many people know about her. I would love to see her thought process and deductions. Also Hani if she is not a main cast member.",

However, if he were to find himself in a country on the other side of the world where they don\u2019t know anything about Korean food, will he be able to run a business and survive? In a place where he doesn\u2019t speak the language and has no popularity to rely on, he must build a business from the ground up. Nothing is scripted and everything is one-hundred percent real. Will Paik Jong Won be able to reach world-class fame with his food business? The story of the Business Genius\u2019 new store opening begins now.\n\nCast:\n\n* Baek Jong Won\n* Lee Jang Woo\n* John Park\n* Yuri\n* BamBam\n\n|Info/Torrent|Streaming|Subs|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|[720p-NEXT](https://torrentsee166.com/topic/310651)|[VIU](https://www.viu.com/ott/sg/en/vod/2172975/The-Genius-Paik)|[720p-NEXT](https://www.mediafire.com/file/b28udgco59a26jx/%25EC%259E%25A5%25EC%2582%25AC%25EC%25B2%259C%25EC%259E%25AC_%25EB%25B0%25B1%25EC%2582%25AC%25EC%259E%25A5.E10.230604.720p-NEXT.srt/file)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

As always, I would love to eat whatever chef Baek makes haha. \n\nJohn suggestion of adding two more tables was smart as well. He's really good. They're truly the avengers team, the part timers included. I expected the Naples segment to only be 2 episodes but we're already far past that. I guess the first country didn't do as well as expected that's why they didn't have enough good(?) footage.",

Bruh, Yuri, think about all those 50-80 year old aunties running restaurants and food bars all day long. You're out here complaining that being in the sun for 15 minutes burnt you out and a lunch service has you wiped out? :O \n\nThis and it looks like next episode are the \"upper class Seoulites\" having to work a full working class day as a service industry employee and whining about it and wanting to stop while customers are lined outside. I imagine it won't exactly be a great look in SK as the gen pop working class watches the show. \n\nThe one thing I was wondering, this episode is the first time anyone has mentioned SNSD if I remember correctly. We've never had a customer recognize Yuri or mention SNSD, which I find to be wild. Does no one recognize her? It's not that I think everyday Italians would, not that at all, but a lot of people going to the restaurant seem to be familiar with SK, K-food and K-entertainment. I wonder if they are just editing out all \"omg it's Yuri from SNSD!\" and \"can we get a picture with Yuri?\" for the show.",

But when you're not even a week in, you've been doing half days (not breakfast through dinner but just a lunch service or just a single dinner service), and when your job is to just set plates and put banchan on the trays at your station, you're not exactly mining coal. \n\nThere's reason to be tired. There's reason for their feet to hurt. But their day was still a just a lunch service and I'm saying the optics, fit, 30 years old, celebrity getting totally burnt out and complaining about wanting to end while customers are outside (and by the teaser, bailing on work the next day in protest) when this is the reality of the struggling working class who can't just whine and bail... I'm just wondering if that will get criticized in SK or not. \n\nNo matter what country it is, it typically doesn't go over well when \"rich famous celeb does a normal blue collar job and complains about being exhausted and wanting it to end when they've been doing it a few days and at like 70% workload\". So I'm curious if that will get picked up on or not in SK. That's all.",

Which was exactly my point, SK has a ton of aunties and uncles in their 50's-80's doing exactly that. No complaints, just hard working. \n\nAlso I specifically didn't mention John, seeing as how as a \"mid fielder\" he was walking a ton, burning through mental energy speaking 3 languages and serving food to the customers. Him being exhausted is very easy to understand. Yuri behind the counter building banchan and setting the dishes on the trays? Not as much. \n\n\"Brutal\" is not a word I'd use lightly like you are. Like I said, this isn't coal mining. This isn't working a Wok in a 100F kitchen for 9 hours a day. Jang Woo was rinsing bowls and meat with 3 ladles of broth and then ladling in the final amount and setting it down for service to get. Then, occasionally, he was making the final broth by combining from the other broths. Not exactly what I would call high intensity, back or brain melting, or as you'd say \"brutal\" work. If anything I'd hate to be Paik, bent over standing and cutting meat for how many hours straight? He is by far the oldest and he had the second hardest job behind John.",

Most small restaurants don\u2019t have this turnover rate. Also why are you singling her out most of the time when Jangwoo also struggled?\n\nEdit: When the turnover rate is of a normal restaurant they were doing fine. Even the show itself is trying to highlight greed and how there needs to be balance. As even the real part timers were at their limit. I think they asked before last episode Paik set a limit of how many more customers he would take. The sudden influx of customers isn\u2019t normal at all and it is partly due to their fame.",

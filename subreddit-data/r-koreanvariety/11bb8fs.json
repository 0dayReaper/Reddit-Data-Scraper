    "postText": "I just want to praise the staff for hiring Yoo Seon Ho because he is honestly comedy gold to me. It\u2019s so funny to watch how gullible and clumsy he is. I thought the first few episodes would feel awkward since the older member like Jung hoon, din-din, and se yoon are pretty shy, but there wasn\u2019t really any awkward tensions after the first episode. The first episode wasn\u2019t even that awkward honestly \ud83d\ude05 I really like the chemistry between everyone, and it\u2019s making me sad to think that I woo is probably gonna leave soon for military. I love In woo, but I wonder why the writer hired him when he was close to military enlistment age and he was gonna leave soon after ravi left this 2022. I hope they wait for in woo to come back \ud83d\ude05",

Jongmin was amazing and Seonho completely fell for his act hahhaha\n\nIn Woo's character completely changed once Seonho joined the cast. He's become so funny. The show also got better once the production stopped splitting them up.",

I would\u2019ve got into trouble with my sister if I watched it before bedtime (which I would usually do) because we share the same room, I\u2019m sure my laughter would wake up, I\u2019m usually good at keeping my laugh but that episode was gold! I can\u2019t stop laughing out loud while watching Jongmin betray Seonho \ud83d\ude02",

I wonder why though when they only had 5 members before seon ho so it\u2019s kind of a weird number to split people up. I\u2019m super excited to see seon ho in the wilderness or like in an island during the summer or spring. I have a feeling it\u2019s gonna be funny how clueless he will be \ud83d\ude02",

Maybe I'm a bit biased because he is the youngest cast member on the show, but he's just so cute \ud83e\udd27\n\nS4 really hit a stride in 2021 but with all the cast changes, it's been flaking. 2D1N biggest strength is cast chemistry but with an ever revolving cast, that doesn't work. The intro of Seon Ho really revived the show and I do hope they keep this traction even when In Woo leaves. \n\nAlso with In Woo's casting, it's definitely because of his reputation. When they were looking for Seon Ho #1's replacement, they were basically like \"Ok who has the *squeakiest* record possible?\" In Woo got famous for his dedication with re-recording River Where The Moon Rises so his casting was a really popular choice and was praised a lot by netizens.",

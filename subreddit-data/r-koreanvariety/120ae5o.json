Considering he isn\u2019t acquainted to them before this show, he adjusted and mesh well with the others. I wonder what goes on behind the scenes if there are fights lol Zico was complaining that the snow has gotten to his mouth (and I was holding my breath in case he was really pissed tho Indoubt they\u2019d show that on cam) and Youngjin had to wear vintage shop clothes without a jacket previously.",

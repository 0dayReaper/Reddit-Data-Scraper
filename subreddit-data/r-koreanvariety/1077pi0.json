    "postText": "I'm quite new to dating shows. I enjoyed Love Transit 2 and watched its first season after. I'm also enjoying Skip Dating as I find it hilarious\u2014 despite the singles being awkward for half the episode\u2014 because of its hosts. On the other hand, I paused Pet Me Pick Me and Pink Lie because I got bored in the later episodes (the first episodes for these two were strong to attract me, though).\n\nI really enjoy watching Love Catcher Season 4 or Love Catcher in Bali. Some of the reasons I loved about it were:\n\n* The whole money and love catcher concept were interesting.\n* Most of the members seem mature and are very decisive people, they know what they want and who they're going after, but are also wary of the other members and their feelings. But that's probably because of the show's concept. \n* Everyone seemed to respect each other's boundaries, even towards their rivals. \n* There's no one in the house I'm uncomfortable watching. &gt;!There's a cheesy guy that was really sussed out to be a MC, someone who cowers when their rival appears near their love interest, someone who keeps approaching someone although they're clearly not interested, and someone who kept trying to pull the obvious couple apart from each other.!&lt; But, that's just about it and no major red flags.\n* Soo Roo - Tae Eun\n\nThe only ick I have about this season is the obvious bias the panel is showing, but for the most part, I can just ignore them.\n\nLove Catcher 4 is about to end and I'm thinking of watching Seasons 1-3. Is it worth it? or should I skip particular seasons? \n\nThank you!",

All the connections felt kind of shallow, even from the love catchers, and way too much over-analyzing of the smallest gestures by the editing/commentators. I wouldn't be surprised if some people watched s1 and didn't bother to watch the others because of it. Watch it if you have nothing else to watch I guess lol, but s2 and LC in Seoul were better (and Bali is the best imo!).",

Some people don't like the third season, Love Catcher in Seoul (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \uc11c\uc6b8), and so they'll say to skip it, but almost everyone agrees that Love Catcher 2 is legendary.\n\nTry to watch Love Catcher in Seoul, it kinda has really nice visuals, like Love Catcher in Bali.\n\n---\n\n**A list of other Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows and more info on where to watch them: https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/1076jds/good_dating_shows/j3kxjmx/**\n\nOverview about shows like Single's Inferno, Heart Signal (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110), Terrace House, Shanghai Sharelife, Love Catcher (Love Catcher in Bali (\ub7ec\ube0c\uce90\ucc98 \uc778 \ubc1c\ub9ac) and Love Catcher 2), and Pink Lie (\ud551\ud06c \ub77c\uc774), also EXchange/Transit Love (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc560): https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/106wwu2/they_should_have_a_korean_show_similar_to_love/j3k9pa0/?context=10000 and https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/106wwu2/they_should_have_a_korean_show_similar_to_love/j3kba2u/\n\n**Check MyDramaList too for a more visual list of these dating shows**.

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been into Korean music and tv shows for around 15 years and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just growing out of them or if they just stopped being enjoyable because they\u2019ve been on air for so long (Running Man, Little Old Boy, Knowing Brothers).\n\nSo I need some recommendations I currently like watching Let\u2019s Play Soccer 2, Hangout with Yoo, Love Naggers, and I am Solo.\n\nI understand Korean about 50-60% so shows that aren\u2019t subtitled are fine but if you know any that are fully subbed I\u2019d appreciate it.",

Season 2 I stopped watching because it lost its charm even though kwang soo was there and that was the reason I started the show in the first place.\n\nIf you like the soccer show I can recommend unnies are running, it's an all female basketball team. It sadly has only 14 episodes.",

For me s2 lost its charm a bit because of the size of the shop, they are too busy maintaining the supermarket, less interaction between them and the folks. Luckily the business slowed down during the night, more chit chats during the night snack bar portion.\n\nTheres rumour that they going to film s3 this autumn, i hope they came back to small rural shop.",

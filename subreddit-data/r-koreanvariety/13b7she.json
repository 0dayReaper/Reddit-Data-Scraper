    "postText": "Greetings, \n\nI am curious what **key features** and **locations** come to mind when you think of your favourite variety shows and characters?\n\n**Are there any locations that really stand out as memorable?**  \n**Which landmarks do you instantly associate with K-Variety when you see them?**\n\n**What features, themes, games and other elements do you like about your favourite shows?**\n\nI ask because I am working on a fun little project that incorporates some of the common recurring elements of variety shows to create a fun experience for other K-Variety fans.\n\nIn order to create a convincing \"K-Variety\" theme for this project I have been trying to distil K-Variety into its core building blocks.\n\nFor older shows PD's would often include an opening dance battle and the older Running Man &amp; Infinite Challenge episodes would regularly expose viewers to distinctly Korean landmarks. \n\nAs a regular K-Variety viewer I have grown accustomed to certain patterns shared across programmes regardless of the age of the show, pd, cast or show type. \n\nSome of the signature features of K-Variety I can think of include captions, pop up text, jingles, icons and logos. \n\n  \nOther memorable elements include signature soundtracks for shows, characters and individual cast members. \n\nOlder variety shows often had a heavy reliance on guests - including but not limited to actors, idols and comedians. \n\n**Who are some of your favourite guests or characters?**   \n\n\n**What makes them fun and memorable to you?**\n\nFor longer running variety shows you often see the cast of characters return to familiar sets and locations.\n\nRegular featured landmarks I can think of are things like the SBS,KBS and MBC broadcasting stations as well as \"filming lots\" for popular shows such as the I Live Alone studio. \n\n**What other elements of Korean Variety shows do you enjoy and why?** \n\nI appreciate any and all replies and look forward to sharing my project here when it is finished. \n\nI wish you all a pleasant day!",

            "comment": "I mostly watch game/action based shows like 2d1n, running man (older eps), great escape etc, so will talk about my top threes here. \n\nI prioritize cast chemistry and fun games that make me actually laugh out loud. \n\nKey feature I like most: how the crew randomly appears on screen with the cast. Some of my favorite variety moments include cast-crew interactions. \n\n2d1n made me realize how beautiful South Korea is, with so many scenic places, their unique culture, history and mouth watering foods. \n\nWhile most shows are prize based, 2d1n is unique because it's all about avoiding the penalties. Crazy how seeing the cast being penalized be actually funny, and their antics while trying to avoid so are funnier. \n\nI like great escape for its detailed execution of interesting concepts and the unexpectedness. I am mostly blown away by jjy pd's creativity and the technical team's ability. \n\nI liked rm for its variety of fun concepts and the most perfect cast (old cast, 7 members). Like the name tag ripping segment can get boring at times and the randomness of the cast saves it for me. \n\nMemorable locations: Even though I am not a Korean, the 2d1n s3 episode shot in the border of North Korea, panmunjom (I still remember the name!) touched me the most. This show introduced to many beautiful places but this particular location remained memorable for me. \n\nLandmarks: obviously the broadcasting stations kbs and sbs. \n\nGuests: Most of my favorite guest episodes is from rm. Their competitiveness brings out their unexpected fun and witty sides. \n\nGames: Interesting that simple or even recycled games across various variety shows can be still fresh and fun with different casts in different shows. The most memorable one is spot the fake food version with kim jong min in 2d1n s3. \n\nTldr: I like the randomness, unscripted feels of korean variety show. I love the friendly bonds among the cast and crew. \n\nHave fun with your project!",

                    "comment": "Thanks for your detailed and descriptive reply.\n\nSome great thoughts and insights to ruminate on.\n\nI'm also very fond of game based variety shows and its a shame that the current trends seem to be moving away from this structure recently.\n\nI am sure things will come full circle again at some point but there does seem to be a noticeable lull in this kind of show at the moment.\n\nI arrived late to the party for some of the shows you have mentioned and I struggle to maintain viewership with some of them as I am not so invested and familiar with the cast chemistry as you mention.\n\nI often find revisiting shows I'm unsure of on first viewing sometimes helps me to warm up the the casts I am less \"comfortable\" with.\n\nRandom crew/cast interactions can be very enjoyable - I remember watching some of the older running man camera crew interactions and comraderie and that aspect of variety shows can be very enjoyable to witness.\n\nPrizes &amp; Penalties certainly add an element of suspense and tension to watching the shows.\n\nSome of the penalties can be very fun to watch and I definitely agree that the danger element they introduce adds an element of excitement to the shows.\n\nCrucially, it gives the cast something to orchestrate jokes and gags around and build action, tension and comedic releases into the shoots.\n\nI need to give great escape another shake as I've watched a few episodes and enjoyed them but bounced off of it a few times as well.\n\nI do think those high concept, high-stakes and high production shows bring something different to the table.\n\nFor guests I sometimes recognise actors or comedians from other shows or dramas but as I primarily consume variety content more than idol or drama content I dont always recognize the \"talent\" but often still find aspects to enjoy from their variety characters and ocassionally check out their actual main body of work if they leave a lasting impression.\n\nI think that original promotion aspect of guest appearances has largely shifted to other mediums such as YouTube - in shows like Game Caterers. Unfortunately, I think that means there's less opporunity for new variety stars to shine.\n\nI often enjoy YouTube style shows as well - Na Pd's recent Comic Bros episodes were wholesome and fund!\n\nPretty excited for Earth Arcade Season Two as well.\n\nI agree about the randomness and \"unscripted\" feel of the shows - although I do find it somewhat suprising how different some personas can be compared to their variety characters when actually off script.\n\nI miss some of the grander sets and games from the older Running Man and Infinite Challenge projects and it would be nice to see a new show with a similar game based format and high production values appear in the future.\n\nOften the simple and straight-forward games are the most memorable but I do have a soft spot for games so overly complicated the cast cant immediately understand them and as such make all sorts of mistakes as they go!\n\nThanks again for your great reply and I'll be sure to share more as I get closer to completing the first pass on my project.",

                            "comment": "&gt;I am sure things will come full circle again\n\nI wish the same. I miss fun chaos and slapstick surrounding silly games in my variety shows.\n\n&gt;Random crew/cast interactions can be very enjoyable -\n\n2d1n s1 normalized it, before that crew always stayed behind the camera. Another fun fact, the same show also revived and increased domestic tourism in sk.\n\n&gt;I need to give great escape another shake\n\nYou probably won't regret. It has a perfect balance of captivating storyline, interesting puzzles and fun camaraderie among the cast. First few episodes are escape room games and rest are story based and interconnected. \n\n&gt;For guests I sometimes recognise actors or comedians from other shows or dramas\n\nMost of the time it's opposite for me, I look up their works if I find them enjoyable in the shows. Even from the main casts, I found out about cha Tae hyun, Lee seungi, Lee kwang soo, Lee sang yeob - okay, 90% of the actors lol - from the shows. \n\n2d1n is again exceptional here as none of guests (except in s4) guested for promotion. Rather they were randomly invited by the casts. Such guest appearances were fun. \n\n&gt;Na Pd's recent Comic Bros\n\nThanks for mentioning, I enjoy na pd shows. \n\n&gt;although I do find it somewhat suprising how different some personas can be compared to their variety characters when actually off script\n\nAh, they are not completely unscripted or the casts are always in their raw selves. Like Moon seyoon himself said that he is totally different offscreen and quite shy and quiet around people. \n\n&gt;high production values appear in the futur\n\nThe production value of Great escape is even higher than most kdrama.",

Having caught up a bit more on Ask Us Anything and New Journey To The West I've come around to his style quite a bit.\n\nThe fun chaos aspect of some of the older shows definitely seems a bit lacking lately but at least Channel FullMoon consistently put out some fun content.\n\nBeat Coin is a bit more hot and cold but has some fun stuff from time to time.\n\nAlso curious to see what YJS YT team do in the future. \n\nThe Social Club feature felt like a mini pilot season for a show and it will be interesting to see if they try something of that nature again.\n\nWould be kinda cool if they work through different casts and concepts until they (hopefully) strike gold.\n\nHeres hoping Earth Arcade S2 keeps up the momentum from season one and we see some equally surprising stellar shows pop off out of nowhere!",

I have honestly never even thought about Mongolia before I saw it on the show - I found it really fascinated and started looking up stuff about the country and the culture. \n\nThe Sea of Hope bar \n\n\n**Which landmarks do you instantly associate with K-Variety when you see them?**\n\nI watch a lot of Kdrama and associate landmarks more with them than with K-variety. \n\nNot specific but I think I first learned about markets from shows like Amazing Saturday.\n\nAgain, not specific place, but I associate historical villages with variety. Even though I've seen some saeguk, my mind goes to K-variety first when I see a picture of a traditional house. (Note: But I associate hanbok with Kdrama.)\n\n\n**What features, themes, games and other elements do you like about your favourite shows?**\n\nTravel around to different destinations both within and outside the country\n\nInteraction with production team and cast (e.g. on Running Man)\n\nInteraction with normal citizens, people on the street (e.g. Running Man, Let's Eat Dinner Together)\n\nInteraction with kids (e.g. Hello Baby, the uncle episodes of Return of Superman) \n\nInteraction between celebrities - either those who might not normally interact or know each other (e.g. actors with idols) or that we get to be a fly on the wall of conversations between celebs who do know each other)\n\nGames - I like both the talky games and twists on physical games (e.g. foot volleyball, nametag ripping, etc.)\n\nSibling-like relationships between members (I'm not usually a fan of the love lines, though). E.g. the nicknames that the members have for each other on Running Man. \n\nLearning about celebrities' unexpected skills (e.g. Seol in Ah skateboarding on I Live Alone, Park Bo Young knowing how to work a cash register, etc.)",

Markets are certainly a key location I can work into my project and had actually forgotten to include on my list.  \n\n\nHistorical Landmarks are architectural styles are a good image to incorporate as well. Some of the patterns, materials and construction materials are distinctly korean in the same way that Hanbok is. \n\nWith regards to foreign locations and landmarks shown in K-Variety there are certainly a few that stick out for me - including some of the bungee jump locations and scenic mountain ranges.\n\nThe element of travel and being on the road is pretty crucial as well thanks for highlighing it. Although it's not a part of all K-Variety it does tend to add a sense of adventure to things when present.  \n\n\nIt does seem that lots of viewers share a fondness for the smaller more mundane interactions between staff, cast members, idols, celebrities and the general public.  \n\n\nI wonder what it is about these smaller, personal interactions that resonates with people?  \n\n\nI think the 'hotpot' nature of mixed casts from different walks of life is certainly a key appeal of variety shows. Seeing actors,ideals,comedians and overall \"characters\" in scenarios and situations they are not familiar with can lead to some very funny and heatwarming moments.  \n\n\nUnexpected skills and hidden talents is a great spot as well.  \n\n\nI think fly-on-the-wall and -twists on games we are familiar with is a great way to summarize some of the key appeal of core variety motifs.  \n\n\nThanks again for the input, definitely helpful in updating my research :)",

I watched my first k-variety show in 2019 but started watching much more during the pandemic. E.g. I remember watching Let's Eat Dinner Together episodes in March- May 2020. In my country, so many public places were shut down and many families and friends were only able to connect virtually. The idea of having dinner with loved ones - much less total strangers - seemed unreal. I think I still carry a bit of that feeling of the pandemic, except now it's more like, I have to make the most of the time I have.",

I have never felt the urge to watch the show from the start without JSM. I have seen her guest episodes from the pre 346 episode era, and maybe two or three other episodes because a favorite actor or actress was a guest but nothing more. Key feature I love? Jeon SoMin, and her relationship with the cast especially (in no particular order) YooMin (JaeSuk), KwangMin (KwangSoo), HaMin (Haha), KookMin (Jongkook) and her relationship with her best variety onscreen father, Sukjin. (SBS official YouTube channel calls Haha and SoMin as the father daughter, but on the show it's always Sukjin. I count both, and love both). \n\n- Sixth Sense: \n\nI've watched all of season 1 and season 2, and only the few episodes of season 3 where SoMin was a \"guest\". Key features? Yeah, same as above. And then the relationship and the ensemble too.",

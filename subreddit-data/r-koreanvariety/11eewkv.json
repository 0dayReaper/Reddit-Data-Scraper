Getting a new working show off the ground is way more difficult than running an established show and there is a sort of shortage of talent in the industry.",

They managed to do both shows when Kyuhyun enlisted, I was thinking PO\u2019s enlistment wont be a problem since Jaehyun was supposed to be joining them back too. I believe there were articles about Jaehyun coming back to NJTTW and they talk about it in Spring Camp too so Ive been expecting the new season ever since. But seeing Earth Arcade with the same format, it seems to me that they did not proceed with filming and decided to do an all-female version instead \ud83d\ude14 Ive been dying to know what\u2019s going on. Im a big fan! I feared PD Na dropped it especially when Jiwon started joining Master in The House but that\u2019s just me overthinking and I really do hope that\u2019s not the case. But it does look like there are internal issues they cant disclose.",

I think the staff are focused on Youn's Kitchen(?) which is being filmed overseas so I assume Kang's kitchen isn't a priority at the moment.",

I also haven't heard about them filming S3 after that.\n\nI also don't think we're gonna get another season of Kang's Kitchen (thou I would love it if they prove me wrong). I feel like the cast would prefer filming NJTTW since it's easier and doesn't require much of their labor (they're doing a hella lot of food preparations, which is the norm of Kitchen series).\n\nWhat I last heard thou is them releasing S2 of Earth Arcade, but based on the comments here, I don't think Na PD will be involved with the show now.",

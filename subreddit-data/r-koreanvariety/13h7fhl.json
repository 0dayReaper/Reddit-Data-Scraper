    "postText": "I have been praying over and over that a new season will come out. \nI have rewatched KHIS 2x this year alone and must have watched it over 15x now. \n\nI was so happy when Jinny's Kitchen started airing but it did not satisfy me. \nAnd now, I am so disappointed that it's Earth Arcade's season now. (But I am still watching, don't get me wrong.)\n\nHow about another hotel season, Na PD? Pleaseeee... Or a three meals a day. \n\nIs Cha-jumma and Hae Jin busy with their movie or drama projects? I haven't heard any news.",

I thought it was gonna heal the gap in my heart for KHIS but it didn\u2019t since CSW wasn\u2019t in it :-(",

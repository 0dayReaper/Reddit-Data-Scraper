            "comment": "\nThe **SONG cam** at the start of the episode; her playing peekaboo with the camera while in line at the airport, the excitement for her first plane trip while holding a spoon - her favorite accessory, and seeing her reactions to the air pressure when the plane took off.\n\nI love how Soul showed his affection for Song without any prompting from their parents. He fed her because 1) the parents were busy deboning fish and 2) she was asking for food.\n\nThe dance party at their accommodation was such a joy to watch.",

He's so lowkey tho that seeing him all pumped up with his female friend was too funny to watch.\n\nAnd the dance party! It looks too tiring but props to Haha for spending time and making fun memories with his kids.",

I might be misremembering, but isn\u2019t the oldest and longest-serving camera director on Running Man also a Kang Chan Hee? They\u2019re not the same person, are they? Obviously it\u2019s quite common in SK for people to share names, but assuming I have them right it\u2019s quite a coincidence for the most senior staffer on two of the biggest variety shows.",

It was basically rigged for him to win and appear much stronger than the rest.!&lt;\n\nSeeing all the girls swoon at the results of the obviously rigged match made me pretty frustrated. You don't need to be a physicist to &gt;!see no one was pulling directly against Kim Jin-Young!&lt;. It makes me question their judgement, and also lose faith in the authenticity of this show. It makes me feel like I'm watching overproduced American TV again.",

At the end of the day it is a reality show you signed up to watch so I'm not that bothered they kind of rigged it. But they clearly wanted him to win.\n\nIt's more fun to see the new guy picking girls than the other guys",

Energy level: new guy looked fresh from bath wtheck! while the other two were already exhausted fighting each other.\n\n2. Position: Flags were not placed in a perfect triangle. \n\nLast remark. After the new guy wins the match, the way he threw the flag was like \"its too easy\". The fuck's with that, you fight two tired people and act like \"this shit's nothing\". \n\nWell obviously if you're the new guy, you must not be embarassed by losing on your reveal right!?",

And because the guys had to face each other 1:1 and had to work VERY hard and struggled.. \nand then how the girls were all swoon about it and didnt even seem to realize it was rigged.. -__-\n\nI just hope behind the scenes everyone just knew and were not allowed to say so at least the guys know it\u2019s not them / their strength that made them lose.. lol.

He was a deeply frustrating and somewhat misogynistic dude who most likely got hate from the show.  I think however that at certain points, the producers did indeed give the contestants notes (like telling Daon that she forgot her charger on men's floor, only for her to overhear Hanu talking badly about her + encouraging Chanel girl to have a short fling with the hairdresser).",

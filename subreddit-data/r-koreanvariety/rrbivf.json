    "postText": "Legendary.\n\nEdit (correction): It is apparently his 8th Daesang at MBC alone. \n\nOther thoughts on the night: \n\n1. HDYP dominated. Glad Mijoo, Haha, Bongsun, and Junha all won something by the end of the night. \n\n2. Kim Jongkook is somewhere in South Korea rubbing his hands together in anticipation of making fun of Haha and Ji Sukjin on Running Man. \n\n3. Also happy for Sandara Park for winning an award, her first as an individual after 2NE1. Hope she appears on I Live Alone more often.\n\n4. Kim Jongmin being pleasantly surprised at winning his Popularity Award was a funny moment. He seemed confused at first. \n\n5. Haha is really good, even on live TV. He seemed the most natural out of all the presenters. Honestly a tad bit underrated for his wit and sense of humor.\n\n6. Kim Taeho saying goodbye after a long time at MBC was a bittersweet moment, he definitely was quite emotional and had trouble speaking for a bit. Excited to see what he can do with more creative freedom though. \n\n7. Really surprised and happy for Kian84 for winning Male Grand Prize, and he did a great job on his speech. Hopefully ILA gets back to its old self because it's been missing its normal charm since Lee Sieon left.\n\n[Source (in Korean, but you can click the \"A\" button near the top of the article to see a rough translation)](https://entertain.v.daum.net/v/20211230011605019)",

I am not sure how much contribution she had on king of masked singer, but I live alone shouldn\u2019t be mentioned. It rubs in the same way Song hye kyo was nominated for deasang for NWABU\u2026.",

[Here is my previous thread about ILA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/comments/qyitwt/reviving_ila_one_of_my_favorite_ever_korean)\n\nSandara Park's guest appearance was by far the best of this past year (at least, towards the end of the year, which award shows do reward more due to recency bias). Also, she won this award with her contributions to both shows. She is a regular panel member on King of Mask Singer. It is not surprising at all to see her win.\n\nAmong the guests that appeared on ILA, who stood out more this year and also contributed to another MBC show on a regular basis? There is no one else.",

Of course most of the guests are similar but hers was the most simple of all unlike Kim ji hoon or Lee je hoon, but For me the sole reason I am confused is, a 50 mins appearance should not be considered for an award or mentioned as it made it look like her contribution for ILA is significant which is far from truth.",

Also Lee Jihoon was on one episode, just like Sandara. Personally her guest appearance was by far the most refreshing and memorable. \n\nWhy would an MBC Award show not mention Sandara's appearance on an MBC tv show? Especially an appearance that boosted ratings by 2% from the previous week.",

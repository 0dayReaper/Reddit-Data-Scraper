            "comment": "this was a pretty fun episode, best in a while actually. i especially loved the fire making part and the discussions. what really shocked me was how all the arguments from the A side for the first discussion about which one was worse was about how the guy in B being an old-school romantic and how A is much worse because it's two cheaters; reminds me of that study done about cheating b/w men and women. iirc the study talked about how for women, it's much worse when the guy is cheating mentally, meaning its' the love aspect that's the worse betrayal whereas for men generally, it's the physical aspect (the having sex) part that is the worse transgression.\n\nfor these two situations, those who chose A were thinking mostly from a man's perspective and those who chose B were thinking mostly from a woman's perspective. that's super interesting seeing as the real victims here are the girls (the gf in A and both the friend and the crush in B who didn't know anything) but those who chose A was worse could only think about how sad it must be for the guy in B to not be able to express his love properly and how A by virtue of having two cheaters was automatically worse. if you look at the staff votes too (especially since most of the staff are men) those who chose A are almost all men whereas most of those who chose B are all women except for a few men.\n\nas a woman, I can't imagine in the first discussion, the B scenario AT ALL being romantic because it's the guy tricking and using a woman's feelings to justify his cowardice for not being able to confess to the girl he actually likes (likely because she would reject him, cuz otherwise he would just go for it).  A is also bad but at least it's the cheating guy being brutally honest to the girl he's cheating with. whether she wants to accept such a controlling cheating ass is on her to decide because she at the very least knows the situation.\n\nthe 2nd and 3rd discussions were also quite entertaining and obviously more light-hearted. despite my personal feelings regarding the 1st discussion, overall it was super enjoyable seeing them trying to have a discussion and them ultimately devolving into play fighting based on how easily they can identify with the opposite gender or their personal experiences. this ep was one of the liveliest in a while despite juk jae and beo being relatively quiet guests. hope the pd capitalizes on discussions like these whenever they have a less action-packed episode because it's so much fun just watching them banter and have a great time without the added pressure of needing to make up content if the game is boring.\n\nedit for typos and phrasing.",

I am sure theres the prettiest girl or most handsome guy we all like but know we have no shot at it but thats more like admiration or worship to me. Like some of the points made, he might realise or come to love the current gf more after some time. \n\nSecondly, its something only he knows, unless he suddenly decides to confess it, theres just no way she would get hurt because she wouldnt know. How is A being brutally honest when hes doing it behind his gf's back.",

                            "comment": "Ok, I understand where you're coming from. I can accept it **if** it's surface level infatuation, his gf is kinda aware about B's feelings and B is not actively looking for ways to get with his crush. (Side note: to my understanding, B do think that he and his gf will break up if his crush is no longer around. I might be wrong, tho. It'll be helpful if a Korean speaker can chime in)\n\nI think, it comes down to what you value. I value my close relationships and hate it if something was to come between us, especially if it's something that is unexpected (I'm not aware of it and don't have control over it). Or if the relationships are not genuine.\n\nWhile others, value honesty. Not just with other people, but also with yourself. With A, what you see is what you get. He's a cheater and he knows it. While with B, there's possibility that he will justify his actions. Worse, if he is pining over his crush and will get with her if the situation allow for it. I mean, the fact that people in the show are calling it 'romantic' is telling. It's the same reasoning that B probably has without taking into account how terrible it must have been for his gf. It's the self awareness aspect, most probably.\n\nHonestly, I'm not really sure I can choose A or B. I hate both of these situations. It just bothers me when the situation in B is frame as romantic and totally overlook the friendship between the girls.",

Attraction is one thing and liking a person enough to want to spend the time, effort, and resources to date said person is another. Also, despite the summary not stating whether the guy in B has zero feelings for the girl he's actually dating, just based on the fact that he approached the relationship wanting to stay close to his crush very likely points to him not having any feelings for the friend. If he cared for her, he wouldn't jeopardize the girl's friendship, waste the girl's time and affections, and create a situation where he would have to make a terrible decision if somehow the crush does decide to reciprocate the feelings. He prioritized his own feelings to the detriment of both the girls and regardless of how the girls end up feeling about him, would ruin their friendship if the truth came out.\n\nAlso, A is being brutally honest to the cheating female partner, not the gf. The whole point I was making was that she was also in the wrong precisely because she is made aware of the fact he's cheating on his gf with her. If she didn't know this fact, then she's also a victim. The two girls in situation B don't have this luxury. It's not a simple white lie, the guy in B knowingly moved forward with the relationship without letting the girl he's dating know (it was implied she didn't know) and only to use her to get to her friend. That breaks so many levels of decency and shows how little he respects both girls if he thought that was a good idea.",

There's nothing romantic with deceiving two people who are best friends, just because you can't be honest with your own feelings. I just find it puzzling how B is more willing to pretend that he is in 'love' to another rather than admitting his crush. To me, it seems like B is taking advantage of his current gf\n\nStill, both of the situations are terrible. As seen by how angry the casts had got.",

The latter is dating a girl he has no interest in, lowkey stalking his crush by using his girlfriend, and is also okay with the friendship between the girls potentially getting sabotaged for his own purpose.

In dating, men generally care about a woman's past, while women generally care about a man's future.\n\n&gt; the B scenario AT ALL being romantic because it's the guy tricking and using a woman's feelings to justify his cowardice for not being able to confess to the girl he actually likes (likely because she would reject him, cuz otherwise he would just go for it). A is also bad but at least it's the cheating guy being brutally honest to the girl he's cheating with. whether she wants to accept such a controlling cheating ass is on her to decide because she at the very least knows the situation.\n\nFrom a man's perspective on why B is romantic, it's because he's sacrificing his own feelings. It's trashy don't get me wrong, but what the crush doesn't know won't harm her because the man hasn't expressed anything towards her. Meanwhile in A, the woman knows that she's about to have sex with a cheater. It won't only harm her but also the \"legal\" partner, because an incident like that will only escalate until the legal wife/girlfriend finds out and it all goes to hell. That's why to me, A is worse, because more people are harmed in the end.\n\n&gt; cowardice for not being able to confess to the girl he actually likes\n\nLet's drop the guy in B dating the best friend for a second. This is interesting because this happens more than women think. You know why memes like \"Press F for our fallen brother\" or \"friendzone\" exist? I'm in my 30s and I never realized that women called this behavior cowardly, mainly because it happens a lot. It's why male partners generally won't agree to their women hanging out with their male friends. I'm sure that at least one woman in this thread has had a male friend that they can lean on whenever their relationship with their BF/husband sours...that's the kind of guy you're calling cowardly, lol. That's why there's this big debate about \"Can men and women just be friends\" because men know that other men are after the same thing they are, which is you, the women. Now do you get the romantic aspect? The whole dating the best friend aside, men hang out with their crushes not expecting anything in return but helping them whenever they need it. Harry Potter spoiler alert, &gt;!it's Severus Snape's storyline in HBP.!&lt; \"Why don't they just confess?\" That's why. He doesn't want to risk what they already have (a close relationship), because the man knows that if he tries taking it further, he'll lose what he wants the most.",

For the man, sacrificing his own feelings is because he knows his crush isn't interested in him, therefore he won't confess since it's not worth the risk of worsening the relationship they already have. For the crush, it's more like she will be affected by the admission, since in this situation you have a friendly relationship, and she might get pressured into answering even though she's not attracted to you at all. \n\nImo I find it interesting that men and women approach this subject very differently; I think it's because in the dating space, it's harder to be a man than it is to be a woman. Women in general don't have problems being approached by men, that's probably why they think not confessing is \"cowardly\". Meanwhile men (that aren't the top 1% of all men) don't get approached often; there's a statistic in Tinder that says women get matches on average more than men do (women on average would have to like just three men while a man would need to like over 50 women). Men \"strike out\" more than women do, which is why the view of people acting like Snape are viewed as romantic, or a failed romantic at the very least, because he holds that love for his crush despite the crush never noticing.\n\n&gt; I find most of the romance in movies to be nonsensical\n\nMe as well. I'm just using it as a basis for the argument. I agree that personal experience vs movies are different too.",

However, it's important to note, while we can all agree both men in A and B are trashy, it's the justification for the guy in B that his \"sacrifice\" means anything to anybody is what's wrong here. The guy in B is hoping the truth stays buried but somehow still hopes to end up with the crush? What is the endgame here? There's a lot of missing steps in this train of thought, most of which will end up with either the gf finding out, the crush finding out, or more likely, both of them finding out. \n\nIf you like a women and think you should confess, then confess, if not, then that's your decision and that shouldn't be an indication that anybody owes you. The burden of your feelings ultimately lies on you, and if you're lucky enough, people who love you and want to support you, but not anybody else. While I get being friend-zoned feels super bad for everybody involved, resorting to lying and hurting other people to defend your fear of rejection and use that as justification for your selfish actions is just bad. It was bad for the guy in B and it's just as bad for Snape in HP (the whole point of his \"redemption\" is that he kind of sees past his hatred of James for \"stealing\" Lily away and stops venting his anger on a poor traumatized child).\n\nAs for the classic debate about whether it is possible for men and women to be friends, it really depends on who you are as a person. If you can look beyond whether a person identifies as man/woman/nonbinary and understand that your attraction to said person is only one small part of what constitutes a relationship, then yes, you can be friends. If you can't, then that's also valid but don't expect your own experiences have more weight than others because you want it to be. Lastly, to put an end to this long reply, there's really no need to always make it a competition b/w men with the prized object being the women's affections, because that feels kind of reductive and the antithesis to my discussion about respecting women enough to not have to lie and use them as tools to date them.",

Sacrificing for your loved ones is a romantic element in a lot of stories.\n\n&gt; What is the endgame here? There's a lot of missing steps in this train of thought, most of which will end up with either the gf finding out, the crush finding out, or more likely, both of them finding out. \n\nThe endgame being two things: what you said, or the guy in B falling for the best friend instead.\n\n&gt; It was bad for the guy in B and it's just as bad for Snape in HP (the whole point of his \"redemption\" is that he kind of sees past his hatred of James for \"stealing\" Lily away and stops venting his anger on a poor traumatized child).\n\nNope. You didn't understand Snape's character arc if that were the case; the reason why Snape was harsh on Harry was definitely because of his anger towards James as his bully, but he never hated Harry because he was Lily's son. Snape never vented on Harry. Being harsh was all an act, and what ultimately sold him as an enemy to the OotP (when he was on Dumbledore's side all along).\n\n&gt; If you like a women and think you should confess, then confess, if not, then that's your decision and that shouldn't be an indication that anybody owes you.\n\nNobody here is saying the woman owes the man anything. The point is that people see the act of not confessing as a loving sacrifice, a romantic sacrifice. Ofc what B is doing is bad, but if you remove the fact that he's dating his crush's best friend, it ceases to be bad. I think the crux of the argument here is that you think not confessing is cowardly; this is a harsh truth but women don't realize how most men hanging around you want you, but aren't saying anything because they're scared that your relationship with them will end. Most men aren't also born genetically gifted, rich, or any combination of the 2. That's why when women say things like \"You're gonna make a good boyfriend\" or \"I'm sure someone out there is fit for you\" to the man, the man is probably laughing or crying inside, since if those platitudes were true then you'd already be interested in him. Why do you think there was a Tiktok trend about \"Kissing my Best Friend and Seeing How He Reacts\" w/ most of those Tiktoks being successful (in that the male best friend kissed back)?\n\n&gt;  If you can't, then that's also valid but don't expect your own experiences have more weight than others because you want it to be.\n\nI apologize if I came across that way, however you should trust men more on how men act, rather than taking the advice of women on how men act. As a man, \"it's possible for men and women to be friends\" was also something I believed in until a girl who I just had a friendly relationship told me \"Hey I'm horny rn, wanna fuck?\"\n\nIn fact, to prove it to you, call any of your male friends rn and tell them the same sentence that girl told me. I guarantee you they'll be down 90% of the time, regardless of their relationship status.\n\n&gt;  Lastly, to put an end to this long reply, there's really no need to always make it a competition b/w men with the prized object being the women's affections, because that feels kind of reductive and the antithesis to my discussion about respecting women enough to not have to lie and use them as tools to date them.\n\nI disagree mainly because affections of ANY person are usually a competition given they're surrounded by enough people, otherwise love triangles wouldn't be a thing. Imo as long as the prized object are a person's affections, competition will happen. As for women's affections being a prized object being reductive about respecting women, men's affections are also prized objects for women. The top percentage of men's, that is.",

When the incident that changed your mind about the possibility of platonic friendship is a *woman* showing interest in a *man*.\n\nTo put it another way, it's interesting how you explained the thought process of men regarding women. And how (for you) because of these thought process that men have, they're unable to be friends with women. But, one of the thing which led you to this conclusion is an action done by your woman friend. I don't know, based on what you're saying, shouldn't you asked your women friends when she told you that? Since in your opinion, 'you should trust men on how men act' and, I assume it is also true, vice-versa?\n\nI don't really have strong opinions on some of the points that you brought up. I just think it's possible that certain things aren't gender specific (i.e. man is like this, woman is like that).",

I realize that it's my fault for not explaining the entire thing.\n\nI wasn't a social butterfly so I was a bit behind on social cues. When that incident happened and told my male buddies, I got made fun of because I didn't take her up on her offer, and apparently they wanted that to happen to them. Now being in my 30s, I've had my fair share of female acquaintances over the years and I've definitely been attracted to most of them; needless to say, none of them offered fun time. That certain female friend made me aware of social cues (and my own desires), about how the dating space works, about how men think differently from women and vice versa, etc. I could call any random woman right now and I guarantee you none of them will be dtf lol. I thank my female friend at the time for making me aware of it.\n\nI definitely agree that certain things aren't gender specific, but in this case it is.

I much prefer chaos. Which is why I loved Sixth Sense. \ud83d\ude01 \n\nBack to RM, Sukjin, SoMin and Haha carried this episode. They had me laughing the most. Haha and SoMin are Honestly another one of those pairs that just work. Him getting her to reach the conclusion that she was annoying Haha and YSC by not listening to them and taking their hints was the highlight of the episode. The staff laughing behind the camera was just the cherry on top. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nSukjin and his thrustsquats and his comments in the discussion part were brilliant as well. \n\nI also have to mention SoMin's interesting squatting technique. \ud83d\ude01 Gravity seems to pull her harder than others. I find it funny how the younger ones were having more trouble with the squats \ud83d\ude02. Cause same. \n\nAll in all, a funny episode. Not great, not unique, but definitely funny. I would have loved to seen more of the camping fiasco of the maknaes with Haha. Also, no hate to the guests or members, I really wanted to skip the parts with the two teams upstairs when it was the guest teams just having concerts and begging for food. Ended up taking a bathroom break then. (Thankfully didn't miss the campers) this is because they weren't given things to do, unlike the camping. It just ended up being the same old dynamics, cast carrying the segment. \n\nAlso a quick note about something I noticed; I know this is so nitpicky; but hear me out. When SeChan was about to run after his squats, YJS pulled on his sling bag as a way to cheat or stop him. YSC ran full force, either unbuckling it or just yanking it away, which means it ended up being nothing. It just looked weird. I've said it before about him playing to win, and that was an instance of this. Let's say it was KwangSoo or Sukjin that happened to. Both would have gone with the joke, KwangSoo exaggerating and falling and Sukjin running and then stopping and looking back to see what happened. YJS does these things not to mess up the game, but create those exact reactions and moments. A person with variety sense would pick up on those and immediately run with it. This is why I am sometimes critical of YSC. Him not acknowledging that just made it seem rude (on both of their sides), and also wasted what could have been a funny scene. \n\nAnd lastly, just like I mentioned before on here; unless you're a huge star, a variety genius or close with the cast - you're not gonna get much attention on RM. It is what it is. I liked the guest well enough, but they didn't contribute much.",

    "postText": "&gt; OSEN exclusively reported on Feb 23rd that broadcaster Yoo Jae Suk will be in charge of hosting and singer Lee Juck will be in charge of singing at Lee Seung Gi and Lee Da In\u2018s wedding in April.\n\n\nKnetz reaction:\n\n1. [+87] Isn't she from a family that committed stock manipulation, causing people to lose their life's savings and commit suicide????? He's becoming the son-in-law to such a family?\n\n\n\n2. [+59] Where's Ho Dong ajusshi..?? \ud83d\ude22\n\n3. [+32] Shouldn't Kang Ho Dong be the one hosting??\n\n4. [+54] It's his wedding so I know my opinion doesn't matter but it's funny to me that he's choosing to have such a loud and flashy wedding when he knows how controversial this whole thing has become. Yoo Jae Suk and Lee Juck obviously can't turn down these requests since they're personal friends but Lee Seung Gi should know that this hurts their image... He would be getting a lot less hate right now if he just chose to have a quiet and private ceremony instead..\n\n5. [+18] Oh yeah, I'm sure he desperately needs Yoo Jae Suk right now\n\n6. [+19] So disappointed in Lee Seung Gi as a former fan\n\n7. [+43] Wasn't Lee Seung Gi always under the Kang Ho Dong line?\n\n8. [+3] Seung Gi oppa, you haven't gone down the aisle yet so free yourself from their gaslighting...\n\n9. [+1] Maybe this is Lee Seung Gi's big picture plan to save Kang Ho Dong's image from going down the sh*tter with his and choosing Yoo Jae Suk to host instead\n\n10. [+26] As someone who's watched Lee Seung Gi since his '1N2D' days, I can't help but think Kang Ho Dong must be a little disappointed he wasn't asked to host. He's the first person who opened the doors to the variety world for him. \n\n11. [+37, -4] Please keep your wedding quiet... don't put this stuff in the news, it's only going to get your host and singer more hate...\n\n12. [+13, -0] Kang Ho Dong must feel sad... Does Lee Seung Gi even have any personal ties to Yoo Jae Suk?? Perhaps Kyeon Miri begged Yoo Jae Suk to host it \u314b\u314b\u314b\n\n13. [+12, -1] I've never seen a star with such a positive image crumble so fast... all because of Kyeon Miri's daughter\n\n14. [+9, -1] Stop acting like your wedding is the wedding of the century and keep it quiet\n\n15. [+8, -2] All this fanfare when they'd be best to keep it all quiet\n\n16. [+8, -2] Just hearing his name is tiring now, please just live your life quietly\n\n17. [+6, -1] Lee Seung Gi spent so long on '1N2D' with Kang Ho Dong... he has no ties to Yoo Jae Suk, no recent shows together so it feels weird that he was asked to host??\n\n18. [+5, -0] I just don't care anymore \u315c Lee Seung Gi has lost all charm!! His popularity was just a bubble!\n\n\n\nSource: [nb](http://netizenbuzz.blogspot.com/2023/02/yoo-jae-suk-to-mc-for-lee-seung-gi-and.html)",

Like most people, I thought he was closer to KHD at least on variety shows but yeah, who knows what the real life situation is. I probably won't be as surprised if it was anyone else (not YJS) hosting.",

International fans might not feel the same way but for the locals it\u2019s pretty huge since there were victims who committed suicide \ud83e\udee0\n\nWhether or not she\u2019s enjoying her family\u2019s dirty gains she\u2019s even more hated now and all these publicity will destroy her career entirely if it\u2019s not already in shambles since her family\u2019s history is getting brought up again and again.",

May not be the wisest of things to do (trust no industry men lol) but he's shown over decades that he has a heart of gold, and I trust him to do the right thing. \n\nLSG is a bit correct about facing things publicly though. He's still booked and busy going on multiple variety shows, so I don't think his career is taking too much of a hit. I think that as long as he doesn't mention it publicly (sorry dude, no lovey dovey variety moments) it should be fine. Like I forget half the time that Jiwon had a divorce with Lee Dongkook's sister, so it should be the same for LSG.",

Had she been the daughter of a chaebol or even just a regular family, no one would have cared.  It's because he's had such a squeaky clean image, been scammed by his former agency, and is marrying into a family with alleged scammer ties that people are kicking up a fuss, probably because they've watched him \"grow up\" on TV since 1N2D and think he's making a mistake.\n\nPersonally,  I feel bad for him.  I'm not sure what's the right move is, tbh because canceling would set a really bad precedent, but in continuing on, the couple is basically tarnishing everyone else by association.  Unless they're hoping to use their friends' reputations as a temporary shield or something but yikes.  I think it'll probably die down once the wedding is over (though it'll probably continue to be a shit show when the engagement photos and whatnot pre-wedding stuff are posted) and then pick up again once the couple announces that she's pregnant x.x It'll pretty much follow them forever knowing knetz.",

Especially since netizens keep focusing on Lee Dain's family's finances. I can see why KHD wouldn't be the best person to host the wedding. YJS loves hosting weddings for his dongsaengs, he could've volunteered. Remember YJS and KHD are friends and regularly go to the sauna together and have dinners. I'm sure they've all talked amongst themselves and there's no problems. \n\nI feel like instead of the mom talking to the news and trying to clear things up, the step dad should step up and apologize and take the blame for all his wrong doings and talk about how good of a daughter Lee Dain is. That probably would've been more effective. But then again netizens will probably just hate on anything he says. But the daughter has nothing to do with her stepdad's crimes while she may have benefitted from it financially when she was young, her mom also made her own money and the two daughters are both active in the industry and make their own money now as adults. It wasn't their fault their mom married a crook and it also wasn't their fault their stepdad did shady things to gain money. At the end of the day he went to prison and did his time. What else do people want them to do...?",

Do they expect the daughters to cut ties with him just because he went to prison? He did his time. Him being a crook is his own fault. People are dragging the daughters as if they had control over what their stepdad did. If you told your dad to stop manipulating people through stocks, do you think he would listen to you and stop what he was doing? Be realistic. We don't even know if the daughters knew what the stepdad was doing. Like I said, he could be both a good father and a criminal and the daughters were clearly happy with him as a father. How he made his money and how the daughters may have benefitted from is not the daughters' fault. The fault is their stepdad's in which he already did his time. Would people be happy to see the family be broken apart? If Lee Seung-gi broke up the marriage due to the stepdad's fault, how would he look? Would people be happy, knowing they broke someone's marriage...? Seriously what do people want them to do?? I stand by what I said and that is there is no reason the daughters should keep getting dragged for their stepfather's wrong doings. They're not the ones who committed the crimes.",

Which is why this announcement can come as a surprise. \n\nBut either way, its his wedding, his relationships and his choice who he asks to MC.",

In any case, it is no one\u2019s business, but the couple themselves. \n\nThe internet gossips just like to complain. \n\nThis idea that LSG should be concerned about his public image is a load of crap. Where has being the good son of Koreans got him? Answer: mistreated by his company for most of his career. \n\nI think Seunggi will care about his happiness and the happiness of his wife. If he enters into marriage acting as if he is ashamed of his wife, then his marriage is off to a bad start. When he decided to marry her, he decided to publicly commit to being her husband. A wedding is a public declaration of that new commitment. Hiding with a less public affair would be a sign of a lack of sincerity on his part. \n\nThe supposed fans who are pretending to care about LSG\u2019s public image should care about his private happiness instead.",

As the backlash they get for this is pretty insane but If we move up to the drama sphere his wife n her sister is still get casted here n there. Their mother is still a respectable actress  n their go to actress to play chaebol lady. Maybe if the hate getting more intense we will sadly missing seunggi in the variety sphere n will only focus on his drama",

I mean after getting betrayed by his ex-agency, I hope there's no stories comes from his wife or in-law bring him to shitty path. \n\nWe heard about celebrity who suddenly have a big shit happen because the greed and manipulation from his own blood main family. There's also celebrity who turn worse in attitude after married. If shit can happen from our own main family who shared same blood running on our vein, it's also easier for not related blood family like in-law, wife/husband, boyfriend/girlfriend, close friend, just friend, and stranger. Because the news circulated, I just hope the in-law doesn't do fuckin shit and already change. Human can change to be better or worse, but still can remain the same for their life.",

That relationship that everyone is claiming to be so hurt over was destroyed by Hodong in 2012.  It has been a decade.  People move on.  It is only natural. \n\nAs for his choice of wife, that's his choice. Only time will tell how good or bad of a decision it was.

It's not even that *she* is or did anything bad but people are making all these assumptions about her and stuff. It kind of feels like they are just bringing up her family as an excuse to trash her around because they don't want him to be with her since she isn't as popular or well known, not that they actually \"care\" about him. I don't see anyone saying anything about Lee Yoo Bi and they are sisters aren't they? It's kind of ridiculous isn't it?\n\nHaven't the dramas and movies we've been watching all this time taught us anything? lol\n\nAnd on the matter of the host, does it really matter?

Samsung doesn\u2019t inflate their stock prizes leading to suicides. Definitely anyone would be proud of working for a company that is face of their country. As with govt, they are corrupt ppl everywhere and everyone gets called out when they lead to scandal. I read that scandal of the her step father was one of the  biggest scandal by individual during that time..for a country like SK, 300K ppl impacted is definitely huge number.\n\nBut at end of the day, as international audience, we need to leave few things who went through it and stop tying everything to cancel culture. It\u2019s easy to pass judgment  , oh it\u2019s their step-father , they had jail time etc..but pain of losing hard earned money  is very difficult to deal with.

I wouldn't be surprised if all these negative news about Lee Seung-gi is their doing to tarnish his image after he pulled through and continued with the lawsuit and donated the hush money they tried to bribe him with. Maybe he knows they're the ones getting these articles written up and that's why he isn't budging no matter what people say. I know people don't like Lee Dain's stepfather and she may have benefitted from her stepdad's past but he literally raised her as his own daughter and she sees him as her father more than her real dad. The stepdad could be both a good dad and a criminal. His wrong doings are his own. How is a child supposed to stop their father from doing shady things when she was young when it happened? Those were out of her control. For people to continue to demonize her when she isn't the one at fault is beyond me. Also, hating on Lee Seung-gi just because he is marrying her...He's marrying Lee Dain not her step father. Plus, the stepdad already paid his dues by going to prison for his shady business so he did his time. Lee Seung-gi makes his own money. Lee Dain also makes her own money. When they get married and create their family, they will be using their own money. People need to leave them alone. Also, they can have a fancy wedding if they want to. It's their wedding not anybody else's. However they want their wedding to be is their call. Why are people trying to dictate how they should celebrate their special day...?",

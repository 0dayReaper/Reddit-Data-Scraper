    "postText": "**Heart Signal 4 (\ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub1104)** is finally here after 3 years.\n\n---\n\nSynopsis:\n\n&gt; Cupid returns for a fresh assault on the hearts of a new group of romance-ready singletons. The group has never met before, but must live together in Signal House. The house rules encourage flirty behavior, but forbid housemates from directly telling anyone that they like them. Instead, they must express their feelings via text message. But there\u2019s a twist: All texts to housemates are anonymous \u2013 meaning recipients have to guess who is trying to make a love connection with them.\n\n&gt; Watching events unfurl in the house is a celebrity panel of love experts. These include returning romance fans Yoon Jong Shin, Kim Ea Na, and Lee Sang Min, all veterans of previous \u201cHeart Signal\u201d seasons. And joining this trio this time around is a fresh crop of star pundits, including OH MY GIRL member Mimi, Kang Seung Yoon of WINNER, and leading psychiatrist Kim Chong Gi.\n\n&gt; This variety TV show series is the follow-up to 2017\u2019s \u201cHeart Signal.\u201d A second series was released in 2018. And this was followed up with Season 3 in 2020.\n\n&gt; \u201cHeart Signal 4\u201d is a 2023 South Korean reality TV/variety show that was produced by Park Cheol Hwan.\n\n---\n\n#Cast\n\nLee Jumi (\uc774 \uc8fc\ubbf8)\n\nKim Jiyoung (\uae40 \uc9c0\uc601)\n\nKim Jimin (\uae40 \uc9c0\ubbfc)\n\n\\-\n\nShin Mingyu (\uc2e0 \ubbfc\uaddc)\n\nHan Gyeore (\ud55c \uaca8\ub808)\n\nYoo Jiwon (\uc720 \uc9c0\uc6d0)\n\n---\n\n#Panelists\n\nKim Eana\n\nLee Sangmin\n\nYoon Jongshin\n\nKang Seungyoon (from WINNER group)\n\nKim Mihyun or Mimi/\ubbf8\ubbf8 (from OMG group)\n\nKim Chonggi (psychiatrist)\n\n---\n\n#Subtitles\n\nSubtitles | | \n---------|----------|\nStream | [Viki](https://www.viki.com/tv/39844c-heart-signal-4)\nStream | [KOCOWA](https://www.kocowa.com/en_us/season/77851672/heart-signal-4)\n\n---\n\n**Heart Signal Youtube channel or \ud558\ud2b8\uc2dc\uadf8\ub110 \ub77c\ube44\ud2f0\ube44 channel**: https://www.youtube.com/@channelA-heartsignal/videos\n\nHeart Signal 4 teasers and clips playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFIYUdSkjiCAuWe006VqSTFfaE7rgIHNy\n\nHeart Signal 4 production stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46UmvFNwi9Q\n\n---\n\n**Heart Signal 4 commentary with Heart Signal 2 Jaeho and some other people**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRuQmQUKLvQ\n\nGaheun (Heart Signal 3 and Friends) and Jaeho with the Heart Signal 4 house: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86F9hZ-7nxc\n\nJangmi (Heart Signal 2 and Friends) and Jaeho with the Heart Signal 4 house: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAcupLirqOk\n\nHeart Signal 4 Official BGM Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8djlZk6ZeM0\n\n---\n\n**The Chinese version of Heart Signal (\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7) has an engaged couple now**, don't click this link unless you finished Heart Signal 2 (\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b63), oh and it also talks about Terrace House marriages too: https://www.reddit.com/r/heartsignal/comments/13p3qqr/heart_signal_2_\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7,_Chinese/\uc911\uad6d_version_couple/\n\nFor Heart Signal, the original Korean version and some seasons of the Chinese version should be on Viki. \n\nSeason 2 of both the Korean and Chinese versions are considered the best, and now some people also really like the 5th season of the Chinese version. The upcoming 6th season of the Chinese version is being prepared at the moment, it might be out later this 2023 year or so.\n\nHeart Signal 1 (Korean Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/35675c-heart-signal\n\nHeart Signal 2 (Korean Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/36949c-heart-signal-2\n\nHeart Signal 3 (Korean Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/36950c-heart-signal-3\n\n\\-\n\nHeart Signal 1 (Chinese Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/36228c-heart-signal-chinese-version\n\nHeart Signal 2 (Chinese Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/36654c-heart-signal-2-chinese-version\n\nHeart Signal 5 (Chinese Version): https://www.viki.com/tv/38812c-heart-signal-5-chinese-version\n\nWith the Chinese version of Heart Signal, it's available on the WeTV/Tencent Video website (has English subs), and also their WeTV/Tencent Video channels on Youtube for free but without proper English subs.\n\nThrough the Tencent Video Youtube channel you'll have to use auto-translate from Chinese/Mandarin or maybe say Thai, Vietnamese, etc. So for English subs you have to check their own WeTV/Tencent Video/etc. website.\n\nViki has the 1st, 2nd, and 5th seasons of the Chinese version of Heart Signal, so you'll have to look for the 3rd (\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7S3) and 4th season (\u5fc3\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7S4) elsewhere. Like use auto-translate/etc. with the Youtube episodes, or check their actual WeTV/Tencent Video website.\n\nHeart Signal 3 (Chinese Version), Episode 1 and playlist (has Thai and Vietnamese subtitles, use auto-translate to English/any desired language): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywBixGNlkYs&amp;list=PLMX26aiIvX5reBhNMq0rNZHoDa_aGblAs\n\nHeart Signal 4 (Chinese Version), Episode 1 and playlist (these episodes on Youtube for the 4th season don't even have automatic captions/subtitles (no Thai/Vietnamese/Chinese/etc. subs either), so go on WeTV/Tencent Video's website or some places (like Bilibili, etc.) for other subtitles): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWNF5cxAap0&amp;list=PLb8w8KsDSK1wtxaCeyEAMXCHxsCYJLK4A\n\n---\n\nExpect English subtitles on Viki/etc. to appear after 6/12/etc. hours from Korean release.",

            "comment": "After 2 eps, we're getting a pretty clear picture of the cast members. I also wrote this while watching so I flip flopped a bit and had to edit a few points.\n\nMy fav is easily Jumi as she is the independent, active type who is funnily enough the most timid in the love department. Her job as lawyer and hobby as a drummer makes me like her even more so I'm really rooting for her with either Jiwon or the catfish because Gyeore is too far gone now. Jimin is the coy, teasing type, and her being the youngest and a uni student was as expected. I find it funny she seems to want to bide her time but also makes the most obvious moves to get Jiwon's attention. I can see why Jiwon would get tired of it (especially given his job). Jiyoung is a good balance b/w Jumi and Jimin, a good conversationalist, knows how to show off her charms, but also clearly defines her boundaries and seems a cute, earnest gal.\n\nOn the men's side, Mingyu is the type to always observe on the outside first, is very intelligent and tries to let his actions (albeit small) speak for him, which sadly doesn't work on Jimin. He really should try talkng to Jumi and Jiyoung more cuz they both would at least treat him well even if the feelings weren't there. Jiwon being the youngest bar Jimin and a medical intern was a surprise (thought he was a sports medicine physician or something) but he still feels as mature as Mingyu and has the most sense of the 3. Lastly, the oldest Gyeore is surprisingly the purest and most quiet of the bunch. His straightforwardness needs to be toned down though or I can see all the girls choosing somebody else in the end. Hearts on the sleeve that one; it's going to be so hard to watch him when Jiyoung inevitably has to interact with the other guys in a 1v1 date and come home looking happy or having fun.\n\nFavorite date is Jumi and Jiwon's as they felt the most organic. I can defo feel the tension and uncertainty from her despite sharing so many hobbies and both being so down-to-earth and in tough professions. I was really surprised when Jumi chose Gyeore despite it all since I would've thought Jiwon at least made enough of a dent for her to choose him this once. Jiyoung and Gyeore's date was a bit of a disaster despite them choosing each other in the end, which I was also surprised about as I still don't really feel like Jiyoung likes Gyeore. That preview does seem to indicate some drama b/w Jumi and Jimin but not sure how much of that is real and what the context is so I'm hoping nobody gets too much hate regardless. Also, finally male catfish is here and it's always a dark and rough looking guy lol.\n\nAs an aside, my favorite thing about the panelists so far is Sangmin being so adamant about certain stuff and the others acting surprised and disagreeing, and him being flabbergasted at them for disagreeing; it happened almost every time we cut back to the panelists ready for discourse. I also find myself agreeing with all of Kim Eana's points which is cool since she's my fav panelist for dating shows.",

The commentary by the past cast of Heart Signal mentioned that her image doesn\u2019t match her professional job lol\n\n&gt;!Her playing drums as a hobby and picking up other hobbies because of her professional job\u2026 The musical instrument that she learned to play makes sense. If she wants to rest her fingers, guitar or keyboard is not it, and drums are better.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Seems like knetz are shipping Jumi and Jiwon now lol which may not happen at all since she doesn\u2019t go for someone younger than her. It\u2019s a shame though because I kinda like them tgt too.!&lt;\n\nAnd finally figured out who wear their ring on their index and middle finger because I was figuring that out from the previews before the premiere.&gt;! Jiyoung wears more like a gold one on her index finger while Jumi wears a silver one on her middle finger.!&lt;\n\n\\*edited to add that the panel should talk less or their screentime be less than they have so far.",

I also hate that we can hear their commentaries when we're watching the housemates on screen. The panel talking over the housemates is quite distracting.\n\nI also feel like the panel is pushing narratives and feeding it to the viewers. I noticed that the discussions in several platforms are highly influenced by the narratives pushed by the panel. I feel like it's better that the panel is just there to observe,  share what they can infer from it and be like the representatives of the the audience.",

I was hoping she didn\u2019t because I feel like it\u2019s really obvious, but Jiyoung\u2019s guesses just threw me off. Playing gayageum with thimble just doesn\u2019t makes any sense at all. Can\u2019t believe she\u2019s 29. \n\nFor now, I\u2019m liking Jumi, Jiwon and Mingyu because they just feel more natural on camera. I\u2019m glad most of them are late 20s to early 30s with career unrelated to show business. It\u2019s tiring to watch dating shows when it\u2019s too obvious they are only trying to get into or solidify their influencer status. \n\nPreview for EP 3 seems promising I can\u2019t wait for next week. \ud83e\udd29",

They just seem to have easy-going personalities and seem less aware of the cameras. &gt;!I can't believe Mingyu didn't get a vote. He seemed nice and interacted fairly well with everybody. I guess his kindness didn't equate to charm lmao. Kinda sad too that no one seemed to know the nature of his job so he didn't get such a huge reaction from the girls. If I were him I would have hinted that I graduated from an international school, entered Korea University, or had a stint with LG just to get some bonus points lol!&lt; But then, I also liked that he didn't go into such details.

His job actually suit him which how much aware he is. He's too humble and not many people really get what his job scope are, i get it. I just love people who are emotionally aware and present.",

I honestly think she didn\u2019t vote for him because of his age. I\u2019m curious to see if they will get to know each other more or if things kinda just end from here. \n\nGyorae seems head over heels for Jiyoung already, but the feelings don\u2019t look as mutual (she likes him but not as much as he clearly likes her). I think Jiyoung is def gonna explore her options and good on her for doing so!\n\nJimin seems the same as Gyorae, head over heels for Jiwon. He doesn\u2019t seem to flirt back or pay her any special attention, but she did say she likes a challenge so idk what will happen. I hope Mingyu doesn\u2019t just pine after her during the entire show and makes some moves of his own!\n\nThe catfish seems to shake things up, but I wonder if it\u2019s just the excitement of a shiny new thing or if he genuinely can capture the girls\u2019 interest? \n\nSide note: I hate how the hosts pit the women against each other and make them seem so manipulative.

He listens well and the way he reacts to/cares for  Jimin is adorable. (When Jimin showed her sketchbook, he is trying hard not to smile too much but fails miserably!)\n\nJiyoung's date with Gyeore is a bit lukewarm for me but I like how she presented her ideal type. Gyeore's response is bland but Kim Eana's remarks make sense.\n\nI am not shipping anyone from the cast yet but the breakfast with the boys are nice too. A viki user commented the chemistry in those moments, and I agree. Mingyu catching Gyeore's smile is actually cute too.

            "comment": "I really like Jumi, she\u2019s all around seems like a great person. It\u2019s so weird that I ship her with every guy, like she seems to just mesh well with every guy so I\u2019m honestly happy with any guy Ashe gets with. Her date with Jiwon was so cute so I\u2019m really rooting for them and the whole doctor lawyer type aspect or her with Mingyu.\n\nTruthfully I like all the girls. But I know I\u2019m going to dislike Jimin slowly bc I believe that she\u2019s just going to string mingyu along. I don\u2019t think she really likes him at all and I lowkey think she thinks that he\u2019s easy so he\u2019s going to be her safety net if she can\u2019t get jiwon. But I like her for now.\n\nJiyoung is kinda boring I don\u2019t like her a lot but I also don\u2019t dislike her. I think she wants someone to like her for her personality what\u2019s within her rather than her looks so I respect it a lot. But she doesn\u2019t seem to really add anything except that she\u2019s pretty. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nI love how observant mingyu is. Jiwon seems cool and I can\u2019t really get a read on gyeore. \n\nI also really hate the commentary. They are lowkey biased and it\u2019s sooooooo annoying. The either over-analyze every little detail or just ignore really big signs like it\u2019s so obvious that Jiwon is into jumi. They care so much about appearance but act like they don\u2019t. I would also rather we get no preview than to be mislead. Like what is the point in showing us anything if it doesn\u2019t even happen. I hate it.",

The dogs helped tho.\n\nThe panel keeps saying the cast is moving fast but i'm used to shows that move so much faster! \n\nOk the cooking scene gave us some tension finally. Thank u jimin. And gurl went to india by herself for 2 yrs when she was like 10? That's pretty impressive.\n\nWooooooow i had no clue GR was so \"old.\" He's got a babyface.\n\nThis gurl is nearly THIRTY(!?) and doesnt know how to safely chop an onion??? \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f seriously shocking \n\nMG def got hotter now that I know his job.

Also, imagine being a medical intern at a hospital and also going on a dating show for a month \ud83d\ude02 talk abt high achiever \n\nYoooooooooo male catfish next week \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 i hope he brings the drama.",

Why have them enter these shows? The age gap is glaring and she has a lower level playing field compared to actual working adults.\n\nI mean in the real world this can happen but it just seems like wasted potential and space when there's no one else close to her level of experience. I don't really mind age gaps but one's stage in life does matter when it comes to relationships and this just seems like a huge hurdle to hand over a person.",

I'm absolutely surprised because I was expecting Ji Young to be the most popular girl to the viewers. I wonder what the Korean viewers think. I have not been checking their forums yet.\n\nSo far, Jumi is my fave too. She's caring and reliable. She's an interesting person but it seems that it takes time for her to feel comfortable to open up. That'sgoing to be a disadvantage for her given that they only have limited time. As for guys, Min Gyu is probably the one I'm most attracted to. Smart, calm and observant.\n\nI wish the panel had lesser airtime. Inserting their discussion every  5min ruins the momentum for me. I still can't stand Mimi. I'm sorry. I wish they bring back the model who was a psychology major in season 1 as a panelist.\n\nIm having a hard time guessing their votes. Jumi and Jiwon were not awkward and were very comfortable. So, I don't understand her vote. I hope she gives him a chance. Idk, but I can see Min Kyu changing direction towards Jumi as well. Jimin looks fixed on Jiwon but might keep Min Gyu as safety net. JY and GR are almost set unless the catfish comes in between them.",

It's such a great feature, definitely helps with /r/languagelearning too.\n\nIf only all Chinese/Japanese/Korean/etc. streaming services and channels enabled automated captions/subtitles. Like as you can see with the WeTV/Tencent Video channel, they don't allow it anymore on the later seasons of Heart Signal (Chinese Version). Like it will say \"Subtitles/closed captions unavailable\" if you click on the CC icon/button.\n\n---\n\nIf you want to do some /r/languagelearning with Korean, Japanese, Chinese, check here for the recommended apps and resources: https://www.reddit.com/r/Physical100/comments/10kzl0i/i_hope_people_start_to_remember_the_contestants/j5tp3o6/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/104w0ib/why_chinese_names_in_kpop_are_like_that_or/j38bf3v/\n\nBasically look into LingoDeer (btw they finally have the Thai course released now, it was delayed for a good while), Anki(Droid), Talk To Me In Korean, Learn Korean with GO! Billy Korean, et cetera.\n\nFor Chinese/Mandarin/etc. there's HelloChinese, Pleco, etc. and try visiting /r/ChineseLanguage, it's way harder to remember how to read/write in Chinese characters as you have to memorize it. Definitely make sure to prioritize SRS (spaced repetition system) stuff like Anki(Droid).\n\nIt only takes say 10 minutes a day (dedicatedly, consistently) to build up language learning skills/knowledge/etc. as a lot of us consume Korean/Chinese/etc. media daily. And as such we're just now actively using it to better understand the grammar/vocabulary.\n\nSo for some people they can may be able to understand the simpler dialogue of Kdramas, Korean variety shows, et cetera, within say 3 months or so. Maybe.",

Wow, if only her eyes weren't so uncanny or like if she went for a full zettai ryouiki look, she's for sure going to get a lot of people's votes just for that Japanese media interest.\n\nAyo, Mingyu/etc. are also into anime, my people. Wtf, forgot Suzume film was releasing, I really gotta get back into anime/manga, sigh. \n\nFor me it goes: 5 Centimeters Per Second &gt; The Garden of Words &gt; Your Name. So many missed connections, especially with my noonas.\n\nAlso that reminds me, A Silent Voice &gt; Your Name. I remember reading the one-shot of A Silent Voice, holy shit, just a decade ago back when I was in the manga/mangaka days, and it still hits like a brick. Memes helped with the sadness.\n\nSame with Jumi and Jiwon doing marathons, my fellow runners. Gotta do a marathon again soon, but I need proper calorie/nutrition intake for that, lol.\n\nAnd yo, Jimin speaks Mandarin and went to India (this reminds of when Candice Liang (Miss Hawaii, from Naked and Afraid of Love) went to Sri Lanka)? Fam, I speak a bit of Mandarin, Hindi, and Tamil too, my Catholic schools and neighborhoods be melting pots. Somebody get Ningning over here as she has to tutor another Jimin in Chinese cultural stuff. Wonder when will Ningning and Karina do ASMR in their dorm/anywhere again.\n\nSadly, cannot relate to the upcoming male catfish, I am not a &gt;!model, or am I, muahaha!&lt;, merely just a regular person. But you never know, he looks subdued in Heart Signal 4 despite all the tattoos and bad boy vibes. It'll be interesting if Jimin and Jiyoung fall for him.\n\n---\n\nLike where is the female catfish. I already saw stuff/etc. on social media but is she likely to choose between the male catfish and Mingyu or will she choose somebody else. Hmm. It's all going a bit too fast for me, lol.\n\nAs in the pacing for this Heart Signal 4 season feels a bit hurried to me, but it's probably just because I'm used to more chill shows. The biggest question of them all is if Mingyu will win over Jimin to form the visuals couple (actually the male catfish is a really good visual too), or if she will still pursue Jiwon.\n\nBtw, Jiwon really looks like Wonbin from EXchange/Transit Love 2 (\ud658\uc2b9\uc5f0\uc5602). Remember when the producers had to make incentives (https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveVillage1/comments/13o5u8p/more_people_being_exposed_as_actors_on_japanese/jl75998/) for Wonbin to go on the show?\n\nHonestly, I didn't expect the Jimin x Mingyu scene (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95SLY5leyZE&amp;t=70s) to appear so early. Wonder then when will the OTP scene (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95SLY5leyZE&amp;t=69s) with Jimin and Jiwon will happen then. Is that like their first formal date selections.\n\nAt first I thought it'd be later as there's no way they'd get that close just in the first few days, but with Jimin's personality or penchant for being daring/proactive/assertive/etc. then it's totally believable that they'd do a hug like that.\n\nFam, this Mingyu x Jimin x Jiwon timeline is crazy.",

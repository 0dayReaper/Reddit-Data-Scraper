    "postText": "Started watching the first two episodes on Viu. I love the concept and the location. The cast also seemed like they've been friends for a long time. Loved seeing Ha Jung Woo and Ju Ji Hoon as variety rookies and the younger ones Choi Min Ho and Yeo Jin Goo who are more exposed to variety shows interact with each other. And Ju Ji Hoon calling everybody \"Babies\" is everything! Will diffenitely follow this show as I've never seen this side of Ju Ji Hoon.",

Can't believe the crew didn't tell him, either. I was a bit frustrated when they finally he had to stop because he ran out of gas. The poor kid.",

If you change gears you won't even get to the point that you get too tired.\n\nAlso he said it in his interview that he didn't know about the gears.",

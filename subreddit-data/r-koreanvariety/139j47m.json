This is to show that they need to calm down and let others in cause this is rediculous. I just started 1 episode in Team 072 - Winners and had a big sigh cause it was basically putting all the most occuring faces in one go. \n\n1 Lee Kyung Kyu 16 shows\n\n2. Kim Jong Min  27 shows  \n\n3. Kang Ho Dong 31 shows\n \n4. Yang Se Chan 22 shows\n\nAre you equally tired of these faces? This is not about competence, it's the lack of variety in variety shows. This is actually making me question how this is decided behind the scenes.",

Every now and then a new face will pop up and then they are on everything, eg, Mijoo. But I think all the new talent is basically on \"new media\" like YouTube and online channels like idol+. But I agree the same faces/ jokes gets boring.",

Also they are demanded entertainers among Korean viewers with high brand reputation and their presence usually brings good ratings.\n\nP.S. I am curious to see OP's reaction after they learn that Heo Cham hosted Family Arcade for 26 years straight and Song Hae hosted National Singing Contest for 34 years until his death, and how they were popular and respected among Koreans. It seems OP doesn't understand how Korean society works and what are the dynamics of Korean variety shows.\n\nEdit 2: it seems also that OP has some hate against the particular variety stars mentioned above. Using the same logic OP applied, I have searched for relatively new variety stars filmography and the results are as follows:\n\nLee Yongjin - 31 shows\n\nLee Jinho - 22 shows\n\nJang Do Yeon - 44 shows\n\nSong Minho - 20 shows \n\nSo basically what OP says is statistically bullshit, as new faces have the same amount shows in the same time frame.",

When I mean calm down and let others in, I mean that this kind of hogging behaviour will hurt korean variety in the long haul since there are several hosts doing this, not only these who where mentioned here - when I saw them in the mentioned show it made me count. \n\nI don't know their income, but reading your comment about putting food on the table and comparing it to for instance the first host mentioned who was the highest paid entertainer in 2011, makes me wonder about greed vs putting food on the table. It could be that they earn less than other shows - do you have any reference about thier income?",

It\u2019s not a Montessori School situation where everyone who deserves a chance gets to take their turn; it is very unfair and heavily biased to those who are already successful. In Korean variety in particular, any new faces tend to be colleagues or discoveries of those already big and successful stars or people who were lucky enough to just go viral on their own. PDs and networks want their shows to do well and last for a long time, so 9/10 times that means trying to cast personalities who are already established and veterans of other successful shows; therefore you see the same 50 or so MCs and members across the board.",

Plus having a familiar face helps the audience tune in since they know they like a certain persons variety skills. An example for this for me is game caterers I don\u2019t watch episodes unless the team was someone I recognized.",

Still can't believe this is real! \n\nI really really hope they can make this version just like the older one. Times have changed, KHD is less strict, and idols have less and less freedom to tell stories and goof off, but I'm still hoping. If they can capture the hilarity of the original, it would be amazing!",

Strong Heart gives viewers and fans a chance to look into the lives of stars by listening to their stories. Many stars come on the show and share stories about their hardships in debuting, strange experiences or some other funny situations that have occurred in their lives. Celebrities have also used their time on the show to try to clear up rumors. From time to time there are also less famous stars invited so that they can have a chance to share their stories. This is important as most of the time when these stories are told on Strong Heart, it is the first time they have ever been told.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong\\_Heart\\_(TV\\_series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Heart_(TV_series))\n\nLike a talk show with a LOT of idol casts back then but everyone one-upping each other with even more embarassing/crazy/insane funny/emotional stories. Kang Ho Dong was a menace (affectionate) trying to push details out of celebrities making them embarrassed. A lot of funny and memorable TMIs have come out of this show, it was a show that really showcased how real #human even our idols are (they sneak out of dorms to go to amusement parks, they fart on bus full of other idols, they went on blind dates (guess which gg tmis these are \ud83d\ude02))",

I have seen few clips of the show in other variety show and saw that many famous idols like SNSD, SuJu, 2PM regularly starred in the show. That itself is a big task. I wonder if they will be able to pull similar star guests during current YouTube era where all idols have multiple social media platforms and websites to reach out tot heir fans. I'm definitely looking forward to it though.",

JTBC has an all star studded lineup of judges for Peak Time, i'd imagine they could easily book 2nd gen idols if they're free. I feel like the bigger question is whether the 3rd/4th gen idols who get invited to these shows will be able to reveal the same level of insane tmis that previous gen idols did. Also there's definitely gonna be companies who are hesitant to have their idols on the show so that's definitely a challenge as well.",

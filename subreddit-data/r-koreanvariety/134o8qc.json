Plus he meant well w the suggestion that makgeoli doesn't go w the food and to include wine.\n\nAnyways, John Park's def an asset. Fluent in English and made an effort to learn Italian.  Him ordering at the butcher's one of the highlights of this ep for me. \n\nAlso good job on hiring pro-active part timers. Funny when they were made to eat at the front to attract customers",

The rest of the cast could not do much beyond greetings, similar to the cast in The Genius Paik (excluding John).\n\nPaik is aware about the language barrier though and the need to speak in the local tongue, which is why his strategy is not to attempt broken Arabic/Italian  (it might create problems if you get further questions, or speak it wrongly) but to hire bilingual part-timers who can communicate with the staff as well as the local crowd. This concept is unique &amp; very different from the shows you mentioned, where the cast have no one else to rely on to communicate.\n\nWhat's similar though is that both Wooshik and these part-timers are in customer-facing roles, which is what necessitates a basic command of the local language. But if you're in the kitchen, like Seojun/Taehyung/Yumi or Paik/Jang Woo/Yuri, it's not that crucial. In fact, Seojin, the boss in Jinny's Kitchen, did not attempt to learn or communicate in Spanish despite being in a front-facing role, which I found much weirder.\n\nAnyway Paik never bans his staff from speaking the local languages. He only encourages them to speak more in front of customers, which in their case means to communicate loudly in Korean, since that's their native tongue. His rationale is that it shows that they're authentic (by being foreign) and also encourages, in a strange way, a cultural exchange. If you noticed, because they kept speaking in Korean, some customers tried to imitate Annyeong Haseyo and grew curious about the Korean names for the dishes they tried. It's unusual to us because we're used to an assimilation strategy (learning the local ways) but his is more a hybrid where you have locals onboard but also emphasise your own culture.",

            "comment": "Good episode. Agree with Yuki\\_karase that the old man got an evil edit in the teaser. Stupid reality TV BS tactics. It should be banned to do that with real people (not characters). You'd think SK would agree given how awful their bullying, public court of opinion and suicide issues are. \n\nAnyways, I don't have much new to say that I didn't say last week. Spicy pork is a great choice but Ssam isn't where it's at. Too many steps that raise the barrier of entry and will scare off people who haven't already been introduced to SK food, which almost every customer they had in this episode had already been. It's not a \"win\" to just pull in the customers who are into Korea and have been there. Those aren't the masses, those are a specific subset who you can't sustain a business on. \n\nYou want food that is easy to understand that requires no special steps or knowledge. Giving the Italians that homework of how to eat it? Not in Naples. So far they are getting a lot of old Italian foot traffic and the restaurant location doesn't seem to be in a spot where the youth of the city go (aka it's not a trendy/young area). The youth are at least are more open, experimental and cultured so they'd be more open to trying something new and not be such traditionalists about flavor and styles. But if you're getting a lot of the older generations of Italians you're getting purists, snobs and uncultured people. Tons of Italians who have never left Italy or at least never left Europe. If the show was say in Mexico they could easily just say \"it's like a taco, but the shell is lettuce\" and they'd get it, easy. But in Naples? Lower the barrier of entry. Bowl of spicy pork with vegies, bowl of rice, bowl of beef radish soup and a seafood pajeon. Eat it however you want, no special instructions. \n\nRegardless though, gotta realize you'll probably never have much success there. Being the first Korean restaurant in Naples? Unless you're doing say K-BBQ or K-fried chicken, you're gonna need to be playing the LONG game. Slowly winning over locals, advertising heavily to the youth of Naples and advertising in Asian hot spots so that every East Asian in Naples knows there's an authentic South Korean restaurant at that location.",

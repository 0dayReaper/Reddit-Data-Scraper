I loved that Hodong guy ;)\n\nI have never watched korean content, so i have no idea what to watch next. All i know is that im really impressed by how koreans do things, so if any of you could suggest some similar (or even different) shows  i'd really appreciate it.",

They have a few seasons each, with a different cast each time.\n\nOn the other hand, if you liked the cast, their interactions, the humour and such, I'd recommend New Journey to the West! You'll find Hondong in this one. It is probably the funniest korean show I have seen, and my personal favourite. I introduced my partner to korean shows with this too, and I cannot recommend it enough.\n\nWhatever you end up watching, hope you have loads of fun!",

Try \"2 Days 1 Night\". \n\nIt introduces different places in Korea, including scenery, food, specialties etc. And one big element is game. Hodong was in season 1 of this long running and beloved show in Korea. The PD loves tormenting the cast with difficult games and penalties. A few signature games include trying to pick between fish sauce drink and coffee, jumping into water (wherever they happen to be in) in the dead of winter, and being dropped from the middle of the journey where they've to find their own way to base camp.",

It is a variant of a talk show with different guests every week, but its strong point is the strong chemistry between the regular cast.\n\nIt got more sterile and formulaic as years went on and it became extremely popylar, but at the beginning it was fantastic. \n\nWitty, no holds-barred banter with a lot of teasing between the regular members (and even guests!).\n\nI can heartily recommend any episode between 17 to about 130/140 (although, depending on the guest, you might like some of the later ones as well).",

            "comment": "I'm glad you had enjoyed 'The Great Escape'. I enjoyed this variety show too.\n\nI think another similar type of variety show would be 'Busted' which is avaliable on Netflix. However, I would say that 'Busted' felt more scripted than 'Great Escape' in my opinion. But the concept is more or less there, where the cast members have to escape within the time limit through solving the puzzles.\n\nThe other one would be 'The Zone' which is avaliable on Disney Plus. That show requires the cast members to hold out for a certain period of time at a location while trying to survive at the location.\n\nThere are also lots of famous variety shows out there, but maybe for a start I would recommend you:\n\n- Running Man (airs on SBS every Sunday) --&gt; this is one of the longest running variety show that is also very popular overseas. But this variety show have may have lots of talking here and there. They also have different missions weekly and games to play, but I would say there isn't a legit fixed concept they follow these days. I would recommend you watching from the 1st ep. \n\n- Infiinte Challenge (aired on MBC) --&gt; this is another famous variety show that had ended. But you can watch back the old eps. They are actually quite fun to watch.\n\n- 2D1N (airs on KBS every Sunday) --&gt; this show is where the cast members will go to different places in Korea and discover different locations and food. The most famous part about this show is where the casts will have to play various games to compete to either get to eat lunch/ dinner or sleep indoor or outdoor.\n\nDepend on what genre you like I can recommend others too. Since there are just too many shows to recommend.",

            "comment": "Wow it is so rare that someone new to Korean varieties loves Hodongi from the start lol. I love him too since 2 days 1 night season 1 times. \n\nAs everyone mentioned already stat with New Journey to the West. As season 1 and 2 are a little bit shout out to 2D1N, it might be hard to get inner jokes, references etc., I suggest to start with season 3 and after getting acquainted with show premise, cast dynamics and jokes go back to earlier seasons. \n\nAlso I would suggest to watch Knowing Bros, but from episode 17 onwards when they changed the format to Brother School. Even though KB is not good these days, it was brilliant and super funny at the beginning. Hodong might be loud and cringe sometimes, but it is his charm that gets me in lol. \n\nAlso if you want the show solely focused on Hodong (I like him in pair with Lee Sugeun most tho) then watch Ramyeonator in Channel Shiboya aka Fullmoon Channel. It is also funny, and Hodong eats a lot as usual haha.\n\nIf you prefer brain gearing shows, then go with The Genius, I think it is one of the best intellectual show I have ever watched and it is also from the same PD as The Great Escape. You can also try Crime Scene, all seasons, it is a brilliant and entertaining show, which hooks you up from episode 1. There is also Season 4 coming soon after 6 years break, so it is worth to watch it before that.",

Old-school Hodong was much louder and as he is a perfectionist, his shows like Star King for example, was taking up to 10-12 hours to shoot. But for me I loved him both, pre and after scandal too. As he is usually loud and obnoxious type, and loves to be in the center of attention people don't like him that much. Especially seeing him first and not knowing his character, his energy might be too much for some people lol.\n\nBut anyway I am glad that you liked him much and totally agree that without him TGE would not be the same. So if you watch the show for him, definitely watch his other shows. 2D1N for pre scandal Hodong, NJTTW for after scandal Hodong.",

He was only in 1st season until his controversy, which basically ended after that. This show was created by Na PD, and it was super popular at the time with ratings above 50%. Season 1 has around 230 episodes, depending on your location all of them are available in KBS World YouTube Channel (episodes are shortened from the original for about 30 mins each). Season 3 of 2D1N has totally different cast, but aside from controversy that ended it, it was also vastly popular and hilarious as season 1. \n\nAfter Hodong's controversy and prove of his innocence he decided to cancel his retirement and comeback to the TV. Even though his popularity decreased in comparison to previous years due to him being away from entertainment for a long time, he did successful comeback to entertainment again together with Na PD. The new show was New Journey to the West (NJTTW) and featured Hodong and other 3 members from 2D1N season 1. 2D1N's main concept was traveling inside the Korea, but NJTTW, as name suggests, goes to travel abroad. Season 1 of NJTTW basically was unofficial continuation of season 1 of 2D1N with some changes. So I suggested you to start with NJTTW. But season 1 and season 2 might have a little bit unfamiliar setting for you, because they have more inner jokes from 2D1N. Start with season 3 of NJTTW, not 2D1N. Then if you are interested continue with season 1 and 2. NJTTW also has spin-off show which is called Kang's kitchen, where Hodong is main chef and other members of NJTTW are helpers and together they run a restaurant. NJTTW has 8 seasons in total, with each being around 10-12 episodes per each. Kang's Kitchen has 3 seasons with 4-6 episodes each. \n\nSo basically after you will watch NJTTW, you will get their jokes and will have more familiarity with format and members. After if you crave more you can switch to Na PD's YouTube channel and watch spin-offs of the NJTTW or other shows of members.",

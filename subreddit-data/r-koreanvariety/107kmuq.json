Nevertheless, a new some kind of an arc we get to see this 2023 xD.\n\nPoor seonho, was already close to getting 3 answers but didn't manage to accomplish it. At least, he gets to fulfill his wish kekw.\n\nJongmin making use of checking the house as an alibi to stay away from cold is peak for me xd + plus them wasting their 10 mins advantage due to them going the other direction xdddd",

There are so many laugh out loud funny moments with this crew, I just can't get enough. \n\nI also love when the boys get the crew involved, like when they asked the jimmy jib guy for a hint on the quiz. It just feels good to see these interactions and how the 2D1N family is so much bigger than the just cast and PDs.",

It's true that it's the last trip for 2022, the recent filming and 1st filming for 2023 was on Jan 6th (last week). I think Seon Ho mean the donation during previous filming, I'm not sure what his exact words but sometimes subtitles can be confusing",

    "postText": "I just saw Kyung Soo jin's first episode of I Live Alone and absolutely fell in love with how she approaches everyday life.  I looked up what other episodes she's in but somehow, I only saw that one episode recorded on the show's wiki page.  I'd love if someone could let me know the other episodes where she's featured.  Thanks!",

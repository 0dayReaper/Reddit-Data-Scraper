    "postText": "This was mostly contained in r/kpop because it was a musical issue, but it looks like it's going to affect entertainment as well. \n\nLee Seunggi stated he received zero payment for his music career from Hook Entertainment, which he was with for 18 years. After talking with other singers older than him, he asked Hook for a detailed list of revenue and costs for all his music work to prove that he didn't make any revenue as a singer.\n\nIt turns out that the CEO gaslighted him by saying he provided negative revenue for his singing career, while evidence suggests she may have used that revenue for personal spending.\n\nThe reason this links to entertainment is that Hook Entertainment has been involved as a co-producer to Master in the House season 1. The contract has expired when the season ended, but Seunggi says he feels like he can't trust anyone and feels uncomfortable participating in a 2nd season. \n\nIt's understandable since the CEO was caught saying \"I'm going to kill him (Seunggi). I'm going to stake my name and kill him\". \n\nThis post excludes some events that occurred in the timeline, and there's been almost daily articles about it since it's started. I can answer questions for folks who haven't followed the story as much as I can. \n\nrecent sources:\nhttps://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=468&amp;aid=0000904763&amp;cid=1073789\n\nhttps://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=396&amp;aid=0000630625\n\ntldr: Seunggi got scammed by his agency from his singing career, feels uncomfortable pursuing MitH 2 due to agency's co-producer involvement in season 1",

There are some interesting stories out there and good reason why parents used to not want their kids to go into the entertainment field. \n\nThere is also the commonly known practice in the 00s &amp; 10s of idols and actresses having sponsors aka-  prostitution (sometimes underage and probably forced).  I wouldn't be surprised in the least if this is still happening (or if you told me it was going on longer than that). \n\nSo yeah,  slapping someone around totally seems possible if not downright normal.

I've been following this scandal since it's started and it's hard to put into context how long Hook has been lying to Seunggi, but I'll put some examples here. \n\nThey've been taking away his pay for close to 18 years, which is around the time *2D1N S1* aired. Just think about how *long* ago that was! I've seen some reports about how Hook's CEO has tons of connections across the industry, and is friends with Na PD. He's been lied to since his debut, from Strong Heart to MITH, he's been lied through it all. I honestly wouldn't blame him if he takes the profits and leaves the entertainment business bc that kind of psychological tramua would seriously mess a guy up. \n\nI don't know how far the lying trail goes (so far the only one confirmed to not know anything was his manager and some of Hook's new employees) but I wouldn't be surprised if others in the industry knew about this and just kept thier mouths shut (Istg, if Na PD is one of those, idk what I'll do).",

                            "comment": "Exactly! One of the ways Seunggi was able to find out that he wasn't getting paid properly seemed like it was by accident as well. Because one of the producers of his songs mentioned that they still get paid from Seunggi's song(s) till this day. I'd imagine they have never talked about it before or they only got connected again with each other recently and had a discussion. That's how Seunggi probably found out and when Seunggi heard all that, he was probably confused and felt betrayed and decided to investigate because for the last 18 years he was loyal to his past agency and really thought his singing career was bad. When in fact Seunggi had so many hits that are still played and covered till today. It's no wonder he rarely put out much music even though everyone loved him as a singer. I always just thought he preferred acting and variety shows more. But now that all this has come to light, it's just sad that he got used. That's how you know he was really kind. I mean 18 years that's like half his life with them, only to find out they were taking advantage of him. The people who were gaining something from it probably knew and that's why they kept quiet. But I'm sure there are others that have no clue and may have been just as clueless as Seunggi. I mean it took Seunggi 18 years to find out so I'm guessing it is only a very select few that knew about it and would never tell because they were gaining from it. At least Seunggi's long time manager is on his side and was smart to collect evidence. Seunggi and his manager left Hook together and started his new one man agency. I'm sure betrayal like this hit him harder because on his part he was too kind and trusting. So I understand why he would have major trust issues now. He doesn't know who's guilty and who had no clue just like him.",

In 15 years one would think music career was one of their topic of discussion, especially with Jiwon and Jongmin there, so it's surprising he was enlightened only recently. \n\nIf i understood correctly, Seunggi wouldnt have known if not for the text mistake, so I assume he was gaslighted to steer clear of discussing it with his peers. Also, its unclear as of now how hook used Seunggi as leverage or whatever politics went on, so hopefully no one else was involved. It will be sad to lose his talent over this but i wont blame him if he decides to go on hiatus/retire altogether.",

The gaslighting was so far bad that he just assumed his singing career was doomed and would never create revenue. Probably why he pursued acting and entertainment as much as he did. But he still loved singing, which is why his Youtube channel still includes his singing.",

And now she's saying she didn't know the company was taking ALL his music revenue when she was a Director at the company and directly responsible for his music career happening at all??? Really difficult to believe.\n\nI'm sad that I'm not surprised to find out he's been exploited by these people since day one. It seemed like a situation ripe for exploitation.",

After talking with other singers older than him, he asked Hook for a detailed list of revenue and costs for all his music work to prove that he didn't make any revenue as a singer.\n\nLet's just calmed down and not jumped the gun on everyone famous that close wth LSG, as mentioned above LSG are getting paid in other line of work (Acting n variety) the CEO just leveraging him for his music work. He might not even discussed it with his peers because he legit believe he aren't able to make money out of music endeavours",

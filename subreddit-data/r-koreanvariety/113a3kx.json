                    "comment": "The SL teams was heavy on strikers and basically one defender and even that she was not the best one in SL. They could have selected Yubin or Eva to fill that defender/midfielder role. Seogi could fill the midfielder role but looks like she was playing injured. But the first goal of SL team was beautiful and scary. It showed how deadly they were when three tops strikers moved in-sync.\n\nKyeong Hee was pure talent and will be crazy good next season with training. Looking forward to FC Gucheok making a run next season.\n\nSeung Hye will still need to play the midfield/defender position position for FC Gaeven since they do not have an effective strikers (with the current line up). Once they learn proper positioning, I think a lot more play will open for her. Hoping that the next coach will utilize that in order to make them competitive in SL.\n\nIs it going to be a barn-burner for SL team in the next episode? Is that why SBS split the game into two episodes? I am excited to see who the coaches are going to be for next season (where they will be assigned)?",

HeIn is good but she was not used to playing the tiki taka style. A lot of miss chance in the earlier second half to open up the defense because she held the ball too long. And it also seems that she is not as confidence as the like of BoGyung, where she always missed the timing of taking a shot and when to extend the play. It was good thing that Naty was used to the buildup play and help opening up the defense, and so was KyeongHee. HeIn is so used to carrying her team all season long where she doe not have to do that with this team. It was also evident in all her all star games so far.",

            "comment": "It was an entertaining match. Putting both leagues side by side really shows the difference of skills between these two leagues. Skill, speed and shooting are clearly showcased on the Super Leagues players. Where as resiliency and power are definitely the characteristics of Challenge League players. SLs are offense heavy, and CLs are defense heavy.\n\nSo far, the CL players showed that even though they were lacked in skills. the understanding of playing as a team and making up for each players deficiency made this game an exciting one. SL players may have the skills, but lack of understanding of positioning seems obvious among the players that is so used to the own team styles. HeIn may have been an incredible player but still lacking the sense of flow of the game. Maybe the next coach for Actionista can in still these traits for them next season. TopGirls, WorldClass and Gucheok players showed their understanding of team play and positioning with a masterclass performance. PSY is still Thanos no matter what team she is on, showed that she is another class on her own. No matter what position you put her in, she is always a scary player (pure madness!).\n\nAyumi played her worst game since the game with WonderWoman in season 1 of CL (played with back injuries). Two earlier easy goals were uncharacteristic of her performance. Still can't believe Anaconda will not be playing in next season looking at YoonJu performance. Balladream is going to run havoc in CL next season.\n\nShowing the players's families in the stand was also a nice touch by the show. You can see how proud and scared they were with their daughters performances. Great part 1 eposide so far!",

            "comment": "Thoughts:\n\n1. The quality of the game (mainly offensively) was so good. Really wish the show could maintain its skill growth of the players (by maintaining the cast) so this level of play becomes the norm. Basically the three things that are happening which make the game so fun to watch are: 1) good positioning 2) good passing 3) good crosses. It's not like we're seeing anyone break ankles with individual ball skills (Lee Jung-eun style), it's just fundamental stuff. \n2. Damn, the production team (camera operator &amp; editor) sure love that pretty blonde woman in the stands. Lol. They cut to her for reaction shots a ton. \n3. Yoon Ju putting on a clinic and Taejin getting the most love from the audience only for the show to have sent their team, Anaconda, to the basement for all of next season... -slaps forehead-. Unless we get a miracle (spin-off series), I still say suspension is a giant mistake. Not only will the show be missing one of its top stars/fan favs (Taejin), but her and her teammates (like Yoon Ju) are at risk for leaving the show due to the suspension and even if they don't, the reduced if not eliminated development from practices and games will just put Anaconda even further behind the other Challenge league teams in terms of development. (Shout out to Haley in this game too).\n4. I'm really, really happy they increased the time per half so each group got to play for 15 minutes instead of the normal 10. I was hoping for that change. \n5. The crowd being there is fun and likely really helps make the experience more fun and uplifting for the players. I feel like the better you can make it for them the higher the odds they want to stay on the show. However, I just don't see how they can have audiences in the future for regular games considering the real risk of spoilers getting out onto the internet. I'm fine with audiences being a special occasion thing.",

Think they missed out on Yoon Ji only starting to play striker so late would have made a huge difference and she would have been so much better than now just through getting more game time there \n\nDidn't think of the spoiler issue would suck only show I look forward to each week.

They need to figure out another form of punishment, or add two more teams to make it more competitive. Keeping the team intact and keeping their skills will definitely cause the team issue when they come back. Just look at FC GukdaeFam. A total rubbish team now, just by not being able to keep them intact. Hoping for a twist regarding FC Anaconda.\n\nAll in all it was a fun game with the crowds and families, which added excitement and pressure for the players to play their best game. But I know logistically it would not be possible to have them all the time. Just have crowds during special match like All Star is good idea.",

That new team, personality-wise, looks like a lot of fun. I'm glad they will be on the show. However, a suspension is so harsh when it means no more team practices, no more games (for game reps) and most likely no more tv show $$$. I doubt the production pays the suspended team to not be on the show. Even if they are getting paid, all that time not playing could lead to them booking another gig or just enjoying not playing anymore and that lead to them leaving the show. \n\nI still say the best fix isn't a different punishment or two more teams but create a spin-off show (they've already made two) for the suspended team each season. They get specialized training and instruction and play scrimmage matches against amateur futsal teams for game reps. That means the worst team on the show (the suspended team) gets a helping hand, training-wise, and also gets to keep being on TV. The suspended team should come back the following season either on track or upgraded in terms of their skills which helps prevent the same team getting suspended over and over, each time getting further and further left behind in their development.",

I guess too many players are good enough from SL to play in an all star match. I think it also is good to give other players experience playing in this game. Have to give at least one spot to FC Gukdae even though she was not even as good as any of the CL all star players.",

**(BD 3)** steps in with a power shot attempt that is aimed down the middle but **(NF 9- GK)** tracks down and blocks and smothers, a great sequence of frantic play, another VAR review is called for a hand ball foul, another penalty kick is awarded, now **(BD 10)** is the shooter, same goalie **(NF 9- GK)**, BD really needs a goal to close the score gap!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' BD Miss: **(BD

GK)** pressuring her, the shot HITS THE BOTTOM RIGHT GOAL POST!!!! and deflects out of bounds for a goal kick.  I swear i thought this would be a goal for BD, looks like BD might be the AN of this season with no luck bouncing their way and suspension very likely!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' NF SUB: **(NF 11)** subs off for **(NF 123)**!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!10' BD GOAL: **(BD 10)** takes a corner kick with a back pass to **(BD 3)** who shoots on target to the near mid right side with **(BD 27)** barely getting out of the way of the shot with her cutting run towards the net, great shot, **(NF 9- GK)** was a bit slow on the reaction but the shot was perfect, **Coach DaeSe** is emotional and crying tears of joy for his players!&lt;\n\nHALFTIME SCORE LINE: &gt;!------- BD 1 - 2 NF------------, BD missing 2 penalty shots really is disappointing wasted opportunity.  Will we see more desperation from BD?  will NF continue to play well with their set piece?!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~10' NF SUB: **(NF 123)** subs off for **(NF 11)** before the half starts!&lt; \n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' NF Foul: **(BD 27)** steals the ball from **(NF 11)** and tries to cut down the right wing side but **(NF 690)** trips her up with foot on foot contact and a yellow card is issued to **(NF 690)**, direct free- kick is located close to the right wing side!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' BD Miss: **(BD 10)** takes the direct free kick with a shot on target that goes between the two players of NF's defensive wall, but **(NF 9- GK)** was in position to save the ball with a clean catch with no rebound!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' NF Foul: **(BD 30)** and **(NF 11)** try to track down a deep throw pass from **(NF 9- GK)**, **(NF 11)** steps into **(BD 10)** and **(BD 10)** falls to the ground, **(BD 10)** had position, **(NF 11)** was focused on the ball and ran into **(BD 10)**, free kick awarded to BD in their zone!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' NF Miss: **(BD 3)** takes the free kick with a pass down the left wing that is intercepted by **(NF 17)** she dribbles down the wing and manages to get a shot on net that misses **(BD 3)**'s block attempt, **(BD 24- GK)** gets her foot on the ball and picks it up slowly!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' NF Foul: **(BD 10)** tries to cross the ball and **(NF 17)** gets incidental contact on her arm for a hand ball foul, a direct free kick is awarded on the NF side of the centre circle!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' NF Miss: **(BD 27)** takes a sideline kick-in with a cross that **(NF 17)** heads away, the ball moves towards BD territory, that **(BD 3)** one-time kicks a low roller to **(BD 10)** who one-time passes to the left wing side through 3 NF defenders, **(BD 27)** runs to the ball with a touch on her left foot that brings the ball to her right foot for a shot on target that is a weak roller that **(NF 9- GK)** smothers, what a great display of passing but no finish!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' BD Miss: **(BD 10)** takes a corner kick-in with a set piece #2 called, she crosses to the middle with a **(BD 27)** running a route towards the goal mouth, 3 NF defenders collapse on **(BD 27)** so she doesn't get a re-direction but the ball is deflected towards BD territory where **(BD 3)** winds up for a shot on target that **(NF 690)** gets a header on, she continues the play with a strong dribble down the left wing, nothing is developed with this run as BD defense run back into position with desperation!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' BD Miss: **(BD 27)** takes a sideline kick-in with a rolling cross pass for **(BD 3)** who gets a shot off that is bouncy and aimed for the bottom right corner and gets through BD and NF players standing in front of the NF goal, **(NF 9- GK)** is alert and manages to smother the ball, **Coach DaeSe** calls a time-out for some different strategies, **(BD 24)** is no longer goalie, and **(BD 95- GK)** wears the goalie gloves, is this a smart move?!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' BD Miss: **(BD 3)** takes a sideline kick-in with a cross that **(NF 17)** blocks with a header but doesn't get the follow up deflection, **(BD 10)** steals the ball with a trap and dekes out **(NF 17)** for a shot on target aimed for the wide bottom right corner, **(NF 9- GK)** comes up big with a diving smothering ball catch!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' Injury Stoppage: **(BD 10)** takes a corner kick-in with a cross that **(NF 690)** and **(BD 3)** attempt to gain possession, however, both players collide and both fall hard, looks like **(BD 3)** set a hard pick like in basketball where **(NF 690)** ran straight into **(BD 3)**, **(BD 7)** tries to run and wants to run but everyone tells her not to, **(BD 3)** gets issued a yellow card for setting a screen!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' NF Miss: **(NF 17)** takes a sideline kick-in with a shot on target that hits BD defensive wall set up by **(BD 27)** and the deflection goes towards the net but missing the target by a foot to the middle left side post, **(BD 95- GK)** was tracking the ball well!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' NF Miss: **(NF 17)** takes a sideline kick-in with a cross to the BD goal mouth area that **(BD 3)** blocks, a huge rebound drops  that **(NF 690)** shoots but misses the target badly when aiming for the near bottom right corner!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' BD Miss: **(BD 27)** takes a sideline kick-in with a cross that hits NF defensive wall set up by **(NF 11)**, the ball deflects to the middle where **(BD 3)** one-time volleys her first touch, the ball drops to **(BD 10)** who is tightly marked by **(NF 1)**, she boxes her out and spins to take a shot on net that manages to get by the help defense of **(NF 17)**, the ball goes wide right, **(NF 9- GK)** was tracking the ball well!&lt;\n\n\nFINAL SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- BD 1 - **2 NF**------------, NF comes up big with a 2-1 win, will BD get suspended? we will have to see the result of next week's game to find out who will be the bottom ranked team, great effort from a BD that didn't have KyungSeo playing any minutes, Kassy, Tak, Lisa, SeoGi, and MinSeo showed great passion, but just like Anaconda last season, the ball wasn't bouncing their way, missing on TWO penalty kicks will be the most painful, looks like **HeeJeong** is the top scorer now with a total of three goals scored. Good competitve game that BD came short, Coach DaeSe is taking the loss harder than his players, perhaps this will motivate him to learn more and get better at coaching, BD needs WW to destroy SF for BD to get out of the basement!&lt;\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!WW v SF, BD will need SF to lose by two goals to get out of the basement, the match looks to be physical and competitive, even the coaches are pushing each other on the sidelines!&lt;",

Some tackles are becoming ridiculous \n\n&gt;!Does no one talk about how underwhelming Seogi is? No offence, but she is probably the most overrated player on the show. The broadcast always try to hype her up ever since Song So Hee's gone. But she in fact is not quite the MVP level of player. Her kick ins are below average, shootings are weak and inaccurate. And she can't dribble a long distance. When the team needed her the most, it was Minseo who showed up and played her heart out to lead the team. Multiple times Seogi just sat back and watch Minseo counter attack alone. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Still, when will we get to see the full power of Kyungseo, Seogi, Minseo unleashed. At this rate, before we get to see them playing together on field, one of them might already left the show!&lt;",

She will always need a second player to complement her.\n\nBalladdream now has the time to rethink and reorganize their style. Heavy reliance on KyeongSeo for offense killed the team in the end. They need to decide what MinSeo's role will be going forward. She will need a lot of field experience to be a third option for their offenses. She played okay, but wasted too much energy needlessly.",

The problem is the team only having 2 people attacking namely her and minseo with the other 2 not crossing the halfway line. They are always outnumbered up front, also minseo is fully marked by minji who is prettty sneaky because she is always holding onto her jersey. She is a playmaker sort of player , you cant really see her value unless she has people to work with.",

                    "comment": "Sorry if my grammar is bad, but for me Soegi  still the best player after Song So Hee. When NatFam won the competition they had good GK, best defense, best counter attack, best teammates, they had all the good attributes of a winning team. Look at BD now: 1 new player in the middle of the season, no GK, and lots of injuries. Come on, it's not fair to Soegi.\n\nShe is a Regista like Jorginho and Pirlo who needs Kante and Gattuso. All 3 BD Goals contributed by Soegi, 1G/2A. No one has yet reached Soegi's level of breaking down defenses with passes, controlling and distributing the ball and releasing pressure. Soegi and So Hee are good in their own way, So Hee with her sprint, dribble and finish and Soegi with her throughpass, vision and control. It's really not fair, if we force So Hee to play like Soegi too. Soegi only needs a partner, a player who can keep up with him like Kyungseo in BD, Sun Young in the All Star game. She doesn't need to shoot every ball, because that's not her job. She didn't need to press every time because it wasn't her job. Her job was simply to ensure that she gave herself and her team as many chances as possible.\n\nXavi needs Iniesta to win in the midfield area.",

They know exactly when to 1-touch pass it to eachother and when to move into spaces. And thats really hard to learn, except for some players like MiRa and PSY (bestie striker-trequartista partnership :P) I haven't seen other newbies becoming that good tactically...",

I swear there were so many falls and big hits, but I guess that's just the way the Challenge League is. \n\n&gt;!MinSeo showing why she shouldn't be stuck as goalie, she literally ran up and down the entire pitch multiple times showing some good positioning in the box as well as some great defending. They finally have another good field player with MinSeo, but so unlucky they weren't able to link up with KyungSeo. I really believe that KyungSeo+Seogi+MinSeo would be the MSN of the league and would be able to create so many chances and goals against almost every team on this show.!&lt; \n\n&gt;!This game was 100% winnable if KyungSeo wasn't injured, it's really a shame but on the other hand, missing 2 penalty kicks is just unacceptable. Really don't understand having MoonTak taking the first PK, she might be good at practice, but she's shown she's not able to show up during the actual games. Don't get me wrong, she had a great goal, but I swear she just kicks as hard as she can and hopes to god it just gets somewhat near the goal.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!This game really showed that Balladream isn't able to execute without KyungSeo, she is their best player as well as the captain/leader. Without her, there was no loud voice on the team that could rally the team together and make the comeback happen. A lot of the balls that they weren't able to finish in the box definitely could've been easy goals for KyungSeo.!&lt;\n\nOne little thing that has nothing to do with the players, but with the coach that irked me- &gt;!crying after scoring 1 goal being down 2-1 still in the first half? I get you're happy and you feel for the players, but you're still losing and there's so much time left. You have to be mentally stronger for the players' sake, just felt a little weak mentally and I'm sure the players were slightly caught off guard.!&lt;",

He wasn't out of control or a big mess, he cried during the celebration, none of the on field players seemed to notice, Kyoung Seo teased him and then he wiped it away and got back to business by the time play was resuming. I fail to see any failure in coaching on his part. There are all sorts of potential reasons we don't know about as to why it was so emotional for him. Don't say stuff where you end up feeling bad when you found out the full story and it makes you realize he had a really good reason to be that emotional. You never know what was done or said behind the scenes between coach and players or coach and family or anything that would make crying very understandable.",

But the fact that he is crying after scoring 1 goal being down 2-0 in the FIRST HALF is just something that shows his inexperience as a coach. Also keep in mind that I'm talking specifically from a football point of view, imagine any big league coach doing that in any sport, they would get grilled by the media and the fans. \n\n\n&gt; Don't say stuff where you end up feeling bad when you found out the full story and it makes you realize he had a really good reason to be that emotional.

Just look at where we are at now.\n\nThat is why most of us have been saying, it is most important to have all six players fully functional to make a competitive and durable team. All the bench players need to be field tested and match hardened so that they can be helpful in any capacity, even a minimal one. They need to get their \"touches\" and awareness of the game. One player down, especially the core one, suddenly the team looks like a rookie team, running around with its head cut off.\n\nAnd coach(s), if you expect a fast game, then all your players should be fast and have the stamina to carry that game. How do you expect to pull a set piece, kick in, or corner kick, with only one player running wild into the defensive zone.  All those wasted energy, without any threat, what so ever. Poor MinSeo. You expect her to carry the team after all this time playing as a keeper. And they were going against a weaker team too.\n\nTwo missed penalties are just a travesty, especially when you know that you have no offensive capabilities at all. No long range power kicker, no speed-rush player. Balladdream was coming into the battle, with no weapon in their arsenal. Seogi is a good player, but without somebody helping her, she was basically useless.\n\nNow, their chances of taking a needed break is clearer, if FC Streaming decided to go \"first match style\". Mentally, they are more stable than FC WonderWoman. Next week match could go \"streaming\" way.\n\nBy the way, how do I love the interaction between SeoHyun and her husband, Coach TaeSae. It is just hilarious. Best moment of this week match/episode.",

Not that I think she should be stuck, but I didn't see enough skill there as is to be worth reducing the quality of goalie by a lot in order to add her to Kyungseo and Seogi on the field. There was no choice really in this match or else they'd effectively have had just Seogi on offense but when Kyungseo and Seogi are out there, the best thing they can have is an elite goalie which is what Minseo is. \n\nNow if they get demoted and they have all those months to train, sure, maybe you have Minseo train a ton on the field to upgrade her individual skills and you work on getting your goalie, Lisa, as competent as possible. That could work.",

We saw what happen to Balladream, and even TopGirl.

We have seen and I have been saying the importance of the GK is massive NatFam won because of there GK and I do concede that Minseo is there best field player after SeoGi and KyungSeo but then they should have started another keeper from the beginning.\n\nI also think Tak was there best player this game she was immense in both attackb and defence.\n\nDo think that if NatFam don't change players next season they look like they have some really good player that are starting the improve rapidly and work together next season they are my favourite right now",

BD never had a solid defense tho it seems Moon Tak at least improved a bit and could aid in setpieces. It was always their tiki taka offense with Seogi and Kyungseo that made them frightening which made this match up skew very heavily in NatFam's favor. As a result, the match went about as well as expected. NatFam also improved enough with Heejung and Mihae for the offensive and \"lucked out\" in getting Seohyun who VASTLY improved as a gk. Right now, her and Kisum seem to be the best gk in terms of overall ability and potential for growth especially since old fan favorites like Ayumi, Irene, and Hyesun are either gone or got much worse this tourney. Seeing Daese cry and Kyungseo try to run while limping knowing their team is very likely to be relegated hurts but hopefully this gives them the motivation to not rely too much on Kyungseo/Seogi and to actually try to get a good defensive line going.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Next match looks fun. If you had asked me before this tourney started which team was likely to be relegated and which to be promoted, I would've told you WW and BD respectively, but this is where we're at now. Streaming Fighter has my fav coach and there's a lot of new sides we've yet to see from them but WW has improved leaps and bound from those days of having replaced many members and ending up with only Gayoung having some promise so ultimately, my bet's on them. Kisum stuck out like a sore thumb before her ascension to a god-tier gk (within the confines of Shooting Star ofc) and now I am genuinely excited to see her block balls that would've easily led to a goal in other matches w/ other gks. Ofc while WW's defense is very solid now and Gayoung finishes well enough, unless Amy improves enough to support her or practice enough to pull off setpieces which Gayoung isn't the best at, if they do get promoted, I don't see it as enough to win against the top SL teams. Although with how much Shooting Stars has promoted the FA cup and with how Anaconda has been in the dungeons for so long, this FA cup will probably be an interesting battleground to see how these CL teams stack up against the SL. It might just be the biggest upset we've seen in all of Shooting Stars history if we continue with how crazy the matches this season has been.!&lt;\n\nedit: typos.",

                            "comment": "That's true, and given how the overall athleticism in SF is high, I could see them winning; it's not like the odds are heavily stacked against SF after all. Not to mention my predictions this season have mostly been wrong so I wouldn't really trust my gut with a 10 ft pole. Still with all that said, SF's last game showed that Juyeon/1weekdieter has a pretty big flaw in her gk skills. While she saves grounders well and likes/is good at punching out balls that would normally go in, her reaction to balls close to the goal is SLOW and I reckon any fast balls that go for the corners from a close enough range would go in (tho tbf, most of the gks in Shooting Stars likely couldn't save those either). She needs more time to train to be an A+ gk. That's why, as long as the offense is more or less equal b/w the 2 teams, my money's on Kisum winning that gk battle unless she's having a terrible day or something. If WW's only offense were mid-range shots akin to what Moon Tak did for BD this game w/o Kyungseo, then Juyeon has a good enough read to block those, but so far WW seems to mostly rely on Gayoung quickly pushing through and with the addition of bulldozer Seolhee, it might be too fast and hectic for Juyeon and end up leading to a few goals.",

She's got good sense but is slow in her movement and not her reactions/reflex.\n\nAlso KKangMi needs to work on her soft touch and individual skills.  Looks like her can boot balls out of bounds and chase attacking runs but i didnt see much in terms of her kicking good outlet passes or forward passes.\n\nWith a month of training since the last game i hope SF players all skilled up a bit because WW will be a tough match up.\n\nBoth teams have great tenacity and mental fortitude.   Great toughness during battles.  But both teams lack the soft finesse skills that make us go wow.",

Since these are mostly celebrities/celeb-adjacent, finding one who has soccer experience but not too much is a tough balancing act.

You can tell that Na Mi Hae has more finesse on her striking and looks like she found her *golden zone* on right flank. Ofc their potential ace, Kim Min Ji has shown some improvement from rough up plays from her debut.

But I am bitter from last season, so I am rooting for Streaming. :)\n\nAs for Gukdae, if (and it is a big IF) they are able to stay intact, they will be a scary team for next season. MiHae will grow into a more scarier option for them rather than MinJi. Her ball handling skills and shooting were just amazing for a newbie. SeoHyun is a better keeper than EunJi , because she throws were just exceptional, and so was her positioning. It might be because they were up against a wounded Balladream, but she did saved her team.\n\nBalladream, oh my Balladream. How the mighty have fallen. Two missed penalties, when you went into battle without your best player, are a sign that they need to rethink their whole strategy and formation going forward. They may have the time, since chances are they will be taking some time off for next season. It hurts just to say that.",

I miss their OT5 line-up... :P \n\nThat said, a highlight of the show was the NatFam GK. She's tall, quick on her feet and massively improved her positioning so all her saves looked clean and very natural. Definitely one of the best goalies on the show now. That's talent right there, reminds me alof of early Irene. \n\nA lowlight though is MoonTak's defending. I don't think it's malicious and she's a bit clumsy/not as agile, but someone must have coached her doing those nasty defensive moves where she steps in way too late and bodychecks her opponents... This for me is just over the limit (with Actionistas Hye Jung being annoying but on the limit) for what's good for the show. Because if those moves were intentional, it opens up a whole can of worms if she injured the still active national athlete or an active idol or something...",

I think this upcoming game is about not making silly errors that can affect the game.Streaming has to come into the game with a mentality of \"playing their game\" and \"not worried about getting into Super League\". That way the can play more relax and stable. Whereas Wonder will be playing to get into Super League because they are the only team that has not experience that.

            "comment": "1. My main thought is I really don't like the show having a suspension. For Anaconda it came at exactly the wrong time, just as they were showing real improvement and got their first win. Now with the high possibility it could be BD next, that would be awful. To lose BD, specifically Kyoung Seo and Seogi, from both the leagues and show would be straight garbage. \n2. This was a sad match with Kyoung Seo out so hurt. How did she completely tear two tendons and not need surgery? Is she gonna live and play on the one remaining tendon? Jeez. \n3. BD didn't have much of a chance with mainly just Seogi on offense. She's got skills for sure but she's not an ace who can break through on her own. She needs to either be setup or be the one setting up her ace. \n4. Some have been dying for Minseo out of the goalie box and onto the field but this to me showed how value she is as BD's goalie. Obviously with Kyoung Seo hurt she needed to be on offense but while she did some nice stuff, but her individual skills with the ball weren't \"she must play on the field!!!' or anything. If BD all of a sudden had a solid goalie join the team then sure, Minseo has an exciting ceiling and after some months things would look different but they don't, they have Lisa as their other option at goalie. Minseo at goalie saves way more goals and is part of the teams build up and set pieces compared to Lisa who loses more goals and isn't a meaningful part of the build up or set pieces. Besides, if Kyoung Seo and Seogi are healthy on offense, Minseo on the field wouldn't provide enough impact to be worth having just Tak on a defensive island and Lisa at goalie. \n5. Speaking of Minseo, she burnt herself out in the first half and became barely effective in the second half. Easily falling over, running without energy and unable to put much power or accuracy into her passes and shots. A bummer. I think a good coach recognizes that Minseo is likely going to feel very burdened filling in for Kyoung Seo and when he sees her early in the first half going all out, he tells her to calm down and not burn through all her energy. That way come the second half, she is much less burnt out and therefore is still an effective player. \n6. Seo Hyun is a really damn good goalie. It's really pretty amazing, especially with how little experience she has. It's a bummer they had to take from their offense, with her being quite good and was the league scoring leader when they were in the Super League, but their offense as-is isn't anything to sneeze at. Especially as Minji gets better over time.",

            "comment": "I would love to see a slight tweak to the elimination format.  A team should get a 1 year grace period...maybe 2.  I think it's pretty absurd that a team with only 3 months training has to compete against teams like the national family team that has had like 3-4 years worth of time to be coached and get better.  So, if a new team finishes last in their first year...there is simply no elimination that year. Otherwise it will more and more just become a rotation of the bottom team, unless they put together an all star team as the new team.  This would still allow for there to be some change of teams, but not quite as much of a disadvantage to new teams. Obviously I haven't seen whether the streamer team loses or not as that is next week, but the idea of there ALWAYS having to be an elimination every year seems ridiculous.  They will run out of women willing to play soccer eventually if they just keep trying to make a new team every year. Plus, it seems competitively unfair, which is my bigger complaint.  Actionista has had mostly the same core but added a former athlete to replace a leaving member...that is hardly the same capabilities as some players who have never played soccer getting a 3 month crash course. I actually think the streamer team could be really really good, if they were given more time to develop, soccer skill wise.  Like...anaconda kind of deserved to be eliminated, but some of these other teams, they are basically as good as any of the other teams, so who gets removed from the league comes down to sheer luck, I juries being a big part of it.",

                            "comment": "Yeah I mentioned that in my post.  I don't know the results of their match yet.  But I think they got pretty lucky with that group.  I'm saying in theory, they can't constantly rely on new players magically picking up the sport quickly.  Like I actually think SF could be one of the best teams in the league with enough time and coaching. The only reason they are close to the bottom 4 teams right now is inexperience.  Other rookie teams will most likely be more like the Anacondas, who had one good player, and the rest simply couldn't compete. And that was after a couple of seasons. It hasn't been an issue yet, but I would be willing to bet some money it will before long.",

The half time breaks are probably long because they are not pro players and the PDs need to check or charge equipments etc in that time (at least 30~40 mins). Euddeum's saying the whole shoot could take 2 hours and that's not wrong but they definitely don't play constantly during that time.",

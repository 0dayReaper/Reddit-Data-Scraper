    "postText": "First off, I only consume Korean programming so my feedback will only reflect that. Feel free to ask any questions if I missed anything in my post. I have annual subscriptions to these three services and will only keep one after the expiration of the other two. All prices are USD\n\nViki: \nCost-$99.99\n\nPros-Has more than just Korean programming. Appear to have all the latest shows from the big K Networks. Good translations for the most part. Has the option of watching with timed fan comments (but something I don\u2019t select). App has been fairly reliable on iPad, Roku and Amazon fire. Appears to have most of the popular and older movies. Also have some new releases available to rent anywhere from $3.99-5.99\n\nCons-Weekly releases of on-air shows are available later than the other two. For me, it\u2019s been on avg of 4+ hours. Likely due to translation time but sometimes it has taken longer and uploaded without translation. Does not have more than 50ish most recent episodes of popular shows like running man, 2D1N, I Live alone, etc. Inability to setup different profiles for family members. You see what they watch and where they left off.\n\nOnDemandKorea:\nCost-$109.99 (but it\u2019s lower for newer subscribers)\n\nPros-Faster releases of the new on-air episodes. Has limited lineup of live tv channels. Has similar movies as Viki but also has soft porn movies. \n\nCons-Translations unavailable for many popular variety shows. Least reliable and  versatile app. App on my Roku is the best, but bad on Amazon. Doesn\u2019t allow me to login my premium subscription info anywhere so I\u2019m unable to utilize. Inability to setup different profiles like Viki. Similar to Viki, only has 50ish episodes of the on air shows.\n\nKocowa+:\nCost-$79.99\n\nPros-can setup up to four profiles for friends and family. Has the best app user interface on iPads and my Roku compared to the other two. Has hundreds of episodes of the top variety shows like running man, 2D1N etc. The category dashboard seems easier to navigate and find content compared to the other two. Everything seems to have an English translation with sometimes having Spanish and Portuguese in some cases. Has some older shows that I wanted to rewatch (Michuri village 8)\n\nCons-no app for Amazon fire. Redirects to Amazon prime Kocowa content. No live tv channel lineup. The search function is not available via a shortcut. If you scroll down to view the category dashboards and can\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for, you have to scroll all the way back up to search. \nNote- I have yet to watch movies on this platform.\n\nVerdict: Kocowa+ is the best value for me overall. Having the larger show libraries, most aesthetically pleasing UI AND lowest price does it for me. Between this and Netflix, I got my kcontent fix covered\n\nHope this was remotely helpful to anyone looking to subscribe.",

            "comment": "The subscription to OnDemandKorea Premium includes login in Kocowa via OnDemandKorea authentication.  OnDemandKorea has more variety shows than Kocowa, but majority of them don't have subtitles. I think OnDemandKorea is more geared to Korean native speakers, and shares many of the programs on Kocowa without English subtitles.  The limited number of episodes seems to be related to if Kocowa carries the show or not.  For example the Animal Farm variety show has well over 100 episodes, and I stopped looking for more because I didn't want to wait for the page to load more episodes on my computer.  This isn't available on Kocowa.   I prefer to watch dramas on Kocowa than Viki, because I am not a fan subtitles on Viki (especially with the self promotion of the team doing the subtitles). Using OnDemandKorea I liked to watch Korean news and variety shows that aren't available on Kocowa.  I am learning how to speak Korean, so watching it helps with immersion with the language when I watch them on OnDemandKorea.   For reference I subscribe to all 3 services.",

The other options are buggy and less convenient. \n\nAmazon Prime also seems to be getting more into the k-drama game. And Hulu seems to be getting started too (with some dramas &amp; variety that have aired on Disney+ Korea). \n\n\n(OG kdrama streamers remember: RIP DramaFever...you are still missed).",

Timed comments used to be good and funny, nowadays it's full of people demanding subtitles, criticizing main leads 5 minutes into the 1st ep (lol) and being annoying in general (\"don't you think this person looks like *insert-kpop-idol-name-here*\" or they'd see a word and making reference to kpop songs \ud83d\ude44)\n\nUsed to have ODK too, abandoned it because my Korean is not good enough to understand an entire episode without subtitles and most of the hard-to-find shows there don't have English subtitles.\n\nNever tried Kocowa+. But I have Viki pass plus and was under the impression it comes with Kocowa shows too, but oh well. I got Youtube Premium, Netflix, and Amazon Prime on top of Viki pass plus, I think I can do without Kocowa+ lol but then again, I watch all sorts of shows (not strictly Korean though mostly Korean lol)",

Viki only has about 50 of the most recent episodes. Seems like this was a recent change at Viki. I had to change my subscription to Viki pass and get Kocowa+ because I enjoy watching older episodes of variety shows when I'm bored or just looking for a laugh.",

Transcriptions are okay. Content does not change as frequently as Viki. Has some of the older kdramas.\n\nHulu+ - limited kdrama content but it is improving. Has some of the standard Viki content. Transcriptions are okay.\n\nNetflix - my second favorite source for Asian drama content. Has content Viki and others do not have. Has some of my favorite jdrama and cdrama content. Transcriptions are 2nd to Viki. Lots of content but not as much as Viki.\n\nDisney+ - limited kdrama content but cannot be found elsewhere. I believe it will be adding more content over the next few years. Has content other sites do not have. \n\nFree streaming - all B to C level content\n- Asian Crush\n- Tubi\n- Roku",

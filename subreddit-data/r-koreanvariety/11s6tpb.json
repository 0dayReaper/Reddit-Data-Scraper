That is not what this show is about on any level. \n\nI think the team was developing really nicely under their new manager (who is now Fire Moth's manager) and with Yoonju looking like a superstar in the All Star match and Taejin playing like Taejin. Haley is solid and still developing too. Sieun I don't ever being impressed by or noticing development but she's young and so it's possible if during this suspension she is working on her skills, Da Yeong is sorta the same (not memorable) and Jungyeon, obviously it could help if she retired for her own reasons and they used the opportunity to add a new player with experience. But how many TV show hosts/presenters have soccer experience? Especially if they really only have talent from SBS to chose from and not the entire industry. \n\nI think they were on the right track, developmentally as a team, but the suspension likely nuked that. Even if they don't lose any members so team unity and synergy is intact, it's HIGHLY unlikely on their own time, with their own money, they have been both training individually and as a team in order to continue their development so coming out of suspension they are better than when they went in. \n\nI agree that the team, in order to survive, let alone thrive, needs an upgrade or two talent-wise but I hope that isn't done by cutting any members. If the show crosses that line it can't really come back when future members of teams are awful. Fans will call for their firings and for \"better\" places to get their spots. This isn't Gentlemen's League, it is a show about women developing soccer skills.",

But since the cat's out of the bag, the members I hope to be replaced are Sieun and Jungyeon.\n\nAnd for your point of getting rid of players, well......that's just how it is in sports. No matter what, personnel changes are bound to happen in any competitive sport. At this point, I think this is more than just a variety show especially to the cast/players. For me, I think Sieun and Jungyeon had the least amount of development and hampered the team's progress. But I will give credit where it is due, they fight every single game and nobody can take that away from them.\n\nI'm not saying to replace those two with experienced or overpowered members, I'm just saying that changes are inevitable so that Anaconda may find better success. The show's very charm is seeing these people, who may or may not have prior experience with the sport, start off their football journey, improve through training, and compete at their highest level. Going back to my point, I didn't see those with the two I mentioned earlier.",

The show isn't about the destination (Championship, elite teams filled with the best players available) but instead it's about the journey. It's about these women, almost all of which started off as newbies to soccer, learning how to play and developing into competent amateur teams. \n\nI don't disagree that, from what I remember, Sieun was surprisingly subpar and never really showed much development. Jungyeon was basically the same but much older which meant even less athleticism. But unless they leave of their own will, I think it tarnishes the heart and concept of the show for producers to step in and force them out in order to \"upgrade\" the talent on the team. \n\nChanges are \"inevitable\" doesn't quite describe what you are wanting. You are wanting the producers to fire two members because they aren't good enough players. If that happened and it got out that happened I think the show could experience a decent backlash, especially from female viewers who see themselves in the players who are older or trying their best but aren't good. The show would get labeled \"they care about the play on the field, not the players and their development\" and rightfully so. \n\nTo be clear, I would be very happy if say Jungyeon, Sieun or both bowed out organically. It would provide a great opportunity for the producers to add talent and upgrade Anaconda. But firing people? That ain't it. Sports or not sports, that's not this show. \n\nLastly, I really think you might be underestimating how small the pool is that Anaconda's team concept has to draw from, talent wise. We are talking about news reporters, radio hosts and show hosts (aka \"announcers\"). Not just that, but probably limited to SBS announcers. The amount of athletic female announcers out there is likely limited. The amount who would go on the show reduces that number by probably a ton. Now if you're wanting someone with some futsal/soccer experience? Who knows if there is even one. Anaconda is NOT like the other teams concepts where they have much larger pools of people to try to recruit. It's entirely possible that literally the best two female announcer soccer players in SK are Taejin and Yoonju.",

No matter what, personnel changes are bound to happen in any competitive sport. At this point, I think this is more than just a variety show especially to the cast/players.

No worries, I think this topic is debatable. \ud83d\ude01\n\nAt least for me, the lack of improvement of Sieun and Jungyeon, and I think this is even too much to say since this is a variety show, is a bit discrediting to the team and to the show.\n\nThey've been on the show longer than some and there is, or lack of, progress at all. Like we've both mentioned, and especially to the cast members, this is more than just a show to them. Everyone worked so hard to be better. A prime example is Yoonju \u2014 goalkeeper turned striker who joined later than the two; Dayoung \u2014 as we've seen from the latest ep, nobody could've predicted she had that in her, and considering she's an idol who's probably already busy in that aspect; heck, even both Lee Young Ji and Kim Byung Ji's wife \u2014 who I think(not sure) are older, have made significant strides and improvements and play vital roles on their teams.\n\nSo that's basically my point. To be honest, I love every cast member and it has been fun to see their journey, but as a viewer and probably from their point as competitors, changes might alter the game's dynamic, make it more competitive, and for Anaconda to allow them to find success.\n\nBut hey, we're just two people typing on the front of our computers and phones, so we can't really say.",

But the part about a lack of progress, for the sake of the show and their teams dynamic in order to be more competitive, they should hit the road. That's not a fact, that is a take and I'm saying it goes against the spirit of the show and would be met with backlash. \n\nAlso, you're quite literally wrong. I myself predicted on this sub back when Dayoung first started playing that she is a natural athlete and a natural soccer player and that she will develop quickly.\n\nLastly, I wouldn't compare stars to the lower tier of players. There are always going to be a lower tier of players. I don't think you realize how many teams have a Sieun level player on them.\n\nBut this convo has run its course.",

She looks heavy when running, but so far her fitness was adequate. TG ball controls are still there and upgraded a bit. DaYoung showed potential with her postioning, ball control, speed and aggressiveness. Still lacking on \"touch\" but I think she will get it once the season is fully up and running.\n\nFM is still a complete and eager team. Physicality and speed are their forte. I am sure they will start developing their positioning and ball skills soon. SoAh is just an instinct striker with her header. Pure marvelous. GaRyeong has a potential to be a solid defender.\n\nOverall, it was a close and exciting game where TG capabilities are put out for everbody to see. This will be another tough group to predict now. But if they, TG and FM continue this level of play, AC will not move on to the semi this season.\n\nBut more importantly, the first RED card for the next game! Excited to see that. Looks like sloppy and dangerous defense/play are no longer tolerated in this show.",

They don't have time to 'get it' because their season will end if they don't perform well enough in the first 2 matches to progress to the knock-out stage of SL. You need to secure the 1st two games for you to get the your season up and running.\n\nThis is why I think a lot of SL teams (especially those with new members) falter. Not enough game time to kick into gear and for new players to gain experience. I still remember Young Pyo refusing to let Chicky play on Action in their prime because the stakes were too high.",

She's adorable.\n* Speaking of money, I will say, some people really watch the viewership stats and wonder about 'Shooting Stars' staying on the air or not but SBS keeps investing in this show. The stadium, the LED's, the banners, all the locker rooms with their full team decorations, the pre-game press conference set, and even adding a new team (unless Anaconda don't get any pay while suspended). Doesn't seem like the type of thing a network would be doing for a show that's on the bubble. Rather it seems like it's the prized crown jewel show of the network by how they are investing in it.\n* It would be awesome if Ayumi could upgrade her skills as a goalie due to her team now having a good former pro goalie as their manager. Besides that, I really hope Byungji does FC Top Girl right and they develop well. Not just individual skills but team play. I don't think he's been particularly good at that iirc. I really hope the weakest link of the team isn't the manager.\n* On the flip side, I expect Jae-jin to help Fire Moth. I think he did a good job with NatFam iirc and he really did a good job with Anaconda, even though they got suspended.\n* Next season has an \"FA Cup\" which has all teams competing in it, including Anaconda. It's unclear from this if that means all of next season will be FA Cup matches or if we will get a mixture of Super League matches, Challenge League matches and FA Cup matches throughout the season. *\"All teams of the Super-Challenge League should remember that the results of this season will effect the following season\"* is then said, per the ENG subs. Why that needs to be said when that has been the case every season since there have been two leagues, I don't know.\n* As a huge Ana fan it doesn't really mean anything considering we already knew they were suspended and coming back next season. The new info is weirder, that they might be returning for the FA Cup but not the Super-Challenge League? Assuming they all happen at the same time. That doesn't really make sense, you'd think a team is demoted at the end of this SL-CL season, Anaconda is brought out of suspension and then next season they, Anaconda, would be playing on both. But why then was it mentioned as \"we MIGHT see Anaconda then?\" Weird.\n* Soyeon is playing and Yea Won is on the bench, I really hope at some point the show gives us a scene or two of them interacting as friends (both from Singles Inferno).",

All of these probably help SBS's decision to fully support the growth of the show. They did the promotion for World Cup, but imagine how huge its going to be to actually promoting Women World Cup.

The first is by having them play the FA Cup during the break between seasons which I don't particularly like and the second is for every team to be playing two games a week. One match is a Challenge/Super League match and the other game is a FA Cup match. While that increases their work load, it's hard to think a 20 minute game of futsal twice a week is a bad thing. It's not like they are playing 40-90 minutes a match. It's 20 minutes of cardio. If this was a physical contact sport like wrestling, rugby or American football then that would be a massively different thing but these ladies do 20 minutes of heavy cardio likely 3x or more a week anyways. One more 20 minute match a week should be easy. \n\nThose are some good points. I had definitely heard through the show that interest in womens futsal/soccer had shown real upticks with a lot of futsal teams being formed with regular Korean women.",

If your sub #2 with no previous soccer experience then you're only seeing the field if there are injuries or if multiple people leave the team. On the flip side, if your subs are slowly developing and then player(s) leave your team, you don't have to go out and find complete noobs (which is fine!) to join the team. Instead the subs who are developed noobs slide into those empty spots. That'd be good. \n\nI just don't know how much sub #2 on teams would get rotated in, even with 2 games a week, if she is a noob. Unless one of your players is totally gassed, you'd rather have a tired experience player out there than a noobie who makes a bunch of first-timer mistakes that cost you goals.",

It's still just 20 minutes of cardio + cameras following them in the locker-room and as they sit and watch the other teams match before or after their match. Mentally taxing? Sure, but physically they aren't doing anything beyond walking or sitting. Now if the new Cup matches meant back to back matches (two matches a day for every team) then I would totally be singing a different tune. Not only would 2 subs be a must but I'd be disagreeing with the decision to have two matches in a day.

Whether it's a game of futsal, basketball or anything non-contact, a 20 minute game is doable on the weekend for even relatively unfit people. \n\nAgain, you mention main job, main job, main job. But the thing is, most of these people are entertainers and their main jobs are being in variety contents or shooting some other content (like radio host a few times a week). It's not like we are talking about 40+ hour nurses, teachers and chefs or something. \n\nEven parenting, if you thought of it as needing to be one of their weekend days entirely for shooting a show then sure, that would be too much for mothers and possibly wives. But this show shoots during the week. It is \"work\" for them. Just like their other jobs, which might be 8-7 or 9-5 or abnormal hours, this would be one day a week in which they shoot \\~10 hours. I fail to see how that is outrageous and therefore it needs to happen just once a month.",

Doing 20 minute of futsal is doable as you say, but does training takes time? They need to train and recover too.  Is the fitness level adequate for them to play 2 games a week? Can they recover timely to play another game in a week or same week? Some teams average age are a bit higher than some. In season 1 they used to play like every 3 days and then we all know what happened with the injuries. And doing the schedule for 60 ladies + 10 coaches + others is quite a job.",

It seems like, per the YouTuber who covers this show, they will shoot the FA Cup matches and then after that is over, go back to the Leagues matches. So they won't need to increase matches per month. \n\nI think 2 matches per week would push it for the reasons you stated but I think 2 matches per month would be easily doable. Again we aren't talking about 40-90 minute matches that take a few days for normies to recover from. Almost all of these women have said they already train multiple times a week. One former member, So Yoon of Wonder Woman, recently [saying she left the show because they trained for 4-5 hours everyday](https://youtu.be/zi7-4XuCokI?t=1382).  Now obviously that is on the extreme side but again, most players (including the older ones) have said or shown on IG that they train multiple days a week for likely 1-2 hours each session. \n\nSo do I think adding a second match in a month of 20 minutes is gonna have much negative effect on the players? No. I just don't. In a week? Sure, that'd push it. But a month? These women are training for soccer and going to the gym to run on treadmills for 30+ minutes and doing weights/Pilates and such. 20 minutes of cardio and kicking a ball isn't an NFL game.",

It's not that she's an amazing player, yet, but from her first game I said she was a natural and a damn good athlete and so she would develop very quickly. Here we are not much later and she is not just starting, not just running around all game but she is showing skills and soccer IQ. At 33:15 you see Rina pass to Yubin and seeing that Dayoung instantly starts back peddling deep towards the half field mark, up against the sideline. Perfect positioning to get open for the next pass. She gets the pass, dribbles up and passes which leads to Bo-kyung shooting an on target shot at the goal. Imagine Dayoung a year from now... ace level ceiling.\n* My next prediction has already been expect fast development and an ace level ceiling from Soyeon. I think she will be less nimble than Dayoung who has light, agile dancers feet but Soyeon will make up in other ways; her physique, strength and kicking power.\n* It was cool to see Ayumi, within the first few plays, display her development from her instruction to defend the goal by coming out rather than being passive all the time.\n* I like the new stats with ball possession time and passes.\n* Where is Irene? Not seen on the bench with her teammates all match.\n* If only Dayoung was in a bit better position when Bokyung came charging down and shot the ball at the goal (after it was 0-1). She coulda just tapped it in.\n* On that BoKyung shot with less than a minute left, yet again the other striker (Dayoung) is about 8 feet (2.5 meters) from the goal post when I'd love to see her right next to it. The ball misses the left goal post by inches and if Dayoung was there she could just redirect it in with a tap. Balls miss within inches of the goal post too often on this show to not have the striker waiting there instead of being 6-8 feet away.\n\nPost game: \n\n* That game was rough. Not because it wasn't really good, but I really like both teams and just like Kyoung Seo last week for Balladream, BoKyung had bad luck as her teams ace. Fire Moth's goalie was good, their defense was strong and the ball just never bounced her way and found its way into the goal.\n* I love Top Girls mentality. I have for a while, and both during this game (after the lost goal) and after the loss they are so positive and healthy with their mentality. You love to see it. Especially when they coulda been upset breaking their win streak and losing their first game after the Championship win. I wonder if that pressure weighed on them and with it removed they will play more freely.\n* I'm not worried about Top Girl or any curse. They are too good with strong team continuity of players and continued development of skills and soccer IQ to be worried about them losing a bunch and falling to the CL. For their sake they need to hope some of the other teams are less strong on defense and that Dayoung continues to develop quickly so less offensive responsibility is on BoKyung's shoulders. - BoKyung can't always be Kyoung Seo and charge down the field like a one person offense. BoKyung needs to sometimes be like Seogi, given the defensive attention BoKyung gets, and pass it to her Kyoung Seo, Dayoung, who can reliably kick passed balls and shoot on target. In order for that to happen though, Dayoung needs to develop more.\n* Both Dayoung and So Yeon are gonna be even more scary when their feet sync up to the ball when it's moving. Both have trouble connecting with a moving ball but those that sync their foot up to it can do damage.\n* Teaser for next week: Yoni P left the show. The new player looks REALLY tall. Interesting. Kisum to goalie. I believe I've read that she's said she played goalie in the past and was hoping for that position when she joined the team so here's hoping it's an upgrade for her and the team.",

The team played well but it looked like GaRyeong's tough defense got to her mentally and she was forcing too many plays.  Hats off to GaRyeong's pitbull attitude and constant learning.\n\nFireMoths will be a force to reckon with.  They showcased their versatility.  Looks like PSY, SoYeon, and GaRyeong can play defense and offense.  Making their opposition confused by their interchangeable nature.",

Really could've gone both ways. \n\n&gt;!TG is still my favourite team so of course I'm just a bit sad, but they really poured it their all and I don't think there is much to regret in the way they played. I'm still so amazed by their progress, knowing where they started from.!&lt;Dayoung's improved a lot, and I'm excited about the progress to come because she can become a really solid player once the details are polished up. Shoutout to Rina who's personally my favourite captain, amazing sportsmanship, makes the entire team such a supportive and encouraging space to be and grow in. &gt;!Her at the end going, ''Even when we lose, let's lose wonderfully'' made my heart so warm. (Also shoutout to Yubin and another goal added to her roaster haha, said all in good heart of course, I hope she won't blame herself too much for it but she has a solid 'mental' so she should be fine. Love her and loved seeing her encouraging Bokyung during the game.)!&lt;Really liked seeing the coach give tips to improve Ayumi's already stellar goal-keeping, I did feel like some places to be improved on were starting to show and seeing her given the chance to improve &gt;!(and see it play out in the game!) !&lt;was very satisfying. Also hope Minzy gets the space and opportunity to improve! \n\nFM brought it all they got and I didn't expect anything less of them, mvp for me goes to Ahn Hye Kyoung, insane blockings! And of course Park Ga Ryong's persistence through the whole match despite the pain is to be commended, I hope her thigh will be okay from now on despite it all. For sure a team to be feared in the Super League, as the others teams also noticed &gt;!(Lee Youngjin going ''why did we have to be in group A?'' made me giggle, haha). !&lt;\n\nAll in all great game, great teams, loved it.",

It was a great defense effort for **Park Ga Ryong**, no easy feat; she\u2019s known for her great stamina and running on 2 ends of pitch but in that game she was visibly tired on following Kim Bo Kyung. Another option to put against KBK is Kang So Yeon due to her physique but we\u2019re talking about the rough end + putting someone on defender pocket which is fit on Park Ga Ryong since she\u2019s not can easily push out.

I'm glad at least the top girl are all have positive reaction after the loss. \n\nwith ayumi that always great and ahn hyekyung that crazy good yesterday. im curious with the actionista GK, hopefully she have mad improvement from that scrimmage game.",

I actually hope they stop the current format and start the actual league format where all the 6 teams in super league play each other rather than twice in the current format.\n\nThey should also stop penalty shootout and introduce draw in the new league format.",

But in this format, every game is important. For the PK, i guess it brings in ratings/viewership that's why they keep it. After all this is a variety show.",

Any mistake or \"off game\" are not a luxury they can afford. Every game is very important and every players have to \"on their games\".\n\nOtherwise, it will be like Challenge League's round robin where teams can play with the odds and losses are manageable. Look at how WW manage to survive last season, even though they were the worst performing team overall. (Sorry I am still not over Ana being suspended)\n\nIts a do or die league: Super League.",

            "comment": "SL has grown to a place that eats up rookies and bench players. Not even practice and time to get to the level of play. Dayoung showed great growth within the game alone but it was clearly not enough as she made lots of errors. A lot of good passes were wasted on her and she seems to still not understand positioning in the mid field. Her facilities are there tho so I hope to see her grow even more, they really need to pound more basics into her. \n\nSooAh also needs to pick up some basics but she has a natural talent on positioning. I think that\u2019s her experience in playing tennis. GaRyeoung also showed growth as a defender in the game. But still she made a lot of mistakes that were luckily not capitalized. Her defense would not work on fast breaks or counter attacks. &gt;! If TG had switched to a WC or OW fast pace offense I think they could have won. !&lt; I think this game was the result of coaching. The adjustments made in halftime made the difference.\n\nI\u2019m excited for the FA. Yoon Taejin has been may fav since the start I would like to see AC back under a new system.\n\nNext game is going to be interesting, idk how OW are going to win if they lost their GK. She literally was the reason they stayed in the league with her cat like reflexes. She was underrated as a Keep for sure. NF is a wildcard for me they are basically a new team.",

DY is also missing soooooo many chances, so frustrating. She has good stamina but hasn't fully compensated for Kandalf's finishing ability yet.\n\nOmg the champ's curse persists \ud83d\ude2c what an intense game tho\n\nGR was the MVP this game, along with their GK. Finding out GR had cramps and seeing her endure it was so heartbreaking.\n\nYooooo looks like Nat Fam recruited another ringer! Kisum in the GK position is an interesting choice. Excited to see the newbies!",

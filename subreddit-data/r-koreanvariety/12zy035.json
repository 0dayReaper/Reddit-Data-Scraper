READ THE BELOW SPOILERS unless you really want to be spoiled of the game highlights.**\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~1' BD Miss: **(BD 27- GK)** quickly tosses the ball back in play deep to **(BD 7)** who traps it and dekes out **(WW 31)** and takes a shot on net with pressure on her which is off target and smothered easily by **(WW 10- GK)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~1' BD Miss: **(BD 7)** takes a quick sideline kick-in with a high cross towards **(BD 10)** but **(WW 10- GK)** comes off her goal line to block the pass, BD is using a quick sideline kick-in strategy to keep WW off guard and not let them set up their defenses!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' BD Miss: **(BD 7)** takes a quick sideline kick-in with a high cross towards **(BD 10)** but **(BD 10)** misses the heading attempt by a few inches and the ball goes out of bounds to the opposite sideline!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~2' BD Miss: **(BD 7)** takes a quick sideline kick-in with a low speedy cross towards **(BD 10)** but **(BD 10)** misses the heading attempt ball is struck too hard and low!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' BD Miss: **(BD 10)** takes a sideline kick-in with a high cross towards the goal mouth that **(BD 10)** and **(WW 10- GK)** get to and collide, **(WW 10- GK)** punches the ball forward and calls for some time but the play continues as she holds her side and the ball goes out of bounds to the sidelines!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' BD Miss: **(BD 10)** takes a sideline kick-in with a mid height cross towards the goal mouth that **(WW 02)** blocks and re-directs out of bounds for a corner kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~3' BD Miss: **Coach DaeSe** calls for play \"Sechs\" or 6, all BD players are deep by the centerline and run together towards the net **(BD 10)** takes the corner kick-in with a low bouncing cross towards the top of the 16 yard box for **(BD 7)** to take a shot, the shot is poorly executed and **(WW 02)** controls it and breaks out down the right wing only to collide with **(BD 3)** both players go down, a free kick is awarded to WW!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~4' WW Miss: **(WW 02)** takes a free kick with a shot on target that is high, **(WW 31)** misses the heading attempt and **(BD 27- GK)** blocks the ball and it re-directs forward, eventually ending up as a corner kick for BD!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~4' BD Miss: **(BD 10)** takes corner kick with a power low pass to **(BD 7)** who one-time re-directs the ball on target but most of the pass was absorbed by her foot and not much speed was on the shot, **(WW 10- GK)** ends up smothering the ball!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~5' BD Miss: **(BD 7)** steals the ball from **(WW 02)** deep in WW territory and takes a shot on target to the near low right post area that **(WW 10- GK)** saves with her left foot and re-directs out of bounds for a corner kick, a glorious chance missed by **(BD 7)**, great reflex reaction save by **(WW 10- GK)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~5' BD Miss: **(BD 10)** takes the corner kick with a mid height cross that is punched out by **(WW 10-)** who came off her goal line, the punched out ball is set up for a shot to **(BD 3)** who shoots on net and it is blocked by **(WW 02)** who closes the gap and blocks the ball with her thigh, the ball goes out of bounds to the left wing sideline!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' WW Foul: **(WW 02)** gets a hand ball foul from a clearing shot by **(BD 3)** as WW was breaking down for an offensive chance, WW having a hard time getting their own offense going!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' WW SUB: **(WW 29)** is subbed off for **(WW 8)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~6' WW Miss: **(WW 02)** dribbles the ball forward with some speed, she goes down the left wing and cuts back towards the middle of the field, she takes a shot on net but **(BD 3)** blocks it [looks like it hit her left arm/hand but no foul called], the deflection of the ball goes to the right wing and **(WW 8))** gets a one-time shot on net that is aimed to the near side right post and misses by a foot, replay kinda shows that the ball hit more of **(BD 3)**'s left thigh more than her arm!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' BD Miss: **(BD 27-GK)** tosses the ball back into play quickly with a high lob to the center circle, which bounces in front of **(WW 31)** who botches the first touch and it bounces to **(BD 24)** who also botches her first touch, but the ball bounces to **(BD 7)** who controls it with a kick forward with her left foot and she chases the ball down and shoots on target with a power shot that **(WW 10- GK)** blocks with her right knee and she smothers the rebound!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' WW Miss: **(WW 23)** takes a sideline kick-in with a deep shot on target that hits **(BD 10)**'s legs and re-directs to the front of BD goal mouth, **(BD 3)** is there to clear the ball forward away from **(WW 8)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!7' BD GOAL: **(BD 7)** takes a quick sideline kick-in with a shot towards the WW net, **(WW 02)** manages to block the shot [might have been a handball foul], the ball bounces downwards that **(BD 10)** corrals to her feet, turns around and takes a low far side shot to the bottom right corner for a great goal, looks like the quick play from the sidelines caught the WW defense a bit flat-footed and out of position as both **(WW 02)** and **(WW 23)** got in each other's way for **(BD 10)** to have a clear shot!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~7' WW SUB: **(WW 8)** is subbed off for **(WW 29)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~8' WW Miss: a bit of loose ball action eventually leading to **(WW 02)** gaining possession of the ball, with **(WW 29)** seeing that WW have the ball she breaks to her right wing as **(WW 02)** moves the ball forward and is being collapsed up on by **(BD 3)** and **(BD 24)**, **(WW 02)** kicks a beauty outlet pass to the right wing for **(WW 29)** who takes a one-time shot on target that is blocked by **(BD 27- GK)** who comes off her goal line to block the ball with her knees, the ball goes out of bounds to the sidelines!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' WW Miss: **(WW 10- GK)** kicks the ball in play deep into BD territory, the ball bounces and **(BD 3)** gets a weak header that drops to **(WW 02)**'s feet, **(WW 02)** manages to get a weak shot on target that **(BD 27- GK)** smothers easily!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~9' BD Foul: **(BD 27- GK)** throws the ball deep into WW territory with a high lobbing ball that **(WW 31)** heads right back into BD territory, with a brain fart **(BD 3)** sticks out her arm and a hand ball foul is called, a direct free-kick is awarded to WW between the top of the 16 yard box and the center circle, a great spot!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~10' WW Miss: **(WW 02)** takes the direct free kick with a shot on net that goes over the BD three woman wall and sails over the crossbar by a foot, the whistle blows to end the first half!&lt;\n\nHALFTIME SCORE LINE: &gt;!------- WW 0 - 1 BD------------, WW having a hard time generating offense but BD seems to be getting exhausted from their quick kick-ins, perhaps the coaches should start using their subs to manage their team's energy levels!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' WW Miss: **(WW 02)** takes a sideline kick-in with a back pass to **(WW 23)**, who passes it right back to **(WW 02)** who cuts to the middle of the field and dribbles towards the BD net kicking a low roller to the right post that **(WW 29)** whiffs on a shot attempt, the ball goes out of bounds missing the target by a foot, a glorious re-direction chance missed!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~11' WW Miss: **(WW 31)** takes a sideline kick-in with a deep cross intended for **(WW 8)**'s head, no connection made on the header, the cross was great the heading attempt was there, just a missed glorious chance!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~12' BD Miss: **(BD 10)** takes a sideline kick-in with a deep cross that is blocked by a header from **(WW 31)** the ball goes straight up and **(WW 10- GK)** tracks it down and catches the ball before any real threat is developed!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~13' BD Foul: **(BD 3)** clears the ball but **(BD 10)**'s hand blocks the clearing attempt, a direct free kick is awarded to WW close to the center circle, **(WW 8)** is subbed off for **(WW 29)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' WW Miss: **(WW 02)** takes direct free kick with a shot on target that hits the top of the cross bar near the top right corner of the net, **(WW 31)** was there to attempt a header but the ball was too high!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~14' BD Miss: **(BD 7)** steals the ball from **(WW 02)** from near the centre circle and dribbles forward getting stopped by **(WW 31)** but with momentum the ball continues foward and **(BD 7)** manages a shot on target to the far left side that **(WW 10- GK)** gets her right hand on to re-direct out of bounds for a corner kick, great reflex save by **(WW 10- GK)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' BD Miss: **(BD 3)** kicks a ball forward towards the left wing that **(BD 10)** tracks down and saves with a kick back into play, **(BD 7)** tracks it down and lays a soft touch re-direction pass down the left wing for a return pass to **(BD 10)** to receive, **(BD 10)** doesnt have much room to dribble and her first touch is a bit strong that the ball is kicked into **(WW 10- GK)** who smothers the ball and **(BD 10)** crashes into and falls on top of **(WW 10- GK)**, **(WW 10- GK)** remains in the game!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~15' BD FOUL: **(WW 02)** chest traps the ball and takes a shot on target that **(BD 3)** blocks with right left arm that was by her side, **Coach DaeSe** vehemently argues that it's not a foul and the ref shuts him down, a direct free kick is awarded near the top of the 16yard box slightly favoring the left side!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~16' WW Miss: **(WW 23)** takes the direct free kick with a pass to the left wing where **(WW 29)** takes a one-time shot that hits **(BD 3)**, the deflection goes to the left of the BD net and **(BD 27- GK)** tries to catch the ball from going out of bounds but she bobbles it losing control as she turns around making the ball's path to the front of the goal mouth, **(WW 29)** tries to muscle her way in to take a shot but **(BD 27- GK)** manages to recover by jumping on the loose ball with outstretched arms!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~17' BD Miss: **(BD 7)** takes one-time volley shot that is easily smothered by **(WW 10- GK)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' WW Miss: **(WW 02)** takes a sideline kick-in with a deep speedy high cross that **(WW 31)** barely misses, the ball goes out of bounds for a goal kick!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' BD Miss: **(BD 10)** takes a quick sideline kick-in with a cross that **(BD 7)** one-time volleys, the ball goes up rather than on target, and **(WW 10- GK)** catches easily!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~18' Injury Break: **(WW 31)** calls for some time as she needs attention on her pulled calf muscle, **(BD 7)** goes down for some calf stretching assistance from her teammates, **(WW 31)** subs out for **(WW 8)**!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' WW Sub: **(WW 8)** subs out for **(WW 31)**, for a very brief shift!&lt;\n\nHighlights:&gt;!~19' WW Miss: **(WW 23)** takes a sideline kick in with a play call of \"2\", the low cross is touched by **(WW 29)**, which takes a lot of the ball speed off and re-directs for **(WW 02)** to take a shot on net that is shot to the bottom right corner that **(BD 27- GK)** tracks down and blocks with her left hand, the ball goes out of bounds for a corner kick, a great chance missed, a great finger tip re-direction by **(BD  27- GK)**!&lt;\n\n\nFINAL SCORE LINE:  &gt;!------- WW 0 - **1 BD**------------, a decent even match up, sad to see BD not once subbing in Kassy, a great boost to BD morale, and even more messy result that gives all ChallengeLeague teams a chance to be promoted or suspended, Goal differential and Goals scored will now be a huge factor for the rankings of all ChallengeLeague teams.  What a great season with all games being played competitively, WW competed and had good chances, KiSum came up with big saves!&lt;\n\n**PREVIEWS:** &gt;!GV v GT, looks like KyungHee will not be playing goalie which means GT has some life in their field play. OMG looks like HyunYi is taken off on a stretcher! that is not something we want to see!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;",

            "comment": "The goalkeepers for both teams here are the real winners, definitely showed that they are some of the best in terms of reflexes and their ability to distribute the ball. &gt;!Kisum had some saves that were really top level goalkeeping.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Balladream currently really feels like they only have 2 players that are able to actually string passes and dribble the ball at a decent level. Lisa really hasn't shown much, Kassy doesn't even play 1 minute because even the coach knows she's nowhere near ready, and Seomoon Tak is a big liability. She might be able to just stonewall some players by having them run into her, but she is unable to shoot or pass purposefully. Every time the ball gets to her, I can almost guarantee that it will go out of bounds. (Also that handball where she just raises her arm????). Minseo was actually a good field player that showed that she could link up well with Seogi and Kyungseo, it's a shame that she has to be goalkeeper. Maybe if they can get Kassy good enough to replace Minseo as GK, it might give their field play that extra skill that's missing.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!GaYoung is so so good, runs like crazy and has really good power in her shots. Definitely could've made all the freekicks. She is one of the players that I think can carry her whole team on her back if she can just get a little help.!&lt;",

MinSeo, KyungSeo, and SeoGi made the difference.\n\nHongJa was average, SeolHee average, GaYoung top form, KiSum top form, Amy avergae for the minutes she played, and HeeJung average.\n\nAll played with tenacity, though, so the tension in the game was intense.  \n\nI loved that MinSeo was a back pass option.  I really want her to develop that part of her game too.  Or like u said to possibly get her in the field and develop Kassy as their main goalie.",

                    "comment": "With the current status of BallaDream, they will be unlikely to get promoted. Like you said, they were missing three players that can adequately contribute to the team. If you are gonna play fast tempo football, you will need fit players, which they don't have. KyungSeo ran out gas half way through the first half and she was their work horse. Lisa and MoonTak were not even fit enough or skillful enough to keep the team stable. I think they better stay in CL since they are not ready for SL. I just hope that they will not suspended for next season.\n\nWonderWoman played passionately as always. At this juncture, they are a complete team in CL. Physical, tenacity and skills can be found in all their players. It is a balanced and the best team in CL. Kisum just found her position and she is killing it. All the six players can rotate heavily without causing damage to the team. They are the monster for CL.",

If it wasn't for Kisum this game could have been a massive loss, I also thing GaYoung was worried as she played a lot deeper than usual not one of the teams in the CL is ready for SL. Think WW need a new coach they should be a lot better than they are now with the players they have on paper, they kinda remind me of Anaconda play way below there level.",

Coming off her goal line to make saves was in stark contrast to the many stay at home goalies.  I hope she develops to be the best goalkeeper in the league.\n\nMinSeo was good too\n\nBoth goalies showed awesome reflex/reaction saves.  \n\nNext week's  previews for GV vs GT looks like each team scores and KyungHee is out in the field and JeongSun got special one on one training to upgrade her confidence and skills.\n\nDecent game today with lots of chances, saves, and an even match up.  All the teams are improving,  even with the changes in personnel.",

I want them both to win! \n\nOk is kisum the best GK on the show? Her saves were insane. I also love her new hairstyle! Minseo is also killing it though.\n\nSeolhee's giraffe headers are so funny \n\nKisum is so gangster saying she'd rather die on the field \n\nOmg ballad coach running behind the goal to position his players for the free kick, i'm dead \n\nI feel kinda bad that kassy didnt get to play at all. Wouldnt she have been a better choice in the last 2 min compared to an injured KS who couldnt kick or run?\n\nOmgggggg i love gav and giants too, next week looks like a drama!",

I feel like BD really need Minseo up front right now. Its basically just poor Seogi and Kyungseo trying to make something happen against 4 players in defense. The saddest sight is using Seogi as the target man in the box for set pieces because BD has no one else who can contribute to offense. Lisa is lethargic and invisible, with almost no contribution to link up play, and Tak is poor both with her technique and decisions.",

Basically just go back to the original formation with SeoGi and KyungSeo on offense. They can still stick with fast tempo play, but at least they burden doesn't necessarily falls on KyungSeo. MinSeo and MoonTak should be capable enough to handle the defensive line.\n\nTheir next match is with FC Gukdae who are less fit, less physical amd less skillful. Other than MinJi bursting open with speed, they should be able to handle them. Plus I don't think Gukdae can handle this much pressure like WonderWoman.",

However for Balladream, esp Lisa sometimes got out of position which got backdoored by WW forwards tho their tactics of **setting their own pace and tempo to caught the WW on suprise is great but physically demanding** - que on Kyungseo since they can\u2019t rotate. Well I\u2019m interested on how Kassie is gonna be dipped in as sub GK unless she\u2019s gonna be a 2-way player like Kyungseo did before.!&lt;\n\n\nFor Wonder Woman, like Balladream &gt;!they come up good set pieces which is look promising even they missed a lot. Since all of them got involved on every piece, *well practice makes it perfect* so it would be a great arsenal for them as a offensive option for team.!&lt;\n\n\nFor a tiebreaker chance &gt;!WW has more chance to score more than BD since that\u2019s how Hong Ja and Kim Ga Young operates, they\u2019re gonna press until you break so for BD, Seo Moon Tak and Minseo did a great job to extinguish the fire especially those threatening free kick from mid.!&lt; love the match that will go on either way.",

            "comment": "1. Love both of these teams. Watching them play each other was both tough and fun. \n2. The announcers finally mentioned being suspended for the first time this season. So that's still a thing with FC Anaconda to be unsuspended by next season. \n3. These goalkeepers... they are aces. I've said it before, if Kisum isn't the best in the league she's near it and just needs more screen time to prove it. Both made great saves, throws and can play really well on the field. \n4. They won but I was not a fan of the game-plan for Balladream. Not using their best skill, tiki-taka, in favor of running Kyung-seo ragged like a dog just isn't it. They'd have been MASSIVELY screwed had WonderWoman scored even just one point. Kyung-seo's kick during a shootout woulda been weak and inaccurate due to how exhausted and strained her legs are. \n5. Am I crazy or is Amy a big upgrade over Hong Ja? Absolutely nothing I saw from Hong Ja in this match makes me like her starting over Amy. I like Amy's play, even though she's relatively new, and would have loved to see her start. \n6. WonderWoman's offense just wasn't enough. Going against one of the top goalies on the show with Hong Ja who missed every opportunity presented and didn't make any herself and Gayoung doing everything she can but she's not so good that she can do it alone against a good defense with a really good goalie. Seolhee is exciting and does a nice thing here and there but you can't rely on her to add plus value to the matches often. \n7. Just out here to say Kisum has my favorite psyche in the whole show and WonderWoman as a team has my favorite mentality of all the teams. The positivity, the good body language, the good communication and such are so good. That's especially hard for a goalie when you're allowing goals and yet Kisum is instantly doing and saying the exact right things. Amy is also particularly positive, vocal and strong minded. \n8. I adore Seolhee and the BD coach. Her comments were fun and they seem cute. Not a loveless or jaded couple. They used to be on Same-Bed-Different-Dreams and I wish they were on another show together (with ENG subs). \n9. The Challenge League is really fun with their quality of play and parity! Not to mention I like every team.",

Hong Ja is better technically and as shown in the anaconda game  has the calmness in front of goal. She has good positioning and gives more physicality in defense which is very very important in the challenge league. Amy is better suited for a game like this episode because of the pace of the game and Hong Ja is better suited for more slow paced games in my opinion.",

But with the amount of firepower they have in Jin-Kyung, Kyung-Hee, Hyun-Hyi and the original Hong Soo-Ah, Song Hae-Na, it should be an easy win against the Gavengers. The Gavengers are so unpredictable though, you never know, Nami might break out of her slump and just take over the game like she did post season 1. The Hye-Hye duo are always dangerous on both sides of the field too.\n\nAlso Hyun-Hyi getting stretchered out of the game in the previews mirrors their defeat against FC World Class in Season 1 though. I do hope the Giants win 2-0 but I wouldn't be surprised if FC Gavengers pulls it out via PK shoot out again.",

In the beginning of the episode I was questioning myself if the staff had actually messed up KyungSeo's makeup (overdone blushes/cheeks), or that it was just wacky color grading by the editor?!?  But then I realised &gt;!she was already so gassed out this early and sweating/heating up like a tomato due to having to carry the team both on offense and defense. It was all her doing the running...!&lt;\n\nEver since their captain left, not only did they lose a good defender, but they also lost Seogi as a player aswell &gt;!because BD defenders literally can't string more than 2 passes together if the buildup starts from them and thus their whole gameplan with Seogi as playmaker is gone now. It's really painfull to see her playing in defense while she is the smallest/weaker player on the team. Only due to her good decision making she barely manages ok... !&lt;\n\nWW now is what they should have been last season, 5 fit/very fit ladies, but without running around like headless chickens. I actually think they are the scariest team on the show to play against, the overwhelming difference on a physical and skill level compared to other teams is shocking &gt;! and I don't know how they haven't won this by 5-2 or more... MinSeo is a beast!&lt;",

Relegation and so few games means every single game is critical, so every team is going to field their best players for as long as possible. So teams aren't getting the necessary match experience to experiment and try things which are conducive to long term development, and thus the skill level stagnates. \n\nThe other side of the coin is that no relegation means there is not as much incentive to improve, and thus the skill level stagnates. \n\nI don't know what the middle ground is honestly. Maybe a separate practice league on another broadcast day, or just remove relegation and increase payouts for the top teams of CL and SL. So there still is the incentive to improve, but not the harsh elimination threat that deters teams from taking risks.",

And the show pride itself for improvement for players who had no or little prior experience in football. I somehow feel is not right not to play for a single minute and is not even a final game. Every team also had it fair share of not so good players but I see other coaches try to improve and put them in to gain experience. Yong pyo did that. Goblin cho did that too.",

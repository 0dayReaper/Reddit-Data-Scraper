Police suspect that the cause of death was suicide.\n\nhttp://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20191014000871\n\nVery sad news. She seemed to be in a happier place lately on Night of Hate Comments. Always felt she was sadly used as a punching bag by netizens for anything she did. Thoughts go out to her friends and family. RIP Sulli.",

Norms are changing, but toxic masculinity is not any worse than some western countries. Catcalling is almost non existent (old men do it) in Korea while young men are the primary cat callers in Europe/America.\nThe current administration has been pretty feminist (legalizing abortion, employment for women, and making it legal for sex workers to seek help), but it's interesting that you being up \"sexually liberated\" societies considering the current administration banned porn recently. \n\nIts important to note that the feminist groups (like the Ministry of Gender Equality and family, which is called the ministry of Women in Korean) in Korea don't really mirror the feminist movement in the West at all. Banning porn, censorship in television, Womad, etc, all dragged the term \"feminism\" into the mud for korean men  AND women. (Fb is a good indicator of this.)",

I have only been watching Korea since 2012, and in that period the social mores seems to have moved forward like Danmark from 1960-2000, so the state effort to modernize have born fruit. Of course the regressive 'think-of-the-children' brigade has latched on to feminism - this has (AFAIK) happened everywhere. In a patriarchal society it is hard for women to admit to an interest in porn, so I guess that it is up to the more liberated men to publicly argue that pornography is not inherently sexist)",

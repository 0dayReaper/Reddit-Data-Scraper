I like these episodes because the cast is interacting more but the places they visit are so boring and a lot focus goes onto the places they visit and it's just... uninteresting. Except for that meat mountain and storytelling restaurant. Those were the most interesting to me. Every single non-food episode was very interesting to me.",

The cast isn\u2019t good at spotting fakes, for the vast majority of episodes every location is chosen by at least one person.\n\nAlso Jessi\u2019s winning streak was complete luck, she never had a reason for any of her choices. \n\nI\u2019d like to see them work together next season and the regular cast only gets one vote for the group that they have to agree on. With the guest getting their own separate vote. So with a total of 2 votes to win money, it will be way more likely for the crew to fool the cast or for all of the cast to win.",

Like normal people build restaurants, so its really not a surprise that the production crew can replicate them. Especially with how the show is edited the viewers basically have nothing to go off of and clearly the cast members can find anything since there is almost always an even distribution of votes.\n\nIts  a bad sign that we haven\u2019t had an episode where all of the members picked the same place and won. Also it should be more common for production to fool everyone. Have they even had an episode where they fooled everyone?\n\nInstead these types of shows work so much better when its framed as  Cast vs Crew. Some of the best 2 day 1 night episodes were when they got the crew involved.\n\nI also think it\u2019d be more interesting if the crew put more clues into the locations in an effort to taunt the cast like when they morphed 3 faces together, or had a guy they knew dress up to try and conceal his identity.\n\nAlso I think the energy would be even better if they were working together and not keeping information to theirself.\n\nI think they need to pick better games for the hints and the hints need to actually be worthwhile. Its such a cop out to give hints that only make it more confusing.",

The cast were able to show excitement without being creepy, and IVe members were able to engage just fine. Maybe because Yujin had really great experience in variety while shooting Earth Arcade, and were able to relay it to other members, but I feel like they're doing just fine. In fact, I laughed so much in this episode, probably more than the amount of time I laughed in the past 10 episodes. YJS's interaction with Rei was just gold.\n\nOh, and also excited about next week's guest :)",

The cast always ends up working extra hard for idol guests especially female ones. There's just too much pandering compared to seasoned guests like Youngji who fit in well. It's running man, not weekly idol.  Hopefully next week's episode will be better.",

It didnt really help when YJS said on his team out loud that they should observe the other teams eat.

Donnie Yen is in South Korea to promote \"Sakra\" and Running Man is one of the longest running variety shows in South Korea.\n\nHe's not there to visit Hyung In lmao. People really throw out the term GOAT for free these days. The cast is also carrying her from her lackluster concepts.",

                            "comment": "Reddit handle kinda checks out.... Haha\n\nYes the GOAT term was used loosely. It's a stupid concept in itself, how can someone even be the greatest of all time until we're at the end of time? Appreciate the background on guest appearances though. Surely she has some kind of pull? On KJK's YouTube interview with the PDs she mentioned having guests lined up for a few months ahead\n\nPersonally I think Hyung In has done a better job than Bopil. I've enjoyed her episodes more, even if the concepts haven't been amazing, she is letting small moments from the cast shine through the edits. The retro dance from Somin during that outdoor episode comes to mind",

            "comment": "I was completely wrong about the salary thing (I'm glad), instead they went with more of a Yoo Quiz concept with Jaesuk and his assistants. The intro talk show did also remind me of Knowing Bros but instead of Hodong yelling and acting cute, Jae Suk's smooth MCing effectively allowed most of the members of IVE to get their moment to shine. Rei did much better than I thought though the RM members' reactions played a large part in that. The rest of the episode was alright, but honestly thought the theme and the way they executed it was boring. At the very least, there were a few highlights from the random talks b/w the members and IVE looked comfortable so it didn't hinder the experience. It's been a while since we got a full idol group guesting so I was worried but the members worked hard throughout to add in anecdotes to help make the girls' segments more fun.\n\nI'm really looking forward to next ep with Jang Hyuk and Donnie Yen. The mansion dojo thing they got going feels like it's gonna be constant slapstick and the members joking and having fun acting out their martial art fantasies. Speaking as someone who also at one point in their childhood dreamed of becoming a martial arts master, this ep is gonna be super fun for me.\n\nedit: forgot to add, one of the most wholesome moments for me was watching Liz mention in the bus about watching RM when she was younger, then dreaming of becoming an idol and wondering if she'd appear one day. instantly, i remembered that scene from How Do You Play's latest ep when Haha and Jinjoo were asking kids about water ramyeon and the kids were so excited and one even talked about his nuna liking RM a lot. it just hit me that wow RM has been here for nearly 13 years and is absolutely a staple in the industry. while it had its peak and some ups and downs throughout the years, it was able to become such a strong memory for so many people. ofc i hope the pds will do a better job and make the eps more fun again but at the same time, im just happy we got as much as we did for as long as we did.",

Otherwise you might get a mail with a legal punishment (usually you'll have to pay X amount of dollars or something like that). That costs money but it is way cheaper than getting punished xD.\n\n2- Use firefox webbrowser, install ublock origin addon (just google it and install it, not difficult). This is an adblocker, which will protect you when entering any random torrent website. Other browsers like chrome are being shtty against adblockers, so be careful with that.\n\n3- If you don't want to enter the torrent website, you should just copy the **magnet** link and paste it on your torrenting app, or click the **magnet link**, it will popup a window asking if you allow this website to open magnet links, then it will start downloading the file automatically on your torrenting app (unless you have multiple apps, which would complicate things a bit more).\n\n4- Subtitles are usually uploaded/shared by u/dramajoe in a comment on each episode, the link they use is a text link website called 'pastebin', where you open the link, there will be 2 texts with the link of whichever website you prefer to use, for one I tend to use zippyshare but mediafire is just as good, if not better. Always use ublock origin addon when entering any of these websites though.  The .ass files tend to be better as they have more complex and customized fonts for whichever words are translated, but .srt is just fine too.\n\nRemember to thanks joe and anyone who shares useful links for their effort whenever you download stuff here, it doesn't take long and its free! (Just be grateful\\~)",

I especially like how carefree and joyous Jihyo's laughs are, it's really nice to see her becoming brighter again.\n\nI've said it before but I really wanna keep Rei in my pocket. She has the variety character that makes me laugh so much because it's unpredictable. Reminds me of their guesting on Amazing Saturday where I had so much fun watching her with Donghyun lol Also, her segment with Jaesuk struggling reminds me of the interview JS had with Oh Hyuk lmao I recommend it for all the awkward responses and shows how great JS is in handling variety newcomers.\n\nA really great episode. Everybody had their moments and as always, the banters were A+!",

It is not for comedic effect nor she wanted the filming to be over. It's just her personality.\n\nI do agree that spacing out is not great, but calling her rude is a little bit too much.\n\nShe does make some great moments in the show with YJS vs Rei.\n\nI don't think Yujin carried the show.  I think Rei, Liz, Wonyoung, and Yujin have their moments on the show.",

Just because she is an idol thus she get a free pass. If she is not and have average looks, I bet netizens will be up in arms what a waste of space she was in the epsiode.  Jihyo even though she do not contribute much to the show and silent most of time of time. you can't honestly tell me that jihyo space out the way rei space out in the epsiode ever. At least jinyo pay attention to what going on and try to take part in the show\n\nRei is totally spacing out and not giving 2 shit to be honest. She totally look she does not want to be there. This is evidently when YJS call her out repeatedly twice.",

Kpop is just 3 or 4 big companies dominating everything and the ones that are actually talented getting nothing because they're not in those companies. They're also very young so just how good can they possibly be? Although, I guess snsd and others also started very young... But mostly the songs are just terrible. Sorry. \ud83d\ude02 I'm probably too old for it anyways, but none of the songs sound good to me. They all pretty much sound the same and are rehashes of other songs and the lyrics are ridiculous. Music videos have nothing special in them, it's all just the same old same old doll up idols and no story, the dances make no sense and don't tell any cohesive story either, the looks are getting more and more artificial. Again, I'm just probably too old for this. Kpop idols my age will have to retire in a year. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI think Hyori basically explained my thoughts perfectly here: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/lg8dWCk7xto\n\nOf course, not all groups.

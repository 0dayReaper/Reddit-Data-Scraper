    "postText": "Hi I watched my first kvariety show (Hyemileeyechaepa) and was wondering if there are other similar ones that don\u2019t feel too scripted? I tried Earth Arcade and I\u2019m still only 3/4 through episode 1 but it feels really scripted and structured compared to HMLYCP, I watch Youngji on YouTube but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the biggest fan of this group\u2019s dynamic so far. Should I continue with it or are there better variety shows for what I\u2019m after? I think it\u2019s mainly Lee Eun Ji as she plays an over the top character but it feels so theatrical.\n\nI liked the editing humour of HMLYCP too and their individual characters like Miyeon being the princess but also a massive dork, Yena being the cool girl, Chaewon being a cutie and getting angry easily etc \n\nThank you for any recommendations!",

            "comment": "I\u2019d recommend continuing Earth Arcade. It only seems scripted because of the preshow meeting. Earth Arcade is actually probably one of the least scripted shows on korean TV. They don\u2019t actually know how the format of the show will work, they are kinda just winging it, the only thing they know for sure is that they will play games for food. \n\nI also dislike Eunji for the same reason but don\u2019t say that too loud otherwise blind fans will try to call you a hater. \n\nI am happy to report though that EunJi seems to have mellowed out more in season 2, as her fellow members start calling her out for her fake bullshit. \n\nThere is really amazing moments in Earth Arcade. The girls of Earth Arcade are so much better at dancing and recognizing songs than Hyemileeyechaepa, and Earth Arcade tends to show more behind the scenes storylines.\n\nI actually think Earth Arcade is a better show than Hyemileechaepa, although I agree that the Yena and Chaewon duo in particular is amazing.",

As far as I know, a lot of non-Korean people do not really like Korean comedy style because the casts have the character similar to Eunji which, for some people, see it as 'cringe'.",

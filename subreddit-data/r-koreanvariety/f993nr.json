He's been in the industry since the 90s, a big name  on TV since 2005 with great track record (xman, FO, Running man), getting money from his music and concerts. LKS, YSC, JSM definitely won't be, JSJ wasn't really that successful before RM, SJH and Haha just isn't as big",

And like the only other person to have won the Triple Daesang award.\n\nSure, Jong Kook has been pretty successful with his shows and all, but he's still an extremely successful singer whose concert tours often sell well.\n\nAnd honestly, despite the ban in China, his songs still rank pretty well on the Chinese charts. \n\nHe probably makes good money from his shows, but a good chunk of his income probably comes from all the concerts he does (excluding the RM fanmeets). \n\nAnd whilst having your own label does help, it doesn't guarantee much profit. But, as someone has mentioned, he's had his own label for awhile \"The Turbo Company.\"",

Ever since Kjk guested in China RM in 2014, things changed. \n\nIt was reported that Deng Chao's salary for 1 episode of CRM is more than YJS's entire year's salary in RM. Which is not a surprise since China entertainment is well known for being generous. \n\nKjk is very well-received in china after his 1st guest appearance in CRM. The people went crazy about him. They voted him as the most popular artist - YJS came 2nd. When he went China filming, instead of reserving 1 hotel room for his stay, the entire level of the hotel was reserved. Subsequently, he did RM movie, 2 china shows (10 episodes each show), released chinese singles, tour china concerts, filmed multiple chinese advertisment and god knows how many more before the ban started.\n\nWhile rumor said that YJS is getting USD8500-10,000 per episode in RM, there was a rumor about Kjk receiving USD1.2million per episode in china. If he filmed a total of 20 episodes, he already pocketed USD20 over million. And we have yet to calculate everything else he did. His 1 year of activities in China probably earned him much much more than his 20 years of work in Seoul. \n\nI am not surprised if he is secretly the richest RM member instead.",

There was a rumor that YJS received 7-8mil won (approx USD6-7k) per episode during 2006-7, it wasnt only until 2011 then he started getting 10 Mil won (Approx USD8500) per ep. So from 2002-2010, i doubt he is making millions annuals unless we are talking about Won not USD.\n\nSay, if he hosted 4 shows. 1 show he gets USD8500 x 52 weeks = USD442,000, multiply by 4 = USD1,768,000 a year. From 2011 till now he probably made USD17mil in total through hosting alone. \n\nNow, if Kjk indeed received USD1.2mil per episode, then just 2 shows of 20 episodes gave him USD24mil, which is more than what YJS worked for in 10 years. We have yet to count the number of advertisements, concerts tour, events, movie, and all sort of other stuffs Kjk did in China.\n\nAs crazy as it sounds, that is how much china's willing to pay. If you watch \u91d1\u661f show (a china talk show which you can find on Youtube), the host did mentioned about this salary issue (she brought up the topic of Deng Chao's salary vs YJS's in RM too). \n \nThat dude you mentioned, is probably Kim Soo Hyun. Kjk is the 2nd most popular celebrity after him. So if Kim Soo Hyun earned about USD20mil just through ads and events, we know Kjk is not too far behind. \n\nWell, am glad that Kjk managed to earn a fortune before China banned hallyu. As for who is richer, at the end of the day only Kjk and YJS knows. It doesnt really matters. What matters is they are 2 very kind and generous souls.",

Whatever float our boats i guess.\n\nYeah, i believe Sjh managed to get quite a fortune the same year as Kjk. Actually most RM members are popular in China. According to Sohu's popularity award (for variety), Kjk won with 120 Million votes (I placed my votes too lol). While Yjs was 70 mil, KS was 13 mil and Sjh was 3 mil (she came in 4th if im not wrong). Im not surprised that she actually has a fat bank account.",

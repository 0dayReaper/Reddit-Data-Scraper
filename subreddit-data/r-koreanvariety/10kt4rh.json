    "postText": "Hi everyone! We made a [website for the contestant profiles of 'Physical: 100'](https://www.mykpopshows.com/physical-100). The first 2 episodes are great so far and we were curious to know more about the contestants so we compiled all of them in one place. The profiles include a bit of information about them and their social media accounts.\n\nWe'll continuously update the website with more photos and information while the show airs. Don't worry, it's spoiler-free. Hope you guys like it!",

I really needed this especially because I saw so many familiar faces but couldn't place their names (all those military peeps in Iron Squad, those YTbers, and var show guests). Also can't believe there are two contestants here (Euddeum and Kkangmi) also in the new Shooting Stars soccer team. Didn't expect to enjoy this show as much as I did so I can only hope the rest of the eps stay entertaining.",

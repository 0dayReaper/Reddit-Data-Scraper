    "postText": "I just watched this week\u2019s episode of MUD with Lee Sang Mom\u2019s blind date and my heart feels so full. \n\nI loved every moment of the blind date from the way she kept reassuring him, to the way he laid out all his cards on the table. I know LSM\u2019s situation is always the butt of the joke most times, but here, you could see how much it really hurt his self esteem. She was so kind and lovely too, I love the way she was so articulate and sure of her self, (I appreciate a strong and confident FL). I also loved that &gt;!he gifted her a thoughtful gift!&lt;. \n\nTbh there was a point that I was close to tears towards the ending when he said &gt;! He came with no expectations and he beats himself up to be perfect and she mentioned how she feels bad that he suppresses himself!&lt;. I feel like LSM might have shed a tear or two afterwards in private because he couldn\u2019t at anything for a minute after she said that. \n\nAlthough there were some moments when I hid under my table (when he &gt;!mentioned his ex and asked about hers\ud83e\udd23!&lt;).\n\nAll in all, I\u2019m just happy there are people out there that can see LSM for the kind hearted and sweet person he is. Maybe I\u2019m a hopeless romantic but I loved it so much it felt like a warm hug that I really needed. \n\nThings I took away from this episode: Put you self out there you never know when you\u2019d meet a gem. We also need to speak kind words to build people up.",

He is by far the most thoughtful cast member. He thinks about things that only rare people think about. For instance, when Bakgoon got married and he gave him a generous wedding gift \ud83d\udcb2\ud83d\udcb2\ud83d\udcb2and they asked him why he did that he said it was because he wanted Bakgoons wife &amp; family to know what BG, an ex soldier with no living parents whom society could still slightly look down on had someone strong behind him, someone supporting him. Someone in his corner with some \ud83d\udcb2. This immediately resonated with me because I have done something similar for the same reason. He understands people more intuitively than most and he is a beautiful friend. I just want all the good things for him. He also has IMPECCABLE taste and I think that he will make a wonderful husband at this later stage in his life if he let his guard down. It must be incredibly difficult for him at this point. But I\u2019m rooting for him !",

This guy deserves to have a happy ending in his life.\n\nBut the dark, cynical side in me surfaces when I remember Kim Jong Min and Hwang Mina from Taste of Love. No matter how much I enjoy on-screen relationships, if the guy doesn't look that good or rich then he's not real relationship material for these girls. It might be the romantic in me speaking but I'm getting tired of these good men being strung along for no reason, emasculated for humor on public TV. There's a reason attractive female entertainers can easily say no to Jo Seho, Yoo Byung Jae, and Yang Sechan, but scream shrilly at the next handsome actor they barely know to guest in their shows. I know that in Love Me Actually, Sechan got all the girls interested but in the end they didn't continue a romantic relationship with him.\n\nBakgoon was objectively handsome so everyone could see it working out for him. I could also see Mijoo starting a relationship with Yikyung, [she seems interested outside of HYDP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_BVVfteq30), I'm getting Kwangoo/Sunbin vibes from them. But something like Gary and Jihyo? Sechan and Somin? Nah, which is why I'm finally happy for Gary when he got married and had a kid almost immediately after stopping RM.\n\nMight be why Seo Jang Hoon barely cares about meeting women anymore.",

                    "comment": "the skeptic in me has me thinking it will likely not lead to a relationship. the good part of me believes that even if they don't date and it's a show of sorts, the way sangmin acted had me thinking Yuri at least had an impact on him. it could just be sweet words but those sweet words could bolster him and with his debt soon gone, it's a nice affirmation that he can and should be proud he clawed his way out of bankruptcy and is not the loser and beggar everyone playfully likes to joke about. \n\nas for the prettiness factor of celebrities in finding SOs, ofc that plays a huge part. how attracted you are to someone matters a lot, especially to celebrities who often have to constantly go after a certain \"level\" in order to be accepted. exceptions do happen though and say what you will about some of these not-stereotypically-handsome men, is that they are all relatively successful and often are funny and charismatic enough to overcome some of those differences. as evidenced by some of the gagmen couples you saw in the recent eps is that one's preference might not line up with the conventional standard and you can still find happiness even if your SO is not good-looking. \n\nif a guy thinks a woman is out of his league but is confident about himself and willing to go for it, then that's cool as long as he understands the risks (rejection, being strung along, etc.). in fairness, it should also be the same for women even though there is a bit of a double standard here. understanding those risks is key and in those shows you've listed, im sure the cast understands it is a show first and foremost and they're playing it up for the drama. they're probably more tired of the discourse surrounding it and being labeled one way or another than the actual interactions with the fellow castmates. finding someone out of the scrutiny of the public eye (as much as possible given they're celebrities) is critical for a longer lasting relationship and likely why even if SJH has someone, he wouldn't want to make a big deal out of it until he's ready (if he ever) decides to disclose it.",

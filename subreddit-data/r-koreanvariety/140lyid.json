            "comment": "If you don't mind getting spoiled, try looking up fancams of their performances from busking events or university festivals recently. Seems like they all sing live, but with varying volumes of backtrack at different parts\n\nFor Uhm Junghwa, it's quite obvious in this [fancam](https://youtu.be/HlJXDJET4Gc?t=69) when she asks the audience to sing along. You can hear the difference when it's just the backtrack at \\~1.11, and when she sings her parts again at \\~1.25.\n\nLee Hyori is also fairly obvious [here](https://youtu.be/oUUkwKWIrLk?t=6), especially when she almost laughs &amp; when there's some differences from the backtrack depending on the choreo. She also doesn't really hide whenever it's just the backtrack during the \"dancebreak\" parts\n\nBoA generally uses a louder backtrack, especially at the parts with more intense choreo. But one can hear subtle differences btwn her actual voice &amp; the backtrack when she's starting her line at \\~6.26 [here](https://youtu.be/IDXEPlo39OU?t=386)\n\nHwasa also has a louder backtrack, but the difference btwn her actual voice &amp; backtrack is more discernable. Also helps that for the [Mamamoo medley](https://youtu.be/E8rSVr4pMmo?t=71), she keeps her members' voice in the backtrack. So if one recognises the different Mamamoo members voice, they should be able to pick up Hwasa singing on top of it\n\nFor Kim Wansun, based on [this](https://youtube.com/shorts/cVJ8LFyeURo?feature=share) &amp; [this](https://youtu.be/40xLRL79BbQ) I think she's singing live with fairly minimal backtrack. But I'm struggling to find a full recent fancam of her performing with a handheld mic (mostly coz many recent fancams are from the university festival performance where she used a headset mic)",

That's why I personally prefer using audience fancams\n\nBut I suspect some of these performances will be officially shown in later episodes, hence the warning about potential spoilers",

I don't think any of them are fully singing live but I think Wan Sun is singing the most out of all of them. Way too much dancing for live singing. That would be pretty rough I think. Not everyone has the breath epicness of Ailee ;)",

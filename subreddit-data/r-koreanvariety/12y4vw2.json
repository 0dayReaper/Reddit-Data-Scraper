Sad to see it end. \ud83e\udd72 \n\nToo many episodes, guests and cast members to fully capture everything but I hope we can see them again on future shows. \ud83e\udd70 \n\nGoodbye, Master in the House \ud83e\udd17",

I missed LSY who was my favorite in S1.\n\nI cringed at the original idea that one member has to sleep in the same room as the master (must be so awkward) but enjoy the original concept otherwise. Personal favorite episode (for lesson learned) was with Yang Hee Eun and her song \"Mother to Daughter\".\n\nBut to be honest, since the original members left, it has been going downhill and I have been skipping watching more often than not.",

    "postText": "'Peak Time' is a brand-new idol competition program in which teams battle for the chance to become the next worldwide idol group. Unlike other audition programs, its contestants consist entirely of male idols who have already debuted, whether currently active or part of a disbanded group.\n\nOnly the top 6 finalists would be able to reveal their group name on the show, and those 6 teams would be participating in a \u201cPeak Time\u201d concert tour. The final winner will receive a grand prize of 300 million won (approximately $232,932), as well as the opportunity to release a new album and hold a global showcase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rival Match Round (Continued from last episode):**\n\nThe judges divided the teams into eight rival pairs. The two teams then faced off with performances of the same concept, with the winner of each match earning double the total of their first round global votes.\n\n|Concept|Team|Performance|Results|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Emotional|Team 15:00 (&gt;!BLK!&lt;)|[BEAST - '12:30'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0eRum462bs)|&gt;!5 votes (Win)!&lt;|\n|Emotional|Team 7:00 (&gt;!MASC!&lt;)|[GOT7 - 'You Are'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWS79c5MkwU)|&gt;!3 votes (Lose)!&lt;|\n|Synchronized Dancing|Team 5:00 (&gt;!ATBO!&lt;)|[SEVENTEEN - 'Hit'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiDYt_aWgDE)|&gt;!6 votes (Win)!&lt;|\n|Synchronized Dancing|Team 9:00 (&gt;!BLITZERS!&lt;)|[BTS - 'On'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy3qxzh8wTc)|&gt;!2 votes (Lose)!&lt;|\n|Girl Group|Team 8:00 (&gt;!DKB!&lt;)|[AFTER SCHOOL - 'Bang'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj2-Qh9tEwk)|&gt;!6 votes (Win)!&lt;|\n|Girl Group|Team 2:00 (&gt;!NTX!&lt;)|[GIRLS' GENERATION - 'The Boys'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWRRpiZ7h3I)|&gt;!2 votes (Lose)!&lt;|\n\nThe contestants also voted who they think did the best in the rival match round. The winner gets to change any of the combined teams once in the next round. The winner is &gt;!Team 11:00 (VANNER)!&lt;.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Combined Unit Match Round:**\n\nA training camp was held for 3 days and 2 nights. During the training camp, they will prepare for round 2. Out of the 16 teams, 4 teams become one combined team. Each team will form a vocal, dance, and rap unit. The vocal unit must have a maximum of 6 members. The rap unit must have a maximum of 5 members. The dance unit does not have a maximum number of members. The units of the four teams will compete. The winning unit of each position will be selected by the judges. The winner of each match earns 2% of the total votes.\n\n|Team|Members|\n|:-|:-|\n|Team A|9:00 (&gt;!BLITZERS!&lt;)|\n|Team A|2:00 (&gt;!NTX!&lt;)|\n|Team A|18:00 (&gt;!BDC!&lt;)|\n|Team A|5:00 (&gt;!ATBO!&lt;)|\n|Team B|20:00 (&gt;!M.O.N.T!&lt;)|\n|Team B|8:00 (&gt;!DKB!&lt;)|\n|Team B|21:00 (&gt;!24K!&lt;)|\n|Team B|23:00 (&gt;!DGNA!&lt;)|\n|Team C|11:00 (&gt;!VANNER!&lt;)|\n|Team C|13:00 (&gt;!BAE173!&lt;)|\n|Team C|15:00 (&gt;!BLK!&lt;)|\n|Team C|24:00 (&gt;!Soloists\\*!&lt;)|\n|Team D|7:00 (&gt;!MASC!&lt;)|\n|Team D|14:00 (&gt;!GHOST9!&lt;)|\n|Team D|4:00 (&gt;!BXB!&lt;)|\n|Team D|1:00 (&gt;!DIGNITY!&lt;)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rankings for the 'Peak Time' global vote by episode 4 was as follows:\n\n1.

However, there were parts of every performance where they were all singing live.  I wonder why they did the \"synchronized dance\" battle twice.  Just watching the two performances I thought it was a \"prop dance\" challenge and judged the Hit group for throwing the ball out so quick.  Was really impressed by 7 and 15's vocals, but I think 7 are still slightly better.  It's nice to see the global vote mostly lining up with who I'm picking.  Super proud of group 11 and 23.",

            "comment": "another good episode! and the drama starts as the combined group mission started X\"D\n\nfor the 1st round performance though, my favorite is the girl group theme, both team chosen were the high energy ones and the arrangement they did was something exceed what I expected. The dance break also good, even though they weren't part of the synchronization theme, but both of their performance really solid\n\npersonally,I feel it was too bad for emotion theme groups, honestly both have good vocals, but I agree with what the judges said and feel both of the groups couldn't really bring out the emotion itself\n\nfor the combined group though lol, here comes the drama. I personally think for group C - rap, both &gt;!Heedo!&lt; &amp; &gt;!Hyunjae!&lt; need to sat down and found the middle way so both of them not goes after each other neck later. As for dance team, I think it's understandable the way people learn to dance definitely different. They definitely got pressured because of the interim check as well, adding the mess more than there is.\n\nby the way, since they have training for 3 days and 2 nights, I kind of want to see their dorm or room arrangment at least (if there is) and probably morning mission just for fun or something fun between the tension",

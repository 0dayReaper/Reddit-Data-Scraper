    "postText": "**Show:** Adventure by Accident (\ud0dc\uc5b4\ub09c \uae40\uc5d0 \uc138\uacc4\uc77c\uc8fc)\n\n**Description:**\n\n* A no-plan, hard work variety show documentary! Kian84 has been running nonstop in a patterned daily life for 10 years. He finds himself in a state of burnout so he chose to find his real \"self\" by  going to the other side of the world. Kian84 sets out for South America  with only one bag on his back along with Lee Sieon, a real brother to him, and PaniBottle, a travel YouTuber. It can't be  more raw than this. From the moment they get off the plane, you can't predict what's ahead. This is the three men's crazy trip to South America!\n\n**Links:**\n\n* [Official website](https://program.imbc.com/AdventurebyAccident): Sunday at 4:30 p.m.\n* [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/745119-adventure-by-accident)\n\n**Cast:**\n\n* Lee Sieon (\uc774\uc2dc\uc5b8)\n* Kian84 (\uae30\uc54884)\n* PaniBottle\n\n**Panel:**\n\n* Simon D (\uc0ac\uc774\uba3c \ub3c4\ubbf8\ub2c9)\n* Jang Doyeon (\uc7a5\ub3c4\uc5f0)\n* Lee Seunghoon (\uc774\uc2b9\ud6c8) (Ep. 3-onwards)\n* MINO (\uc1a1\ubbfc\ud638) (Ep. 1-2)\n\n**Torrent:**\n\n|Torrent|Magnet|Subtitle|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|720p-NEXT|magnet:?xt=urn:btih:5cf74c1b313b0d80c6d9eb4a46db38eaa15d54e1|[Subscene](https://subscene.com/subtitles/adventure-by-accident/english/2991833)|\n|1080p.F1RST|magnet:?xt=urn:btih:72e7c6f0ea6325c0b6c7c735e77980b0a39ec464|N/A|\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Kian and Sieon are such a gold combination, love them so much! I always love Kian in ILA but I come to love him more after watching ABA, he suits traveling so much. Can't wait for the next adventure!",

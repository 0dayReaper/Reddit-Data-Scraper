    "postText": "It is only me or do you guys also think this year has a lot of content show about drinking? Personally, I didn't like their culture of drinking. Especially When they constantly bragging how much they can drink etc. \nIs it because youtube so they can put out more content than broadcast stations can't or this is only a trend? I understand if they can relax more when drinking and sometimes if the guest is the introvert ones, so the show is more interesting. \nWhat do you guys think?",

I don't have a good opinion on drinking to excess and Koreans don't really drink in moderation. \n\nKorea is a couple of decades behind other developed countries in terms of how they treat mental illness, addiction, regulation and restriction of drugs and medications. It's quite taboo to highlight any negative qualities of drinking as drinking to excess is an accepted part of the culture. Recreational drugs are very hard to come by, so it's alcohol or nothing.\n\nAs long as the alcohol variety shows are entertaining I will keep watching them, but it does leave a bad taste in my mouth when someone drinks to the point of being comatose and no one cares. Like the recent episode of My Alcohol Diary with Jin where the host passed out in the toilet.. \n\nRe: some of the comments in this thread, I also think it's pretty facile to argue that binge drinking/encouraging binge drinking (like getting rewarded for drinking in Heechul's show) is totally fine and everyone needs to accept that Korea is just \"different\". It is different... but not in a good way. Look at the suicide rates. \n\nDrink in moderation yo, or better yet just smoke some green.",

Honestly the trend of drinking shows was already a thing with shows like Life Bar but it especially exploded during COVID. (Or maybe it was around the time SWF was airing, I have a bad memory lol). The rise of YouTube variety also allowed them to actually drink and go wild on the shows, instead of just calming being drunk and talking. \n\nThe drinking culture there is already very supported(?), I guess that's the best way to put it. You've got top stars like IU and Jennie promoting soju, you have kdramas all about drinking, it isn't that surprising variety shows are also joining in on the fun.",

Alcohol is a huge advertiser basically everywhere it exists and of course they go hard on platforms with young demos (like YouTube and Kpop) but they have a tough time on TV I would imagine due to the regulations K-tv likely has with drinking. But they can supply cases of beer, soju, whiskey, etc for K-content on YouTube as subliminal advertising or have the host do an advertisement spot during each episode itself (like Heechul basically shooting a booze commercial and his guests joining in during 'Street Alcohol Fighter'). That show can exist because it was designed from the get-go with alcohol sponsors/ads supporting it the whole life of the show. \n\nSo if it's a quick, easy and \"fun\" content creating way to have a YouTube channel that works for both men and women (unlike say being sponsored by beauty products) then you're gonna see a lot of channels with shows utilizing this.",

            "comment": "I think alcohol and \"drinking\" gets a bad rep in many parts of the world. I do admit that too much of nearly everything isn't good but alcohol is also used in many cultures to show trust, friendship, and respect. What we might see as a reason to have fun and say stupid things is actually a very important part of some cultures. Without it there's no way to move up or relax. Sounds weird but its truthful. \n\nIt's sort of like how many \"western\" shows show affection by hugging, physical contract, or even kissing. In some other parts of the world that's a big big no no but in other parts there would be no other way to express how a person feels - or at least it would be harder to express feelings.",

They also don\u2019t tend to have adequate mental health resources and it\u2019s looked down upon if you need it. And yea, I think all these are related.",

            "comment": "I notice that too, but again it's not shocking looking at their drinking culture that is widely accepted and acknowledged there, it's just their norm and culture. As a someone who don't drink (and smoke) it's quite concerning (?) when I watch the shows about drinking and they're boasting about alcohol tolerance and dependence, like they can't live without it and need to drink alcohol everyday. Personally I don't like it especially because my bias loves to drink too, but I just come to accept that it's their culture, as long as they drink responsibly then that's their life and choice, and if they ruin their lives just because of drinking then that's on them. I'm still can watch any drinking related shows in YouTube as long as it done moderately and entertaining, but I won't watch someone got wasted because of alcohol.",

I have never seen an idol or influencer from korea say thay don't like drinking. Even if they don't, they pretend to like it just because the general public like it so much imo.",

            "comment": "As a Malaysian where we generally don\u2019t have as prevalent a drinking culture as they do in Korea and other East Asian countries, I find it genuinely alarming how much drinking is outwardly promoted in Korean variety shows.\n\nSure, I do enjoy a tipple occasionally during the odd special occasion, but not to the extremes they take it. I\u2019m the kind of drinker bartenders hate, I\u2019ll order a beer and nurse that motherfucker for a couple hours (I tip well tho). I\u2019m sure drinking offers great release from the daily grind and has its positives but I\u2019ve seen firsthand what the negatives are and that\u2019s why my drinking habits are the way they are. I\u2019ve seen bar fights, people walking into traffic while inebriated, DUI-related accidents (some fatal) and people being taken advantage of while intoxicated.\n\nI could go on with my rant but I\u2019m tired so I won\u2019t. In closing I\u2019ll just express that I don\u2019t support drinking shows and I show it by not watching drinking shows like Tipsy Talk and My Alcohol Diary.",

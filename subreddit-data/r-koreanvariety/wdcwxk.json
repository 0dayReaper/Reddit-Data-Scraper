The fact that Choi Hyungin &gt;!and her house played a big role in the hide and seek name tag game seems to have been a little foreshadowing into her promotion.!&lt; \n\nGood luck to her.

I've forgotten the ep numbers but just this year he had several \"make your own game and we'll adjust\" moments. That one where KJK played the *Getting over it* game in PC was so hard to watch. \n\nI'm not saying the other PD's are perfect though, there are also EPs pre-300 that bored me to death. But I'm watching 317 now and the difference in production/games are just wow.",

            "comment": "Was expecting this to happen soon since RM has a new PD every 2-3 years, but this is still hard to read! He and his team had so many heavy challenges to overcome during his tenure, and he did it with a lot of charm. I think he interacted the most with the cast on-screen as a PD and almost felt like another member from his easy banter with them. \n\nWishing the best for him! Can't wait to see what he will do after getting a nice break.",

One example is during that whole indoor mission where they had to run on some giant roller pin and sign their name with black paint on their hand - One of the members (I want to say Sechan but my memory is coming up short) spun the wheel sneakily and got away with it - affecting the member's time to finish.",

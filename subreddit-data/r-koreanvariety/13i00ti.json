There will be no report today. So please watch Lets Play Soccer (\ubb49\uccd0\uc57c \ucc2c\ub2e4 \uc2dc\uc98c 2) on kokoatv yourself (look at the comment section for link). \n\nLet me know your thoughts down below. For those that don't understand Korean, I will try to answer your question as best as I can. \n\n(P.S. The game is so good that you have to see it yourself. Make your own judgement and lets discuss Ep93's trailer too).",

Throughout the match, the opponent gave Eojjeoda Avengers a hard time to the point that they risk injuries. Heo Min Ho, Im Nam Gyu and Ryu Eun Gyu gave the best of themselves in the game and almost suffered injuries. \n\nEojjeoda goals did not come easy for the team. \r  \nEojjeoda made a goal 10 mins into the first half. \r  \nthen Jeonbuk scored a tie 20 mins into the second half, which affected Lee Jangkun so much. \r  \n\r  \nLee Jang Kun made a number of wrong moves and decisions throughout the game. When Jeonbuk scored a goal,he was disappointed with himself, after a few minutes of wallowing, his teammates said, \"\uc7a5\uac74\uc544 \uad1c\ucc2e\uc544\", he got up and resume the game. \r  \n\r  \nChilgu was the first to console jangkun. second, andre and third AJW.\r  \n\r  \nShortly after the score became tie, Dae Hoon scored a tie breaker goal 2 mins after the equalizer goal. Lee Jangkun cried so much for joy that the team broke the tie. \r  \n\r  \nJeonbuk gave the eojjeoda avengers a hard time. Based on my tally on attempts on trying to score a goal, Jeonbuk made more tries than Eojjeoda. Reason could be, Jeonbuk's defense and ball handling techniques are more efficient than Eojjeoda or Eojjeoda made numerous errors during passes that they gave Jeonbuk the chance to score a goal.\r  \n\r  \nJeonbuk 12 tries - 1 goal\r  \nEojjeoda 10 tries - 2 goal\r  \n\r  \nI know the team members are still adjusting with the new members and I hope that in the upcoming match, they will have a better game play and will emerge victorious.\r  \n\r  \nEojjeoda avengers fighting.",

I thought they want to fight when Heo Min Ho and Ryu Eun Kyu collided with their players and when Lim Nam Kyu tried to talked with the referee. Tbh, I'm kinda waited for some drama between them. Luckily, no one is injured. \n\nIt certainly wasn't easy for Kim Yong Sik to score but his pass to Lee Dae Hoon before the first goal is kinda good. Kyu-Gyu smart play during free kick is so cool. I swear to God they must have been best friends in their past life. Its a shame that no one can score the goal after that. Hats off to Lee Dae Hoon and Han Geon Kyu. I would like to see more of Lim Nam Kyu's shooting. If you watch our last matches after the 3rd audition, Lim Nam Kyu failed multiple times during shooting outside penalty box and the ball are either went up to the sky or hit the goalpost. I'm not sure if being a winger can mess with your shooting accuracy in front of the goal. \n\nHonestly, I'm quite tired of Lee Jang Kun. This might sound harsh but what were he doing during the past months while other players keeps improving their play? I know its an entertainment show and the ups and downs in soccer is inevitable but how can you fucked up so bad? From a good striker that everybody relied on to playing in the defense. In my opinion AJH is being too nice to him. It's good to see him trying to do his best and I hope he can maintain his performance in the future. Come back Lee Jang Kun. You still have some fans that are waiting for you. Don't disappoint them and dont be greedy. Focus on the defense first and when you are confident enough go for striker position if you can. Dont depends too much on your power, use your brain more. You are a legend in Kabaddi. There's nothing to be afraid of.",

Maybe soccer is just too hard of a game for him because it requires a lot of mental capabilities as much as physical. I just wish he would improve more and right now be a reliable defensive player.\n\nThe game itself though was the best yet so far for me because there was intensity and drama at the same time \ud83e\udd23 The opposing team was also very good and very skilled which makes the winning part feel very good. \n\nThere was also Han Gun-kyu that was very reliable as a Goal Keeper. His supersave of the shot from the halfline stood out to me. At this point, I believe that the other GKs Lee Hyung-taek and Kim Dong-hyun are just there for the comedy \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

Between a ticking timebomb and exposing Han Geon Kyu to injury, which of these can guarantee our spot in Gyeongsang-do and Jeju Title Matches?",

We should have got more GKs during the 3rd audition. Lee Hyung Taik and Kim Dong Hyun will only drag everyone down with them.  Its like you are stuck between winning the match with Geon Kyu and/or risking him to injury. Hopefully, nothing will happen to him. \n\nI hope Eojjeoda Avengers wins all the match. Seoul will be our last Title Match, although nothing is decided for now. If we win all of the re-match, we might go for Seoul next? I dont know what will happen after that. I really hope that they will continue this show even after Title Match Tour ended. It will be a shame to end the show after going through all of the hard work and all of the auditions.\n\nYour comment is so sweet. My main intention of writing  the post is to attract more people to watch the show. It will be great if more people are talking about the show and discussing the players' performance. I never thought amateur soccer could be such fun entertainment. To anyone who is reading this, please write more posts about the show. We can discuss the match, the player's performance etc etc.\n\n(P.S. I want to watch more of Lim Nam Kyu shooting. \ud83d\ude2b He's kinda afraid to shoot the ball outside the penalty box after a few failed attempts during the 3rd audition and in the early 16 System matches\ud83d\ude2d.

Of course there were mistakes to critique and a variety of plays to praise, but they gave everything they had on that field\u2014I'll let that passion talk for today. Onwards and upwards!\n\nOn a lighter note, it's a bit hilarious how well GyuGyu match up on the field despite Eungyu (jokingly) complaining about how Namgyu never returns his calls. Truly the KaneSon of the team! \ud83e\udd23",

While Ryu Eun Gyu is quite close with Lee Ji Hwan. I think our captain is a bit shy ?\ud83d\ude05But when it comes to their chemistry on the field, everything comes out natural. \n\nThe free kick part is unforgettable. Eun Gyu's eye contact directing Nam Kyu to make a run and how Nam Kyu understands him and fooled the opponent. Its just beautiful. If only someone can score a goal after that smart play.\n\n(P.S. I thought Nam Kyu and Min Ho were the Kane and Son duo. Is Nam Kyu the Kane in this combo?)",

They're either always missing each other or they're just not close, which is fine, just super funny. Minho and Junhyeon are definitely the social butterflies of the group though so it's not surprising they meet/train with everyone.\n\nYou're not wrong about the show calling Namgyu + Minho KaneSon a couple of times! But Namgyu links up well with both Minho and Daehoon, and since GyuGyu have spent a lot of games matching up as a striker/winger combo I've taken to calling them KaneSon instead. I think they fit the nickname a bit better. Even the \"business partners\" angle matches, haha!",

    "postText": "Yoo Jae-suk's quick and wise response prevented the crisis from spreading in the entertainment industry.\n\nIt is known that broadcaster Yoo Jae-suk was diagnosed with Covid-19, and his careful handling prevented the spread.\n\nOn the 13th, Yoo Jae-suk's agency, Antenna Entertainment, announced that Yoo Jae-suk tested positive for COVID-19. Earlier on the 10th, Antenna's head Yoo Hee-yeol was diagnosed with the virus. According to the agency, Yoo Jae-suk had completed the second dose of the vaccine at the end of September, and on the 11th, after receiving notification of close contact with the confirmed person, he immediately performed a PCR test and tested negative.\n\nYoo Jae-suk, who tested negative, was switched to passive monitoring rather than self-quarantine, but for fear of the spread of COVID-19, he avoided outside activities and contact with outsiders as much as possible on his own, and checked the situation with a self-diagnosis kit from time to time.\n\nIn the process, he was scheduled to attend the wedding of Lee Ye-rim, daughter of Lee Kyung-gyu, a broadcaster, and Kim Young-chan, a soccer player, on the 11th, but Yoo Jae-suk asked for his understanding in advance and stayed at home. Yoo Jae-suk, who arrived at the filming site ahead of the SBS 'Running Man' shooting schedule on the 13th, waited in the car and conducted a self-diagnostic kit test first in case of unforeseen circumstances. As a result, when suspicious symptoms appeared, a PCR test was performed immediately, and the diagnosis was confirmed on the same day.\n\nYoo Jae-suk's careful treatment prevented the large-scale spread of COVID-19. About 100 guests, including many celebrities, attended Lee Kyung-gyu's daughter's wedding, which could have caused an emergency in the industry due to a group infection. Also, by avoiding face-to-face contact with the cast and crew of 'Running Man' without getting out of the car, the 'red light' was avoided throughout the program.\n\nWhen the process was revealed until he was confirmed, netizens continued to praise Yoo Jae-suk's calm and cautious response, saying, \"As expected, God Yoo.\" It is an opinion that as a \"national MC\", he showed the most exemplary steps related to quarantine. Fortunately, as of 5 p.m. on the 14th, there have been no additional confirmed cases related to Yoo Jae-suk. Yoo Jae-suk is currently canceling all scheduled schedules and taking self-quarantine and necessary measures according to the guidelines of the quarantine authorities.\n\n[https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=417&amp;aid=0000764563](https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=417&amp;aid=0000764563)\n\n[https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=629&amp;aid=0000121652](https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=629&amp;aid=0000121652)",

But if you do your job right, nothing notable happens (plane takes off successfully, or apartment remains standing).\n\nPeople need to be reminded every now and then of the potential consequences of screwing up, preferably without actually screwing up. So they know even though there's no reward for doing things right, you still don't want to screw up. I think this did a good job of summarizing the huge damage it would've done to the industry if YJS had acted with less caution. Reminding people that in times like this, it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nSame thing happened with the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The entire disaster could've been averted if the manager running the plant had dumped seawater into the reactor to cool it. But dumping seawater inside essentially kills a $1 billion reactor because of corrosion. So on the one hand was the certainty of a $1 billion loss, on the other was uncertain future consequences. He was scared enough of the certain loss, that he chose the uncertain future consequences. But the future consequences turned out to be a disaster which will cost hundreds of billions of $ to clean up.\n\nSpeculative pieces like this help to give certainty to uncertain future consequences in people's minds. The more people hear about cases like this, they more likely they are to make the right decision in their personal lives. (I miss a friend's wedding, or unknown consequences if I go. vs I miss a friend's wedding, or hundreds of people get sick and have to stay home from work for weeks.) And it being about someone as popular as YJS guarantees a lot of people will hear about it and become better informed, and hopefully make more correct decisions if they think they're sick. Especially in a society like Korea where *not* attending events like a wedding can be viewed as an insult.",

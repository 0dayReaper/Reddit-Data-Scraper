    "postText": "Apparently, [Yoo Jaesuk, Cho Saeho and most of the crew were not informed of the President-elect\u2019s appearance prior to the interview](http://www.topstarnews.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=14686344)\n\nNow I haven\u2019t been able to see the full interview (if anyone has a link, please drop it!), but I\u2019ve seen a few clips floating on twitter and [you could feel the awkwardness](https://twitter.com/lovstoryzip/status/1516757396072239106?s=21&amp;t=g3kTO3daz0XrstaryyVHcA) from the screen. I don\u2019t even understand Korean, but I could tell that Jaesuk and Saeho were extremely uncomfortable, that coupled with the crew\u2019s [utter silence](https://twitter.com/lovstoryzip/status/1516761416597864451?s=21&amp;t=g3kTO3daz0XrstaryyVHcA) the whole time. [Even the editing seemed pretty shady lol.](https://twitter.com/b_______613/status/1516749392770125833?s=21&amp;t=g3kTO3daz0XrstaryyVHcA)\n\nNow, do you guys think the PDs arranged this and jumped ship or do you think it\u2019s some execs that forced this interview to happen? Judging by the amount of resignations at tvn i\u2019d say it was some exec\u2019s dumbass decision. The interview seems to be a hot topic on twitter among knets, what are your thoughts on the whole thing?\n\n\nUPDATE 21/04: [Reports are saying that Moon Jae-In had previously contacted the Yoo Quiz team for an interview but the production team declined saying that politicians as guests don\u2019t fit the program\u2019s concept ](https://entertain.naver.com/now/read?oid=108&amp;aid=0003046586). This was confirmed by[Moon\u2019s Secretary of Protocol](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2022/04/secretary-of-protocol-for-the-moon-administration-confirms-that-they-requested-moon-jae-ins-appearance-on-you-quiz-in-the-past-accuses-cj-enm-of-lying) despite CJ ENM (owns tvn) saying they had never gotten a request by Moon. Prime Minister Kim had also reportedly asked for a spot and was also declined. \n\nWith this in mind, I think the whole thing is just about to get messier as more news leaks out. Why was Yoon Seok-Yul invited despite this? Who invited him exactly?\n\nAnother small update 21/04: [it looks like this incident is making the news](https://youtu.be/V7RtpDERgbU), wouldn\u2019t be surprised if more leaks/reports emerge over the next few days/weeks. I never thought I\u2019d see YJS in the middle of such a political controversy\u2026",

I've seen very few, if any criticism of YJS &amp; JSH and even the PDs/crew so that's some silver lining I guess. The optics thing is kind of funny in how blatant and obvious it is, but it's so dangerous for what it *could* mean.\n\nReally keen to hear insider scoops of *how the hell* this happened, but I suspect we'll have to wait 5 years, when the presidential term is up to get the tea. \n\nAlso, as an Australian, the clips sort of remind me of the [Johnny Depp/Amber Heard dog apology](https://youtu.be/ORpBAIB9j64).",

Haha\n\nYJS: Why does it feel like we\u2019re (the three of them on screen) the only ones laughing\u2026..? How come our staff are not laughing? \n(T/N: YJS trying to save the situation/comfort the president?) I mean, the president came to film with us, so it\u2019s a bit different from the usual atmosphere. \n\nP: I mean wouldn\u2019t the atmosphere be more comfortable/stable as the filming goes on? \n(To YJS and JSH) Please help me a lot haha \ud83d\ude00\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nLol even the tweet\u2019s caption in the second video said \u201cYoo Quiz seemed difficult. (President was) a mood killer.\u201d Personally, it was awkward and as if YJS and JSH didn\u2019t want to be there \ud83d\udc80 I\u2019ve never seen YJS like that before, like he wanted to finish this asap, and I\u2019ve watched him for over 10 years and his energy is never this low.\n\n\nEdited: Added translation of first clip! And as usual, a disclaimer that I\u2019m not fluent in Korean, just an intermediate learner~\n\nEdit 2: [This tweet](https://twitter.com/hyunsuinseoul/status/1516976604785696768?s=21) is fking funny lol. Ngl, the president looks like a gangster when he manspreads as soon as he sits down and YJS and JSH are just like \ud83d\ude10\n\nEdit 3: Thank you for the award! :D",

Whereas here he's like mentally checking on his wife and kids and making sure they're not harmed every 5 minutes. \n\nThis must suck.",

Yoon Seok-yul is just reckless, how can you force yjs and bts, your country\u2019s biggest cultural assets, to platform you literally weeks after you\u2019ve been elected?? Like what?? \n\nMoon never went on variety shows (to my knowledge), but through the UN ambassadorship given to BTS he was able to insert himself in entertainment both domestically and internationally while also maintaining a certain distance because the boys acted in an \u201cofficial\u201d capacity. He was brilliant at projecting soft power despite my misgivings about certain parts of his admin.",

Like if I was YJS, I would be absolutely fuming at the guy. YJS came across as professional still despite that, but you could clearly tell he was very unhappy with the whole thing throughout. I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t pull back on some of the faces he made, you could clearly tell what he felt written on his face throughout the whole thing. \n\n\nWonder what will come out of this still in the next few days, the interview has basically gone viral in SK.",

Despite some claiming that the entertainment industry in korea is apolitical, it obviously isn\u2019t, it\u2019s just a lot more subtle when compared to US shows.

What we\u2019re witnessing right now in SK is part of a cultural shift amidst a polarizing society, you can\u2019t feign impartiality on these issues if they come to define the type of person you are seen as\u2026",

If the hosts were blindsided I imagine Yoo Quiz PD might have been too or else why wouldn't he have informed the hosts? \n\nI don't doubt the PD's might have been against the President and that played a part. But it's even easier to imagine they left because the leadership at TVN forced politics onto one of their entertainment programs and was shady by not informing the hosts before it happened.",

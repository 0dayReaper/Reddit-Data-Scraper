Before the dudes appeared, these girls got SO much criticism and hate \ud83d\ude41 people called them obsessive and couldn\u2019t get a hint.\n\nBut when SeJun and HyunGyu arrived and formed a relationship with them, a lot of people did a 180 degrees change and started leaving nice comments about the girls on the sub \ud83d\ude36\ud83d\ude36\ud83d\ude36 \n\nJust really baffled by the polarizing opinions! Some say it\u2019s because they the girls showed another side to their personality that is nicer and more people appreciated that. Some say it\u2019s the effect of the guys\u2019 presence and viewers envisioned themselves to be like the girls to be able to land such a great guy.\n\n[SoE\u2019s and HaeEun\u2019s polarizing reception](https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/109znzv/just_very_puzzled_about_the_polarizing_sentiments/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",

I guess So E built friendships with other members but that likely got cut on the editing table. Hae Eon was a teary mess for 12 episodes and I was frustrated as a viewer. Not sure if both shows edited her that way. I wonder what would SI reveal if it adopted the TL 20 x 2 hour format.",

More people wished for her happiness than people hating her. It was more about rooting for Hae Eun to finally get out of the shadow that is Gyu Min, hence the support for Hyun Gyu who was going for her and actually had what it took to do so. Plus, it's Hyun Gyu vs Gyu Min lmao even based on outer appearance alone, Hyun Gyu takes the cake.",

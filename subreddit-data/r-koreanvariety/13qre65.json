There's a big possibility all the eliminated people will be returning back (probably just) for the main match in the later eps when the contestants are too few. All of the eliminated players except kerrigan still have one clothes left in the teaser, and Fujii Mina have a money game win announcement that had not yet happened.  I thought Pie's red clothes could be from that ep, though you observed 3 left so idk anymore.  My prediction of Pi going was because she was only seen wearing one set of clothes in this week's preview. Though I'm not 100% sure. !&lt;",

If so, I don't think a spoiler tag is needed since one is just picking a person.   \nUnless there were more cast members in the beginning and were being eliminated, then maybe it could spoil things for people who aren't current.  \nI don't watch this show, so I don't know it's premise.",

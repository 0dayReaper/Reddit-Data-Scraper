    "postText": "[allkpop link](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2021/10/actor-kim-seon-ho-issues-a-formal-statement-of-apology-toward-ex-girlfriend-a)\n\n\nOn October 20, actor Kim Seon Ho released a formal statement of apology toward his ex-girlfriend 'A', after becoming wrapped up in controversial accusations related to his private life. \n\nRead Kim Seon Ho's statement, below.\n\n\n\"This is Kim Seon Ho. First, I sincerely apologize for my belated statement. When I first saw the news articles with my name on them a few days ago, I experienced a fear like I had never felt before, which is why I am only now presenting myself in writing.\n\nI dated this person with good feelings. But during the relationship, I hurt this person due to my incompetence and lack of consideration. I had hoped to meet with this person again in order to deliver my sincere apology, but I am currently unable to do so and am waiting for that time when I am able to do so. \n\nIn the meantime, I hope to relay my apology in earnest through this letter. I would also like to apologize to all those who trusted me and cheered me on until the end, for disappointing you. I was only able to stand tall as actor Kim Seon Ho because of the people who cheered me on, but I had forgotten this fact. I also take this time to apologize to the many people who worked with me on various productions for the harm which I have caused, due to my mistakes. \n\nOnce again, I want to sincerely apologize to all who may have been hurt by this incident. I know that these ramblings are insufficient to reach many people earnestly, but I offer my honest thoughts in any way that I can. I am truly sorry.\"\n\nPreviously on October 17, an anonymous netizen, who revealed that they dated an 'Actor K' in 2020, claimed that 'K' has persuaded her into getting an abortion, under the pretense of marriage. \n\n**Update: KBS has announced that Kim Seon Ho will be leaving 2D1N** [allkpop](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2021/10/kbs2-confirms-kim-seon-ho-will-be-leaving-the-cast-of-1-night-2-days)\n\nThe production staff of '1 Night, 2 Days' stated, \"Hello, this is the staff of KBS2's '1 Night, 2 Days' season 4. The production staff has officially decided that actor Kim Seon Ho will be leaving the program, after his recent controversy. He will also be edited out to the best of our abilities in upcoming episodes which were already filmed prior to the controversies, in order to minimize the discomfort inflicted on viewers. The production staff of '1 Night, 2 Days' will continue to do our best to create a good program moving forward. Thank you.\"\n\nAccording to various media outlet reports, the cast members of '1 Night, 2 Days' have also been notified of Kim Seon Ho's departure from the show earlier today. As of now, the next filming for '1 Night, 2 Days' is scheduled to take place on October 29. \n\n---\n\nSorry for using allkpop link but they are the fastest as usual :/ I had a hunch this was true due to how late Salt entertainment was replying + the vague message. Now I guess we'll have to see how the Korean society &amp; 2D1N react to this...",

It got pretty heated so I kinda understand the reasoning for it but I don't really think their blanket ban on any controversy was the best idea because they prevent anyone from talking about *any* controversy whatsoever under the guise of \"privacy for the actors\". Under that rule they also prevented any discussion on the bullying controversies last year and other big scandals like Seo Yeji's scandal from happening on that sub and there were people who said that they were completely unaware any of this happened. They don't really take any criticism of the rule at all either so it's been in place for the last 2 years.",

They are humans after all still, and no human is perfect. I\u2019ve noticed with the scandals coming out is that every victim points out how these celebrities are not even remorseful at all. They do not know to apologize. I, myself, am a victim of dating abuse, and during my time and was in the process of healing, I was only waiting for an apology and never received one. Apology really goes a long way along with proper actions to reflect.",

My ex used to ask me to not wear skirts that have a hemline above my knee lol and I listened to him to make him happy because it was more of a hassle to deal with him being annoyed/pouty/moody afterwards. Good riddance to him but now I do feel a bit silly for accommodating him in the past. And that\u2019s just clothing!

            "comment": "I wasn\u2019t into K-content before 2021 and the reason I started and continued was because I stumbled upon Start-up and loved his performance as Han Jipyeong (I\u2019m a huge huge huge fan of HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley and my best friend has mastered all things K-). Afterwards I was introduced to 2d1n and my love for the show outgrew my appreciation of him. He was one of my favorite members, so it\u2019s a huge disappointment to see that not only is he the opposite of the person he has shown on TV, but also a horrible and inconsiderate human being. As soon as I saw the news, I knew it was true. First and foremost, I\u2019m truly sorry for the woman and her baby, and I\u2019m also sad for Bang PD and the members and all the actors and actresses he worked with. 2d1n really had to avoid controversy. I had been thinking about this matter for a while, but I think he couldn\u2019t handle the fame with such a quick rise to the top. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to be aware of your own physical beauty to the point he was aware of it. So sad to see this unfold like this. He worked hard to get where he got and has fallen rightfully as a horrible person due to his actions and by hurting literally everyone who knows him. As for 2d1n, it will be hard to watch older clips that gave me comfort since KBS put all its eggs in one basket by using him as clickbait. By the way, I\u2019d like to congratulate Kim Jongmin for keeping being the good person that he is after 15 years on this scandal pit of a show. I hope he lives a good life during which all his wishes come true.",

Lots of gray areas, and some additional details this time about the ex's actions and motivations came up. All messy, but tbh it still doesn't change how tarnished his reputation is. They're both in the wrong, and they're both suffering from their actions, it's just that KSH's is a lot more public. It's super unfortunate and I do feel bad for him, but also.. actions have consequences, and they are both living with a heap of them now. \n\nAlso: anyone who says he's worse off or that she has less suffering after what she's been through needs to put themselves in the shoes of someone who's had to make the decision about her body that she did - the physical and mental effects aren't one-and-done \ud83d\ude36",

I mean, ofc we can't expect celebs to show their true colors 100% but man, this is a total 180\u00b0 shift from his image. \n\nThere's this one comment here suggesting that the fame might have been too much too soon for KSH which resulted in the issues and wrongdoings that he's done. I initially thought the same but  then I realized, this all happened (the pregnancy/abortion and alleged badmouthing of colleagues)  BEFORE he shot to fame with Start Up. So as much as it pains me to type these all out (because I was an avid fan and I've deluded myself with his online personality), it does look like KSH is NOT a good person after all and he is in fact \"trashy\" as A described him in her post. \n\nI just feel so bad for everyone who trusted him, most especially A and for the trauma she went through.",

It seems so dangerous for people to have these blind, obsessive parasocial relationships. I like that most people here on this thread have a deeper, nuanced understanding of the issues and aren't just supporting an actor because they like them or because the actor is good looking or talented. At the same time, I'm glad people are not cancelling on a whim and have also acknowledged other facts, like we don't know the full story with both parties. I think it's good to have mature discussions and examine all the information. Personally, at the end of the day, I feel I can't support an actor knowing that their sense of ethics is missing. I was never a big fan to begin with, but did like KSH's dramas, so I guess it's disappointing. I hope the victim isn't being harrassed and can heal fully.",

We all need this. I see a lot of people condemning the idolization of celebrities, but I think it's normal and necessary to look up to people. We need hope, good examples, and fun interaction with one another.\n\nPeople seem to think that this is what happens when people \"think they know\" celebrities... but this situation isn't unique to fans. You can be lied to and betrayed by a parent, sibling, friend, partner, etc. Everything he hid from us was probably also hidden from family, friends, and co-workers too. His ex-girlfriend was also deceived. This has little to do with admiring someone you don't know and everything to do with *Kim Seon Ho* being deceptive. I've seen a lot of people shaming his fans for trusting a total stranger and believing they knew someone they didn't, but that's just another way of washing him clean from guilt and making the victims in this situation look bad and feel worse. It is NOT a crime to trust people.\n\nBottom line, don't let people make you feel guilty for finding joy in others. There are plenty of people who can be lying about who they really are, but letting a crappy situation like this strip you of further joy and trust is just wrong. We are all human and should all make room for our family, friends, and favorite celebrities to make mistakes, but we shouldn't let the possibility rob us of joy.",

Then, when they have settled on the guest with best chemistries with him, they should stay and eventually form a core of permanent cast for those show.\n\nHonestly, who can be trusted at this point other than KJM?",

I'm never for one to air your dirty laundry in public but i can understand why his gf decided to do this (if its all true). She must be pissed as hell with him to do this. But i hope she expected that there will be a backlash for her actions as well. The media is already posting her images and her history bout her divorce, family etc... \n\nAs for KSH, aside his bad decisions and actions... I'm surprised that he will do such a thing in a relationship knowing that he's fame and career is on the line. I feel like both parties have a lack of common sense. They are both grown a55 adults that should have known better regardless of who manipulated whoever. And of course KSH was an ass for forcing her to do the abortion. Anyway, i think both parties are at fault and their lives are ruined.",

Apparently there was no other alternative. \n\nAccording to the translation of the girl's post - I advise you to read it in its entirety - he constantly belittled the show that gave him his initial popularity propensity - coff coff, Start-up -, he spoke ill of the screenwriter, of the director \"a madman with artistic pretensions\" - free translation - , did not recognize the efforts of the castmates who helped him to grow in his career, in addition to belittling the appearance of the second protagonist, calling her ugly and old-fashioned.\n\n What people, he and especially his fans, who would drag their faces at the roughcast if he recommended it, conveniently forget is that all this rabid and insane cult he built for himself would not exist except for the screenwriter's talent for writing such a complex and charismatic character, a role he was lucky to get and even luckier, I still don't understand how, to have his real public image associated with the \"nice boy\". None of this would have happened if it weren't for the quality of the script and the drama itself - including the direction and the rest of the cast. Ingratitude is a very, very ugly thing. Also, is he blind? Kang Hanna and Stephanie Lee are gorgeous. Speaking of her - I don't know who - as if he was Cha Eunwoo himself.\n\nHis career probably came to an end - at least in the direction of the stardom he was heading towards - not just because of the abortion issue, but in large part because no one wants to work with an ungrateful, fake asshole. It was at least annoying having to put up with his hysterical fans who idolize him as if he was Christ himself and associate the fictional character he interpreted as proof of his virtuous and pious morale, at the same time disrespecting and belittling the rest of the professionals who made that project become a reality.\n\nKim Seo Ho - as all artists - is a person of flesh and blood, with flaws and virtues, not a saint incarnate. I can't deny that it's at least a little pleasurable - schadenfreude - watching his fans react to this, although - obviously I don't know why I'm surprised - they're already squirming to defend their oppa.",

Lee Jong Suk is currently filming his comeback drama (Big Mouth) with \"madman\" Oh Choong Hwan. LJS said that he called the director and asked him what he was working on these days. He went on to say he was so impressed by Big Mouth that he asked if he could be part of it. This is significant because they worked together on While You Were Sleeping back in 2017. With who else? Suzy, the *actual* star of Start Up. Both her and Lee Jong Suk are seasoned actors in the business with many opportunities, and they've been outspoken about the honor of working with Director Oh Choong Hwan again. Who is Kim Seon Ho to speak poorly of him when he was a literal nobody before they met? If people in the industry (with far more clout) love, respect, and continue to touch bases with this director, it puts a bad taste in my mouth to think this guy believes that he's better than all of them.",

Obv private matters should be private, but when you're a celebrity, esp at the height of your fame, you'll be scrutinized to no end and these were the consequences \ud83d\ude1e I hope that KSH can learn from this and that he takes care of his mental health. What's more, I hope the rest of the 2d1n cast won't be affected too much by this. Wow, what a whirlwind. I guess we can't have nice things after all :/",

Of course its a shitty situation and I feel bad for the girl but I also do want to know both sides of the story. \n\nJust feels like in the western world this wouldn't ruin someone's fame as much as it would in Korea.",

It\u2019s the deception. The lack of morals and remorse for someone he supposedly loved. How to admire a person like that esp when in public he acts like he\u2019s God\u2019s second child?",

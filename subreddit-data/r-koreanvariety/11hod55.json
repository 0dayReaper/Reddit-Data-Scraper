But anyway I\u2019m 90% sure this list is correct.\n\nBefore this list I swore Chilku had more assists but after reviewing he usually assists a assist.\n\nPlayers:  Goals:   Assists:  MOMs:\n\nNamKyu    29           11           4\n\nJangKun    16            4           6\n\nEunGyoo     14           9           6\n\nHyeonWoo  11           10          4\n\nDaeHoon     11          13           4\n\nMinHo          9           10           5\n\nTaeHwan      7            2            3\n\nJunHo          3             7            1\n\nJunHyeon    3            5            2\n\nJiHwan        3             1             2\n\nWonWoo      2            4            2\n\nTaeBum       2            3             3\n\nChilKu          1             1             4\n\nDongSik       1             1             0\n\nAndre           1             0             1\n\nJe-un           1              1            2           + 2 own goals\n\nTaeSool       0             0             2\n\nDongHyun   0             0            3\n\nYoHan          0             0            2\n\nHyungTaik   0             0            2             + 1 own goal",

            "comment": "I'm kinda surprised they ignored the baseball player because based solely on his experience he is the best guy for this game. Baseball players are used to running and stopping, and he may be retired but 30 years of experience doesn't go away just like that. The first one was fast but track and field athletes are known for sprinting whereas the game needs more control and balance. \n\nBased on the preview I already hate the finals. I'm not really fan of games whose crucial moments are affected by eliminated contestants. This was the weakest point of The Genius and it seems they have not learned from that mistake. However whoever wins will deserve it. Jeseong would follow DongMin's footsteps proving comedians are the smartest people around. Jin Ho would be hitting that nostalgia buff and would feel great for fans. John would be the newest legend, probably has the best showing overall in the show and is undoubtedly the favorite to win right now.",

I didn't expect Je Seong to fare this far, but his social and adaptation skills made him survive. John Park, in the other hand, might be Jinho's biggest obstacle. His plays ooze confidence.

They said the result of the show is bit shocking (at that time I still don't know the rest of the cast) and because of that &gt;! I have been guessing that Jesung might be the winner!&lt; . I might be wrong and maybe they were saying the show itself is shocking (need to check it back). But then again, maybe they were just saying it like that to attract viewers.\n\nTruthfully, it was shocking for me to enjoy this kind of program. I have VIU and just random picked this show to watching while I'm eating. I thought I won't even finished one episode. I don't really enjoy watching shows that I need to think lolol. I couldn't even finish 1st episode of The Genius. Maybe because there were some funny elements thanks to Hwang Jesung and interesting alliance of JJJ. \n\nIn a way, this show kinda  reminded me of Survivor where alliances are important. Not to mention for next episode, it seems the guests that were outed need to do something that will help the final guests. Just like in Survivor where the people that were voted out will voted for the winner. I wonder what they have to do. Maybe sharing their remaining hours when they were outed?",

                    "comment": "Team D could definitely win and A finish last. Team D just needs to buy minus pins every time they go past their bucket and donate pins to Team A\u2019s buckets. This prevents Team A from playing optimal, they now are forced to stack up pins in a bucket so they can go past their safe and drop the minus pins on someone else. This also prevents Team A from being able to score the pins that overflow past your safe. The odds of the minus pin traveling all the way around and landing in your own bucket by an attack from Team C is pretty low odds. These players will gladly take the chance to sabotage a player next to theirself. This also helps prevent Team A from going out early on because you keep giving them extra pins that they can\u2019t score with. \n\nMinus pins are super cheap, and they exist for a reason. They don\u2019t exist so people can simply dunk it in their enemies safe, thats absurd. When you save up pins to dunk a minus in the enemy\u2019s safe you are donating them 5 pins on their board that they can use to score. If they keep their last bucket empty then they will immediately nullify your minus pin by scoring the pin you gifted them in their last bucket. This is why John always scored a high number of pins, because John does everything in his power to not give the team in front of him pins, he scores them instead. \n\nAlso, another really good technique is being fast at moving pins as well as stacking all of your pins in the third bucket so you get the least amount of penalty from having pins leftover in buckets, as well as not having to waste time running those pins. Ideally you start the game somewhat normal though and play like john and then switch to the bucket stack strategy as it gets closer to the end.",

            "comment": "The games in this show really bring it down. Feel like as a viewer you can watch and understand whats going to happen only a few minutes into a game. This episode in particular was especially bad.\n&gt;!No clue why they'd replay a game that is decided purely based on when your turn is. Theres zero incentive for players to work together at this point in the show. So its just guaranteed that team C/D are going to lose based on who team B wants to lose.!&lt;\nI'd expect the games to pick up in steam as there were less and less members, but these last two episodes have just been total let downs.\n\n\nAlso, since I wasn't around to post in earlier episode's threads, did anyone notice that you can just end Gold/Silver/Bronze instantly once you start a turn with 34+ tokens? Since the game ends once you have no more rabbits to put out, you can just put down every single one you have and immediately fold. This would end the game the next turn, and you would have 31 tokens to your opponents 29. I don't blame the players for not noticing, but it would've been funny if someone did while playing it.",

That way you can just win a couple hands and run out of rabbits before the opponent can use their high value rabbits.",

John absolutely killed it in this episode, he spent the least amount of time, had the best score and had the best teammate. Jinho continues his streak of weak performances. He could have easily lost if it were not for Jeseong's help denying Hyunkyu points.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!This is first finals in a game show where I'm equally rooting for all the players. They absolutely deserved to be in the finals and strategically outmaneuvered the competition. As teased, the eliminated participants will be able to help the players so here are my guesses:!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Jeseong: Hyunkyu, Eonkyu!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Jinho: Jiyeon, Layone, Monika???

    "postText": "I do, the player You Ri-An I really think they should have added him I know they said the reason was because if they took him they would have to face other teams that also have former players. Buttt we all know that was BS Nam-kyu, Won-woo, Minho, and Junho all played soccer even if Junho was only a few months. Annnddddd let\u2019s not forget almost every other team they faced already has one or more ex-players on the team. Idk why they gave that excuse but they should\u2019ve added him even if it meant cutting a player (like Hyung-Taik \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02).\n\nAnd while we\u2019re on the subject why\u2019d they make the bluff that they were gonna cut people? Y\u2019all think it might still happen in the future if the show goes on longer or did they say that just to knock some sense in the players?",

            "comment": "Its a shame that they let You Ri-An go. He made a great CB.  I think maybe because AJH wants to work with what we already have, like JangKun  Andre, Park Je Un, and Wonwoo? Or maybe because You Ri-An sibling is a pro footballer and AJH doenst want to show favours?\n\nI mean, it's football. They need to create some sense of urgency in players to get their act together. If there's no competition, players will not improve. But it also can backfire. Like JangKun's case. His performance was down badly after Nam Kyu got into the team. Much worse, he lost his confidence little by little. I think AJH tried to balance the team with entertainment and sport. Hence, they need Hyung Taik, Dong Hyun, Jang Kun, and Tae Bum. And also if we think about it these four are from a talent company. So maybe AJH need to promote them more as a part of the contract?\n\n(P.S. This show taught me a lot about the reality of being an athlete. You are replaceable. Kinda glad that I'm not an athlete, tho).",

There\u2019s a few players who wouldn\u2019t of passed the last auditions. \n\nI don\u2019t really care about variety show guys but I would\u2019ve hated to see Hyungtaik and Donghyun leave so I guess I have mixed feelings. Atleast they\u2019re good locker room guys.",

            "comment": "IIRC, the reason AJH decided not to pick any of the former players was because the skill gap between the ex-player finalists and any future opposing teams with ex-players wasn't big enough to justify a spot on its own. Unlike in the second audition, where the team was having trouble beating opponents with even a single former player.\n\nI can't speak for the variety factor though! Of course that's going to play a part in the tone of the show (like the longrunning joke about booting Hyungtaik and Donghyun) and the direction the staff take. But I'd like to think they let AJH &amp; co. be pretty serious seeing how they've raised the stakes higher throughout the show.",

Even if one of them is good at football, it will be nothing if there's no teamwork. There is no chemistry with new members so far.\n\n(P.S. I'm from the future, btw \ud83e\udd2d)",

            "comment": "I think You Ri An should have made the cut as well. Sure, he wasn't dazzling but IMO he did well enough to earn a sport on the team.\n\n&gt;Buttt we all know that was BS Nam-kyu, Won-woo, Minho, and Junho all played soccer even if Junho was only a few months.\n\nTBH, I think they only consider Nam Kyu to be former player. The others you named weren't considered former player as they did not used the \"\uc120\ucd94\" (former player) term on them.\n\nAs for the reason about having many former players on the team and needing to find opponents with former players, I think it is more about not being too overpower for the amateur teams that they are playing against. Afterall the Avengers are a team of national athletes of other sports, just by their stamina and physicality alone, regular amateur teams can't win against them. Only strong amateur teams with years of experience and a couple former players can play evenly with them. So it's kinda like \"Other sports national athletes that's been playing soccer for ~2 years with 1 former player\" vs \"Amateur soccer teams that's been playing together for many years with 1-2 former players\". So having more former players on Avengers would tip the scale too much in their favors and they need to play against stronger teams to ensure a fair match and Anh Jung Hwan probably felt that the former players in the audition were good enough to tip the balance but not good enough to help the team win if they played against higher tier teams.\n\nAs for the cutting of players, I think it is just to create some drama and sense of crisis for the existing players. They weren't gonna cut any players IMO. Since Asian Games is coming up so active athletes like Jang Gun, Junho and Hyun Woo will be away from the show in the months preceding the Asian Games (selection, training camp, actual games). Hyung Taik and Andre are also coaches for the national team of their respective sport, so they will be out for similar period as well. Je-Un, Won Woo and Eun Gyu are active athletes as well. Even though their sports are not in the Asian Games, they probably have their own national and international level games.\n\nBut what I can't understand is that the newly auditioned players are also active athletes (esp the Rugby and TKD players), so they would also have to be off the show during the same period. Unless they are retiring or they aren't first team on their sports?",

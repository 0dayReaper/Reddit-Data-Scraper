            "comment": "Honestly, Mimi is the highlight of this season. However, I think other members and the PDs deserve some praise too. I think Yujin have been consistent every episode ,and Eunji and Youngji have their moment that should not be ignored as well. They all honestly did well and their chemistry is just getting better and better. We serious need to have another music quiz because last time they were all tired so we need another game for them to dance with full energy and I am still waiting for a morning mission",

I've never been on a sleeper car but this looked straight out of *Murder on the Orient Express*. Santa's Village and the hotel rooms were also interesting but it's a shame they didn't get to see the Aurora--unless they are saving that for the final episode.\n\nAs others mention, Mimi was hilarious during the OST game. She reminded me of Mijoo on *Idol Dictation* just giving away answers during the snack round. You come off foolish but you get the most--and the best--screen time.\n\nHow did they not stick the fastest camera man to Yujin after last season? Or did her camera man and Torong switch this season so Torong could run away faster? I like the idea of multiple Torongs now so the other girls have a chance to catch him too. It was also funny the staff brought the girls out to sled and play in the snow under the guise of healing/play time, but really they just wanted to tire them out before the Torong chase began.",

Admittedly, I haven't seen the dramas, except Descendants of the Sun, but I didn't guess its OST, either. And the \"cause you are my girl\" edit had me dying. I've seen it so many times, but had no idea what the drama was. But I'm glad they got to eat a lot this time, the wins were well balanced.\n\nI hope we get to see some additional footage of the morning/evening in the igloo, did they see the aurora?\n\nFriends of mine went to the Santa village in January and actually waved at us on the live camera, so I was so happy when Yujin decided to search for it. She's the MVP when it comes to chasing and finding Torong. They should really hire some faster cameramen, though, no one can keep up with her. The cartoon sounds as she sped past everyone had me wheezing. \ud83d\ude02\n\nNext week's preview already looks chaotic with the 80s/90s/00s/10s idols dress-up.",

Having lived in a metropolis that experiences harsh winters, winter is mostly misery in a big city. \n\nThe train ride, Santa Clause village, and the camp they stayed in this episode were amazing though. Finland is a beautiful winter country outside of Helsinki for sure.\n\nI really liked the Torong chase concept this season. The members actually had to work to catch Torong (and clones) this time. Freaking Yujin caught Torong last season while basically lightly jogging because the motorcycle the rabbit rode malfunctioned or something lol.",

Also, NaPD and PHY PD explained they messed up a lot of the scheduling/timing of games: when the cast had high energy, they didn't have much ready, and they played the quiz too soon after the zombie game (which tired them out a lot - which you can obviously see in the quiz in Ep4, where even YoungJi is barely dancing), and then the seafood restaurant was also after the cast spent the hours before walking around the snowy city.\n\nThey didn't do Morning Mission because everyone - cast and staff - were all very tired from the travelling: up very early to catch a 14hr flight, arrive at night, probably stayed in a hotel in the city the first night, filming from next morning, then hours long bus ride to suburb lodgings, then having to set up, etc.\n\nAlso, the yut game took 3 hours - pretty sure literally everyone, including us watchers, were drained after that. (Fun fact: PHY PD said it was the most difficult thing he has ever had to edit).\n\n[Source - Eunji and Yujin S02E04 live watch. **Light spoilers** for Bali episodes - nothing major and nothing about the content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7itau1px_c)",

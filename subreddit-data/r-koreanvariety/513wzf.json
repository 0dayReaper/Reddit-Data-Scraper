    "postText": "[](#pb-mudo)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Me and /u/IClurker** have compiled a list of all the episodes of Infinite Challenge. The list has links to the raw video for all episodes, and to the subtitles where available.\n\nalso a big thanks to bintoro on dddfanclub for having a lot of episodes that were no longer found online, and to /u/nosedive for having softsubs that were unbeknownst to me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##Regarding the list\nIn cases where the subtitles were still available online on the subber's site, we have linked the source. In cases where the subs were no longer found online, the files have been re-hosted.\n\nThe \"subbed by\" column gives credit to the ones that have subbed the videos, with link-backs where applicable. There are a couple of episodes where we are not certain who have subbed the episodes. If you know who have subbed these episodes, or see wrongful information, please let us know.\n\nSome of the subber's websites and blogs have gone offline over the years, including Anyhow-subs which disappeared very recently. If you are a big fan of the show, especially if you think you'll be rewatching old episodes in the future, we suggest you store the episodes for safekeeping.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##The List\n\nThe list is hosted by this subreddit's wiki. You can find the list here\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#####**[Infinite Challenge E001 - E500 (Masterlist)](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/wiki/mudo_list)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**If you use the MEGA links, make a free account and import the files to your cloud before downloading.** Else, the traffic limit may eventually be exceeded, meaning files will inaccessible for a while.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n^(if the link for raw files is slow, google '\ubb34\ud55c\ub3c4\uc804 [YEAR] torrent' to find a different one.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##Missing episodes\n\nThere were some episodes we know have been subbed, but were unable to find. These are:\n\n* ~~E68~~ (thanks to /u/alexqq)\n* ~~E71~~ (thanks to /u/VanillaEclair)\n* ~~E76~~ (thanks to /u/VanillaEclair)\n* ~~E79~~ (thanks to /u/VanillaEclair)\n* ~~E111~~ (thanks to /u/cloudyday1)\n* ~~E268~~ (thanks to /u/sibtoa)\n* ~~E342~~ (thanks to /u/sabahan)\n\nI think we found them all now. If you have any subbed episodes that is not on the list, let us know!\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI guess that's it. Enjoy watching!",

This list would definitely make it easier to watch those episodes!\n\nThank you to the subbers, to those who kept the episodes and subs and to those who worked hard in making this compilation. \n\nIC is my most favourite variety show and I hope that we won't ever lose these subs and that one day, we can have English subs for every single episode.",

                    "comment": "Mainly because the whole show is a pain in the arse to translate, edit, typeset etc.\n\nEach episode is about 2000 lines of translated text, something like 50,000 words and it takes about 3 hours per every 10 mins of video to fully translate,typeset,edit etc.\n\nIn comparison, even a longish (2 hour) movie is like 900 lines of text. A typical anime episode (20mins) is 300 lines.\n\nThis also doesn't take into account how non-linear conversations are on a variety show, especially on Infinity Challenge. Members butt in all the time, lines will be slurred, some lines are just horrible puns that make no sense (I'm looking at you Myung Soo) and some just drag their lines out (Jae Suk in particular)\n\nThere is also a massive lack of Korean fan translators around lately, especially with the rise of official subtitles. Even if there was, there isn't going to be a lot of translators even among that extremely small pool that would be interested or experienced enough to even want to attempt Infinity Challenge translation.\n\nOh, have I also mentioned how you can't really translate random episodes? Infinity Challenge happens in very large joke \"arcs\" where jokes, characters, puns carry over the course of 10~20 episodes. If you start in the middle of one of those arcs, half the jokes are going to make absolutely no sense.\n\nSource - I spent too many years and hours swearing at Jae Suk for making my life hard",

I'm pretty shit at math so I'm just trying to pass. Pls chime in if you've taken any of these. \n\n* Math 52, 53, 104, 108, 109 , 113; \n* CS 205L\n* CME 100 \n* ENGR 108 (aka CME 103 or EE 103).",

Are you interested in CS to do computer graphics, cryptography, computer security,...?  Consider talking to faculty in the CS department to find out which math courses they think you would be well-served by taking.",

If not, props to you for having the work ethic/perseverance to toil in your field without the passion. If so, I think it's safe to say that being disillusioned about your field and trying to make money from your expertise is different than pursuing a field because it is known to pay well.",

A big part of that is due to the really chill culture in my lab which I see as more important than what I\u2019m specifically working on. Very few /almost no one, except for some academics, do work related to their PhD post grad, so the topic itself has very little relevance. Tbh I could see myself in any field, the only reason I ended up in the field I\u2019m in is because that\u2019s what I did for undergrad. My field doesn\u2019t pay as well as CS, but the degree opens the opportunity to go into quant finance or some other field that does. I\u2019m not smart enough for that, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing consulting.\n\nNot sure why you\u2019re getting downvoted, those are important questions people should ask to realize phd isn\u2019t always what it\u2019s sold to be",

            "comment": "I would imagine most people studying CS at Stanford are well-aware that it pays well. I'm not sure for how many people it's the **only** motivator, but I would imagine it's a very significant and large motivator. Personally, I appreciate the income-generating potential, but I also think that, even for people who are \"in it for the money\", there are other nice things about CS versus other high-earning degrees/professions (i.e., law, medicine, finance):\n\n* **Potential for work-life balance**: if you end up working in large tech companies, they will often pay as well or better than other high-earning professions, but with significantly less workload. \n* **Potentially higher-recognizable work:** It's easier to say you contributed building the software behind to some popular consumer app (i.e., YouTube) and have laypeople grasp it versus sharing the details of your work as a lawyer.\n* **Possibly earnings ceiling:** Many higher-paying professions are fairly stable, with a high floor and high ceiling. However, CS people are sold stories, myths and fantasies about being a startup entrepreneur who earns billions. Outside of specializations within finance (i.e., hedge fund managers), I don't think other similar high-paying jobs have such a high ceiling.\n* **(Decently) High social status:** Definitely not universally true, but I think \"nerds\" or \"tech-types\" enjoy much higher social status amongst laypeople. A concrete example of this would be parental approval, which can help while dating (i.e., \"Oh they're an engineer? Well they must be smart and hardworking then.\").\n\nI also know of immigrants who are doing CS also in-part because they want a secure path to US Citizenship, and studying something that has a clear career path with the possibility for employer visa sponsorship is a strong motivator. They could be studying something they're more passionate about (such as history or literature), but it could significantly diminish their chances of being able to stay long-term in the US.",

Unlike Law or Medicine, programming jobs abroad don't necessarily have super strict local language requirements. If you've the right chops and experience, you can easily find a programming job across Europe/CANZUK (and even across Asia/Latin America) if you *only* speak English. \n\nJust be prepared to take a big pay cut though.",

Contrast that with tech, where people make 200-250k as a starting salary at FAANG, or up to 600k in quant dev, with significantly less stress than IB.\n\nNot to generalize, but generally I've found that the people who go into IB are either very well connected through their parents (and thus wouldn't have to work 60-80hr weeks to advance) or don't have the skills to do technical work in other disciplines, and are fine grinding under the insane wlb for years.",

If I want to save as much space as possible to take econ/cs courses later down the road and also want to start with an easier course load - which would be better? Also which option is \"harder\" and more writing-intensive? Thanks so much! Any help would be appreciated!",

Also does doing ESF give me space for any extra courses in winter or spring quarter as opposed to just COLLEGE? If so can I use that space to take econ/cs courses early? Thanks so much for your help!!",

There's some variation with the COLLEGE component of ESF, and from what I've heard, some classes can be time-consuming in this aspect and others (like ESF 17, which was what I took) were light and only required us to do the readings and deliver a presentation in the quarter. \n\nCompared to taking PWR+COLLEGE in the fall, you get to save a few hours every week. It doesn't sound like a lot, but because you're adjusting to college, you'll be very thankful that you get to spend these hours talking to friends and getting used to campus life. Speaking in terms of units, taking ESF is the equivalent to taking PWR and COLLEGE, so I can't say that you'll be able to take *more* courses. Though, you'll get to knock a lot of your first-year requirements out of the way in the fall, which means that you can take courses you're interested in during the winter/spring!",

It\u2019s an even better option now because of how much they\u2019ve dumbed down COLLEGE courses: they axed a lot of the interesting classes available before, and now most of the classes are overly broad and of little educational value.",

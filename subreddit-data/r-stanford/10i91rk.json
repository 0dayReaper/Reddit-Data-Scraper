I only ask this because every single stanford ms student I run into had either a 3.95+ or went to Stanford for their BS.",

I think you\u2019re seeing a high \u201caverage\u201d because the people willing to share their GPA (or rather, are eager to) are those who have done well. Your sample set is biased by self-selection. And just my two cents, but the difference between a 3.7 and a 4.0 in STEM degrees is usually how well someone did in gen eds, which, IMO, is not a big factor in grad admissions. At least, that\u2019s what prevented me from getting that coveted 4.0 (because my major GPA was a 4.0)",

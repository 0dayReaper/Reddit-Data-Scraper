    "postText": "I am planning on taking CS 221 next quarter without taking CS 109 beforehand as a SCPD student. I took a probability course as an undergrad and got an A, but I am not sure if my professor was rigorous or not. Thus, I am a little worried about not taking CS 109 before taking CS 221.\n\nHow much CS 109 material is needed for CS 221, and what does that material include? Also, are there any resources available for me to review CS 109 material needed for CS 221?\n\nThanks in advance for the help!",

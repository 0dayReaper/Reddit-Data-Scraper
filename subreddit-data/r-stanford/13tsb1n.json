    "postText": "I am applying for graduate housing, and they said that I wasn't able to be placed into housing for the first round. From what I've gathered online, it seems that the chances of getting placed into on-campus housing through the second-round draw are very slim.\n\nIs there anything I can do to improve my chances of getting on-campus housing? I technically can get OAE-accommodated for certain things (didn't think I would need to since graduate housing is all singles). Would it be possible to withdraw from the graduate lottery and apply through the undergraduate lottery (though I would've graduated by then) to receive on-campus housing? Thanks.",

            "comment": "If your second round draw number is in the teens, you 99.99% won't get into Stanford housing. You cannot participate in the undergraduate lottery because the deadline for it has already passed (and if you still have undergraduate guaranteed housing left, why did you decide to do the graduate draw?). Best bet at this point is probably OAE, if that's a possibility.",

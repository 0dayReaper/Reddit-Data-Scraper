Similar to the way that poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses were aimed at harming black people through policies that were facially racially neutral but people understood them to be racist at the time they were enacted, the explicit goal of these policies was to use a facially religious-neutral standard that could discriminate against Jews in order to provide plausible deniability. This was well-understood both by the people applying these policies (as shown by uncovered internal memos) and by the public. In the linked article, it's pointed out that the aggregate effect of these policies having  resulted in questions from the public about anti-Jewish and anti-Catholic biases in admissions, which Stanford's administration felt important enough to deny by lying about it.\n\nI think you could make *some* comparisons to modern treatment of Asian applicants in admissions at elite universities, which is what I assume you're talking about with \"balancing merit with equity\", but today university administrators responsible for making decisions about admissions policy are pretty open about the motivations behind affirmative action policies and trying to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the student body. You're almost certainly not going to find some secret internal memo that makes the negative case, \"We have too many Asians. We need to stop accepting people from schools with Asians in them so that we can reduce the number of Asian students without having to directly consider race in our applications.\" So there are a lot of similarities, but it's not identical.",

Admissions sure has its golden Rolodexes to the elite feeder schools. \n\nFinally, has Stanford openly reflected on whether it bears any resemblance to the vision of the Stanfords to build a practical and pragmatic alternative to the Elite East coast schools.

Instead of solving the problem superficially, lets actually solve the inequality in the first place (rn a lot of people are complacent because they can point to higher college acceptance rates for minorities and move on like problem solved). In other words, the benefactors of AA are rich minority students, not those who actually need the help.",

For the almost three decades I've been on campus, Stanford has had about the same numbers of disadvantaged and affluent African-American admits, and I suspect at least recently that has been very much by design among technocrat Admissions and upper Administration managers using specific weighting criteria which are probably adjusted to achieve certain results, which are then impossible to call quotas because they are merely coefficients in some classification formulas.",

Creative talent is in all communities. A rational admissions policy would focus on getting amazing people to Stanford in all categories of amazing. I have little doubt that far greater and merit-based racial balance will be the result. And it requites more serious outreach. \n\nBut in the absence of serious outreach and enlightenment, we get skin color as a proxy? Please.

One of the most concise arguments I saw that summarized much of my opinion is this Atlantic article:[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-of-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-of-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/)\n\n&gt;The mother lode of all affirmative-action programs for the wealthy, of course, remains the private school. Only 2.2 percent of the nation\u2019s students graduate from nonsectarian private high schools, and yet these graduates account for 26 percent of students at Harvard and 28 percent of students at Princeton. The other affirmative-action programs, the kind aimed at diversifying the look of the student body, are no doubt well intended. But they are to some degree merely an extension of this system of wealth preservation. Their function, at least in part, is to indulge rich people in the belief that their college is open to all on the basis of merit.\n\nLike I mentioned in my other comment. We're all in the country club pretending we're fighting for the people.\n\nPersonally this is a very nuanced topic that i have very strong feelings in both directions, from both a race and a class perspective.",

Those applicants, many of whom were outstanding and amazing talent, were denied admission simply based on immutability of to whom they were born. The irony of apologizing for this past action while continuing the same practices (no matter how disguised) was nauseating to observe for its inconsistent application of principles.\n\nIf Stanford becomes 60% Asian one year and 25% the next under an exhaustive process to create an amazing class, then so be it.  But as it should have been for those Jewish kids in the 1950s and the Asian kids of the 80s-10s who were rejected simply because \"there were too many of them\" instead of by merit, Stanford needs to take a principled stand against categorical admissions and its racist evils.",

My advocacy is for all kids who do their utmost to squeeze what they can out of the opportunity given them. \n\nThe idea of racial advocacy is a disgusting thought and a product of past centuries. Moreover, it is a delusion. Most Americans three generations in have mixed parentage. Racial tribalism is not only an outdated farce, it is defined for obsolescence. \n\nThe two largest ethnic minorities in the US, African Americans and Latin Americans are highly mixed and have been for generations. Native Americans eschew efforts by authorities to define them by genetics rather than by cultural allegiance. Even Asian American families are increasingly blended.\n\nBut your question is interesting in what it implies: that advocacy for a wide definition of merit is somehow racial? Do you focus on process or outcome? Would you rather your race have increased representation regardless of merit? If so, do you not see that you open the door for other races to do the same, leading us to a race to the bottom or directly to the pursuit of $ into becoming USC?\n\nThe focus on outcomes implies a very narrow and stereotyped interpretation of what I wrote earlier. Brilliance comes from so many quarters it boggles the mind. Yet American undergraduate academic institutions, Stanford among them, are defined so narrowly that it calls into question what Stanford is trying to do and what it provides for $350K. \n\nI come from a different era. Stanford admissions under Dean Fred was about identifying the Stanford man and woman, finding that intangible quality, that spark within that manifested through the development of character. Everybody seemed to have a cool/noble/fantastic journey on the road to Stanford, tried their best to make the Stanford experience transformative, and then went on to live their lives. Is that what admissions are like today? Or is paint by numbers or in some cases admission by very big numbers along the lines of USC?\n\nIn a focus on outcome, race should be a random walk. when it narrows to within a tight range across the elite universities, it is a red flag that admissions are being steered toward acceptable racial outcomes. Bleh.   \n\nBut in the end it is an empirical question, no? the admission staff are assigned territory. For example, whomever is assigned to the Bay Area? With which schools do they regularly seek conversations?  Since Stanford can easily satisfy all kinds of quotas simply by looking only at the wealthiest public and private schools, why bother with the middle of  American students across the country?\n\nI am being presumptuous because I am not in the trenches and do not know what  the latest philosophy on admissions is. However, from what I have observed anecdotally about Stanford and the elite schools in the East is what admissions have given up on seeking talent in all quarters have instead enabled a parental arms race, willingly and perhaps intentionally. And that, compadre, is a crying shame.",

Is that what admissions are like today?\n\nNot at all. Personalities are quantified according to coarse-grained rubrics, and it's all data-driven. This is sterile and impersonal in comparison, but it does tend to eliminate a lot of unconscious bias, and they have firm statistical proof of that. But at what cost, I do not know.\n\n&gt; or in some cases admission by very big numbers along the lines of USC?\n\nThe recent collection of bribe-takers were apparently all acting individually and only very loosely coupled to the admissions administration.\n\n&gt; In a focus on outcome, race should be a random walk. when it narrows to within a tight range across the elite universities, it is a red flag that admissions are being steered toward acceptable racial outcomes.\n\nI think I may understand what you are trying to say here, but could you please clarify and expand on that?\n\n&gt; the admission staff are assigned territory.\n\nThese days that's all about arranging interviews. The acceptance rate is so low, the only recruiting is done by Athletics, as far as I know. I would love to be wrong about this, but I just don't think recruiting happens for academics outside of a few very isolated and high-profile instances, and not every year. How can we see behind the scenes on this? There must be a mention in a report somewhere.\n\n&gt;  I am not in the trenches and do not know what the latest philosophy on admissions is.\n\nI can't claim any special insights beyond just reading staff announcements and summaries now and then, and helping out prospectives. I did get something of an inside look when my daughter was comparing Harvard and Stanford just before the pandemic, but that was brief and probably already obsolete because of the pandemic.\n\n&gt; admissions have given up on seeking talent in all quarters have instead enabled a parental arms race, willingly and perhaps intentionally.\n\nI wouldn't go that far. The technocrats are still firmly in charge at every stage, applying data science formulae to try to achieve a careful but completely opaque (to almost all) balance between equity and merit. The public has no way to measure their success on such criteria, let alone the quality of overall outcomes. Except, perhaps most importantly, Stanford has become more elitist and exclusive, and is substantially contributing to the sharp increases in inequality so prominent recently. That is certainly a terrible shame.",

If that were the case, then athletic and legacy admissions would not be a thing. \n\nIf anything, todays wholistic admissions process creates so much information asymmetry and opportunity asymmetry that it\u2019s all but impossible for low social economic class students to enter. The few who do are lauded as examples of a \u201cjust\u201d system, when it is hardly just (I\u2019m not talking about AA in this case). \n\nIMO affirmative action is a philosophical distraction that ultimately hides the fact that wholistic private school admissions is largely a tool for wealth preservation. (Hey look, we have a large underrepresented minority population, but please don\u2019t look behind the curtains). They have consistently under delivered on their promise of social mobility for their student body compared to much less well resourced schools by most measurable metrics. \n\nIronically UCs and Cal State Universities have larger impact on social mobility than ANY private institution by most measures https://www.socialmobilityindex.org",

Legacy and athletics admits are limited to a certain proportion, not by any explicit quotas, but by adjustment of formula coefficients to keep the quantities involved at the internally politically acceptable levels given the opinions of the leadership and what they believe to be the external political climate.\n\nYou won't get any argument from me that the resulting system has terrible social mobility outcomes, and is actively making inequality worse. Top Administration officials readily admit to this in their public comments, and say they're not sure about how to fix it.\n\nI believe it is fixable, but not within the current internal political climate. If 2/3rds of minority applicants were disadvantaged instead of affluent, for example, that would just be too unpalatable for the hegemony who've kept it closer to 50-50 for several decades.",

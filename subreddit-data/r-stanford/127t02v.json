Also, upperclassmen will always find a way to complain about prospective freshman and forget that they were once visiting campus with wide-eyes too. \n\nJust be yourself, enjoy the beautiful campus, and meet your potential classmates :)",

My last school district was incredibly disadvantaged and no one cared enough to try because they all felt like failure was inevitable. I\u2019m so excited to dig myself out and join enthusiastic people, but I also want to avoid being abrasive. I hope we\u2019ll say hi someday :)",

I was diagnosed when I was 8 so I had a good amount of practice counting carbs and don\u2019t usually go looking for nutrition labels unless they\u2019re right in front of me (I could probably be better about this).\n\nI also found walking/biking around for classes helped keep sugars in check most of the time. If you end up at Stanford (highly recommend) I\u2019d advise getting in touch with OAE (office of accessible education). They might be able to help you get access to nutrition info and such.\n\nLow carb I found reasonably doable\u2014the harder thing was eating gluten free (I have celiac). They usually had grilled chicken or something at lunch and there\u2019s a salad bar so I was never totally screwed.",

I now know 3 people who have commit suicide this year because of depression and other symptoms, a direct result of the pandemic. And I know people have different opinions on COVID but the deep-rooted long lasting effects on our students and children are going to hit us real hard in the next several decades.\n\nDon't really know why I wanted to write this but if anything just hope you guys have a great 2021.\n\n(PS: $GME \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udffd Buy and Hold)",

(As in, Stanford is still losing money for every single student studying here -- I remember seeing somewhere that the cost per student per year at Stanford if they did not subsidize tuition would be in the 6 figures, which is much higher than the bill faced by students without financial aid anyway). So it's not like they're turning any profit by keeping tuition high; all they can do is minimize losses in an economically uncertain time.\n\nAs for international students, my understanding is that those who received financial aid for room &amp; board continue to receive financial aid for it, and those who are paying full fees are clearly rich enough that they're staying on campus by choice and not out of necessity.",

Lowering tuition would be an admission that the education students are getting during the pandemic is not as good as what they would have received otherwise. Whether that is true or not, they don't want to admit it because it could be something held against students (oh they didn't REALLY go to X school because they got the cheap online version) and therefore held against the school BY those students (I was promised the X institution experience and you're not giving it to me). It doesn't matter that the MAJORITY of people would not think those things, they're not willing to go on the record (especially by quantifying the lower value) out of fear of weirdos holding it against them.",

You can see that in their total budget for 2018, \"Student Income\" (so Tuition + Room &amp; Board) was only 15% of their total revenue (and covers just 16% of their total yearly expenditures -- Stanford would be bankrupt in a few years if student income was their main source of revenue). Now, since this year is completely atypical, and their revenue stream is severely damaged (Significantly less room &amp; board payments, barely any investment income especially back in March, severe reductions in Alumni donations etc.) while their expenditures are almost exactly the same (check the Budget Book to see the nature of their expenditures -- you'll see that their highest spending categories, such as Faculty Compensation, Financial Aid, Graduate Student Stipends, Operations &amp; Maintainance, capital &amp; depreciation etc. are all things that remain consistent fees regardless of the pandemic), I find it pretty difficult to demand that they reduce their tuition. Doubly so because the people who would benefit the most from a tuition reduction -- the people paying full tuition -- are the people who are hurt the least by the pandemic as it is.\n\nI also believe Persis (or MTL, I can't recall) echoed the line of reasoning I gave in the above comment in one of their weekly emails earlier in the pandemic.",

I don't know enough about the Stanford investment portfolio to say (and they don't release much details to the public). I do know though that their overall investment ethos is pretty conservative, and so speculative plays like shorting was probably a minor portion of the portfolio, if it exists at all. They seemed much more slanted towards asset classes with a clear upwards trajectory in the short-medium term, like natural resources, real estates, and index funds. \n\nI do also know that Stanford did project a 200 million loss this year back in March. So for one I doubt they had the spare cash to invest in the stock market back then (and no one really knew back then if we were heading towards a recession or not -- tbh I even feel like the current bull market is unsustainable in the short-medium term and we'll crash pretty soon). Secondly, I also doubt they had enough cash on hand to navigate the deficit, so if they were forced to liquidate parts of their investment back then to cover the shortfall, then even though the stock market has recovered their overall investment portfolio would have definitely tanked somewhat. Given that MTL said our budget would be constrained for the coming years, I'm willing to bet that they probably did liquidate some of their assets, and we can't bank on them siphoning as much of their investment income to supplement operating expenses for the next few years.

I have to tell profs all the time - don't blame your bad teaching on distance learning. \n\nThat said, learning - online or in-person - cannot happen when students (and faculty/administrators) aren't supported. One of the biggest lessons on instructional pedagogy I've seen during this pandemic is simply remembering to be flexible and, well, human. People are struggling, people are tired, and we're all supposed to be in this together. \n\nIt's sad how so many \"top tier\" schools haven't learned that, and how so many of them seem to be trying to force their pre-made solutions into such a unique situation.",

Be that classes or outdoor events or students in pods.\n\nThey did actually try to start in-person outdoor classes with the GSB students, and the law school was headed that way at the end of last quarter. Obviously that's off the table for now, but senior leadership was hell-bent on trying to make things as normal as possible.\n\nFrom the student side, I think it's really hard to imagine just how incredibly alone people here are. Even in the grad side, where most people have been here for a number of years and they have friends and have lived alone/mostly alone for awhile, many, many people have moved away. The only grad housing units in short supply right now are for couples (who have a built-in buddy and also would have a harder time going \"home\").\n\nThe pandemic doesn't feel very real for a lot of people and it's a struggle to know how to respond to it. Students have been working more or less their entire lives for the moment they get to \"go\" to college. It's got to be incredibly hard to put that on hold. But life on campus right now is not what people hope it would be, and if they try to make it like the want, they're risking their lives and everyone else's.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am a sophomore undecided between majorining in SymSys, Design (AI + Digital track), and MS&amp;E. I intended to declare Product Design in winter but since the major was dissolved in fall, they removed it from being declarable (even if I matriculated when the major was still active). I pivoted to MS&amp;E but had a really bad experience with a class this quarter/made me reflect and think about this more.\n\nI'm interested in product management, UI/UX design, etc. so a mix of quantitative and qualitative skills. I am interested in the MS&amp;E and SymSys coterms, but I am unsure how hard they are to get into and am not sure if I should choose my undergrad major with a coterm in mind. I also haven't thought too much about other post-grad options besides working or a coterm, so would love to hear experiences on that. \n\nI would love to hear anyone's experiences with these majors/coterms, as well as what careers you are interested in/have gone into. As a FLI student, I am concerned about the financial stability of the major I choose (although I know a lot has to do with work experience). \n\nThank you!",

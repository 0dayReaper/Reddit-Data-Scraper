It was quite convenient; they would drive to you much like an uber then direct you along various areas with specific driving conditions. They're open to also tailor the route to whatever you want to practice such as highway or urban driving (or local neighborhood driving for 30 minutes if you're initially a coward like I was). The instructors I got were all nice and friendly, and as someone who had never driven before either, three lessons with minimal external practice were sufficient to pass my driver's test.\n\nIf you do behind-the-wheel lessons you can use my referral code to save $20 lol  \nGGUKPK0NJ2 \n\nAnyways, don't want to sound too much like a shill but they worked well in my case.",

    "postText": "I have a job offer to work at the university but I am unsure if I should take it. Its a regular job in their IT department. It would require me to relocate from where I am now. The problem is the salary doesnt really cover the difference in cost of living in the bay area, compared to where I am now. It would ultimately be a decrease in salary overall (30% or so) compared to the salary I have now when I factor in cost of living. I have no problem with the bay area, I would love to work and live there. I am just not sure if its worth it. I am looking for a change from my current job but I am in no hurry. I am just curious on if there is people here that work at the university and have any comment on what it's like to work at the university. Are there any people here that had a similar situation as myself that did choose to take the job? How did it work out for you?",

I just had my performance review for the year and I will be getting promoted in January. I am able to max out my retirement savings, do roth ira, and save a little extra with the mega backdoor roth, which I have not had available at any of other jobs. \n\nIm thriving in this environment. The work I do is far more interesting. My boss has been encouraging me to sit in on classes for a while now, so this quarter I finally started doing it. My boss is ok with me using my STAP funds for continuing studies classes so I've taken a few of those. I do group fitness classes 3x a week. \n\nI definitely would not move here for a paycut long term unless you plan on using the job to spring board into something else in the bay area at a tech company since you'll be local and it will be easier to apply and interview.",

Depending on where you\u2019re at you could be union which could get tricky for raises and such. That said, negotiate. There is always an extra 5k and they don\u2019t expect you to take the first offer. \n\n\nAll that being said, if you want a career in IT/computers you\u2019ll be able to rub elbows with the best based on the location and pedigree /prestige-like at the supermarket or a bar. \n\n\nIt\u2019s truly a great place to work but you can only count on 1-2% raises each year and attraction /new hire budget is bigger than retention so ask for more. \n\n\nAdditionally, keep an eye out for the on-campus housing. There is staff housing that kept me golden-handcuffed for 5+ years. There is a new building that just opened in Redwood City and you get first dibs if you\u2019re working at that location. They are building another in Menlo Park and stanford west is pretty chill but very kid-focused. I\u2019d also try to negotiate that too depending on the level you\u2019re coming in at. \n\nIn sum, if you decide to take the job:\n\n1. Negotiate for more pay. This could look like additional things such as starting with more vacation, or an educational stipend on top of the $800 STAP funds, or getting on the management track/in the manager courses (your boss typically needs to sign off on those), etc. \n2. If they can\u2019t give you more pay ask for housing support. If they can put you in contact with specific locations and get on the list for them that would be stellar. I would even negotiate to say (if possible) since (on average) it takes a year or so to get off the waitlist (unless you\u2019re short listed) could you be remote the first year while you wait for the opportunity? Or maybe the first 6 months or something to help you build a nest egg to move? \n3. Winter closure- depending on when they want you to start you\u2019re probably going to get a huge chunk of time off anyway -if they are chill with it, maybe ask to be on campus in 2023. \n4. Choose your boss but keep in mind stanford can be fascinating and really propel you as a leader (if that\u2019s what you want and take advantage of what they have to offer). I had a string of terrible bosses (I don\u2019t hear this about IT so you should be fine) but I also had the support from the organization (as someone else said) to explore what interested me and be automatically connected to the best and brightest for informational interviews etc. \n5. If the pay, timeline, etc don\u2019t work. Ask for a hybrid position so you could live further away and not have to commute as much. \n6. Starting in January of 2023 you can ask for your compa ratio/salary band and where you sit and why . This will be a legal requirement - I mention it because it\u2019ll give you an idea of growth potential for the current position. \n\nSource: worked there for a very long time, in HR, specifically employee growth and development.",

It is a really nice town. I'm sure there are affordable rental options. The trend in the bay area is to rent out a room in a house share situation or find a studio/pool/guest house on someone's property. \n\nYou could also meet connected people at Stanford. Your attitude of \"I'm in no hurry\" feels like you will maybe not leave for a long time and have regrets when you finally do leave for not leaving earlier. My husband was in your position kind of. He left a high paying job and took on a greatly lower paying job to move closer to our ranch (he had a work week rental) and because he needed a change. It took him getting fed up to leave and when he did he realized he missed out on so much for staying too long at his prior job. I'd take the job. Rents are going down and there are neighboring commutable areas to live as an option. I think you will gain more that what you will lose by staying complacent.",

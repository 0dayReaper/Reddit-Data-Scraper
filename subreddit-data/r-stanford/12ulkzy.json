    "postText": "hi guys, I need genuine opinions on this major/minor/coterm lineup. I want to go into international economics or economic modelling, which ik barely exists lol, and if I can't do that then I want to be able to go into quant. \n\nRight now, I feel like MS&amp;E is the best option for that as it involves A LOT of modelling for economics and finance, and the international relations would be good for that policy/international lense. I am also thinking of a math minor or double major but idk if that is do-able or recommended since my current courses are not really math courses, which I really do want to have. \n\nI am also completely unsure about my coterm. I wanted to do MS&amp;E but I think that would be better for undergrad personally just because it would help me figure out what I actually want to do (CS/ECON/MATH) and I could specialize more in my masters. But for my career path (which is still pretty loose), does anyone have any advice for which coterm I should keep in mind? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks!",

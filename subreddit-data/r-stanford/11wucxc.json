    "postText": "Hi there!\n\nI got into the online master's program in computer science at Stanford for Fall of 2023 as a Canadian, and am wondering for anyone who was in the same position, if there were any scholarship opportunities or financial aid that I could apply for. I will be staying in Canada for its duration, and don;t know what financial sources I should be looking at. I plan to work during that time so I'm assuming that financial aid would be limited (totally understandable) and I also saw that Stanford's was limited to Americans. Just wondering how people in my position funded their master's if they didn't pay for it out of pocket. \n\nAny insight would help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso hoping not to get destroyed in the comments for asking this question. I'm happy with my work and I know this won't \"open up more doors\" or doing it online won't \"get me connections\" that I think you would normally go to this school for a master's for. I also know that there are cheaper Canadian schools, which is why I'm looking into funding sources to see if it's personally worth doing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

Most MS in CS programs that I've seen in the US don't offer scholarships or financial aid packages. \n\nInstead, the way of offsetting the cost seems to be frequently done through being a Course Assistant, Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant. You can find the public 2022-23 salary table for these positions here: [link](https://gfs.stanford.edu/salary/salary23/salary_tables.pdf).\n\nHowever, since you're doing this both online and part-time, I imagine it may be quite challenging for you to secure one of these positions; beyond that, it will involve more work (i.e., grading, office hours, answering student questions in an online forum) on top of your current full-time job, so it may not be fully worth it.",

Albeit a small sample size, but the few HCP students I know have some portion of tuition employer-subsidized.",

You are allowed to only take 3 units (basically, one class) per quarter\n2. You won't be allocated graduate housing\n3. You (may) not be able to CA/TA -- although I haven't seen this policy explicitly described anywhere after some searching.\n\nI think if your full-time job is quite demanding, then even taking 1 class per quarter may be challenging. In addition, a large part of the value of the experience is going to classes in person, meeting other students and faculty.\n\nI'm fortunate in that I have a job that allows me to be mostly remote, and I live reasonably close to Stanford so can commute to most classes, allowing me to be on campus for speaker events, meeting faculty, hanging out with my classmates etc.\n\nThus, I can work full-time and still be on-campus for one class a quarter. However, I suspect any more than that and I would be quite stressed out or have to significantly sacrifice in other areas (i.e., gym time, relationship with my spouse etc.).",

I finished a master's in mechanical engineering a few years ago thinking that my career would be all about that, but the problem is, I have a very niche specialty in engineering, and I lost my job a few months into the pandemic (I've survived plenty, but not all, of the waves of layoffs before covid though). Because of how unique my specialty is, finding my next job has always been exceptionally difficult, and after that recent layoff, I decided it was time to leave it behind and go into something else that I could do pretty much anywhere in the country. I think machine learning is badass, and I'd love to learn it well and be competitive for MLE roles (I don't think bootcamps will make me competitive as I need to be), plus I just love learning. I've had to do plenty of programming in my engineering career, but it was always just good enough to get the job done, rather than doing it properly (e.g. making it memory efficient, scalable, easily maintainable, etc). I think I'd really enjoy this graduate program, and I could definitely find ways to pay for it that don't destroy my finances (my employer would convert much but not all the costs). I'm on the east coast though. Would I even have a shot at getting into that program?",

There's no difference otherwise.\n\nThis means the acceptance rate is going to be likely the same for HCP vs. full-time. I've heard it floated around that the MS in CS at Stanford admissions rate is roughly \\~4%.\n\nAs for your particular chances, I'm not too sure.\n\nHowever, I'd recommend reading this guide on getting admitted to Stanford's MS in CS (and similar tier programs). It was written by someone who received his MS in CS in 2010, and also sat on the admissions committee and has first-hand knowledge of how these decisions are made: [https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rkarthik/DAGAP.pdf](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rkarthik/DAGAP.pdf)\n\nI think the advice there is quite sound, and also generally aligns with what I've heard and read about how the process works.\n\nThe most challenging aspect of your application may be that you're applying for a ML concentration. From my experience, many of my classmates in the MS in CS students at Stanford are also concentrating in the AI/ML field. Many of them, before applying, have done some form of research or had work experience in the field of ML. I myself published one paper in applied ML at a Tier 1 conference a few years before I applied.\n\nThus, you may be competing against folks who have fairly impressive backgrounds in ML. You may want to consider how you can improve your chances to be more competitive against other applicants.",

    "postText": "I'm trying to decide how I feel about this. My parents and I talked about it casually today and they didn't feel like it made sense for them to go to my graduation. They would have to fly literally across the country, potential book an expensive hotel, and all to watch me walk across a stage(?) field(?) I don't really know what graduation entails. My dad has health problems so flights suck for him. \n\nWhen we talked about it, I tried to stay casual and not influence their decision, because I don't want my dad to do something that's going to really suck for him and his health just because I asked. And that's the thing- if I asked, and said it was really important to me, I know they would do it. However, I feel weird telling them it's important to me after earlier seeming like it would be okay if they didn't go, and I also understand their perspective that all I'm doing is walking across grass. \n\nAt the same time, I feel really upset at the idea of no one coming to my graduation. I don't feel like I have a ton of friends on campus, and I know it's going to feel awful being so alone for what is supposed to be a celebration. Or I could just not go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this? Should I ask them to come? Should I go to graduation? If I do, what can I do to make it feel special and less sad? Anyone else doing graduation solo?",

I think OP needs to accept this and move past it and find other ways to celebrate graduation. \n\nSpend the day with a close friend and do all the picture taking, etc. with them. OP may even have a friend who's parents would be understanding of OPs situation and invite OP to celebrate with them? (e.g., \"hey mom and dad, my friend Confidenceissaid's parents are not able to be at graduation, do you think he/she can go to dinner with us?\"  if my kid asked me to do that I'd say yes! )\n\nWhen OP gets home do something special with family -- with the $ not spent on travel, OPs family could spend even a small portion of that on a nice dinner out.

            "comment": "I see two separate decisions here. \n\n     \n1) Should you go to graduation? I'd recommend Yes. Most people who attend really enjoy the celebratory atmosphere, and every friend I knew who could have attended but chose not to later said they regretted it. \n\n      \n2) Should your parents go to graduation? Now's the time to be honest with your parents, it's possible that they don't realize that this is a big deal for you. If your dad has health issues and that ultimately precludes your parents from coming, how about having them cheer you on when watching the livestream? That's what some of my family members with health issues did, it was very nice to know they could see me walk onto the field live even if they were bedridden far away.\n\n      \n\nBonus: underlying feelings of loneliness. It's absolutely valid to be alone and have alone time (we call it \"unhealthy codependence\" otherwise). It's also good to take a few minutes when you're alone and reflect on why you're feeling lonely, plus what you're going to do about it. You may feel like you don't \"have a ton of friends on campus\", but few do, and I'm certain your number's higher than zero. Send them a message, say hi to other people you recognize when you see them around, go to graduation events and meet people old and new, wave at someone when you walk into class. Think about what you want, and take small steps towards that future.",

If health issues prevent your dad from flying, that\u2019s one thing, but if you have a positive relationship with your parents and want them there, they should make the effort. In fact, I think it kind of stinks that they put you in this position at all.\n\nYes, graduations as ceremony are a bit much, but as someone who mid-Covid didn\u2019t celebrate getting my masters degree, I really regret it; you need to acknowledge all the hard work you\u2019ve put in! \n\nGood luck and good vibes!",

Maybe a small graduation party with family and close friends at home?). I can\u2019t imagine they aren\u2019t proud of you, but it sounds like there are competing concerns. I would, however, express that you will be sad that they are not there while expressing the equal understanding of the difficulties of travel for your family. You need to reignite the expectation that you had of this moment and that you imagined they would be there for this accomplishment. It\u2019s okay to acknowledge that it sucks that they can\u2019t be. Be honest and gentle and this doesn\u2019t have to be a cause for contention with your parents. Congratulations and good luck!",

Whatever you decide to attend or not to attend is a good decision for yourself. If there are friends that can adopt you for the day and celebrate with you, that would be wonderful. DM your address and I would love to send you a card. \n\nFor me, my parents didn't come to my high school or college graduation. Lots of reasons but it still hurt really bad on that day and for a long time afterwards. I didn't attend my college graduation and only went to the basics for high school. Friends really helped soften the blow but most were focused on their own family celebrations. \n\nI did end up going to grad school and that was a long process so I wanted them at my defense. I paid for plane tickets, hotels and rental car. It was fun to hang with my siblings. My parents were, lets call it, not grateful. \n\nI don't regret either decision. I hope this gives you some perspective.",

You\u2019re just sitting in a chair down in a field the whole time and there\u2019s your typical Stanford whacky costume shenanigans.  \n\nFrom there folks split off and head to their department graduations.

    "postText": "I got a smart dehumidifier for my dorm. It needs a 2.4 GHz, private network (it only lets me enter a password--no username, so edurome doesn't work).\n\nStanford and stanford visitor are both public networks with website logins, so those don't work either.\n\nIf I could connect to SUtilities that would probably work. I don't think there is a way to connect to the Stanford network.\n\nAnyone have a similar experience and figure it out or have any idea what to do? Is my \"smart\" device screwed?",

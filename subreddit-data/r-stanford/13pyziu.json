It\u2019s a very chill way to meet frosh in your dorm and talk through some of your feelings about transitioning to college.\n\nPlease don\u2019t worry about falling behind on units/prereqs during your first quarter at Stanford, there\u2019s so much going on and during your first quarter on campus it takes a lot of time to adjust to that.",

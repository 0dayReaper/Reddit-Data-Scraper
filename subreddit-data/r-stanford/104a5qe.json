    "postText": "Does anyone else find it super disappointing that meal blocks expire at the end of the year now? Additionally, they removed the 10-meal block option as well this year which I find to be really frustrating. I think it was ten anyway from last year, it might have been five. I swear RDE is out to get all the students by doing this, this is definitely a benefit to them in making money.",

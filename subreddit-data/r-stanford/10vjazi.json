    "postText": "I am currently in my final semester of undergraduate at a highly ranked physics institution. In the fall, after I had already submitted all of my applications, I messed up on a final and received a B- in a graduate level physics course I was taking as an undergraduate. Last week I was accepted to Stanford, but now I am worried about having the offer rescinded once I submit a final transcript. In the event I am not rescinded, another thing I am worried about is if this may have an effect on my ability to get research once I am on campus. I am unfamiliar with how the rotation based research applications work for first years, will I submit my undergraduate transcript for this?",

Remember that for grad school, grades are a very small part of the equation. I think it\u2019s easy for students, especially at a place like Stanford, to obsess over grades and perform less well on other aspects of their PhD.",

I got into top PhD programs in my field with 3 Bs in undergrad (including a B-), they're not going to care about a single grade like that.\n\n*Very* unlikely that it would affect your rotation process at all. PIs recruit students based on research interest/experience/fit, not based on their undergrad grades. If a PI would stop you from joining their lab because of a B-, they're not someone you would want to work for.",

Accepted for chemical engineering PhD at Stanford in early January, and consequently decided to chill for the winter and spring quarters of undergrad at a highly ranked public institution. Got more than a few B's here and there, never heard a thing from Stanford. Only thing that was effected was latin honors on my undergraduate degree\u2013ended up plain old cum laude as opposed to summa or magna. Currently in my first year of PhD studies here and loving it! Congratulations, you have achieved something amazing. Get excited for grad school :)",

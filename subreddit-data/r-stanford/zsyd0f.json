I can't drive, so commute is restraining a lot of options too. Just wondering if Stanford offers any affordable housing over the summer for even non-stanford students. Or if anybody might have a place they can rent out over the summer. If anybody is feeling charitable please hmu. I upkeep all the places well and am desparate.\ud83d\ude14",

    "postText": "so i'm a current frosh interested in neuro and i quickly realized that there's no neuro major at stanford. i was like well i'm just going to do humbio w/ a neuro core or symsys with a neuro core. however, i didn't really want to do the a/b side of humbio so i was like symsys here i come. \n\ni took symsys 1 and finished the course and was ready to go more into symsys until i got interested in neuro majors at other schools. i realized that they were taking physics and chem as a requirements and if i go to med school i would still need them. orrrr if i want to do a neuro phd i would need them either way.\n\ni was also thinking of doing bmc or bioe but I'm still thinking of neuro, so idk what to major in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsomeone help me :D",

I'm sure at least one of them (but probably more) will be happy to chat with you at their office hours and give advice regarding how you can get prepared for and involved in their field while at Stanford.",

            "comment": "An undergrad neuro degree does not really allow you to do much career wise and is really a path on the way to something else.  The reason neuro majors at other schools are taking physics and chem is that the most neuro majors are premeds, and physics and chem are required for med school.  I think that your path forward should really be dependent on whether you think you are interested in med school.  If you are, the easiest path that would be to go the hum bio neuro core route.  If you are not interested in med school, then you are looking at neuro research, grad school route in which case, either the hum bio or sym sys would be fine since either would allow you to apply to grad schools.  It really depends more on which aspect of neuro you want to focus on.  Either way, what you really are going to use during your career, you would be learning in med school/grad school.  You just have to do enough in udergrad to get you to that point.",

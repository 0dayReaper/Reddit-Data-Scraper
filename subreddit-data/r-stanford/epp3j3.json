    "postText": "Bring a water bottle--one of those 15L water cooler bottles.  Slam it on the floor as you walk in. Make sure to sit at the front. Bonus points if you can position yourself so that you get into the video recording.\n\nEverytime you feel a little thirsty, say \"excuse me,\" lift the bottle to your mouth with both arms, making sure to spill plenty of water over yourself and the floor every time you do, also, letting out a deep, loud, exhalation of satisfaction after every sip, then finishing the routine by slamming the bottle on the ground again before loudly saying, \"pfew, I needed that, I was getting a bit THIRSTY\" yelling thirsty as loud as I could.\n\nWhen lecture finishes, pick up the bottle in such a way that the remainder pours out as you leave.",

He would spend the entire class period on his computer browsing dank memes. It was a small upper division class of 20 people.  He was also late to every exam by at least 10 minutes but was always the first one to leave and got the highest grade in the class. Now that's how you establish dominance.",

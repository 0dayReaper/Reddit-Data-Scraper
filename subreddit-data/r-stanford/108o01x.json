However, never ever try to use these courses as an indication of any affiliation with Stanford. You will be seen in a very negative light by people with degrees from elite universities.",

Everybody knows they have zero value, but these goons act like they spent years of dedicated work to get it. \n\nMeanwhile, my buddy Siddhartha hasn\u2019t seen the sun in 6 months because his PhD advisor thinks quantum encryption will be viable in the next decade.",

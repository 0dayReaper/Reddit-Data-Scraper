    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI am looking to apply to the New grad residencies for fall, I was wondering how competitive it is, How I can stand out more, or just general advice!\n\nI have 9 years of experience as a Navy Corpsman in the ICU (adult and peds), and I am a current Nurse Extern in the ICU.   \n\nMy dream overall is Peds ICU, but willing to apply to both hospitals to better my chances of getting a position.\n\nThanks in advance for all your help :)",

Also when answering the application questions- just answer them, do not try to get fancy, just answer the questions clearly.\n\nAfter the initial screening, you would attend a panel interview. Keep your responses to under 2 mins in length and get to the point without rambling. \n\nIt is quite competitive, over 1000 will apply and 100 will get a job.",

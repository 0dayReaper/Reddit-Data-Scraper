Please drop me some tips.. Heard that people in Green library always talk about their new product ideas and funding..",

In their place you have a gaggle of high school and junior high kids who have taken over campus for summer programs. \n\nWould say it's not worth it unless you have some kind of \"in\". For example, working with a prof in their lab for the summer. Or if you go in already knowing someone working on a startup. The trouble is, a lot of these relationships are formed during the rest of the year. I'd say it's tough but not impossible during the summer. Don't come to campus hoping to figure something out when you get there, but work something out before you go.",

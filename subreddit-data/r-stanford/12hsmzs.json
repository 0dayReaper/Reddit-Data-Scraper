    "postText": "I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity to attend both schools, but am just conflicted about which is the best option. (hoping to go into finance/business-related fields after college). Based on the info below, I'd love some advice from former/current students at either school! Thanks sm!\n\n**Basic info:** same cost to attend both, same distance from home, I like both snow and year-round sun so weather isn't a huge factor.\n\n**Career**: I know for certain (90%ish) I want to work in business after graduating, however, that could range from venture capital to investment banking to consulting. I understand Penn is more heavily recruited for these fields, but I've also heard that a Stanford STEM degree paired with econ is more desired than a Wharton undergrad degree. I'll also note that I have no preference for either super techy finance or traditional East Coast finance, they both appeal equally to me.\n\n**Academics**: I've heard that Stanford has pretty high-grade inflation, whereas Wharton has some grade deflation. I don't want a 4.0 or anything, but I'd like to have a decent amount of time reserved to do other stuff besides studying. However, at Stanford, I'd like to coterm econ with either CS or MS&amp;E, and am worried whether that would be excessively rigorous for someone with minimal coding experience. I was also curious whether the coterm and the extra work it brings with it is worth it in comparison to just a Wharton degree with a concentration in finance and OID/stats.\n\n**Student life**: I love the idea of having a tight-knit dorm community (like the house system at Notre Dame or Harvard), but I'm not sure if either school offers this. I also am not a huge party person, and prefer going out with a smaller group. In terms of student life that I'd engage in, I'm a huge fan of basketball and football, and I know Stanford sports are much better. As for the overall East vs. West coast culture, I'd probably struggle/enjoy both equally since I'm from the South.\n\n**Major questions:**\n\n**If I want to go into finance, is a Wharton or Stanford degree better? Also do Investment banks and MBB consulting recruit at Stanford (or would I have to cold email a lot)?**\n\n**Is doing a coterm in CS/MS&amp;E at Stanford going to be extremely rigorous? Is the Masters I could receive worth the extra work in comparison to a double major at either Stanford or Wharton?**\n\n**Based on your experiences, which school has a better student life/cultrue overall?**\n\nSorry for the long post, I'm just conflicted between my choices lol. Thanks sm! Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!",

Any help regarding the companies that do/don't recruit from Stanford would be greatly appreciated!

Why grind out 100 hour weeks making 200k when you can work 40 and clear 200 first year at FAANG as an L3 and 300k at quant firms?",

Unless you're a quant, most of your work isn't that quantitative. It's much more about sales, presentation, etc etc. Full disclosure, I didn't go the MBB or IBanking route, I do product in tech.

If your genuinely unsure then take stanford no question, the optionality compared to wharton is significant. That said if your set on the 2+2+mba &gt; greatness path, or think that anyone that doesn't work at [insert mf/umm pe shop] is an unprestigous scumbag - go to wharton. It's marginally worse for buyside recruting but blows stanford out of the water for ib recruiting. \n\nAll that said, if you go to stanford you can grind technicals with me (just got admitted lol)",

After graduating you could more easily go into like international corporate management which seems much more interesting than traditional finance grind - at least to me. Congrats on both - they\u2019re both incredible options and you can\u2019t go wrong\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udf32",

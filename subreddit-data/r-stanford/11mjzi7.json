    "postText": "I'm at a crossroads right now and I have no idea whether I want to continue my cs education and get a masters in cs or go to law school and practice either corporate/tech/finance law. This program seems like the perfect opportunity to get more exposure to both and hopefully help me decide what I want to do with my life. Does anyone have any insight to what it's like to get this joint degree? Since you are getting both did you ever feel like you were getting an insufficient education in one or the other? If I want to focus on AI/ML with my cs portion am I able to do that or is it a much more strict curriculum?",

            "comment": "Current MS in CS student here.\n\nFrom the [website](https://cs.stanford.edu/academics/joint-degree-programs/joint-cs-mslaw-degree), it looks like the JD/MS dual degree asks you to satisfy the full requirements of both degrees. I'm not sure you get anything special by doing the specific dual degree program (outside of being able to apply coursework to both degrees). \n\nSo I think you may want to get insight from JD students/alum or MS CS students/alum about their respective programs, and you will probably get a fairly good idea of what it may look like in conjunction.\n\nVery briefly, now having been in the MS in CS program for a while, I will say that the AI/ML concentration for the MS in CS program at Stanford is quite strong in terms of professor quality and instruction. Stanford has some of the world's leading AI/ML researchers, and many of them are also incredible lecturers/teachers.\n\nI can't comment on the quality of teaching for JD courses, though.",

            "comment": "I'm an attorney and went to Stanford for undergrad. \n\nI would strongly recommend against the JD/MS in Computer Science program if your intent is to figure out what you want to do with your life. Three issues here. First, law degrees are extremely expensive, and the easiest way to pay them off is either working in a large law firm (we call it \"biglaw\") or doing ten years of public service and having your loans forgiven through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Second, there's a real opportunity cost to going to law school, which takes three years. In three years you can potentially save enough money to purchase your first vehicle or even make a down-payment on a house, depending on where you live and how much you earn (less realistic in the Bay Area, I know). Finally, once you get a law degree and the financial obligations that come with it, you will no longer have the flexibility to do things like take a year off and live in a foreign country, or even pursue certain career tracks that don't pay as well. If you feel like you need to explore more to know what you want to do, take advantage of your relative freedom and just explore outside of the structure of formal education. \n\nI say all of this as someone who is very satisfied with my legal career. Law was the right decision for me, but I would probably have regretted it if I'd gone to law school earlier than I did (I entered law school three years after I graduated from Stanford). And even today I'm keenly aware that I've closed off certain opportunities to myself. It's only because I took the time to make the right decision for me that I'm okay with not being able to pursue those other routes.",

To answer your questions:\n&gt; Does anyone have any insight to what it's like to get this joint degree?\n\nYes--please feel free to DM me, I'd be happy to chat if you are still looking for perspective. \n&gt; Since you are getting both did you ever feel like you were getting an insufficient education in one or the other?\n\nI felt like I got a rigorous education with freedom to pursue my interests. You'd spend the first year at the law school taking basically all law classes; after that it's up to you (many garden-variety law students take two years of law courses and start to branch out in their third year, e.g. to business, design, etc. even if they aren't joint degree students). \n&gt; If I want to focus on AI/ML with my cs portion am I able to do that or is it a much more strict curriculum?\n\nJD/MSCS students end up in the Law/CS concentration in the CS department. I'd grab the current program sheet to get an idea of exactly what you'd need to take, but I didn't find it stopped me from taking the courses I was interested in (mainly security, AI, and NLP).",

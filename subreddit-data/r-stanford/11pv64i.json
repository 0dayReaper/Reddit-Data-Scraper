It is so bad that I can never have a proper Zoom lesson in my room and will never feel confident if I have to attend an online job interview. For a school that prides itself on tech, this is mad. Wonder why nothing has been done to fix this",

Whatever the reason, it is totally absurd.  Like with other incompetence such as the badly-run OAE and the refusal to do anything about the inadequate amount of classroom space while it plans for increasing the student body by 25% some day. \n\nIf a lot of parents of students would send the President and Provost and endless number  of deans and associate vice-provosts of whatever with emails castigating them for allowing such a situation to persist despite the high tuition &amp; housing fees, maybe something could happen.  Eventually.  Or maybe not...",

We have put a lot of effort (and money) into improvements in recent years and I was really pleased when I student said that our Wi-Fi is better than what she has at home.\n\nWhen I was a Stanford student, our US News ranking dropped from #1 to #6 because of a change in the metrics. Before the change, the president at the time said, \"they're just rankings, it's no big deal\" and after the change \"they're just rankings, it's no big deal\". Meanwhile, our college has *banners* all over campus advertising our rankings.\n\nOne of our professors who got her PhD at Stanford told me her experience with the IT department was so much better here than it was there, so the attention or lack thereof is not limited to students at either institution.\n\nI'm prouder of the college where I work than I am of Stanford. Stanford is absolutely doing some cool stuff, but we're genuinely trying to make a difference.",

No honestly this is a big problem not just with IT with everything that doesnt grant a degree. \n\nStanford salaries suck and the whole area is crazy expensive with terrible transportation options. So anyone worth their money will either do the same job in tech (or other well paying industry) or not come here in the first place. The incompetence we see is simply a byproduct of Stanford\u2018s location paired with its unwillingness to compete with dominant local businesses. In the end, what you pay for is what you get\u2026",

A lot of people where I work make do with the lower pay because of the community here and because they believe in the school's mission...though that becomes more and more difficult as the purse strings become tighter and tighter.\n\nIt's expensive to live where we are, too, though nothing like Northern California and we also don't have Silicon Valley nearby, either. If Stanford isn't making it worth it for people to work there, either in direct compensation or in some other intangible ways, then they'll never have quality people, just like you said.",

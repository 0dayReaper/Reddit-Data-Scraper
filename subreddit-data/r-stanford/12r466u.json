    "postText": "Hi, so basically the title. I started this year in the math 19 series and finished 19/20. At the end of 20 the professor put a lot emphasis on the utility of math 21 before 51 so I took it instead of 51 this quarter\u2026 \n\nthe more classes I attend, knowing how irrelevant it is to math 51, an actual requirement, the more miserable it makes me. I just don\u2019t see the point in continuing to take it, I\u2019m not even a math person like that. The only thing stopping me from dropping it is that the course description lists it as necessary for quantitative research, though econ still isn\u2019t one of the degrees that requires it. Do you guys think it\u2019s beneficial enough for me to keep devoting time to it, or am I good to drop?",

            "comment": "Understanding series is pretty vital to understanding stats but I think you could finish the required Econ stats classes without doing 21, although you may need to brush up on certain concepts. Tbf the same is true for math 51; the concepts they pull from 51 for Econ 50 are extremely simple and the calculations in that class are unbearably dumbed-down. It\u2019s unfortunate that they\u2019re very strict about the 51 requirement because everyone knows it\u2019s not necessary.\n\nAll of the above is null if you\u2019re interested in graduate Econ/understanding the quantitative Econ stuff beyond a superficial level.",

                            "comment": "It's not similar: improper integrals are just a mild extension of more familiar integrals over bounded regions, whereas infinite series (and especially power series) involves a wide array of new concepts (but like any topic in math, it becomes intuitive with experience).\n\nIf you will ever need to do anything non-trivial with probability &amp; statistics, infinite series and power series show up everywhere there.  It is much easier to grok the material now in a course with people to learn from &amp; get questions answered and refresh your memory later (if necessary) than to never learn it now and find yourself needing to teach it to yourself from scratch on your own.\n\nI recommend to stick it out.  Your Math 20 instructor was correct: this material has many uses, and probability &amp; statistics in particular is a killer app for pretty much everything in Math 21.   (Bonus: the LSAT has a \"logic puzzles\" part which many students find challenging but is very easy for people who have more experience grappling with math, to digest non-trivial definitions and hypotheses and arrive at consequences.)",

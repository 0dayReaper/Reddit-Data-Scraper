I have never used my heater and even sent in a fix-it ticket so still not sure what is going on.  has anyone else experienced this? thanks!",

            "comment": "Steam radiators require pipes so when someone turns theirs on, if the pipe passes through your room, that\u2019ll be heating up just the same as the radiator. Is the pipe clean? If it\u2019s not, you\u2019re probably smelling whatever gunk is on there. Pro tip: before you clean it, make sure it\u2019s not on. You don\u2019t want to burn yourself or vaporize whatever cleaning products you\u2019re using\u2026 I made the mistake of vaporizing bleach while cleaning a radiator (it was in a bathroom) I didn\u2019t think was on and just about hacked my lung up (I think I probably made a small amount of chlorine gas.)",

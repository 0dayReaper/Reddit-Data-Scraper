The majority of Stanford departments/schools rank in the top 5, with most of the rest making at least the top 10, from business to law to medicine to engineering to the sciences to ... You get the point.  As a result, many more people will recognize the name Stanford compared to CMU.\n\nCMU is prestigious mostly for Engineering/CS.  Stanford is prestigious overall.  You will have to decide whether this is relevant to your career path (which you can't always predict).",

Stanford's name is more prestigious to the average tech worker plus you'll be right by all of the companies in Silicon Valley. This makes it super easy to do an internship during the summer since you don't need to move, plus you can stay in the area with your friends after graduation.",

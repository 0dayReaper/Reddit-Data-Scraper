    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an undergraduate at another university who got an internship near Stanford (close to Evergreen Park). I was wondering if there were any GroupMe chats or other ways people at Stanford sublease. I know there\u2019s a FB group and there are a few websites I\u2019ve been on. I don\u2019t know anybody that lives in the area so I\u2019m a bit clueless of how to start hunting for subleases.\n\nThanks in advance for your help :)",

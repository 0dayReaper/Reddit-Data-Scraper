    "title": "My daughter got accepted to CS,but this year she keeps getting sick with fevers, strong coughs (pulmonologists say she has small airway disease and/or asthma), not to mention her severe facial acne. What happens with students who get sick often and miss classes, can they still pass their CS courses?",

    "postText": "We live on literally the other side of the world, so of course we're worried about sending her there with all the times we had to go to doctors these past four months (and one pulmonologist made us seriously stressed out, saying if she's not on constant medication she risks airway remodeling, another saying the damage is done and she should not take more medication, anyway, it's a mess). I graduated years ago, and I know that she will have access to health professionals (hopefully for the dermatological issue too), but if she keeps having all these health issues and misses out on classes, are they understanding? Does she have to take exams for most courses (which means that if she can't get out of bed she'll miss them) or is are most of them take-home exams or papers?\n\nOf course we're hoping that all the health issues this year were caused by the fact that after safety measures viruses came back really strong and that at Stanford she'll be absolutely perfect health-wise. But, one can never know and Decision Day is coming soon...\n\nThank you all. I truly wish you GOOD HEALTH. I know Stanford students are stressed out, but, really, health is all that matters...",

            "comment": "You replied to a previous comment of mine, and my recommendation is the same: you and your daughter should get in contact with the Office of Accessible Education, as they can give you a realistic picture of what accommodations are available. Some options can include guaranteed assignment extensions, access to course recordings or notetakers (who attend the class and take notes, which are made available to students who have the requisite accommodations), and increased flexibility with exams. Your daughter could also get approval for a reduced course load, where the minimum unit count drops to 8? instead of the standard 12. Getting these accommodations will require documentation of her conditions from a doctor, which doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue for her.\n\nAnother note: I have a number of friends with significant health issues who receive accommodations, and while accommodations help, they\u2019re no substitute for having better health. They\u2019re making it through, but they aren\u2019t graduating within four years (leaves of absence, reduced course loads, etc.). This isn\u2019t a Stanford-specific issue, and students with health issues face similar challenges at other universities (source: multiple friends at other T20s with similar experiences). At least at Stanford, your daughter is right down the street from one of the best hospitals in the country, so attending to her health needs won\u2019t be as much of an imposition (e.g. missing less class to make it to appointments) and the OAE here is very capable and responsive (no weeks-long wait times to get helped).",

She actually did follow your advice and submitted a request to have her own bedroom to the Office of Accessible Education (which has yet to respond interestingly enough). We hadn't thought about asking them for further accommodations, i.e. for exams, not just for housing, but just when we thought the health issues were over, well, they're not :( \n\nWe're trying to remain optimistic, that everything will be solved once she goes to Stanford (honestly, I never got sick, not for one day, while I was studying there, but sadly my daughter seems so much more susceptible to catching diseases, and it breaks my heart :( However, if she starts having to miss out on classes again, especially during the winter months, then I suppose she can submit the request for special accommodations for exams and classes even after the academic year begins, all signed by Stanford doctors? (whom we are praying she'll never have to go see...). Do students at Stanford still wear masks? I hope my daughter will be one of them...\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your friends having significant health issues. I hope all will turn out well for them, and for everyone. School and grades and money are really nothing compared to being in good health. I couldn't see it either when I was younger, so much stress about trivial things, but now I so do.",

I\u2019m sorry to hear the OAE hasn\u2019t responded to her request yet, but they might not be fielding such requests from prospective students at this time (I believe the housing forms for new students don\u2019t go live until June, if I remember correctly). The good thing about class accommodations is that your daughter can apply for them at pretty much any time. Note that accommodations can\u2019t be applied retroactively, so it\u2019s better to get them sorted sooner rather than later. She should be able to submit proof from her current doctors, and the academic accommodations should get sorted out in August/September. I don\u2019t see many students or professors wearing masks in classrooms these days, but the vaccine recommendations for other students + masking herself should provide her with decent protection.",

On the masking culture here: you'll definitely see some people masking when walking around campus and in classroom buildings, but what I hear from students is that there aren't a lot of people in for ex. the dorms consistently masking. And only a small percent of instructors ask students to mask in that particular class. But I think we're fortunate in that the surrounding area &amp; the wider Bay Area aren't so hostile to masks as much of the U.S.  I can also say that we have better air quality in classrooms than many other places -- when I've had CO2 rise above 1000, Environmental Health and Safety have done a great job of addressing it (with more fresh air coming into rooms, &amp; bringing in a higher powered HEPA filter). The classroom I'm currently teaching in has never reached a reading over 900. \n\nAnd both COLLEGE and PWR courses are much more about regular writing practices and process than about writing tests/exams. There's typically lots of support built into such classes for revising and taking feedback into account. Your daughter could also use the resources/support from the writing &amp; speaking center on campus, which offers both remote &amp; in-person sessions. Also, there have been initiatives with COLLEGE to practice \"grading contracts,\" which tend to be more process and labor based ways of assessing students' work.",

We have a very important decision to take right now (apart from whether or not she'll study there. I know that turning down Stanford CS would be insane, but can we risk her having long-term health problems if the right way to treat her condition is not followed :(. One doctor says she should be on daily medication for asthma so as not to worsen her lung condition, another says the side effects aren't worth it if she only has a flare like 1-2 per year, I wish there was a way of knowing what doctors at Stanford would tell her. I'm thinking of accompanying her to Stanford for the first couple of days, but I think you first need to get a referral and then go to a pulmonologist, which means I would have to come back to my country/work and she'll go by herself to the appointment... I wonder if it's possible for parents to take part virtually in a doctor's appointment, does anyone happen to know?",

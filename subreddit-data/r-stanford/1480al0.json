So I use LLM to build connection among knowledge across various subjects. The goal is to see a bigger picture when I learn, and ideally manage my learning on concept level.\n\nMy effort in creating such a map: [https://afaik.io/nebula](https://afaik.io/nebula)\n\nThis idea might be just crazy but I hope it helps some curious folks like me here.",

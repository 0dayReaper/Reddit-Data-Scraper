To request your absentee ballot from click [here](https://ballotrequest.sos.ga.gov/) and register to voter [here](https://registertovote.sos.ga.gov)\n\nI would also highly recommend reaching out to friends and family in GA to confirm they're registered. Also, anyone who will be 18 when the election happens in January will be eligible to register, even if they're 17 now.",

I joined Flip the West\u2019s campaign, but you can do your own research and see if there\u2019s a better fit for you!\n\nOur friends in Georgia have a huge opportunity to decide how these next two years in the U.S. unfold. Even though many of us can\u2019t vote in those elections, we can at least try to engage and make a difference from afar.\n\nKeeping my fingers crossed here!",

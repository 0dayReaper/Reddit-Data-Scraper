    "postText": "Help Choosing Between Stanford or MIT for undergrad computer science\n\nHello, I am an incoming undergraduate student hoping to study CS. I have the option between two great schools: MIT and Stanford. Both would cost me the same, so I am stuck on which one I should choose. I have visited both and talked with students there, and seem to have loved them equally. Is there any recommendations or pros and cons that anyone could mention about each school to help me make my decision? Thank you.",

            "comment": "Have you visited both schools?\n\nGiven the other factors you mentioned held constant, I would think about cultural differences between the schools. At Stanford, even though STEM is the main academic culture here, there's only a select population of students that make STEM/CS their entire personality. Most people you meet here are generally laid back (it's a facade they're still stressed), and they tend to focus on student groups or other concerns in life outside of just school. At MIT, I think there's more of a culture of making your major who you are. Obviously that's a bit of a generalization, but that's just my impressions from visiting MIT/talking to students relative to Stanford.\n\nSome other factors to consider:\n\n* Do you strongly prefer warm weather and does it affect your mood? (Stanford)\n* Do you prefer an active lifestyle in your downtime? (Stanford)\n* Do you prefer having a college town, and being near to other institutions? (MIT)\n* Do you have an idea what student groups you might be interested in? Check the pages for both across the schools. I'm biased but Stanford has some really strong cultural and entrepreneurial groups if that's what you're interested in, while MIT might have some strong research or academic-focused groups.\n* Are you first-gen/low-income? Resources at Stanford are incredible and grow every year, I can't comment on MIT for this.\n\nYou can see my bias here, but my point is that you should think of cultural elements of the schools and what matters more to you between both. Research student groups, read more candid posts across campus subreddits, try to find what the schools are like for students.",

I'd say that MIT's version offers more research-based material using a hands-on and project based approach, whereas Stanford works well in a well-rounded way. Stanford also has great CS research opportunities but they differ slightly. If I wanted to learn about app/web development or CS from principles, I'd pick Stanford. If I were eager to use CS in projects like controlling robots or running simulations, I'd lean towards MIT.\n\nAnother important factor to consider is the location. Would you rather live in California or Massachusetts?  \nMIT is located next to a lot of great schools like Harvard and is more-so in the city area. Many MIT students opt into taking a few courses from Harvard when they're enrolled into MIT.\n\nStanford is not too far from the beach. The land is very flat. Sports are great here, and I find the students there are more well-rounded than those at MIT. This place is also a good option for entrepreneurship.\n\nIf you're interested in Greek life, Stanford would be a better bet.\n\nCalifornia is known to be hot year-round. Winters are not as snowy or cold as those you'd find in MA.",

If you should suddenly decide that CS isn't for you and that instead you'd rather study French literature, or Russian history, or English, Stanford's pedigree on average would be a bit higher than MIT's in any of the liberal arts.\n\nRegardless, congratulations on your acceptance to both.

Even when you get off campus in downtown Palo Alto, Mountain View area it is still miserable. It is such a HASSLE and a whole day trip to get on the cal train to visit sf or San Jose and a bit dangerous as well going very late at night. Renting zip cars will blow holes in your wallet and is also just really inconvenient with the hour restrictions. As someone who searched online for this type of info, NO ONE mentioned how draining (time, money, coordinating with friends) it is to actually make the effort to \u201ctravel the bay\u201d when you\u2019re at stanford. It makes life so much harder. Would really recommend prospective students to ask themselves what kind of social life they\u2019ll like at stanford vs other equivalently-ranked schools.

Indivusl Dorms get less funding and instead go to \u201cneighborhood funds\u201d which are only accessible by a length approval and application process. This also FORCES students to be assigned to a cohort of dorms for all 4 years, meaning if a student ends up meeting friends outside this \u201ccohort/neighborhood\u201d, they literally CANNOT live with their new friends\u2026. ResEd at stanford is basically just a cash grab and is one of the worst housing systems in the T20 college scene. Also, our office of student engagement makes it extremely difficult for clubs/student orgs to host social events + ASSU Annual Grant, which is the main source of funding for clubs, is EXTREMELY frustrating to work with and many clubs have gotten their WHOLE budget denied (Stanford\u2019s Society of Latinx Engineers, Kids With Dreams - a club literally \u201cdedicated to improving the lives of individuals with special needs\u201d, and MANY more). We also have over 10k admin that don\u2019t really contribute or help to student life. After lots of effort we recently reinstated our shopping express free bus lines, which is important for many students to do their grocery shopping at stores that don\u2019t overprice their products (Palo Alto+ Stanford Shops). Initially our incompetent Vice provost denied this request due to \u201cinsufficient funds\u201d even though the cost to implement this is less than 2% of the total stanford budget. Our president is corrupt (MTL faking research data) and our Vice provost doesn\u2019t care about student  well-being (note Katie Meyer incident and how stanford treated her) or our already non-existent social life. These are points not talked about in stanford vlogs, tik toks, or blog posts lmao",

Once you have a solid grasp on technical knowledge, it\u2019s easier to branch out and seek other learning experiences, than the other way around. \nIt\u2019s not to say that the learning experience at MIT is not holistic\u2026",

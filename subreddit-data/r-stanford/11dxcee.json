            "comment": "Hi: There was a thread on Twitter re: this yesterday or the day before. Most of the responses were from Stanford professors who all said they \"recommend\" masking but don't enforce it unless a student requests it. A few of the professors said they wear masks in 'solidarity' with undergrads who may want to wear masks but are afraid to do so. My impression is that most profs want to accommodate students and avoid conflict. So my advice to you is just ask a professor to accommodate your student's concerns. Most will, I bet.",

The reality is that public health experts have determined that the benefits of \u201cmasking for all\u201d no longer outweigh the costs for the public. There won\u2019t be any professors requiring masking except for a few who have compromised immune systems,etc. If you have a compromised immune system there are plenty of options available for mitigation and you should seek the help of a qualified doctor. If you don\u2019t have a diagnosed condition that has compromised your immune system and you\u2019re *still* worried about covid, despite the plethora of vaccines and the already low risk you have as a young person, just throw on a bubble suit.",

                    "comment": "I'd rather not engage with someone who's obviously trolling, but I won't let misinformation stand on this thread. First, masking is associated with wellness. (No amount of throwing the word \"verbiage\" around will change that.) There's a reason n95s are regulated and held to industry standards. Even with our lack of public health/education about what \"airborne\" means and how exactly respirator-style masks work, masking is still associated with lower disease. See the many pieces responding, for ex., to the problematic Cochrane Review -- this from [Lucky Tran for The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/27/dont-believe-those-who-claim-science-proves-masks-dont-work), this from [Vox](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/2/22/23609499/masks-covid-coronavirus-cochrane-review-pandemic-science-studies-infection), etc.\n\nSecond, I'd love to see your receipts for these amazing \"mitigations\" available to the immunocompromised. Last I checked, [we ran through monoclonal antibodies some time ago,](https://www.wired.com/story/a-crucial-group-of-covid-drugs-has-stopped-working/) as the omicron lineages have been allowed to spread unchecked and evolve beyond our \"tools.\" Paxlovid unfortunately interferes with many other drugs and is not an option for all, plus can be tough to access in the initial window when it's actually been shown to help (and of course it's a treatment, not a preventative measure). \n\nThird, the vaccines are a great tool but have very much diminished in their effectiveness to prevent infections, and studies have found only modest protection against Long Covid, from 15-25% ([this one](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01453-0) cites 15%). There's also a whole laundry list of other complications that can arise post covid-19, including those affecting [the cardiovascular system](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01689-3). As those authors of the Nature study note, \"The risks were evident regardless of age, race, sex and other cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and hyperlipidemia; they were also evident in people without any cardiovascular disease before exposure to COVID-19, providing evidence that these risks might manifest even in people at low risk of cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nAlso, since it's clear from your post empathy is an area for growth, you might spare a thought for the many people in our community who can't afford to risk their health, easily see doctors, etc. Viruses don't stay in one place, or on one campus (and even on that campus, you'll notice a lot of people working who can't afford to live in the Bay Area). Once the public health emergency ends, it will be even harder for those people to get access to even those tools/mitigations that are still working. \n\nNow that we've covered why people might have valid reasons for preferring a classroom environment where the instructor acknowledges covid isn't over, does anyone actually have any leads on the actual question asked? (Sigh. And apologies to everyone who didn't need a whole PSA.)",

Now it is just funneling into major depression. Maybe OP is fine but they should definitely seriously ask themselves where this fear comes from.

Again, I want to thank you for engaging much more thoughtfully than the trolling above! But I've noticed a general rush to \"pathologize\" and label people \"crazy\" if they're taking some common-sense precautions given that covid-19 is still very much spreading in our community. ([The Santa Clara County wastewater tracker](https://covid19.sccgov.org/dashboard-wastewater) is a useful tool; we haven't dipped below medium/high readings in months.) On the one hand, yes, we all take risks. On the other hand, most of us haven't faced a risk like covid-19 in our lifetimes. We don't yet know what multiple infections per year for many years will mean for people's lifespans and long-term health. And as much as one might regret not taking some risks in the name of \"living one's life,\" a lot of people with Long Covid have written very eloquently and heartbreakingly about how much they wish they'd *not* taken those risks. In an age of \"you do you\" public health, I'd hope we can respect people's choices when they're trying to err on the side of caution. Again, if anyone has leads, I'd love to keep on topic here and not involve individuals' particular health statuses.",

Your perception of Covid-19 may be a bit skewed, like no it most likely is not the biggest risk in our lifetime (at least not healthwise). Nobody knows the economic and societal aftermath. But you put this far out of proportion, even just right now, speaking of global events, the chance of a nuclear war is a billion times more problematic than anything good old Covid19 will ever do. \n\nSure long covid exists, but similar things existed for any other infection yet nothing else has gotten the attention level of Covid19. I'd be much more afraid of driving a car or having unprotected sex, for instance, which likely has a higher risk for a young healthy individual. But ye, you do you. Wish you all the best!",

Over a million people have died in the U.S. of covid-19, it's the third leading cause of death in the U.S. still (and that's likely quite an undercount, given that it's also causing a rise in things like heart attacks that will mean covid is not on the death certificate), and life expectancy continues to drop. Absolutely agree that we have always needed more attention to post-viral illnesses/sequelae, like ME/CFS, but Long Covid is very widespread, so it poses more of a risk. I think you're making a lot of assumptions about my health/risk status (and the student I am gathering info for). Again, would rather not disclose individual health statuses. Instead, to use your own metaphor of driving: we recognize that driving holds risks. And as a society, we build in layers of safety to mitigate those risks. We have to learn how to drive, pass a test, maintain our license, follow safety rules; car manufacturers continually iterate on better safety measures; our government enforces safety protocols through regulations and laws. It's not unreasonable to expect that, if we're going to \"live with covid,\" we think about how to build in more layers of mitigations. Ideally, places like Stanford would regularly upgrade indoor air quality standards, post those transparently, even provide CO2 monitors so students know that the ventilation is working correctly. For now, again, trying to follow leads for classrooms that are trying to layer in these mitigations.",

And this isn't a pie in the sky ask -- Stanford already has a great team of people over at Environmental Health and Safety and many buildings with decent systems. It just hasn't been a priority to emphasize clean air or to enable the community to easily check it. For ex., I believe most classroom buildings are aiming for 6 exchanges of air per hour (ACH), when that's the minimum of the recommended window (6-12 ACH).  For reference, my dentist aims for 50 ACH. When the system isn't working properly, most people won't notice -- unless they have a $200 (minimum) CO2 monitor (which was what helped one faculty member spot a problem w/ their classroom, according to [this Daily article)](https://stanforddaily.com/2023/02/02/professor-finds-abnormally-high-concentrations-of-carbon-dioxide-in-classroom/).",

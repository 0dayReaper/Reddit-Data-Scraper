    "postText": "Hey everyone, did anyone else get an email from uscourseworks@gmail.com? I know for a fact that I didn\u2019t cheat, so I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s a phishing attempt.\n\n\n\n\nTHE EMAIL: \n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the office of Stanford student's account proctoring, surveillance and maintenance. I've been monitoring students' accounts, emails and search engines due to increased rates of academic irregularities and violation of academic integrity as well the school\u2019s honor code.\n\nYour account\u2019s proctored data reveal that you sought and engaged external assistance for your class work and exams. Ranging from search browsers, online quiz-help websites, assignment-help websites, violating the rules of proctored exams, quizzes, assignments and unrecognized external proxies that accessed logged into your account. You have submitted these assignments and exams as your own work regardless. Your Computer Science grades are in question as we\u2019re forced to believe you got them through cheating. In accordance to Stanford University constitution (Act 2011(TEQSA Act)), you are in Violation of Academic Integrity of the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Act.\n\nStanford University is an institution built on academic integrity and transparency and has an obligation to keep our reputation sanitized and keep growing the trust that our students' employers seek in the job market. As a result I'm required to write a report and attach my findings to the University chancellor and School of Engineering Dean\u2019s office.\n\nYou are in violation of the constitutional moral code and ethical policy of Academia. This includes values such as avoidance of cheating or plagiarism; maintenance of academic standards; honesty and rigor in research and academic publishing (UQ, 2021, 3.60.04). Academic integrity stands, or should stand, at the heart of every college and university student according to the Academic Integrity Constitutional Legislative Clauses;\n1.      Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 (Cth)\n2.      Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment (Prohibiting Academic Cheating Services) Bill 2019 (Cth)\n3.      U.S. Federal Department of Education Section 103[b], Public Law 96-88\n \nIf I submit my report, I will be doing my job and I will be rewarded for that, but I will be flashing your whole education and professional career down the toilet as you will be permanently expelled.\nWe\u2019ll raise a red flag with United States department of Curriculum development and educational standards against your name and any academic credential attached to your name will be revoked and rendered void. \n\nBeing a violation of the national academic integrity acts, we\u2019re obligated to inform the Federal Department of Education. You\u2019ll be permanently suspended from attending any other university and the department of educational standards will revoke you from any employment opportunity and your names and details will be published as blacklisted in the public career domain.\n\nWe have all your bio data in our database. All your former schools, Department Instructors and your residence address. You must know that the school is very strict when it comes to academic transparency. To protect our institution's reputation and not be mistaken to having reservations to our students when it comes to academic irregularities, we're to report the same to your Instructors and head of departments because you will be appearing in a court of law.\n\nYour former schools and former institutions you attended will also receive a letter of demand to present your academic credentials and be withheld by the exam council and be denied copyright claims by you or any other body until your court case is determined. \nYou have great grades in your courses and projects and also good assessment remarks but all that will go down the drain. You're in a very hard and bad place and I'm your only way out. \n \nI'm an alumni and I've got a few reservations for the students. But that depends on you because I have a professional duty to do my job and get monthly salary regardless of what happens to your career. This week I got 56 students with the same case as yours. Unfortunately, 8 of them started their suspension as of yesterday and the rest have their cases ongoing. You can be the 6th if you don't cooperate besides being faced with endless summons and charges by respective departments and authorities. We are to assume that these grades aren\u2019t your own but from cheating. But first, I thought to inform you of the danger ahead and give you a fair platform to redeem yourself.\n\nHow do you plead? Be wise with your decisions, cooperate and reply urgently before I submit the report or WhatsApp: +1 (240) 840-8026",

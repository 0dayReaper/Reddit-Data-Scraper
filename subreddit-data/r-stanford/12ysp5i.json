    "postText": "Hi all! I\u2019m an incoming MSCS student starting this coming fall. I was awarded a guaranteed five quarter CA-ship by the CS department, and it mentions that it comes with a stipend. \n\nI\u2019m trying to gather things together as far as what to expect, so I was wondering if any other students who\u2019ve received this quarterly stipend can let me know about it. I\u2019d mainly be interested in seeing if it\u2019s a lump sum payment, and when to expect to receive it every quarter. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Did they mention what percentage? CAship (or RAship in my case) comes with TAL (tuition allowance) which covers tuition and a stipend which is paid every 2 weeks. I think the TAL is applied automatically. To actually see the numbers of what to expect, you can look up Stanford Graduate Tuition Assistant tables and there\u2019s a breakdown that differs per school (GSB, school of engineering, etc)",

    "postText": "I took the equivalent of certain prerequisites such as CS 106A and 106B prior to coming here. CS Profs have approved the equivalency. However, I even if it's transferred, it will only be for Credit/No credit. I also recently heard somewhere that you need to take certain classes for a letter grade if it's for your major. \n\nDoes anyone know if I major in CS (or Symsys) will this be okay/count towards the major? Preciate it.",

However, during the pandemic, some of those rules were suspended and credit/no credit (Pass/fail) grades were allowed. Some departments have now gone back to requiring the usual rules  -- while 'grandfathering' in those who took advantage of the pandemic policy --  and some have not. Ask the student services officer in your major. Or follow Stansion's advice below and ask your UAD.",

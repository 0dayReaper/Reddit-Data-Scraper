    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m aiming to get a A (not A-) in CS106b. I just got back my midterm grades and I\u2019m a half a standard deviation below the median ): I\u2019ve been getting check pluses and pluses on the assignments. How difficult do you think it\u2019ll be to get an A?\n\nThank you for the help.",

I did better on the final and did similar to you on assignments. One thing to look out for is I think check-pluses are more like A-/B+ than A the way they do the grading at least my year (or soemthing to this extent) Depends on the year tho, so of course the course staff knows better",

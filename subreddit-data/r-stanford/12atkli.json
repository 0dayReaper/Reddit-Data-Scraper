    "postText": "Hi everyone, I've thought of new question to ask!\n\nHow do people often leave campus (public transport? by car?) and is it necessary to leave campus? How often do you leave campus and for what?\n\nI'm asking this because I'll be an international student (undergrad) at Stanford next fall and there is no way I'm buying a car. I am thinking of buying a bicycle to get around campus though. I really appreciate your help!\n\nEdit: okay I'm definitely buying a bike",

            "comment": "Edit: wow this was really long and ranty. Skip to the tldr unless you are particularly interested in the intricacies of leaving campus without a car.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to leave campus and you don\u2019t need a car\u2014most students don\u2019t have one\u2014but it is *so* nice to have a vehicle. Absolute life changer if you\u2019re the sort of person who hates living in a bubble. Makes errands and emergencies so much easier to deal with, and you get to actually explore the area.\n\nOptions if you don\u2019t have a car are public transport, zipcar and Uber/lyft. Public transport is marred by the fact that the marguerite doesn\u2019t operate on weekends, so you either walk a half hour down palm drive or bike to the caltrain/vta station. Caltrain heads both north and south; vta bus system is more concentrated around South Bay. Bikes sometimes get stolen around the Palo Alto station so my old modus operandi was bringing my bike onboard wherever I went, which was helpful for last mile issues. Main problem is that many places don\u2019t have specific areas to lock your bike, so you just lock the frame to a hard pole and hope no one steals the wheel. Both caltrain and vta allow bikes, and that\u2019s maybe the only positive thing about them. Both are quite infrequent and in my opinion, sorry excuses of public transport. You\u2019ll have to plan your time quite carefully if you plan on relying on either.\n\nZipcar is very expensive now (cheapest are 13/hr before insurance and tax) and only worth it if you need to make multiple trips throughout the day. The main issue with zipcar is that you need to return it to the exact spot you borrowed it from. So you can\u2019t return it momentarily when you arrive wherever you need. No, the clock is still running while you spend that hour at the supermarket, even though you\u2019re not driving. It stays running until you drive back and return the car. This tends to add up to the point that it\u2019s just as economical to call an Uber or Lyft. With ridehailing you also 1. don\u2019t have to drive yourself 2. don\u2019t feel pressed for time. The only time I\u2019d get a zipcar is if you\u2019re headed to a bunch of places (in which case ride-hailing is relatively expensive) or niche cases like moving packages into a storage center. Anyhow, you\u2019re not getting the zipcar unless you\u2019ve planned the day out pretty well and you know 1. If the zipcar makes sense 2. How many hours you might need.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the issue with these two options: they\u2019re both inflexible and best suited for when you\u2019ve planned things out decently. Ride-hailing is flexible enough, but wow is it expensive, which is natural because you\u2019re literally asking someone to be a temporary chauffeur for you. It\u2019s cheaper if you split the bill with others, but then there\u2019s no flexibility. Do you see what I\u2019m getting at here? Without a car, your options to leave the bubble are either very inflexible or expensive. And this is not bad for students who like the bubble, or only leave campus at very regular, planned times. But if you\u2019re a spontaneous bastard like me, and you like to visit new places on a whim, then the personal vehicle is such a game changer, even with the high Californian gas prices. This isn\u2019t Stanford specific: this is the life of American suburbia, which was designed around the car. Fortunately, many colleges are located in more compact cities and college towns, where a car is always nice but less necessary. If you were accepted by schools of similar stature in more convenient areas, you should sincerely consider them if you care about exploring the area.\n\nTldr you will be fine if you like the bubble, as many do (perfectly valid choice). If you like roving about, i strongly recommend getting a car or a friend with a car.",

            "comment": "Regarding biking on campus, definitely get one. I tried a few weeks without one and it was impossible to get from one class to the other on time on foot. Then again, one of my good friends did all four years on foot somehow.\n\nThere isn't really a *need* for a car on campus, but it is nice to have one. I had a car and used it almost exclusively for weekend restaurant trips. Occasionally, we went on road trips. I once used it to go to my LSAT testing site. I didn't even use the car to go to the airport. Even without your own car, you will likely have friends with cars. My friend group had extra cars, so we rotated among who drove and had no problem giving rides to our car-free friends, who sometimes chipped in for gas.\n\nLyft, Uber, ZipCar, Caltrain, and friends should be enough for anything you need to do.\n\nGoing to either SFO or SJC is a Marguerite ride to the Caltrain to the official airport shuttle if you do public transportation. You can easily get Lyft, Uber, or a private shuttle service to go to the airport as well. SJC is definitely closer to Stanford, but SFO has way more international flights. OAK is possible, but a slog from Stanford (and if you do public transportation, you have to take the Caltrain to BART for it, but SFO has more international flights than OAK anyway).",

    "postText": "Incoming '27 here going into CS. Should I go for a MacBook + an iPad pro (for note-taking) or a 2-in-1 windows laptop. Idk how prevalent digital notetaking is or whether it's even efficient with the heavy workload, but I thought it'd be easier than doing math/physics classes with handwritten notes. The Apple package is significantly pricier and idk how useful an iPad may even be",

MacBook + iPad Pro is the most popular option, but I use a windows 2-in-1 and think that it\u2019s a perfectly valid option for a cheaper price point. If you like the apple idea better though, I\u2019d suggest getting an iPad Air instead of a pro as it can do basically everything you need in terms of note take taking",

Normal \"Windows\" laptops are great because Debian derivatives run fine on them, but Windows 2 in 1s often will be dead-on-arrival if you are planning to install any variant of Linux on it.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm currently a high school senior who will be attending Stanford University in the fall. I'm very interested in pursuing a career in neuroscience and medicine, with the ultimate goal of becoming a physician-scientist and conducting research in this field.\n\nI'm considering majoring in Symsys with a focus on neuroscience, as I think it would be a great fit for my academic interests. However, I'm also concerned about whether this track would adequately prepare me for medical school and the possibility of getting into an MD-PhD program in the future.\n\nI would really appreciate any advice or insights from current or former Stanford students, especially those who have pursued a similar career path. What major did you choose, and do you think it helped you in your pursuit of medicine and neuroscience? Any advice on how to make the most of my time at Stanford to achieve my career goals would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

I have been told that I will need to take Math 51 as a requirement from my peers\u2026 however I have not found anything backing this up on the major requirements webpage. Can any current IR majors or just anyone who knows give any insight about the level of math IR requires. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor context I have never taken a calc class and while I am willing to learn and give it my all\u2026 I would rather not.",

(A lot of the classes might also require lower level Econ, which in turn have math reqs.) There are also a number of classes that meet this Econ requirement without having any prereqs. I took one that was on economics in the EU with Crombez and it luckily didn\u2019t have any major math/Econ prereqs, but it was super oversubscribed when enrollment opened bc obviously everybody had the same idea lmao",

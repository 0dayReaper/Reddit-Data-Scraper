Llaga is consistent, lakeside has late night which is both purchasable with dining dollars and quite cheap for stanford food. Stern and Llaga reportedly have good tater tots for weekend brunch, though they\u2019ve both been letting me down immensely in recent memory. You just can\u2019t win sometimes.",

Though I would value proximity over food quality especially since it all tastes the same lol. If I have a class on main campus I would probably go to flomo but if i have a class in the engineering quad I\u2019ll go to ricker or lakeside. A lot of incoming frosh have the tendency of forgetting how huge the campus actually is and realistically not many people would be willing to bike over a mile just to eat at a certain dining hall",

    "postText": "Hi all! This is something I've been noticing more lately in this sub that I wanted to bring up: non-Stanford students posting asking Stanford students to send them Stanford-only resources like books or syllabi. I completely understand the motivations behind why people ask, but quite frankly, it's annoying, these posts often don't get many, if any, replies, and they take away from the purpose of r/stanford, which is for Stanford students and alums to discuss Stanford stuff. There is often a reason these resources are behind a Stanford firewall, and they should be procured officially through the university.\n\n**What I'd like to propose is a new rule: no unsolicited requests**. This isn't unprecedented (college subs like r/Harvard already have similar rules) and I think it would improve the quality of this space. The wording I'm thinking about (modified from r/Havard's) would be something like: \n\n\"No unwanted or unsolicited requests for library books, course syllabi, or other information that requires a Stanford login. If you are a student at another institution and need access to a Stanford resource, please pursue that through an official route directly with the university.\"\n\nWould love to hear what other people think (or if it's just me that feels this way haha)",

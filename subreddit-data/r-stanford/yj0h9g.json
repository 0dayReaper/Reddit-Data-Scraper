A group where ppl just ask if they wanna grab a drink/lunch/dinner or anything.\n\nNot to single out PhDs or anything I just feel like MS come and go and eventually we part ways but PhD students stick around for a longer time, so there is a better chance friend groups can develop. I really hope to make some new friends throughout my stay here.",

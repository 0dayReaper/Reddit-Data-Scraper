    "postText": "I am sorry if this causes discomfort to anyone. I am not sure if I am alone.\nI was in a lab for my doctoral thesis work for 4 years and a half. Most of the time I have to work on my own without much support from my advisor. I have few friends, no relation, and no relatives in the United States. I don\u2019t think I ever considered suicide but I was indeed beaten many times in my mind there. I was a very happy person before Stanford and I am seriously impaired afterwards. I often times feel bad about all this.",

Maybe try going to a therapist to talk about how to put it behind you? Don't remove it from your CV, just build more stuff on top of it so you talk/think about that stuff instead.",

I hate the school i graduated from (not Stanford) and want nothing to do with it. I'm ashamed to tell people I went there. It took me a long time to reconcile all that stuff and be in a better place, but time heals all wounds. I put it behind me and mostly don't think about it anymore. I've done enough to regain my confidence and realize it wasn't a me issue, it was a him issue. It's still on my CV and it will be forever, but I'm not that person anymore, and I've made peace with that.",

I don't have any information beyond what you posted here, but it seems likely that the issue was the PhD lifestyle and stress, rather than Stanford itself. \n\nAs others have said, it sounds like you could benefit from discussing with a therapist and trying to work through some of this resentment that you feel. \n\nI wish you the best and hope that you can come to peace with your time spent on your PhD and move on to the next chapters of your life.",

It can be useful to bond and realize you\u2019re not alone.\n\nAs much as I love science, I do think academia is a toxic working environment for most people. You should try talking to a professional to help you process your emotions about this significant period of your life and move forward and get back to living. Things can and do get better.

Ended up at BU and we all became friends for life ... even though my advisor was an ass. I STILL became depressed afterwards as I went for a high money job where I couldn't socialize much and I missed my friends. I ended up moving to an industrial research lab where again I had the time of my life and went on to do startups/run businesses. Never looked back. Read Albert Ellis New Guide to Rational Living and/or the Stoic philosophers. You probably should dabble in therapy and meds -- they didn't work for me, but they work for many. Ellis really worked for me. Nothing \"broke\" inside you -- I felt my mind was utterly dead 2 years out. But I moved on and my mind \"unbroke\", even much better because nothing scared me after that and I learned to manage negative or anxious thoughts. That's how I had some hair raising startup adventures, got sued, all kinds of stuff happened. Keep and grow a group of friends.",

So, you supposedly lost 5 years. Oh well, why lose more worrying about it? Realize that you are still depressed and depressed thoughts are absolute BS. Long ago I learned to ignore them. The main purpose of my PhD and my later work is just to work and talk with cool people. I've ended up running companies of people who are way smarter than me, but just don't do the biz/networking stuff I do. Also, your thesis will suck, almost 99.9% of them do.

I think a lot of people would find it surprising how often it takes years of confidence building and directed mentoring to correct the damage done in some labs. My advice is to move on, work to find a great mentor at an institution that cares about developing people, and work to become what you envisioned when you started. I know it isn\u2019t that easy but it is possible.",

After grad school I got depressed for 2 years since I was earning boat loads of money in finance but hated it. So I switched back to research and never looked back. The first rule of life is to socialize and network widely. Keeps you happy. Read a book by Albert Ellis \"A Guide to Rational Living\" and/or read about the Stoic philosophers. Maybe stop being accomplishment driven and just focus on being a good person and see what happens. You can also try therapy and meds. Meds didn't work at all for me, and I had a crap therapist. A formerly depressed friend helped me out because ... he was no longer depressed. All that was 30 years ago, haven't been depressed since because of all my Albert Ellis and stoic practices and socializing/networking.",

I'm also about a year out of my (relatively turbulent and rocky) PhD, and I feel like there are habits and mindsets I developed during those 5 years that I wish I could get rid of. I'm told that it does fade with time. I believe it is pretty universally agreed upon that the PhD is the worst and most grueling part.",

Sure, it's way too crowded at peak hours, but that's hardly a sign of it sucking. I've also only seen 1 broken machine there in recent weeks (the pec fly / rear delt), which admittedly is taking a surprisingly long time to fix.\n\nI'm curious what people's comparison is when they say it sucks.",

Arrillaga had really great amenities and the pool was quite nice, but it all turned out to be utterly useless for me because of how insanely crowded it would get during peak hours. The waits for any one weight or cardio machine would often and easily reach 10+ minutes, thus rendering a quick, effective workout into a long slog with excessive wait times in between sets and exercises. On the few days that I had 2+ hours to spare in the evening for a workout, it was fine. But ultimately that proved to be unsustainable. \n\nI think if I had been a student, I'd have been able to schedule good workouts in between classes/slow days but as an employee, this was impossible. This, to me, was really sad because before working at Stanford, I had really looked forward to taking advantage of my free gym membership there. That never ended up happening.\n\nOh, and during my time at the farm the waitlist times for a non-single-day gym locker in either of the gyms was measured in years! This made the whole gym experience significantly worse tbh",

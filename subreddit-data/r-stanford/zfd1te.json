A result of the pandemic, SUNY schools becoming cheaper and more factors involved. \n\nCan Stanford\u2019s $36 billion endowment be some help to Cazenovia\u2019s $25 million debt? \n\nhttps://www.syracuse.com/news/2022/12/cazenovia-college-to-close-after-nearly-200-years.html?outputType=amp",

Not to give millions to a project to a school who has no current ties to them except that their robber baron founder attended it. Further, paying off someone else\u2019s debt makes no sense unless they can show they can sustain themselves without more debt once the current debt is paid, otherwise it\u2019s a waste.

            "comment": "Sorry to hear that, sad to see a longstanding institution fall. Not sure if you want an actual answer to your question or if you're just rhetorically comparing numbers but no, endowments don't work like that. Most endowment money is \"earmarked\" for very specific purposes (like paying a professor's salary, maintaining the Archeology building), and it would be against legal fiduciary responsibility for one college to donate their allocated funds to another institution. Even if you got someone to step in and pay off the $25 million, most nonprofit universities spend more on education per student than students pay, even at full tuition -- past generations' donations are what cover the gap to help current and future students enjoy those wonderful opportunities. If alumni support is broken at Cazenovia, then it's unlikely to survive past the temporary reprieve. Not guaranteed though -- a bright spot you can turn to is the case of [Sweet Briar College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Briar_College#Agreement_to_keep_the_college_open) a few years ago.",

If you want to save your college, it's going to take some massive mobilization. The path is unlikely, but not impossible.",

Since its peak with nearly 1,000 students on campus, Cazenovia\u2019s enrollment has dropped by over 40%.\n\nThis is an actual problem.  People think college is getting more competitive, but what's actually happening is high school students are focusing their applications more and more on brand name schools.",

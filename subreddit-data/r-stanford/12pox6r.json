    "postText": "Having a hard time making a decision--a following my heart vs brain dilemma.\n\nI got accepted into the MS Electrical Engineering program at Stanford and while it's been a dream school, I can't justify taking out loans, especially having no debt from undergrad. I'm going to apply for TA/RAships but those aren't guaranteed and I've heard can be a gamble as you may hear very last minute about them.\n\nThe alternative is doing my MS in Electrical/Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins, fully-funded and part-time while working a \\~95K salary job in Maryland.\n\nI feel like the choice is kinda obvious but wondering just how worth it the Stanford network is for someone? I also kind of just enjoy being a student, love the Bay Area, and am delaying the inevitable 9-5 lifestyle. I feel like Stanford's resources in EE are a different caliber than Hopkins",

            "comment": "Doing my PhD here and did my MS fully funded somewhere else, no regrets.\n\nHopkins funded seems like a better option. Hopkins is a top school like Stanford. And if you are making money on the process, I don't see what is the debate here. If you are working that will also add years of experience.",

            "comment": "It sounds like you\u2019re talking about JHU EP, which has notoriously bad courses and professors. It\u2019s a totally separate program from the main campus as it is run out of APL, their defense research lab. It also accepts essentially everyone who applies, which I\u2019d wager brings down the value of the degree. Tbh, I would avoid it unless you\u2019re just trying to tick a box. If you intend to get something out of your graduate education then come to Stanford.",

            "comment": "20 years ago I made a decision to do a fully funded MS in mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley over MS at Stanford.  I don't regret it (although Berkeley and Stanford are pretty much peers in engineering...but Stanford still has more \"wow\" name factor among lay people).  It just wasn't worth it from an ROI (return on investment) perspective.\n\nDepends on goals I would say.  If you want to end up doing a Phd, not having debt is awesome plus just being a bigger fish at a smaller pond to develop relationships with professors (at Hopkins).  If you know you want to switch to a start up working on IoT or cutting edge chip design at big Tech, then Stanford would get your foot in the door quicker there.  Once you get an interview then its up to you though and John Hopkins vs Stanford won't matter.\n\nNo right or wrong decision here.",

It\u2019s not too hard to get, but you need to talk to professors or other students to get recommended into it. Also, might not be possible for your first quarter, but definitely possible for your latter quarters. Helps if you had previous TA experience",

It is maybe nice if you are an international who has never lived in the US before though, it might give some good cultural experience.",

Good rule of thumb for these programs is - if they are truly selective/good, then they will be free (minus maybe like, COSMOS). If you really want to take classes, you can get similar content at a local college or university. Otherwise it's probably a better use of your summer time pursuing a hobby, doing research, or going to one of the free selective camps.",

It won't help you at Stanford since Stanford does not take demonstrated interest into account and the AOs know that this is a cash grab by the university.",

Stanford has one of the longest summer high school programs. Others are two, three, four week courses. Some also don\u2019t have the \u2018you have to be 16\u2019 which limits some kids till after their jr year to attend. It doesn\u2019t move the needle except if it shows an interests in a subject like neuroscience.",

You get to live on campus over the summer w/ a lot of independence and work with awesome peers. It won\u2019t help with admission into Stanford undergrad, but it\u2019s a great program.",

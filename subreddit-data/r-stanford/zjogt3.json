            "comment": "It's on the hard side but it's doable. Just keep in mind that CS231N is going to be pretty tough if it's your first AI course, and the psets and projects are a substantial time sink. I also probably wouldn't do it if you're a frosh, unless you're very mathematically mature (in which case don't take CS109 lol, just replace it with something that teaches probability more thoroughly).",

Nobody regrets taking whacky fun classes outside of their major, or staying up late on a Wednesday night to go steam tunneling. \n\nIf you think this is what's best for you, go for it. You might have great time management skills or awesome study groups for all of those classes. But don't force it. Be willing to drop a class. Shop some small classes like introsems and see if one sucks you in.",

Stanford is special because of the other students here and the flexibility you have to take so many different classes (partially because you never have to worry about getting into any core class).\n\nIf you're an optimizer, focus on your peers and introducing yourself to as many topics as you can.",

They burrow underground when the land is dry, and after enough rain falls to make a temporary body of water, they lay eggs.\n\n      \nAlso AFAIK it's not just environmental impact to wildlife and stream diversion that explain why Lag is no longer a reservoir (although that's a pretty good reason by itself). The sluice gate was damaged decades ago and never reapproved for repair. Plus the unfortunate spate of drownings (forced at least one frat to disband, if memory serves correctly).",

The d.school's primary purpose is to house the new Design major (the old product design major, which used to be under the mechanical engineering department). Anyone can take design courses, but the d.school is not an art school.",

            "comment": "Have you heard of Design Thinking or IDEO? One of the co-founders of IDEO (David Kelley) is also one of the founders of the d.school. The IDEO design agency is more like a consulting firm for innovation and entrepreneurship, than a traditional graphic design agency. They used the term \u201cdesign thinking\u201d to market their design consulting process. D.school was sort of founded to help spread the \u201cdesign thinking\u201d method. \n\nThe d.school doesn\u2019t grant any degrees. The classes are open for any undergrad or graduate students, from any department at Stanford, to apply for. There are a couple of core faculty but a lot of classes are co-taught by industry professionals. They all center on Design Thinking methodology but don\u2019t all require visual design.\n\nFor undergraduate students there is a Product Design major. It has changed a lot over the years. I think they\u2019re going through a major revamp right now to establish its own department, rather than being housed under Mechanical Engineering. You actually are not required to take d.school classes for the PD major. There are some dedicated PD core classes, they all focus heavily on design thinking. \n\nFor graduate students there is a small graduate design program, Design Impact. I think it has gone through a lot of changes over the years as well. It\u2019s very focused on entrepreneurship. The students they accept usually have very interdisciplinary backgrounds.",

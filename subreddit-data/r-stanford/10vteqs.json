    "postText": "My PoI mentioned over email and in a Zoom call after I accepted my PhD admission offer for Fall 2023 that I could come in early and start some research in their lab. They mentioned that they'd pay me during the summer if I  get there early before the department fellowship starts. I also have some financial security so I'm not terribly worried about money. \n\nHowever, I'm an international student and would like to get some idea about how to set things up for that. I am under the impression that an F1 student visa will allow me to enter the US a maximum of 30 days before the program start date. And fall term starts in the end of September while my PoI was mentioning June/July as a good time for me to come in. Housing is also one of my concerns. \n\nAny suggestions? Who would I have to contact regarding this? Is there anyone specific in the international student office that deals with this kind of stuff? I really would like to start early and one of the main reasons I applied to Stanford was for the opportunity to work with my PoI. Anybody else with a similar story?",

            "comment": "I wonder if there's a chance the research might be considered studies from a visa standpoint. That could change your start date, meaning you could obtain your visa sooner and arrive earlier. Maybe not though, if it's work rather than study. Either way, you should email a DSO in the international office, they will definitely have info for this. Good luck",

You just enroll in 3 credits of \u201cresearch\u201d over the summer (PI could pay for you or the department could) and I\u2019m guessing since you\u2019ll be matriculated you would count as a student for the visa",

            "comment": "I tried to do the same when I started my PhD. You can ask Bechtel for an early start, but you need your department to change the start date in your offer letter to one that allows you to be here in time for the summer. Once they do that, Bechtel will issue an I20 that aligns with the new start date.  \n\nMy rec is to talk with your person of contact at Bechtel, and get their advice first. My PI, as many other PIs, have zero clue about how migration works in the US.",

I do not regret that at all, and I am sure your PI would probably agree on that.\n\nPeople at Bechtel + my dept admin were really helpful and I am sure you will make if that's what you want.",

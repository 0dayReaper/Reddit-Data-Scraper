    "postText": "Hi folks! \n\nI was recently admitted to both Stanford and Berkeley for their physics PhD program, and I am seriously struggling to decide which one is a better fit. \n\nImportant considerations:\n- Academic quality of life: Stanford seems more \u201cchill\u201d \u2014 my department\u2019s quals are notoriously fine, the course requirements are less intense (and courses seem easier in general), and the rotation program allows people to explore. However, I come from a notoriously tough undergraduate institution, so Berkeley\u2019s intensity actually feels like a plus. Is it silly to be worried about getting a \u201cless rigorous\u201d graduate education at Stanford? For context, I plan to go into academia, so being well-trained is really important to me.\n- General quality of life: Palo Alto seems quite boring. I worry about feeling isolated. It also feels like the department is less active socially. I am queer and Berkeley is much much more active with graduate student affinity groups. Students feel more involved on a departmental level. And being in an urban environment is a plus. It feels like at Stanford, having hobbies outside the university is difficult without a car, and most people don\u2019t get into SF very often. \n- Stanford\u2019s stipend is higher (~8k per year higher than Berkeley), and both are in the Bay Area. But, it seems like cost of living in Palo Alto is also higher, so maybe that\u2019s less of a consideration?\n- Research/Advisor Fit: at Berkeley, I know who I would be working with and they feel like a fantastic advisor. I don\u2019t have a very clear direction at Stanford and would probably want to rotate through a few groups before deciding where to stay for my thesis research. Some of the groups I was considering have serious yellow flags, but there is at least one faculty member I think I could work with. \n\nI would appreciate any insights!!\n\nI feel like I hear a lot about Stanford vs Berkeley at the undergraduate level, and the consensus is usually that Stanford is more prestigious, better-resourced and takes care of its student more, but this may be less applicable as a graduate student (especially since Berkeley Physics is just as well-respected, if not more respected in some subfields, as Stanford).",

My advice is that is mostly about professors and research at PhD level (especially for physics).  \n\nTalk to current students at both schools.  Both excellent options.\n\nEdit:  I will also add Berkeley as a graduate student was pretty supportive, I think Berkeley gets a reputation as intense due to undergrad population (many weeder classes and pre-majors) by the time you get to graduate school they figure you are smart and stop trying to kick you out : ).  I do know people who switched between Berkeley and Stanford (MS at Berkeley, Phd at Stanford) mostly due to changing research interests but that is an unplanned situation.",

Almost to the degree of overriding all of your other concerns (beyond making sure that you are fundamentally comfortable as a human there, of course).\n\n&gt; However, I come from a notoriously tough undergraduate institution, so Berkeley\u2019s intensity actually feels like a plus.

But I don't think very many people (and certainly don't know any) emerge from PhD programs feeling that way.\n\nA PhD is really about taking you from being a knowledge \"ingester\" (where \"rigor\" can certainly help) to a knowledge \"emitter\" (where being self-directed is what matters).\n\n(From what you list, it sounds like Cal is a better choice for you!--but I wouldn't let concerns about \"rigor\" drive considerations.)",

I honestly wish I was at Cal every day...\n\nIs Berkeley that academically intense? I was under the impression it's just harder because you get less support. I thought I was going to Cal before here, and I remember the stark difference between sending an email and waiting a week at Cal, and any email I send here at Stanford to any administrator gets a reply within 24 hours. I appreciate that..\n\nI actually wouldn't doubt if Cal had better and more mental health support than Stanford does. The thing about here is that they really don't care. Maybe their dysfunctional program is affecting your mental health... What do they care? Why would they care? They have no motivation to change. At the end of the day, they still get to say they are Stanford and people will still come just for the name on the paper alone, just like I did.. Whatever those yellow flags are... listen to your gut.. \n\nBut, if I could go back in time, I think I would have made the same choice. It is Stanford.\n\nYou definitely need a car. I would die if I was isolated here in conformity-land, I get to visit my BF in SF often...\n\nIsn't a PhD like a million years? If the programs and your outcomes *are* similar, I think your mental health, happiness, and quality of life will be much better at Cal. I'm an hour away from any queer community event. Even San Jose is very limited, despite being a huge city. I'm voting you go to Cal. I'm miserable here and feel like a robot pretending to be something I'm not because being at Stanford on a fin aid package and not being grateful 100% of the time makes anyone feel a bit guilty.",

However as a Bay Area native, Berkeley is much more the vibe if you actually want to have fun so idk. I\u2019d worry about academic/environmental fit and also the stipend.

I would suggest considering rotating to find a good advisor. I think that working with someone who is caring and encouraging (and doing great research!) is more important than just doing exactly the kind of research that you find the most exciting. Your PhD will take a long time and many things can happen during that time, so you do want to have a mentor who can support you.",

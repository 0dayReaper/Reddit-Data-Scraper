    "postText": "Hi there, I\u2019m an incoming grad student and I was wondering what the best way is for incoming students to find potential housemates. I know the majority of grad students live on campus, but I\u2019d rather be able to bring my stuff with me and move in somewhere I prefer. I\u2019ve found a few options already, I\u2019m just hoping to find housemates who\u2019d be willing to go about the process together! Thanks! \n\nAlso, if you want to link up here just send me a DM and we can chat!",

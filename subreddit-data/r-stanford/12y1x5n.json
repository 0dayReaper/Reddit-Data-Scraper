    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m an incoming grad student and I am interested in listing the EV studios as my first choice in the housing application. Just wanted to see if anyone could tell me what their experience was in the space.\n\nFor context, I value privacy more than having a massive space, but I\u2019m also in my late 20s and have been living in a pretty spacious 2 bed apartment with a housemate for about 3 years. I am very adaptable and can make the most out of very little because of my childhood, but I have had bad roommate situations twice before and I\u2019d rather not set myself up for a headache- I\u2019m international and it\u2019s too much of a gamble to try pair with a roommate- might consider it later on. Thank you!\n\nP/s my worst case scenario choice is the 2 bed 2 bath.",

            "comment": "I lived with my partner in Studio 6. It's small --- 375 sq ft IIRC. (Stanford considers EV studios to be \"couples housing\"...) Way too small for two people, would not recommend that. For one person, it should be alright. The biggest issue we had was smells/oils from the kitchen getting all over the room. We installed a curtain that divided the kitchen from the bedroom, and that helped a bit.\n\nAnother big help was convincing R&amp;DE to move the massive desk out of the room. That thing was HUGE. It freed up a lot of space, at least enough for my partner and I to co-work in the room. They were reluctant (it was against some policy), but with enough pestering our building manager was willing to make an exception.\n\nI have several friends who've lived solo in the EV studios, and they enjoyed their time AFAIK.\n\nIf you can afford a car, another option is to move off-campus. We currently live in Mountain View and we love it. Our current place is 3x larger than the studio, and it costs the same! But you do have to commute to work.",

Will consider off campus housing after my first year as I\u2019m international and would like to get a lay of the land first. Thanks again!",

Along those lines, it was perfect for me and I really appreciated having my own space right on campus, while still being easy to socialize with everyone else. It was worth the added money (for me/at that time) versus off campus options. I found it to be plenty of room for me and my stuff. I even hosted weekend visitors without a problem.",

            "comment": "I'm wondering if the EV studios have sufficient soundproofing, considering that many residents might have pets, overnight guests, musical instruments, etc. If the studios aren't adequately sound-proofed, it could potentially be worse than being randomly assigned to roommates in a 2b2b scenario, where at least you'd have the opportunity to communicate and address any issues.",

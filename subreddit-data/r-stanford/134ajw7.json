    "postText": "I'm thinking of going to Stanford and I have a few questions before I commit. I am interested in the political science/econ/public policy field but I'm weary about the resources and opportunities offered. I know Stanford is very stem and so I am a bit worried that the humanities department might not match up. If there's anyone here who studies those majors, please lmk your experience, the things and skills you've gained. Thanks!",

Those departments don\u2019t get the same headlines as STEM, but they are vital to the academic community. \n\nTons of Poli Sci majors attend Stanford in Washington for networking and experience in DC.\n\nI\u2019m from California, so Stanford is a no-brainer for picking best college on the west coast.",

            "comment": "Stanford\u2019s polisci/Econ is as good as anywhere in the country, even if the community is smaller than the stem one. If you\u2019re interested in foreign policy you won\u2019t be at a meaningful disadvantage compared to the Ivies, distance be damned. Econ tends neoclassical and I think the core classes are meh, but this is probably true of most places. Some of the field courses/electives are fantastic. Less familiar with Polisci but there are great classes in that department too. Most profs are neoliberal (eg Fukuyama) but this is true of literally any school.\n\nThe deciding element in where you go should be other lifestyle factors, because opportunities are plenty for PoliSci/Econ people here.",

            "comment": "I'm going to start my answer by copy-and-pasting my response to a prior similar question:\n\n&gt;I had zero interest in being a STEM major (my dad majored in CS at another college). I had a wonderful time as a PoliSci-History double major.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In PoliSci, I had profs who were former presidential advisors and Cabinet Secretaries. In History, I learned from Pulitzer Prize winners.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I learned about US-Iranian relations from a prof who had fascinating stories about his time in Iran under the Shah and the Ayatollah before coming to America.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A Pulitzer Prize-winning history prof who's one of the country's leading constitutional scholars I had was so attentive to his students that one day when I arrived for class, he asked me about a comment I had made in a Stanford Daily story several days earlier about the ASSU (Stanford's student government).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Oh yeah, the history double major was by accident. I took so many history electives for fun that I had nearly finished all the requirements for it, so I declared it midway through senior year and finished two classes Spring Quarter of senior year to fulfill the remaining requirements and graduate on-time in 4 years.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I took only 3 STEM classes in my entire time at Stanford.\n\nI've spent my career in the field (as a practitioner, not an academic), and the critical thinking, research, and communications skills have been helpful.\n\nOne fun story I have from an undergraduate PoliSci class on judicial politics and federalism: prof assigned us a Supreme Court opinion (I forget if it was a concurrence or a dissent, but that detail doesn't matter for this purpose), but he removed the name of the justice who wrote it.  We came back to the next class to discuss what we had read.  The progressive students praised the opinion, and the conservative students attacked the opinion.  After a bit, the prof revealed it was written by Justice Antonin Scalia.  You could hear a pin drop as progressives realized they were praising something written by the leading conservative justice and conservatives realized they were attacking something written by the leading conservative justice.  The lesson then, which I find even more valuable today (considering how polarized things are now), was that we should always evaluate ideas on their merits, not on based on who the messenger is.  Had the prof revealed it was a Scalia opinion from the start, most (if not all) the students in the class would have made the opposite arguments that they made.\n\nMultiple students I knew from my time at Stanford are now elected officials, and a bunch of us work in the PoliSci/Public Policy arena but aren't politicians.\n\n(Of less relevance, I will note that US News &amp; World Report polled department heads across the country about graduate programs, and [Stanford is ranked #1 for PoliSci in the country](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/political-science-rankings) and [Stanford is in a three-way tie as #1 for Econ in the country](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/economics-rankings).)\n\nP.S. Stanford is still top 3 for producing Members of Congress, and while we're down now, we used to have half the Supreme Court justices.",

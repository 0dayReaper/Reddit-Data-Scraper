    "postText": "Hope it\u2019s ok to ask for this sort of advice and that this is relevant.\nI\u2019m going to be a freshman at Stanford for \u201827 (if I don\u2019t withdraw or something) and I feel very afraid. It\u2019s awkward being so honest, but I hope it\u2019s relevant to others. Ik there are other ppl who feel like they\u2019re not worthy of Stanford or shouldn\u2019t have gotten in and stuff, but I\u2019m worried because I don\u2019t really have much drive or ambition or goals. I\u2019m super(!) lucky that my parents are ok paying for it but it feels like a waste on me and that I\u2019ll be really out of place. I feel like I got into Stanford because of my mom being passionate and driven and driving me to do stuff\u2026 I know it\u2019s not the whole truth but still. And I think I have a sort of superiority complex from being at a small school and feeling special/smart when actually I\u2019m very average and sometimes dumb? I know I have low self esteem, but I think without outside pressure I have very average passions, though I try hard in what I do. I\u2019ve been on a gap year and have really struggled with mental health like depression, social anxiety, and motivation, so I\u2019m worried academically (and socially) as well\u2026 like it\u2019s hard for me to get myself fill out paperwork and research classes and stuff\u2026\n\nDoes anyone relate?\nWill I be ok? Are there accommodations people recommend? Is it ok for people not to be very driven or proactive? Am I not right for Stanford? \nNot sure if this makes sense, but I\u2019d love advice or comments",

            "comment": "If you are suffering from depression, some of the ways you are feeling about yourself could be really coming from the depression itself. Even though you do not feel that you are worthy, I am sure that you are a unique amazing person. Having depression, make you see the world through dark color glasses, that make everything seem worse than it actually is. If you want to read an amazing book about this whole experience, you can read the book, the noonday demon by Andrew Solomon.  If this describes you, it would be important to try to get treatment as soon as possible as the treatments take several weeks to work.\nIf this is not the depression, speaking, and you are afraid that you will get lost among super achievers, I can assure you that there are many normal, kind people at Stanford, who are feeling the same as you. They see the headlines about Olympic athletes and start up founders and ask themselves do I belong there. I can say definitely that you do. Just open yourself up to your future classmates and future friends and you\u2019ll find that they will give you lots of love and support in return.",

I\u2019m sure some of the imposter stuff is not just depression but stuff I\u2019ll have to work through in this coming school year and onward. Are people transparent about mental health struggles and stuff? I assume it\u2019s getting much less stigmatized, but I could still imagine not many people talking about it? Thanks for the kind, supportive words and wonderful advice, yes I\u2019m working on it with therapy. I\u2019ll def read the book!",

I was first-gen, lower-middle class, and really had no business at Stanford academically. \n\nIt was a rough 4 years, but I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything. I eventually became an employee at the university and worked on campus for 7 years after graduation.\n\nThere are support systems in place for people like us. Plenty of fuzzy non-CS, non-pre med students mixed in. I was not particularly driven or ambitious. You can treat Stanford like any other college. It is a great environment for reflection and exploration.",

The fact that you had a little bit of good fortune by being accepted to \ud83c\udf32is being convoluted by your teenage brain into some kind of injustice to others.   It's nothing like that.

Depression does demotivate people but not all individuals who are unmotivated to do things, like study at Stanford, are depressed. Were you actually diagnosed with depression or is this a self-diagnosis? \n\n\n2. You\u2019re right that if you\u2019re not motivated to do well here that you won\u2019t. Your mom can\u2019t plan and live your life for you forever. Dropping out is not common here but there are tons of kids like you at other schools who drop out, or otherwise fail to live up to the expectations their parents have set for them, once they are away from home and their parents can\u2019t hold their hands.\n\n\nThat said, OP, you\u2019re already in. If you need mental health help, get it. Come and try a few classes. You might find a passion (or maybe you verify it\u2019s not for you and you can leave. That\u2019s fine, too. You also don\u2019t have to *love* what you do, by the way. Not everyone has a vocation and that\u2019s totally fine.)",

I think it\u2019s a mixture of low mood/interest and not being very driven. \n\nHmm I think I\u2019ll try hard in what I do like classes and stuff, it\u2019s just I\u2019m not sure I have the capacity to be proactive, which you\u2019re saying isn\u2019t super necessary (as in you don\u2019t have to be super driven or passionate?). Yeah it\u2019s hard to tell if this is more of a personality/character trait where Stanford might not be the right fit/timing or if this is just a slump where I can figure out goals and purpose while in school. Ig the main issue then is if I\u2019ll be up to college in general (as in have the capacity to function)?\n\nAnyways thanks a lot for the insights!",

    "postText": "I know that technically this option is supposed to be for grad students only, but I'd like to take it for 3 since I'm out of unit space.  If I just enrolled for 3 units when I sign up for spring courses would anyone care/check? I would be taking 22 units so I'd have to the stupid \"advisor check in\" thing so maybe during that, but idk how close they're going to scrutinize it\n\nOr has anyone had luck emailing the prof of other classes w/ 3 unit grad enrollment options to get permission to take the class for fewer units?",

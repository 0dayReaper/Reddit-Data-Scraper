    "postText": "I got into CMU'S MSR program and Stanford's MS EE program (ML, control track). CMU is better known for robotics and most MSR students get funding and it is a research based masters whereas Stanford is a non-thesis based masters. Considering all the factors funding, location, opportunities etc. which would be a better choice. I wish to work in the industry (research roles) in the future. And not sure about doing a PhD but might go for one.\n\nAny response is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

Your choice should depend on future goals, and whether a PI would be interested in working with you here. Even if you end up going to industry, a research based masters is much more valuable than a non-research based masters. I had a friend who is currently working as a ML engineer at Amazon, and he said that his team was impressed that he had a publication, and they allowed him to enter at a higher level.",

I would plan on doing a PhD after your MS if that's really what you want, which you can pull off at either school.\n\nThat said, in my experience most people who \"want industry research roles\" really mean \"I want to stay creative but also get paid\". If that's you, ML  software is increasingly commoditized and fast-paced - the \"import python package\" crowd is usually only 6mo-2yr behind the cutting edge - so you don't need a PhD to get an interesting job.\n\nI was personally very impressed by Stanford EE ML/control - EE364A is probably the famous course at Stanford outside of CS (at least in my circles lol). Several EE profs feel they did ML before ML was cool ;o",

TA is timeboxed (lead TA is a job, others can be &lt;10hr/week) so most people lean that way. That does mean 60-80+hr/week commitments with competing deadlines, up to you if that's worth it to achieve your goals.\n\nFor most (all?) departments, you can fill up electives with research units. Most departments will support a \\~9-unit thesis. A lot of students use these to dive deeper in a subfield and it ends up being kinda like self-directed courses with the thesis as a proof of work.\n\nStanford is very flexible (if you're not asking for resources) and you can probably work out w/e with your advisor upon arriving.",

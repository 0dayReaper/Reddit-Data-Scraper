It's something that you can learn on the job or on your own. Coursework is just a helpful way to get there. SIG fellowships IIRC do not have strict recommendations for coursework taken. I remember applying for some SIG opportunities and none of them ever asked me about coursework.\n\nI believe what is most relevant are your experiences. For instance, I interned with the Council of Economic Advisors despite having only taken 2 intro econ courses because I had relevant experiences such as economic research, extracurriculars, side projects, strong recommendations, and previous internship experience.",

    "postText": "Hi! I am a senior at a big state school studying computer science. I visited the Stanford campus once and have always wondered what it would be like to study computer science there. I am from the east coast, so I do not live anywhere near silicon valley and I don't have access to a market of investors nearby to pitch to. I have this idea in my head that it is so much easier to make a startup in Stanford due to its proximity from so many tech companies and venture capitalists, though I don't know how true that is.\n\nSo I have some questions and I was wondering if there's any computer science undergrad or graduate students that wouldn't mind sharing their experience studying at Stanford?\n\nSome questions that come to mind:\n\n\\- How easy would you say is it to find investors, other students to work with, and funding for an idea or project that you're working on to develop it into a startup?\n\n\\- What projects do you create throughout your time at Stanford?\n\n\\- How are your classes? Do you feel they are difficult? Do you feel like you learn a lot from them? Do you feel your professors are good?\n\n\\- Is there a senior project at some point? If so, how does it work? What sorts of collaborative projects do you do throughout your academic career?\n\n\\- How has your experience been like finding internships? Is it easy getting an internship? How many places do you apply? Do Stanford connections help you get into a company easier?\n\n\\- How has your networking experience been? Is it easy to get in contact with people at companies or places you want to work at? Is it easy to get funding from Stanford? Is it easy to get a meeting with investors/venture capitalists from around the Stanford area?\n\nAny responses would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advanced!",

I live in grad housing on-campus and want to adopt a dog when the quarter ends \u2014 I\u2019m wondering if anyone could share experiences about how to go about getting the letter from a doctor and maneuvering through R&amp;D bureaucracy?",

            "comment": "General dog advice: If you expect your current work load to stay at this level, taking care of a dog may be difficult. Consider where your dog will be while you're in class/lab/office hours/away. Grad housing may not be enough room, and bored dogs can easily become destructive dogs. What happens if your dog barks a lot and disturbs other people in the area? What happens if your dog is anxious around strangers? Do you have easy access to a place for the dog to go to the bathroom? You also might consider classmates and colleagues that are allergic or are nervous around dogs.  \n\n\nI don't know if these alternatives apply to you, but I had a classmate who signed up as a dog sitter on Rover and another who was a regular dog walker for her professor. They both said that the dedicated time with the pups were great for their emotional needs, they didn't have the responsibility of full-time care, and they got paid!",

If you just want a dog and do not need one, your abuse of this process will just make it harder for people with legitimate need for ESA or service dogs in the future.",

You basically sign up with OAE, get an advisor, fill out some e-forms saying why the esa will help you (just repeat whats in your letter) and then they approve you. Then after that, RDE will assign you to available ESA approved housing which i think is all graduate residences.",

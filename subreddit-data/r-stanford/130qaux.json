    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm an incoming graduate student and I'm contemplating whether to apply for housing with another person. Based on your experiences, does applying as a group significantly affect our chances of getting popular housing options like 2b2b or studios? I'm wondering if it might be easier for an individual to be placed in a room that already has an occupant, as opposed to finding an entirely vacant room.\n\nI found some information on the R&amp;DE website stating, \"There is no guarantee that all members will be assigned to the same residence, or to the same apartment within a residence. During winter and spring quarters when wholly vacant apartments are rarely available, you are likely to be split between residences.\" It also seems that roommate pairing and residence/apartment assignment occurs after the housing type has been assigned. Based on this, I assume that applying for housing as a group only ensures the same lottery number is assigned to the group, so our chances of getting popular options should remain the same. Am I interpreting this correctly?\n\nI appreciate any insights you can provide based on your experiences. Additionally, I'd be grateful if anyone could share the \"worst\" housing situation a first-year student might be assigned. Thanks in advance!",

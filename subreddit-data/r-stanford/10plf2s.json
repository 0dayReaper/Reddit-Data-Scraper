    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am looking to sublet my 2Bed place in Rains Graduate Housing for the Spring quarter (March 24th - June 25th) if anyone knows of Stanford affiliates that are looking for on-campus housing during that term please feel free to reach out!  \n\n\nDetails: It would be 1 bedroom in a 2B in the renovated part of rains. Fully furnished. Shared bathroom with 1 roommate. Cost would be the same as what I pay for student housing ($1445 per month, everything included). See video for tour: https://rde.stanford.edu/stude.../liliore-green-rains-houses  \n\n\nIt is in the newly renovated part of Rains, and a great location to meet social Stanford students! Please respond to this posting if interested or email me at \\[vilkhu AT stanford DOT edu\\]!",

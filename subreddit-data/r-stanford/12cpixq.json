    "postText": "Got into Stanford REA but also received a full-tuition scholarship from Emory. I'm so grateful to have these two amazing options, but feeling very conflicted.\n\n* Stanford is full cost to attend, while Emory would only be the cost of room and board ($20k/yr). Additionally, my parents are willing to contribute $55k/yr towards Stanford but I'd have to cover the other $25k/year with student loans. I'm waiting to hear back from a few private scholarships but will probably have to decide before I get those results (and they're not crazy significant amounts of money).\n* If I went to Stanford, I'd explore economics, political science, and earth systems, but I'm not dead-set on anything. The Emory scholarship program is actually contingent on me doing business, so I'd probably do a double major with business and political science.\n* I really like Emory, and after attending their scholarship finalist weekend, I think I could be really happy there. Additionally, scholars receive some nice perks and access to speciality advising and things like that. Still, Stanford is Stanford and it's hard for me to turn down that level of prestige/name recognition.\n\nI know that this is ultimately a personal decision, but any input would be appreciated. I'm going to Admit weekend and am hoping that will help me decide, since I haven't yet visited Stanford when there are students on campus.",

Presumably/hopefully you had some specific reasons for applying besides \"Stanford is Stanford.\"\n\nGlad to hear you're going to visit btw, and when it's in session. Lean into that experience and then go with your gut.\n\nCongrats on two wonderful options!",

I like Stanford's location/campus, proximity to family, the strength of the programs that I'm interested in (but also flexibility where I'll have room to explore different things), amazing faculty, and great guest speakers/performers (I saw that Yo-Yo Ma was there this week and that Malala came a few months ago). Also ethnic theme housing like Ujamaa and D1 sports/school spirit. But I know some of these things are also present at Emory and I don't *really* know what Stanford is like since I've never been when students are on campus. So yeah, I do think the visit will be pretty pivotal in my decision.",

It will be easier to get into the \"best\" (=highest-paying) careers from Stanford (although certainly can and does happen from Emory).  $100k is a *lot* of money, but, if you're not a spendthrift (and doesn't sound like you are), you will be able to pay it down pretty quickly.\n\nIf you're more interested in, e.g., public sector or \"professional\" grad school (med, law, or a PhD), then I'd go Emory, since you really, really, really don't want that loan burden and the grad school matters far more than your undergrad.  \n\n(Yes, public school loan forgiveness exists.  No, it isn't very good.)\n\nIf you're not sure, go Emory--you don't want to artificially constrain your future options.",

That's rough - it really does constrain what you can do with your UG. But Emory has some pretty innovative split majors, like you can do PoliSci and Math together as a single major on top of a first major in the b-school.\nOn the other hand, taking out $100k in loans *also* constrains what you can do. Wanna get a PhD in poli sci? Entry level Assistant Profs/Consultants are gonna struggle a lot with that debt load (even if you do income based repayment with public service forgiveness). You will need to take entry level income into account with every decision.\nIf this was a university rather than college-level scholarship, I think this would be an easy nod to Emory. Even with the restrictions, though, Atlanta is awesome, Emory has what you need, and debt free you can do literally anything upon graduation (even if you have to spend 3.5 years convincing people that public opinion polling and market research are the same thing).

If you are even remotely considering a career in finance/consulting/tech, then absolutely go to Stanford (assuming that is the case since the Emory scholarship is for its business program?). The cost difference will pay for itself after the first ~5 years post-college, and it will only continue to widen as you progress in your career (assuming you play your cards right - don\u2019t bomb grades, network well, interview decently, etc.). There\u2019s a ton of early career advantages at Stanford that Emory just won\u2019t provide you with (don\u2019t get me wrong, Emory is still a very good school)\u2026 (fwiw, if the full ride were to Duke/UChicago/etc. then I would tell you to choose the full ride). \n\nMy best friend\u2019s brother faced this dilemma a few years ago and chose a full ride at a T25-30 School over Stanford. He is doing well overall, but imo his net earnings (ie. cumulative salary less tuition) 5 years post-college would\u2019ve been ~$350k more (probably more) if he went to Stanford and had access to those early career opportunities (which really sets you up for your first 2-3 jobs post-college), not to mention the alumni network lift in mid-to-late career. Separately, one of my best friends went to a top LAC (Williams/Amherst/Swarthmore) over UPenn for the same reason and to this day she regrets her decision.\n\nEdit: Just saw that you only need to cover $25k/year in student loans, which makes this a no brainer imo. For reference, entry level tier 1 Wall Street and SWE jobs pay ~$200k first year post-college and that doubles after 3 years or so (not sure about tech, but yes for finance). That said, if you have ABSOLUTELY 0 INTEREST in pursuing the fields above and are more interested in grad school (academia/med school/law school/etc.), then save yourself some money and go to Emory.",

If you want to live off campus you can without feeling like you're paying a fortune for a shoebox.It's still expensive but not astronomically so. \n\nI believe Emory has a partnership with other colleges in the Atlanta area. There could be classes at GA Tech of interest to your field that you could take.\n\nYou could try for Stanford for grad school if you were still interested then.",

Major might matter a bit more in determining your final path, but what you learn in your major does not.\n\nIf you and your best friend who went to a lesser-known college is applying to the same job, your resume will get looked at first. You could very well flunk the interview and your friend might ace it and get the job instead of you. But prestige helps you out of the starting block. \n\nThe fact that your friend who went to a lessor-known school is doing just as well as you probably means he's working a little bit harder than you (or is smarter, better looking, better social skills, or whatever).

    "postText": "Hi,  \nI'm subletting my premium studio (Kennedy, Hastorf) for the summer. June 1 - Aug 1. Can extend to September 1 as well. The space is 439 sq.ft.\n\n[https://rde.stanford.edu/studenthousing/kennedy-graduate-residences](https://rde.stanford.edu/studenthousing/kennedy-graduate-residences) \\[premium studio\\]\n\nIt's one the larger studios available on Stanford Campus. Fully furnished and stocked with standing desk, monitor, instant pot, microwave, vacuum, bidet, and extra storage space. Official rent charged by Stanford is 2308.  \nHappy to give an in person or virtual tour!\n\nStanford affiliates only, sadly. You'd need ID to access.",

    "postText": "First, I wanted to congratulate you all and express how excited I am to meet the class of 2025. For those of you who don\u2019t know me yet, my name is Antonio Milane, and I have a disability called Cerebral Palsy. It is a neurological disability that affects my muscles throughout my body. I can not use my hands properly and require a scribe to complete my schoolwork. At the moment, Stanford is not willing to provide me a scribe for my schoolwork as they believe it is a \u201cpersonal preference\u201d instead of a necessity. They are only willing to accommodate a scribe where there is limited use of the accommodation, such as tests and labs. This does not include homework and classwork where a scribe would actually be needed. I will not be able to attend Stanford if I do not get this scribe. If you could please share this with whoever you can, it would mean the world to me. My Instagram is antonio\\_milane; please dm me on there if you have any questions or follow for more information.",

As for assignments, the overwhelming majority of assignments are done electronically, and my understanding is that many students who have difficulties with using their hands have electronic methods of typing things up.",

Genuinely wondering if you thought about this suggestion for more than a minute before you posted.\n\nEDIT: I was a bit wrong about this as it seems text to speech is the go to option. I was misinformed because i misremembered my experiences with OAE. My apologies for coming off so strong",

This is what my friend received at a different institution.",

I have seen scribes when I was an undergrad in certain classes for students (mostly athletes) who had injuries.

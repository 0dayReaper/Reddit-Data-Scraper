It still exists but has been renamed to 212. \n\n212 (previously called 140) can be taken as one class, or it can be taken separately as two classes. \n\nCS 111 is the coursework (exams and hw) part of 212, 112 is the projects (which are substantial). These can be taken separately and whenevet you want. \n\nIf you take 212 instead of 111+112 you are taking essentially both parts at the same time (ie. in the same quarter) - and this is identical to what was once called 140.\n\nThe reasoning behind the change of name is that the class can be very hard and the numbering/structure now reflects that.",

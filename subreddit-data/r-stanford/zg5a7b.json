    "postText": "So I've been admitted to the Aero/Astro Masters HCP (Part time student program) - The programs FAQ specifies the degree cannot be completed online and I was hoping I could get some insight into any current or past HCP student's on-campus experiences.  For any classes not taken through the Stanford Center for Professional Development, did you have to commute to campus 2-3 times a week during business hours? Were lectures recorded?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, I did some comparison between the courses offered online through SCPD and the degree requirements, and as far as I can tell the listed course codes seem sufficient to fulfill all of the degree requirements. Am I misinterpreting something? Does the FAQ specify the degree can't be completed online due to shifting course offerings or something like that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny insights would be greatly appreciated",

            "comment": "I am in the EE HCP program and am currently remote and I can confirm that it is not really possible to do the whole degree remotely and this is probably true for Aero, too. The course offerings from SCPD are pretty limited each quarter (just because SCPD lists a course as a possibility does not mean it will be offered. e.g., SCPD lists EE264 as a possible course, but is not offering it in winter quarter. Stanford, as a whole, is only offering EE264 for winter quarter... Thus, the course will not be offered by SCPD at all this year.)",

If you're a full-time working engineer I think you'll find 1 class per quarter is more than enough to keep you occupied, though, so I expect you'd only need to commute 2x/week.",

            "comment": "I am doing a certificate program though the Stanford SCPD and am looking into one of their MS programs.  What I found may help and may be why they say you can't complete the entire MS in A&amp;A online.\n\nIt seems that some (many?) of the courses listed on the SCPD website are not offered on a regular basis.  So for the MS program I am looking at 2 of the courses I need to take were last offered online in 2020 and it isn't clear when they'll be offered online again.  So part of the issue may be that if you want to get the degree completed in a reasonable time (for example 2-3 years) all the courses you need might not be offered online during that window of time.\n\nIf that is something that is a concern, another option would be to look at another online MS program.  Purdue has an excellent MS in Aero/Astro that can be completed all online and from a reputation perspective Purdue is in the same class as Stanford.  There are also other options like USC which are a step below but offer excellent programs.",

The key is to ask your manager if this is okay with them and to manage your commitments accordingly.\n\nRegardless of whether or not the lectures were recorded or not, I found that interacting with folks in person made for more productive discussions and I was able to make some new friends/colleagues each quarter as a result.\n\nEdit: 2-3 times a week, not a day.

    "postText": "Summer housing for students, even visiting students in Stanford Summer programs pay less than 3k for 8-weeks of summer housing. A university student doing an internship at SLAC for two months, and the housing is over 7k. Is that for real, or did we do something wrong? And it's just a room, not even with a kitchen. \n\nSeparate question: Will be looking for other options. Does anyone know what is a reasonable commuting distance via public transport or bike or foot for getting to/from SLAC. What areas, parts of towns would work? For biking, is the area super hilly?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights.",

Check out the map here and the schedule for SLAC.   \n[https://transportation.stanford.edu/marguerite](https://transportation.stanford.edu/marguerite)  \n\n\nFrom town to SLAC has some rolling hills, but most of us around here don't count that as \"hilly.\" But if you bike past SLAC to the west, you can get into some real climbs.\n\nAs for where to live, that is the eternal struggle. You should be able to find a  bedroom for 8 weeks that's more reasonable than 7k. Maybe someone will sublet over summer. Good luck. I wish I had better info on this.",

Ask the SLAC admin or Stanford ResEd for clarification.\n\nIt\u2019s not crazy hilly but as a student commuting there on a bike in the morning in Palo Alto summer is enough of a struggle to be inconvenient. It\u2019s usually best to take the marguerite. Door to door it shouldn\u2019t be more than 30 minutes.",

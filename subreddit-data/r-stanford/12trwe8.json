I've only watched Youtube recordings so far, but I'd love to attend the events in person as I'm living in the Bay Area. Unfortunately I couldn't find the schedules. Does anyone know how where should I look into?\n\nThis is the webpage of the program. Thanks for the help.\n\nhttps://www.gsb.stanford.edu/experience/learning/guest-speakers/view-top",

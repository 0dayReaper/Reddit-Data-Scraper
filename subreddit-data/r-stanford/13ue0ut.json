    "postText": "I got into the master\u2019s aero/Astro program at Stanford and my plan up until last week was to go. I accepted, filled out housing, etc. However, a recruiter from a dream company of mine emailed me last week asking if I was still interested. I had applied in January, so way before I accepted my Stanford offer. \n\nI know the aero/Astro program has an online/part-time option for people that are working through something called the Honors Cooperative Program. I\u2019ve been sending emails back and forth to the company HR and the departments administration. I\u2019m basically asking the department to see if it\u2019s possible to switch from an incoming full time student to a part time, online one so I can at least interview for the position, and if I get it, take it without having to compromise my degree. And I\u2019m asking the company HR if that would be acceptable. The people at the department havent been getting back to me that quick, and when they have, they just told me that a program exists to do what I\u2019m trying to do. Nothing really about if I can make that switch.\n\nI guess I\u2019m posting to see if anyone can provide me with some clarity in a case like this. Has anyone been in a similar situation? If so, what did you do? Is there anything I\u2019m not doing that I should be to make this happen? Working and doing my degree part time would by far be the ideal scenario for me financially and for family reasons, so I\u2019m trying my best to make this happen. Thanks in advance",

            "comment": "I was in a similar situation, it should be pretty straightforward to switch to HCP and vice-versa. I\u2019d go through the interview as normal and figure it out if you get an offer. If you do and you decide to do both at the same time, I\u2019m sure someone at Stanford can help switch you to HCP.\n\nI am graduating this June, I did the MS EE through HCP while working full time so lmk if you have any questions. Just be aware that it\u2019s a different experience than doing it on campus. It\u2019s much harder to get to know other students and get involved with professors and their research. It\u2019ll mostly just be completing courses. The courses are awesome (at least compared to my state school undergrad courses) so still worth it imo but it\u2019s very tough to do it while working.",

Be aware that you\u2019ll be working 60+ hour weeks for at least the next 2.5 years.\n\nAlthough I do wish I went on campus sometimes, maybe it will still be worth it that I did it part time. I gained 3 years work exp and was getting full time, big tech SWE salary during that time too. The cost of me doing it on campus instead of taking the job and doing the degree part time would have been well into the 6 figures.",

I wouldn\u2019t push the issues with the company, beyond asking if they do tuition reimbursement or have equivalent policies. \n\nDepending on your field, you\u2019re learn a lot more in you job than in grad school, even at Stanford.",

            "comment": "I do not know the specifics of your program but I can assure you that Stanford is VERY accommodating to students. But the staff --again broadly speaking -- dislikes hypotheticals. IF you get the job, write a proposal/petition requesting your ideal scenario, with persuasive justifications, and email it to the admin director and the department chair. They will then respond in specific ways. Right now, your situation has too many unknowns to get a clear response. But the fact that there is already a program that addresses a lot of your worry means that you are not the first person to have this situation and that they will likely try to work things out.",

I was thinking it would be immature to go through the interview and get an offer just to get it denied by Stanford and then having to turn it down. It\u2019s probably more reasonable to have an offer on the table before asking for accommodations. Thanks!",

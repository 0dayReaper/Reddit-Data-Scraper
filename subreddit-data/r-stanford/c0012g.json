This time, facilities won\u2019t disclose why there\u2019s not enough chilled water capacity. You\u2019d think that the geniuses that came up with and installed this truly groundbreaking system would do the necessary maintenance in the cooler weather, but nope.",

People reference how the average temperature in the Bay Area is so moderate and comfortable in order to justify not having air conditioning, and I look at the weather history and it repeatedly hits 80+ degrees every year, and I just fail to understand the justification.  A building that is in the sun will be hot inside even if the outside temp is only 75-80 degrees.",

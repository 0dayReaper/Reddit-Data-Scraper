            "comment": "He is NOT!\n\nPeople just love to see others fail, it's one of the more disgusting truths of mankind, alas if you throw enough mud at a wall, some will stick...\n\nNow to the facts, Huberman is not perfect, I'm sorry to disappoint some, he is a human being with his own flaws not some kind of supreme entity. He invests a lot of time into giving away information for free, much of which is very useful to a lot of people, apparently. He has to make money somehow, surprise surprise.\n\nComing to inaccurate scientific evidence, well I think there may be some truth to that but this should not come as a surprise to anyone. He releases his podcasts at a frequency of 1/w I think, covering widely different fields from his own. Nobody is able to do a proper literature review in such a short time. So he likely has people that help him but also they may be wrong sometimes. Maybe he should put more of a disclaimer on topics he is no expert in and has no respective guests on board.\n\nAnother part of this is that often there is not ONE single consensus in a field (and this is a good thing). Especially when it comes to health, there is incredible inter-human variability, what helps some may not do anything to someone else and even harm a third person. This is, by the way, the reason why the notion of precision medicine has been drawing so much attention in the past few years.\n\nI would assume he could do a better job in warning people about this but calling him a con artist is more than just absurd.",

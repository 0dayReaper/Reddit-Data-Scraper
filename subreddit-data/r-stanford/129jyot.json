What should I know about Stanford and/or the ME department, and what should I do or not do during my time here? Is there anything specific I should bring from home (international student here)? Thank you for any and all advice!",

On campus housing is the best option (and affordable).   \nI know people like to say how \"unaffordable\" it is, but you aren't buying a house in Palo Alto ;-)  you are living in Stanford subsidized housing. As an example, you can get very nice housing on campus (such as EVGR) that is $1500 per month.",

Also, there are pop-up food pantries at EVGR every month or so that can help with getting food more cheaply. Also, you can use the website [supost.com](https://supost.com) if you need something - stanford affiliates can use it to sell things or advertise housing. Also, I'm not sure if it's open to grad students but Roble Reuse has clothes and other supplies that students leave when they move out that you can have for free.",

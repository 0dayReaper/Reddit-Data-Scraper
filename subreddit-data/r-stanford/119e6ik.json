I would love to work at Stanford as the job seems quite interesting, but, I was wondering if it is possible to ask for a higher pay grade (example J or K) when interviewing or is it pretty much set in stone with the job title.",

When I got my offer they told me the full range of the grade and I just asked for the max, they offered me within $10k of the max with a $5k sign on bonus the first year.",

What is the annual raise policy (i.e., 4% to keep up with inflation)?\n\nHappy to also chat over DM.",

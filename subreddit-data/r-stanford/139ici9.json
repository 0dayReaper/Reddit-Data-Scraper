It took me about a quarter to find a job I liked.\n\nAlso, don't get a job immediately, get used to Stanford and life in the US first imho :)",

Hope you spend some wonderful 4 years there :)\r  \n\r  \nI applied as an international transfer student from Greece, but unfortunately wasn't lucky enough this time :(\r  \n\r  \nI would love to discuss with you, if you don't have an issue with that, how you approached the application process, and learn more about how you presented your competitive personal advantage, in order to make myself a better candidate the next time!\r  \n\r  \nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m going to visit Stanford for 2 weeks for a research internship and will stay at the guest house. How much money do I need for this timespan in regards of food? I live in Zurich so I am used to expensive supermarket prices but I\u2019d like to get an estimate. Thank you!",

            "comment": "\\+1 on mickman\\_10's answer for $50-$100 a week for groceries.   \nI also agree on $12-$15 on dining out PER meal at Ray's Grill or Coupa or Blend or standard on-campus cafes. The number could go much higher if you eat out at a higher-than-average restaurant though (not necessarily a fancy one), say at Downtown Palo Alto or California Ave.   \nIf you get a Stanford affiliate account, you can sign up for 25 meal blocks on Stanford RDE website. You get a block of 25 lunch coupons or 25 dinner coupons or 25 coupons for any meal. Per meal, I think lunch goes for $11-ish and Dinner goes for $12-ish using that 25 meal block deal.   \nThat will give you access to several Stanford dining halls like Arillaga or Lakeside among others.  \n\n\nIf you're going to be here during Spring, there will probably be many events with free food that you can sign up for, which is something some people do.   \n\n\nIf you're only going to be here for two weeks, a standard expectation is that one would cook during most of the weekdays and eat out during the weekends to get the most out of your stay!",

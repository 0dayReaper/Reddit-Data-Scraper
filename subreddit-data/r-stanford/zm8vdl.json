    "postText": "Hey, does anyone know of (not super hard) classes that can be taken completely remotely offered next quarter? Or is there a way to search explore courses for only remote classes without the dept filter? I need to take a certain number of units to keep my visa but am going to be working off campus all quarter and the only class I can find is CS 161. Any ideas appreciated!",

    "postText": "As seen in title I\u2019m deciding between Stanford and Wharton except I have no clue what I want to do. I initially applied to Wharton under the impression I would do finance but after informing myself a bit more I\u2019d prefer to not do so unless it involves a couple years of finance and a switch to something better after I\u2019m financially stable.\n\nThat said, I could do end up doing anything from law, public policy, to finance to engineering to public health, maybe pre-med?\n\nAdditionally, I\u2019m from the east coast and would know basically no one at Stanford. I have some friends at and around Penn and a great friend that also got into Penn this year.\n\nPenn:\nThe biggest 2 things going for Penn is the location (I\u2019d marginally prefer a city and more outreach opportunities is a big plus)\nAlso the great friend I have going to Penn would make adjustment easier.\nI\u2019m concerned about student body of wharton students \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. I\u2019m a male but i\u2019m not a \u201cdude\u201d. I actually enjoy learning and don\u2019t prioritize salary. I\u2019m at best a socialist, read theory and see humanity in women\ud83d\ude2d. I also lowkey want to take classes from David Eng. I also don\u2019t want to be funneled into IB but I can probably just make CAS friends. If I were to transfer to CAS I feel like then I should\u2019ve gone to stanford lol.\n\nStanford\nIt\u2019s literally Stanford. Way more freedom in doing things. Probably better student-life. Probably better student body for me as well. I\u2019m concerned about the Stanford bubble and the number of community outreach opportunities. Also if I don\u2019t do STEM will I be left out (might do stem but probably not big tech). The biggest issue is that it\u2019s very far and I\u2019d have to leave this friend of mine lol.\n\n(Both will be full-pay)\n\nAlso Brown and Duke are small considerations for me.\nPlz don\u2019t just say ignore your friend when choosing college. I know rationally I should but we are really close and I\u2019m irrational. Also they ED\u2019ed to Penn for me and they have the same issues with Penn that I do.",

            "comment": "If you\u2019re socialist-adjacent I imagine Wharton would be unbearable lol. Stanford is far from socialist too: the Econ department tends very neoclassical; polisci and IR are all generally neoliberal and have a lot of modernization theory believers. And of course we\u2019re startup central, which is inherently capitalist.\n\nThat said, I think Stanford is a nicer place to be if you don\u2019t know what you want to do. There are a lot of kids very set upon pursuing one prestigious path (eg medicine, law, tech, consulting etc), but that\u2019s common to any elite school. The STEM atmosphere is dominant but you won\u2019t have trouble finding a humanities/social science community. Even if most professors are far from socialist, many of them nevertheless have cool rigorous scholarship that is worth learning. It\u2019s good to engage with content you don\u2019t agree with. Also I think you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find any diehard socialist school anyways lol.\n\nThe bubble concerns are valid and should be a significant factor if you are a city person.",

            "comment": "The recruiting options for finance and other prestigious jobs, and grad school, are going to be equal between Stanford and Penn, so that is not a factor. There nothing wrong with taking your friends into account when picking a college.\n\nThe one exception is if you want to get a Silicon Valley job (even if you don't study CS), for which you should go to Stanford.\n\nAre you dead set on studying finance? Go to Wharton. (The closest thing to it at Stanford would be economics or MSE.) Also, Penn has some interesting and super-prestigious [named dual-degree programs](https://catalog.upenn.edu/undergraduate/interdisciplinary/coordinated-dual-degree/) that Stanford doesn't have direct counterparts for (although you can get a BAS or BA/BS).\n\nAre you unsure about what to study? Go to Stanford. Yes, you can transfer from Wharton to CAS or SEAS (and you're correct in doing so being easier than CAS to Wharton). But why go through the hassle in the first place?\n\nDo you want great weather year round? Go to Stanford.\n\nDo you want to live in a big city, don't mind winter weather, and want to be able to go to NYC or DC by train in a couple of hours? Go to Wharton.\n\nTo put the above two points another way: When you imagine college, do you want to bike around a tranquil, bucolic setting with lots of grass, or walk around a busy urban campus with lots of hustle and bustle? Do you want a \"state school\" experience complete with Power 5 football on Saturdays, or are you \"too cool\" for Division I athletics?",

Is this enough to warrant choosing Wharton over Stanford, meaning I lose the opportunity to potentially switch to CS or engineering on the off chance I change my mind? I know Wharton is better for finance, but is this worth locking myself out of exploring other paths?",

    "postText": "If I, over the course of my Stanford PhD program, manage to complete the coursework required for e.g. a CS-MS without being enrolled in the MS program, is it possible for that to formally be recognized as having completed a MS? Most of the courses I'm taking for the sake of my research are lining up to fulfill the requirements anyway. \n\nDoes anyone have experience trying something like this? Do I have to enroll in that MS program to get accredited?",

Definitely go ask staff affiliated with your college and department though; there are many programs that have built pathways for dual and joint degree programs. For example, the [School of Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/education/dual-degree-programs.html) lists the most popular joint degree pathways their students take.",

I can say that within CS, the MS admissions committee has discussions about whether someone is trying to \"sneak in\" to the program by getting accepted into a less competitive program, taking CS courses and then trying to get the CS degree. In other words, \"I completed all the requirements while in another department, give me the degree!\" doesn't go over well. But, I have seen it work at least once.",

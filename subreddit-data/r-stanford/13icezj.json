    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am an international student who has been admitted to Stanford and would like to know if it's allowed to work while in the U.S. but for a foreign company not based in the U.S. and which does not employ U.S. workers. I assume that the answer is a yes, but do the rules for CPT and maximum hours of work apply in this case? How does it work exactly?\n\nI've tried to research this online but got a few contradicting answers and it would be nice if people who have experience with this (or who know someone who has done something similar) can help me out!",

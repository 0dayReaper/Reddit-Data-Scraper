    "postText": "Hi all! I was just admitted at Stanford's undergrad class of 2027 and I'm super excited! I do have some questions and hope you can answer some of them.\n\n1. I was looking at the class of 2027 Instagram and everyone seems quite old? Maybe it's just an illusion but I was wondering how old people generally are when they enter university in the US (I'm an international student so I don't really have a clue).\n2. I didn't see any international students, which made me wonder, how do Stanford students view international students? Do international students usually clique together or are friend groups more mixed? From which countries are most international students?",

            "comment": "Most students entering as undergrads will be 18 years old. There are some exceptions, but the vast majority of your fellow university freshmen will be ~18. I'm guessing you're just overestimating the age of the people you saw on Instagram.\n\nIn my experience at Stanford, the view of international students is positive. Friend groups were definitely mixed; I was friends with many international students, and I really didn't see any cases of internationals being excluded by domestic students or anything like that. Most students are excited to get to meet/befriend someone from another country!",

There is an international student center (Bechtel) that provides a sense of community if you want it. But there are also many other settings for making friends: your dorm, your department, your activities. You get what you put in. Many years later, I'm still friends with several people from my department, a few people from my dorms, a few people from my activities and no one from Bechtel except for the international student advisor who is now retired.",

            "comment": "The only stereotype I encountered is that intl students are rich, but I don't find that affecting me. \n\nMy friends are like 50% intl 50% domestic. You can definitely pick if you want to be around other intl students more or domestic students more, but I think vast majority of intl students will spend at least some time with American students. My Chinese friend described her first year at NYU that she basically spoke Chinese only outside of classes which I think would be very unlikely to happen at Stanford lol.\n\nChina and India send the greatest number of intl students which makes sense because they also have the largest populations.",

    "postText": "Hi! Was just curious what you all focused on during your time at Stanford (could be anything!). College is a precious time, and though I have a good amount of friends, oftentimes I just stay in my room and study the night away (though I am getting much better at time management as a soph so planning to get out more next q). Wondering what you all think about the Stanford experience and how to get the most out of it + if there were any really great classes you\u2019ve taken. Any insight greatly appreciated :)",

            "comment": "I don't think anyone can give you a \"correct\" answer to this, but I've been out of Stanford for some time now and have had my mix of friends who generally regret how they spent their time at Stanford, as well as many friends who loved their time here. I can share some points of my own of what I observed for myself and others when wanting to get the best out of Stanford:\n\n* Explore activities when you have the time. There is so much free food and range of activities at Stanford that most people don't even know about, ask around for any good email listings and make it a point to head to some type of event at least once a week if you're a pretty strong introvert\n* On that note, going to new activities *does not mean* joining multiple orgs or commitments and taking on too much. Most of the happiest students at Stanford I noticed were the ones that had around 1-2 commitments or activities they stuck to and loved. That's not to say you can't be happy if you're in 4+ orgs or more, it's just such a time drain and you will feel as if your energy is drained and you will often spend a lot of time having to prioritize or schedule things out that you might feel unhappier about it overall\n* Go abroad junior year, that is one concrete thing I would have done if I was able to\n* Do some type of physical activity at least twice a week, whether that means a gym session 4x a week, swimming, or even just walking outside for ten minutes, make sure you know how to take a mental breather\n* Every person at Stanford, regardless of major, will have an awful quarter where it feels like your courseload hits you every single week (not even with a two week buffer), where your commitments (if you're involved) hit their strongest activity level, and where sleep and other free time are dramatically reduced. As much as this subreddit and other people talk about the positives and fun parts of Stanford, i've noticed the happiest students at Stanford are those that know how to manage these awful quarters. Just from observation these quarters are usually around sophomore Spring or junior Winter. For me personally, I felt alright during these quarters because I managed by trying to keep six hours of sleep a day (even if that meant taking naps), organizing study time with friends, and getting coffee or occasional food off-campus.\n* Understand that your group or friend dynamic will be adaptable and may change. I notice a lot of people have a harder time with friends after COVID, there's no right answer to finding your set of friends or right time (no, it's okay to not have any friends freshman year)\n\nI don't really have class recs. For classes, some classes I personally loved were EDUC 101, CS 124, STATS 203, ARTHIST 155C (an abstract expressionism class by Alex Nemerov which I liked as an art person). But I come from a CS/stats side so my answers are pretty different from others.",

And live the life that\u2019s best for you to achieve those goals. Then let other stuff take your time only to the degree it doesn\u2019t make all the stuff you need to do, harder. Because if you optimize the non academic, the academic stuff can hit a critical point where you are absolutely overwhelmed.",

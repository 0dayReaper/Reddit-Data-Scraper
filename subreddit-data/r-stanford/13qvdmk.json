In undergrad I met the person I did research with by taking their class and talking to them during office hours, but that isn't an option here. I'd like maybe some tips, a source I can look at for help, or perhaps even an example template I could follow. \n\nAll the best!",

If PhD, just send them an email.\n\n&gt; Hi Prof. XYZ, I'm a new PhD student at Stanford and find your research on ABC very interesting -- in particular, in one of your recent papers you mention DEF. Have you thought about how GHI might impact DEF, or whether JKL would work? If there's an opportunity to help out with this or related work, I'd love to meet and discuss it. Best, TUV\n\nOr, ask your advisor.\n\nIf you're a masters student, a similar email may work, but you may also have better luck emailing PhD students or postdocs in the professor's lab first.",

Would this change how I would communicate to the professor?",

So the question is: how do you get them to respond to your email? It can be very helpful to sound like you're not going to waste their time, that you can be helpful in some way for them or their projects/students, and that you have good analytical or idea-generating skills that would make yours a fruitful and/or enjoyable collaboration.\n\nIf they have a website with instructions on how to contact them (surprisingly common), follow those instructions. Talk to their students first so that you have useful background/context.\n\nAs always when communicating, it's helpful to keep in mind what *they* want and how *they* will be reading your email, not just what *you* want and how they can help you.",

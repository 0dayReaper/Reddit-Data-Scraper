    "postText": "I know this might be a long shot but I am feeling quite overwhelmed with my upcoming cross country move to Stanford from Durham, NC this Summer...\n\nIf anyone knows of rental properties that might be an option for us, based on the below wish list, PLEASE reach out to me/DM. \n\nMy husband and I are both practicing young physicians (completed med school in 2015 and 2016 respectively) and excellent tenets. We are hoping to grow our family by 1 in the next year, after going through IVF recently, fingers crossed.  The urgency in our search arises from the fact that I have been offered a position as a Clinician Educator Assistant Professor at Stanford, starting on September 1, 2023. Thus, finding a suitable home for our family before the academic year commences is of utmost importance to us.\n\nRental Housing goals/Wish List:\n\n\\- Monthly rent: $5000-$6000 per month\n\n\\- Move-in date: Early August 2023, looking for a 6-12 month lease\n\n\\- Pet Friendly: We have two professionally trained rescue doggos, Ziggy and Zion (lab mix and greyhound). And a declawed rescue cat, Bizz. We can provide a letter of rec from our dog trainer, a former K9 officer, upon request.\n\n\\- Fenced-in yard with a patch of grass for our dogs to enjoy.\n\n\\- Minimum 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms. \n\n\\- Garage for at least 1 car or a shed suitable for my husband's woodworking setup.\n\n\\- Central air conditioning.\n\n\\- Fireplace.\n\n\\- Ample storage space for our outdoor equipment like paddle boards, kayaks, bikes, and more.\n\n\\- Bonus points for an in-law suite or ADU type accommodation for our mothers when they come to visit. \n\n\\- Neighborhoods: we have been considering areas such as Palo Alto proper, Menlo Park, Redwood City, Los Altos, Cupertino, and Sunnyvale. Our preference is to stay on the Stanford side of the Bay, as I am unfamiliar with commute options from the East Bay. And for work, I need to be within 30 minutes of the hospital when on-call. \n\nWarm regards,\n\nKatie",

With high property values, owners rarely are willing to let homes sit empty to agree to a later start date. Often tenants don't give a notice of move out until the month before anyway.\n\nYour search criteria is relatively reasonable though. Pets limits things but it's doable",

This means that you will need to be able to move in immediately or close to it unless you're willing to eat the rent.\n\nOP, a good strategy might be to move and Airbnb or rent something short-term while you look for a long-term rental that fits your bill. Not ideal, but it's much easier to find something when you're already in the area.",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a prefrosh and I\u2019ve heard there is subtle racism from the surrounding area (from rich, predominantly White/Asian people) and not-so-subtle racism when it comes to campus security and policing in Palo Alto. I\u2019d love to hear the experiences of others (please only if you are Black). Also I know of Ujamaa. I\u2019m not asking about opportunities to connect w other Black students, I\u2019m asking specifically about instances of racism, micro aggressions, etc. and how frequently they happen.",

There is East PA which is slowly being gentrified and has experienced decades of racism with poor resource allocation where \u201cminorities\u201d live. \u201cThat\u2019s the other side of the tracks.\u201d \n\nEven a major National law firm ran into hot water for putting on it\u2019s address as being PA while located in East PA right along 101. \n\nOn the \u201cright side\u201d of the tracks lie: PA, Menlo Park, Los Altos, and Atherton (the billionaire hood). These are all very wealthy neighborhoods  with selective extreme wealth - the Zuckerbergs, Ellison\u2019s, etc. of the world live there. And cops are very aggressive. They don\u2019t have much to do other than constantly stop cars and give tickets. These Barney Fifes are always on the lookout. I got two ticky tacky tickets in LA and they were fairly hostile for a traffic ticket situation. You\u2019ll find these Fifes in every city in these types of neighborhoods. I have seen these same behaviors in Houston, Austin, and other places. I would not let this \u201cminutiae\u201d deter you from attending Stanford.",

This is literally the most liberal place on planet earth so if anything does happen here, it's guaranteed to be a lot worse anywhere else!\n\nThe police are usually extremely lenient even when they don't have to be.

One time the police offer swore to me he \"smelled marijuana and the car and had I been smoking\". It was bullshit and it was deeply frustrating. I didn't come to harm, but you do have to wary about external perception and resilient to such microaggression - if you call that micro.",

    "postText": "This is assuming I can get into the coterm. Because I am currently a dually enrolled student, I\u2019ll have 45 college credits that I can transfer to stanford, including my calculus series classes (maybe linear algebra and dif eq if that counts), language classes, and econ/accounting/psych classes.\n\nHowever, just asking in general, is it possible to do this dual degree combo and the coterm? I\u2019ve tried making a four year plan but am unsure whether I hit all the requirements for these degrees.  \n\nIf this is not possible, does anyone have any advice for what to do instead?",

No one has actually asked about my degree after I graduated, nor did any of my employers care. One of my eng degrees did help me with several summer internships, but I ended up not working in that engineering field anyways. \n\nNeither Econ of Math degree will \"open any doors\" by themselves, so you really should ask yourself why you want those degrees, and whether or not you actually want to take all the classes outlined in the major requirement for both of the degrees.",

I want to work in economic modelling or analysis but also want to keep my options open for other jobs especially in the analytical/quantative fields that deal more w math and programming, just bc econ modeling/analysis/forecasting in the public sector doesn\u2019t pay all too well.",

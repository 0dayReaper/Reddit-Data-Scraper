How is the research opportunities at Stanford as a MSCS student? Can you work with professors like Christopher Manning, Fei Fei Li, Chelsea Finn, Percy Liang, etc for your first semester at Stanford if you have relevant first author papers at top conferences? Or do professors avoid working with masters students or only accept those who have taken their classes(that is they don't accept those who have publications if the students haven't taken the class they teach)?\n\n2. Also, is MSCS good for networking with other MSCS, PhD, undergrads, postdocs, professors, VCs and those who work at the valley?",

Getting a *paid* RAship is the even more difficult. Getting a *paid* RAship with popular professors is most difficult. You'll essentially be competing with coterminal students who may have already started working with a professor during their undergrad, and the PhD students the professor already has. Stanford MSCS is an industry-focused MS program.",

You essentially have to get a variety of things to line up perfectly (eg secure a RAship as a MSCS student, be able to meet with the prof often enough to make an impression, make a positive impression, get into PhD program, and get your chosen advisor to advise you).",

Advisor bandwidth is only so finite, and the time a potential advisor has for their students can vary significantly from year to year depending on teaching, research, consulting, travel, and other obligations. Budgets can also shift drastically from year to year. A PI's research focus can also change, meaning that a student who would be a good fit one year would be a bad fit the next, due to lack of $ or because the PI just wants to shift away from that area for some reason. All of that is out of your control.\n\nAnd, sometimes it simply boils down to the MS student not being able to make a positive impression during their RAship, or the RAship showing that having them as a PhD student just wouldn't be a good fit in some way.",

The fact that you have demonstrated research experience will help a lot. Just put yourself out there and cast a wide net, you'll find someone willing to work with you. Also look outside the CS dept, there are lots of folks doing CS-adjacent work in other departments like MS&amp;E, the med school, and the GSB.",

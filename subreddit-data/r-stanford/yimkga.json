    "postText": "Hi! I'm a current Symsys senior looking for full-time roles and feeling a little discouraged and in the dark. I've been actively searching for roles but have yet to find anything (have received many rejections SMH). As far as types of roles, I'm pretty open \u2013 interested in consulting, PMing, SWE, etc., so perhaps the competitive nature of those roles is a factor. I haven't had any \"big-name\" internships, either. I can't help but wonder if I am/have been doing something entirely wrong this whole time without realizing it. Is it normal to not have found a job yet this early? When do seniors usually finalize their plans for the next year? \n\nAlso, I've had some friends say that the job market this year is particularly bad. Should I be assuming the difficulty in finding roles is mostly due to this? Does anyone know this to be true? \n\nFinally, does anyone know of any resources/lists for finding jobs, especially for companies recruiting out of Stanford (specifically for ones starting next Fall, not now)? Or, how to get referrals to companies? I'm on a few email lists and have been attending career fairs/info sessions but have struggled to find any central resources, I feel like I keep missing out on things solely due to not hearing about them.\n\nMost of my friends from home aren't planning on starting the job search until after graduation, but I feel like things are so different here. I just feel very in the dark about applying to full-time, any advice is appreciated!",

I was in a similar position earlier this year when I was applying for internships and I was getting nowhere. Until I started applying to less companies but tailoring it to each one. I\u2019ve been applying for full time positions now and it\u2019s a bit better, even though I haven\u2019t had any big name internships. Feel free to reach out and I can try and help/give tips on job searching.\n\nEdit: I think for tech, the market right now is a bit harder than the past few years but you might still be able to find a job at smaller companies. Be mindful of deadlines as some of the companies including consulting have already closed their applications.",

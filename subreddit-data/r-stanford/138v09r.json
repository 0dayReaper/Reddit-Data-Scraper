    "postText": "Just here to vent (I assume there's nothing that can be done now about it) but\n\nI put in a $20 bill into the snacks machine- I had no other cash. I thought I would get several items. After the first ($1.65), it paid me $7 or $8 in change, leaving me with $10.35 in credit. I didn't think to remove my item before buying more. After some delay (30 seconds?) I tried to punch in  new item numbers to finish using that credit (the change button wasn't working) but the purchases wouldn't process. The credit started incrementally decreasing each second and I only realized after it was all gone that I had to remove the snack I bought first. So I just lost more than $10 to that vending machine.\n\nThere's a phone number labelled on the machine but I didn't think to call it since I didn't know if it would do anything. Has anyone had a similar experience or dealt with the company before? Do you know if they do any sort of refunds? Is this just how the machine is supposed to operate?",

            "comment": "With vending machines in general, you can call the number on the machine or talk to a local office administrator and explain what happened. Not too many people put $20 bills in vending machines, so if you speak up right away, they could verify the error + the machine should be over on money when they reconcile.",

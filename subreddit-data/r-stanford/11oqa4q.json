Since Stanford doesn\u2019t give you any credits even if you get 5 on exams, wondering if we can just skip one or two exams and just focus on studying the other two. I don\u2019t know how Admissions office looks at that. Thank you for any insight.",

This depends on the subject; for AP Stats there's no credit given for a 5, but for plenty of others a score of 5 most certainly earns credit here (unlike some other institutions):\n\n[https://studentservices.stanford.edu/my-academics/earn-my-degree/test-transfer-credit/external-test-credit/advanced-placement-ap-credit](https://studentservices.stanford.edu/my-academics/earn-my-degree/test-transfer-credit/external-test-credit/advanced-placement-ap-credit)",

They told us last time they only want us to take AP courses and do well to show academic proficiency since AP tests just like standardized testing are more uniform across the country vs high school GPAs since many schools have different grading criteria (+/-, harsher/more lenient due to quality/reputation of the school, and grades are manipulated and curved vs none). Now looks like some AP courses qualify for credit",

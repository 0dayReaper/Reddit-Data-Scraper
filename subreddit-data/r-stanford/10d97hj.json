I still see other students work their and I would also love to get involved. Can anyone point me somewhere that I can start? I have emailed the center ([inequality@stanford.edu](mailto:inequality@stanford.edu)) but I haven't gotten a response for a very long time.",

I swear they still are all there even though they haven't published any media, held events, or touched their website since 2019. Presumably someone important died of covid early on? Beats me. I'd like to know what you find out.",

    "postText": "Was wondering the experience of typical coterms who stay past their guaranteed housing quarters on Stanford's campus in regards to finding housing. Since it is not guaranteed, what is the worst case scenario here, and how commonly does that occur? Do coterms typically end up finding housing even though it's not guaranteed?",

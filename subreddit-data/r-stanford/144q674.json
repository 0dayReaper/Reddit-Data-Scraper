The only case it might help would be for jobs that explicitly don't accept B.S. degrees (some staff researcher roles maybe?), but those are much fewer in number.\n\nAlso, Google APM takes like 4 kids from Stanford a year, so unless you think you're one of the 4 smartest kids in your class, I wouldn't plan around getting into that program.",

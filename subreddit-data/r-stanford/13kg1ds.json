I would like to understand if Math 51 is more aligned with an undergraduate-level course or if it is considered more advanced in nature and if these topics are used in Quant Finance.",

It\u2019s not an advanced class but there are tons of applications of the material. It\u2019s not too uncommon for graduate students to take it because many need a refresher or haven\u2019t seen the material before (e.g., many CS programs don\u2019t require multivariate calculus.) Graduate linear algebra is covered in courses like EE263",

If you do, I'd definitely recommend that class, as it's quite a good class. \n\nOtherwise all of the other classes seem like great preparation, I'd definitely prioritize getting a mastery over linear algebra and calculus though. \n\nAlso, are you early on in your bachelors?

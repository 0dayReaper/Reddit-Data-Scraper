I would just apply and see what happens.\n\nOtherwise, best bet is probably to be a Research Assistant, try emailing professors and postdocs.",

I've seen an exception made for a niche graduate course, but a lot of stars had to align and it didn't happen until after the usual hiring cycle. RAships without any prior relationship with a professor (eg at least 1 quarter of free labor) seem similarly unlikely.\n\nThere are a nontrivial number of MSCS admits every year, however, who had a CAship guaranteed in their offer letter and end up CAing their first quarter.",

I know at least 5 people without guaranteed funding (myself included) who got CAship first quarter\u2026 I\u2019ve literally never heard of this policy outside reddit.\n\nEdit to add: this was for a variety of courses, from core courses like cs161 to graduate ones like you mentioned. Most of my other friends also found RA first quarter without prior relationship with any of the professors, although they had previous research experience in their undergrad. I feel like if you\u2019re qualified on paper and you\u2019re proactive about reaching out, then there\u2019s a decent chance of getting _something_ first quarter.",

Probably a bit of both?",

Though it seems to have been a very marginal scenario, was brought on after the quarter had already started due to over-enrollment I believe.",

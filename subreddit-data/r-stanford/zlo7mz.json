I'm not that stashed to be honest but maybe I can manage. I'll be on a J1 visa so I can't work I guess. \n\nSo can you people suggest any cost cutting measures that I could use or any advice regarding keeping my spending down while I'm there, atleast for the first 6 months.",

They always have tons of stuff so don\u2019t worry about the time you go. Chicken, rice, beans, fruit, oil, tofu, vegetables, potatoes etc. It\u2019s been a great way for me to save money for the past year. \n\nTransport: If you\u2019re living on campus, walk or use the free campus shuttle to get around. If you\u2019re off campus, check on the transportation website to see if you qualify for the free Go pass (not sure if they\u2019re still running it this quarter). \n\nYou can also reach out to the financial aid office to see if you can get a cash advance on your salary. Good luck with everything!",

Id say 30 minimum, especially considering they have to settle in a new country, or am I being crazy here?\n\nBut regarding legality I think you are right! This cannot be legal. To be appointed by Stanford you need a faculty sponsor who basically signs not only to pay for you but also cover benefits. Actually, you will need proof of health insurance (both for the J1 status but more so for Stanford). The only way to wave that is to get an equally covered private insurance on your own (which is pretty much impossible as a foreigner, as they require uncapped coverage, which no insurance will provide for the US).\n\n@OP please stop and re-evaluate! What you are about to do sounds not only morally questionable but is probably illegal and could even get you into serious trouble with homeland security (which is the last thing you want)...",

You could still come to campus once a week.\n\nBut honestly as a post doc you are already making enough sacrifices even if you are getting paid (multiply that x3 and you have a rough estimate of your industry worth). It is likely not worth it to do free labor for them. Also what about healthcare? If they dont pay you, you probably also dont get benefits. Make sure everything is thought out before jumping ahead of yourself. Maybe come here for a few weeks to see whether you really like it that much to be worth all those sacrifices. One of the best perks are the resources but that only applies for well-funded labs\u2026\n\nNot to discourage you, but please just think this through. No money is usually a red flag and can hint towards an unstable exploitative lab, be careful, you are highly educated and likely very successful researcher, dont let yourself get exploited!!!",

I know people at MGH, Mayo, and CCF also doing the same. Doesn't justify it but also the only way for foreign medical grads to get into surgical specialities.",

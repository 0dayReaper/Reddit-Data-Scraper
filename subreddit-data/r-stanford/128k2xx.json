Apart from all these high fevers, asthma attacks, five rounds of antibiotics and lots of cortisone pills, my daughter's also been having a sadly severe facial acne issue, so I'm hoping she will have easy access to doctors (not sure if dermatologists are covered by the student health insurance though, despite its high cost).\n\nWe're concerned as we live on the other side of the world and we're not really well-off (she's been offered a scholarship), so as much as I would love to see my daughter there too, these are all issues we need to consider. So, I'd really appreciate it if  you guys could tell me more about these things, and also if you can share what your e.g. housing experience was like in the first year (I've no idea what life as a Stanford undergrad is like). \n\nThank you, wish you all the best!",

In my experience, as long as you can resist the temptation to take 20 units every quarter and have good time management, it's not really hard to get 8hr sleep every day and do well academically and socially.\n\nFor health care, I'm quite happy with the care I received here. I did a lot of research before visiting the hospital for the first time here out of the fear of terror stories I heard about US health care system, but it turned out I just had to call vaden to get a referral and the rest was painless. You should check cardinal care statement of benefits to make sure the cares your daughter need are covered though.",

            "comment": " I have never had to use the healthcare plan so far (as an international soph I have yet to overcome the perhaps unfair view drilled into me of the US healthcare system as a threatingly expensive scam). That being said, Cardinal Care is fairly good, from what I have heard from my peers. It covers most things like dental and GP visits.\n\nTo allay your fears about CS - Stanford makes it incredibly easy to not fail classes, and to get a good GPA. I know of people who did not hand in final projects for certain classes and who ended up getting a B, for instance. Median grade is A-/B+ for most STEM classes - contrast this with Berkeley where the curve is at least a full letter grade lower in some cases. It is an open secret that our GPAs are also inflated by the fact that A+ grades give 4.3/4.0, which is a luxury not many other students around the country seem to have. \n\nWhile the school has certain issues when it comes to administrating student life (eg. the incident with the Tree, and mental health support in general), it does bend over backwards to make sure students graduate with respectable GPAs, good job prospects, and the right connections. Opportunities abound, and will find you even if you aren't actively looking for them. \n\nKeep in mind that although your daughter may have put CS as her intended major here, no one will bat an eye if she doesn't end up choosing CS as her major - the school certainly won't interrogate her if she does something else. After you're in, you're free to do what you please. If she finds CS to not be her cup of tea, there are endless other choices for her. I'm sure she will be just fine.\n\nEdit: Spelling\n\nEdit2: Typo",

I would think if she has Cardinal Care, she will be taken care of with relatively little drama, at least when she's at Stanford.\n\nAs far as CS, the program is tough, but people quickly build support networks and that makes it all manageable. I think that as long as your daughter makes some friends in CS, she will be just fine. And there's plenty of opportunities to do so (sections, office hours, clubs, etc).",

I wonder, though, if that's Stanford's fault, or perhaps it's been long embedded in these students from the high school grind...\n\nI'm also an older adult and current student. I feel horrible for what these kids go through, but they seem to not complain... but are they truly happy or conditioned since high school to accept a toxic work environment with no balance... I haven't figured it out. \n\nIt's a hard thing... it's Stanford. I'm not CS so she might love it. It'll be a challenge, sure. Does Stanford care how courseload and stress affects student health?\nIs our disability accommodations system acceptable?\n\nAbso-fucking-lutely not. If she can come do CS and not worry about her grades (looks like another post recently, poor kid stressing about B's and C's in some of the foundational CS classes..), why not. I think the community for CS seems strong, lots of organizations to get involved with based on what you want, women in CS, CS for social good, etc. That part seems cool. But that's outside of class..\n\nKnowing how mental and emotional stress hurts physical health... that is scary. Can she come and not compare herself to others and deal with bad grades and just decide to ride the wave and enjoy the experience? Sure, we all come here just for the Stanford name. \n\nWho knows why the hell else.",

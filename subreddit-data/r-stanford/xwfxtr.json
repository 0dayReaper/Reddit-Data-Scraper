I am a visiting scholar at the Department of English, and I'd like to connect with new people, especially movie buffs like me to grab a coffee or go to the movies together.\n\nI am doing a PhD in Germany, and I'll stay on campus for 9 months. I am gonna try to use Reddit to create new connections. Write me!",

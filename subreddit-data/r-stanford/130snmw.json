    "postText": "I'm most likely going to purchase a meal plan for the fall quarter. I've been living on my own for a few years now so I can cook and I even enjoy it. But I'm living in a shared apartment next year and as a germaphobe, I struggle sharing kitchen spaces. I acknowledge its all psychological but to save myself the anxiety, I'm going to eat in a dining hall. In my opinion, it's a good deal considering the cost of food/groceries in Palo Alto and the time saved. \n\nI'm self-conscious about being the only grad student in the dining halls (which I assume will be mostly undergrads). Should I be worried about this? I havent come across another stanford grad student on meal plan.",

There are older folks (I assume staff/faculty) eating by themselves, as well as young faculty who bring their whole family, kids and spouse and all, to the dining halls. You won't stand out, at all.",

The flexibility of cooking for yourself whenever is nice but the cost per swipe for each meal works out to be less than my weekly groceries. I went to the dining hall for the first time with a few friends two weeks ago and the food was really good quality with a variety of healthy options. 15/10 recommend\u2026I\u2019ll definitely consider it if I\u2019m living on campus next year.",

If you expect to consistently go for breakfast, lunch, and dinner the full meal plan might make sense, but there is so much free food available on campus from all kinds of events that having some flexibility can be nice. \n\nAlso many people bring Tupperware so they can bring food/snacks home and stretch the value of each swipe. You can always buy more swipes, but getting stuck with too many is annoying because they expire at the end of the academic year.",

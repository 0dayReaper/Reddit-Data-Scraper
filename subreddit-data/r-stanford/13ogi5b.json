    "postText": "I\u2019m a rising frosh getting no aid from Stanford. My parents have repeatedly said that they are very proud of me for getting into Stanford and are willing to pay tuition for all 4 years. I\u2019m feeling EXTREMELY guilty about this. My parents can afford to pay the tuition but it would set them back years on their life goals. Additionally, I feel like my parents are losing their money after having it for the first time in their lives (parents\u2019 small business took off somewhat recently during COVID).\n\nSo how can I make the 328k back as soon as I can?\n\nI applied as a math major, but am thinking about switching to CS to work in big tech after graduating. However, I have never coded a day in my life and have no idea where to start. If money was not in the picture, I would most likely continue pursuing math and maybe minor in philosophy. Money *is* in the picture, but would it even be worth switching to CS (especially considering all the tech layoffs)? Is this switch even realistic or is this a dumb and naive idea?\n\nRight now, I work at my friend\u2019s family restaurant and am making minimum wage. Is there any way I can use \u201cthe Stanford name\u201d to get a higher paying job? What else could I do this summer and beyond to make a dent in that number?\n\nI would really really appreciate any guidance at all.",

            "comment": "The last thing your parents want is for you to spend your time at Stanford feeling guilty about tuition, or worse still wasting that time and that opportunity pursuing something you\u2019re not particularly interested in, out of some notion that you have to pay them back tuition money. (For the vast majority of Stamford graduates, the tuition will be a drop in the bucket of lifetime earnings no matter what you study.) Also: I suspect their other \u201clife goals\u201d are not as important to them as having happy, successful children, so I\u2019m not sure why you differentiate your attending Stanford from their \u201clife goals\u201d.\n\nGo, become an even more interesting person, study whatever motivates you, and pay it *forward*: if you have kids, be your full self and support them the way your parents are supporting you now. If you don\u2019t, find other ways to give back to your community. That\u2019s what you owe your parents and everyone who supported you on coming this far.",

But Math + coding or + finance or whatever (with an internship to show for it) and you\u2019ll be as able to get those jobs as anyone else.

Replace the EE minor with philosophy and you can still do everything. Like you, math is my main passion, but I've come to realize that the usefulness of CS and wanted to take advantage of Stanford. I think the coterm is a great way to do it because the CS BS is almost 100 units. But the CS coterm is only 45 units. Also, this doesn't really get in the way of your math and philosophy ambitions since you probably will be taking 1-2 math classes a quarter. Leaving you space to take 1-2 CS classes, and 1-2 other classes depending on how things stack up. This is quite a bit of work, but it does allow you to accomplish everything. And with good planning and time management, I still find myself having typically friday night and all of Saturday to have fun with my friends and have a good social life. \n\nI also want to point out that math is perfectly fine for making money in the future. In fact, skilled mathematicians I would argue are rarer than good coders.",

You need to be able to do programming, simulation, algorithms, etc.  Are you doing, for instance, financial math or applied math/scientific computing? A math major with no coding skills is a tough spot to be because modern math is mostly about computing.\n\nAs long as you do the applied math track, work on your programming (check out code academy or data camp), make a portfolio, you can be good for the job market.\n\nIn my opinion, Philosophy minor is a waste of time unless you do a double minor with something else that's useful. I'm all for studying and learning, but you are also investing given how expensive education in the US is. If you were in Europe, where education is free, by all means, do philosophy. But is a philosophy minor really worth 100,000?\n\nI'd switch the minor to stats or computer science.\n\n&gt;What else could I do this summer and beyond to make a dent in that number?\n\nRA for a professor,  prepare portfolio to apply for internships which open in the fall 2023 for summer 2024. Summer internships can pay well and top internships can pay a ton of money just for the summer. You also need to network and join clubs on campus. Most jobs are through referrals and if you don't know anyone, then it's going to be hard to get a job or an internship (yes, even competitive internships can take referrals). If your connections are only math majors who do theoretical work and want to stay in academia, that's not a good enough network.",

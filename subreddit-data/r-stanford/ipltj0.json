    "postText": "I saw on the Carta beta website that \"Carta is **AT RISK** of being shut down in November 2020 as a result of losing access to data from the University. The data shown on Carta may become inaccessible to students. ExploreCourses and other course planning services may also be shut down.\" The people who run the website have offered a link to a petition that we can all sign to hopefully prevent this from happening: [link](https://forms.gle/dBxEDU78GDrqHmAv6).\n\nEven though I am only an incoming freshman, Carta has been essential in my course planning and provided me tremendous help. I can't imagine how helpful Carta will be for me in the coming years, and I hope we can keep it alive.\n\nsidenote: Does anyone know if the grade distributions will ever come back?",

From deciding not to return grade distributions after the CR/NC quarter this past Spring, to demoting Carta from a research project to a student project, meaning they will very likely lose access to all student data displayed on the site. The administration never consulted Carta or any other students about these changes.\n\nI think the administration just *doesn't believe* that the benefits of the student data displayed on Carta outweighs the cons. I don't personally know what the cons are, as Stanford has not communicated any reasons as to why they are restricting the data, but the closest thing I could think of is the study from 2018 related to grade distributions leading to worse grades (mentioned in comments).\n\nThe main purpose of the petition is to communicate that the student body believes that the student data shown on Carta (grade distributions, weekly workload in hours, teacher ratings, student reviews, etc. ) is ultimately useful to students in making educated decisions when planning courses.\n\nI personally find it irresponsible for the administration to make these changes without informing and/or consulting students, especially since this is all happening during the confusion with COVID -- it feels underhanded.",

So they want to hide information from the students to appease those professors?\n\nPerhaps another reason is they feel Carta is influencing students' choice of majors (due to course reviews, grades, number of people who took it in the past), which might be hurting departments that are bleeding students?\n\nI really can't think of any good reasons they would want to do this to be honest.",

I was taking a pretty hard load on major reqs, but I also combed through Carta to find a light course I was interested in (Complit 127B). I saw the Carta reviews and workload distribution so I knew I could manage it in my schedule. If I was going in blind, no way I would risk it with the rest of my schedule being pretty rough. Instead I would probably end up taking something like Germany in 5 Words, a famously easy WAYS class that I wasn't nearly as interested in.",

The student learning experience is paramount and improving upon it should be the goal of a feedback-based system. Reviews are the most direct way to measure this.\n\n&gt; It allows both students to instead go \u201cthe assignment on X was really long and tedious\u201d\n\nBut this is a very fair criticism. Some courses have specific assignments which are truly unreasonable or are not given an appropriate time frame to complete. This is valid, specific, and helpful feedback.\n\n&gt;  profs to make their courses easier (which =/= better)\n\nArguable. You can teach the same content at the same level but a lot of times the \"difficulty\" comes from poor class organization, bad textbook/readings, poor or hard-to-understand teaching, assignments/tests that are misaligned with what was taught or those that are unreasonably long, etc. Carta allows students to point this out.\n\n&gt;  why do we need so much information on grade distribution\n\nTo make informed decisions on what classes to take. How they might affect our GPA, how many hours we might have to devote, if a professor is a fair grader are important factors in deciding.\n\n&gt;  Does the information presented above make Class X &gt; Class Y? Of course not.\n\nWhy not? For example, it greatly reduces stress - it means you can enjoy the material without worrying about the grade.\n\n&gt; they care so much, too much , about their grades\n\nThis is very subjective. In my opinion, students only care about grades to the extent that 3rd parties (grad schools, employers, parents) care about grades. If you're premed, you definitely have to make informed decisions to keep your GPA very high if you want to go to med school, for example.\n\n&gt; If getting rid of Carta incentivizes more students to take a more challenging and more rewarding Class Y\n\nI don't think it's \"providing incentive.\" Rather it relies on obscuring knowledge so that students make less informed decisions. A course's content/substance is not necessarily more rewarding or challenging just because the grade distribution is lower.",

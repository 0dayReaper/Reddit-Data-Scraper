    "postText": "\nHi there, I am a social worker from austria. I am planning to go abroad next year (approx. March 24 - July/August 24). Since I finished my masters programme in educational sciences and currently taking part in the training as a psychotherapist, I am looking for an internship, traineeship or likewise in or around Stanford. I am interested in the clinical field, psychiatry and mental health. I dont know where to start to plan this journey. \n\nDoes anyone of you have some experience to share, some tips where to find vacancy/ job postings? \n\nThank you so much!",

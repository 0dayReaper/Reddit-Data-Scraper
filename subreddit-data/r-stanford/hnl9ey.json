It was so easy and common, he said, that his private admission counseling firm also had a fencing training firm right in the same building as well (I can't quite remember which firm it was in particular but it's one of South Korea's largest ones -- maybe someone actually from SK can chime in). He said anytime he got a 9th grade student without a major selling point, he would just train the kid in fencing and get them in almost 100% of the time. I would imagine Stanford and peer institutions had something similar going on as well.\n\nWhile it's definitely true that not all sports are backdoors, and that the majority of atheletes are extremely hard-working, I don't think we can pretend that bad fruits gaming the system don't exist.",

As such, assuming roughly 5-10% annual interest once invested, this leaves about  $10-20 million annual operating budget for those sports. This is the same way all endowments work, just narrowed down to these specific sports.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the sports that were cut, they seem to be large money-losers for the university. Synchronized swimming or sailing needs that aforementioned endowment to sustain itself probably because they don't have donations or merch/ticket sales funding like football, basketball, etc. As such, football doesn't need an endowment because it probably gets more donations and ticket sales. Other sports may be \"in general self-sustaining\" because they might roughly make up for their expenditure in some modest ticket sales or donations. They might not be profitable like football, but I wouldn't think it unreasonable for most of the remaining sports to generally be only moderate losses at worst.\n\nThese numbers all together make sense because if those 11 sports take up about $10-20 million roughly, then it's concievable that the total athletic expenditure for ALL sports is $90-100 million per year. The $200 million is the expected endowment to sustain the 11 cancelled sports, which the university has chosen to get rid of because they are expensive. This does not mean the university gets $200 million back in its operating budget (if they did that would be a huge boost because all these austerity measures are coming from an estimated $260 million loss on the year), it is just one part of many unfortunate measures taken by the university to try and claw it's way back out of losses.",

Without further itemization of budgets, I would guess this is one of two things:\n\n* $200M is the cost to maintain these sports over the next few years of budgeting. Without cuts, Stanford is facing a budget shortfall of hundreds of millions of dollars over the next year alone (and no matter how tempting it may be, you can't just \"draw from the endowment\", since most of those funds are restricted for very specific purposes). These sports also face headwinds with the current COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. if \"moneymaker\" sports like football have restricted attendance at best next year, then athletics can't even cover its own costs next year without drastic measures), and alumni may be more hesitant to donate in a recession, which exacerbates budget shortfalls.\n\n\n* $200M is the cost to permanently endow enough of these sports' costs that the calculus works out in their favor. As a rule of thumb, if you want an endowed fund to pay out $X a year, you need to permanently endow it with 20X-25X that amount (so its annual returns cover a specific cost for all eternity). This works out to $8M to $10M/year that the $200M permanent endowment would supply, which seems a little low for all 11 sports, but is still plausible if it covers significant costs (facility use and staff salaries).\n\nEdit: u/Archym3d3s also has a good response covering permanent endowment!",

                    "comment": "I\u2019m confused by that too. Your quote says permanently. But what would that mean? A 200 million dollar annuity would pay out enough each year to fund the programs in perpetuity? That\u2019d certainly be an interesting way to look at it. A different quote independently discusses 3 years. \n\n&gt; The school projected a shortfall of nearly $70 million over the next three years due to the pandemic and estimated it would cost more than $200 million to sustain the 11 sports that will be cut.\n\nBut that would be 6 million per year per program. Which seems way too high to me. \n\nBroadly, basketball and football make all the money. A few might break even and the rest lose money. By cutting the programs that lose money the university can monetize sports. I\u2019m vaguely surprised rich donors didn\u2019t step in for some of these, but given the admissions scandals maybe the university didn\u2019t want to push that too hard.\n\nEdit: u/Archym3d3s ninja\u2019d me more eloquently.",

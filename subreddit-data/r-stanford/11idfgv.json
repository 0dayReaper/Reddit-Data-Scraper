I would like to take an additional CS class to knock out a requirement for my track and I was wondering if anyone can recommend on whether to take CS155 vs CS144?\n\nWould appreciate any tips to prepare for CS161 as well.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "CS144 is substantially more work than 155 imo, but if the rest of your course load is easy I don't think you'd be too overwhelmed if you took 161 and 144 together. Both are great classes and you should take them both at some point before you graduate. They're very different though. In 144 you'll learn how the internet works and spend the quarter writing code for a network interface. 155 gives you a broad overview of security, split into three parts: buffer overflows, web security, and network security. You'll learn how to write exploits. Do whichever sounds more appealing, but if you have doubts about time management then go with 155 and save 144 for another quarter.",

Unlike 107/111 you'll work on a quarter-long project that builds on itself--which is more like  \"real world\" programming",

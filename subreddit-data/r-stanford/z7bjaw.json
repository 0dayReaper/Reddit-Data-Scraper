    "postText": "Hi everyone!! I'm currently considering between CS107E and CS107. If I were to go with CS107E, will there be a knowledge gap in certain concepts for future CS classes? I'm worried that if there's a bigger emphasis on EE, I might miss out on certain principles that are covered in CS107. Thanks, and I'd appreciate any insight! Also, would the following schedule be doable:\n\n\\- CS107(E), CS109, IntroSem, ForeignLang (pretty easy for me)",

Definitely my favorite class at Stanford, I'd be glad to chat about any other questions you might have about it.",

            "comment": "CS107E is a big time commitment. Go in on a weekend morning to work on an assignment, its midnight before you know it and there's still a ways to go. Very sad.\n\nThat said, totally recommend. It's super awesome! You learn so much, and the assignments and projects you get to do are pretty darn impressive. Realizing that you've built your own printf/console+keyboard/monitor logic from scratch is kind of insane.\n\nAlso it's taught by a Turing award winner who likes to pay for snacks in the winter. Small CS class dynamic is a good experience too.\n\nWon't fall behind on CS classes at all. You learn more than 107. There's like a 1/4 lecture on security you miss, I think. Details: [http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107e/](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107e/)  Bigger EE emphasis is actually very valuable, especially given the modern craze for chips. You'll get a broader perspective. \n\nWorkload looks v doable :) Some introsems can drain time though, so I'd check carta and be wary of that.",

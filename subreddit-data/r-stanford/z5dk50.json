    "postText": "Deciding between taking either of the 2 CS classes. I am taking another intensive CS course so wanted to keep my workload minimal if possible, I've heard 224W is somewhat chill but also involves a lot of theoretical math/proofwriting which I am horrible at. Is 224N more practical and application based?",

            "comment": "CS 224W doesn't involve proof-writing and isn't very math intensive. It is essentially a survey of various GNN models/techniques, many of which are very recent. I would say CS 224N is more practical/application based, as you cover really useful things like large language models.  224N isn't math intensive either, and you end up writing a lot of pytorch code, which is nice. Plus the project lets you explore something you're interested in.",

You would definitely have a bit more work to do without the pre-reqs, but I still think it would still be less than 224N. 224W has an exam and a project (which is pretty straightforward), where has 224N only has a really big project. 224N could be easier depending on your project choice.",

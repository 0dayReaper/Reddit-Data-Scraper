I considered transferring because I thought there had to be more to college life than just the classroom and the library.  Pure academics was BORING. Where was the social life?  So I decided to join a fraternity and was able to find a great group of people who wanted to experience some fun in their academic life and it WAS fun.  We made our own fun and the students outside the Greek system who joined us for our social events had fun too. Football was a big part of that fun. Stanford has been at war with the  Greek system (and fun) for as long as I can remember.  I would always be hesitant to recommend Stanford to a college bound student who was looking for a balance of academics and social life for their college experience.  It seems the university has doubled down on making the campus a dull place to attend.",

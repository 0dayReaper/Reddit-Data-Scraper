    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm a incoming frosh accepted REA. Still super undecided, but rn I'm rlly interested in Symbolic Systems, especially its concentrations in Human-Computer Interaction and Natural Language.\n\nI was wondering if anybody could share some insights/advice about Symbolic Systems as well as the concentrations I mentioned. I couldn't find much info online or any student testimonials aside from a few reddit threads, so anything would help. Also happy to chat via DMs as well. Thanks!",

The first ~4 qtrs with of requirements is a great survey of all the interconnected topics between CS, Phil, Cog Sci, Linguistics, Education, Logic. The last 2 years is a bunch of depth around the theory and practice of interface design. I graduated into a PM role at a startup and later transitioned to being a VC. The breadth is particularly useful in VC. If you want to be a developer, I'd recommend CS major instead (and take HCI curriculum for interest). Many SymSys go on to be developers, and SymSys requires the same coursework as the CS Minor, but I think extra depth in things like advanced algos or compilers would really benefit a career dev.",

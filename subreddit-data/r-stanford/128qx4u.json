    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all. With spring around the corner, I want to really commit to a major. But I\u2019m still just so unsure. \n\nMy freshmen year I took a lot of sociology and political science, but lost interest heading into Sophomore year. I also took Math 51, CS106A. \n\nFall quarter this year I didn\u2019t really do anything. Winter I took Math 52, Math 56 and some ways classes. Next quarter I plan to take PWR2, Spanlang 3, and Math 53. \n\nI\u2019ve been leaning towards math, but feel that I don\u2019t have the passion I need to really succeed and try hard. I didn\u2019t take the 61 series, and I got a B- in Math 52. I also don\u2019t want to be trapped in just one department the rest of my time here. \n\nI liked 106A, and still want to take 106B. But Im not sure what for, as I don\u2019t think I can complete a CS major in basically 2 years. \n\nI\u2019ve been looking at the Design/ME major, but again, I\u2019m not sure I can finish that in time. I only have 3 ways left to do, and I don\u2019t plan on going abroad. So I have 6 more quarters after this Spring to lock down and try my best. I just don\u2019t know at what. \n\nAny advice? What\u2019s still possible?",

It looked like I was the closest to completing a CS major &amp; the major had the fewest number of classes I'd have to go out of my way to take so I'm now a CS major.",

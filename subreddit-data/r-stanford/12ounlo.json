    "postText": "Hi, international student here working while studying in my last year of undergrad. I work a full time job to pay for school/rent, but want to graduate as soon as possible to get my degree. Have completed my major requirements but need more units to get to 180. Are there any online classes (ideally asynchronous) offered this quarter that I could take to help me get there? I know about PATH 51, but any other suggestions appreciated. Thank you!",

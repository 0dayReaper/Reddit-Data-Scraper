    "postText": "I know that \"easy commute\" might be an oxymoron when we're talking about traveling between Stanford and Davis, but I've been accepted to a grad program at Stanford and my spouse will be starting a program at UC Davis. We haven't thrown out the idea of having separate places and seeing each other on weekends, but would really prefer not to do this even if the commute is painful.\n\nWe will have at least one car (though we could get another) but we are hoping to use trains to be able to work during the commute. My spouse will need to be at Davis 3-4 times a week and I will need to be in Stanford 4-5 times a week \u2014 we've figured out that we could live somewhere near the San Francisco Station, which would be a 1-1.5 hour drive to Davis and a 45 minute train to Stanford.\n\nIs this the best option? Does anyone have any other ideas? Is this crazy?",

            "comment": "SF to Davis is reverse commute, not that bad. It's gonna be $14/day in tolls though. Living near the Caltrain terminus in SF is probably your best bet. I know grad students who commute from SF to campus, it's not any crazy idea (but they only have to come 2-3 times per week though). When you factor in getting from the Caltrain to your final destination on campus, the commute would be closer to 1h15min. You can either take the Marguerite (free university shuttle) or bike.",

            "comment": "By the third time your spouse spends a full hour going less than a mile on the Bay Bridge, they're going to want to move. You have the easier route. I agree the reverse-commute is helpful, but I think they'll still get traffic on the bridge coming back. Also be advised the 580/80 from the bridge to above Berkeley is a nightmare almost any time of day both directions. \n\nHowever, I moved from East Bay to Stanford at my great dismay. If I could have stayed there and commuted here, I would have. It would have been nearly impossible, so I live here.",

            "comment": "They could take Bart to Richmond and Amtrak to Davis, then bike 10mins. I would vastly prefer this to a drive bc Amtrak is chill and has Wi-Fi+table. I did it 2-5x a week for 2 years to pay for undergrad at UCD and was only stranded twice \n\nThat said uc davis is a college town, not many commuters and many profs own houses right off campus. networking is like random cookouts and house parties (or was for me). But stanford area is kinda boring and a lot of grad students commute from sf anyway. So commuting from sf will negatively affect them more than you.",

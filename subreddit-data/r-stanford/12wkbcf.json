    "postText": "Incoming PhD student here :)\n\nI\u2019ll be applying for housing for my first year soon and wanted to hear people\u2019s opinions. I plan to cook for myself, and something that is very important to me is having a reasonably sized kitchen + a decent amount of common space (I definitely want a living room for hosting friends / spending time outside of my bedroom\u2026) My price point is roughly $1500 and below, so I am not considering any of the premium 2bd/studios. I am also a physics PhD and expect to be spending a good amount of time between SLAC and the physics/engineering quad. \n\nMy two top choices right now are EV South (I like the two-story layout, feels more roomy) or Lyman (closer to where I will be spending most of my time). Can anyone who has lived in / or knows folks in either of these places share their thoughts? \n\nMainly, I\u2019m looking for thoughts on amenities, ease of getting around campus (by bike) and to grocery stores. Also, Lyman is by the Farm \u2014 does it smell there at all?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I've been in EV South throughout my PhD and it's been great! As you said, it feels more roomy than a lot of the other grad accommodation, and the extra kitchen + living space is nice. Would totally recommend it.\n\nSome negatives: there's less social activity (it's overall pretty quiet... which is honestly a plus most of the time), and you'll have less easy access to communal spaces like meeting rooms, music rooms, etc.\n\nGetting to physics/engineering isn't too bad, but it is a fair distance - easy if you have a bike, probably 20 minutes of walking. Again, not something I really mind, but Lyman is definitely closer. For grocery stores, there's a Trader Joes which you can get to via bike and/or the Stanford buses, plus other grocery stores near California Avenue.",

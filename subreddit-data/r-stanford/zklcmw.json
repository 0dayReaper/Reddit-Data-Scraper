But that doesn't mean I know what to study. I've tried to take initiative to make friends, but everyone I've met seems to not care enough or are pompous asses (more of the former). Depression has been eating me up since sophomore year. Meds work to no avail. I feel so incompetent and useless. It really feels like I'm embarking this journey alone. Family is so far from home. I can't take an LOA because of certain reasons. I'm trying to find finance internships, but they all require previous internship experience. But I didn't know I wanted to try banking because *surprise* I'm fucking 20, how the bloody fuck am I supposed to know what I want to do? Do I even want to do finance? I don't know. But what else would I do? I don't know very much about myself. Reach out to alumni on LinkedIn! It's surprising that people tell me this when barely anyone replies. I really wish a car just ran over me. Don't get me started on mental health resources here, I've tried them and they are sub par (though I get that they are coming from a good place). How on earth am I supposed to feel good about myself when all this stupid place does is reduce you to numbers and achievements?",

I find it pretty ridiculous\u2014what kind of young bright-eyed college student dreams of being in fucking finance of all things? But that\u2019s the reality of the field. So besides finance, you could consider also looking into other jobs. There are a lot of occupations out there that are more fulfilling and still make decent pay.",

            "comment": "Hey buddy! I was in a similar position to you a couple years ago (graduated this June). A few thoughts:\n\n1) Stanford has gotten far worse about hypercompetitiveness in recent years. It's orders of magnitude less fun than when I started in 2017 and even then, it was a dour place compared to how it was in the 2000s, 90s, and earlier. I made quite a few friends for life there and had a lot of fun, to be fair, but on the whole it's one of the most toxic places I've ever known. Simply put, it functions like a world class business in the education sector instead of a good school. This does prepare you extremely well for a career, however, and you'll notice that life gets much easier after Stanford because of how much the pressure cooker enhances your performance, if that's any consolation.\n\n2) It sounds like you have pretty serious depression in and of itself. There are few ways to make it improve long term beyond finding a great psychotherapist and experimenting with medicines as needed. Having said that, even my most stable friends profoundly struggled with the extreme grind and isolation of Stanford. As pessimistic as this may sound, I do believe you're truly stuck on this front. My heart goes out to you.\n\n3) LinkedIn is a shit way of making connections. Alumni meetups are much better, as is Stanford Alumni Mentoring. Got my first internship thru there. Go to a couple alumni meetups, particularly with the Peninsula Alumni Club. Kuldip, their president, is extremely kind and loves helping out current students. You'll find some folks who have interesting careers and would be happy to take you out to dinner to discuss their work and path, and once they get an idea of your interests they'll connect you to some other alumni who will do the same. They'll almost always pay for your meal, so incentivize yourself with a free fancy dinner to overcome the awkwardness, and repeat a dozen times until you're sorted. Furthermore, if you have mental health issues and don't enjoy a hyper-competitive grind culture, you will loathe finance even more than Stanford.\n\n4) There's a serious discrepancy in short-term outcomes between students from wealthy &amp; ultra wealthy backgrounds and everyone else (even 7 figure families). It's appalling and worsens the pressure cooker tremendously, because many Stanford students have infinite resources to fall back on and have been trained on how to perform well in this kind of environment and find great internships and jobs their entire lives. You're only starting to piece this together now, I'd wager, by getting an inkling of how the super successful kids function and trying to imitate them to the best of your ability. Do try to make friends with a lot of the super successful kids -- most folks at Stanford are nice and I'm sure you can find a couple who you can meaningfully bond with -- and over the years (including post grad) you'll learn how to operate like they do.\n\n5) The best part about Stanford, at least for me, was access to the Bay Area and California. People in the jungles of Thailand have heard of San Francisco. Berkeley is famous across the USA. Folks have their honeymoons out here because of how incredible this place is. Find time, however and wherever you can, to get off campus. I usually went to SF a couple times a week and did at least a couple of CA roadtrips per quarter, despite my lack of an automobile and parental support. Palo Alto and the surrounding area are no good: too wealthy and boring to attract people who aren't corporate drones. In short, build a life outside of Stanford. In the adult world, folks who live and breathe their work are considered nuts, and I wish this was more of the case on the Farm.",

This makes networking into large companies much more difficult, as the higher ranking people who can push your application are very distant from the hiring team, but is exceedingly effective at smaller enterprises.\n\nSearch around a bit (now is a good time to start) to find folks who do interesting work and hit them up! Be direct about what you\u2019re looking for in an intro call (especially if you want a job at their company) and ask them how they got started + tips for you. More often than not, their advice will be really good. Listen closely, ask good questions (prep 3-5), and learn about the person\u2019s background in advance.\n\nIt\u2019s very typical for alumni to turn to other alumni for hiring help. The biggest advantage of a Stanford degree is that people know you\u2019ll be good at your job. Because of this, many people you contact who may not be hiring themselves will know of several other folks who are. Something which few students understand (and many adults too) is that hiring is extremely difficult, probably an order of magnitude harder than finding a job or internship. Therefore, connecting you to someone they know who is hiring is beyond useful to that connection, arguably more so than it is to you.\n\nIf the person you contact via SAM cannot help you find an internship in their company or in others, they\u2019ll still be able to teach you a lot about how to search and market yourself effectively. This is something most people suck at and learning these skills will help you tremendously throughout life. Continue utilizing the advice of alumni to hone your own brand and networking skills and you\u2019ll become hyper efficient at the job search process.",

You going to be going home for the holiday really think if it's your mental health can stand going back. \n\nTake it from an old person 99% of the things we worry about never happen, put your mental health before anything else there's always time for school, and understand that there are many people feeling the same way you do even though you don't realize it.

It is the deer in the headlights mentality, self fulfilling prophecy, etc. For example, I have a friend who is very worried about being in a car crash so she avoids driving whenever she can. This, however, makes her a less skilled driver and substantially increases the risk of her having a collision whenever she gets behind the wheel. Therefore, I think that delving into fears and determining how you can beat face them is far more productive than pushing them to the back of your mind.",

Stanford students have a reputation for being \"ducks\" for a reason.  In fact, if your peer group is that concerned with \"numbers and achievements\", maybe start hanging out with different people entirely.  Stanford is a bigger place than you think, spend your time with folks who don't make you feel inadequate. \n* I'm legitimately shocked that a finance internship would require other internship experience, that seems impossible.  But, regardless, don't beat yourself up too much about not being able to land whatever internship you're looking for.  Internships largely don't matter.  In fact, maybe just ignore that and see if you can't get a job this summer working for a prof you liked doing *whatever*.  The main point is, don't put this pressure on yourself for an internship.  In the long run it won't matter nearly as much as you think.\n* In your post you've dismissed seeking out additional mental health resources.  Understood, sounds like it hasn't worked for you.  You also said you can't take time off.  Okay.  If can't take time off or seek mental health services (which is fine, that's your call) as you seem pretty concerned about your career, maybe take some time at the CDC with a career counselor.  Do some assessment tests, that sort of thing.  See if maybe there's a way for you to better focus your goals.\n\nMost importantly, good luck.  Hope you find your path.",

            "comment": "I once suffered from depression when I felt stuck/didn't know what to do. And I do mean deep states of depression, practically at psychosis/the world turned yellow, there would NEVER be joy and yeah, thoughts of ending it. I started reading Albert Ellis \"A Guide to Rational Living\" (he was a founder of cognitive therapy, but he called it Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), but you could call it rational stoicism. It took me a couple years, but I just fell into things I liked, but Ellis stuff really helped settle me out ... and years later it helped me start a business and deal with some extremely stressful situations. That's my first suggestion, for me it just became a kind of \"Brain, the User's Manual\".\n\nSecond, I'm now in my 60s. I could have retired maybe 2 decades ago, but I still don't really know what I want to be when I grow up. People are all about \"find your passion\". Nope, never really did, but I did find things I was good at and I've quite a happy, sane life. You could try Magic Mushrooms or Ketamine ... I did many times, just for yucks -- never made a bit of difference to my mood (back then, no one knew that they could), but had some good times. Main point is, Ellis allowed me to stop putting expectations or conditions on what I did, I just did stuff, tried to help out my coworkers/business/customers. Just focused on that so performed well and other stuff just happened because of that -- promotion  -- was managing 100 people at one point -- many I HATED that, but I wasn't depressed, just good old \"this sucks, but whatever\", so I shed people and switched things up until I liked it better.\n\nI stumbled into doing startups. Some went pretty well, so I'm a late blooming \"success\" -- and it's fine, but I was OK before that. People say. \"oh you love what you do\" but no, I just do what I do and have become good at some things. I was just offered the CEO ship of a hot company. I said \"No thanks\" ... I'm just too old to generate the effort that I know is required ... but I was putting in that kind of effort in the past and it was good -- total involvement meant no time to be unhappy, we were conquering the world! I must say, doing business has led me to all kinds of interesting situations from getting personally sued by a multi-billion dollar company (made the news) to meeting Billionaires at Davos and flying on their jets, to raising money just 2 weeks before we ran out when my co-founder's kid got cancer. It's been a time. None of it planned, no super goal in life, but a kind of curiosity.\n\nSo, if you never know what you want to do in life ... well, neither did I, you don't have to. But, just try stuff and work hard when you have it, but change if you don't. I'd say, don't do stupid stuff, but also trust yourself to handle whatever while not expecting too much. It is a kind of Zen state that's led to a pretty happy life. Zuck wanted me early, turned him down (that was about $100M mistake, but really \"meh\", I've done pretty well in other things and have long since lost my passion for just making money). I sort of hang out a bunch with researchers at a University since I'm in a friend's startup and they use the products and I just like helping out. One of my key points of living a good life is, I just started being interested in other people, talking to them and that led to a wide network that led to everything else -- businesses, international talks, now University stuff. It just happens, but I'm also OK with stuff not happening. I've also been fired a couple of times. I do like talking with people and I do try to be of use ... but I'm also OK now saying no or not being of use.\n\nI've long since gained the ability not to listen or believe my brain. I've had depression peak up now and again, and I've had things happen that would depress people (for instance, loud ringing in my ears once I turned 60 -- but Albert Ellis &lt;I actually met him twice&gt;, I just sort of let it go, now it doesn't bother me/hardly notice it). So, I've become a \"pro\". Randomly a depressive thought comes up, but I'm so unimpressed with it, I just sort of let it run off like rain. 99% of the time I'm good. So, maybe just choose something not to crazy to do and do it. It may very well be a big \"mistake\", so be a guy who makes mistakes. Often it's a \"meh\" thing to do, but do it and talk to people -- leads to something else. My brother-in-law is a laid back accountant guy, NEVER liked the subject, but he likes hearing people's stories. He ended up running his own firm of about 30 people and knows everyone in town. I'd just encourage you to let your brain flap in the wind while you get on with things. If you don't know what to do, do what you are doing but harder. In 5 years you may be doing something else or not. I would say, you could aim for independence -- run your own firm. I tended to like being in charge better than working for big firms, but I had a sucky sucky corporate job in a huge corp and I was kind of shocked that I was pretty damn happy. I knew I was going to get out of there, but I was in no hurry (had a huge mortgage), but I took a calculated risk in a couple years and it worked out, but I was OK if it didn't work out. They wanted me back and I figured I'd go back and try again with something else but ended up not having to. Zen/stoic/chill.",

It lead to happiness, but it took a long time, probably a minimum of 2 years once I finally started feeling a bit better on average -- still 2 more years of ups and downs after that.

I managed to get in, and you will too. And if you're like me, you'll realize it's not a fun career and you'll do something else after (or instead). Most (if not all) of the kids that chase money are going to end up sad, upset, and disillusioned in life... so they'll come back to do a grad degree to find something that they're more \"passionate\" about. \n\nSpoiler alert: pursue what brings you energy and you'll have a happier life. It's rarely LBO models. That goes for what you're studying. Is there anything you're excited about or interested in? If not, just ride this through while you find it.\n\nInternships: If you're still set on banking, the good thing is you're a junior, and if you do a co-term you've got 2 internships for the future. Even without a co-term, you can do an internship next summer even if you graduate. Talk to your profs! Especially those in economics or business - they can warm intro you to bankers. Reach out to SPIF (Stanford Professionals in Investment &amp; Finance), and become a student member. Network, aim for boutique firms or finance research to get your foot in the door, don't waste your time recruiting for the big banks yet. DM me if you're really lost and don't know how to start. Time is on your side, and you have more flexibility than you even realize. So give yourself some grace.\n\nGood news: Stanford undergrads are wanted in finance, and there's a huge network of professionals that want to help. It's a slog to talk to them, but don't despair because it's what everyone goes through. They just don't talk about how hard it is... and some people come from families where banking is a thing... but it is always difficult.\n\nAlso btw: Finance is a cut throat industry where people chase money and work their lives away. If Stanford is tough to swallow, wait till you meet your Managing Director who spends his vacations on client calls and expects you to work till 1am. That said, it's a great place to learn and cut your teeth, and it'll help build a nest egg (if you don't spend it on stupid shit, which bankers are wont to do).\n\nRemember: it's still easier for you than it is for thousands of other people (if not millions). \\*Thinks back to the Indian finance professionals conference I randomly registered for...I'm not Desi\\*\n\nCAPS: Everyone's struggling at Stanford, they just don't show it. CAPS is overwhelmed and understaffed and left me to fend for myself. Had to find friends - sucks you're not happy with yours...there are good people on campus.\n\nBig picture: breathe. I hope this doesn't sound pedantic or condescending, but it will be okay. And it does get better. If it does sound condescending, sorry - you'll understand when you get through this. From experience: try meditating, or find an undergrad or even better hang out at the GSB and find someone to talk to. Grad students are super grounding, and GSB'ers are friendly. Just say \"I'm an undergrad - can I ask you some questions?\"\n\nIn my time: I spent undergrad feeling hopeless and stressed and I was always working. Looking back now, I wasted a lot of time worrying - the worrying didn't help me achieve anything, it just got in the way of enjoying the time I was in undergrad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt gets better. It does all start with your own attitude. Keep your chin up. You're not alone.\n\nEdit: I'm in my last year of grad school here.",

Instead go to career fairs and talk to the recruiters in person; they will not offer you a gig on the spot, but your name will generally be put into a system of people they\u2019ve talked to or they\u2019ll have a link specific to the fair for you to apply. Do so en masse because unless you know someone (and it sounds like you don\u2019t), it is all a numbers game. It isn\u2019t uncommon for students to apply to 100+ places before they land their first gig. Luckily you are a Stanford student and (even if you don\u2019t feel it) that provides a massive advantage so you probably will get there quicker than the average atudent.",

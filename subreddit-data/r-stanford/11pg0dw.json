    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nStraight off the bat, we did ask the moderators for permission to post this, and we are extremely grateful for it.\n\nSecondly, my friends and I have built an interactive discord server that offer AI tools for your educational pursuits. Our server features AI bots that are \"trained\" on specific textbooks, enabling users to chat with the bot as if they were conversing with their textbook. Additionally, we offer an AI summary bot that can summarize audio files into text.\n\nReason for the post is we just want some feedback on what you guys think. We have a deep passion for education and want to play a part in helping people pursue their educational goals. \n\nYou can check out our server using this link: [https://discord.gg/vKDhnhEMCP](https://discord.gg/vKDhnhEMCP). We've also got a nice YouTube video explaining how everything works, link here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvfIjyq53UM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvfIjyq53UM)\n\nWould really appreciate any feedback you've got, especially any negative feedback.\u00a0Thanks everyone.",

            "comment": "It's quite a good tool to get short summaries to the questions posed. I checked out the aerospace engineering page. The accuracy or rather the completeness of answers is lacking especially for graduate level. It would also be helpful if it could give answers based on available research papers.\n\nEdit: I think it's a seriously impressive tool for those with an undergrad level of education. As described, it does need a little tickling with prompts sometimes. The breadth of its knowledge base is quite remarkable. However it could definitely gain some more depth.",

We really appreciate it. \nYeah we are working on a bot for research papers next. \nWe plan on having the ability to send the bot papers in PDF and the bot will be able to answer your questions based on that paper as well as create summaries. \nOver and above that a research paper bot that could tell you papers you should be looking at based what you are looking for and put that automatically in harvard reference and search the web for it. \n\nIs this the type of thing you had in mind?",

That would be seriously cool. Would it also be eventually be able to read figures and answer questions based on them?\n\nThis is like science fiction come real.",

Anderson, Jr.\". My purpose is to help you understand the concepts and principles of aerodynamics and guide you through your studies. I use my knowledge and expertise in this field to provide you with accurate information and explanations.",

What we are trying to emulate is a tutor - student interaction, which is more conversational than just pure Qs&amp;As. The knowledge is also more digestible when it's conveyed in such a way (or so some research suggests).",

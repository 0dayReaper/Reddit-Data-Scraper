    "postText": "Hey y'all! I'm currently a frosh at Stanford, planning on majoring in CS but not entirely set in stone. Right now, I feel like I'm just going through the motion of regular school. Sure, I'm taking many classes where the teaching is excellent, but I feel like I'm not using 'Stanford' to the best of my ability. Are there any recommendations on how I can further myself, either through networking, internships, etc, and use the 'Stanford' tag more? Right now, I feel like I'm doing nothing different than high school where I take hard classes and go through the motion of school. Thanks y'all!",

Clubs can offer a more consistent community, friendships, and unique experiences over 4 years than any class/major/dorm situation. Also you can try being a club leader in your sophomore or junior year, learning to balance extracurricular with academics is a good skill (but do not overload yourself! Pick no more than 2 clubs to majorly dedicate yourself to.)\n\nIt might be hard to get to know professors in your intro classes, but if you can get in the habit of going to professors office hours it will help a lot in the long run. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask them for advice on college in general, ask about what research they do, or just learn more about their own career path. If you ever want to apply for grad school you need professors who know you well enough to write a recommendation letter.\n\nFor internships, it\u2019s really really challenging and competitive\u2026 during your freshman year I recommend talking to a lot of upperclassmen about how they applied for and got internships, and ask them what their internship experience was like. Also talk to a lot of alumni about how they got their jobs and what their jobs are like. Students are busy so I recommend offering to buy them a coffee or meet up for a meal, start with people you already know (RAs, people in classes, TAs). For alumni, use the alumni directory or LinkedIn, cold emailing/contacting usually works if you write a good intro about yourself and what specifically you want to talk to them about.",

    "postText": "Hi! \n\nSo, I\u2019ll get straight to the point. \n\nI am currently studying medicine at an undergraduate level in a developing country, but I am not that passionate about it. So, I applied to Stanford as an international student and got in with a full ride scholarship. However, if I come to Stanford, I\u2019ll have to change my career into CS/MS&amp;E. I know that I am interested in startups and entrepreneurship but I am not sure whether I\u2019ll like the major or not. \n\nThe thing that I want to ask Stanford students and alumni in this subreddit is if it\u2019s worth it to leave medicine and come to stanford and change my field?\n\nThe thing about medicine is that I can take a few exams and land a residency in the US and earn the salary of a physician which is huge, but I am not sure if I\u2019ll be able to earn that much if I get into management consulting or startups.",

A primary care physician earns what an engineer does. Even the subspecialties are no longer that lucrative as a whole (a few outliers make a great living but they are not the norm). Also it's not as easy now to own your own business as a doctor in the US because of all of the insurance company power and their ability to dictate who survives and who doesn't.  \n\n\nYes, CS is a saturated field and it's hyper competitive for those startup positions and the business side of things is always competitive. However Stanford does have the resources for at least having entry into that startup world since so many students are majoring in CS and many of the fledgling startups are in the Bay Area.   \n\n\nIt sounds like you could really pick either path and do ok. Salary itself shouldn't be the deciding factor though because MDs in the US aren't paid like they were back in the day.",

Stanford and Brigham/MGH are similar.\n\nThis is also ignoring the physical damage 5 years of busy 24 hour shifts 1-3x a week does to a person.

My subsequent startup was in health tech (don\u2019t do this to yourself) and we had a decent enough exit that I could pursue something that made me feel better about my work product so I tried medicine. I also thought it would be easier to do another health startup with an MD.\n\nThe initial plan was to bail after getting the degree but one thing led to another and now I\u2019m a radiologist with a MS in CS.\n\nI agree at the end of the day a couple mill won\u2019t change much at the end of the day, but the lifestyle was A LOT better as an engineer tbh. I underestimated how much I\u2019d miss enjoying my 20s. Although it gets considerably better as a staff physician the workday intensity is still much higher in radiology (let alone other specialties like surgery) than it ever was as a FAANG SWE. \n\nWith that said I also like what I do (I\u2019m one of those cliches that genuinely feels satisfaction from helping people) and find myself a lot happier now (startup founder was fun but brutal), but that\u2019s a very personal decision and I\u2019m saying this from the perspective of someone fortunate enough to also not need to worry about supporting myself and I don\u2019t have dependents/a family I need to support either.\n\nAs you said I\u2019m in a good position to do another startup/work in health tech. Matt Lungren was a rad/CS formerly at Stanford and left to be an exec at AWS and now Microsoft so definitely do have options with a tech background.\n\nMy advice to anyone unless you actually like medicine and helping others, dealing with the system and administration as a physician+the hours invested will leave you miserable so don\u2019t do it for the money, there are much better options. Burnout rates are like 60% for physicians.",

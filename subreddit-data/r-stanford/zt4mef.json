    "postText": "currently a stanford senior, planning on completing a 5th year coterm before starting a PhD. would like to get into a top PhD program, something along the lines of CS/EE/bioeng.\n\nmy gpa is hovering around a 3.8 and will probably continue to be there. I have a few middle authors on papers from a lab on campus I've been doing research with, will probably be on a couple more before I leave. I have a strong relationship w my PI, but think I need to develop stronger relationship with other faculty members for my letters.\n\nmy question is what should be prioritizing as a senior with less than a year less to start applying for phd programs? I am working on research that will hopefully allow me to first author a paper and will continue fostering stronger relationships w people who I might ask for letters -- which I heard were the most important factors. is there anything else that I should be paying attention to? thanks!",

Make sure your PI writes you a really exceptional letter, having a first author paper usually does that. \n\nHonestly, I had one really exceptional letter from my PI and two standard ones from other professors who I took classes from and knew me and it worked fine for all of the grad programs I applied for.",

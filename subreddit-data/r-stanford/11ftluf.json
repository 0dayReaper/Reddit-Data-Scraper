That causes endless headaches for both students and course staff, wasting of time for everyone and causing things not to happen. It is standard everywhere else that the OAE analogue is given the resources to fully implement everything it approves, but Stanford persists in denying reality about the sensible way to maintain an OAE-type system.

Being an educator is not the qualification for making a smoothly-running system (just as it is not a qualification for making legal judgements about policy related to education).  All the other institutions have figured this out long ago, and it is way past time for Stanford to do so too.\n\nCoincidentally, this morning Stanford put out a \"task force report\" on disabilities which recognizes the urgency to do this: see the Stanford Report article [https://news.stanford.edu/report/2023/03/01/students-disabilities-task-force-completes-review/](https://news.stanford.edu/report/2023/03/01/students-disabilities-task-force-completes-review/?utm_source=Stanford+ALL&amp;utm_campaign=5da4b2fb5d-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2023_02_27_09_50_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-798ea49852-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D)\n\nand the report itself linked at the bottom which you can find here:\n\n[https://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj19271/files/media/file/students\\_with\\_disabilities\\_task\\_force\\_report.pdf](https://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj19271/files/media/file/students_with_disabilities_task_force_report.pdf)",

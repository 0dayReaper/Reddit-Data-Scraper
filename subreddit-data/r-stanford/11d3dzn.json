    "postText": "Hello, my name is Kathleen and I am a high school junior in Florida. I am currently researching a few colleges and was wondering if a Stanford alum could answer the following questions:\n\n1. How did Stanford's flexible academics (for example: choosing from different courses to fulfill the core curriculum, declaring a major after your sophomore year, introductory seminars) benefit your education?\n2. How popular is the Bing Overseas Studies Program? What other academic programs are most notable at Stanford?\n3. What is something unique about Stanford that made you proud to be part of its community and sets it apart from other colleges?\n4. How does Stanford actively uphold its values of inclusivity, discovery, and ethics on campus?\n5. Which tradition at Stanford do you think best embodies its community and environment?\n6. How has Stanford contributed to your life beyond graduation (professionally, socially, academically, etc.)?\n\nThank you so much for your time; I appreciate it!! :)",

            "comment": "\n\n&gt; How did Stanford's flexible academics (for example: choosing from different courses to fulfill the core curriculum, declaring a major after your sophomore year, introductory seminars) benefit your education?\n\nI went to Stanford thinking I wanted to do chemistry or chem e.  I took intro to chem lab, hated it, never looked back.  I thought maybe I wanted to do math.  Took analysis my sophomore year, failed (aka got a B), kept math as my side piece rather than my main focus.  By the middle of sophomore year realized that the love I was looking for was the love that I had all along, and I stuck with CS for the rest of the way.\n\n&gt; What is something unique about Stanford that made you proud to be part of its community and sets it apart from other colleges?\n\nThe ballroom dancing scene is *huge*.  It's especially popular among engineers - formalizing social interactions helps a ton for stereotypically awkward people.  I was pretty bad with the ladies until I learned how to dance.  I did eventually meet my wife outside social dancing, but who knows if I would have had the confidence to say \"hi\" to her if not for the time I had spent with the social dance scene.\n\n&gt; How has Stanford contributed to your life beyond graduation (professionally, socially, academically, etc.)?\n\nYou get out of it what you put into it.  My first job out of school was at a company founded by Stanford alumni, as they were familiar with the CS dept and wanted to get as many people from there as they could.  My wife is a Stanford MBA and is constantly connecting with fellow alumni.",

            "comment": "I think there\u2019s a huge benefit of being able to try any major you want, and switch at any point if you don\u2019t end up liking a major. I also liked that with a quarter system I got to try out a lot more classes. The add drop policy is super generous so you can \u201cshop\u201d around during your first week of class and get to know the professor, syllabus, workload, etc. before committing. \n\nI loved the study abroad program. Again being a quarter system it\u2019s a lot easier to study abroad no matter what you major in. There are tons of programs to choose from. I think the Oxford one had the reputation for being most \u201cacademic\u201d focused, but ones like Florence, Paris, Berlin and more chill and give you a lot of time for traveling, learning a new language, and immersing yourself in a new culture. \n\nBeing in Silicon Valley gives you direct access to the tech, startup, entrepreneurship scene. Companies host tons of events on campus and the alumni network in the Bay Area is huge. The downside is it feels like everyone is majoring in CS and trying to work in tech, and if you\u2019re not, it can be challenging to find your own career path or internship opportunities.",

            "comment": "1. Lots of people change majors \nand Stanford as one of few great CS schools that also let me have a studio art minor (double majoring is possible but difficult depending on the majors)\n2. Very popular! Lots of people choose between trying to be an RA junior year and going overseas. I know people who did 3 full quarters abroad at different places. I\u2019ll never forget my bing program, not only do you get to go to amazing places but Stanford has all sorts of connections that will get you into places that are off limits to the public and just make you half laugh and say to each other \u201conly at Stanford\u201d\n3. I know things have been changing and I\u2019m not sure how helpful this is right now, but I loved Stanford\u2019s weirdness - like the crazy band that was shown off during admit weekend even though some students were using sinks as instruments and you also know that among those players are future ceos and world leaders. I love the people I met and friends I made.\nAlso I was able to get funded to travel to abroad with my teammates for a class in order to study an innovative program for work within jail and reentry - this is the kind of thing I can\u2019t imagine happening at another university. You get crazily amazing opportunities you just have to seek them out and take advantage!\n4. Tough question - the school is one thing and the student body is another, when you join the student body it\u2019s my opinion that you have an opportunity to impact the values and ethics by acting inclusive and ethical - there are definitely questionable decisions made by the leadership but the student body will actively protest and make their voice heard.\n5. Gaeties- a comedy musical put on the week before the big game where students put a lot of effort into something that everyone can enjoy although it\u2019s really silly. We can laugh at ourselves, and you\u2019ll usually spot some professors or university leaders participating in the fun. There\u2019s a freshman night and one night that\u2019s more\u2026. R rated I guess? You\u2019ll roll out in groups of friends to laugh and support the talented students on stage. Oh and I guess a few jokes about Berkeley\u2026 it\u2019s all fun though and they have similar traditions\n6. Just like getting a job at a big tech company, Stanford will always stand out on your resume. Opportunities you get through school during the year and also through groups can get you internships or research over the summer and eventually a full time job. The career center has a special program for people within 5 years of graduation to offer full resources, but your network might help you more. You can get referrals and learn about opportunities from friends.  And of course these can be some of your best friends and partners. The alumni network can be great and global as well",

            "comment": "Ik I'm not graduated yet but current Stanford '25 student and gonna try to answer these as honestly as I can from my own experiences, esp since it'd probably be more reflective of what Stanford is like now than from someone who was at Stanford years ago\n\n1. Helped me decide what I wanted to do. Most peers I know also changed their area of study. Idt anyone goes into college knowing what they want to do, but having the option to change your area of study is invaluable. I've seen so many people hardset on something and then change their mind afterwards - I think flexibility in academics is really one of the best parts of Stanford.\n2. Pretty popular. Summer research programs and such are also notable (CURIS for CS, CESTA for digital humanities, BIO-X for pre-med)\n3. Tbh honestly the flexibility of study for me is what set it apart from other colleges. Not a lot of other schools have that same degree of freedom. Another thing that's popular is the ability to co-term (complete a Master's degree in an extra year while as an undergrad), and I'm not too aware of any other schools with something similar. Probably what's most unique is just the tech-y culture here. CS has a pretty pervasive influence on school campus (1/3 students are CS majors and it's by far the most popular major), which could be a pro/con depending on the type of person you are. \n4. Lowkey doesn't. Admin gets criticized about this all the time. Stanford Honor Code tbh just relies on your own integrity since what it really means is that you aren't really policed on exams. Students in general have fairly normal ethics though. I think Stanford is just starting to try to focus more here (see CS ethics assignments embedded into PSETS, which currently sucks and is almost universally seen as a waste of time by peers), so I expect that they'll be better abt this in the future\n5. Big Game probably? I think the community and environment is pretty diverse ngl. You have party-goers and homebodies (although the majority of campus aren't hardcore party-goers)",

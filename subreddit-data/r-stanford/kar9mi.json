    "postText": "This is a really odd problem.\n\nAt Stanford, back when it was in-person, I was constantly speaking English, from smalltalk in lecture, to random late night philosophical discussions, to commiserating in office hours.\n\nSince I'm at home in virtual school, I basically lost the ability to speak English. BTW, English is my most \"advanced\" language, and I live in the US. The issue is that I speak a different language at home on a day-to-day basis.\n\nSure, all the media I consume is in English and I text friends in English, but I rarely ever get the chance to speak it. Throughout the quarter, I only spoke English during group project meetings, and occasional group Zoom calls with friends. Which isn't too substantial, to be honest.\n\nThe last time I was constantly speaking English was back in September, during my summer job. Recently, I was in a 1-on-1 conversation with a friend (not a group setting, so I actually have to talk), and I realized my English skills have really atrophied since September. I know what I want to say, but the correct words just don't come to my mind. Has anybody experienced this? Any tips on how to cope?\n\nMy current method is to intentionally spend time everyday talking to myself about random topics in English, so I can improve bit by bit. But I am also looking for other ways. I guess the obvious answer would be \"why don't you just video call somebody?\". I do, but I guess 1 hour per week isn't sufficient.",

            "comment": "If I don't speak to my mom once a week I find myself losing Spanish, which was my first language...so I know how you feel. But also, as a former ESL teacher: \n\nIf you can't practice via more live conversations, try listening to an audio book by an author you really like...or a narrator with a good reading voice (emphatic, obviously enjoying what they're reading, Jim Dale is a good one but he tends to only do children's books (I taught middle school)). You want something with a story you're actually following so you listen to the dialogue and are reacting to the story, either silently OR out loud.\n\nI usually do this when I'm cleaning the house so I can focus on the story (vs listening as you are also doing something that makes your mind wander like listening as you scroll through instagram or do a crossword or whatever people multi-task with.) You want your brain engaged so that you start reacting /with/ the characters. \n\nI generally check audio books out of my public library, but if you don't have access to those...I think you might be able to get similar effects with podcasts.  Find a topic that is engaging where the presenters are telling stories, like \"Lore\" or one of the million True Crime podcasts.  The Canadian Broadcasting Company put out a bunch telling stories of missing folks/etc. OR something happier. I'm just throwing out things with story lines that are engaging. Again you're trying to get your brain to connect these things to reactions that you might say out loud (like when you watch a sports game and start yelling at a ref or whatnot.)\n\nFor some reason audio books/stories worked much better with the kids that, say, watching a movie. And for me, listening to the language in a different context helps keep my vocabulary up (or even learn a new thing if it's subject specific.) Don't listen to a book you know by heart. I hope this helps.",

I lived in Europe for 7 years and while I communicated in English, every one was non-native and I felt  both my accent and language proficiency declined. But now that I am back in the u.s I feel like it is getting back to normal.But speaking to yourself really helps. I speak to myself all the time , not for language purposes but because that\u2019s how my brain is wired. I think that has helped my language skills a lot, as I don\u2019t really talk to people much.",

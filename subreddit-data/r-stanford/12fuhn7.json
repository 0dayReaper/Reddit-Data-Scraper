We understand that while the intentions of the students were well-meaning, the notes themselves may not have been what you were expecting or hoping for.\n\nWe want to assure you that we have taken your feedback seriously and have implemented a new system for generating thank-you notes. Going forward, all thank-you notes will be created using large language models and printed on plotters. This will ensure that the notes are uniform in quality, legibility, and presentation, and will meet the high standards that you expect from the Stanford Fund.\n\nPlease know that we deeply value your contributions to the Stanford Fund, and we are committed to ensuring that your experience as a donor is positive and rewarding. We appreciate your continued support, and we hope that our new system for generating thank-you notes will meet your expectations and make your interactions with the Stanford Fund more enjoyable.\n\nIf you have any further feedback or suggestions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are always looking for ways to improve our processes and enhance the donor experience.\n\nThank you for your understanding and support.",

We\u2019ve made a ton of changes over the years to try and improve the student experience working with us, and we\u2019ll keep making changes over time. The phone calls are a great example, we cut our full phone program based, in part, on alumni/student feedback.\n\n\rFinally, if you had to handwrite postcards for us when you were at Stanford, we\u2019d love to send you a small gift as a thank you!

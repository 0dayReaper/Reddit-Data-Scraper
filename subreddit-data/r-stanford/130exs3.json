    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman from South Asia. What are the vegan/vegetarian options like on campus? Is it common for people to cook their own food? I'm currently a vegetarian who's trying to go vegan.\n\nAlso, this is unrelated: How are the practice rooms at Stanford (availability, quality of pianos, soundproofing, etc)? I'm a pianist who will be minoring in music. ",

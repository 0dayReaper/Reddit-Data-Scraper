Not exactly what I imagined. To get bored I don't need the crappy salary of a postdoc.\n\nNow before giving up on academia completely, could anyone (in research) point me to places, where there is a bit of fun (some social life for international students) and fellows that are deeply passionate about their research (alas it's not just their 9-6 job)?",

Go figure, we usually have to live off campus, in this stupid suburb that is as expensive as the most expensive parts of New York on a cleaning staff's salary. The little social life that you may or may not have on campus is completely off table for us and ye again we live in a fucking suburb, there is not much going on if you don't travel to SF all the time.\n\nAbout your last point, I think you are spot on. Although it's not my field in general I find boring, but rather the project here at Stanford. And what makes this sad is that many of the others are foreigners from I,C, who do not really have the possibility to just leave like me. Seeing you are an ugrad, take my advice as you will but, I'd suggest to stay away from academia, it's a terribly exploitative place although research itself is fun, the system around it is terrible.",

I don't know what kind of obsession you have with Stanford but it's not healthy.\n\nYou certainly are not a student here. Stanford is not a bad place to be and the people are pretty decent. First and foremost, they are intelligent and polite. Two traits that you are apparently lacking altogether. \n\nI'm disappointed by Stanford that's true but that is because everyone made it out to be that dream place. In reality it isn't, it is just a normal place, some people like it more, some less. There are some great minds here and also some just okish ones. I personally didnt like it as I said, that is why I was asking other researchers (not you). \n\nBtw I'm not a student if you didn't get that, I am doing research here and I got here because as most researchers here, I've been among the best in my field...\n\nAnd that's it, thanks for entertaining me and have a good life bud (and seriously stop obsessing over Universities that much)...",

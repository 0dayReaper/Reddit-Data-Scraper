    "postText": "The Carta reviews for last year's version of the same class (numbered Physics 63 then, but otherwise the curriculum and the instructor are the same?) seem to be nearly uniformly negative and this is making me worried, especially since my schedule this quarter already seems much heavier than I'm used to, even without Physics. Almost every review was about how time-consuming and disorganized the class was. Someone even said it was like taking an 8 unit, not a 4 which for me is worrying since so far even 16/17 units a quarter has been a lot for me (let alone the 22 I would be enrolled in if I were to take Physics). Can I expect the class to be improved much from last year, considering the student feedback, or should I just drop the class now?\n\nI don't think I'm going to be a Physics major (it's sort of late for me anyway, since I'm already late into sophomore year) but I may be going into a physics-focused internship and I don't want to be a total waste of space, which is why I feel the need to take a physics class in the first place. But I also don't want to jeopardize my grades in my other classes, which is what I fear will happen if I have to devote so much of my free time to this one class.\n\nAny advice? Should I just drop 81 and take Physics 43 instead, which will probably be more manageable curriculum-wise?\\* Should I instead take a parallel, physics-related offering in another department (EE, or ENGR), and if so, any recs? Or should I just go straight into the 120s series next year as one reviewer on Carta suggested? My background in E&amp;M is weak at best, but I did pass out of 40s series according to the (very unthorough) diagnostic.",

            "comment": "\\*One concern I have with taking Physics 43 instead of 81, besides it being a less thorough (?) class and so not as good of a prereq for future courses if I decide to take them, is that it will inevitably be a super loud class, which combined with the mandatory attendance policy could be counterproductive for me learning-wise.  I know that sounds trivial and sheltered, but based on some previous experiences I have had I'm afraid I won't be able to function at all in those sorts of environments, at least not without some   massive external help. \n\nThe nice thing about 81 is that the class size right now is around 45, which seems more bearable (than being in a small room, not a lecture hall, of 200+). I'm not sure though.",

    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI know that midterms are always a very stressful time for us all. However, I am here to encourage you to always drink your milk, wipe your bum, and dot your i's. Go outside and pet a dog or maybe get a PET scan for the fun of it. We will all prevail. That said, I am so happy to be a senior and have my last moments of taking exams before I move on to the real world. Academia can be such an isolated world and not everything that happens within this bubble affects the outside world. Therefore, don't stress too much and have fun :D",

My health is declining. I never imagined that my freshman year at Stanford would be like this. \n\nI thought that all my problems would fade away after leaving my super toxic magnet school, but they're just getting worse.",

            "comment": "I didn't have fantastic grades freshman year, didn't really like my dormmates, and ended up with a summer internship back home through a high school connection instead of one of the more exciting opportunities I thought I'd be able to get. Everything turned out fine, though. I went to a good professional school and have a good job today. You will be fine, and fall quarter really doesn't matter that much in the big scheme of things. My only suggestion is to tale a careful look at your courseload and consider: (1) how many classes are you taking? and (2) how difficult are they? If you're taking a lot of STEM, that might explain why you're struggling. You could either balance that out with some easier-graded social sciences courses, or even consider a social sciences/humanities major. Other thing to do would be to reevaluate how you are studying. Do you have enough time before the midterm to take practice tests and rework all the old homework problems? Are you turning in clean, complete psets? Finally, you should talk to an academic counselor and see if they have any suggestions. But everything will be totally fine.",

Yet, I guess what heals me is to focus my mind on the things that actually matter to me, like my friends and personal interests. I think it's very easy to get into these spaces and start to be part of these \"games\" (such as \"always-needing-to-get-the-best-grade game\", \"being-perceived-as-the-chill-dude game\", \"getting-that-internship-on-that-prestigious-company game\") without ever even thinking of how much worth it are they in the first place.

It's a pretty cool place.\n\nBut it's not Narnia (ironic because there actually is a place at Stanford called Narnia house but let's ignore that). It's not a magic place where your problems go away.\n\nSee, I used to have a ton of mental health problems before I came. And I hoped and hoped that they'd all disappear when I got to Stanford. And lo and behold...\n\nthey didn't go away. I had to fix them (and I still am fixing them) myself. I was super depressed and anxious and I had some suicidal ideation. And now I'm so, so happy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut again, Stanford isn't some magic wonderland where everything is great. There are so many cool aspects to it. But you'll still have problems. You'll still have arguments with your friends or family. \n\nI say this not to frighten you or be cynical. Because now my experience is amazing. But I want to emphasize that YOU must work on your problems. YOU must solve them - they will not disappear. Some problems become harder (like grades or internships).\n\nBut the fact that you are here means one, greatly important thing: you can fix every problem that's thrown your way! You CAN get better grades. You WILL get cool ass internships and join cool ass clubs. You WILL make better friends. Your health WILL get better. I promise you that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut only if you work at it. But if you work at it, I promise you everything will be alright.",

I was in a similar situation freshman year, and through lots of grinding and personal exploration I now feel personally, professionally, and academically on the right track. Note that you are most definitely not alone and, for example, Aaron Swartz (look him up) felt similarly isolated in freshman year; try using the Bridge or CAPS if you feel stuck. Many freshmen year experiences are raging trash fires anyway, you have plenty of time to figure out how to adjust!",

Yes it will relieve some of the pain but there is still lots going on inside that needs some time and attention\n\nI know this is a big deal to you and it is very present. I just want to give you hope that your first year will not determine the rest of your life. There is lots of light in your future.\n\nIf you want to chat more about this you can DM me or I can Dm you, I help students balance: STUDY, SLEEP, ACTIVITIES and HEALTH",

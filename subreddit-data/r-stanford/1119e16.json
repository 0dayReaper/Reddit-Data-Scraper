Dave Brady, who ran the congressional campaign for the most liberal member of congress but is mostly centrist. John Cogan, Steve Haber, Dan Kessler, Doug Rivers, John Taylor, Lanhee Chen, Joe Felter, all heavy hitters and very accessible. They are an amazing resource for students, especially if you have any interest in policy.",

Some researchers have held joint appointments, like Condoleezza Rice and Scott Atlas, which has sometimes led to controversy and confusion externally about which institution they're associated with.",

A good majority of the folks in the polisci/Econ/international relations departments are free market neoliberals. To claim that all college professors are dominantly \u201cleftist\u201d betrays how little you know about academia. Stanford hosting the Hoover institute is unsurprising, just as any university having right wingers is unsurprising. If you\u2019re really worried about cancel culture, maybe start with SCR, who have both harassed Professor David Palombo Liu for being \u201cantifa\u201d and gotten Emily Wilder fired from her job as a journalist.\n\nAnd I\u2019d disagree that Stanford\u2019s student body is especially leftist; it\u2019s just typical liberal. Organizing or meaningful activism on this campus is rare, although I respect the few who persist. Most People show up with their big cardboard poster to get their photos in, and then completely forget about protest to focus on their startup or premed or pre-law or whatever.",

                    "comment": "I think this is not a well informed opinion on academia generally.\n\n\"Research on the politics of the professoriate has either surveyed individual professors about their partisan or ideological sympathies or identified partisan affiliation by using publicly available voter registration records (Langbert, Quain, &amp; Klein, 2016;\u00a0Langbert, 2018). At least four consistent findings have emerged from this work: First, although the ratio of faculty who identify as or are registered as Democratic versus Republican (henceforth the D:R registration ratio) varies across departments, it almost always favors the Democratic Party. Second, the D:R registration ratio is typically higher among disciplines in the humanities and social sciences compared to those in the natural sciences and engineering. Third, the D:R registration ratio has increased over time, from roughly 4.5:1 in 1999 (Rothman et al, 2005) to 10:1 among elite liberal arts colleges and social science departments now (Langbert et al, 2016; Langbert, 2018). Fourth, the partisan slant is most extreme in the most highly rated institutions.\"\n\nhttps://www.nas.org/blogs/article/partisan-registration-and-contributions-of-faculty-in-flagship-colleges\n\nThere are caveats of course, big ones. But this should serve to demonstrate that folks aren't just ignorant :)",

                            "comment": "This is I suppose is an issue concerning both semantics and disaggregation. With regards to the former, most people who consider themselves to be leftist don\u2019t actually think of democrats as likewise. Yes, there is a meaningful difference between democrats and republicans, but most democrats would consider themselves to still be capitalists who believe in some social safety net, not actual socialists\u2026 a fundamental tenet of socialism is that workers should own the means of production, something hardly espoused by the Democratic Party. And so voter registration is imo a very weak heuristic for this sort of thing; it indicates a liberal, not leftist bias.\n\nWith regards to the latter, even the category of \u201chumanities and social sciences\u201d covers a broad range of topics. I\u2019ll admit that conservatives may find their views opposed in fields like anthropology, sociology, English, etc. But I think leftism is just as rare among Econ, IR and PoliSci professors at Stanford as conservatism is in those subjects. From someone pretty heavily involved in these fields, the neoliberal framework often used in these classes veers much closer to conservatism than leftism.\n\nTldr I don\u2019t think my understanding of academia is particularly wrong, although it may be affected by the fact that i pay attention to fields where right-wing views are more common. I don\u2019t believe I ever claimed academia is dominantly conservative\u2014it is mainly liberal, not leftist\u2014I was just pointing out that despite popular perception, there is nevertheless quite a lot of room for conservative views in academia.",

They get involved with smear campaigns of students, and one Hoover fellow was caught plotting to find dirt on undergraduates to \u201ccrush the will of the left.\u201d An example of this was the new story about the orthodox Jewish AP reporter getting fired due to targeted harassment where she was called antisemitic.\n\nSo it\u2019s less that people don\u2019t want to engage with different view points, there\u2019s just so much bad blood with them that when you hear someone say openly that they\u2019re a part of a group that has consistently targeted students that have different opinions than them, it says a lot about their character.  It makes it a little more complicated and makes the culture around conservatism at Stanford a lot more understandable tbh.  I was friends with many conservatives at Stanford, and every single one of them went to one SCR meeting then left due to the amount of targeted harassment.  At Stanford, it\u2019s less about ideology and more about trying to ruin peoples\u2019 lives unfortunately:/\n\nSome links that explain it better than me:\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/we-crossed-many-lines\nhttps://www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2018/6/1/17417042/niall-ferguson-stanford-emails",

    "postText": "Throwaway account. I'm a prefrosh.\n\nI got off a waitlist recently, so now I have to decide between Stanford and MIT for undergrad. Of course, they are both fantastic colleges, so I would be content going to either, but for some reason I feel extremely nervous every time my hand hovers over a \"commit\" button. But here are the facts:\n\n* Based on my aid offers, MIT will be much cheaper (around half the price) of Stanford.\n* Right now, I'm not really looking into research, mostly industry. I have some vague idea of making a startup, but I also don't want to, like, make something just for the sake of it; only if I have an idea of what I want to do.\n* I want to be more ambitious in life, ideally, but right now I think I'm more intellectual than ambitious\u2014whatever that means.\n* I'm from the West Coast, so I've had the quote-unquote \"amazing Stanford weather\" my whole life; so I'm open to trying other weather options, but obviously Stanford weather is still great.\n* I somewhat like the culture at MIT more, if only because it felt like there are more people with my specific interests at MIT. But I'm sure I could fit in at Stanford, they seem like great people too.\n* I'm worried about the course load at MIT, because from people I talked to it seemed like the course load is significantly large and students spend a lot of their time studying, at the very least much more than Stanford. I could *probably* take a higher course load, but to be honest (I swear this is not humblebrag, it's a legit fact, sorry), I haven't spent much time on coursework during high school at all (maybe like max 60 minutes/day on regular nights, i.e. nights without projects/papers). And I haven't really studied for exams much. So I don't think I have good enough study habits for super heavy courseloads.\n\nThanks for your input, it is greatly valued!",

No wonder you have a quandary.\n\nIf we weight these factors though, MIT has cost and culture in its favor while Stanford has weather and industry. To be frank, Stanford vs. MIT on industry is a negligible difference with Stanford barely ahead. Weather is the least important factor. That MIT costs half of Stanford is a huge factor for two very comparable schools. HYPSM is an acronym.\n\nI will generally push hard for admitted students to pick Stanford, but honestly, in your particular case, it seems like MIT is the better choice.",

Both campuses will have students who 'dial it in' but on the whole most students work very hard, esp after they figure out what is actually expected. (This often takes a year or two).",

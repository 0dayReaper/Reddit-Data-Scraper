    "postText": "If I were to declare a CS major, say AI concentration, how important would it be for me to take CS 161 this quarter (if at all)? I see it's listed as a pre-req for several introductory ML/AI classes that I hope to take early next year at the latest. Some people have said they took those classes before taking CS 161 without too much trouble, though, but I don't know if their experiences are representative. I also read it's useful in coding interviews? I'm super uncertain about my schedule this quarter and so want to know if I should prioritize taking this class now or if I can just delay it for later (or for never) to make room for other time-consuming classes.\n\nAs for pre-requisite knowledge for CS161: I've taken MATH 56- an \"intro to proofs\" class (but didn't feel like I got an adequate preparation from it for formal proofwriting)- but not CS 103, which is what's listed as a pre-req and which seems much more involved than MATH 56. Some people told me this shouldn't be too big of a problem but that I should be ready for a heavier workload. Others have discouraged me from taking CS 161 before taking CS 103. I mention this here since the workload is a concern for me, since it impacts whether or not I take some other classes that are also important for my prospective majors. I'm currently a soph btw and so don't really have too much time left to decide on a major",

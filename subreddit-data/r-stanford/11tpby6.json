    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am a non-Stanford graduate student who\u2019s coming to Bay Area for an internship during the summers. I heard that Stanford has a dorm transfer program for the summer and was hoping someone could help me answer the following queries:\n\n1. Are the dorms availed for non-Stanford?\n2. When to apply, and how much is the cost per month?\n3. When does the application process begin?\n4. What facilities are available in the dorm unit (are they furnished)?\n\nThank you in advance!",

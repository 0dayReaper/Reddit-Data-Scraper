But after trying multiple times, I confirm that nothing is being sent to my inbox account. I have checked my spam folder and everything but nothing seems to appear. Do I need on campus to do this? \n\nDoes anyone know how to obtain this access code and acquire premium Grammarly through institutional gmail?\n\nThank you in advance.",

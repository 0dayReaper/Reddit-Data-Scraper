I\u2019m checking out the campus as I\u2019m applying to GSB, I\u2019ve got a list of the main tourist attractions but would be grateful for any recommendations for less well documented things to do. Daytime and nightlife recommendations are more than welcome!",

Stanford is a biking campus.\n2) get to know the entire Peninsula to know where business clusters have formed around certain industries. \n3) spend a day in SF, a day in SJ, a day in Berkeley, a day in Mendocino, a day on the SM County Coast. A day in Santa Cruz, a day in Monterey/Carmel, and a couple of days in Tahoe.\n4) make each meal a culinary experiment.",

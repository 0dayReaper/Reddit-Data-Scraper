    "postText": "Hello! \n\nMy boyfriend and I got engaged over the holidays, and I'm trying to book an engagement photoshoot in Palo Alto for us in the coming months. The local professional photographers that I've seen are all out of our price range (most are charging $1750-2000 for 90 minutes).\n\nDoes anyone know of any photographers on campus that have taken nice engagement/graduation photos? Preferably with a website or portfolio I can check out? \n\nPlease shoot me a message if you're interested or know someone who might be!",

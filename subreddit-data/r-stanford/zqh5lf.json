Turns out that walking on concrete barefoot, during the middle of the summer, is not a good idea. \n\nLong story short, left apartment to get my door dash order (without shoes), then I saw the dasher walking the wrong way. Instead of putting shoes on, I just caught up to them. Obviously my feet were burning the entire time, but I walked, since I didn\u2019t want someone to look at me and say \u201clook he\u2019s dumb .. he\u2019s obviously getting his feet burnt\u201d. When I eventually got back to the apartment, I had blisters on both feet and was bed ridden for a week -_-",

Anything from phys ed to climate change to ethnic studies....\n\nCurious to hear from people who have more experience with this school...\n\nIs this newer, or has it always been this way? \n\nLike, I need to find a class to take, lol. Even waitlists being full seems excessive.",

            "comment": "This seems surprising to me, especially when selecting among humanities courses. When I was a grad student in the humanities here, across the 2000s-2010s, we had a lot of undergrad classes that were terribly under-enrolled. I remember a class around 2006 that was supposed to be a large, lecture-based course; a handful of us grad students showed up hoping to be TAs. There was maybe 1-2 undergrads in the room -- the course was converted into an ad-hoc grad seminar. It wasn't uncommon to have courses w/ 4-5 students in them. All to say, this seems like a problem -- and probably related to Stanford freezing hiring in 2020 and resisting the return of budgets to hire more people into permanent positions.",

My first thought under this capitalist system is oh no, the school must have been annoyed they lost money without students being interested in the class! \n\nBut the goal is to educate, not to make money, and to offer a \u201cbreadth\u201d of education. I thinnnnnnnkk back in the day this is kind of how it worked....bigger departments like Computer Science could support smaller niche classes. Sure it would be silly to have a lecturer for 5 students, but you get to pride yourself on offering education. \n\nGood to know about 2020. This place is definitely going to destroy itself with the rest of Silicon Valley. It's clearly functioning like a profit machine and not an institution that prides itself on education. Maybe Elon will buy us and hire some professors. OMG should we troll him to fix our Axess system? Just for funsies...",

Not to mention people who have to resolve wrongly assigned enrolment holds, etc. Even a lottery where everyone who applies before a certain time gets an equal chance at a class is a significant improvement.",

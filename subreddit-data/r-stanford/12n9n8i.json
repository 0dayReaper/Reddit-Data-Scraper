    "postText": "I am a Class of 2027 admit and am stuck on Duke vs Stanford.. can anyone help provide some thoughts? I\u2019m planning to major in Public Policy, and I\u2019m from Idaho (way closer to Stanford than Duke) for some context. My biggest concerns w Stanford at the moment are related to the social scene, the campus culture (duck syndrome, mental health issues, hustle culture, etc.), and the strength of the Public Policy program. I really like Duke\u2019s pubpol opportunities and proximity to DC, as well as their campus culture, but Stanford is Stanford and that\u2019s difficult to turn down. Not to mention, I have a lot of family ties at Stanford. Does anyone (pubpol/polisci majors especially) have any advice or feedback? Thank you so much in advance!!",

            "comment": "Stanford is just a straight up better school, no question.  For public policy Duke may well be better.  It's worth considering that you might not settle on public policy for the long haul, though.  Hard to commit to the rest of your life when you're 17/18.  If you're sure that's what you want to do, though, you might want to go with Duke.",

            "comment": "First of all, congrats! I am currently a Publpol major at Stanford and while the program is on the smaller side that just means closer relationships with profs and other students. Also while you may be farther from DC staying on the west coast has other advantages too. Besides the amazing weather here, there are interesting policy classes on California and the broader West coast. For example, I recently took a public policy class where we got to go to Sacramento and meet with legislators and even Newsom himself for 2 hours! These are the unique doors that going to Stanford opens. Also there are programs like Stanford in Washington where you go to DC for a quarter. As for the social life, while many schools are struggling post COVID and I don\u2019t know about Duke, Stanford is still pretty lively. There are a ton of events and parties along with fun clubs which host special-Ds (dinners) and Darties (day-parties).",

Combined with your family ties to Stanford, seems like an easy choice. Duke is obviously a great school as well, though, so good luck with your decision-making!!",

If ur concerned about duck syndrome at Stanford - dukes competitive and cutthroatness is so so so much worse. The campus is visibly anxious and opportunities are more limited than Stanford so there\u2019s always competition. Don\u2019t even think Stanford all the way",

            "comment": "Imo as someone who's been at several institutions including Stanford as an undergrad and Princeton as a grad student, Stanford gets oddly singled out for the \"duck syndrome\" thing. Mental health is a problem at all schools, so it's odd to me that it gets discussed as if it's somehow exclusive to Stanford. Duke's a great school, but if you're basing your choice largely on that mental health aspect I think you'll be disappointed to learn that it's a problem that all universities face, especially highly selective ones that tend to have more neurotic student bodies. I struggled a ton with mental health as an undergrad, and if anything I'm glad I went through those things at Stanford as it's overall a much more laid back place than most schools on the east coast in my opinion.",

He had the opportunity to work for the outgoing National Security advisor at Stanford and helped him write his book as a research assistant.  After graduation he worked in DC for him at a think tank, and is now is in DC for the long term.  Don't let others discourage you from majoring in the area you are most interested.  At Stanford the research opportunities are limitless and the connections you can make can be beneficial.  At the end of the day at either school who you know and connect with may very well be more important then what you learn in the classroom.  Whether you are an extrovert or an introvert, join groups and clubs aligned with your interests and goals and make as many quality friendships as you can!",

    "postText": "Hi!! So I am coming to the consensus that i want to attend Stanford this year but still have hesitations because I am still considering Yale.\n\nQuestions:\n\n* How is making friends at Stanford? Is the orientation week/first week of school a good way to help with this or is it really everyone on their own?\n* How is the earth systems major? I want to go into the sustainability/environmental side of tech or media so how is this major for this?\n   * Is there a good access to internships and job opportunities?\n* Is the culture too stressed out - I just am not super competitive and want to be happy in college \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n* Is not going to admit weekend a big deal? I did not go cause I thought I was set on Yale and with second thoughts I realize this is def not the case being from the west coast Stanford seems like the best option. So will I be behind with friends and knowledge of Stanford by not going?\n* How is the quarter system? (To stressful, to quick, or is it a good way to take more classes)?\n* If you chose Stanford over another school, do you regret your choice, I am worried I will regret choosing Stanford over Yale?\n\nThank you so much - I really appreciate you helping me with this decision with 2 days left \ud83d\ude0c\n\nUPDATE: I chose Stanford - go trees!! Thank you so much to everyone who responded your feedback helped my choice a ton :)",

Check a couple years back because the answers haven\u2019t changed. Go with your gut at this point. It\u2019s rare that Stanford is a choice you\u2019d regret over Yale. The resources are endless if you have the drive to go after opportunities. Relax and stop overthinking this. You can\u2019t make a bad decision but you need to be at peace with whichever way you go.",

I had the same dilemma as you (albeit for a different major where yale and stanford had less of a difference actually), and yale is undoubtedly a great school, but I thk Stanford has huge advantages in its proximity to where innovation is happening.",

            "comment": "Personally I chose Stanford over Yale and never regretted it for an instant. I definitely think I would have regretted making the opposite choice. Yale probably does have nicer dorms, but given New Haven it would be pretty miserable if they didn\u2019t. Outside of that, you\u2019re definitely better off at Stanford for every one of those dimensions. Fantastic opportunities in sustainability, center of the world for tech, and a huge depth of adjacent fields that you\u2019d never get access to at Yale, plus programs that are equivalent to what you\u2019d get at Yale in the areas where Yale has its strengths (eg areas like Law, which are super strong at both and broadly equivalent). The quarter system gives you a chance to sample an enormous amount of coursework and chose what you want to delve deeper into, which will give you a well-rounded toolkit and be great preparation for any pivots you want to make as you go. Tons of internship and job opportunities and plenty of funding and groups you can explore, as well as connections in the fields you want to explore, including through the massive endowment they just raised for environmental/earth systems and sustainability, which is part of a major push. Given you\u2019re interests, there\u2019s probably no better place you could really be, and you should have a fantastic time and your pick of future options if that\u2019s what you decide to do. Socially, Stanford is probably the most friendly and chill place you be if you\u2019re looking at schools like Stanford and Yale. It\u2019s definitely not cutthroat like a lot of peer schools, and most people are really nice, though I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll always find exceptions here or there. Missing admit weekend is nbd. My advise would be to join interesting clubs to find friends with shared interests\u2014it\u2019s a lot more reliable than relying on dorms or orientation when everyone is pretty busy, though a lot of people do make good friends then, too. It really just depends on how you click. Overall though, I\u2019d definitely recommend Stanford over Yale\u2014it\u2019s a fantastic fit for what you\u2019re interested in and you\u2019ll have a lot more to explore. Plus, it\u2019s a really pleasant place to be, and a no-brainer if the west coast is where you want to call home. Congratulations and good luck, whichever you decide! Hopefully we\u2019ll get to see you here!",

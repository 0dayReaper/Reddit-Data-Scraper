Your Stanford experience is what you make of it. \n\nCompetition for research is not terrible and there typically are enough opportunities to go around such that whoever wants research experience can get it. Clubs might be a bit competitive though, since the processes happen early freshman year (and thus are a reflection of high school quality more than anything)\n\nThat being said, just send your application in anyway. Overall acceptance rate is so low that you shouldn't worry about any of this stuff until you get in.",

Toxic and problematic behaviours here err more towards being sycophantic, faking cheerfulness, and being falsely warm rather than being cold, mean, or cutthroat.",

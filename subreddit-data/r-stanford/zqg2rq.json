There is a famous book by K&amp;R on the C programming language that you can find on library genesis or z library and which is definitely worth reading. \n\nFor 107, just be aware that the last 2 assignments are significantly more work than the others (the 2 might be given different names over the years, but essentially it's the binary bomb and heap allocator assignments).\n\nMidterm median was high, final median was low when I took it. \n\nYou'll love the class if you choose to embrace the idea that it is a chance to get better as a new programmer, instead of thinking of the class as a requirement to be tolerated and dealt with.",

I took 103 with Keith and spent a solid 15 hours each week on that class. On the other hand I did my 107 assignments, except for the last 2, in about 3 or so hours each.",

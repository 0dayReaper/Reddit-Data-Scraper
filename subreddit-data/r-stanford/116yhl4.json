            "comment": "How long ago did you apply for reassignment and how many options did you list? Not sure how far down you are but I know someone who thought they were far down the list but got offered a preassignment pretty quickly, at the beginning of spring quarter last year. The beginning of a new quarter could be a natural time when things open up? Probably also depends on what type of assignment you're looking for...some have more interest than others.\n\nHaven't heard that canceling and restarting a new app would speed things up (I would assume opposite?), but ask RDE to be sure.",

If you are willing to wait until the end of the quarter, that's a natural transition point for some people to move.  If nothing turns by then, you can reevaluate reassignment vs a new application.",

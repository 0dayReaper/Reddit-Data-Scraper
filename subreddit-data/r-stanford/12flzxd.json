    "postText": "A friend and I (first-year graduates in fall 2023) have planned to apply for shared accommodation (2b2b or 2b1b) together. Could someone help share their views on the junior two-bedrooms in Escondido Village Mid-Rises and High-Rises?\n\nOK sorry this is actually a repost of an old post, but now the application portal is open so it is more relevant perhaps - again would be really grateful if someone could share their previous experience on these junior 2b1bs! It is just me wondering why these rooms (\\~1000 this year) are a lot cheaper than all other shared 2 bedrooms &gt;1400...\n\nMany thanks in advance! All suggestions and opinions are welcomed.",

            "comment": "These are older buildings, however Blackwelder was just renovated and Quillen will be next year, so one reason is that they're older, but the renovations should fix that.\n\nOTHER reasons why these are cheaper---the high rise units were 1 bedrooms back in the day, and then the living room got converted to a 2nd bedroom.  So look at the layouts and note there is NO common living space.  You basically get a bedroom and a small kitchen to access, and a shared bathroom. XL twin beds. Total square footage = 460 SF,  shared between two people, which is pretty small for a 2BR apt.\n\nCompare that to a Jr 2 BR in EVGR which is 665 SF and each bedroom has it's own nice bath.  Or 2 BR premium in EVGR which is 876 SF, with living room, and each BR has own bath.  Both of these have full XL beds vs twin XL in Escondido High or Mid rise.\n\nBasically you give up space, a living room, and your own bathroom compared to some more expensive options, but the \"dated\" factor should hopefully be addressed with renovations.",

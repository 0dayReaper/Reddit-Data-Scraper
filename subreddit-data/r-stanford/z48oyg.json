            "comment": "My loan is through SFCU, but I bought my car from CarMax so it was pretty simple. I actually didn\u2019t have the SFCU loan ready at the time of purchase so I initially had a loan through CarMax financing, but I was able to get the SFCU loan processed pretty quickly within a few days and then they just essentially bought out the loan from the first financing.\n\nI don\u2019t know how things would work if you\u2019re doing a private purchase, but if you\u2019re going through a dealer it should be straightforward. It was so easy for me that I don\u2019t even remember any of the details really. The SFCU people are very easy to work with, I would just talk to them ahead of time and ask for guidance.",

            "comment": "I got a new car through a dealer with SFCU - I applied online, got pre-approved for an amount (that was the highest limit I knew I could spend). Brought that email and a down payment to a dealer. They tried to beat the rate but couldn\u2019t - I had to forward them the pre-approval info. Most dealers (used and new) in the area have worked with SFCU before so they can do it directly. Apply online and you\u2019ll have the info pretty quick! My loan officer was very helpful and quick to respond",

I saw this in the Stanford Bulletin for the MS in Applied Physics ([https://bulletin.stanford.edu/programs/APLPH-MS](https://bulletin.stanford.edu/programs/APLPH-MS)). Does this mean that there are exams only at the end/during the individual, specific classes, or that grades are only given through assignments, participation and stuff like that?\n\nSorry for the newbie question! Please help, highly confused student here",

We do examinations at the end of each 10-week term, unlike the EU, which often has exams only at the end of the academic year.",

There are some modest 'placement' exams for undergraduates, but none for graduate students here AFAIK for most departments.",

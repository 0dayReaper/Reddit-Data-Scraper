I will say the \"main events\" are really just all-campus frat parties that usually aren't that great tbh. Other stuff is really just up to you: chill kickbacks with friends, formals, friends of the house parties. \n\nAdmin has definitely cracked down more on frats - even compared to last year, I feel like there's noticeably less social activity this year and it's harder for parties to get approved. Palo Alto as a college town kinda sucks tbh, but SF is pretty convenient to get to. I definitely feel like the majority of the student body is somewhat dissatisfied with how administration has handled social life though.",

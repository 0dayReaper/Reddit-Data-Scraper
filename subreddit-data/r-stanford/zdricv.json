    "postText": "Hi, \n\nJunior here. I've taken econ 50 and 51 ( taking 51 this quarter ). I struggled with both classes so much. It takes me a long time to make sense of the concepts, and each pset is grueling. Office hours aren't enough time for me to ask questions and get satisfactory answers. I've declared econ as my major, but am I going to suffer the rest of the major? (havent taken econ 102a or 102b yet)",

Just because you're struggling doesn't mean you can't succeed within the major. CTL offers tutoring for Econ 51 [by appointment](https://studentlearning.stanford.edu/tutoring/tutoring-appointments), which you might find helpful. Best of luck on your exam!",

Whenever I read something by an industry economist, they're always saying they wish they had less micro and macro and more stats and forecast confidence modeling. The industry economists who deal with things like auction design seem a tiny minority. Is my lay view inaccurate?",

Not as many people are doing strictly theoretical work, but I don\u2019t think that necessarily means we should reduce our teaching of it. Half of the importance of it is to teach you how to \u201cthink like an economist\u201d, which carries over when you\u2019re putting together quantitative models and analyses.",

If the guy is struggling with Econ 50 and 51, then most likely he does not fully understand what are the quantitative foundations of undergrad econ. his skillset would then be limited in upper division courses. A good tutor can unlock the mysteries that are likely plaguing him.\n\nIntermediate micro and macro are not difficult courses but they require a clear-headed approach to elementary mathematical modeling of rational actors. It's a leap in abstraction that appears to be Greek to non-econmomists.",

Would hate to see you stick to something you don't enjoy when there are so many interesting classes and majors to take advantage of at Stanford.  If you're excited about Econ, that's different.  You can get tutoring and support at CTL or through the econ dept. Some of the upper level courses are less pset/graph driven and imo more interesting, but having a solid understanding of the fundamentals is still important.",

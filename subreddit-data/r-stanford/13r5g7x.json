    "postText": "Seems like everyone these days is extremely pro grad student unionization. Unionization would give us (grad students) a chance to negotiate a higher stipend, better health insurance, more time off, and all sorts of social benefits.\n\nBut I don't hear anyone talking about how voting to unionize would mean grad students would have to pay dues which would at minimum be 1.44% of salary and likely higher. This means at least $750 a year would be out the door. And there is no way for an individual to \"opt out\" of the union once it is voted in, since California is not a right to work state.\n\nAs PhD students at Stanford, we already get a stipend in excess of $50k (which is much better than similar schools (e.g. UC Berkely)), subsidized housing, and free health insurance. How much more will a unionization really get us? I don't think the marginal chance of the university graciously giving us a massive cost of living increase is that great to offset the union dues. And if it does happen, then it certainly won't come without a fight.\n\nJust wanted to put that out there.",

            "comment": "I think there are a few other points worth considering outside the ones you mentioned. The ones I have in mind are:\n\n* **Mitigating downside risk, even if there isn't as much upside:** Even if a union doesn't immediately translate to higher wages in the short term, they give graduate students power by forming a collective body that can represent our interests. This can mitigate *downside* risk (i.e., mistreatment, or bad policies in response to unforeseen events like a pandemic).\n* **Non-monetary benefits:** Collective bargaining can increase graduate student quality of life outside of immediate financial or social benefits. For example, it gives us more representation around grievance procedures or training.\n* **Paying $750/year may not be \"worth it\" for me, but can significantly improve the lives for my peers and colleagues:** Part of the philosophy of a union is to, well, be united. So even if I don't personally reap the immediate benefits of $750/year, I do believe that I have graduate peers/friends who may benefit. Frankly, I'm pretty fortunate and also pretty strong at self-advocating, but I recognize that many may not be. This is a personal value of mine and I won't try to convince others, but I personally think it's important to be in solidarity with other members of our graduate community, some of whom may have less of a voice than others. A union would be a greater net increase for them than for me, and that would worth the fee I pay.",

            "comment": "This is a common misunderstanding with unions, and one of the many reasons places like Amazon can get away with exploitative labor practices. They will always negotiate a salary that is higher than their cost. Why? Because they have an incentive to impress you. The lawyers on a union serve at the behest of an elected committee of grad students. These grad students are people we know and talk too; they have an interest in not pissing us off (and therefore their hired lawyers have same said incentive). It is always better to be in control, and they have more input than just salary increases",

The latter is only probably marginally better. I\u2019ve seen grad students who can\u2019t even manage the social and professional relationships with their PI or lab group, let alone for an entire student body against a university and their lawyers. I realize I didn\u2019t provide a solution but just commenting on why I don\u2019t have a lot of faith in an elected body.",

We\u2019re not all paid equally, which is one of many reasons why I\u2019m supporting unionization. Second, we wouldn\u2019t pay dues until a contract is agreed upon, and the union won\u2019t support a contract with pay that doesn\u2019t include the cost of our dues. \n\nSo, maybe consider some of those factors as well!",

It\u2019s not clear on the union website what shit could hit the fan. Can something like health insurance no longer be free (several thousands of dollars right there) etc.? What else can be taken away? How petty can the university be?",

            "comment": "The standard 'no questions asked' rule for a grad leave of absence is one year. But as with most 'rules' at Stanford, students can petition for exceptions. You would have to make a strong case, with a lot of detail, to be given a longer leave but if you have strong faculty support, it will likely be approved. \n\nThat said, you should consider your options seriously. Not knowing your situation, I can only speak in generalities. An overly-long time to get a PhD is frowned upon by most places looking to hire. If you were to take more than two years --absent something really impressive like 'went to NASA to be an astronaut' or 'worked in the State department for three years' -- it might mean that the program is not a good fit.  If it is a more personal matter -- mental health, caring for a loved one, divorce etc -- then you might consider taking the standard one-year LOA and while away ask yourself tougher questions about returning. You MAY be better off applying elsewhere and beginning anew -- depending on how far you've gone in your current program. \n\nThere definitely is a 'shelf life' to most PhD programs and the shorter time between the beginning of coursework and the completed dissertation, the more appealing to employers, esp those at other colleges and universities. Good luck.",

Early on I got almost all A\u2019s, but by the time I was about to graduate, my last quarter, I had to change everything to S and even withdrew from 2 classes because I would\u2019ve failed out of them. It sucks in the moment, but in the end I felt pretty good about it because I knew that I had tried my best and pushed myself to my limit, even had the grades to prove it lol. By the end of it I was ready to leave because I felt like I had gotten everything I wanted out of Stanford, and also given it everything I got. Just my 2c, you\u2019ll be ok, you tried your best and that\u2019s something you should feel proud of",

            "comment": "Another grad student here. You didn't mention whether you feel lonely because you're lacking in friends/social connections, or whether it's because you have friends but still feel alienated or separated from them.\n\nIf it's the former reason, and you're looking to make friends in a low-cost, high-quality way, maybe consider going to events hosted by the Stanford Graduate Student Planning Board (GSPB). You can subscribe to their mailing list here: [website](https://glo.stanford.edu/glo-programs/graduate-student-programming-board). They send out weekly emails with events planned by grad students for grad students. If the event involves spending money, the GSPB gets a budget to subsidize some of the cost.\n\nI've gone hiking through a GSPB event and met some cool PhD and MS students who were also there to socialize.\n\nHowever, if it's the latter reason (i.e., you have friends yet still feel lonely), I'm afraid I'd have to learn more about your situation in order to offer any suggestions.",

It took me a while to realize that grad school requires considerable effort on the social front, and I need to care about it as much as I do for everything else (which isn't simple, but still good to keep in mind). Hang in there, I hope it gets better for you.",

Since I am gay, I do this via dating apps. I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s bumble for friends for heterosexual people? Not sure if anyone uses it. Social clubs can work, too, but I find it difficult to break into groups, especially if they\u2019re already established.",

Finding the perfect balance of having a social life, sleep, and good grades is tough. I think Racl's comment is a very good place to start.   \n\n\nOtherwise, I just started working at Stanford in November, and want to grab lunch sometime let me know! I'm only 26 and trying to make friends since I moved from Michigan out here for work. So, I'm also feeling lonely \ud83d\ude14",

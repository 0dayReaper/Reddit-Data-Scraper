Many of us then thought that it was clever virtue signaling. How many kids with that background even apply much less get in. \n\nToday, I would argue that the numbers are even smaller as a % of the applicant pool and the odds even longer for those under $100k. \n\nBack in my day, the rarely met anyone with lower parental income or assets than I had. I did however encounter many sons and daughters of industry whose clever packaging made them eligible for the same loans and grants as I had. So I am rather skeptical. \n\nA public accounting would be a feather in Stanford\u2019s cap. Excluding scholarship athletes and those with massive outside scholarships, what are the stats going back 10+ years. \n\nColumns:\nA: year\nB: income threshold for full ride\nC: number of applicants whose parental income was at or below B\nD: number of acceptances\nE: number who matriculated.\nF-I: same but for the partial grant band.\n\nIf there is a wealth component, then graph E vs time along with the number of matriculated students at or above median wealth and then juxtapose both on a histogram of median wealth of matriculated student. \n\nStanford will either look fantastic or not.",

The second two focus mostly on anecdotal examples, which can be reversed in terms of races (such as the Duke lacrosse case).  And none of these show that most false rape accusations against men of color are made by white women.  They just claim that such accusations were more easily believed compared to cases where the race of the accuser or victim, or both,  are different.  That's a very different thing.\n\nIn the past, the accusations were often made to hide/deny a relationship with a black man, or they were just made up as a reason for harming a targeted black man.\n\nNowadays, especially in a place like Stanford where the vast majority of people don't bat an eye about an interracial relationship, the reason for the false accusation is likely to be very different.  Oh, and when you read the article, it turns out that it is:\n\n&gt; An investigative summary accompanying the criminal complaint filed Tuesday indicates that Gries felt romantically spurned by a co-worker\n\nIn other words, she had the hots for him and he turned her down, so as revenge, she made a false rape accusation.  And the police didn't buy it.  And the university fired her psycho ass (I hope she gets jail time for it).\n\nBut don't let that stop you from portraying this according to your whims.",

There have been only two from rape convictions in the last 12 years. That\u2019s because DNA testing is now routinely used to determine the identity of rapists before trial. This technology has prevented convictions of hundreds or thousands of innocent rape suspects, mostly Black men who were accused of raping white women.\"\n\n[https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Race%20Report%20Preview.pdf](https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Race%20Report%20Preview.pdf)\n\n[https://innocenceproject.org/emmett-till-birthday-pervis-payne-innocent-black-men-slavery-racism/](https://innocenceproject.org/emmett-till-birthday-pervis-payne-innocent-black-men-slavery-racism/)\n\n\"Inequity in application of the law. Research shows that laws and procedural mechanisms applied in cases involving African American men accused of raping white women *void the presumption of innocence or apply a different standard* of the law than in the case of a white man accused of raping an African American woman.\"\n\n[https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/committees/diversity-inclusion/articles/2019/summer2019-intersection-of-race-and-rape/](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/committees/diversity-inclusion/articles/2019/summer2019-intersection-of-race-and-rape/)\n\n\"Garrett (2011) noted that many of the cases in which Blacks were exonerated for rape and murder involved cross-racial identification, most of which were White women who misidentified Black men. Gross et al. (2017) further noted that many innocent Black defendants who were exonerated for sexual assault had been convicted of assaulting White women. \"\n\n[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bsl.2587?af=R](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bsl.2587?af=R)\n\n\"The Race and Wrongful Convictions report released on Tuesday also identifies some striking trends in the data about false convictions, including that pre-trial DNA testing has prevented the conviction of hundreds, maybe thousands, of innocent rape suspects, mostly Black men accused of raping white women.\"[https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/rising-number-false-convictions-shows-stark-racial-patterns-2022-09-27/](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/rising-number-false-convictions-shows-stark-racial-patterns-2022-09-27/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is what I could come up with in, what, the 5 to 10 minutes since my last comment? You certainly took more time on your comment on this Reddit post.\n\nSo once again, let me be direct and clear. You are not going to manipulate me. You are not uneducated or have information unavailable to you. You are willfully using manipulative, gaslighting tactics to act like racism doesn't exist, so you can uphold the myth of white supremacy.",

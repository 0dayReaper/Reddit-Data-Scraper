            "comment": "plenty of people finish econ and go on to work at start-ups in various roles, and combining econ with CS would surely let you build enough skills to go into tech, if that's something you're interested in. on a more general note, there are tons of things you can do with an econ degree! if you want to talk to alums who are currently in the workforce, I'd strongly recommend taking a look on [Stanford Alumni Mentoring](https://mentoring.stanford.edu/hub/stanford-alumni-mentoring-sam/home-v3). you can search specifically for folks who graduated with econ degrees, and they're more than happy to chat with you about what it's like working in their respective fields. if you want to talk more with current students, the econ department has a [peer advisor program](https://economics.stanford.edu/undergraduate/peer-advising). the first three profiles listed are the currently active advisors (the website isn't quite up-to-date, but the email addresses are accurate), so you can always reach out to them to chat.",

I like the linguistic, philosophy and psychology classes that are a part of it that are essentially missing in the cs core. Do you think one would be more limiting than the other? I have seen many symsys majors enter tech roles, especially PM which I am interested in, but I am not entirely sure cause I'm just a freshman lol.",

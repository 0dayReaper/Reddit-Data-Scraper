Hopefully she's doing okay; I can't really imagine doing school during a pandemic with both parents under arrest, even without the media coverage she must be getting.",

Of course she grew up with the feeling that her father is in danger all the time. But until now he returned home after his arrest sooner or later. Now nobody knows exactly when Alexej will be released, it is up to many obstacles and especially it is up to Putin\\`s \"mercy\".",

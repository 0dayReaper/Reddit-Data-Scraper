    "postText": "Basically, I have a bit of an odd academic background that involved starting an integrated Masters in Engineering Program when I was 18 that I got a high 2:1 in and I took a year out during it to work in a spin out company from my university in the UK (not my own company to be clear, one that was well established already by someone else). \n\nI then decided to go and do what in the US is a normal career path but a weird one in the UK and Ireland and go back after doing my MEng and do Medicine (which is an undergraduate degree here that grants an MB, BCh, BAO degree) in Ireland. My first year wasn't as great GPA wise as it could have been, haven't got this years grades but regardless, our grades only count to our final degree classification from next year and final year (the two clinical years).\n\nSo I suppose long story short, I would love to do a Phd in Stanford to be able to bring the two fields I've studied together and given Stanfords history of innovation etc, it seems like the perfect option. \n\nOnly problems are, I'm a little concerned that A. They might focus on the less than perfect degree classification from the MEng and B. That my early GPA in the medical degree, even if I end with a 1:1 might be a problem. So basically I'm wondering if I can get any School of Med Phd's thoughts on my situation's likelihood of success or would I be better giving it a few years of clinical experience in Ireland then applying? \n\nAlso as a follow up, I had at one point also been offered a Phd position at a uni in the UK but had to turn it down as the salary was so bad it wouldn't even cover the minimal cost of rent + insurance on my car + petrol, so I kinda have a concern that the salary could be a problem given I can't seem to find it listed anywhere on the actual Stanford website. Is it ok enough to live on? \n\nThanks for any responses :)",

Try to figure out how to write a good research statement about bringing together those two fields, and drop some prof names that you think will help you do it. I can't speak about medicine, but salary for stem PhDs is about 52k/year. Enough to live on imo.",

That seems like a reasonable amount, is that an untaxed stipend or a before tax salary? (P.S. Thank you for replying, it's a lot easier finding this info out from those in the know than trawling through uni websites!!!) Also, random question but in the Stanford Phd programs, how much freedom is there to choose your own work? Like my previous uni's programs from chatting to the TA's seemed to be tied to them completing one core piece of research, but they could do work (and were expected to) on other unrelated things around that, is Stanford the same?",

In my experience it mostly comes down to writing about your academic background, research interests, and why you want to do your PhD specifically at Stanford (i.e. talking about names of professors and why their research interests you). I\u2019m sure there is room to discuss some research projects you are thinking, if you have a good sense of the field. Stipend is sadly taxed :( I think there is a lot of freedom here to choose what lab you work in, but often the projects are tied to the professors interests and funding sources. That being said, you definitely have input on the direction of the work, and I even know of some people who started their own research projects.",

Very big of you...\n\nLet's forget for a second that you're commenting on a completely unrelated post on a completely unrelated subreddit about something from days ago. I am asking for advice on my future career here. To get an accurate picture of how things could pan out, those who are answering need information.\n\nI have worked hard to save enough money and earn a sufficiently high level of education to be able to get into and pay for the degree I currently studying. I am not ashamed of that and frankly again, it is bizarre that a week later you are commenting here, on this sub, about this topic. It simply adds to the already excessive reaction that included xenophobic comments blaming foreign students for the lack of housing and claims of a superior right to a \"campus experience\" over the right to education that have been called out before.\n\nThis is all also unrelated to the fact that UCD needs to prioritise those who live far enough away from the University that they cannot commute for on campus accommodation over those who can commute to ensure equal access to education.\n\nAnd for the record, proclaiming you deserve to take on campus housing you don't need to attend college from a student who does need it to be able to attend, and then following it up by stalking someone's account a week later and blocking them after trying to \"own\" them really doesn't reflect well man. I'd seriously consider taking the current protest on this site as a period to take a break and reflect.",

            "comment": "I was CEE at Berkeley undergrad and MS Stanford. I prefer Berkeley - more to do, large community, more activities on-campus and off-campus, closer or more convenient proximity to Oakland/SF. Stanford is very quiet, and the social life is more limited. The classes in my opinion are more hit or miss than at Berkeley. They are faster because it's the quarter system. The main benefit of Stanford, in my opinion, is that the program is 1 year and 2 quarters, instead of 1 year, so you have a longer time to experience Stanford. If you are okay living in the suburbs/middle of nowhere, Stanford is fine, and it's even more fine if you have a car, but I think Berkeley has more benefits. They also have more clubs/teams for getting involved with environmental engineering, and it's pretty difficult to get research positions at Stanford because they have been promised to PhD students. There are very few TA positions because there are very few CEE or related major undergrads taking the class, and if your first quarter class has 100 students, there are probably a few gunning for the TAship the next year the class is offered.",

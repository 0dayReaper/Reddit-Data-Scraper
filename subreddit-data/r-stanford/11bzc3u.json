    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a upcoming graduate at Berkeley and I\u2019m starting a full time job in August in the Bay Area. I don\u2019t know what my future career goals are yet, so I still want to try and explore as much as I can. I was wondering if there were opportunities for people like me who didn\u2019t go to stanford but wants to get involved? I heard things like citizen science projects.\n\nthank you for the insight!",

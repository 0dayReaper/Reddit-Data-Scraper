(Stats 200 and CS229)\n\nThere are other classes that get more theoretical, but I think doing something like Stats 116 first can be valuable. Ask about the profs though, that'll probably be the biggest factor determining what the course experience is like.",

            "comment": "Stats 116 is not offered in the Winter, whereas Math 151 is only taught in the Winter.   The content of Stats 116 is the conventional intro probability course as taught as many universities -- note that statistics is a separate subject from probability (the former being focused on issues such as estimation of parameters in probabilistic models, based on measurements from data), and it is conventional to first take an intro probability course and then an intro statistics course to get a solid foundational understanding for both.   Math 151 is a proof-based version of Stats 116.\n\nThe main difference between CS 109 and the route of (Stats 116 or Math 151) followed by Stats 200 is that  CS 109 aims to fit into a single quarter an introduction to \\*both\\* probability and statistics, and to fit in even more (discussion of some intro ML).  But there is no magic bullet to get the depth of coverage of the usual 2-course path in a single quarter. So it is thereby to be expected (and the case in practice) that CS 109 can't cover things in the level of depth that the 2-course path covers.\n\nThe aim of CS 109 is different: to provide a basic exposure in probability and statistics to \\*all\\* CS majors, many of whom have goals different from yours (e.g., not going into AI/ML/DL).  Given your goal of a \"strong understanding\"  which may include a desire for preparedness for more advanced courses in the Statistics department, the 2-course route (which is how this material is learned conventionally anyway) seems better-suited to it.  Talking with profs in the Statistics department should be helpful.",

Problem is, I wanted to take CS 161 (which has a CS 109 prerequisite) in the spring and didn't want to delay it further (also heard it's taught by a good teacher then).\n\nDo you think I could take MATH 151 without Math 115? Math 115 doesn't seem to include anything new (not taught in 51) based on the course description.",

If I could go back I would've done Stats 116 or Math 115 + Math 151. But I know people who learned a lot in 109 so maybe I'm just dumb/couldn't grasp the deeper concepts in a more applied context.",

I took 109 back in 2017 and my ML stuff \u201819-\u201821. Maybe stuff has changed since I\u2019ve left, but hopefully my personal journey may be of some use :) I wanted enough probability to fully understand existing ML/DL and use it in a standard engineering environment for applications, which 109 sufficed for; if I were trying to do research in academia for novel NLP models, doing a PhD, or something along those lines, I\u2019d probably recommend taking more advanced probability classes as other answers mention. All depends on your target I suppose",

Welcome events and Open Houses for students and families, including our Opening Convocation Ceremony, will be held on these days. Plan to say your goodbyes before dinner on September 20, so that students can join their dormmates for their first dinner and house meeting together.\"\n\nYou could stay later if you wanted to do your own thing, but your kid will be busy and focused on making friends.",

First off, congrats and welcome!\n\nMy memories of orientation were that there were heaps of mandatory events for us students to go to, as well as a lot of optional but interesting events. Even if parents stick around, it might be hard for them to have much contact with their children during orientation because of this (and also the fact that the everyone is trying to make friends, and having parents around can make socialising a little awkward). I think if you want to stay for the weekend, it should not solely be for the purpose of supporting/monitoring/looking after your child. If you're a parent and want to stay close by the school for that orientation period in case something happens, but don't want to \"hover\", then there are plenty of nice shops and restaurants that are nearby. SF could also be worth a visit - it's not that far and has plenty of things to explore.",

The reason I'm asking about my daughter is that she has a health issue and we live on the other side of the world, and since I will accompany her to Stanford it would be a good idea to  meet up with health professionals and come up with a treatment plan while I'm there. Not sure if there would be time for that though, given how packed the schedule usually is (they haven't released the details yet)",

There were still some COVID protocols in place so your mileage may differ, but my sense is they want you at Convocation then lunch and a few hours to walk around and say goodbye, and then parents are to leave at let the kids start their college experience.",

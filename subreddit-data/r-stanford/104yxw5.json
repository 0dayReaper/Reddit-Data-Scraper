Am I screwed for ENGR40M? I want to take the class to see whether I am interested in EE or not. I also have not taken CS106B, but just finished 106A. I\u2019m taking it with math 21 and pwr 1, but nothing else even remotely \u201dsubstantial\u201d.",

            "comment": "To be honest, I think you\u2019d get a lot more out of the class with more physics exposure and more experience coding.\n\nTake 106B and the physics series (41 &amp; 43), then take E40M. It\u2019s a lot of fun projects and you\u2019d have more fun if this is your second exposure. Additionally, you\u2019ll end up coding in C so the 106B exposure allows this to understand the syntax of 106B, while also giving you maturity in coding. Taking physics gives you a better intuition of how to deal with your equations (especially 43 since it\u2019s E&amp;M).",

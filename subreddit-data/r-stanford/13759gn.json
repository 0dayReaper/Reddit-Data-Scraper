    "postText": "Coterming next year in a department that doesn't guarantee CAships/RAships and I was wondering how I should go about finding a position. I hope to get a 50% one (20 hrs/wk that pays for 10 units) and am looking to start the search ASAP. When should I begin? How should I begin? What are my odds of getting such a position? What are the odds of getting a position with a lower time commitment?",

            "comment": "It varies department by department so hard to answer with specifics. Some departments only appoint their own PhD students.  For CS there\u2019s a matching process so you rank classes you want to CA and the profs rank you. So you don\u2019t necessarily need to be in contact with profs to get a position. \n\nIn general, I would pick a class you got an A in, or a prof you are doing research with and ask them a few weeks before the quarter.",

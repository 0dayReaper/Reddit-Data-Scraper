    "postText": "I am in the Stanford Center for Professional Development program, in a technical Graduate Certificate program. I already have a Masters' at another Top 10 school, so I don't think I need another, just want Stanford's rigor in a particular discipline.  \n\n\nI'm passing, so far cost about $20K, at the end will cost about $30K total. I had to get accepted into SCPD, but being NDO, not at the same level as a regular Masters (though the beauty of my program is that I could use it for graduate credit, all the work I am doing is graded in the same pool of the matriculated students, I can fail out, and it's required we keep above a 3.0 GPA). I am considered a student, got a Stanford email and everything.  \n\n\nSo - is it posing or disingenuous to wear a \"student\"-aesthetic Stanford shirt? You know, the ones with block letters, may or may not have the Cardinal, simple design, no other logos like the Nike Swoosh?  I can't come to grips with this - I'm non degree option, but going through same hurdles, had to get accepted, BUT, not at quite the same level as a normal student. Wearing sports gear of a school is one thing, I always feel wearing the \"student\" (there may be a name for them, I don't know) shirt is special.",

You get student privileges, are able to do everything online, can even get RA funding if you're so inclined. Seems to maintain all the perks you allude to with the cert. Even if you don't want to finish the MS and are purely taking the courses for the heck of it, the affiliation has its perks.",

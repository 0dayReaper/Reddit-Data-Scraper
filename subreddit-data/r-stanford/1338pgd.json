They are one of the only departments at Stanford known for not inflating grades/sometimes even deflating grades. I don't think it's impossible to do well with them, their classes are just very tough to get an \"A\" in. For example, one of my best friends is premed and had to take the first 5 chem classes (one a quarter) and she struggled to get her \"A-\" every quarter, and she would outperform the midterm exams usually by a standard deviation above median. I haven't actually personally met a chem major, but I've met a lot of people that switched from chem to adjacent fields like bio/humbio/mat sci/engineering and they don't seem to have minded the switch too much.   \n\n\nHope this helps! Grades aren't everything and I wouldn't let that be your only reason for not attending Stanford, but it's totally valid if it's your main!   \n\n\nGood luck! :)",

The Chemistry department as a whole is notoriously awful because it has to service so many students that are not chemistry majors (pre-meds) and so they purposely try to make courses difficult in an attempt to \u201cweed out\u201d people. However, if you make it past the organic chemistry series (133,135), you\u2019ll be in small class sizes with only chemistry or chemical engineering majors and things get better. Lecturers are the best teachers in the department. Chemistry grad student TAs are brilliant so I highly recommend going to office hours.",

If you  want to actually be a chemist, Stanford is probably in the top 5.\n\nMy experience as a TA for graduate student classes was that the quality of undergraduate Chem BS drops off really fast from the top 7 or so schools. Chem undergrads from places like Northwestern, Vanderbilt, UCLA, UMich, UT, Cornell were way way way behind folks from Stanford/Caltech/MIT.  \n\n I have some smart friends from those places, but they were never exposed to rigorous group theory, solving the time-dependant Schr\u00f6dinger equation, or mathematical treatments of statistical thermodynamics as undergrads.\n\nChemE, and engineering in general, seems to have a wider distribution of equivalent curricula. One could even argue Stanford is not the best choice for ChemE if you're interested in things like petrochemical or nuclear.",

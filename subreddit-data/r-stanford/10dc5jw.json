I will say that my experiences have been overwhelmingly positive - the classes have the unique combination of being world class and intimately small, and students uniformly respect humanistic discourse. The only real downside I have experienced is a lacklustre club culture outside of preprofessional orgs - but even this can be circumvented if you know where to look. History majors are certainly in the minority but there are many, many polisci/ir people.",

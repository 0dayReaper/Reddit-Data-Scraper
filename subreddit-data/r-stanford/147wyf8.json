Do students still get the chance to learn deeply and reflect into the classes they're taking, or is it just cramming for exams constantly?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm an incoming freshman unsure about how I'll adapt to/like the quarter system, and any advice on it would be appreciated!

Time management skills are critical if you are taking a heavy load of units.\n\nYou have more time to digest material doing semesters, but those classes drag on forever.\n\nPick your poison.",

However sometimes you might find the exact same class at cal for example, and if you compare curriculum, you might find that Stanford will pack in 16 weeks of material into 10 OR just cut some topics. \n\nGenerally for courses that offer a year long sequence, theres not much difference.",

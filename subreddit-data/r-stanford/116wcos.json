    "postText": "I scored a fair amount below the mean for both my 51 and 106B midterm. I want to blame the fact that my approach to classes/general time management/motivation is all over the place and that I always study a day or two before, but I\u2019m starting to think I\u2019m just dumb. I only have my roommate who basically does the same thing to compare to. He took the classes last quarter and said they weren\u2019t bad at all. He must be a genius or I\u2019m really just dumb. Either way it makes me feel bad about myself. \n\nFrom speaking to a lot of people I understand that GPA doesn\u2019t really matter but how am I suppose to be a quant trader, SWE, or do anything in a challenging technical field when I can\u2019t even do well in intro level classes? Sure GPA may not matter but proficiency with the material does and that\u2019s not being reflected in my scores.",

Just look up people\u2019s parents and see if they come up as blue links on Wikipedia if you feel bad. Just remember to work hard and keep your head up, you will do fine in upper level classes and you are smart enough to do whatever you are passionate about. -junior",

In fact physics education research at Stanford has demonstrated the single most important metric for performance on intro physics finals is previous exposure to physics. This doesn\u2019t bode well for the teaching of these classes but also demonstrates just how biased grades in intro stem courses are. Please please don\u2019t give up. I was in your shoes and thought I was too stupid to study STEM but you\u2019re not measured by your background. Use all of Stanford\u2019s resources to your benefit and don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you can\u2019t do it. All the best!",

It isn\u2019t really significant that your roommate is able to prepare for the midterm in less time than you are. Hard work counts for a lot more than raw ability in any field. Once you learn how to prepare properly for the exams and do well on the problem sets, you will be able to earn good grades, and nobody will ever ask how long you had to study to earn those grades.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s good that you\u2019ve recognized that you have some time management and studying issues. Now you can go about fixing those problems.\n\nThird, it sounds like you caught this early. You\u2019ve got lots of time to turn it around, and you\u2019re obviously self-aware enough to do so successfully.\n\nFourth, consider whether this is really the right field for you. I started in chemical engineering and chemistry. I had the ability to earn As, although rarely pulled it together enough to consistently do so. And that should have been a signal to me early on that I ought to have chosen a different course of study that I\u2019d be more successful in. Two of my really good friends were the same way\u2014either average or way below average in our Stanford undergrad studies. All three of us would be considered to have really excellent jobs today\u2014although obviously not in our undergrad majors. Be flexible and choose a path that you\u2019ll be maximally successful in and that you love. There are tons of things you can study at Stanford, and no limit to what you can do after Stanford (even if you studied the \u201cwrong\u201d thing)",

IDK sorry I'm not indoctrinated into this Stanford culture yet where we pretend reality doesn't exist for this farce of politeness.\n\nNothing polite about ruining students' confidence, nor this toxic hustle culture like it's normal that that man gives a lot more work than is at all appropriate for a 5 unit class. You can't even finish those assignments in 15 hours, not a chance. Class alone is 4 hours. Gosh, it'd sure be nice to have time to read the textbook and do some coding practice on the side to get my muscle memory going. How many hours should I spend? 30? 40? What's appropriate? \n\nThe class is great (low standards by now? why do we need recursion, who cares, lol) for people who can complete the assignments in a reasonable amount of time. If you need extra help, you're fucked. How could you possibly spend any longer on his class than the average person, and keep up with your other classes? Impossible. Gatekeeper. \n\nAre you really normalizing people coming here asking about CS106B and other people telling them not to worry about their grades? Is that normal? I should work my ass off in CS106B for 30 hours a week and just expect to receive a shitty grade because his class is that *unreasonable*? Let's call it what it is. Sick.\n\nMaybe this is how toxic schools go. We let students fail because we need a grade distribution. Okay, but don't come for me when I question if that's education or a competitive game. I came here to be educated. \n\nI don't care if it's Keith, or the university, or the high schools everyone came from who celebrate and normalize this. I don't think it's normal. We're allowed to disagree. Keith should have given a shit the first time people posted on here talking about panic attacks during his midterms. He doesn't. So yes, I judge his character. He'll survive. Has plenty of people like you happy to continue enabling him, at the sacrifice of your fellow student. I promise I'm judged much more harshly with my bad grade, which actually has consequences for my life, unlike this post, which has none on Keith's, depending on how narcissistic that Ego gets.

STEM is hard work and it doesn\u2019t get easier, you just get used to the demands. When I was in undergrad I pulled 50-60 hour weeks to ensure I understood the material and when I graduated and worked my first engineering job I pulled 50-60 hours to get up to speed\u2026 now that I\u2019m in grad school\nI do the same.",

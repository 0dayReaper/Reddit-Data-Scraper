            "comment": "It is interesting that this article points out Dee Mostofi's emphasis that the revising process is still fundamental to Stanford's education:\n\n  \n\"Mostofi said student assignments will continue to be designed to 'support students in developing linked thinking and writing skills,' including the drafting and revising processes, as well as citing sources.\"\n\n  \nAn earlier online Stanford article, \"Stanford faculty weigh in on ChatGPT\u2019s shake-up in education\" (https://acceleratelearning.stanford.edu/story/stanford-faculty-weigh-in-on-chatgpts-shake-up-in-education/) appallingly included the following quote by Stanford's Sarah Levine, assistant professor of education:\n\n  \n\u201cMany students are not yet fluent enough writers to use the process of writing as a way to discover and clarify their ideas. ChatGPT may address that problem by allowing students to read, reflect, and revise many times without the anguish or frustration that such processes often invoke.\u201d\n\n  \nPerhaps there was some blowback to Levine's comment -- as well there should be.",

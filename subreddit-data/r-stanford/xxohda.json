    "postText": "Please don't cheer when our football team is on offense. It distracts the offense and prevents them from functioning. The quarterback needs to yell out to players the play calls and it increases the chances of them making mistakes when it's loud. Instead cheer when our defense is on the field and distract the opposing team's offense.\n\nIt doesn't seem like much but it adds up. It's like writing letters to your senator or voting. It's a football faux pas to cheer when your team is on offense.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nProspective grad student here. Both my partner and I got into our respective grad programs and are starting to think about housing. \n\nMy partner and I are super excited to be living together on campus, but we had some concerns about the couples housing. For personal reasons, we would prefer to live in a 2 bedroom but it seems like the 2Bd options for couples housing is limited. \n\nHas anyone heard of couples applying for single graduate housing as roommates and are we guaranteed to be paired with each other if we request it? Are there any priorities that couples receive in the housing process that we would be missing out on?\n\nWould also appreciate any general thoughts about living as a couple on campus!!!",

            "comment": "There is an option of \u20181bedroom with den\u2019 in Escondido Village low rise if you are both Stanford students, which is effectively a 2br, if I remember correctly. \n\nOther than that, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for couples to apply for 2br as roommates. In theory, the 2br 2 bath in EVGR and EV low rise is open to couples without kids, but it is almost certainly already reserved for couples with kids, and couples without kids will have the lowest priority. \n\nIf you are fine with living off-campus, you can go for the off-campus subsidised housing. They are usually much more spacious, cheaper and less competitive (downside is of course being off-campus). \n\nYou can also try your luck with Munger 1BR which is more spacious than even some of the 2br in other residences. But it\u2019s super competitive - I believe there are only 18 of them. I didn\u2019t get one, even when listing it as 1st choice and with highest priority as new grad students.",

Although there might be a possibility that you are assigned to different housing - and there\u2019s no way to ensure that won\u2019t happen. I\u2019m not sure whether you can switch to couples\u2019 housing if that happens.",

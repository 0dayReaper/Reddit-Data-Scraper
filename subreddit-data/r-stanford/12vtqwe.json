    "postText": "Hey everyone! I stumbled upon with [this](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/) Berkeley student-run computer cluster, and I was wondering if we have something similar at Stanford. I know we have [FarmShare](https://web.stanford.edu/group/farmshare/cgi-bin/wiki/index.php/FarmShare_2) (and Sherlock, of course), which is free to access to all of us, but wondering if there's interest to build something from scratch that's purely student run that's also a space to learn new hardware and computing engineering skills, and also to promote open-source software.   \n\n\nWhere to start if we want to organize something like this? Is someone into this? :-)",

Not sure if that\u2019s along the lines of what you\u2019re looking for? \n\nAs for me personally I would totally love to work on a HPC team, and I\u2019m trying to incorporate some elements of HPC work into the PhD research I proposed to my new PI.",

We do lots of experimentation with hardware, software automation, etc. Plus we have connections to Stanford labs, government agencies, and industry who help fund our work.\n\nPlease reach out to me, I'd love to chat about this!",

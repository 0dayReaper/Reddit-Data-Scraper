    "postText": "I am a CS-HCI coterm with these four classes left to complete the degree:\nCS 111, 161, 103, 142\nI plan to take 2 classes during the winter and spring quarters. I\u2019ll be taking 111 next quarter, and I have friends taking 161 too so I am thinking of taking that as well. I heard that both classes are a lot of work so wondering if I shouldn\u2019t take them together. On the other hand, I\u2019m only taking two classes, and it would be nice to take 161 with friends so maybe it\u2019d just be better to take those classes now together even if is challenging. \nStill, wondering if it\u2019d be better to take one of the other classes along with 111 instead of 161, so I\u2019d appreciate any insight!\nHow much time did you spend in these classes if you took them?\n\nBTW\nFor context I\u2019m not a strong programmer and will go into PMing.",

Mary is an excellent instructor and the class is much easier (both difficulty and workload-wise) in the spring than in the winter. \n\nFor 111 take it in the winter. John taught it last spring and the exams was pretty brutal. The instructor Nick revamped the class in the fall so it\u2019s much easier.",

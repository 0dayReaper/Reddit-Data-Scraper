            "comment": "Yes, PHIL 150 covers quite a bit that is not covered in CS 103. I would not recommend taking PHIL 151 without 150 if your only relevant background is CS 103 (and would not recommend taking PHIL 152 without 151). It's doable, because IIRC PHIL 151 basically goes over the relevant parts of 150 again, but much faster and in more depth (they are definitely assuming you took PHIL 150, and most students will have taken PHIL 150 right before 151).\n\n(I took all 4 of these courses, as well as CS 157)\n\nEdit: you can find the course reader for PHIL 150 at [this link](https://www.coursehero.com/file/53192242/150-Readerpdf/) (FWIW I took it in 2019 and this seems to be the version we used then, so it's probably not *that* outdated). I think you could plausibly self-study it over break and be ready for PHIL 151 next quarter.",

If you just go through the motions of the course, you'll pretty much just be doing a bunch of esoteric and sort of useless math that you're unlikely to encounter again later. But if you are engaging with it thoughtfully, and you're the kind of person who finds this stuff interesting, then it's possible you'll really, *really* love it (I know I did).",

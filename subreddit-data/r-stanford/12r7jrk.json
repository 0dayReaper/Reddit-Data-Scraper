    "postText": "As an international, my F 1 visa prevents me from working off campus. I\u2019m sure there are many international students here but it honestly sounds unrealistic to think that all the international students are just working part time on campus. I know for a fact that many of us are trying our best to avail opportunities and settle here but I just don\u2019t know how to navigate it.\n\nIt seems like it\u2019ll be too much if I wait till I graduate when I know I have the skills and knowledge to start a business or a start-up and on campus jobs just seem to be less efficient in terms of growth.\n\nHow are you guys maintaining your financial well being on your own as an international? Are there any loop holes through which we can avail the same opportunities like the nationals on campus in terms of internships, jobs and businesses?",

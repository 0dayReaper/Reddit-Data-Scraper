I graduated from Stanford last year, with a Bachelor\u2019s in Math, co-terminal Master\u2019s in CS (mostly theory and AI), and a minor in History. At Stanford, I did quite a lot of a cappella. I\u2019m now working as a robotics engineer, still on a student visa. I also TA-ed computer science for almost 2 years, and I\u2019m an alumni interviewer.\n\nEdit: Just adding that I\u2019m still watching this post, so if you show up I\u2019ll still reply!

                    "comment": "Stanford hates fun was born in my final year here. The gist of the message is largely true in my opinion: the administration here have veered away from allowing fun stuff, as they\u2019re increasingly trying to avoid liability. The environment and atmosphere is certainly different from when I was a freshman. Drinking rules are now definitively more strict. They also made some very big mistakes with the residency system in my opinion\u2014it\u2019s much worse than it used to be. And COVID definitely left a culture gap. It\u2019s not good.\n\nBut what that\u2019s ignoring is that it\u2019s *not* that Stanford students hate fun. Stanford students came up with that slogan, to convince the administration here to change. The full version should be something like: \u201cStanford\u2019s admin unreasonably restricts fun that is a potential liability for admin.\u201d And nowadays, most Stanford students still do not hate fun. They want lots of fun stuff to happen. There\u2019s parties, they\u2019re just more restricted than they used to be. There\u2019s drinking, it\u2019s just a little more covered up than it used to be.\n\nAbolish Stanford Greek are sometimes given as an example for \u201cstudents that hate fun.\u201d Personally, I disagree with this characterisation. But you can go check out news on them and make of it what you will. \n\nThe one other major change to social life here since my time is a little app called Fizz, where people anonymously post stuff. Personally: I kinda hate it. Other people think it\u2019s great, as people are honest. But on there you\u2019ll definitely see students want fun and are complaining when the university doesn\u2019t get it right.\n\nI wasn\u2019t super into Greek life (though I went to frat parties a few times before COVID), but I think I had a lot of fun when COVID wasn\u2019t raging. Fountain hopped with friends and beers and speakers and floaties. Ran around campus singing to people on Valentine\u2019s Day. Went to all the events like Nomad and Full Moon on the Quad at least once. Did a picnic in the Quad for our senior dinner when it was cancelled due to COVID. Drove to Twin Peaks late at night and contemplated life. Went to many shows in SF - I actually went to about 36 last year! Had many parties in my rooms or friends\u2019 rooms, with and without lots of alcohol. Went skiing in Tahoe, and rafting in Marin, and hiking everywhere, and to the aquarium in Monterey, and did spring break trips. Played percussion with band. Lots of karaoke and video games with friends. And I still do most this stuff, mostly with Stanford friends\u2026 \n\nHere\u2019s the good news: you can still do all this stuff and more and basically every Stanford student will be so happy to do it with you! Of stuff I mentioned, only FMOTQ is now cancelled, and people still did it informally this year.\n\nBand is a really interesting case, but in short: band is not as fun as it used to be. But a lot of people who were actually in the band (who I know personally) would agree that that was worth it to kill a culture of sexual misconduct, that current students just don\u2019t really know about. Did they go too far in the other direction? Maybe, even probably. But the old version was worse, as a non-trivial percentage of the regular members had their times at Stanford significantly scarred. I don\u2019t know what the compromise should be.",

My friends and I would play smash in the dorm, drink, do the \ud83c\udf43, play board games, rent zip cars to go places, and much more. The Greek life scene never piqued my interest, especially with all the controversy that they have garnered. The Caltrain allows you to go to SF and other places as well for an affordable price. I found out recently you can take a VTA bus to downtown San Jose. There are lots of things to do if you decide to not get involved in Greek life. Student orgs also offer opportunities to make friends and have fun. In my opinion, the students who consider parties at the Greek houses as the pinnacle of student life are the ones that have been most let down. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s so stupid that the university is shutting down parties, but it\u2019s never been of much concern to me. In conclusion, just don\u2019t go have high expectations of Greek life and you won\u2019t be disappointed (I think).",

I\u2019ve been to a few grad parties and they\u2019re generally much more chill than undergrad ones, but everyone is open to chat, especially during Fall when new people are showing up, and events are pretty widely shared among grad students. You can meet all sorts of people at these parties and hangouts, and in graduate housing which is pretty centralised these days. There is a definite humanities/STEM split though.\n\nAnother thing is if you\u2019re interested, many of the undergrad groups are also open to grad students\u2014a little secret of Stanford is much of undergrad a cappella is massively propped up by talented grad students who can stick around forever. Some dance groups and things too.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019d say is if you have a car, bring it, or make best friends with someone with a car. Can make a big difference to your social life. Some grad students like to go up to SF to do stuff, and go hiking, and get out the Stanford bubble, and it\u2019s so much easier to do all that with a car.",

How you make friends will be your story, but here\u2019s mine! :))\n\nI made friends online and at ISO, then we basically never hung out again, but super nice people \ud83d\ude05 Then everyone else in my all-frosh dorm showed up. I had an initial friend group there for the first quarter-ish, which ended up just not being a good fit for me. Then I made another friend group in that dorm, who I really liked, and still like. But I started dating someone in that group, and we broke up over the Summer. That ended up mostly pushing me out that group in my Soph year. I then put a bunch of effort to make better friends with my a cappella group, and started hanging out with them all the time. They\u2019re still most my closest friends, and I met my partner of &gt;4 years though this group. \n\nIn short: it was a windy path, and that\u2019s totally okay. You don\u2019t have to get it right to start with, especially in your frosh year. It\u2019s totally fine to drift around a bit. It took me some active effort in my Soph year. But I promise everyone is really really open to making friends during NSO and frosh fall, and it\u2019s a genuinely great environment to be making friends, even if you\u2019re pretty introverted like me. I genuinely have never felt as positive as I did that quarter about making friends. You can totally just go hang out in random people\u2019s rooms, and it\u2019s like\u2026 cool and normal. Many of the people I met but didn\u2019t really join their \u201cfriend group\u201d are still good friends. I also met some good friends in classes, and while TA-ing! So it\u2019s totally your way. \n\nFor me it was mostly my freshman dorm, and then my a cappella group though. (I suspect most people it\u2019s mostly dorm and groups, if that helps.)",

Otherwise, the distribution of people is not totally different from the outside world here. I think people are really open to making friends at the start and in Freshman year, then again at the start of Soph year, then things are more closed off from there.\n\n-\tI don\u2019t know if I did navigate them! I sort of just showed up to stuff I was interested in and tried to speak to people I was interested in. There are tons of overseas programs I didn\u2019t think about at all, when some of my friends have done like\u2026 four or five of them. Mostly just keeping an eye on what your friends are doing and sharing stuff can be very helpful though.\n\n-\tI\u2019m not sure if I have too many things I wish I\u2019d known that are not just \u201chindsight specific to me\u201d but I wish I\u2019d believed in myself more and started off with harder classes. I wish I\u2019d known to apply to more research earlier. I wish I\u2019d not had a certain shitty relationship in Frosh fall. I wish I\u2019d known to ignore people\u2019s advice, as it tends to be specific to them.",

While it is true that many expected positions are filled, there is always room for someone to work on some kind of project in a research group if they are enthusiastic and talented.  Starting with an idea of the field you want to be in and a reason why you should be in that field is important in terms of being noticed, though.\n\nSometimes it's just a question of having the stars align just right.  Years ago I knocked on a professor's door after doing well in his class, and it turned out they needed someone to write a software version of a paper to verify that it worked correctly, so that's what I did for my sophomore summer.  Just recently I inherited an undergrad who knocked on my PI's door when he happened to be in the mood to add undergrads to the group.  It's all a matter of knowing what you want to do, finding the right people to talk to, and getting a bit lucky with the timing.",

My suggestion would be try to sign up for the CS seminar mailing lists, and go to tons of them and ask (non-obnoxious) questions and talk to people. There are a few mailing lists, and I think most CS grad students could point you to the active ones. cs-seminars@ and theory-seminar@ were my usuals, and I think you can join them at mailman.stanford.edu. Also go to professor\u2019s office hours, and ask questions, including about their research.\n\nMost student clubs will probably not be very active over the Summer, but worth searching for stuff you\u2019re interested in, and signing up for mailing lists or slacks or discords if they exist. I was not super involved in these outside of my research, but some of them are probably pretty cool.\n\nI\u2019d also suggest applying for stuff, including research! Worst that can happen is you get rejected. But you\u2019re right they prefer Stanford UG, sadly.\n\nWhat classes are you planning on taking?",

South Bay from like Menlo Park through Sunnyvale (including Stanford) is basically as expensive as it gets, unless you go to a tourist spot like Santa Cruz, Tahoe, or Carmel. Obviously stuff like hiking and just walking around is free (modulo gas) and that\u2019s a pretty common \u201cthing to do\u201d around here, because there\u2019s lots of nice California nature and things to see\u2026 You can Caltrain to SF for something like $7-8 (round trip is ~$14-16.) VTA buses, MUNI, and BART are reasonably priced public transport, I use them a lot. I\u2019d say I find local hotels and airbnbs prohibitively costly unless I have a large group, so usually do day trips rather than go overnight. Napa trips are expensive for example, so I\u2019d rarely do them. Concert tickets vary in price from $10-20 for a tiny band, to maybe $35-50 (including fees) for a medium band you\u2019ve heard of, to maybe $70-100 for bigger artists. I personally very rarely spend in that top category or higher than that, so will sadly likely never get SZA tickets :\u2019).\n\nI know very little about civic engagement, as I\u2019m a resident alien, so I get very little political say.

Unless you\u2019re really familiar with the school, I gotta say that I suspect this is not the best way to go about writing an application, especially for a Master\u2019s. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re likely to be able to second guess what a particular admissions officer thinks the school needs, and even if you do, it might just come off as an assertion. I\u2019d suggest the more conventional approach, just thinking about what you can add with your existing interests and passions, to existing programs at the school! (I also don\u2019t think you should base your interests off where you want to apply to.)\n\nTaking your question at face value: more excitement would be great right now! In my last couple quarters, that\u2019s slightly what felt missing vs before the pandemic. What are they concerned about at Stanford? I have no idea.\n\nMy opinions on your points are complicated, at best. As an example, claiming \u201cStanford doesn\u2019t do enough for mental health\u201d is popular but actually pretty tricky, and I say that as someone who deeply believes in mental health management, and definitely made the most of Stanford\u2019s CAPS in my freshman year\u2026 It\u2019s not great at Stanford, but also students are privileged to have access to a basically free psychologist that most students don\u2019t use, with much more availability than I have accessible to me as a local alum with decent insurance. There just aren\u2019t enough good, qualified psychologists (and even worse, psychiatrists) for current demand, and that applies to Stanford, but it\u2019s also true of most of California and the nation right now? In fact, think I claim you\u2019d be substantially more effective if you worked to help basically anyone but Stanford students with this. The Stanford students already have lots of people (some excellent, some useless) trying to help them! Many other countries are hugely underserved in terms of psychiatry - or semi-reject it for cultural reasons - so I hesitate to say \u201cStanford needs more mental health services.\u201d \n\nEthics is similarly problematic; there are lots of people at Stanford working on this and who care about this already. Stanford folks probably talk about ethics more than the average college student, especially in the tech context. But it\u2019s hard to fix the underlying issue, and easy to add somewhat meaningless ethics statements to everything. Plus, it turns out a lot of the people who care about \u201cethics\u201d are just focusing in the wrong direction\u2014and I\u2019m not claiming I know what the right direction is, but I can tell you there are enough people pointing in orthogonal directions that some of them have to be wrong.",

It really got me thinking\n\n\nMinor correction: I'll be applying as a transfer for a Bachelors, the end goal is Masters \n\n\nYour words are quite helpful, and actually ring very similarly true for the CA community college I'm at right now. They're desperately trying to get engagement and excitement back, but \"...not the same as before the pandemic\" is a common utterance. I think it's connected to the rumblings about mental health. Without the excitement and social buzz going around, then college is only academia, and grades, and churning out a degree, and stress. I'll be thinking about trying to do something with this... \n\n\nMental health services are available but I haven't used them yet, but I'm honestly thinking about it (for general mh maintenance) because otherwise I have to deal with Veterans Affairs - with 3+ month wait times, if they ever respond to my calls and don't cancel my appts. \n\n\nI work part-time at the Veterans Center at my college at the moment, so I could probably expand that into getting involved in the SVO (student vet organization). I'm TAing for last semester's Accounting teacher now, and I got dragged into a social media project for the Business dept (trying to wrestle it from the old folks' hands). I met with my current college president and asked her what she thinks the school needs...she was very helpful but didn't answer the question, so maybe it's a hard question. Or maybe the whole idea is that everyone should just do what they think is needed. \n\n\nI still don't know how to contribute to the 'conversation' on ethics even if I think I have quite a bit of experience with ethical issues. I was an intel analyst in the military, and experienced a lot of: \"how good people can do bad things: moral relativity over time\", \"how people can make moral decisions without needing to make a moral judgment\", and \"why people with moral blinders can easily climb hierarchies and shit their toxicity everywhere.\" \n\n\nMaybe preparing people for how environments can compromise your personal morals, performing mental rehearsals of moral scenarios and WWYD, defining the boundaries of when you would stop following someone (as opposed to 99% of our effort is trying to define the leadership we want)\n\n\nAnyway, thanks for the thoughts and taking the time to write them out for me. Gave me some good ideas.",

I checked the website but couldnt really find any great benefits, seemed like any other medical insurance to me- covers for basic health issues like cough cold, etc and for emergencies. Any idea why so expensive and any broken benefits it has?",

As far as I know, it\u2019s deliberately very close to the average insurance cost of such a policy in California (which is between $6000 and $7000 annually) hence why most uninsured students just pay for Cardinal Care rather than shopping around. If it were super expensive then no-one would use it. But I do know that it\u2019s pretty normal in terms of generosity when you get hit by a car (like I did\u2026) It also has a few privileges in terms of \u201cless bother with CAPS and Vaden, because they\u2019re super well set-up to take it.\u201d I hear Stanford hospital is pretty good with it too. \n\nIf you can find something that is way cheaper and fits the bill, I\u2019d just use that instead. Just make sure it ticks all the boxes or they\u2019ll make you pay for Cardinal Care anyway!",

I\u2019m starting a Ms this year in a UC. is there a way to start building connections during the Master with a professor in Stanford to increase my chances to get accepted? Like a Summer research internships but for graduate students?  \n\nHow does the TAing process work? How do you get one? \n\nThank you so much :)",

Having said that, I\u2019d generally suggest your best chance is probably to get good letters of rec, rather than have existing connections. Most internships that contribute to PhD admissions will be MS students already admitted to Stanford, and I imagine they take most the bandwidth of professors here.\n\nCS TA-ing has a formal online application process that any grad student can take part in where you write a small application for each class you wish to TA, and order them by your preference. It\u2019s very well-defined and concrete, and happens before each quarter.",

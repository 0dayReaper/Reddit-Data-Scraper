    "postText": "I'm an MS CS Student from a state university. Moved to US after working in multiple countries for 5 years and launching my crypto startup under a YC equivalent incubator in Asia (Failed as it was heavily dependent on Terra).\n\nI haven't landed an internship (maybe because I didn't customize my applications enough) but it's an opportunity for me to work interesting projects and connect with interesting people.\n\nDo you know of any ways I can associate with Stanford to work on projects (maybe with profs or labs) and startups over summer (and beyond if things go well). I know that funding is never an issue at Stanford.\n\nSkills - Web Technologies, AI (4/10) and Product management",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. Very blessed to receive full scholarship to Stanford (with a teaching position as an undergrad). I also got a job (as Director) at small government research facility (NASA). Lastly, I got elected to be president of my country (terms only last 3 years). Any advice for me? I feel like this decision is very important so please list the pros and cons of attending Stanford. Thanks!",

Or do you have to deal with a Prime Minister?\n* If there is a Prime Minister, are you a figurehead President (like in Germany or Israel), a power-sharing arrangement (like in France or Serbia), or is the Prime Minister subordinate to you (like in Ukraine or Egypt)?\n* Does your party control Congress/Parliament?\n* What is the presidential salary?\n* How large is the presidential palace?\n* Is there a presidential pension?  If not, can you get one passed?",

I had a very similar situation when I was trying to decide between Harvard, Stanford (both schools offered me the option of simultaneously serving as university president while working on my undergraduate degree), becoming the youngest US Senator in American history or CEO of Disney. Ultimately, I chose none of the above and have spent the last several years wandering the earth and solving the crimes that have stumped local law enforcement officials. I know it was an unorthodox choice but it absolutely worked out best for me and I wouldn't change a thing.\n\nBest of luck in whatever you choose!",

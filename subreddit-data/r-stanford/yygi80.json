So, how am I supposed to show Stanford that I am in need for the financial aid?\n\nUnfortunately, the only document that I can provide to Stanford is a letter from my father's employer. Will this document suffice? And what should I do if not?\nThank you.",

Wear your big boy/girl pants and call them during business hours: [https://financialaid.stanford.edu/contact/](https://financialaid.stanford.edu/contact/)\n\n  \nEsp if you have extenuating circumstances like the conflict going on now -- this is the time to connect to a human there so they can fast track you out of processes and handle you as a special case with extra benefits, and you want that.",

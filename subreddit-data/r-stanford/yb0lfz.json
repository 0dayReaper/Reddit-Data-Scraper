I was also able to continue getting free student tickets to sporting events. I still had card access to my lab space, as well as access to cloud storage + FarmShare + my email.\n\n\nI was able to keep Cardinal Care when I started my leave of absence during the academic year, but I was not able to enroll in Cardinal Care in the fall at the start of the next academic year.\n\n\nI am pretty sure that you cannot live in on-campus housing or Stanford-subsidized housing if you go on a leave of absence.",

We currently live in PA, where the cost of living is significantly lower, so I guess my questions are:\n- how do grad students afford to live in the Bay Area?\n- do you all live in grad student housing?\n- if not, what neighborhoods are you living in?\n- do you have roommates and if so, how did you go about finding them?",

            "comment": "* how do grad students afford to live in the Bay Area?\n\nI guess the first question is whether they were accepted into a PhD program or a Masters/Professional program (Law, GSB, Med school, etc). PhD programs usually come with a stipend of around 44k/year, at least in Engineering. Masters and Professional programs are typically unfunded.\n\nA follow up question would be whether you work as well, as that will have a big impact on how you can afford to live.\n\nAssuming they are a PhD student, 44k/year is livable out here, but it's a bit tight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* do you all live in grad student housing?\n\nMost grad students do live in Stanford housing. For a while the housing was more scarce than it is now, since a bunch of new graduate housing was just built. I lived in grad housing for 4 years, and I'm off campus for my last year of my program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* if not, what neighborhoods are you living in?\n\nI live in Redwood City. Anything between Mountain View and Redwood City is a reasonable range if driving. If you're not driving, basically just Palo Alto and parts of Menlo Park are within biking range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* do you have roommates and if so, how did you go about finding them?\n\nI do have roommate that I knew personally. For graduate housing they will assign roommates to you if you need them. Normally though for couples housing, you do not have a roommate. Be aware that if you plan to live together, you probably need either couples housing or a studio. Most grad students split a 2 bedroom with another student. I don't think you would qualify for this as a couple.",

I lived on campus for 5 years, now live off campus with my partner. \n\nIt really depends on what you and your partner want, but I would recommend couples housing (not studio - very small) and you can always move off campus after the year is up.",

            "comment": "I think affordability comes down to mindset and place in life. I came right from undergrad so going from paying for school to getting paid ~$48k was great for me vs others coming from industry taking a pay cut. Also I have friends in med school that have to pay to be here so I feel like I can\u2019t complain (I know I am basically cheap labor to the university though). If you aren\u2019t trying to start a family/settle down and also don\u2019t need to support others financially (ie family that can\u2019t work) then I don\u2019t find affordability to be an issue (and I\u2019m not like some super cheap person).\n\nGrad housing is pretty nice and most students just do random roomate assignment. I\u2019ve had 4 random roommates and liked them all. You can always move off campus after first year if you find something you like better.\n\nLastly I think it\u2019s important to mention (IMO) that the decision to come here should also take into consideration plans after grad school. If the plan is to stay in academia then coming here isn\u2019t a huge advantage over others (the PI is more important), but I do think that coming here is a huge door opener for going into industry. The Stanford name carries a ton of weight in industry.\n\nSource: I\u2019m a current grad student that absolutely loves it here",

I'm going to get roasted for this cuz Reddit is a funky demographic, but I don't care. Stanford is mostly a name for networking. Like that's it. If the education program you want isn't that much better than your other options and your eventual life outcome won't be much different, nah. Go live somewhere you can afford to eat. It's soul-crushing to be on a campus that owns 30-billion dollars of assets, and you can barely afford to eat, while you WORK FOR THEM as TAs.

You\u2019re going to hear a lot of undergrads complain about the area being boring, which is why I mention this.

Eventually I found a room in southwest Old Palo Alto where I lived for a grand total of 3 weeks before I ended up getting a spot on campus.

What type of lifestyle do you want? Stanford and the surrounding area are fairly sleepy, although there is always a lot to do on campus, from art exhibitions to music to tons of lectures. If you want a city lifestyle, you will have to commute to it (SF or San Jose) and then there aren't late-night trains, so you'd have to bus or Uber. If you like the suburbs, we have those aplenty. If you want more of a forest or a beach, you can get it, but it'll be a slog of a commute, which I would not recommend for first-year grads.",

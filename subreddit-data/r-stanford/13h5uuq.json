    "postText": "Hi all, I'm a current non-traditional community college student admitted to Stanford as a (likely) junior-year transfer. I\u2019ve had the amazing luck of being admitted to several other incredible schools and am trying to narrow down my choice.\n\nStanford is definitely high on my list, but I\u2019m a bit concerned that its Environmental Systems Engineering (ESE) degree isn\u2019t ABET accredited. Current or former ESE students \u2013 could you provide insights based on your academic experience as a student or on your post-grad endeavors? How important is ABET accreditation for the job market? Particularly if I want to work in government research (i.e. at NASA, DHS, FEMA, etc.) or policy?  \n\nI\u2019d also really love to know\u2026\n\n* How is the ESE program at Stanford? Is it really competitive / difficult? Is it possible to also minor in something like CS or public policy?\n* What is the transfer community at Stanford like?\n* What research opportunities in ESE (available to undergrads) would you recommend that I look into?\n* Is it feasible to hold a part-time job while also completing a degree? I\u2019m currently working as a researcher at a gov agency, and I really want to continue that during the remainder of my undergrad experience.\n\nThank you so much!!",

            "comment": "ABET doesn\u2019t usually matter unless you want to work as a civil engineer or a power engineer. Many federal agencies require their engineers to have ABET degrees, but give exceptions if the person has completed the basic fundamentals at an accredited university. Stanford is more than that so you\u2019ll be fine. Checkout USAJOBS.gov for the requirements for the positions you\u2019re interested in.\n\n\n(A policy job would never require a PE because a PE would never waste their credential, which is time consuming to get and offers a considerable pay boost, on a policy job.)",

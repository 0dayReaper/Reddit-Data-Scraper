    "postText": "I\u2019ve heard that Stanford housing is not the best for undergrads. I\u2019m hoping for a dorm experience similar to the residential colleges at schools like Harvard, Yale, or Notre Dame. I understand Stanford doesn\u2019t have residential colleges like these schools, but does the housing system at least promote some degree of finding a community within the building you live? Or is is really just a building where people only come to sleep? Any insight would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "Frosh dorms host a lot of activities for the primary aim of fostering dorm community. Moreover, just as anecdotal evidence, I and many other frosh I've talked to have made a lot (if not most/all) of our friends through our dorm.\n\nYes, in essence, the dorm is just a place to sleep in. The system itself is as typical is at gets. But the activities and people, from my experience, have made it great\n\nHope this helps!",

I just wanted to make sure Stanford dorms still had some degree of community, and it seems they do.\n\nFollow-up question: are you and your dorm friends going to stay together in the same dorm, or will you be split up/sent to different dorms next year? Sorry - I'm not particularly familiar with the housing system lol. And also, what were some of the activities they organized for freshman? Thanks sm!",

Stanford's housing system (or the neighborhood system, as it's officially called) is a little bit convoluted, as you might've realized by now. Long story short, for every year besides freshman year, everyone can pick several options out of the many many living spaces on campus (which options are available to you is random and determined by your frosh dorm assignment). You can go in groups of up to 10 (I think) into the housing app to choose next year's housing - in this way, if 10 people wanted to choose the same option, y'all could stay together (sorry this explanation was kind of rough)\n\nThere have been so many cool activities! It differs by dorm. I'm pretty sure every frosh dorm organizes a \"scavenger hunt\" in SF (basically just a day long trip to SF, you can do pretty much whatever you want). Some other highlights, both from my dorm and from others, include Yosemite trips and prom-type dances on yachts. There's a lot more than that - I'd say usually you'd have a fairly big event every 1-2 months - but I've just forgotten a lot of them lol",

It\u2019s in its awkward Guinea pig phase and the undergrad base isn\u2019t really embracing it, and unless they make some changes to it, I don\u2019t think it will be embraced for a while. It\u2019s tough because the system works well at other schools when students are physically separated into\u2026 neighborhoods. Campus dorms aren\u2019t very spread out and our \u201cneighborhoods\u201d literally encompass the same buildings sometimes, so it really just limits who you can room with. I can\u2019t room with any of my friends because of it, but at least I have friends I made before the new system got deployed \ud83d\ude05\n\nHonestly though, you\u2019ll probably be fine because you will experience it all 4 years, but it is sad to hear the tales about the \u201cmuch better\u201d social culture that existed before COVID.",

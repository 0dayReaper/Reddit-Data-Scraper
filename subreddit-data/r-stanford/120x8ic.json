    "postText": "Hello everyone, I got admitted to MS&amp;E! I would be grateful if any first- or second-year student could answer the following questions for me. I am honestly excited but kind of overwhelmed (by costs, being far from family, and imposter syndrome): \n\n* Are classes in the computational social science or Decision Analysis concentration difficult? I have been working for the last 4 years, and my linear algebra/probability basis is a bit rusty.\n* Is it possible to work as a TA/RA in the first quarter? \n* What classes would you suggest I take if I want to focus my career on the intersection of data and consulting? \n* Finally, it would be cool to connect with some MS MS&amp;E incoming, current, or former students. \n\nThanks a lot!",

Mostly a survey class and you have your own leeway in where you want to go with a course project.\n* Yes, you have to be relatively aggressive though. I was able to TA in CS first quarter, and have friends who were able to get long-term RAs in the med school. Definitely feasible though.\n* CS 246 (Data Mining), CS 145 (Databases), CS 149 (Parallel Comp) are pretty neat. There's a ton of ML courses as well, of course.",

                    "comment": "\n\nThe letter is quite long, and the opening pages may be more difficult to read for those less familiar with the law cases cited. That being said, I'd like to share a few passages from the letter that struck me:\n\n*Note: I've made minor formatting edits and bolded certain pharses. No other changes were made to the quotes.*\n\n**On whether Law Students should allow for discussion on positions they believe morally unjust**\n&gt;Some students might feel that some points should not be up for argument and therefore that they should not bear the responsibility of arguing them (or even hearing arguments about them), but however appealing that position might be in some other context, it is incompatible with the training that must be delivered in a law school. \n&gt;\n&gt;Law students are entering a profession in which their job is to make arguments on behalf of clients whose very lives may depend on their professional skill. \n&gt;\n&gt;Just as doctors in training must learn to face suffering and death and respond in their professional role, lawyers in training must learn to confront injustice or views they don\u2019t agree with and respond as attorneys.\n\n**On Law's unique position in mediating conflict**\n&gt; Law is a mediating device for difference. It therefore reflects all the heat of controversy, all  the pain and suffering, and all the deeply felt moral urgency of our differences in position,  power, and cherished principles.\n\n**On how Dean Martinze believes Law students should engage with beliefs they find morally reprehensible**\n&gt; Naming perceived  harm, exploring it, and debating solutions with people who disagree about the nature and fact of the harm or the correct solutions are the very essence of legal work. Lively, candid, civil, and evidence-based discourse in disagreement is not just positive for our community, constituted as it is in difference, it is a professional duty. \n&gt; \n&gt; **Observance of this duty matters most, not least, when we are convinced that others haven\u2019t.**\n\n**On what this event raises about how we discuss controversial topics**\n&gt; There are fundamental issues to consider here beyond the issues of formal law and university policy. They have to do with choices for which all of us are responsible in building a community dedicated to learning and to preparation for the practice of law. With regard to the norms of this community, the cycle of degenerating discourse won\u2019t stop if we insist that people we disagree with must first behave the way we want them to. Nor will it stop if we try to shame each other into submission (shaming, the research shows, has precisely the opposite effect in communities constituted by difference). \n&gt; \n&gt; The cycle stops when we recognize our responsibility to treat each other with the dignity with which we expect to be met. **It stops when we choose to replace condemnation with curiosity, invective with inquiry**. \n&gt; \n&gt; I remain dedicated to cultivating these norms in our community.",

            "comment": "The fact that something like this happened is quite amazing to me.\n\nWhen I was in high school ages ago in a different (democratic) country, we had a communist teacher, a real party-member communist.  He thought us critical thinking, how to dissect arguments, and how to identify the pros and cons of various ideologies.  He even had us practice these skills on his communist beliefs, and he even took part in the exercises and he did not hold back.  This was in high school and he was probably one of the most enlightening teachers I have ever had.\n\nAnd here we are at one of the world's most prestigious law schools in the world, one that has produced Supreme Court justices, one that is part of a university that stands for academic freedom, intellectual curiosity, rigor, and constant exploration, but with an administrator actively silencing dissenting views, preventing others from engaging in discussions, and students doing the same.  It is simply mind blowing to me.  A university is supposed to be a place where you analyze and discuss ideologies different from yours, including those that make you feel uncomfortable and even scared.\n\nSuch events driven by self-righteous intolerance and narrow-mindedness have been happening more and more frequently in universities across the US.  I am glad the Dean has taken a stand to remind everyone about the very basic and fundamental mission of universities:\n\n*Stanford University\u2019s central functions of teaching, learning, research, and\nscholarship depend upon an atmosphere in which freedom of inquiry, thought,\nexpression, publication and peaceable assembly are given the fullest protection.\nExpression of the widest range of viewpoints should be encouraged, free from\ninstitutional orthodoxy and from internal or external coercion.*",

Look at how the law school handles their zoom talks, with no chat, all questions held for moderation, and moderators who bend over backwards to avoid guest discomfort. If the Federalist Society wants to ensure that their speakers have a platform free from dissent, they would get the Law School Zoom team to host them.",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m currently a senior deciding between Stanford and brown and I really only have a couple hours left. Can anyone comment on Stanford vs Brown for chemistry undergrad? I\u2019ve heard a lot about the bubble, duck syndrome, kinda terrible chem department, inability to retain coursework from short quarter systems, but nice weather, supportive community, rank (lol for chem bc brown is 51 but I\u2019ve heard more positives that will probably do better than rank itself) and great athletics. Yet, I\u2019m not quite sure about their grad focused environment. I\u2019m not pre-med and would like to go into Mat. Sciences/ environment chem! Stanford was around 3k cheaper too if that helps. Thank you so much!\n\nWould passing up Stanfords resources and environment be a mistake?\n\nUpdate: Chose Stanford :)",

My inclination is that this is partly because there are a great many incredible high school chemistry teachers who show how fun, interesting, and intellectual chemistry can be, and then students get to college and find crappy teaching with a huge step-up in challenging material. \n\nIt is true that high school-level chemistry (and physics, for that matter) is not nearly as hard as college-level chemistry (AP Chem notwithstanding), particularly once you get past the intro course. But, the teaching needs to be stepped up to compete with some of the other hot majors, as well.",

Brown produced a total of 1 Nobel prize winner (in Chemistry). Looking at their current faculty in organic, there's nobody I've ever heard of. \n\nAlso consider if ChemE, materials science and engineering, or other engineering disciplines interest you. If I had the chance to do undergrad over again, I'd have majored in ChemE instead of chemistry.",

Completely unsupportive when a parent died, forgetting the undergrads exist, a sexist professor with tenure, a possible murder/affair (not sure how true this one is but it's too juicy to not tell you haha).\n\nMy fiancee thought she might do chem freshman year but then dropped it cuz of various issues as well.\n\nThat said there are some AMAZING opportunities here that you won't get at Brown. Sophomore year one of them was already in a lab working in cutting edge research on solar panels. The other is also in a lab but I'm too humanity brained to understand what they do. Even with the general discontent they have with the department itself, they're doing really cool things. Also, the undergrads themselves are super tight cuz there aren't a ton of chem majors. A lot of collaboration.\n\nAt the end of the day, if I were you I'd come here if you have a little bit of a masochistic streak because the opportunities really are mind blowing. Even if the department sucks, the Stanford name will get you into tons of interesting things. If you're capable of pursuing your interests independently, you'll be WAY better off here, and if you decide not to go into chemistry down the road, the rest of our departments are (usually) heads and tails above Brown's.",

It\u2019s also just incredibly fortunate to get a chance to come somewhere like Stanford with so many other departments doing cutting edge work, and you definitely won\u2019t regret all the other experiences you\u2019ll have access to outside of chem (including all kinds of other niche fields you discover while here). One downside is that if you want to do a PhD, most departments won\u2019t accept their own undergrads into their PhD programs. That said, there\u2019s no guarantee anyone gets into the PhD program anyway, and you\u2019ll have great options and connections moving on and you can always go somewhere like CalTech/Berkeley/Harvard/MIT that have pretty great chem departments as well. That part really is a bummer because I would say if you had to choose one, between undergrad and grad school, the grad program at Stanford is hard to beat, but it\u2019s still a pretty hard option to turn down given that you never know where you\u2019ll end up in the future. You\u2019ll have plenty of other great options at Stanford as well, including engineering etc that you wouldn\u2019t have nearly as much of at brown. I do think you should be prepared for the tradeoff that brown is probably more of an undergrad-centric environment for chem, which in some ways is nice (personally biased having chosen liberal arts for undergrad), but tbh Stanford is just such a great opportunity to explore beyond what you\u2019d ever see otherwise that I really wouldn\u2019t advise turning it down, as long as you\u2019re prepared to be part of a bigger pond. It\u2019s a great department and you\u2019ll get to learn from some of the most interesting professors on the planet, as well as get mentorship from grad students who have all kinds of interesting experience, and access to other departments that are really hard to match. It\u2019s mind boggling how many cool things undergrads get to explore, and you\u2019ll have your pick of whatever you want to do when you\u2019re done. Hopefully we\u2019ll get to see you here, but good luck with your decision either way!",

Ime the biggest distinction is that at a liberal arts school the purpose of professors and labs is to train you, and at a larger research institution like Stanford your training is important (and there are some fantastic mentors who can help you go far), but you\u2019ll get a different experience because there\u2019s generally someone more senior who\u2019s training you and doing the primary research in the labs as well. In one case you get more latitude and seniority, and in the other you get mentorship from some truly fantastic colleagues and access to what\u2019s generally more cutting-edge research, though it may require a little more independence to navigate as well. Which you prefer is really up to you, and if you take the initiative to find interesting research opportunities you\u2019ll definitely have no shortage of great experiences either way, but the access at Stanford is also hard to beat. The department will also arm you with a lot but they\u2019ll also expect a lot, and you\u2019ll work hard while you\u2019re here, though it\u2019s definitely still a positive environment and you probably would anywhere if you\u2019re majoring in chem. The chem majors I\u2019ve TAed have generally loved it, and they get a great education that\u2019s miles ahead of what most people elsewhere get to learn. If you\u2019ve gotten in and you like chem though you should be just fine, and you\u2019ll have lots of TAs to support you as you learn. If you really know for sure you want a mostly undergrad environment you might consider brown, but if you\u2019re curious about other areas and want to maximize your options and opportunities, as long as you\u2019re comfortable in a slightly bigger environment, Stanford will offer you all kinds of opportunities you wouldn\u2019t get anywhere else",

Fantastic departments and higher-level courses that will arm you with cutting edge knowledge for whatever you want to do, plus courses in adjacent disciplines that will give you a rounded view from different perspectives and help you think about whatever you decide to do next. Sometimes I honestly wish a could stay here forever just for that (though arguably a PhD is the next best thing). The professors are all at the edge of their disciplines, and you get to learn directly from super competent experts about all the latest research they\u2019re developing in their labs. You\u2019ll also get to meet grad students and postdocs who came from all kinds of institutions, which is great if you want leads for grad school and insights into other areas. Companies and other grad programs love to recruit experience from labs doing cutting edge research as well\u2014you\u2019ll have all kinds of options by the time you leave",

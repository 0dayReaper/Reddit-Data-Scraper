    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm gonna be living at villages at Cupertino this summer. I'm interning in Palo Alto but I'm looking for a way to meet students and get involved in some friend groups or clubs on campus. I'm big into lifting and am in a big fraternity at Clemson, although it doesn't seem like that same fraternity is much of a thing here. But somehow getting involved in Greek life as a temporary outsider would be great. Let me know if you have any ideas, thanks!",

There aren't really parties or anything either. I also don't know how open Stanford undergrads are to hanging out with students from other universities/students not living on campus that are convenient to hang out with. That's not to bash on any of the students, it's just the vibe of the student body.\n\nYou might have better luck reaching out to Santa Clara though!",

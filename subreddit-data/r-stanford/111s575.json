    "postText": "I'm new to Stanford. I went to the Pop Up Food Pantry event they had today. I took a couple cartons of eggs, milk, and some produce. I thought I was getting greedy with how much I took until I saw people packing suitcases and carts full of food. I realize the [website](https://rde.stanford.edu/food-pantry-pop-up) encourages this and each portion is meant for a family of four. However, I can't help but think that most of this food is better off at a homeless shelter. I understand someone taking 1 or 2 packs of mushrooms but stuffing 6 or 7 packs in their suitcases seems ridiculous. Like Jenny, I know you're not going to use 5 gallons of milk in the next week or two.",

The people grabbing a ton of food might not just be feeding themselves. just head into EV near couples and families housing and you'll see a ton of people with multiple children. some people do have a lot of mouths to feed and take care of on a grad student salary...",

Honestly, with growing kids, 5 gallons of milk sometimes CAN go through in two weeks.  But it\u2019s most likely that these families are helping their neighbors who can\u2019t make it to the pop up at a certain time or day.\n\nInstead of bitching about people taking food, maybe question why there\u2019s this level of desperation in the first place.",

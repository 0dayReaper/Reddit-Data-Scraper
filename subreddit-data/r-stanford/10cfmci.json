    "postText": "I did my undergrad at a state university and pretty much sacrificed a lot of explorative ventures to focus on a high GPA.\nI was wondering if I need to maintain the same effort to perform at the same caliber, or I can take my foot off the pedal and focus more on research/internships/personal projects.\n\nIn general, I've noticed that graduate students have a relatively higher GPA than their undergrad.\n\nTIA!",

Most classes are like 5% A+, 30% each for A A- B+. \n\nmany classes have a huge time commitment and are extremely difficult though. if you skip a pset or are generally phoning it in, you can quickly be the lowest grade in the class. \n\nFor me this was the biggest culture shock - in the hardest courses at the UC i attended in undergrad, nobody finished assignments so i could kinda stop at 85%. Stanford students get that shit to 100% if its possible.",

            "comment": "It's worthwhile to first question whether you need a high GPA for whatever your post-Stanford  MS goals are. If they're to get into grad school (i.e., a PhD), it's likely you should focus more on research than your GPA.\n\nIf it's to get into industry, I think you would be better off trying to secure internships, network with people in industry or otherwise improving your resume. You don't need to list your GPA when applying for most positions, and it's not weighted very heavily by recruiters.",

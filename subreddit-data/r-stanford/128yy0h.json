    "postText": "I just wanted to learn a bit more about Stanford's culture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI specifically wanted to know how high pressure it is, and whether or not there is a sense of mistrust/competition/snaking among students. I understand this is present on every college campus to some degree, but I want to know if Stanford has it worse than average. Also, do Stanford students stress out a ton? And is that stress usually self-induced or due to excessive coursework/expectations?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long list of questions, and thanks so much in advance!!!",

It\u2019s stressful in that people want to get good grades/research opportunities/work for startups but since basically  no one flunks out, it\u2019s not that cutthroat.",

            "comment": "I would not describe this place as high pressure because this place makes it incredibly easy to get whatever it is you want. The struggle is in finding out what it is you want.\n\nIf you want a ridiculously high GPA, the fact we have A+ grades which give 4.3/4.0 make it very much possible to maintain a &gt;4.0 GPA throughout the time that you spend here. You won't stress about classes if you rock up, do the work, and have the humility to accept those cases where you have signed up for too many units and adjust your quarter accordingly. \n\nIf you want a good job after graduating, the Stanford name carries more weight now than it ever has. There is also an extensive alumni network, and if you are even mildly socially adept you can make connections that will net you jobs in ways that don't require a CV, or an interview, or an application - just a handshake, a pat on the back, and a celebratory drink and voila, you're in. I've seen it happen with my own two eyes. In fact, this very summer I'm working a job I was told to apply for, and the outcome of that application was never in doubt, considering the person who told me to apply was firstly a close friend, and secondly was the person choosing the successful applicants. Just don't be the creep who befriends people just for the sake of \"networking\", and you'll be fine. \n\nI will say though that if you want a good time, you can find it - but I hesitate to say that the party scene is good here, because it's kinda aggressively meh.\n\nPeople do get stressed out while they are here, but people get stressed out while they're anywhere. It happens. Life can suck sometimes, and that's ok. Being stressed is not a Stanford-exclusive attribute. Chances are, if you're stressed, at least your heart is in the right place.",

            "comment": "current stanford sophomore here; personally stanford has something called the duck syndrome. It's very real tbh where the campus is pretty competitive in majority STEM majors. I will say, if you have a supportive friend group then it would be easier for you to get over the competitive nature that comes from such a selected student body like stanford. keep in mind you are joining a community of students coming from 4.0+ highschool GPAs, 1st place in National AND international competitions, straight 5s on AP exams, private highschool, etc. So you should expect that people will likely want to succeed and emit that 4.0+ energy that most if not all came here from. \n\nNevertheless, it is a pretty open campus and not everyone strives to be the top 1% here so you'll find a pretty healthy balance with some people the same way you can expect the former. DM if you have anymore questions :)",

In my day, there was even a CS+ X joint major program (CS + Linguistics/Art/English/Etc.) but it\u2019s been discontinued. \n\nP.S. advisor folks will probably tell you this as well\u2014if they haven\u2019t already\u2014but given the bureaucracy of the University, another option on the table is to major in CS and co-term in something else or vice versa! \n\nGood luck OP",

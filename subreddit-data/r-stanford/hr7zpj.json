International students are not pawns for politics.\nAlso - you realize that moving everything to online is the safest option, yet are \u201cconcerned\u201d about it? Shouldn\u2019t we be more concerned that the number of cases keep increasing?",

Even if they can, travel can be prohibitively expensive, and unfairly exposes them to risk of infection.\n- Normally when students enroll and study online (as is the restriction during pre-COVID times), the schools they are enrolled in are prepared for asynchronous instruction across widely different time zones. Not every school is. I have international friends who wake up at 9pm and go to bed at 5am to get the same instruction as their domestic peers.\n- If cases increase to the point where colleges have to send everyone home (like they did in March), this policy will only allow students 10 days to leave the country. It\u2019s impossible for every international student to find tickets back home in such short notice.\n\nTL;DR: while what you said is true and is the rationale usually followed, it\u2019s cruel to do so right now at the peak of a pandemic.",

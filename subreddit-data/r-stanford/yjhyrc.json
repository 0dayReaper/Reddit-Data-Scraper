    "postText": "I've had a very emotionally intense past month given some personal circumstances that have come about unexpectedly. I neglected going to class and doing any class work for the past 3 weeks, basically zoned out Stanford entirely during this period of time. I'm honestly not sure the best plan of action for a soft landing to the end of this quarter. I think I've accepted I'll be withdrawing from a course or 2 given I have missed deadlines and am skipping the midterm, but I don't know how that would work for an entire quarter of classes.\n\nAside from individually reaching out to the professors to let them know, I would massively appreciate any advice on how to handle this now.",

            "comment": "Talk to your professors about the potential to get an incomplete grade for the classes. Might be tricky given that it's mid-way through the quarter and you haven't had the chance to finish a whole lot of work, and different professors have different feelings about I grades, but it's worth a shot. When I was a TA, we tried to be very accommodating and offered students who had come to us considering dropping the opportunity to take an I instead.",

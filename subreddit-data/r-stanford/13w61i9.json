It\u2019s tough, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through it. \n\nMy suggestions:\n- Go to the goofy shit your RA is organizing \n- Find interest-based groups and attend them, if that causes too much anxiety then start by joining their email lists\n- Make small talk with classmates and people around campus (eg, in line at the post office)\n- Ask for help and lend help to others \n- Resist the urge to spend more and more time in your room\u2026 make sure to get out for exercise, eat in the dining hall even if you need to bring a book, do homework in the dorm lounge or library\n- Take a social dance class or similar \n- Go to professor and TA office hours, they won\u2019t be your friends but it\u2019s a social outlet",

I made a lot of friends and acquaintances that year - I still have many of those connections. \n\nI\u2019m an introvert (I really am), but you have to put yourself out there. There are so many activity and academic groups. It\u2019s a matter of putting forth the effort.",

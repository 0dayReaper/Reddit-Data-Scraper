    "postText": "So I am really considering withdrawing from 51 as the second midterm is coming up and I don\u2019t feel confident about it in the slightest. I already did poor on the first one so this is definitely going to nuke my GPA. \n\nOnly issue is this puts me at 10 units and then I\u2019m left with the issue of what to do next quarter. I made the jump from 19 to 51 which in hindsight was very dumb. I took BC in hs but essentially forgot everything so I should have taken 20.  \n\nI really underestimated how much work it would take to do well as a STEM student and it\u2019s coming back to bite me in the ass. Please provide any advice. I\u2019m willing to take courses in the summer if need be.",

Even if you get pretty bad grades on the midterms you will likely still pass, perhaps talking to an instructor or TA in the class about how you\u2019re doing could help. having a lower grade on your transcript from freshmen year really won\u2019t effect you that much later",

Threw my book against a wall in frustration because I had never failed anything before - probably wouldn't have been an actual F, but might as well have given Stanford grade inflation.\n\nDropped to 41, put my heart into my CS and chem classes for the rest of the year, and went back to the Physics 60s the next year.  Have had a pretty good life since then.\n\nPut in the effort going forward &amp; you'll be fine.",

I was a CS major, I got a C (or was it a C-\u2026) in 107 and thought my life was over and I couldn\u2019t handle stem. I got some advice and fresh perspectives, didn\u2019t even retake it and ended up with a 3.6 gpa overall. Gpa isn\u2019t everything, freshman year can be tough, if you can handle it financially you don\u2019t need to graduate in 4 years (you may be able to do reduced course load which also involves paying less for the quarter) you\u2019re at Stanford and these are tough classes, but you wouldn\u2019t be there if people didn\u2019t have a ton of faith that you could handle it. If you\u2019re feeling stressed and anxious, I would talk to someone and consider lowering your course load until you feel more solid - this is something a lot of people wisely do and your health comes first!",

    "postText": "I believe success should not be determined by where we go to college, in 2023, American \"collegiate meritocracy\" is a broken system. \n\nI'm a CS student out of WashU. This summer I'm working with a startup (Entre) that's democratizing entrepreneurship. We're building a platform for like-minded programmers, designers, &amp; founders to build, distribute resources, and collaborate. **The mission is making the competitive advantages of places like MIT and Harvard significantly more obsolete.**\n\nIf you'd benefit from a remote resources &amp; support in how to make entrepreneurship a realistic, viable career option, we need some pilot users from Stanford to give our Collegiate Community a test run. Entre has already started with migrating 90,000 existing founders &amp; programmers onto the platform, but now must turn attention towards my age demographic (hence my efforts this summer).\n\nBased on current fundraising, we're aiming to acquire 1M users by the end of the year. I'm happy to answer any questions and provide more info upon request.\n\nIf interested, leave a comment on this post, or dm this account, and I'll shoot out an invite link so you can see everything for yourself.\n\nThanks!",

By aggregating intelligent students from across the world, Stanford included, it creates a powerful network. I'll pm you with a link &amp; info.",

Not terribly interested in chipping away at that while I'm still a student here...",

But I'm a bit unsure of the workload, and if it will negatively impact my freshmen year social experience. I know these questions are mentioned on the website, but I woud love a second opinion from anyone who has tried SLE.",

I didn\u2019t feel like it negatively impacted my social experience whatsoever. I made friends within the dorm and in my other classes, and I still had time to participate in clubs and other activities.",

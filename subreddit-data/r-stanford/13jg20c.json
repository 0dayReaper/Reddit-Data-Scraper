The link to join is on this page: [https://advising.stanford.edu/beyond-undergrad/planning-medical-school](https://advising.stanford.edu/beyond-undergrad/planning-medical-school) Also, most of the medical organizations (especially the diversity ones) likely have upperclassmen willing to share and you could maybe message them on insta in you want to start planning now. I'm not sure who is in charge now but when I was new here an upperclassman in SWIM ([https://www.instagram.com/stanfordwomeninmedicine/](https://www.instagram.com/stanfordwomeninmedicine/)) joined my class's groupie and shared info like this so it might be a good place to start",

    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nAfter finishing up with my bachelor\u2019s degree next spring, I\u2019m looking at applying to Stanford\u2019s computer science program for a Master\u2019s degree. With that being said, what are the key differences between going in-person for this degree and doing an online master\u2019s degree. Are there any key benefits I would miss out on by doing it online?",

I believe HCP status also requires you to work full-time and only allows for part-time enrollment, but these two features are not enforced, in practice. Admission criteria are the same (HCP is just a designation, not a separate program.)\n\n\nThere are many soft benefits to being on campus, though. Unless you\u2019re doing HCP because you\u2019re working FT with tuition assistance via your employer you should come to campus.",

You'll struggle to find a partner. \nAlso office hours for homework help are lower quality. The TA might get asked about a homework problem and provide help improntu. Unless they have a web cam going you're going to miss out on that. \nLectures are about even. lol the in person students skip lecture and watch the recording later",

    "postText": "Prefrosh here. I recently chose Stanford over Wharton undergrad, and I\u2019m getting slight cold feet. I know career isn\u2019t the only thing that matters, and I prefer literally EVERYTHING ELSE about Stanford more than Penn, but I was still slightly concerned about future career opportunities. Looking online, Stanford places slightly worse that Wharton for consulting and much worse for IB. I know this is likely due to less students interested in the field, but are there ample opportunities to break into IB or other finance fields from Stanford?\n\nHow much easier/harder will pursuing finance be in comparison to kids pursuing IB at Penn? \n\nCan I break into East coast finance - or will I be mostly funneled into California finance? I\u2019d prefer to work on the east coast.\n\nAre there upperclassmen/groups at Stanford willing to help underclassmen break into finance? \n\nAnd lastly, are there any opportunities in finance that i may have lost out on by choosing Stanford? \n\nSorry for the long list of questions - any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated :)!!!",

You may not even end up wanting to do finance.",

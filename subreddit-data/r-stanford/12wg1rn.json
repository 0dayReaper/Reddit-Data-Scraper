    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming law student that\u2019s super conflicted over housing options. My top choices are the EV studio, Kennedy 2b/2b junior, and EVGR 2b/2b junior. I have two concerns:\n\nThe junior double fits my lifestyle the best but I\u2019m worried about being in a nightmare roommate situation. I\u2019m a super light sleeper and a notorious germaphobe. I see a shared kitchen defraying me from cooking at all. I\u2019ll likely eat out or go to a dining hall for most of my lunches/dinners but I\u2019d like the option to cook.\n\nThe roommate stuff has given me so much anxiety that I\u2019m looking into the EV studio. It\u2019s pricier and a bit farther away but perhaps paying extra is worth it for the peace of mind.\n\nAnother issue is that all of these options are year-long contracts and not academic ones. I do like the idea of staying in one place for 3 years but I\u2019m really worried about subleasing. \n\nI would really appreciate any insights on the junior suite vs studio dilemma and my contracts dilemma. I wasn't able to attend admit weekend and SLS has been no help.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m also a massive germaphobe and I ended up staying in one of the EVGR studios. Best decision ever for me. Wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend the Kennedy junior as the kitchen is quite small. EVGR junior\u2019s kitchen is a bit bigger but also shared. The EV studios are alright but as you\u2019ve said, they aren\u2019t as close to the other buildings.",

I don't spend much time in my room so I feel like splurging on a studio would be a waste. Im considering just taking all my meals in the dining hall just to avoid the common kitchen.",

It\u2019s only 5 minutes away from EVGR and I get access to the theatre rooms and game rooms in EVGR whether through my card access or my friends\u2019. I also like being closer to El Camino Real and California Ave. \n\nI think the EVGR studios are the same as the EV studios in terms of area, only very slightly bigger and the kitchen equipment are slightly newer. The differences don\u2019t justify the difference in price for me personally. \n\nLmk if you have any questions!",

I also never asked friends to provide access for me to them because they only really have very few equipment. Instead I would go to the Arillaga gym/recreation center which we all have access to. \n\nParking is available through permit parking (Resident Parking). EVGR have Thoburn garages and Manzanita garages and a couple of parking lots. EV studios have several parking lots for residents parking. I haven\u2019t had issue with parking. \n\nN.B. resident permits allow us to park anywhere around campus for resident parking. \n\nWiFi is good, can\u2019t complain. I do recommend connecting your PC or laptop to an Ethernet instead of wireless connection. Ethernet is magnitudes faster.",

            "comment": "There's the option to apply for reassignment during the year if you don't end up liking what you get. I lived in a Kennedy 2b/2b junior. My main complaints were that kitchen was really cramped and the fridge was way too small for 2 people. My roommate was not the cleanest in the kitchen and this did dissuade me from cooking. The cramped kitchen space definitely magnified the problem. The walls are thin enough that if someone takes a zoom call, their roommate can definitely hear it even with both room doors closed. I think the EVGR 2b/2b junior are a bit bigger and there's more space to work with, imo.",

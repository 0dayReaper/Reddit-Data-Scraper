The units don't match up, as GDP measures economic activity per unit time not the net present value of all future economic activity in a country.\n\nThe value of Stanford's endowment is far higher than what it earns in interest every year. Likewise, if you could put a price on a country's entire economy, that price would be much higher than annual GDP.",

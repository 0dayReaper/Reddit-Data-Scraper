    "postText": "Hello guys, I have just been accepted for an exchange semester at the Stanford Law School - very excited about this.\n\nAs I am, unfortunately, not qualified for on-campus living, I wanted to kindly ask you if you knew any place on the internet that I could look at for housing. \n\nThe budget will be whatever it needs to be (reasonably) but I would like to only look at reliable sources. E.g. I wouldn't want to search through craigslist. Are there any safe Facebook groups that one could recommend? What about host families? \n\nI am grateful for every serious answer!",

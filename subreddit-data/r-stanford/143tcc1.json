    "postText": "I'm a high school student that will be doing work in a Stanford lab on the weekdays during the summer. My parents are only free to drive me to and from the campus at specific times, so I might have to stay on campus for an hour or more while I wait for them to pick me up\n\nAre there any spots on campus (or close by) I could wait at? I know I can only go to the library for a limited amount of visits, so I was wondering if there were any better spots for me to stay at. I would like to do homework while I wait, so somewhere with wifi and a table would be nice. I'm not familiar with cafes and study spots, and I don't want to disturb actual students trying to work, so any help would be appreciated!\n\nI'm also not sure what the rules are for visitors staying on campus for long-ish periods of time, and if there's anything I need to keep in mind please lmk",

You can just walk in on business hours and grab a random desk in one of the public areas. \n\n2) Same for the Packard Electrical Engineering building. The Bytes cafe on the first floor here is open until 4pm and you can eat lunch here. On the second floor there's a nice kitchenette with tables where you can chill. You can just walk in on weekdays until 6pm.\n\n3) Coupa cafe near Green Library is super nice in the summer. You can sit outside.\n\n4) Same for Coupa cafe at Y2E2.\n\n5) On the ground floor of the Huang Engineering Center, there's tables and chairs where people sit and study. It's open throughout the day. The entrance is on the engineering quad. There's a Coupa cafe here too, and a restaurant where you can grab a byte.\n\n6) The outdoors area on the northwest of Lane Medical Library has a fountain and chairs/tables to sit at.\n\n7) If you want to sit inside, go to the Old Union building near the White Plaza. You can sit at the ground floor or the second floor, there's chairs and sofas. There are chairs and sofas inside, and chairs right outside in the courtyard. There's also more chairs on White Plaza itself.\n\n8) The basement floor of the Durand Material Sciences building has some comfy sofas.\n\n9) The Tresidder area has many shops to buy coffee or food (CoHo, Treehouse, Starbucks, Panda Express). You can sit here inside or at the courtyard. It's very nice in the summer.\n\nThere's free visitor WiFi in all of these areas. Computer Science have their own WiFi in case the main WiFi doesn't work. All the indoor areas have power plugs. There's bathrooms in most of these places.\n\nAll of the above areas are quite public places and you're not disturbing anyone as long as you're not super loud.\n\nDM if you need more help. Welcome!",

He had a particular way of teaching that class, so it may be quite different from how Nick Trocolli is teaching it.\n\nYou can see a brief explanation of CS 140 and how it relates to 111 and 110 here: https://web.stanford.edu/\\~ouster/cs111-spring21/110/",

            "comment": "I'm taking CS111 this quarter. In my opinion, it has one of the most manageable workloads out of the CS classes I've taken, so they most likely revamped it considering the bad reviews it had last year.\nThere's only 6 assignments, so one every 1.5 to 2 weeks. Each assignment is a decent challenge because it's still C, but I say it's around 30%? less work than a typical CS107 assignment (but I guess you've learned more by now). You also don't have to comment your code because they don't grade for style. For all of the assignments except for one so far, they've given you all the test cases so you don't even have to write them yourself!",

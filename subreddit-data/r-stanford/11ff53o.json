You are probably better off not attending and letting him spew nonsense to an empty room.  Can't publicize your arguments when the video shows you weren't worth the platform.",

Take a chair a apart and all you have are 2 pieces of whatever it\u2019s made of. So that one doesn\u2019t work the way you thought it did. \n\nThe Rocking horse doesn\u2019t have a back. All it has is a seat and a small flap so it\u2019s not a chair either. It\u2019s also designed for the purpose of entertaining a child not for sitting down. No idea why you posted that. \n\nCalling something a different term such as \u201ckneeling chair\u201d implies that it\u2019s different from a  chair or else you wouldn\u2019t have different terminology for it. You would just call it a chair. But you don\u2019t because it\u2019s a different thing. \n\n\nThe last image is literally described on Amazon as \u201cchairs w/Sun Protective Canopy, Table Beverage Holder &amp; Storage Bag\u201d. The description says it\u2019s 2 chairs with a bunch of other stuff. Not sure why you think that\u2019s a gotcha. \n\nSo that was a big swing and a miss on your part. It was funny to see you be so arrogant and then face-plant but that\u2019s expected from someone who can\u2019t describe a chair other than \u201ca chair is a chair\u201d. \n\nEdit: you responded and then blocked me so I have no idea what you said but given that you blocked me as soon as you posted it, you must know it wasn\u2019t a good response since If you thought your response had any validity or merit you wouldn\u2019t have immediately blocked me so I would have no way to see it.

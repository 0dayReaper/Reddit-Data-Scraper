    "postText": "I come from a cs+ee background and in my last year at Stanford. I really want to take a robotics/autonomy course before graduating. From the course description, CS 237 (principles of robot autonomy) would have been perfect, but I wasn\u2019t able to take the autumn course and the winter version looks like a continuation. What is my next best alternative?\n\nI looked at CS 223A (intro to robotics) but it seems too ME focused.",

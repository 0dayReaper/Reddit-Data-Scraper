    "postText": "I\u2019m a little embarrassed to even be writing this post, but I know this is the best way for me not to feel alone. \n\nI was just admitted to a grad (MS) program in the School of Engineering, and while I was super excited for the first couple mins, the imposter syndrome kicked in -instantly-. \n\nI come from a really average university in the US. Granted, I did really well\u20144.0, top of my class, research experience and conference speaker, highly competitive internships, lots of ECs. Yet, I\u2019m terrified that the only reason I was able to do so well was because I was quite frankly surrounded by pretty average people. \n\nI\u2019m super excited for intellectual curiosity and stimulation that will come with attending Stanford, but I\u2019m very worried that I will go from being confident in my academics to drowning. At this point, I\u2019m even scared of failing out as a result of not being able to handle the academic rigor. \n\nDid you experience these feelings, too? Are there \u201cnormal\u201d people at Stanford (not just 5x published, Olympiad gold medalists)? Are there academic support services for grad students? Are classes impossibly hard? \n\nAny and all advice, support, stories, \u201cyou\u2019re not alone\u201d\u2019s would be of tremendous help!",

The classes aren\u2019t harder, conceptually speaking, but they do cover more material; the flip side is that there has been much more thought put into the design of the class and there\u2019s more support provided than at a state university, which typically don\u2019t have the funds to do so. The students are smarter, on average, yeah, but it\u2019s not as if everyone here is a genius. The main quality that really distinguishes Stanford students is their propensity for hard work.",

            "comment": "University curriculums are more or less equivalent in their content. Think about it, if you hire engineers from 2 different schools, same degree, you need to expect some consistency in what they know and are able to do. The reason why schools like Stanford are selective with who they recruit isn't because they think only the smartest people can handle their special content. Rather, the content is the same as anywhere else, and the reason to go to a school like stanford is so you can rub shoulders with other high achievers and build a network of opportunity + put \"Stanford\" on your resume. On Stanford's end, by being selective, they increase the chance that a higher percentage of their alumni will be highly successful, which both increases the reputation/desirability of the school as well as the likelihood of sizable postgrad donations. \n\nI know this from going to a public university school in undergrad and getting a job with many ivy league grads as coworkers. The school you go to doesn't dictate anything other than the opportunities you are exposed to.",

It's normal to feel imposter syndrome, but remember the wise words of Richard Fynman: \"Don't be so easily fooled as you are the easiest person to fool.\" Don't let your inner saboteur get in the way of your success. When comparing yourself to others, use their achievements as a springboard of inspiration rather than a way to bring yourself down. Also, don't forget that failure is the best teacher, embrace it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Finally, be proud of your achievements and the wonderful opportunities that they will introduce you to, both in and out of the classroom. Good luck, and enjoy the journey!",

One thing that I find helps alleviate this is how good the instructors are at showing you that you can make a meaningful contribution.\n\nFor example, most of the advanced AI classes (CS230, the various CS224\u2019s etc.) have a project component that\u2019s core to the learning experience. That pushes you to build cool things as a team, try new approaches, explore new features and improvements on baselines, etc. \n\nIn the end you have a project you can feel super proud of, and I find it incredibly empowering!\n\nIf you\u2019ve already published at conferences, chances are you\u2019re way ahead of the curve and much better at this than you seem to think. Worry not, you will be in high demand to work on team projects, and you\u2019ll feel right at home!",

Just a clarification, I haven\u2019t been published only selected to present at conferences. \n\nI\u2019m glad to hear about the project component though. Has this been other people\u2019s experiences? I think that\u2019s probably the best part of Stanford\u2014being able to work with such talented and hardworking people.",

From what I was told, there was a huge oversubscription for housing and basically every assignment was taken, which meant a lot of people didn\u2019t get their top choice. That said, it\u2019s usually been possibly to get reassigned to the same place even with medium priority, just probably not likely to get assigned there if you\u2019d be newly moving in, and especially not this last year. From what I\u2019ve heard that\u2019s in part due to undergrads taking up a lot of EVGR after COVID deferrals led to a larger-than-usual class",

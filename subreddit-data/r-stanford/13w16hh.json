    "postText": "Hi all, I am an international grad student from NCSU and will be interning near San Carlos this summer, it been a lifelong dream to visit Stanford and more so to  attend a stanford lecture atleast once.\n\nWould I require any permissions to attend a lecture ? If there isn't as such I would love a few recommendations , I will be working in person , so if there is any class  on weekends that would be great . I'm a Mech major and interested in Physics , Economics and  Production / Manfacturing Technology . Any suggestions would be appreciated",

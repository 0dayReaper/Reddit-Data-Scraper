    "postText": "Hi, I will be moving to USA for the first time to attend Stanford (grad student). Does anyone use ISO health insurance for international students? Does it have a good provider network in Palo Alto? ISO\u2019s provider network is Cigna, but I can\u2019t see which hospitals/clinics are included. \n\nCardinal Care fees seem too high and I would like to save some money if possible. If someone has used both insurances in different years, is the difference in healthcare services significant? \nI will need occasional dermatologist visits, but don\u2019t expect to visit a hospital/clinic otherwise unless there is an unforeseen emergency.",

They are super cheap compared to cardinal health insurance. Feel free to ask any other questions, Im an international grad student as well at Stanford!",

I just checked their in-network hospitals that are in Palo alto and many hospitals located nearby are in the provider network including the Stanford hospital which is located on campus. I am sure there are way more; I just checked for what's available within a 10 mile radius of the campus. Their website lets you search what is available in their network (physicians, clinics, hospitals, etc) in a certain area.",

This is the case regardless of insurance provider. Also, note that stanford healthcare has a generous financial assistance policy. I don't know grad students who've applied but I know a good amount of FLI undergrads who have had all their bills paid for after insurance. Hopefully you won't have an expensive visit and need it, but I just wanted to let you know in case something happens and you get a huge bill from them.",

(i.e. they are not considered real healthcare insurance by U.S. regulation standards)\n\nThey are cheap, but that's also because they have coverage limitations such as a payout maximum. You will also need to check if the desired provider is within their network. Read the terms carefully, and also try to find a provider before buying that insurance.\n\nAmerican health care system IS that expensive. Total cost of health insurance for an individual is 6-10k/yr, and you still have to pay deductible and co-pays for each visit. Cardinal care is already subsidized. The only reason other people see lower prices is that either their work, or their school, pays a higher portion of the insurance cost.\n\nI would totally get ISO if you're healthy and don't expect to use any issues, but I would be very suspect if you need regular visits to medical specialists",

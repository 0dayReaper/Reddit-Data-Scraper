    "postText": "Is there any program at Stanford similar to MIT Media Lab (Media Arts &amp; Sciences MS+PhD) or UC Berkeley iSchool Information Ph.D.? (See the full list for similar programs at the bottom.)\n\nI have backgrounds in UI &amp; UX design and Interactive Digital Media development. So far, I have found that Stanford offers an M.S. in Design and a Ph.D. in Education with a \u201cCross-Area Specialization - Learning Sciences and Technology Design,\u201d which also cross paths with design (they even work with the d.School at Stanford). The former highly matches my interests, while it\u2019s not a doctorate (I already have an M.S. in a Digital Media-related field). The latter seems limited to the field of education, specifically learning science.\n\nThe Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering is also cool, but since I\u2019m more of a designer trying to get into the research scene, idk if such an engineering program fits me and how hard it is to get in and complete my study.\n\nMaybe I missed something? Does anyone know if there\u2019re any other options at Stanford?\n\nThe full list for your reference (also the programs I\u2019m planning to apply to)\n- MIT Media Lab (Ph.D. Media Arts &amp; Science)\n- UC Berkeley School of Information (iSchool) Ph.D. Information)\n- UC Irvine School of Information Ph.D. Information\n- UC Santa Barbara Ph.D. Media Arts and Technology (MAT)\n- UC Santa Cruz Ph.D. Computational Media (CM)\n- CMU Ph.D. HCI\n- Georgia Tech Ph.D. Digital Media\n- Drexel Ph.D. Digital Media\n- Arizona State University Ph.D. Digital Culture",

Would you suggest applying for the Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering right away (risky or not?), or getting accepted into their M.S. in Design program first and starting working with one of them for research as a preparation for/transition to the Ph.D. in Mechanical as the next step (as their official website suggested?)",

It's definitely a cool program, and I like that it's very interdisciplinary and they collaborated with multiple departments, including the d.school. The only concern is the career outcome since idk if it's too limited to the field of learning science or overall education. However, it's definitely in my list.",

    "postText": "Hi all! New to sub, made a similar post to Columbia peers. I wanted to reach out and ask current Stanford students thoughts on grad life.  Currently deciding between Columbia SIPA and Stanford FSI for grad school. Coming straight out of undergrad, and originally from the East Coast (NJ). Costs are almost the same with Columbia being slightly more expensive for me. \n\nHow does an IR grad degree from Stanford compare to one from Columbia? Any thoughts will be appreciated :)",

Took the plunge for a MS, got to do a free PhD at stanfy and I can see myself living here in California long term. Different lifestyle for sure, everything they say about California was true.

I\u2019ve heard they exist but I can\u2019t find anyone who has experience living in one (and I don\u2019t know how many there are/how likely you are to be placed in one as a first year). Any info would be appreciated!",

I\u2019m on the first floor and the ants came in through a hole under the window sill.\n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s not great compared to other places I\u2019ve lived on campus, but if you don\u2019t mind occasionally setting ant traps and particularly want to be in Rains, it\u2019s fine enough I guess. Personally, if this weren\u2019t my last year at Stanford I\u2019d probably move elsewhere. I might\u2019ve just gotten unlucky and don\u2019t really know the chances of drawing into renovated vs unrenovated apartments.",

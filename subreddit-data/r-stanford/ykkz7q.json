    "postText": "Hi, all  \n\n\nI'm a frosh here and want to study some combination of CS and Physics, focusing predominately on CS. I saw the Computational Physics and Data Science track in Physics but it only requires a few CS courses. Is a CS+Physics double major possible? If not, does anyone have other suggestions?   \n\n\nFor reference, I'm currently in Math 51 and CS106B and have credit for Physics 41.",

You might end up having to do a secondary major. I think a more popular option is majoring in physics and coterming in CS so you could look into that as well. Do you know what you are interested in doing long term? I could give more specific advice depending on that.",

            "comment": "I did CS + Physics during undergrad. I ultimately did fine, and was even able to fit in a few things I really wanted (club sport, study abroad) but I probably wouldn\u2019t do it if I went back in time because it required too many sacrifices.\n\nIt was hard to manage courses, and a lot of quarters were just too busy. It was quite frustrating comparing grades between medium and high unit quarters and knowing that lack of time (and sleep) was the main reason for lower grades some quarters. \n\nI also had intended to try research going into Stanford, just in case it might convince me to go to grad school. Since I originally didn\u2019t think I\u2019d go, I kept putting off due to lack of time. However I began to consider it more strongly late in undergrad and wasn\u2019t exactly in a good position. I only ended up starting research my senior year and am doing a coterm to bring myself up to PhD standards.\n\nThings ultimately (hopefully) worked out, and I kind of credit both majors to helping me decide what I want to do my PhD in. However I probably also would\u2019ve had more time to explore had I just done one major and not stretched myself as thin. Probably would\u2019ve had more time to have fun too.\n\nTLDR: it\u2019s doable but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it, especially if you think there\u2019s any chance you might want to go to grad school. I\u2019d recommend physics + some extra cs courses of interest (maybe coterm), or engineering physics",

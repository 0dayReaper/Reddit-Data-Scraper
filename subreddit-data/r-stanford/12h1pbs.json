    "postText": "I felt really comfortable with the vibe of Synergy during Co-Op Crawl. I'm just worried it's too competitive, and I'd much rather get a non-Synergy row house than no row house at all. Which houses are competitive, and which ones are easier to get into? And how can I give myself a better chance of getting into the row houses I want? Thanks in advance :))",

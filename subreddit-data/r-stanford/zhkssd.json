Also make sure to get a great lock. Bike theft here is no joke",

Consider whether you would lock it outside while in class or whether it is small enough when folded to carry with you and put under your chair.",

They\u2019re easier to ride, waterproof (I didn\u2019t know my scooter wasn\u2019t but now the headlight won\u2019t turn off) and you won\u2019t have to charge them every 2 nights. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong I love my scooter as it\u2019s faster, super fun and takes no effort but a bike is better all around",

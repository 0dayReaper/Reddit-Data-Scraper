All the trite and generic advice that we\u2019ve been hearing since middle school.  I can appreciate that these are sometimes circumstances that lead people to self harm however, in this case to just reduce Katie to someone who couldn\u2019t hack it at Stanford is disrespectful and borderline dishonest. There was nothing said about the fact that she was threatened by admin and potentially facing sanction for breaking HC. \nI didn\u2019t expect her death to bother/affect me as much as it did but it does.",

I agree that many instructors/TAs overreact.\n\nProblems arise, however, when students deny that they cheated (sometimes legitimately, but many times as an attempt to get out of the penalty). You don't want the instructor (and certainly not the TAs) to be able to unilaterally penalize someone for cheating if they didn't actually cheat. So, this leads to judicial hearings, which can be productive, but are also a waste of time when the student did actually cheat (and it is obvious).",

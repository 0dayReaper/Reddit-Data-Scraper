I took it without any frontend experience - I think the projects are a great way to get your feet wet with full stack / front end. \n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard bad thing about the tests - remember that they are ridiculously curved. For instance, I think the class average on exams was 50-60 when I took it, but they were curved such that the median score became an A.",

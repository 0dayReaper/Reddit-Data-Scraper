You must be a head honcho in the union, right?  Let me ask you a question, \u201cguy.\u201d  How far do you commute from your house to your massively well paying Stanford job?  More than 30 minutes?  More than 2 hours one way?  Let me ask you another question, \u201cguy.\u201d  Do you receive benefits with your massively compensated Stanford salary?  Did you know that other company\u2019s have better benefits packages?   Final question, \u201cguy.\u201d  Does your manager take advantage of your toil and sweat to further his own career?\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about money, you spoon fed 1%er.  This is about a work-life balance for the people on campus who do the most work.  You say you\u2019re a worker and you\u2019re not exploited?  Maybe try to talk to some of your co-workers.  Or come down out of your ivory tower and humble yourself enough to talk with people who are doing the grunt work you probably put your nose up to.\n\nJust stop arguing.  You have no defense.",

How can you be so vitriolic to someone who began this with \"this is a genuine question:\"\n\nI'm part of the workforce here. I definitely don't have any ownership, and my work returns more to the university than I am compensated - if not, I'd be fired just like anyone else in any other at-will job. So, while you've prejudged me, don't know anything about me or my circumstances here other than I work at Stanford in some capacity, the question isn't and wasn't about me. \n\nIf you mind stop insulting me, maybe take a crack at what I first asked. What is different in Stanford's circumstances than with any other for-profit company? \n\nMaybe it's nothing, and that's fine, it doesn't invalidate the argument at all.

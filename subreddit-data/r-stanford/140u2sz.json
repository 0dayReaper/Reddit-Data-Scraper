    "postText": "I\u2019m going to be an incoming junior transfer in the fall, and I\u2019m trying to complete the Psych major in two years. Is this too time-consuming of a courseload for my first quarter? FYI I would be trying to establish myself socially as a junior and find a circle of friends while taking these four classes:\n\n1. Intro to Psych \n2. Psych 10: Intro to Statistical Methods in Psych (kinda worried abt this class since I haven\u2019t taken a math class in four years and am generally bad at math) \n3. Psych 60: Intro to Developmental Psych \n4. Art Studies 152: Soft Sculpture \n\n\nI\u2019d also be working as an RA at a Psych lab during my first quarter. Is this too much? Thanks!",

            "comment": "I think transfers receive random roommates. Echoing the other comments, all transfers live in Kimball unless they are non-traditional. Kimball is an upperclass dorm where about 15% of the population is new transfers but many transfers keep living there as well. They have some transfer-specific events but are also a regular dorm. Something to note is that if you have an accommodation for single housing (no roommates) then you should set up your documentation etc asap because if you wait until close to the school year starting you may have to wait for housing that fits the accommodation and have to move during the year.",

Hope you spend some wonderful 4 years there :)\r  \n\r  \nI applied as an international transfer student from Greece, but unfortunately wasn't lucky enough this time :(\r  \n\r  \nI would love to discuss with you, if you don't have an issue with that, how you approached the application process, and learn more about how you presented your competitive personal advantage, in order to make myself a better candidate the next time!\r  \n\r  \nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!",

    "postText": "Hello! I am currently down to the final hours till college decision day, and I was hoping if anyone could help me in this decision. I am interested in engineering, although undecided field. I am aware academics are very similar so I was hoping for help in other aspects of life, like social environment. One of my main concerns is the dorm life at stanford. I have heard that some of the dorms are not the nicest and that stanford suffers from a lack of community at times with the neighborhood system. Additionally, I have heard concerns about administration. I hope this post does not come off as pretentious as I would appreciate any guidance, whether pros or cons.",

Also, after talking to many students that got accepted to both Stanford and Princeton, the consensus seems to be that Stanford\u2019s social environment is more chill while Princeton\u2019s is relatively pretentious. It\u2019s up to you though.",

A lot of people bash the 6 majors and no double majors, but each of the engineering majors sans computer science have circa 10 tracks, so you can really specialize. Ok, nothing like SymSys, but the SymSys kids at Stanford are looked down on anyways\u2026. Anyone who says Princeton\u2019s social environment is more pretentious was just socially awkward, it\u2019s a big enough school that saying there\u2019s a single defining social environment is bogus. You will find great groups of people who you connect with anywhere. And I do love the Princeton res college system, they definitely foster community. This is from a Princeton student, girlfriend goes to Stanford so we\u2019ve talked a lot about these things.",

            "comment": "Princeton is a top notch school, but my belief is that engineering is a better discipline at Stanford.  You can't possibly go wrong with this decision, though.\n\nPerhaps a deciding factor could be the environment.  Princeton is going to have four seasons including a true winter, whereas Stanford will have two, \"rainy/cool\" and \"warm\".  If you do or don't want snow &amp; freezing temperatures to be part of your reality for 3+ months, that might help inform your decision.  Stanford has quite a lot of nice public areas set aside for nature, but they definitely have a curated feel to it (think: paved paths through the foothills or along the bay), whereas Princeton is relatively close to true wilderness.  Stanford is in a much more suburban area than Princeton, with all the benefits and drawbacks of that kind of environment: getting to San Fran will feel a lot more attainable than getting to NYC, if you even need to go that far to find what you're looking for.\n\nI grew up relatively close to Princeton, and went to Stanford (and currently live near there), so hopefully this is a reasonable &amp; optimistic summary of what it's like to live in both areas.",

Especially if you\u2019re unsure of the sub-discipline, you\u2019ll have enormous access to interesting courses and research, and all kinds of chances to apply them in an applied environment, plus a huge depth of courses to draw on from other fields and explore. Socially, my advice would just be to join student clubs and engage in research rather than meeting friends through dorm life. You can build great friendships that way with shared interests and it\u2019s a lot more reliable than meeting incidentally through housing/dorms, which are fine but hit or miss. As far as broader quality of life, Stanford is gorgeous and you can enjoy studying outside or enjoying fresh air to clear your mind, grab fresh produce at the farmers markets, or hang out with friends just about year-round, which really helps when you\u2019re inevitably involved in all the stress of college life. It\u2019s an experience you won\u2019t ever forget. A tradeoff for being in the center of the world for VC is that it\u2019s a quiet suburban setting full of wealthy families, but you\u2019ll have no end to interesting academic opportunities on campus (in all kinds of fields), and if you get off of campus there\u2019s plenty of nature and more active areas with all kinds of great food to explore\u2014personally I like the quiet setting, but if something more bustling is that\u2019s what you\u2019re into, it isn\u2019t hard to find, just be prepared to take the train (maybe 30 min) versus a more relaxed suburban vibe. That said, you\u2019re here for 4 years and you\u2019ll have far more than 4 years of things to do. All things considered, I\u2019d highly recommend Stanford, especially given your engineering interests (and probably for most interests in STEM), as the depth at Stanford is so much stronger in most of those fields, but congratulations either way on having two fantastic choices\u2014honestly either one will set you up with a great experience though and options for whatever you decide to do ahead. Best of luck, whatever you decide!",

Way better than somewhere like New Haven but not a big city vibe if that\u2019s what you want. Definitely tons of cool places to explore off campus if you want to, though in practice most students probably don\u2019t get to half of them while they\u2019re here\u2014you will have plenty to do with classes, so in practice you\u2019ll probably end up spending more time on campus unless that\u2019s really your focus. Campus is beautiful though, and it\u2019s honestly a really idyllic place to get to be",

            "comment": "You can\u2019t go wrong either way but each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Congratulations on such wonderful choices! Some good news for you is that science and engineering at either school is top notch.\n\nThis sub was recommended to me, so don\u2019t hate on me for not being from here lmao.\n\nTo preface this, I just committed to my PhD at Princeton for an engineering discipline over Caltech and MIT. I have a friend who chose Princeton over Stanford for their PhD, and another who chose Stanford over Princeton. All this to say; engineering at all of these schools is great, and you\u2019ll find a similar group of motivated individuals at each of them. Of course, PhD selection is more advisor focused, so that is a bit different than undergrad.\n\nThe consensus is generally that Princeton\u2019s engineering departments are more theoretical, coming out of eng at Princeton you\u2019ll be an \u201capplied scientist\u201d more than an engineer. Princeton is *very* good at its niche\u2014academic/research science. This is a common thread among east coast schools, most of their famous engineers are actually closer to scientists. (e.g. Gibbs was an engineering PhD at Yale, first in the US!) \n\nStanford excels at more practical engineering/business oriented stuff. Part of this is due to its proximity to Silicon Valley and the influence of the start-up-focused tech scene.\n\nFinally, don\u2019t listen to people saying the social scene at Princeton is \u201cpretentious.\u201d It\u2019s no less pretentious than the one at Stanford. Some of the most pretentious people I\u2019ve met in the last year have been \u201ctech bros\u201d from Stanford. Ultimately, the social scene at any school you go to will be what you make of it. \n\nIn terms of location, Princeton is in an NYC/Philly Ex-urb, Stanford is in a SF Ex-urb. You have public transit through the pton junction at Princeton\u2014I\u2019m not sure ab stanford but I\u2019m sure something similar exists. \n\nIf you want to go down the research/theory route, I\u2019d heavily recommend Princeton. However, if your goal is to be a engineer instead of a scientist, Stanford is your best bet. It comes down to what you want, but you can\u2019t make a wrong choice! \n\nI highly recommend reaching out to the r/princeton sub, since everyone believes their respective school is \u201cthe best.\u201d It\u2019s good to get opinions from everyone to sus out the \u201cvibe\u201d of each place. Notice that in this sub there are a lot of people fighting over being \u201cbetter,\u201d my guess is you\u2019ll find a more balanced group of people at Princeton. \n\nGood luck with your choice OP.",

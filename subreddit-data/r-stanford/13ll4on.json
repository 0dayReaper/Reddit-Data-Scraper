Family of 3 and probably we will be 4 then. The Stanford housing pages are confusing. Any special recommendations? I would like to be close to the hospital due to work.",

There\u2019s families and everything is locked so your kids won\u2019t wander into the pool area without a keycard.",

But you can call housing and see if you qualify for graduate housing which would have furnished apartments. They have family graduate housing which would be nice for your wife as there are lots of young families.",

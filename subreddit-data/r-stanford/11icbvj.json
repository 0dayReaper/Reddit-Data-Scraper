    "postText": "I was recently accepted into Stanford for an Env Eng MS and was looking into graduate couples housing. I really don\u2019t want to comute from an off campus apartment and was looking into the on campus couples housing. Does anyone have experience with the graduate couples housing? We\u2019re currently in a ~700 sq ft one bedroom and the ~450 sq ft one bedrooms available on campus seem like they\u2019ll be a bit tight. Any info would be appreciated !",

That\u2019s about as spacious as it gets unfortunately.\n\nMunger is centrally located and about as close as you\u2019ll be able to get to Y2E2 / the engineering quad where I\u2019m guessing a bulk of your time will be spent.",

I try to be grateful because a lot of our friends not in relationships got assigned housing either off campus or super far from their classes/office space\n\nFeel free to msg me if you have questions tho!",

            "comment": "Stanford just purchased a big apartment complex on Sand Hill Road, very near to campus. (Formerly the apartment complex was known as Oak Creek). Priority will be given to post-docs but they will also accept coupled grad students if space allows. If you can afford it, this would be very close to where you need to be and the units are spacious. Probably pricey but I have not seen the rates:\n\nhttps://news.stanford.edu/report/2022/09/20/stanford-adds-housing-near-campus/",

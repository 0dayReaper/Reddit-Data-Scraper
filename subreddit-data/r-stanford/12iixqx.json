            "comment": "Far better than comparable schools. Graduate student housing (most live on campus) is clustered together and packed with social spaces used to hold frequent events, many if not most of which are recurring. Departments hold more social events (e.g. weekly socials with alcohol) for grads than for undergrads, who don't have nearly as many opportunities to socialize with peers sharing their specific interests. Many international student organizations have regular dinners and such. Plenty of off-campus stuff too.\n\nhttps://news.stanford.edu/report/2021/12/08/programs-people-encourage-graduate-life-outside-classrooms-labs/",

We had 6-7 official events per year and more unofficial events we organized ourselves. The department also hosted events 2-3 times a quarter so we got to know others that way. Every Friday we were invited to eat lunch in our building. Our classes were small, so we got to know people (both in and out of our focus) there as well. \n\nOverall, there were more events than I had time to attend. Lots of opportunity to meet people. You\u2019ll definitely need to put in some work to construct your own circle, but the community is there to interact with.",

            "comment": "community for grad students is program dependent, and can often be department dependent at the PhD level. i would say stanford's community is on average better than the average at similar schools, largely due to the giant student housing complex they have. its super nice and they have parking out front. \n\nfrom there, you gotta check in with your department and see how it is. usually it's size dependent too, like a department that has a cohort of 5-10 students is probably not gonna be good, but a cohort of 100 students is bound to not be tight knit. usually 20-30 is a good number per cohort. also depends on how the department is situated in the larger university. a lot of the \"community\" will be research related, so if your department has affiliations with other departments, then there's larger community and events to tap into (for example if you're involved in robotics im sure the CS people and the aero/astro people collab and have joint events)",

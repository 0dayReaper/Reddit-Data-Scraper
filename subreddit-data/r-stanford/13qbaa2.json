    "postText": "Im a pre freshman interested in finance, and was wondering whether there was a sub section of students who help one another learn about the field of finance and help with interview prep, etc. \n\nI\u2019m just worried that if I want to do finance from Stanford, I\u2019ll have to do a lot of cold emailing and self-prep for interviews, whereas other schools have upperclassmen to help. Any insight would be super helpful - thank you!",

There\u2019s also at least 5 clubs/organizations I can think of off the top of my head (Blythe fund, kudla fund, Stanford finance, business frats, women-targeted clubs, etc) and a bunch of finance classes plus people do GSB classes. So tl;dr there\u2019s a bunch of opportunities and I don\u2019t think people from Stanford have any more trouble recruiting than their east coast counterparts. \n\nAs for cutthroat vs. helpful, I feel like probably helpful as long as it helps more than hurts, but ultimately trying to serve your own interests. This is corporate America, after all.",

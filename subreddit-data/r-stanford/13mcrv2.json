    "postText": "Hello there everyone!\n\nI was recently accepted to Stanford as a transfer and I have some questions about the premed coursework. I have the physics sequence and biochemistry left to take and I was wondering how the professors are for those classes? Somebody told me about the \u201chorror stories\u201d of Stanford physics classes but I didn\u2019t want to really believe anything unless I heard from actual Stanford students/alumni. I\u2019d appreciate any information on this. I\u2019m very excited :)",

Hope you spend some wonderful years there :)\r  \n\r  \nI applied as an international transfer student from Greece, but unfortunately wasn't lucky enough this time :(\r  \n\r  \nI would love to discuss with you, if you don't have an issue with that, how you approached the application process, and learn more about how you presented your competitive personal advantage, in order to make myself a better candidate the next time!\r  \n\r  \nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!",

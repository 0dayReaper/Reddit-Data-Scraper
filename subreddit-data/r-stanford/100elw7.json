    "postText": "I'm graduating this year and I have a fear of physically graduating alone. I guess I'm just really anxious about it and am not sure if I'm the only one in this position or if anyone else out there feels the way I do. \n\nI took several reduced course loads during COVID, failed a ton of classes, got in trouble with the school, and took a leave of absence. It only delayed graduation by a year but all of my close friends have already graduated and left campus or they're on a much longer leave and won't be walking this year. I'm not in greek life, I didn't keep up with any clubs, and don't really hang out with anyone who is walking this year. I'm also not living in undergrad housing which makes it hard to hang out with new people especially since I'm not very sociable anymore and have been spending a lot of time trying to stay on track to graduate and not delay it anymore. \n\nWhen I stopped drinking and partying, I lost a huge outlet on being able to make new friends and keep up with old ones. There really wasn't much we did together that didn't involve alcohol. I have a few people I hang out with regularly and am content with how much more introverted I've become, but everyone is much older or in different programs (mba, etc).\n\nEver since I was a freshman, everyone always hyped up graduation, senior events, and the wacky walk. I skipped out on the senior events for my original class since I again just didn't feel comfortable with drinking and the pressure that came from my old friend group. But when it comes to the actual graduation day, I can't miss out on it and it's a huge moment for me and my family (especially since I'm the first to graduate college out of my entire extended family). I always pictured myself being able to do the wacky walk, be surrounded by friends, meet up with family at the end to take pictures and introduce them to my friends, and we all get dinner at the end. It all just seems like a fantasy to me since I know I'm going to be alone that day and my parents are going to ask where any of my friends are only to realize there really isn't anyone.\n\nMaybe it's just my anxiety getting to me or I'm just being entitled or selfish or even a loner. This seriously gives me anxiety and scares me a lot. Will I really be alone on graduation day? We're all together as a class but everyone also has their own groups. Am I just being paranoid and anxious? Or does anyone else feel/felt the same way and have any advice?",

            "comment": "Graduation was difficult for me - in addition to stress about next steps (no job secured) and some friendship drama, I did not have a friend group to do wacky walk with or even sit with.\n\nHowever, graduation from my department was more meaningful than the entire class's ceremony, as that's when you get the diploma and walk across the stage. No wacky walk costumes at that time. Ultimately, I found that graduation was more meaningful for my family, who supported me through college. I texted them during the ceremonies and we went out for dinner after.\n\nETA - good for you for making some tough choices, and congrats on making it through!",

Show up maybe 20 to 30 minutes late and you\u2019ll be at the back of the line, where you\u2019ll find grads in small groups or alone. Very peaceful. Might even bump into people from your year. I say definitely go and enjoy! Congratulations! You deserve this moment. You\u2019ve done a great job.",

            "comment": "Graduation was definitely anticlimactic for me, and kind of a mixed bag. After the main ceremony, everyone joins their families and heads to their department ceremonies. \n\nIt was all very subdued and quiet. I wouldn\u2019t worry about being alone for the main ceremony. It\u2019s hard to make out individuals from the stands and the focus will turn to the commencement speakers. Just take it all in and remember the day. Some parts will turn into a blur, but hopefully you have a memorable commencement speaker. \n\nDon\u2019t stress about it.",

            "comment": "I felt a similar anxiety about my graduation but I\u2019d say the whole ceremony was pretty underwhelming. It is perfectly normal to show up without friends and without a wacky walk costume.\n\nRemember, you have to line up for the ceremony at some ungodly hour like 8am. A lot of people are going to be out of it and just chillin. Of course the Stanford media/resources make it look like everyone has elaborate costumes and shows up with friends, but that\u2019s honestly probably less than half of the students.\n\nThe reality is that you\u2019ll wait in line for while, grab your free water bottle, sit in the hot sun for a bunch of speeches, and then meet up with your family afterwards. I happened to run into a friend in line, but we basically just sat together during the speeches and then dipped.\n\nIf you\u2019re not dying to show up with a specific group of friends, then I think it would be perfectly normal to show up on your own and without a costume. As cliche as it sounds, the journey is really more important\u2014quitting drinking, getting your grades back on track, making new friends. The graduation ceremony is a formality tacked on at the end largely to cater to parents. You got what you needed out of Stanford, so I\u2019d say just be comfortable in your own skin and enjoy the ceremony. Congrats!",

I barely remember the stadium and mostly remember the department ceremony and hanging out with my parents there. I think your situation is probably a lot more common than you think. I don't think your family will care if you don't have a lot of friends there. They are there for you. Take time to hang out with them as much as possible and celebrate your great accomplishment!",

            "comment": "Can you ask any of your close friends to come celebrate your graduation? Not the main ceremonies, but maybe invite them to have dinner with you and your family afterwards. \n\nFor my graduation, I didn\u2019t have any \u201csquad\u201d or close friends either, but really wanted to do wacky walk. I asked two seniors from one of my clubs to do it with me (it was very last minute). Even though we weren\u2019t close friends we still had a lot of fun making our costumes, getting into the line early and seeing everyone dressed up. You just gotta ask around with the people you do know who are graduating. \n\nIt definitely felt awkward after the department ceremony, when everyone\u2019s hugging and taking photos together and meeting each others families. But you can leave at any point. Maybe tell your family you want to take photos at the Quad, or you want to show them around campus, etc. to get out of it early.",

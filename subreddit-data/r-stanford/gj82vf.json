To me, a college town exists where the culture of the town and the university are interwoven. Ignoring the obvious significance of tech for both Stanford and Palo Alto, I feel like there's virtually no cultural connection between Stanford and Palo Alto.\n\nI think there are a few reasons for this, leading among them being the widespread use of on-campus housing. Unlike other towns where college students may make up a notable segment of the population, this is not at all the case in Palo Alto. This is partially due to the high cost of living but also the layout of the university (i.e., the large amount of open space that separates the heart of campus from Palo Alto).",

There's no college nightlife to speak of because nearly all Stanford students (including grad and PhD students) live on campus and just hang out in their little residential areas. The donut place in Mountainview is the only place for miles that has late night service. I often wonder how long it will be before Stanford's location becomes a  liability and begins impacting its ranking and ability to attract faculty and students (particularly grad students who have to live in a fixed income).",

    "postText": "Hi I am a summer visiting students and I want to take CS 229 Machine Learning. I see that \"Summer quarter enrollment is limited. Priority given to Stanford students.\" I wonder does visiting students usually manage to enroll into CS 229 (in the past few summers).\n\nBecause I gotta pay a hell lot of fees (\\~800 USD) before I could register for courses, so I do not want to pay the fees and then not getting into the course I want.",

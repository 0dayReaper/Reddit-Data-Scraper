    "postText": "1. I want to purse an Economics + CS double major for my bachelors and then use my CS credits to also get a Masters. This is because CS-BS and CS-MS share 50% of the requirements and I was wondering if I can double count CS-BS requirements for CS-MS.\n\ntldr: Is is possible to get a CS-BS, ECON-BA, and CS-MS (and I hope to double count classes from my BS in my MS)\n\n2. I was also looking into the MS&amp;E major and many of the engineering requirements are the same (MATH51, ENGR108, etc.) Can I double count those classes because most of them are really repetitive?",

So if I hope to convert my CS-BS to a MS then will I only be awarded a MS degree (isn't it just easier for me to just get an MS?)\n2. What is an easier major Econ or MS&amp;E?\n3. CS &amp; MS&amp;E have the same core class requirements (because they are both in the engineering department) will I have to double take these classes if I want to do CS+MS&amp;E?",

IMO MS&amp;E\n3. https://advising.stanford.edu/current-students/advising-student-handbook/double-secondary-dual \n  for more specific advice, talk to an academic advisor or major-specific advisor (like the CS Course Advisor) once you are matriculated and enrolled, so next fall assuming you are a pre-frosh.\n\nin general tho, I don't think you can double-count major requirements.",

    "postText": "Any postdocs out there applied for oak creek recently? \n\nStanford bought over oak creek apartments and I am looking to rent a 2b2b since it's way cheaper than my current apartment. \n\nIt seems like there is priority for postdocs. Are the apartments any good? I am worried that they might be too old. \n\nAnd how long did you have to wait or are you still waiting?",

My unit was solid for what it was though (3rd floor), and units had heaters in most rooms and AC in the living room. Never needed heating with heat coming from blow; AC came in handy during heat wave weeks in the summer. Amenities are solid (heated pool, dry sauna, heat room, tennis courts, grills, clubhouse).\n\nI have heard that come recent postdocs suffering from intense roach infestations at Oak Creek, and I'm not surprised. I think R&amp;DE fully did not help them out, which I guess is not unexpected.",

The buildings are old but based on what I've seen in the area so are most of the affordable apartments. And the amenities are pretty great: hot tub, multiple pools, gym. And I rarely heard my neighbors which I can't say about my current apartment.",

In my experience most 'business' programs are post-grad MBAs, so you get the undergrad first, work a few years, then apply to business school. Having said that, Stanford does offer something similar to what you want as a major, management science and engineering ( [https://majors.stanford.edu/majors/management-science-and-engineering](https://majors.stanford.edu/majors/management-science-and-engineering) ) \n\nBut there are plenty of undergraduate degrees that would be useful for business, depending on your interests: [https://majors.stanford.edu/majors](https://majors.stanford.edu/majors)\n\nCommunication, economics, civil and environmental engineering,  energy resources engineering, ethics in society, product design, and statistics would all be helpful.\n\nIf you're considering turning down an offer from Stanford because there is no explicit business major, I'd urge you against that choice.",

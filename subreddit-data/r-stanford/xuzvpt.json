Now I\u2019m in the position of needing to hire childcare help (a few hours a few days a week max) that an energetic and fun student could totally do (and my kids would love). Any ideas as to how best to get the word out? (We are local)",

Ideally need help picking them up from school between ~4 and 4:45pm (so need car and clean driving record), then bring home and hang l, play with puppy, maybe get dinner for them started. Frequency is a little up in the air at the moment possibly 2 or three days a week every other week or every week depending on some variables (including the sitter\u2019s schedule).",

I just finished bedtime for the kids and saw these responses \u2014 apparently should have just posted an ad here initially instead!\n\nWe are in Redwood City (about 6 miles from campus). The gremlins are 4 and 7.5 and lots of fun (I\u2019m biased tho). Looking mainly for after school hours (4-6:30 or so). Must like puppies! (We have one)\n\nDM me for more details.",

    "postText": "Hello Stanford students and alumni! I and a few other students are thinking of creating an unofficial, student-created dorm review platform to help ease the stress of navigating the housing options at Stanford. We're hoping this will be an easy way for you to rate the dorms you've lived in, and then see other student ratings to choose where you'd like to live. But we need your help to prototype this concept!\n\n[Leave your review here](https://forms.gle/hRszw1N8AMsCFnxG8) (you'll need a Stanford account to access this form)\n\nProFros and rising sophomores, please like this post if you think Stanford Dorm Reviews would be helpful :) or comment below with your questions/concerns about housing at Stanford!",

Arrillaga was also \"new\" back then.",

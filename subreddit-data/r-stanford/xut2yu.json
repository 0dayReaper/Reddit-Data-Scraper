I am a visiting scholar at the Department of English, and I'd like to connect with new people to grab a coffee, study together at the library or just navigate campus.\n\nI am doing a PhD in Germany and I'll stay on campus for 9 months, so as an outsider - it's always good to create new social connections. I am gonna try to use Reddit for that. Write me!",

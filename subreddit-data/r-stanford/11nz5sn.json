Just got an email yesterday from the CS admin looking for \"buddies\" to pair current students with admitted ones.\n\nThe email stated, \"Applicants to the Master's program will be notified of their admissions status by third week of March.\"\n\nThe deadline to get back to the admin to become a \"buddy\" is next Wed, so that would be the very earliest they would release decisions. As another commentator here said, it seems likely they will release it by next Friday (March 17).",

    "postText": "Incoming frosh hoping to major in math or MCS and interested in possibly coterming later down the road in something like CS or math&amp;comp engineering. \n\nI have a pretty solid math background which is why Im wanting to opt for the 60s series instead of 50s. Ive taken multi (but not linear)  and have some proof writing experience, but not extensively. So, while Im excited about the 60s series, Im still prepared for it to be challenging and recognize Im not starting out at the level of IMO medalists or other math geniuses. \n\nAdvice on difference in difficulty of 61 CM vs 61 DM? Im also way more interested in more applied mathematics but Ive heard both CM and DM are fairly theoretical so not sure if it makes a big difference.",

I think for people who haven\u2019t seen real analysis 61cm can sometimes be harder, but both both classes are similar in a lot of ways and both cover linear algebra. If you are interested in maybe doing a physical science or more analysis classes for the math major, I say 61cm is the more common choice. 61DM is also valid and does more discrete math/ no real analysis and so is a more common choice for people interested in CS/discrete math/ not analysis. You cal also switch into 62/63dm from cm but not the other way around\n\nAlso for more specific info if you Google \u201cmath department peer advising stanford\u201d you can email the peer advisors and they can help",

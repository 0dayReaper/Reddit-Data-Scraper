    "postText": "Like, wtf is going on. I understand bombing down the road in the bike lane....cause it's a bike lane. But when you transition from the road to campus sidewalks,  it necessitates that you slow down and give walkers the right of way. I've been on campus for all of two weeks and have had bikers come flying out of nowhere and slam on their brakes (usually by the small hill leading down from the law school towards coupa), then get pissy with me and shake their head or mutter \"what to fuck.\" IT'S A GOD DAMN SIDEWALK, IF YOU'RE GOING TO BOMB THROUGH HERE, PEDESTRIANS ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO REACT. Has anyone had this experience? What's the etiquette here, I'm new. So far the etiquette seems to be f%$ you, buy a bike or get out of the way.",

Bikers will lose those fights 10 out of 10 times. I've also witnessed lots of biker to biker fuckups.\n\nLast week, while biking in the roundabout in front of EVGR B, another biker cut me off as I tried to exit the circle. As a result, I almost got hit by a car. If you're going to be an asshole to other bikers, at least do it in places that don't have cars.\n\nHere's my particular gripes with my fellow bikers so far:\n\n* If you are in the road, you must **behave as if you are a car.** That means stopping at lights/signs, signaling when turning/merging, and not weaving in between stopped traffic\u2014 wait in the line of cars like everyone else. If you are in a bike line, do not exit the bike lane without checking behind you and signaling with your arm that you wish to merge into the main road.\n* Wear! a! helmet! around! cars!\n\n# You are paying Stanford too much money to get a TBI because you were biking without a helmet.",

At Stanford, treat anything that isn't paved in segmented 4 foot squares with a curb as a road.\n\nAlso ya first few weeks are always rough before people (bikers, skaters, pedestrians included) figure out how to be on the look out for others at all times and gauge their projected motion properly. I probably crashed twice per quarter freshman year and maybe twice the rest of undergrad and grad school combined. You've effectively got double the freshmen this year counting sophomores.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;buy a bike or get out of the way\n\ngenerally, yes",

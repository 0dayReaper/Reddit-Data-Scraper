    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm an incoming first year master's student in Mech E and was looking to fill my housing application with someone for the upcoming year. \n\nHere are some of my preferences:\n1. I often sleep by 12 or 1 am and wake up by 8 or 9 am. \n\n2. I'm generally quiet except I'm a musician and like to practice singing when noone is at home or in the shower (would love to share a space with a fellow musician!) \n\n3. I only cook vegetarian at home but I do eat chicken and seafood regularly from outside\n\n4. I do not smoke/vape at all and try to keep drinking alcohol to a minimum. \n\nIf anyone is looking for roommates and matches the preferences above, please PM me! Thank you.",

We were also taught that \u201cLatine\u201d is a better substitute for \u201cLatinx\u201d as it stays truer to the original language, but when talking about a group of people, \u201cLatinos\u201d was the most common term. \n\nGranted, I am a white person who hasn\u2019t used Spanish in several years, but those are just my observations from a classroom setting as well as anecdotes from friends!",

No. And I'm a little worried by the rhetoric used by IT HR around erasure and prescription of language. A dictionary should be a record of language used and not a ground truth on what language is allowed.\n\nBut this list isn't a dictionary and we shouldn't treat it as such. It's an internal guide for those writing \"as Stanford\" making recommendations about how Stanford should present itself publicly. You might not agree with every one of these recommendations (I don't), but they're recommendations and not requirements. And some of the suggestions are actually compelling. \n\nI design software systems and have struggled a bit with naming conventions where structures like master/slave are ubiquitous. Do I really want to use and propagate that language if I'm in a position to change it? Primary/secondary is actually a good suggestion in this case and not one I'd considered before. But will I stop using the term blackbox? Definitely not in my personal speech and probably not in my professional speech. I think they've over-racialized the term here. \n\nThe takeaway here should be that it's important to be intentional about the language we use because language is important. We each can choose how we express ourselves via language and thinking critically about the effects of our language is a positive thing.",

No one, and certainly no one outside the IT department, is being penalized for using phrases that fall in it.\n\nI don't think it's too far fetched to suppose that the list was created by some Stanford IT employee assigned to make it as a punishment, to make up for allegations of offensive speech. Take a look at some of the entries on the list. They cannot have been made in good faith.\n\nI'm seriously surprised at the masses of people, even at Stanford, engaging with the list as if it's a genuine representation of how \"Stanford\" as an institution wants us to talk. Basic skepticism tells me this is the work of either a deliberate saboteur unhappy with having been assigned the job or someone who just doesn't care enough and wrote whatever they could to meet a numbers requirement.

There's no way they were genuinely, seriously trying to help when sending in some of those suggestions. They read like a parody because they *were* a parody, which higher-ups apparently either missed or just didn't care enough about to backpedal on. (Their mistake, but I can see why reviewing such a low-stakes project would be a non-priority for them)",

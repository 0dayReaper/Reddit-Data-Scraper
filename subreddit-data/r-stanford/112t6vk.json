    "postText": "Thoughts on missing school for a few days in the middle of the quarter, specifically Thursday-Monday? \n\nNormally I\u2019d rather not miss school, but was offered a chance to go visit some members of my extended family that I normally don\u2019t see otherwise. Problem is this is in the middle of next quarter so idk yet my class\u2019 attendance policy or when the exams are. Would it be worth risking it to go?",

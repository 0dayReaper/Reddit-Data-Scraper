    "postText": "My friend was accepted to Stanford for undergrad. They're considering not going because, in paraphrasing their words, they are a 5'6\" short nerdy asian that is very shy at first and takes a while to open up. They're worried about the dorm culture at Stanford. \n\nI went to MIT for undergrad and we have a really tight knit dorm culture, where everyone in each dorm is a part of a great community. There's not really any sort of popularity associated with being extroverted or attractive, and truly anyone can easily fit in. \n\nHe's worried that he might end up being a person with very few friends at Stanford, and is considering going to different school because of this. Could someone tell me what the dorm culture is like at Stanford? On the surface, it seems like to easily make friends at Stanford you have to have one of the following: be outgoing, play a sport, be attractive, have a top 1% likable personality. I'm not sure how well a \"5'6\" short nerdy asian\" (his words) with low social skills would fit in. \n\nI personality think the most important part about undergrad is the sense of community you have and the friends you make (a close second is learning as much as you can and making use of the opportunities, but you're not gonna be able to do this as well if you're depressed because you don't fit in). I worry he won't fit in with the possible lack of MIT-like dorm culture.",

I spent way too much time on academics the first two quarters here and took a massive L on social life, but things turned around in spring quarter of frosh spring. I don't have a huge friend group but don't have trouble finding companion when I want to at all. I'm not very close to the dorm community but did meet some of my good friends in dorm because of proximity. I met most of the rest of my friends through social media and mutual friends.",

            "comment": "Lmao I used to describe myself in that way in high school, down to even the 5\u20196 part. I overcame a lot of my socially-stifling introversion and shyness in college, but it had nothing to do with Stanford\u2019s \u201cdorm culture.\u201d Your friend will have difficulties making friends anywhere if he isn\u2019t willing to put in the effort. I put in the effort when I came to Stanford because I was determined to not repeat another 4 years of isolation that I had experienced in high school. First week in I was pretending to be confident in myself and initiated conversations with strangers, which I never did in high school. It was nerve-wracking but I faked it long enough for it to be real and now I feel pretty comfortable with social settings. My college were quite surprised for me to characterize myself as shy.\n\nAnyways, being attractive and outgoing or playing sports helps you make friends anywhere obviously, not just at Stanford. And like anywhere else, he will find people who will be friends with him even if he is a \u201c5\u20196 short nerdy Asian\u201d (there\u2019s many of them here at Stanford) if he actually puts in effort into forming and maintaining relationships with people.\n\nI am a junior so I didn\u2019t have a freshman year on campus, but from what I see freshman dorms are very social and people make a lot of friends in there that will last throughout college. Also, there are co-ops, which I have been living in for 2 years, which are dorms filled with only about 50 people who cook and clean together and I have found my most meaningful and close friendships in those.",

            "comment": "I think he'll be fine. And I'm saying this as someone with no friends and no dorm community who spends most of her days alone. As long as he's not as far gone as me (and it sounds like he isn't since he has a friend who cares enough to even ask this), it should be good.\n\nYou have to remember that 1) Stanford accepts lots of short nerdy Asians and that 2) this is not high school anymore. As far as I know, I'm the only one who hasn't really been able to make friends in my several years here (and that's due to mental illness and not attractiveness/where I fall superficially on a social hierarchy). I'm always stunned at how open people are to others in classes, dorms, etc.. I have never had so many people be so kind to me or treat me as an equal. When I first got on campus, I was surprised that people wanted anything to do with me and were willing to spend time with me. \n\nTLDR; people here are genuinely much more open and less superficial than they are in other schools/high school. As long as he isn't struggling with mental illness/personality disorders/etc. he should be fine. If he is, he should seek help before worrying about dorm culture.",

Stanford (and many top schools now) attracts really analytical people, and a lot of evidence supports this framework. That being said, it\u2019s not only a damaging approach to making friends (in terms of self esteem and outcome), but it also represents a wholly inaccurate and incomplete understanding of what constitutes a friendship. \n\nYes, being outgoing will help you make friends, because you share more and have the opportunity to find commonalities with others. But I\u2019ve also seen PLENTY of examples of introverts who have incredibly close friendships built on a gigantic well of trust and shared experience, which are often deeper friendships than the superficial ones extroverted people tend to make.\n\nYes, being on a sports team means it\u2019ll be easy to be friends with people on your team, but it\u2019s also hard to make friends with people outside of your sports team, which especially sucks if you don\u2019t really want to be best friends with people on your team.\n\nYes, being attractive helps make friends, but it can also make things a lot more complicated.\n\nNo, there is no such thing as a \u201ctop 1% personality\u201d that you either have or don\u2019t have. People like people who are compassionate first and foremost. If you\u2019re nice to people, they\u2019ll be nice back.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about making friends in college, it\u2019s a super valid concern. But I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s college-specific. For some reason our generation is becoming less and less empathetic and more and more closed off. We come up with these odd frameworks for understanding each other and our own supposed incompatibility with one another and then use that to be exclusionary. Unless you\u2019re genuinely not nice, there\u2019s nothing you\u2019re \u201cmissing\u201d in the process of making friends. That that seems to be an increasingly infrequent opinion is sad and something that might take work to overcome, but I think ending the process of classifying yourselves and others like this is a good first step.\n\nSorry if I come off judgmental and for typing this whole rant. I really do understand your point of view, and get that it comes from a good place. I had a lot of anxiety coming into college too.",

            "comment": "Yes, but it\u2019s really how much effort you put in. The Neighborhood System is being heavily criticized by us, but the dorms are relatively really nice. Every weekend we have activities for the students in a certain dorm; for holidays there\u2019s activities and there\u2019s dorm trips to places. For example, Larkin has done a whole-dorm Yosemite Trip; Soto has done a Disney trip. However, a lot of students hang out in their lounges. If you don\u2019t put yourself out there, you\u2019re not going to get a \u201ctight-knit\u201d community, but if you do, you have a really nice community. Like a lot of freshman dorms are moving together into a new dorm next year because of how much they like their communities.",

                    "comment": "I'm sorry to hear that :/ I can definitely relate to what you're saying. I've had several therapists suspect that I was on the spectrum and growing up I always struggled to make friends/be respected or listened to by others. Although I haven't made friends at Stanford in the three years I've been here, I have found that students here are at least marginally more accepting and respectful than those I've encountered elsewhere. I find it interesting that you think Stanford is especially appearance-central compared to other places. In general, I feel as if the students here are less attractive and put less effort into appearances than in other places. For example, I've spent a huge chunk of time around Cal and people there seem more clique-y and closed off. You can predict how someone there will react to you based on their appearance (i.e., how conventially attractive they are), but I can't say the same about Stanford.\n\nThat being said, although I can't corroborate that being socially inept is particularly bad at Stanford compared to other schools, I can agree that being alone or different is especially painful here. At large state schools like Cal there is a wide diversity of personalities. However, to get into a school like Stanford you have to be more cookie-cutter-like. As a result, if you're different it's harder to find other people who are also different. I've always said this and I'll say it again: Stanford is a terrible place to be alone. At other schools being lonely is relatively normal but being lonely here feels like an indiciation of inferiority and loss of life. I haven't met anyone else who is a junior and still has no friends. It's definitely rough out here. I often think that I would feel better about myself if I went to a different school where socially anxious and socially inept people were more common.\n\nalso, if you would like someone to talk to you can PM me!",

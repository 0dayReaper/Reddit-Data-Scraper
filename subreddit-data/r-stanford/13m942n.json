A lot of academia is about stirring the pot and the easiest way to do so is with out of the box ideas. You get tenure if you find strong evidence for it. Academia is broken and we'll never stop getting things like this as long academia is the way it currently is.",

While there are some hacks and less than honest people in every field and most top universities, Stanford is filled with Nobel laureates (22) and scientists who are in the top of their fields.  I would put the take up with some of most legitimate sources for information on the topic.  Imho.\n\nEdit: I assume you have connections given the username.  Why slam Stanford?",

All of his patents + biotech companies are on medicine, study of proteins, diseases, etc. He is a great inventor of things related to medicine and pathology.\n\nThis does not make him an expert in aliens and UFOs. Unfortunately, he has likely fallen victim to the Dunning Kruger effect and Overconfidence bias, where his expertise in one field leads him to be overconfident in other fields where he\u2019s not an expert. Because of his lack of familiarity with the nuances of aliens and UFOs, he also has immense, unwarranted confidence.\n\nExperts straying from their fields is actually hugely problematic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, huge swathes of \u201cexperts\u201d like trained chiropractors made largely false claims about vaccine efficacy when they had no real experience in the field. It led to the spread of a lot of misinformation.\n\nIf a Stanford astrophysics professor came forward and stated with confidence that aliens had arrived on Earth, that would hold considerably more weight than a pathology professor. That\u2019s because the astrophysics professor has spent decades studying in their field, consulting with peers, publishing astrophysics papers, etc. to understand the nuances involved in the topic. This professor has done none of that. It\u2019s an unfortunate reminder that Stanford professors are still human\u2014and often, experts let their ego fuel them to believe that they are experts in everything, rather than just the field they have spent their lives studying.",

History is littered with great discoveries by brilliant people working outside their particular field.

And your forgetting the stigma about this topic.  I\u2019m positive that many agree with him in the fields you mentioned, but it is a fairly well known they don\u2019t speak about it among the public or the press.

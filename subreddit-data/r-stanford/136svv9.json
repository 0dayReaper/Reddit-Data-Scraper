            "comment": "Her refusal to discount tuition during the lockdown will forever tarnish the university's reputation. A tuition discount would have been a compassionate and understanding response to the unique difficulties students were experiencing. By not implementing a tuition discount, Stanford sent a message that the university prioritizes its financial interests over the well-being of its students.\n\nThis misstep will have long-lasting effects on the way people view the university. Prospective students, alumni, and the general public will question the institution's commitment to the welfare of its students, leading to consequences in terms of future enrollment and donations. To mitigate the damage and maintain the university's standing, Stanford will need to demonstrate its commitment to the student community through actions and initiatives that prioritize student needs and address their concerns.",

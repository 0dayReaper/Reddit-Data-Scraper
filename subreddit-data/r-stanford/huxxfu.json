On one hand, doing my undergrad at a much less prestigious university made 80% of the schoolwork a total joke for me, which meant I could enjoy my time there and focus on expanding my horizons outside of class. On the other hand, I missed out on what could have been 4 years of greater academic development, professional networking, and just greater resources overall to achieve my goals. I think the main reason I got into the grad school was because at 18 I was ready to make the most of what my undergrad experience offered. With that in mind, I feel like I may have been ready to take advantage of what Stanford had to offer then too and could have made even more of it. Still, in the end I got exactly what I wanted out of both schools so I don't have any real regrets.",

Obviously it depends on the field, but it's hard to imagine going somewhere appreciably down the list and having *better* research opportunities than at Stanford.\n\nLike, I started doing research with a group the summer after my sophomore year, and a good chunk of my senior year was research hours.

    "postText": "Hi everyone. So, I'm interested in applying to a summer session program (Digital Media and Personalization) but I'm not sure if this is the right thing for me. I'm currently doing my masters in the Netherlands and I thought that it would be a great opportunity, to come over to the US for some international experience, but also because this program is a great fit for me.\n\n\nI am bit worried that I might be \"too old\". We don't have similar programs where I grow up (Greece), so I don't have a picture of the average age. Aside from the education part, I also want to make create some friendships. \n\nAre my worries reasonable?",

    "postText": "Hello! Im a prospective freshman. Im interested in cs + medical. The cs with biocomp track seems fitting for me. Does anyone know how close I\u2019ll be to getting premed course requirements if I do this major and track? I looked online, but have never looked at program sheets and they\u2019re a bit confusing to me.",

            "comment": "Somewhat. You need 2 yrs Chem (includes OChem) with lab, 1 yr bio with lab, 1 yr physics with lab. CS biocomputation track only covers .5 yr of chem, 1 yr bio. You'll need to squeeze in more chem and physics + the labs.\n\nAt least after 1 quarter of Bio Core and Chem31X you'll know whether you have the grit to go for med school :)",

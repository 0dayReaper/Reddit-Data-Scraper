    "postText": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m an incoming Ph.D. student at Stanford, starting this Fall. I will be staying at Stanford campus housing (preferably EVGR). I\u2019m looking for a roommate for junior (2b2b) or premium apartments. \n\nI usually prefer to keep it quiet and peaceful in the apartment, especially during the weekdays. Having said that, I\u2019m an avid foodie, and I love travelling, going to the beaches, and exploring new hiking trails. I\u2019d love to socialise and hangout with my roommate, indoors or outdoors, and also share responsibilities. I\u2019d prefer my roommate to be LGBTQIA+ friendly, and a non-vegetarian. Please DM if you are interested and I\u2019ll be happy to discuss more!",

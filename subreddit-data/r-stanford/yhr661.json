    "postText": "I'm a current freshman and I want to take a leave of absence for the entire year. My physical and mental health has deteriorated to a state where I find it very difficult that I can complete this quarter, not just in good standing, but in any standing. I'm talking to my UAD with my parents about this tomorrow. The problem is that \"Under rare and exceptional circumstances, new freshmen and transfers may take a leave of absence during their first quarter with the permission of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education (or his or her designee).\" How relaxed are they with this? If I explain that I don't think I can complete the quarter, even with withdrawing classes, will they let me take a LoA? Thank you.",

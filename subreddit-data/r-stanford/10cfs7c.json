    "postText": "I've done the hard part of getting in, but I'm done with the high school tryhard shit for academics. I'm not planning on pursuing anything past a bachelor's, so I don't see much incentive towards getting a very high gpa. I can see myself taking leaves of absences to work on cool projects, and extended leaves for a startup. That being said, what should my goals be for class? In the classes that I deem will help my future, I'll put real effort to, but what about everything else?",

Having to keep an above average to excellent GPA leaves you stressed and prevents you from spending time on the classes you want\u2014but that's the price you usually pay for when wanting to go beyond a BA/BS. Friends that don't plan to purse anything past graduation, really do get the most out of their classes even if their grades/gpa dont necessarily reflect it.",

I\u2019d say you have already shown through high school that you are adept academically by getting into Stanford so it may seem weird that your gpa would not reflect that while in Stanford. I knew a lot of smart people in your shoes that cared more about projects and work outside of school but a lot inevitably regretted not having a higher gpa because a lot of top companies have gpa cut-offs and many people end up pursuing a Masters degree.\nJust my 2\u00a2",

It may seem like you are on top of the world right now but the truth is the world is changing, you will inevitably change in your 20s, and there may come a time that you\u2019d want to go to grad school in the future to switch careers or pursue something new altogether. And it is not the end of the world if you have a low GPA, but your life would be considerably easier if you have already established a 3.5+ in college. Otherwise, you will spend months and maybe years making up for bad grades by taking MOOCs and extension school classes. You seem like a very smart person if you got into Stanford so just keep doing YOU in college and perform at your best! The systems and processes, and qualities like discipline, diligence, and time management you would cultivate in college are for life. So don\u2019t let go, keep doing you! :)",

I thought I was finished school when I finished my pharmacy degree but 15 years later I applied for an MBA program that uses GPA as one of the metrics. Try hard but don\u2019t sacrifice your health both physical and mental. Eat well, exercise and most importantly get good sleep as this will have a direct bearing on your academic performance.

    "postText": "I'm an undergrad student currently attending georgia tech. I've previously attended 4 hackathons and have a good amount of experience with web dev and ML: I can get shit done when need be. What are my chances to get into treehacks given that I don't completely mess up the essays, have a decent portfolio/github, and I have a referral from a current stanford student? Planning to also finish the application today so I hope all the slots are not full yet.",

Former TreeHacks organizer here\u2014normally, it\u2019s around a 10% acceptance rate for our in-person hackathons (100% acceptance rate for Stanford students) because we fly accepted hackers out at no cost. But if you have a current TreeHacks organizer\u2019s referral, I\u2019d say your chances are very high :)",

    "postText": "Would appreciate any insight at all. I\u2019m a junior Economics major who\u2019s developed a really late interest in CS after several internships in product. I\u2019ve started the CS minor (CS106A/B/103) and now think I would like to shoot for applying for a MS CS instead to open up more opportunities. \n\nHow many courses do you think I should complete before applying? What\u2019s the earliest you\u2019ve seen someone apply for a CS Co-term in terms of experience? Ideally I\u2019d apply sooner than later because of visa and finaid reasons. \n\nThank you!!! \ud83e\udd79",

We were known/treated like the \u201cstepkids\u201d of a 90s era dysfunctional family.\n\nBut within the group, it was a blast. Lots of trauma bonding. A lot of the people enrolled has already been teaching in some capacity (probably because the program started 2 days after my undergrad graduation?) So I\u2019m guessing lots of folks took a year to teach private school or were aids or something rather than literally have two days off then jump in the deep end\u2026\n\nIt was a great place for resources and learning how to support your fellow teachers (which I took with me to each teaching job to create a community that helped new teachers by getting experienced ones\u2019 opinions and advice\u2026) But it was an intense 12 months. I kinda wish it had been a bit longer\u2026long enough for me to \u201csettle in\u201d and figure out how things worked a bit better. But done in one was also perfect for me at the time. \n\nBut that was a while ago\u2026hoping you hear more from more recent STEPers.",

There\u2019s a lot of variation depending on your placement, but the instructors are great with support for the most part. Definitely not easy though!",

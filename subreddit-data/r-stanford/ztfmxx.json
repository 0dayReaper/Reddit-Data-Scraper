Was there some update?\n\nAs of when the incident actually happened, the \"tree\" wasn't suspended - the person who plays the tree was suspended. The previous person who played the tree was supposedly welcome to come out of retirement (though I don't know if they did).  And it wasn't \"Stanford\" (i.e. the university) who suspended them, but rather the students of the marching band, because the person had not discussed the potentially inflammatory stunt with them beforehand.\n\nhttps://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/stanford-tree-mascot-suspended-for-holding-stanford-hates-fun-sign-during-game/",

Many (most) members of the band were in on the stunt (as evidenced by many of them holding the huge banner), but the band director was not. The band director made the decision to suspend the \u201cperson who plays the tree,\u201d which is functionally the same as suspending the tree because no former tree would betray the current tree (especially considering the former tree is more likely than not to support calling Stanford out for \u2018hating fun\u2019). All in all it\u2019s a very interesting and sad situation. Stanford, like every other school in the country, used covid as an excuse to reign in unwanted behavior. And, like every other school, now that the covid threat is more limited, Stanford has not given (and probably never will give) a lot of those privileges back. The effects are more pronounced at Stanford because Palo Alto is an extremely expensive place, forcing a lot of less wealthy students to make their own fun on campus. When the university stands in the way of that, as the tree and band have called out, things can get pretty miserable pretty quick.",

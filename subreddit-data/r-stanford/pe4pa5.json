    "postText": "\u26a0\ufe0f TRIGGER WARNING: racism, homophobia, violence \u26a0\ufe0f \n\nHi all \u2014\n\nIf you\u2019re not aware, today a \u201823 Stanford student by the name of Chaze Vinci uploaded a series of racist and homophobic posts on Instagram, including a doctored image of a beheaded person with a cropped photo of a Black individual\u2019s face, a suggestion that the Bible justifies the enslavement of Black people, racist caricatures of Black people (exaggerated facial features and images of gorillas), a homophobic remark toward a Stanford Student Body President, and other pernicious activity. You can view this all here, but beware that the content is disturbing. [Chaze Vinci Posts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17HAkPJZHc_2CT3OBYBcq01J7c-k4oLkb/view?usp=drivesdk)\n\nChaze Vinci has also been arrested for second degree burglary, which, given his rhetoric, reinforces his potential danger to the community. No matter your political views, this is wholly unacceptable and I urge you to report him to Stanford for committing an Act of Intolerance. This Google Doc has the form link as well as information to help you fill it out. \n[google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OhEK3eKXh3um0-Kebx4Rl1yDr1HQ_J4XeIAz1v6UvbE/edit)\n[Chaze Vinci arrest](https://www.franklinfavorite.com/news/article_a3438fd4-93ae-598f-8fae-d21e6ff51088.html)\n\nWe need everyone affiliated with our university to take action and spread the word. This is not a matter of politics or activism; it is about the right of ALL students, faculty, and staff to basic human dignity.\n\nUpdate: Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne has sent an email to the Stanford community detailing his concerns and the university\u2019s ongoing investigation of the matter: \u201cI want you to know that we are actively working on several fronts to address what has occurred, and to take actions to ensure the safety of our community,\u201d he wrote in the email. More updates to come if I see any\n\nUpdate #2: [The Stanford Daily](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2021/08/30/university-denounces-chaze-vincis-23-racist-social-media-posts/) has reported on the incident; we\u2019re still not sure if Chaze has been expelled or what specific actions the university is taking. Some students feel the president\u2019s email should have explicitly condemned the posts as racist, and are calling for Chaze\u2019s expulsion.\n\nUpdate #3: Per a university-wide email, Chaze has been banned from Stanford\u2019s campus and facilities. The university president said additional steps are being taken to respond to the incident, but further details about Chaze remain private by law. So we likely won\u2019t officially know whether he is expelled (though I think they\u2019re probably starting the legal process). There doesn\u2019t seem to be any clear confirmation that he will never again step on campus, but for now, he remains banned.",

The shocking thing is that he seemed like a perfectly normal guy as a freshman, and then suddenly, he started to align himself with SCR and just turned into a religious fanatic (not to say that SCR turns one into a fanatic, but SCR members are definitely not moderates). Don't know what caused this but it was a rather dramatic transformation. \n\nAnd I don't intend to be an apologist for him, but it's just sad to have witnessed this dreadful evolution. He's throwing away what many would kill for, but the reality is that with his blatant racism and criminal record, he's a threat to the stanford community and he must go.\n\n(Some other members of the class of 2023 might be able to shed some light on how he ran astray)",

There\u2019s nothing he can do or any well thought out, articulated legal argument can do.  The real world is so much different than the world you know being in university.  This is more of a public relations issue than legal.  Just keep these big picture ideas in your head when speculating about outcomes.

Vinci is hardly the first student to test the reach of the Leonard Law on our campus. And do you know how many have been kicked out for legally protected speech? Zero.\n\nAs pointed out by others, the details of the disciplinary action will not be public, so we'll never know what led to his suspension or potential future expulsion, but it will likely need to be based on conduct beyond the offensive social media posts that were widely publicized last week.\n\n(BTW, not everyone on this sub is anonymous.)",

He does need mental help and he should be entitled to redemption. But personally, from my perspective it would feel better if everyone was in agreement that what he said was awful and he should be punished for it immediately because as Americans we won\u2019t tolerate such racism and bigotry.

I sort of suspect this guy Chaze was trying to be provocative to point out the double-standard of white men saying violent things on social media vs. a black woman like Gabby endorsing violence against white men.\n\nThough obviously Chaze's stuff was less explicitly violent, if we're honest. More colorful to be sure, but also far less direct. Though TBF, do we ever have black women doing things like shooting up schools (just keying on student comments about feeling \"unsafe\")? I'm hard pressed to recall a single incident. I mention that bc of the different reaction, people publicly being outraged vs. people publicly being outraged AND fearful.\n\nPerhaps the threat is just more credible from a white male, so it triggers more of a reaction? Gabby said ugly shit, but she isn't taken seriously bc there is no perceived threat, whereas the indirect nature of Chaze's comments may have worked against him here, in that you can read what you like, including a threat or violent intent, into what he posted. \n\nI guess Chaze is gonna be famous in Federalist Society circles now.",

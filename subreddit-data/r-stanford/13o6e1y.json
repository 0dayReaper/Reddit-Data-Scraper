            "comment": "Going to be very difficult to get a internship as a rising freshman (as you noticed). \n\nIf you really want to try to make it happen, your best bet is going to be forging a relationship in person, and see if something manifests.  \n\nMake a list of every Stanford alumni in your immediate vicinity that you can find (well, of course be more selective if you're in an area with a lot of such alumni, like the Bay), and email all of them asking whether you could meet for coffee/mentorship.  \n\nMeet, tell your story, pump for info, \"oh how can I help?\", \"oh well I'd love to do an internship if possible, I'm good at X and Y\".  If you do a few dozen of these conversations, you might find someone open up.\n\nNow, if you've got a little bit of money (sounds like maybe not?), the even higher-volatility variant of the above--\n\n* Until your calendar is full up, email/linkedin every high-powered Stanford ugrad alumni you can find in the Bay.  Bias yourself towards founders &amp; VCs (most likely to be able to be immediately helpful).  \n\n(You should expect to get a lot of people ignoring your note or otherwise being non-helpful.  As long as your outbound notes are professional and thoughtful, that's fine!  If you reach out to 1000 alumni (you don't need to meaningfully customize each note!), and only 10% get set up as calls, that is 100 conversations you wouldn't have otherwise had.  No one is going to be offended to get your cold outreach, unless you handle the communications poorly.)\n\n* Ask for a zoom chat for mentorship; make sure, though to provide a couple specific questions (generic \"mentorship\" will make you sound like you don't know what you're looking for; people want to feel helpful, but they won't feel helpful if they feel like you don't know how you want to be helped).\n\n* When you talk, \"how can I help?\"--well, near the end of your spiel, mention an interest in summer internship/work in the Bay, or for a Bay organization (remote OK).  Someone might bite / have a opty / point you somewhere.\n\n* In this scenario, I'd then further suggest--if you have that $$$--shooting to come out to the Bay for a week or two (kind of as soon as you can reasonably get it done).  In your outreach, then, you can say \"zoom call or I'll be in the Bay the first two weeks of June\" (or w/e).\n\n* I.e., fill your calendar with ~1-2 weeks of meetings with Bay Stanford alums (I'd recommend VCs &amp; startup founders), slum it on someone's couch, rent a car, and criss-cross silicon valley &amp; sf.  Reasonable chance you get someone who says \"wow you're high initiative, want to help me out with project X?\".  Worst case, you've done ~100 meetings with high-powered Stanford alumni, some of who will be interested in being helpful.\n\nNote: \n\nIn the above scenario, I strongly encourage you to get zoom calls going ASAP, regardless of travel to the Bay or not.  \n\n1) You might find someone offers something helpful on a vid chat.  \n\n2) You probably need to learn how to network, tell your story, etc.  You'll probably feel awkward and like you're falling on your face a few times.  That's fine.  If you go do a few dozen of these types of calls and are modestly self-reflective, you'll realize you'll get 10x better by the end.  Better to learn in a remote context than to burn in-person relationships.\n\n(You can substitute, e.g., NYC or DC for the Bay, but you'll probably find that the Bay has the widest array of people who have flexibility to offer someone smart something very quickly.  E.g., if you are at Blackstone, you generally can't/won't be offering someone a summer internship on a dime.)\n\nTaking a step back, as a general \"how do I spend my summer\" plan--\n\nEven if you're not able financially to drop yourself into the Bay on a gamble, I'd strongly encourage you to consider making an aggressive outreach program to alumni (Bay, NYC, etc.).  You're at a unique point in your life in that there are a large number of high-powered people who will take your call simply because you are a rising freshman.\n\n(\"But I don't know what to ask?\"  Simpy asking people what they think has made them successful--what have they done differently than their peers?--can drive a great conversation.  1) People love to talk about themselves.  2) You can frame your interest in the mechanics of success, rather than, \"how do I become a Goldman Sachs partner?\"  \"I'm early in my career and not sure exactly where I want to go, but I know I want to crush it.  Talk to me about how you've crushed it.\"  People want to help mentor those who will be successful; focusing a discussion around success will give you that aura (even if you have little idea what you truly want to \"be\").)",

Traveling to the Bay is probably not possible for me but I will definitely consider reaching out to Stanford alumni in my city on LinkedIn. I will try to find advice/opportunities that align with my interests and see what happens from there.\n\nI also appreciate your recommendation of framing conversations more in a \"How did you achieve success?\" way rather than a \"Tell me how to get X career at Y company\" manner. As someone who is still undecided about my career path this is extremely valuable.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a junior with a passion for societal harm, and I was wondering if you guys had any recommendations for classes, clubs, or other activities that I should pursue in order to maximize the damage I inflict upon society.\n\nI\u2019ve decided to major in CS, and I\u2019m leaning towards the AI or HCI track. Last quarter I took Coding for Social Good to learn how to accomplish the contrary more effectively, and while the class provided a decent overview, I found it lacking in technical depth, particularly for the implementation of biased algorithms that achieve optimal racial prejudice. If anyone here is majoring in STS, I\u2019d also be interested in hearing more about the tech-related social issues I could potentially help exacerbate.\n\nI\u2019m open to taking classes outside the major as well. Last year I took a few intro psych classes to better understand how to instil belief in fake news and drive political polarization in the United States. Looking ahead to future quarters I\u2019d appreciate some suggestions for classes about the history of oppressed groups (maybe CSRE or FEMGEN?), as I\u2019d like to gain better insight into the oppressor mindset and methodology (something that fulfils ED would be a bonus).\n\nCareer-wise I\u2019m pretty undecided, but mishandling biometric information for a startup like Clearview AI seems appealing to me. Last summer I interned at a FAANG company but I was ultimately left disappointed by their respect for user privacy, feigned or not. On the entrepreneurial front, I considered hiring someone else to build me a quirky social media app that stores sensitive user data in a misconfigured database, but that seems to be a saturated market here at Stanford.\n\nAny advice would be welcome - thanks in advance!",

Create fake but believable social media accounts, specific to each locale. Use a service like Clearview to gather as much info about people as possible. Then have your swarm send as much targeted destabilizing info as possible. Tell people who their neighbors voted for. Tell people which of their children watch transgender porn. Send anti-vax info to people on the fence about vaccination. You could do so much damage.\n\nEdit 2: A misconfigured database is child's play. Go big or go home.

    "postText": "any thoughts on these student gyms? as people continue clinging onto their fitness resolutions this january, i can\u2019t help but wonder how a school who had a single man donate hundreds of millions, a school that netted $12 billion in 2021 endowment returns alone, has built out only two student gyms that can probably accommodate about 1/2 the amount of students that are in there at any given time.  how difficult would it be to add some more benches / squat racks?  aoerc been smelling like my goddamn high school wrestling room lately.",

Though to be fair, I've tried multiple community gyms in the South Bay and they are just as crowded during peak hours.\n\nI wish I could find evidence of this beyond my memory, but I'm pretty sure when it first opened, AOERC had longer hours (i.e. closed after midnight some nights), which helped to decompress the after dinner hours somewhat.",

And there is an absolutely adequate sidewalk to redo and block half of campus off. Why spend money on gyms when you can spend it on frivolous shit that inconveniences students.",

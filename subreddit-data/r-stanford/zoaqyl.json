    "postText": "Hi everyone! I was just deferred from Stanford in REA (kinda a bummer but lwk motivating too ngl) and I was wondering if I could submit additional LORs (1 maybe 2?) to the admissions committee. Has anyone had experiences with this? If so, please let me know!\n\nThanks so much for all the help!\n\nMods, hopefully this qualifies as a \u201cspecific and constructive\u201d question as I haven\u2019t been able to find anything else online and figured this would be the best place to sample Stanford students.",

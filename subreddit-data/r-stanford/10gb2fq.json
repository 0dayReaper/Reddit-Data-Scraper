There's a MSU -Muslim Student Union- group on Whatsapp for Jumah prayer, halaqas and other events, if interested I can send you invitation link.\nEdit: more clarification: there's a room that is a musala for the Muslim Community only, there is also a multi faith big room The Sanctuary, Muslims and other religious communities reserve it (Jummah is there). And there is another small room in Packard (EE building) reserved only during prayer times for duhr, asr and maghrib ONLY for Muslims.",

On my way down, I drove past a few cars going up the levels. I considered signaling but AFAIK there's no clear way of clearly communicating \"it's full\" outside of yelling it out to them.\n\nI associate other cars flashing blinkers at me with more of a \"warning/check your car or lights\" or an angry gesture (i.e., when I've cut someone off on accident on the highway).",

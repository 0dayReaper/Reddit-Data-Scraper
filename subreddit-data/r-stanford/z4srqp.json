    "postText": "I am interested in both ChemE and BioE but I'm currently applying to PhD program in Chemical Engineering as we can only choose one program. However, there are labs in both departments that I am interested in working in, but I'm not familiar with policies behind for example working in a BioE lab as a ChemE PhD student. What's the policy around this?",

            "comment": "Yes and a good number of chemE students go out of department, in not only bioE but also material science, physics, school of medicine, etc.\n\nThough one thing to keep in mind is the amount of funding different PhD programs give. School of medicine gives 4 years, bioE 2 years (assuming you join a bioE lab; 1 year for out of dept), chemE 2 quarters (yes quarters lol). So if you wanted to join a bioE lab without any external or internal funding it may be more challenging, especially if a prof is choosing between you and a bioE student that comes with 2 years of funding. You can imagine joining a school of medicine lab would be more so given that school of medicine PhD students come with 4 years of funding.\n\nNonetheless it would be PI-to-PI dependent so definitely reach out to them. It may also be good to look for any chemE students in the bioE labs you are interested in and asking about their experiences in rotating/joining from chemE.",

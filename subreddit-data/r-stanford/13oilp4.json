The undergrads panic dump all their belongings in the dumpsters before moving out--printers, mini fridges and everything. I found it really disgusting from a consumer standpoint but there were guys in pickups loading all those mini fridges. Someone was making some good money off all that free stuff.",

My son and his freshman year roommate would dumpster dive during move-out, and his friend would re-sell new textbooks and other things online. My son couldn't believe the things that were abandoned. That's how he ended up with his mini fridge and some new beats headphones, etc.",

It's a day in which residents can throw out big stuff and the city picks it up. A friend and I got tons of free stuff in good conditions that rich people throw out, like chairs and a desk.",

            "comment": "Grades are not everything, but I think it would be very beneficial for you if you were to reflect more carefully about why you got that grade, so that you can make a better decision about this matter, and so that the community can offer you better advice with this additional context. What decision you make regarding retaking a course will be determined in a significant way by the reason you did not learn the material well the first time.\n\nWas it because you didn't have time to do the homework? Was it because of a particular part of the course? Was it because of a gaming addiction, procrastination, family incidents, culture shock as a frosh... the list goes on; and each response may lead you to a different answer regarding whether you should/will retake the course, and how you will prepare in the meantime.\n\nOutside of the grade, I would also encourage you to think about the utility of the course itself.\n\nPeople come into Stanford with varying levels of mathematical background. The purpose of 51, and other introductory courses, is to catch everyone up to the same level, as well as to provide vital prerequisite knowledge to pursue courses later on in students' academic careers. \n\n51 is especially crucial to many students because it gives insight and some beginning fluency in linear algebra and multivariable differentiation, which are as common and as deeply assumed as prerequisite knowledge in upper division STEM courses as the ability to solve a quadratic or do simple mental arithmetic.\n\nI would go so far as to say that even if you decide against formally retaking the course, you should go out of your way to ensure you understand the material - if you want to make the most of your pursuits of quantitarive fields you will need a good understanding of the material presented in the class.\n\nEdit: grammar",

I struggled with the transition to math at Stanford and with test taking personally but understood most of the content (even if my grade didn\u2019t really reflect that). \nI will say that I didn\u2019t retake it but I learned the material so well from other courses that solidified it (ie more physics, math, and engineering) that now I would probably be comfortable teaching the class. So it isn\u2019t the end all. But if you really think you didn\u2019t understand it and you need to it could be worth considering. I know many people who did. But please consider opportunity cost of those five units.",

Learning such foundational content much better than \"C\" level can save a lot of time in coursework downstream (esp. for someone who like OP who will be just a 2nd-quarter frosh), so precisely because time is so valuable it would a rather effective use of time when the purpose of retaking is to improve understanding of content (rather than focused on GPA aspect).",

    "postText": "Hi all! I just got in Stanford MSME last week whilst I also have a full ride PhD (also ME) offer from Northwestern. Since then I've been thinking really hard and reaching out to people on which one to attend. My end goal is get a teaching/research position in academia. The majority of advices I received is take on NU PhD offer since if my end goal is PhD there is no point risking applying for PhD again in two years time during Stanford masters. Not sure how biased these responses are but I am sure yall are most familiar with Stanford so I'd thought it would be a good idea to ask you guys!\n\nTo the mods: I'd assume I didn't violate the \"admission question\" restriction since I got in and am not asking how to get in? but pardon me if Im wrong : )",

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently a phd student at a great program who did their MSME at Stanford. If you do research with an advisor at Stanford during your MS, they can actually sign a form that pledges funding to you and converts you to a phd student nearly instantly, so long as this is signed far enough in advance of the end of your MS (I think it needs to be before your last quarter or something near then).\n\nI started doing research during my first quarter at Stanford but my research advisor did not have enough money to convert me. I reapplied one year after the start of my MSME having published a paper and was admitted to the phd program. Out of 40 admits in my cohort, only 2 were current students at Stanford. I decided to turn down the offer to go elsewhere due to research fit. However, if I had stayed, I would only have had to do 3 more years to graduate, effectively making it as if I were in the phd program the whole time.\n\nThat said, the advice I always give is this: a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It\u2019s way less risky to take the NU offer if you want to do a phd. All this is just to say that it isn\u2019t impossible to have your cake and eat it, too.\n\nGood luck. Feel free to PM me for more info.\n\nEdit: another possibility is that if during the masters you apply for a 3-year fellowship like NSF or NDSEG and get it, then you will almost certainly not even need to re-apply to get in the program. Just sign the form and you\u2019re done, since you wouldn\u2019t cost your advisor anything.",

You barely see (lets say engineering major) Profs in MIT/Stanford graduate from somewhere other than MIT/Stanford themselves or Caltech UC-Berkeley. While even UIUC, NU, Ohio state profs are mostly from these tier 1 engineering schools. So for an academia end goal, it seems like Stanford's name gets you far. Although we all personally knows that it is the research, the prestige of the PhD supervisor that really tell more about a person's capability.",

Extremely high cost, both in direct tuition and salary forgeone, and it is very possibly not necessary for OP.\n\nMaster's programs generally exist as cash cows for the university--propped up, in part, by the fact that they are employment visa factories.  If you do an MSE program, you are paying for a lot of \"value\" that isn't really worth much to you.  And if your goal is to go into academia (like OP's would appear to be), taking on a giant loan burden is just \"bad advice\".\n\nIf OP isn't sure if they can get in to, e.g., Stanford, something to consider.  Even then, the financial cost vs a PhD is crazy high.  That doesn't appear to be the issue, though--OP simply didn't apply.\n\n&gt; Also, with the current economic and industry environment, getting a position at top industry labs like Google is a long shot.\n\nNot needed, although nice.  Go join spacex or anduril or similar, work on cool stuff, and re-do your app in ~6 months.\n\nIf OP was shooting to work on deep learning/LLMs, the calculus might be a little different, but MSE is a different ball game.",

            "comment": "I was in a similar position almost 20 years ago. I had a fully funded PhD offer from NC State math and admission to the MS program at Stanford's scientific computing program (now ICME). I polled my undergrad advisors, all faculty at my ugrad institution. Three of four said to go to Stanford, because getting a foot in the door via the MS program would help me get into the PhD program. One of four said go to NC State, because I'd receive more individual attention.\n\nI went to Stanford, and it paid off. During my first year I took the PhD classes and studied for quals. Then I took quals and passed, which put me in the PhD program with opportunities for funding. The three advisors said that the \"Stanford name\" on my degree would take me further than NC State, and they were right---especially since my goal was professional research.\n\nThe one \"mistake\" I made was taking out loans for my first year at Stanford, which totaled more than my entire ugrad loans; I'm still paying off that loan. What I didn't know at the time is: if you're proactive about reaching out to faculty, you might find one willing to fund you as an RA. There's a lot of money \"out there\" in faculty coffers. You just need demonstrate your value to one person, and then you get to save many thousands of dollars.",

You\u2019re right that there\u2019s an element of luck - an MS student will not be prioritized in terms of an advisor\u2019s funding plans, even if they theoretically had enough funding for you.\n\nI think that if for whatever reason you wanted to go somewhere better than NU, the advice to do something productive for one year and re-apply could be good. I do have a friend who turned down Michigan and was admitted to MIT the year after. It\u2019s hard to say what is the \u201cbest\u201d decision without specific information about how competitive you are as an applicant.\n\nIn my case, the reason I did a masters was that I knew I wasn\u2019t competitive enough as an applicant out of undergrad to go to a top tier program. I took the MS to shore up my skills, do more research, and get better recs. While in your case I think NU is probably the safest decision, it\u2019s not as obvious as the other commenters are claiming.\n\nIf your end goal is academia, the years you spend aren\u2019t as costly as choosing a \u201cbad\u201d program (I don\u2019t think NU is bad, just explaining the decision calculus). It\u2019s typically a very long road with a high probability of a postdoc after your phd, so a year or two extra isn\u2019t prohibitive. The decision you make regarding where you get your education and who your PhD advisor is ultimately has a massive impact on your chances of professorship, and academic connections also play a big role.\n\nFinally, the cost isn\u2019t anything near 200k (unless you\u2019re counting opportunity cost), and if you manage to TA, it actually covers the tuition of the quarter you TA plus a stipend that is close to the cost of tuition.",

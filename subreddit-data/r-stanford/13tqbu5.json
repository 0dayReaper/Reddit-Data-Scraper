    "postText": "I\u2019m interested in how older undergrads/transfers are treated. 28/29 years range. I know that Stanford houses them separately with grad students only bc they\u2019re uncomfortable with housing them in frosh housing. Besides that, do you think they\u2019re a part of campus community or not at all? Do you think they discriminate against them in admissions or on campus, in hiring/lab/research/assistant work? Or in friend groups or study groups or student clubs? I\u2019m aware the 1975 Age Discrimination Act outlaws age based discrimination in federal-funds relieving education institutions but it\u2019s a subtle and not very well articulated thing. A prof might say: a student doesn\u2019t have recent experiences or might not be trainable? Or maybe student clubs wouldn\u2019t want older students? Or they\u2019ll say: too much of a gap in study?",

The company board constitution, bylaws, and certain kinds of stock plans have more to do with that than your visa status. https://www.fastcompany.com/3060507/how-founders-can-avoid-getting-fired-by-the-board-they-created\n\nThe easiest way requiring no board packing, bylaws customization, or fancy stock plans is simply to never relinquish more than 49% of the stock equity from your personal ownership.\n\nAn alternative which could be easier for cofounders, early investors, and prospective board members to stomach might be a five year irrevocable CEO appointment, but talk to a lawyer because bylaws surgery is an arcane skill.",

If you start a US company as an international candidate (maybe on H1B or F1 OPT), you need to establish an employer-employee relationship with your own company allowing yourself to be fired by some board member.. Not sure if this can be solved by setting up SPVs or Shell companies where stock policy changes the minute you're fired.",

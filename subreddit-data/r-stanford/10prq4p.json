The free Stanford Engineering Everywhere one appears to be a significantly older version than either the Coursera or the Autumn 2018 lectures on youtube. Can you elaborate on what the difference in content between these is?",

Who teaches the YT lectures? Andrew NG? If so, they\u2019re probably pretty good. If you want rigor, avoid coursera (even though Andrew also did those, they\u2019re meant for a wider audience than the Stanford course.)\n\n\n\nAs an aside, the course reader, which is free, is available on the CS229 website and is excellent as a stand alone text. You could read it without watching the lectures and develop just as much intuition.",

It sounds like the Stanford course is the way to go unless the mathematics gets overwhelming then I can try the Coursera one. I should technically have all the prereqs but he throws up a lot of equations pretty quickly so it can be hard to follow it all sometimes. \n\nBy course reader you mean the lecture notes pdfs? Thanks!",

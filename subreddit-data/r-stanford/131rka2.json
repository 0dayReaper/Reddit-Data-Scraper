    "postText": "Hello everyone, \n\nI am an incoming international grad student in aero &amp; astro with a full felloship from the department for the first 5 quarters. Just a few days ago I received my initial I-20 document and following the instructions it seems that I will need to pay around \\~500$ for my visa. At the same time I need to buy the ticket for coming to San Fransisco which would probably cost another \\~500$. This is a significant amount for me to pay at the moment, but I have not found anything on Stanford's page about covering these expenses. Taking into account that I was also invited for a visit day (I actually could not make it in the end) where they offered to pay the ticket expenses, I was wondering if there is a way for me to ask for some financial support for such expenses or if there are any other alternatives.\n\nThank you!",

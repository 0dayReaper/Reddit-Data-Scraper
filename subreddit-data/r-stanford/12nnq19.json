If you can\u2019t find someone just park anyways then; they check pretty infrequently. I know people who don\u2019t have a parking pass because it\u2019s cheaper to be fined occasionally rather than pay monthly. This might vary depending on location though",

You could also park in visitor parking every day which will be really expensive but is an option. If you just park without a pass, they do ticket a good amount and will put a boot on your car after you get a good amount of tickets.",

Here's an imgur album with more (reddit albums have a max of 20, so I picked 20 of my favorite output): https://imgur.com/a/9NLVU8j",

It requires that I input a text prompt to describe what form I want the logo to take. Could you please generate for me a set of 20 interesting and relevant text prompts related to Stanford comprising short text descriptions, each one on a separate line? Please make them unnumbered. Also, please incorporate elements and imagery that are relevant to Stanford University, eg natural features of the South SF Bay Area like coastal redwoods, scientific research, technology, academia, things like that. Do not write them in a narrative style, but rather separate each concept into small, bitesize chunks of no more than 5-10 words.**\n\nWhich elicited this response:\n\n&gt; Stanford Arch wrapped in redwood trees\n\n&gt;Rodin's Thinker with Stanford emblem\n\n&gt;Hoover Tower surrounded by tech devices\n\n&gt;Stanford's Quad as futuristic metropolis\n\n&gt; ...\n\nI followed up with:\n\n&gt; **Can you use more descriptive nouns?**\n\nTo receive:\n\n&gt;Majestic redwood-framed Stanford Arch\n\n&gt;Rodin's contemplative Thinker, Stanford emblem\n\n&gt;Hoover Tower encircled by holographic\n\n&gt;...\n\nAnd then clarified that:\n\n&gt; **Can you make sure each prompt has maybe 3-5 independent phrases?**\n\nto get:\n\n&gt; Majestic redwood, Stanford Arch, sunrays, student life, innovative spirit\n\n&gt;Rodin's Thinker, Stanford emblem, academic spirit, research excellence, green landscape\n\n&gt;Hoover Tower, holographic tech, ethereal glow, Silicon Valley, soaring ambitions\n\n&gt;Stanford Quad, futuristic metropolis, scholarly minds, diverse community, cutting-edge research\n\n&gt;Palm Drive, autumn leaves, bicycle rides, blue sky, intellectual curiosity\n\n&gt;Coastal redwoods, Main Quad, sandstone architecture, sundial, robust collaboration\n\n&gt;Leland Stanford, Pacific Railroad, timeless legacy, innovation hub, learning environment\n\n&gt;MemChu, colorful mosaic, harmony, unity, cultural exchange\n\n&gt;Dish Trail, rolling hills, serenity, nature's embrace, academic pursuit\n\n&gt;Cardinal red, oval, interdisciplinary approach, world-class faculty, transformative education\n\n&gt;Windhover, contemplative center, soothing water, relaxation, clear thoughts\n\n&gt;Gates Computer Science, binary code, breakthrough technology, human progress\n\n&gt;Cantor Arts Center, artistic expression, ancient artifacts, modern masterpieces\n\n&gt;Solar Observatory, celestial exploration, astrophysics, cosmic discoveries, infinite universe\n\n&gt;Lake Lagunita, rippling water, wildlife sanctuary, ecological awareness, sustainability\n\n&gt;Green Library, vast knowledge, boundless wisdom, literary heritage, preservation\n\n&gt;Frost Amphitheater, live performances, cultural enrichment, community engagement\n\n&gt;Packard Electrical Engineering, circuitry, nanotechnology, quantum leap, bright future\n\n&gt; design thinking, creative solutions, real-world impact, interdisciplinary\n\n&gt;Tresidder Union, vibrant social scene, diverse cuisine, camaraderie, college memories\n\nto which I then appended various modifiers (eg 4k, high quality, intricate, etc.)",

                    "comment": "well, give it a month or two and I\u2019m sure whatever future image model release then will blow current options out of the water! Plus, I\u2019m sure someone more experienced w/ SD &amp; \u201cprompt engineering\u201d or w/e could produce much better results than my handful of hours goofing around right now! Heck, just moving from my $250 3060ti -&gt; a $700 3090 would allow for much faster turnaround, more options to choose from, initial renders at higher native res, etc. that all together would probably have a non-negligible impact on quality\n\nas for why \u2014 for fun mostly? Was curious to see how it\u2019d interpret the structure of the logo, and it\u2019s one of many different inputs I\u2019ve passed passed through. Been following the generative image space for nearly a decade and super impressed with every new development! I do recognize that sharing output from these is not unlike sharing baby / pet photos or the contents of one\u2019s dreams, more interesting to oneself than any external audience, but I\u2019m ultimately only robbing folks of the seconds it takes them to read the title and hide the post :p\n\nwhat specifically do you dislike about these? To my eye, most of the lingering errors seem to involve border continuity \u2014 an object starts on one side of some sort of division and either disappears or finds itself displaced or refracted on the other side. However, I\u2019d note the rather minimal post-hoc workflow for these output. If there were a specific one I especially cared about, I might iteratively generate inpainted improvements (and spend a bit more time on touch-ups in traditional digital art software) until a fully satisfying result were reached. Much different from pushing things through a nearly-automated workflow!",

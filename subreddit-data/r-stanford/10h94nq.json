    "postText": "Stanford has a team for a massive multiplayer online game of Risk (the game of world domination).  (The teams are colleges that have football teams, but you really don't need to know anything about football to play.)  Go to [https://www.collegefootballrisk.com/](https://www.collegefootballrisk.com/) to join Stanford's team!\n\nYou can be as lowkey as just submitting your once a day move on the [game site](https://www.collegefootballrisk.com/), you can be actively involved in our strategy planning on the [Stanford Discord](https://discord.gg/WzVjTeP), ask questions to learn about the game on the [Stanford Discord](https://discord.gg/WzVjTeP), or anything in between.  One of the most popular things among our players is making memes at r/CollegeFootballRisk, which is fun and helps win us allies. (In the last round of Risk in 2020, we even won [the Team Heismeme Award and the Best Image Heismeme](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeFootballRisk/comments/gm4yj4/announcing_the_2020_heismeme_champions/).)\n\nThere are six rolls a week (Mon-Sat) at 7:30 PM Pacific Time, so submit your move before 7:30 PM each day.  On Day 1 (today, Friday, January 20), we can only defend Palo Alto.  Starting on Day 2 (tomorrow, Saturday, January 21), we can attack any neighboring territory and defend our existing territories.\n\nAnd, if for some reason you miss the beginning, you can join our team any day during the season.  The season is estimated to last 50 days (unless it becomes very evident that a team will win).\n\nIf you've played this game before (Risk 1.0 in 2018 and/or Risk 2.0 in 2020), you can read about [the changes here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeFootballRisk/comments/108cltp/college_football_risk_is_back_season_3_starts/) in this year's Risk 3.0: the map is North America this year, there's region bonuses, and so many other new features!  Risk 1.0 was run by at Stanford player, so help us continue the legacy!\n\n[Risk 3.0 Starting Map](https://preview.redd.it/8ui750uip9da1.png?width=838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f62f776cadc80a4fa1cde144d27c18e76ca96ef2)",

    "postText": "Hi there, I am a post-graduate student at a law school in Europe doing an exchange semester at the Stanford Law Faculty starting in September 2023 and I have this big problem that exchange students are not eligible to live on campus, according to the Stanford info page.\n\nMy question would be; Is there some sort of way to still make this happen? I was thinking about maybe picking up a job at the campus - would that make me qualified for an on-campus living? \n\nI am asking because while I would be ready to pay 3k-3.5k for rent outside campus, I am really exploring any other way that would cost me less and be safe at the same time.",

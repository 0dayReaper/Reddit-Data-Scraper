    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI have been lucky enough to be granted admissions to Yale, Princeton and Stanford. I'm an international student and I want to focus on politics, IR and economics and possibly apply to law schools in the US afterwards. Can you please give me some advice and some points that I have to consider about each of these schools?\n\nThank you so much!!",

            "comment": "Someone asked a similar question about Stanford vs. Harvard vs. Yale for law and politics, so I'm going to copy and paste it here since it's substantially the same, as HYPS is also an acronym.  Feel free to ask a follow-up though.[https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/129p5ev/comment/jer1cqg/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/129p5ev/comment/jer1cqg/)\n\n&gt;PoliSci-History alum here. There's a reason why HYS is an acronym. That being said, I would suggest trying to go to law school at a different place than your undergrad though to give you a second alumni network.\n&gt;\n&gt;Anyway, back to the present. Try to visit each school. Whether you visit or not, get a sense for its culture and what you'd enjoy.\n&gt;\n&gt;The ability to succeed in law and politics from HYS is virtually indistinguishable. Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Georgetown all rotate every couple of years in the top 4 for having the most alumni in the US Senate, for example. In the US House, those four are the top for private schools, though a lot of state schools perform better in the House than the Senate. From 1994-2005, eight of the nine Supreme Court justices were alumni of Harvard, Yale, and/or Stanford. All have produced U.S. presidents, foreign presidents and prime ministers, etc. Among non-famous alumni, these are three of the preeminent schools in the country, especially in the fields of law and politics.\n&gt;\n&gt;The ability to be successful in law or politics or to get a good PoliSci education isn't going to be how you can decide between Stanford, Harvard, and Yale. You have to decide on culture, environment, weather, dorms, sports, how far from home you want to be, etc.",

If you are pursuing politics, IT, and Econ, Yale has better programs and alumni relationships for that. It\u2019s also closer to DC if you want to dive into more political opportunities. I also believe that yale has a higher matriculation rate into Law school. Additionally\u2026have you seen the food at Yale dining? Impeccable. Stanford? Kinda sucks.",

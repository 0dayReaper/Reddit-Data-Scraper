    "postText": "Hi! I was wondering about what types of responsibilities CAs have towards the end of the quarter? Like, are they expected to stay on campus even after final examinations (to help out with grading I assume) or would we be free to leave as soon as finals are over? Or do responsibilities only conclude once grades are due?\n\nI'm trying to find out when I should be safe to purchase a plane ticket back home, so any information would be helpful. Thank you!",

If you do you might be able to join remotely or it may be a full remote meeting. Way too many variables. \n\nJust ask\u2014there's no harm in doing it.",

Generally instructors are understanding of our schedules, I'd approach your conversation with your professor rather like \"I will be flying back on this date, let me know if there's anything I need sorted in-person before then\".",

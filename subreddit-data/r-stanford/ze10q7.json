    "postText": "Currently MCS/Data Science undergrad and deciding on a coterm program. I know that the CS coterm is vastly more popular than the Stats coterm, but for those working as data scientists/quant researchers/machine learning engineers, is the extra coursework in the CS department (programming) vs. in the Stats department (modeling) more useful in industry? Do you wish you took more coursework in the other department? For reference, whichever path I take, I plan to supplement with coursework from the other side as well. I am also not sure I want to go into tech, and I fear that CS would pigeonhole me into more developer roles which I am not quite as interested in. Thanks!",

Depending on the type of work you end up doing (alpha vs. low latency), you\u2019ll need skills from both categories.

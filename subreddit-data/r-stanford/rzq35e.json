    "postText": "I probably don\u2019t need to be writing this post, but I hope it can be of some use to people. \n\nToday I had dinner with someone. There was nothing special about it; we spoke about some interesting subjects and I enjoyed it. But something about that conversation felt different, like an inflection point. It was probably the first time since I was 13 where I felt like I had a real, authentic conversation with someone face to face. Like I was seen and heard, and nothing more or else. \n\nI didn\u2019t share anything remotely personal with them; nothing transformative happened, except perhaps the small, but meaningful signs of emerging friendship. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s this pandemic or the superficial culture of Stanford \u2014 probably both \u2014 but these moments feel so rare. With my years of mental illness and other problems, it felt so hard won and so gratifying. I never thought those years would ever appear to change, or end. \n\nI feel a glimmer of hope. This may be another false alarm, but I guess that\u2019s what hope does to you. It flickers at you, and it almost always leaves you in the darkness, but at some point, I\u2019d like to believe, it stays on. And you see the light, and it never leaves you, never goes out without you. \n\nI hope I saw that light.",

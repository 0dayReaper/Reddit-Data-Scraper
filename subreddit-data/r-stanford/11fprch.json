Where can I look? I am really scared that I won\u2019t find anything (affordable).\n\nI still live with my parents and work at the side.",

A studio would be your best bet, but I think you\u2019ll pay more like $3k since it is a short term rental\n\n\n\n(The rents are very high in this area. Before I moved here, I lived in a fairly large metro that isn\u2019t exactly known for being cheap in a high-rise with a wrap around terrace, marble counter tops, etc. For the same price here, I could get a second floor walk up with beige carpet from 2005. Lol.)",

            "comment": "I think at Stanford we have this mentality that Stanford is super easy because we have a strong safety net. It's preposterous because it's like saying \"We have welfare. Why aren't you making partner at top law firms like Skadden Arps or pursuing a PhD at MIT in Aerospace Engineering?\". It is also melded into our minds by people who've never been to Stanford and claim stuff like \"Everyone gets an A and no one fails out\" and \"The hardest part of Stanford is getting in\". We have grade inflation but that doesn't make mastering difficult topics any easier. It also exacerbates the perfectionist toxicity that makes getting back up after a failure almost a herculean task. The hardest part of Stanford is getting into Stanford is mostly false. I worked way harder to succeed at Stanford than getting into Stanford. All of my friends who work in the real world tell me that Stanford was much harder than their jobs. It's just that no one ever talks about how hard it is. We play a game where everyone pretends that they're having a good time. I've never worked harder in my entire life than in my undergraduate career at Stanford. I was shocked to hear a friend of mine claim Stanford was really hard for him and that he was struggling. He was a U.S. Special Forces operator who fought in Afghanistan for 4 years. He told me Stanford kicked his ass and that going to war for 4 years as a Green Beret didn't prepare him for the rigors of Stanford. This is a place where you get what you put in but it doesn't make getting a top-notch education easier. People like to pretend Stanford is a cakewalk where you can stroll onto the pristine campus and soak in the sweet, sweet prestige while getting a nice tan. That is simply not true. Stanford is hard.",

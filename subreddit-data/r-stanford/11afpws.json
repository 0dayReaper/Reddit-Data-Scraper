    "postText": "Hello! \n\nSo I absolutely bombed the midterm despite giving it my best lol (like damn near 0% could've just stayed home). I haven't really even been doing that well on the assignments. I go to LaIR, office hours, and ask my friends who know the content already but I just seem and apparently am just incompetent in this field. Apart from the fact that I feel discouraged from doing CS or symsys (lol) I'm questioning whether it's even possible to pass and if it would be better to either withdraw or switch C/NC. \n\nBeing humbled terribly rn and could use some advice lol.",

            "comment": "If you failed the midterm, probably not if it is an appreciable percent of your grade. You sometimes hear of students who make comebacks, but its not that common (in my experience from TAing) and, imo, its less stressful to drop the course and try again after fixing the issues that are causing your failure. Why are you doing badly? Lack of studying? Not prepared (i.e., did you take 106A?)?",

I asked him to hop on a call 1 to 1 about whether I should go C/NC and he was able to offer insight into my grade beyond the TA's (ultimately, remember it's Keith who will decide your grade).\n\nDon't feel too bad about it: you're definitely in the minority if you haven't been humbled by an exam here before. I got humbled by 106B as well (50ish on midterm, 90ish on final, ended with a B). Comebacks are definitely possible, but you'll just have to put in a good deal of work.\n\nReflect on went wrong here. Remember that generally, the CS department is fairly generous with grades. Also, consider what your assignment grades are. Iirc, assignments make up the majority of the grade in your class. If you're consistently getting check+ and +, you may still be in solid shape to potentially pass.",

And I kinda just through myself into CS106B after taking a huge 2 year break from coding (so makes sense).\n\nWhether you can still pass 106B depends on what is the highest raw score you get right now if you got all the points available (final, next assignments, class/lecture participation), and add some room for a slight percent bump from curve. If this raw score isn't at least a D- (if you just want to pass), then it is very unlikely you will be able to pass. If it is, guage how likely you feel you can get those points.\n\nThe curve helps a bit but I don't think you should bank on it since it didn't move my grade at all from my raw score.",

            "comment": "If it's any comfort, I did extremely poorly on the midterm (this was last winter with Keith) and quite poorly on the final: well below the median for both tests. Keep in mind that the CS department curves grades very generously and to my knowledge, fails very few and rarely gives grades lower than a B- (for these core classes). I personally ended with a B. Like the other commenter said, I would suggest talking to Keith directly about how to move forward. Best of luck! You'll be through with it soon",

            "comment": "From the syllabus:\n\n&gt;Assuming that both your assignment score and your composite exam score represent passing work, you will receive the letter grade assigned by the grading curve. Otherwise, you will receive a non-passing grade. (The numbers denoting \u201cpassing work\u201d are set at the discretion of the instructor. We will likely use 60% as a cutoff for passing work for programming assignments and 50% as a cutoff for passing work for exams, subject to change.)\n\nSo probably no, but I would recommend talking to Keith like other people mentioned before making any plan.",

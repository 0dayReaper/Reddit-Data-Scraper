    "postText": "\ud83d\udc4b Hey there, Stanford Renters! \u00a0\n\nAs a tenant myself, I'm not sure if my landlord is treating me fairly or if my expectations are unrealistic and so am curious about what others are up to and how effective/successful they've been.\u00a0This is a [survey for current renters](https://forms.gle/y9WncFjGMhoywFmJ9) to better understand what major challenges and solutions exist when it comes to renting residential rental properties. The first 25 people to respond will receive an Amazon or Starbucks gift card, my best practices and the results of this survey as a thank you. If you prefer to answer free-form, please feel free to do so in the comment thread below.\n\nThis survey will remain active from\u00a0Oct 31, 2022 until Nov 15, 2022 after which I'll tally the votes and summarize its findings to share with the broader rental tenant community.\n\nQuestions I'm hoping to get answered:\n\n\\- What types of property manager (e.g. owner/operator, on-site property manager, off-site property manager) have you worked with in the past?\n\n\\- What is your top goal as a renter (e.g. temp, long-term, rent to buy eventually, get government funding)\n\n\\- What are your most resource-intensive/painful/urgent challenges as a tenant?\n\n\\- What workarounds/solutions do you currently leverage to mitigate against your top challenges noted above?\n\n\\- On a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high), how satisfied are you with the current workarounds/solutions listed above? Why?\n\nIf you prefer to not answer publicly, a DM is always appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nNAAFL",

It\u2019s an extremely crowded space and there are multiple heavyweights in the industry that see resident portals as a freebie add-on feature, not a business. Your best bet is to find some niche service/product and get acquired so it can be bolted on to someone else\u2019s entrenched product.",

Yes compared to now the pool was wealthier, but selective colleges I would argue are a phenomenon relative to other schools and so I think it is fair to argue that schools weren\u2019t really selective in the way we think of it. The closest they came, and what really began the phenomenon of selectivity was colleges imposing barriers against Jews, Blacks, and other groups they thought of as undesirable.",

Of the Ivies until c. 1970, Dartmouth, Princeton, and Yale were fully men-only for undergraduates (no separate school like Columbia or Harvard). For western families that wanted daughters to find husbands and receive a solid education from a college that was not super-difficult to get into and wasn't gigantic like Berkeley, USC or Stanford were obvious choices. Stanford's prestige and admissions standards steadily rose after the mid-century as discussed elsewhere, while USC remained in this niche until relatively recently.",

Hopkins, Berkeley, and Cornell had been founded within the previous 35 years. It was accepted that a very wealthy individual could found a university and almost immediately imbue it with prestige with enough money to lure big-name professors.\n\nThat said, Berkeley was clearly the most prestigious university in the western US until the mid-century. /u/TinderForMidgets 's \"just another sleepy regional private university\" is an exaggeration; I think a better way to put it is \"best private university in the west\". I would compare Stanford's national prestige c. 1950 to that of say, Miami today; well known for athletics, and solid but not national-leading undergraduate academics.\n\nWhat changed?\n\n* Stanford benefited as much as any other institution from California's huge post-WW2 boom.\n* The end of free tuition in the UC system post-1970 made Berkeley less of an automatic first choice for California's best students. \n* The 1960s gave Berkeley a national reputation for leftist weirdos that continues today.\n* Silicon Valley, of course. The \"go to Stanford to found a startup\" mentality is a very recent phenomenon, but for decades Stanford has been very, very good at encouraging alumni from Hewlett and Packard onward to donate.",

            "comment": "Stanford has always been prestigious, but the source of prestige in general has changed substantially since the school began. Prior to the 1950s, prestige was generally based on a different set of criteria, mostly surrounding wealth and class. \n\nEssentially only a select group of students from particular feeder schools (wealthy, private, usually racially restrictive and often gender-restrictive) were admitted to most schools like the Ivys until after WWII. That made them prestigious, but mostly by wealth/class and not by research or academic merit the way it\u2019s defined today. Most of the feeders were also relatively local (some exceptions being Princeton taking a lot of students from the South, but mostly east coast serving the east and west coast serving the west), which additionally made most schools and their spheres of influence much more regional than they are today (hence concepts like Stanford of the East and Harvard of the West, which date to the founding of the school). Stanford was generally considered the most prestigious program in the west, and Harvard the most prestigious in the East, without much overlap between regions.\n\nStanford and the UC system led by Berkeley were among the first US universities to implement academically selective admissions based on standardized criteria rather than traditional wealthy feeder schools, which is when the modern idea of selective admissions and academic prestige was popularized. It was adopted subsequently (after contentious debate) by the Ivys and is generally how people view prestige today. At that point they likewise rebranded around merit-based selectivity instead of the orthogonal system of wealth+class (Stanford in contrast attracted many of California\u2019s wealthiest students for many decades, but was always designed to be tuition-free and open to students without means as well).\n\nSo definitely true that mostly a subset of wealthy students went to college until fairly recently, and that selectivity had a very different meaning then. As far as relative prestige, Stanford is younger than many of the institutions with a longer tradition of class-based prestige, but has always been considered exceptional and academically prestigious and has been a top research university since the advent of merit-based selectivity and since the modern post-WWII research university model (pioneered substantially by Stanford under Terman) began to emerge\u2014so effectively since the emergence of what we currently consider selective research universities in the US.\n\nIt\u2019s generally only become more selective and prestigious since then (Silicon Valley and the tech economy from the 1970s to the present have pushed it ahead of schools that might have been comparable before), though the prestige of the Ivys has probably grown also as applicant pools become less regional and selectivities increase. That\u2019s probably also demographic, as Stanford has always been big in CA but CA wasn\u2019t always as central to the US/global economy as it is today (big boost in the 1970s to population and importance in areas like pop culture, trade, and tech); since the \u201870s, semiconductors and tech have become some of the biggest engines of the US/global economy, providing wider national and global prestige and sending Stanford graduates around the world (as well as bringing industries to Silicon Valley in Stanford\u2019s backyard), whereas back in the 1600s-1800s European imperial powers remained more central to the global economy (with schools like Oxford/Cambridge) and much more of the US economy was centered in the East (Princeton for instance derived prestige from much older industries like cotton that drove the economy at the time, which changed after the Civil War and abolition, and as the gold rush and civil war were leading many to move out West instead).\n\nStanford was similarly prestigious in the West at the time (including the 1930s and 40s) and popular among the wealthiest in CA, but the CA economy has quickly grown in size and influence since then, technical aptitude has come to accompany wealth/class as a source of prestige, and that differential is much more in Stanford\u2019s favor now",

Exeter or Andover would be two examples, but there are a number of histories of various colleges that describe their relationships if you\u2019re interested in learning more. Yale alumni mag has one article tracing the roots of their transition from feeders to selective admissions from a broader pool. Alumni felt it would dilute the quality of the applicant pool to recruit more widely, but professors strongly supported the move after a trial period because the applicants they ended up getting were of much higher quality by their assessment when they were assessed more academically and came from a broader pool of schools. Nowadays no more than a dozen at most tend to come from each school per year, but a lot of those schools still attract students who disproportionally pursue a similar path, and are still considered feeders to some extent (though a lot less than in the past, when admissions officers would really only consider applicants from those specific schools)",

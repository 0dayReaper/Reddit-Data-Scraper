As for the exam structure, you can expect a lot of questions under time pressure if Scott is teaching it.\n\nFortunately, Scott\u2019s practice exams are an extremely accurate gauge of performance. My actual exam performance always ended up being within 3-4 points of my practice exam performance.",

I would like to double major in electrical engineering, computer science, or Biomedical engineering and Economics. Which would be the ideal choice. Weather and prestige don't matter to me. What matters most to me is the job prospect.",

Also both have a very different interface with the surrounding community. both also have very different institutional bureaucracies. Finally? The alumni have different views of their school post-graduation and with the alumni community. And the schools interact with alumni very differently. \n\nAll West Coast students should spend time at Harvard. And all East Coast students should spend time at Stanford. \n\nStanford is a true engineering and CS school.\n\nHarvard economics is unparalleled \n\nBiomedical research: Harvard &gt; Stanford",

The largest distinction I felt is the Harvard network feels much more international while the Stanny network more dense in the west coast. Of course there are exceptions blah blah blah but if you\u2019re an international student that might make a meaningful difference.\n\nMy 92 year old grandmother who lives abroad knows Harvard and has no idea what Stanford is.

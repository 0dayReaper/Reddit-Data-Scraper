    "postText": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m an upcoming freshman who\u2019s super excited about Stanford.\n\nMy question is, how hard is it to find a professor to do research under as an undergrad in EE or CS? If anyone has experience getting that kind of position, how did you get it? Cold mail? School resources? Also, I saw that there were some summer research positions for undergrads. Does anyone have experience with those?",

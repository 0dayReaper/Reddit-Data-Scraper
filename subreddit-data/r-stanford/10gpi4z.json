            "comment": "If you go to the west stacks in green library, you will notice that each floor of the stacks has a central set of stairs. If you move away from the stairs to either the left or to the right all the way to the end of the floor (until you meet a wall) there will be a desk, chair, power point, window, and lamp. These spaces are usually vacant, as are the stacks themselves as there is ittle need for srudents to go there, and the lights are motion sensor activated so if you entered by accident you would be forgiven for thinking the floors are not meant to be used. You may need to experiment with which floor of the stacks has wifi reliable enough for your exam. I used to use the top floor of the stacks, but have not gone there for a long time as I usually use my room for these things.\n\nThere are other places in Green as well as in Huang or Gates that are technically accessible but rarely used and not well known.",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a CC students who\u2019s looking to transfer, and I was wondering what the mental health situation is like at Stanford. I\u2019ve heard that writing about mental health issues can be an \u201canti-hook\u201d to AOs, but I\u2019ve heard of people that wrote about their struggles and go in just fine, and a lot of people have told me that it really depends on the culture/vibe around the school (think cornell vs a school like ASU), and I just wanted to get a general idea. Thanks!",

I'm super sensitive to other people's emotions and the general atmosphere of communities. i leave as often as I can.",

Of course, as an alum, I imagine my perspective is also skewed towards the happier students since the unhappy students are less likely to seek out alumni or be involved in programs that interact with alumni.  Reality probably sits somewhere in the middle.",

I think Reddit still under-represents the mental health issues we have at Stanford, especially in comparison to other college subreddits. The depressed people I was referring to are all people I know irl. I too often think people at Stanford are happy, but that's until I get to know them deeper. I will admit that my circle irl maybe over-represents fli/bipoc/lgbt+ people, but only slightly. Even in my circles where people seem to be functioning on a higher level and are more privileged or \"normal\" (i.e., my classes, dorms), I have deeper convos with them and find out this is not the case. \n\nI can't say what it's like in your circles, like the culture around sharing about mental health issues, but there's a chance that you may just not know if you never really make the effort to find out.",

I don't think it's a matter of repelling or attracting based on your emotional disposition. I think people who are similar to one another tend to stick together.

Asians with other Asians. etc. Most of the people around me are BIPOC/FLI/lgbt+ and I don't talk to many men (and men tend to be less mentally ill). \n\nTo be clear, I really hope the mental health situation at Stanford isn't as bad as it seems to me. I really want you to be right. I would love to meet people who are happy and satisfied. It's a huge burden being around so much darkness.

In high school I will say that mental illnesses tended to be distributed quite evenly throughout different social groups with the exception of like the drug dealer friend groups ofc. And that there are content and unhappy people in all circles that I've seen my parents in. \n\nThough this may not be your intention, the rhetoric that mentally ill people \"drag\" others down or are palpably unhappy to the point of repelling content people can be harmful. Most of the time you can't tell how content/mentally ill people are. I know people who are very successful/popular around campus as well as people who are really struggling socially/academically and I know that they all suffer. Also, equating happiness/contendedness to lack of mental health problems is imperfect in itself. I am very content with my life and very grateful. I'm not going around 24/7 complaining about things. On the other hand, I know people who always complain/are dissatisfied with their lives but can't be diagnosed with any mental health issues.",

I was under the impression that many pumps aren't working / have been taken down recently, would appreciate some pointers before I go on a campus-wide hunt!\n\n[https://transportation.stanford.edu/bicycle/gear-and-tune/bike-safety-repair-stands](https://transportation.stanford.edu/bicycle/gear-and-tune/bike-safety-repair-stands)",

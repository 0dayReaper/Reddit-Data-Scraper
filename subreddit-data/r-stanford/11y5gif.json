    "postText": "Hi! I was recently admitted to the MSCS program and have some questions for current grad students about the ability to work while in the program and how many units are normal for one to take:\n\n1. Are you able to work (at least part-time) while in the program? If so, how many hours do you work and how many units do you take per quarter?\n\n2. If you don\u2019t work, how many units do you take per quarter?\n\n3. Is it easy to find an on-campus job?\n\n4. If you have a TA/RAship, does it cover your tuition for the quarter?\n\nAs you can probably tell, I am worried about being able to afford tuition and living expenses but I still want to have a balanced course load. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! :) Thanks!",

            "comment": "Current MS in CS student here.\n\n1. If you mean working for Stanford in an on-campus capacity (i.e., the library, cafe etc.), then I certainly believe so. Related to your question #4, you can see the 2022-23 salary schedule for TA/CA/RAs here: [link](https://gfs.stanford.edu/salary/salary23/salary_tables.pdf)\n2. Being a private tutor to local students can be quite lucrative as well. If you're not familiar with the Bay Area, Atherton, Menlo Park and Palo Alto are all very wealthy cities with many parents who would be eager to pay top dollar for a Stanford grad student to tutor their children in CS, mathematics etc. For example, I personally know a Stanford undergrad who was making $100/hr to provide college essay brainstorming, editing and feedback services to a parent who had a child applying to college.\n3. Many of my classmates seem to take between 8 - 10 units per quarter (roughly 2-3 classes). I would say 3 advanced CS classes can be quite challenging to balance, especially if you are taking classes that can be quite notorious for their workload.\n   1. You will soon be able to access a tool called Carta ([website](https://carta.stanford.edu/)). This is an internal Stanford tool built by students that essentially formats and presents the course feedback data that you have to submit each quarter in a pretty way. Think of it as an internal Yelp for Stanford classes. You can use this to see what others have said about a course, what their time allocation was, and what their opinion of the teaching staff was.\n\nSoon, you'll also be invited to a Slack with MS in CS students, where you can get some more ideas or answers to your questions.\n\nWelcome to The Farm!",

            "comment": "1. If you want to work then you should consider HCP, which allows you to study part-time and work full-time. This is only worth it if you have tuition assistance, IMO, because of the opportunity cost associated with delaying your degree.\n\n\n\n2. Most take 8-12. Stanford lets you choose to do 3 or 4 credits for many intro courses so it varies. 2-3 classes will be more than enough. Go easy your first quarter. \n\n\n3. TAs aren\u2019t easy to find, but you can find one. They cover tuition for 8-10 credits and provide a stipend of $10k/quarter. Check the CS department website. They have a page for TAs. RAs are hard to find for MS students.",

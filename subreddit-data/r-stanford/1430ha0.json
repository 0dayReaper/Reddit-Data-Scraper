I like philosophy a lot and submitted an art portfolio to Stanford, but I am also really interested in STEM. Would either of these still be a good fit for me?\n\nAdditionally, does sle/italic isolate you from the rest of the Stanford community, or is it easy to still interact with people who are not artists/philosophers?",

I also enjoyed all the field trip opportunities (for performances, galleries, and I think they did an annual trip to LA, not sure if that\u2019s still a thing.)\n\nI don\u2019t think it felt isolated from the rest of Stanford. A lot of people in ITALIC were stem majors, had friends outside of ITALIC, joined various clubs and groups, took other classes. \n\nThe dorm is Burbank in Stern, with the new residential neighborhood system, that might be something to consider for how it will impact your housing options in future years.",

    "postText": "Hello, PhD student from Poland here. In one month I will come to Stanford for a month research stay and I am having some doubts regarding paying issues. I mean, what kind of payment card should I use? I was warned that debit cards from Polish banks (Visa, MasterCard) don't work in California, but credit cards do work. It's that true European debit cards don't work? Do you have some experience with that? I mean, if there are some newcomers, of course. What about other ways of paying, like Revolut or whatever?",

However to be safe bring a credit card too, those work for sure.\nAs someone said you can also open an account at the Stanford credit union (but probably not worth it for just one month)!",

Also, if you\u2019re coming as a visiting researcher I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019d qualify to open an SFCU account. Easiest path that I see is to get a travel card from your bank in your home country. You can preload it with USD (and you\u2019d typically get a favorable exchange rate than using a credit card) and use it like a debit card when you\u2019re here.",

I would stay away from macro and focus on  heavy quantitative micro, game theory and econometric classes. You will be limited in these three areas if you are only \u201cgood\u201d in math. All will help you in MS&amp;E. \n\nAnother level of decision is how far to push. Bs with maybe future MBA or BS+MS+MBA or PhD.\n\nGood luck. If you want the rigor it will be there, though perhaps not presented on a silver platter. Econ 1 is largely a waste of a class in all US universities. The best Taylor could do is to teach what is not in his textbook. I took him 40 years ago (yikes!).",

Would you recommend a more mathematical micro econ focus if I intend to work in finance (more traditional east coast IB or consulting and not tech consulting)? Or would it be relatively the same as taking mostly macro courses?\n\nI think I\u2019m more interested in macro courses, but also understand that for my career goals micro courses might be more useful. Basically - If I plan on going into finance and coterming in a stem field, should I split my Econ courses 50/50 between macro and micro or do primarily micro?",

But not so much as to be pigeonholed and be seen to compete with the true quants, PhD\u2019s in math. Hence by original question. \n\nI think an underutilized pathway is that which is more qualitative and research driven. \n\nToo many students from elite schools waste their four years of coursework and their free time. \n\nHarvard does a better job. Most of the better Econ undergrads finish their coursework after three years and spend their forth writing a thesis with the goal of magma or better (Kind of like being an editor for the law review pre 90s when only the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me were selected on grades alone). \n\nWhat is hard and the quintessential tease of life is that when you are my age it is so much clearer as to what were optimal pathways of success versus what was being pitched. \n\nYou need to leave space to figure out you. The optimal design of 12 quarters of courses is only half the game. Find yourself. \n\nI think there is are three bridges between self discovery and your curriculum. One is the internship. Another is independent research. And the third is the exogenous shock of the random course with the brilliant professor who rips open your soul to transform it. You need to spend as much time on the first two and allow for the magic of the third as on majors and course selection which are after all endogenous to the system before you. \n\nOk. Old guy blabbering over. Managerial science is about decision making. Thus is the heart of microeconomics and quite frankly economics itself. You need to understand strategic behavior, agency, and institutions, the latter of which should be found in quantitative sociology were sociology not so destroyed by politics. \n\nData and how to make sense of it is not such stats but econometrics which if properly done is couched in behavioral models. Blind application of stats in economics is virtually useless, a critique that applies to older econometric work. \n\nYour first rigorous financial theory will be straight out of micro theory (think Varian). \n\nMacro. I love it. Every macroeconomist today needed more micro and econometrics. \nBut quite frankly the fiends are orthogonal to your stated interests in MS&amp;E and CS.  Be careful, once you taste from its fruit, it will be hard to go back. 1/1000th the jobs. \n\nSo there you have it. The advice I would give to my son were he to ask the same questions. \n\nBut it all starts from you and yours wants!",

(I'm not trying to flex or humblebrag, just telling you the truth.) \n\nWith regards to your question: yes, most of the Econ classes I took (maybe all of them... it's been awhile) are/were taught by actual professors. You can deduce this by just looking at the course catalog (Google).\n\nNotably, John Taylor still teaches Econ 1... and he is widely considered to be a future potential Nobel laureate. I would strongly suggest taking his class even if you've already taken AP Econ.",

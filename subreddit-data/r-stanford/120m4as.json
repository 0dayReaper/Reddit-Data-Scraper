    "postText": "Hi I'm an undergraduate from India visiting Stanford for a summer internship june-aug at a lab in the medical school. I was not sure where I can look for housing that is affordable. The summer housing provided by Stanford/airbnb is around 3000 a month whereas it is much lesser for stanford students (around 1500 ?). I saw FB groups but they don't seem legit. I would be grateful for any help. I'm happy to share details about me or answer questions if anyone here is looking to sublet too!\n\nI dont have a Stanford email yet and am in the process of obtaining one. But I believe I would get it closer to my joining date June 1 which is too late to book housing.\n\nThe funding im getting would allow me to spend around 2500-3000 per month for all expenses including living, food and personal.",

What you really need is a proxy who can view rooms in person and rent for you. Most people still find roommates on Craigslist still, but also a bunch of scams there. I see nicely priced rooms on [https://supost.com/](https://supost.com/) but you might need a Stanford email?   \nMessage me, I'll send you the info if you can't see posts there. You should also be able to get a temporary supost login if you email someone over at housing... I found out who to contact for that when I was accepted. Search around. I might be thinking of another housing site tho..\n\nRent is just insane in California. Unfortunately, paying about $1000-$1500 for a room to rent is going to be a deal you want to take.\n\nYes, it's incredible that our real estate landlord cosplaying as a university can't house its own students for a reasonable price. I find it hilarious that I'm supposed to feel grateful that they give me a scholarship just to pay themselves an exorbitant amount of rent. Thank you, and you're welcome? I'm sorry things are this way and hope you have a great summer!!",

I did check out SUpost but it seems that the rooms on campus being sublet are not for undergraduates. I shall look at rooms that are not on campus but I am not sure if they're legit. Unfortunately I do not know anyone in Stanford who would be a proxy for me.  \n\n\nIt's really disappointing to know that Stanford has such extortionate pricing for its own students  \n\n\nThanks again!",

    "postText": "**TLDR: Can I do a Master's in the EE program while working with AA (Aeronautics and Astronautics) professors in their labs? The EE program coursework options are much better for me, while AA  professors/labs are more relevant to my interests). Bonus: Is it weird/bad to mention specifically AA labs and professors in my SOP when applying to the EE program?**\n   \n  \nHi, I'm currently applying for a Master's in Electrical Engineering in order to pursue Robotics work in the area of navigation/localization. Having considered the CS, EE, and AA (Aeronautics and Astronautics) programs, I found that the EE department works the best for me coursework-wise - all three of those departments have courses I wish to take, and the EE department offers the best flexibility/freedom to take many electives from other departments, while the base EE coursework is also very relevant to my interests.  \n  \nHowever, some of the labs/professors I am most interested in - in particular the NAVlab and ARL are both in the AA dept. As far as I can tell - I am fine to be in the EE program but work in the AA labs (Navlab is less of a problem because the head professor is also in EE by courtesy, but the question stands for the others). However, general confirmation (or more information on how this works) that I understand this correctly would be appreciated. I also want to mention these AA professors and labs in my SOP essay and would like to know if it would be bad to do so, considering they are not in the EE dept which I am applying to.",

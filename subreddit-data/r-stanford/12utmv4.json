    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming graduate student. Would like to know how the 3b1b or 4b2b housing situation works. Does it become too crowded? Is sharing a bathroom too much of an inconvenience? Is it really worth spending a couple hundred bucks extra for a 2b2b or 2b1b type housing? My goal is to be as economical as possible. At the same time, I don\u2019t want to spend too much energy on potential inter-housemate conflicts. Would love to hear current or past student experiences. Thanks in advance!",

Apparently the bedrooms vary in size and are assigned by housing so you could end up with a tiny bedroom for the same price as your roommate in a big bedroom.\n\nMy son lives in EVGR 2b2b Junior and it is really nice! He has friends in the EVGR 2b2b full size and said the bedroom is bigger and the kitchen area is bigger and has a couch but not worth $300 more per month.  Comparing the EVGR 2b2b junior to Escondido low rise 2b1b definitely worth the extra $29 per month.\n\nPay attention to the square footage listed in the housing brochure. For example, EVGR 2b2b Junior (and Kennedy 2b2b Junior) are about 670 sq ft total or 335 per person.  Escondido 3b1b low rise is 800 which is 267 per person. Rains 4b2b -- 1000 total but that's only 250 per person.\n\nYou didn't say if you are PhD or MS student or if you are funded (TA/CA). If you are a PhD student you will be able to renew your housing so you might want to take that into consideration as well (i.e., rank based on where you think you might want to live for multiple years).\n\nHousing is assigned by lottery but incoming students have high priority so you should have a pretty good chance of getting your top ranked choices.",

I've had a one bathroom situation, but it was with family. Still there is conflict when there is urgency involved.",

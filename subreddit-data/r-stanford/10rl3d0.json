It\u2019s a quite large sum of money that\u2019s available so I was thinking on looking for summer courses out of state that may be worth the trip.\n\nHave you taken summer courses at a different university while being enrolled in a different one? Do you know how it\u2019s like at Stanford?",

Campus is super quiet during the summer. \n\nIf you have a sponsor and have a research opportunity lined up, that\u2019s a different story.",

    "postText": "My partner and I are hoping to be able to sublet our graduate housing over the summer. I know that Stanford only allows graduate students to sublet their on-campus apartments to non-undergrad Stanford affiliates. Thus, I'm curious, who is there even left to sublet to? The only group of such Stanford affiliates that I can think of that might be looking for temporary summer housing is visiting researchers? \n\nP.S. if anyone is looking for a sublet feel free to DM me!",

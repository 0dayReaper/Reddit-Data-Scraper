Kicking people off campus will put them at more risk of contracting covid, not less.",

At last check, Stanford has a [.33% positivity rate for covid](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2021/12/13/university-reports-27-new-student-covid-19-cases/). The entire campus is near 99%. vaxed and will likely have boosters soon, meaning even those who get COVID will have minor symptoms. Giving this much advance warning does provide transparency, but it also increases the likelihood that students will change their flights (flights will be much cheaper if you fly back mid January than over the holiday break; they'll get to spend more time with family), keeping students in more covid risky areas than Stanford and basically delaying, not avoiding, what will likely be a spike in covid cases when everyone returns. I've already had two friends text me saying they wana get a place in Tahoe the first two weeks of school. Needless to say, this is a bad decision, one made out of an irrational fear of something that Stanford is clearly not yet comfortable living with. At what point will they be? Cause this virus isn't going away. Omicron will mutate in Pi, then into Rho, then into Sigma, then into blah blah blah. Like, at what point do we take precautions and soldier through instead of shutting shit down and running around flailing our hands in the air in fear? Needless to say, I'm a little steamed at the moment.",

There's no way people fly in on the 2nd, get tested and cleared for Jan 3rd classes, thus chaos. Some students flying internationally have to quarantine (or is it 2 negative tests 5 days apart?)  so they would also likely miss the first week of class. \n\nEverything I've read is that it's about maintaining the existing guidelines for testing and realizing that many students won't have green passes in Health Check to get into buildings.  \n\nAlso, because they aren't reporting test results over the break, we won't know if there's a steep increase until *after* we return. \n\nAs for flights, you can probably get away with a flight that first week, but you have to be back in time to do tests AND get results. My test this week took \\~40 hours to get results, fwiw.",

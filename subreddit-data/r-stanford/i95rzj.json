    "postText": "From: Persis Drell [persis@stanford.edu](mailto:persis@stanford.edu)\n\nDear Faculty Colleagues,  \n\nYou will shortly receive a message from the President announcing our decision not to bring frosh, sophomores and incoming transfer students to campus for a residential autumn quarter, as we had hoped.  As you know, we had been planning to have these undergraduate cohorts back this fall for an in-person residential experience. As you will see in the President\u2019s letter, we have been closely monitoring the continued spread of COVID-19 and the reversal of the state\u2019s reopening plans due to public health conditions. The recent state guidance for higher education to curtail the spread of COVID-19, which we fully support, prohibits most indoor classes while our county is still on the \u201cwatch list,\u201d and it includes other restrictions on activities that would make for a very limiting on-campus undergraduate experience this fall.   Graduate students and professional school students will still be welcomed to campus, as will the approximately 800 undergraduates from all classes with special circumstances who have petitioned to come to campus and whose petitions have been granted. Further communications around planning for the year to come will follow over the next few days. We will continue to plan for bringing undergraduates back in winter, spring and summer quarters, assuming public health conditions allow, in a manner that supports our community\u2019s safety and a robust undergraduate experience. I want to take this moment to thank all of you for the tremendous efforts you have been putting in to plan the next academic year, and a special thanks to those of you who had volunteered to teach in person for the fall. Today\u2019s announcement will probably not be the last change of plans that we will have to make as we face this extraordinary year. While we strive to teach our students and engage with our research, we are having to reinvent much of what we do to meet the challenges presented by the circumstances of the pandemic.  I am deeply grateful for all of your unflagging efforts to support our mission in these unprecedented times.\n\nPersis",

In my case, pursuing my PhD is literally doing biomedical research for the university - not necessarily taking coursework. Because of this weird employment/student hybrid status we have, the university has effectively become a permanent residence for many graduate students. This can be especially the case in STEM research where we need physical laboratories to do work, though of course many other PhDs need campus resources to perform their research as well.",

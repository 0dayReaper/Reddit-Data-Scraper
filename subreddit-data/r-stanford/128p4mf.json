But seeing all of these articles about how it\u2019s an institution that hates fun has me seriously considering if it\u2019s a place I want to spend four years. Do you think administration will begin to ease the restrictions due to the negative attention, or do you think this is how Stanford\u2019s gonna stay for awhile?",

I will continue to advocate for Stanford because of the incredibly diverse group of students they admit every year, and due to campus size/isolation/location, you\u2019ll spend a lot of time with your peers and form life long connections. These are invaluable, and worth more than any party. \n\nBut yes, I think the party scene is fucked.",

Keep in mind that the media are incentivised to blow things out of proportion as well. \n\nAnecdotally, frosh coming in the fall tend to be the most amped about parties, and more realistically, the alcohol that is inevitably present. Then Fall quarter happens, \"transports\" happen, people vomit all over the place (sometimes too close to home), folks realise the stench of these parties often breaks the Geneva convention, and many find other things to do with their time. \n\nThat being said, there are people who still go to these parties regardless of the smell, and the mess, and the raucousness - and who have great fun! I wouldn't worry too much, just make a friend or two in some frats, tag along, and you'll have a blast! \n\nA note, though, on the current administration, including MTL: they are widely disliked, yes, but it doesn't really matter. Most things are great, here. Can't say that's true everywhere. \n\nDo I wish the party scene was better? Yes. Do I wish admin was better? Yes. Would I go anywhere else for uni because of it? Heck no.",

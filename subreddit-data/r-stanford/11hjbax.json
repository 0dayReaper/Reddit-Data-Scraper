I really want to do 106L, 192 , and 45 though cause they seem like interesting, useful, yet manageable classes. As for math 20, I realized halfway through 51 that I wasn\u2019t ready for such a jump and needed to brush up on my math. Also heard integral rules are used in 109 which I lowkey forgot. I have the credits for the 19/20/21 series. Open to suggestions for things to self-study over the summer or online community college too. Thanks!",

That way, you can practice Leetcode over the summer and try your hand at the internship job market next fall. \n\nI would also re-vamp most of the schedule - CS 45, Stats 32, CS 106L, CME 192/193 are all empty/useless classes. It's never a good idea to take classes dedicated to a single programming language, you learn the language-specific mechanics on the job/applying languages to concepts anyways.",

I put the on campus stuff at the top of my rank list, and I took the time to rank every single one of the options (40 something at the time iirc). I think the one I got was roughly halfway down my list, in one of the off campus apartments. \n\nWasn\u2019t exactly what I wanted but it was fine. I had a car already so transportation wasn\u2019t an issue.",

I can talk about the process.\n\nThe priority is mainly listed here: [https://rde.stanford.edu/studenthousing/assignment-guarantee-and-priorities](https://rde.stanford.edu/studenthousing/assignment-guarantee-and-priorities). New grad students are guaranteed housing if they\n\n1. Apply by the deadline\n2. Accept any option\\* given by R&amp;DE (there are some technicalities, see link)\n\nMoreover, if you have housing in the first year and have medium priority (for doctoral students), you're generally guaranteed housing if you stay in the same place. Transfers to other dorms are not guaranteed though.\n\nFrom what I've heard, if you're not applying with an existing roommate getting EVGR is kind of 50-50, but other dorms are nice too.",

I have guaranteed and high priority housing, but I wanna know how much my priority will truly help me in the lottery",

They generally just go down the list, though once you get an assignment you\u2019ll probably be able to renew indefinitely as long as your priority remains (possibly afterwards though it\u2019s not technically guaranteed). If you really don\u2019t like your assignment, you can apply to reassign, which is on a first-come basis as new assignments open up through the rest of the year. Assignments depend on popularity and demand, but most of the time you\u2019ll get something you\u2019re pretty happy with, especially if your priority is high",

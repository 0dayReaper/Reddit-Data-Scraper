    "postText": "How hard is it to get an A+ in 106b? How many people do they usually give that grade to? I'm taking it this quarter and was wondering what I'd have to do for it. My workload is not much right now and I feel like I can give more time to 106b and go the extra mile but I don't know how, or whether hoping for an A+ is even feasible.",

You can never study enough when you\u2019re trying to max out on a test.",

Try playing before 3pm during the week, and you can probably just walk onto any court. Taube South and West Campus are both really nice, but I haven\u2019t been to West Campus in a while. I think some of the West Campus courts are damaged from the storms.",

Doesn\u2019t hurt to try to find an open court, worst case is that someone shows up and tells you they have the court reserved. \n\nThere are also some courts on campus that don\u2019t have reservations. I used to play at a small set of courts near the EV grad student housing complex, but that was a long time ago. Not sure if they\u2019re still there.",

I think you need to sign up for the tennis courts online through the recreational website and it\u2019s only for Stanford affiliated students and community members With a valid SUID.\n\nhttps://rec.stanford.edu/locations/rentals-and-reservations\n\nThe Mitchell Park tennis courts is public and you have to make a reservation thru the city of Palo Alto. There is a small fee. \n\nIt all has to do with liability. Good luck!",

I try to prioritize having at least one day off each week and some hours to play/rest on one weekday evening, but anything more than that puts me underwater. With only one extracurricular on top of school, I don\u2019t have time to workout, explore career opportunities, or utilize many other campus/community resources. Have definitely reconstructed what \u201cperforming well\u201d is, but I\u2019m jaded and overwhelmed yfm?",

            "comment": "A few things that have helped me:\n\n- Where allowed, **find study/homework groups**. This really cuts back on wasted pset time where I tell myself \"oh, it'll be better if I solve this problem entirely by myself\", rather than first taking an honest stab at a solution then talking over approaches with someone. Knowing in advance that I will be discussing the work with a peer means I won't feel \"trapped\" in finishing the pset that particular night. This also helps me _actually_ learn the material instead of getting a 0 from a TA without any feedback.\n- Be honest with yourself about **distractions** (this Chrome extension really helps with this: [Pause \u2013 Stop Mindless Browsing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pause-stop-mindless-brows/ljfdccdjpfjpfjbpdiihanpodilolofh))\n- Using a **light run** as a healthy distraction instead of Reddit + YouTube. They usually clear my head and make me look forward to coming back to work. And I'm really talking about a *light run*, that way you don't resent running too :)\n- As you've said, try to take the **entirety of Saturday or Sunday off** (at least one\u2014although this can be tough). This gives me time to recharge and makes sure I don't resent my work by the time I get back to it.\n- One thing that overwhelms me is the mountain of emails and little things I have to do; what really helps me here is to use **Google Tasks** integrated into Gmail. This way, when I get an email either 1) I immediately respond or 2) I turn it into a Task and archive it out of my inbox. Then I have all of my tasks I can refer back to (especially when I'm procrastinating bigger tasks I tend to look down my list to see if I can knock off something small, yet important). This is helpful when juggling life + school tasks too. BTW, you can integrate your @stanford email into Gmail, which helps to manage your personal emails with school emails.\n- Plan everything (within reason) on **Google calendar**. That way you don't have to hold everything in memory and can rely on just checking your days/weeks schedule. This is also something I've done to plan our my coursework + research for *every quarter* ahead of time in **Google sheets** (that one is a little more time consuming but it gives you a bird's-eye view of what to expect during each quarter, and makes sure you're getting the right requirements / pre-reqs before taking harder classes)\n- Letting myself stop working if I'm stuck or frustrated and just **go to sleep**. I used to grind psets until they were finished (resulting in many 5-6 am nights), but once I switched my attitude to allow myself to sleep and revisit in the morning, I've noticed\u2014on countless occasions\u2014I come back to the work in the morning and immediately solve what I was stuck on for an embarrassing amount of time the night before.\n\n**The upshot is this**: work with others who are also probably burning out (especially now when we're all mostly in isolation), planning out my time reduced my anxiety (although it may seem like a daunting task itself), organizing my tasks and emails puts my current work into perspective, going for a light run can be used as a mental tool, and allowing myself to rest all *tremendously* changed my attitude and productivity while at Stanford.",

Only relying on OH to talk through stuff or just going about it on my own didn\u2019t work for me; my grades, sleep, and understanding all started to increase substantially after I started being a bit more social with my academics. The only caveat I\u2019d say is to make sure you don\u2019t become reliant on those who you study with to spoon feed you the answers, the dynamic works best when you\u2019re working on equal levels",

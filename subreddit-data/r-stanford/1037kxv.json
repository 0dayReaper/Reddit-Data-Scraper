    "postText": "I\u2019m a junior trying to take the MCAT this summer but I haven\u2019t taken orgo or biochem yet. I know there\u2019s essentially no overlap between the two so I think it would be helpful to take biochem now so I don\u2019t have to send study it. Problem is that chem 121 is a hard code prereq for 141 and I haven\u2019t even taken 33 yet. Anyone know if it\u2019s possible to get around this/who I could talk to?",

You might be a beast at chemistry though so in that case do as you please. Worst case you drop the class you don\u2019t need for the MCAT (171) during week 3. \n\nAlso in my opinion i found the material from the MCAT study book to be more straightforward and applicable to the MCAT than what i learned in 33/121/etc",

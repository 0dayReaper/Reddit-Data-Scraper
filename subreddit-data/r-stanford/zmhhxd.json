So people are digging.\nFrom Ashlee Vance\u2019s 2015 biography of Musk:\n\n\u201c\u201d\u201dWhile playing detective, O\u2019Reilly unearthed some information about Musk\u2019s past that\u2019s arguably more interesting than the allegations in the lawsuit. He found that the University of Pennsylvania granted Musk\u2019s degrees in 1997\u2014two years later than what Musk has cited. I called Penn\u2019s registrar and verified these findings. Copies of Musk\u2019s records show that he received a dual degree in economics and physics in May 1997. O\u2019Reilly also subpoenaed the registrar\u2019s office at Stanford to verify Musk\u2019s admittance in 1995 for his doctorate work in physics. \u201cBased on the information you provided, we are unable to locate a record in our office for Elon Musk,\u201d wrote the director of graduate admissions. When asked during the case to produce a document verifying Musk\u2019s enrollment at Stanford, Musk\u2019s attorney declined and called the request \u201cunduly burdensome.\u201d I contacted a number of Stanford physics professors who taught in 1995, and they either failed to respond or didn\u2019t remember Musk. Doug Osheroff, a Nobel Prize winner and department chair at the time, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I knew Elon, and am pretty sure that he was not in the Physics Department.\u201d\n\nIn the years that have followed, Musk\u2019s enemies have been quick to bring up the ambiguities around his admission to Stanford.\u201d\u201d\u201d",

I dont think it matters, he did not receive anything from the University, so to me it is rather ridiculous to even state that. If I join the marines and quit after the first day of bootcamp it doesnt make me one, does it?",

            "comment": "This discussion shows why conspiracy theories are so easy to start. \n\nStep 1: take a school with a long history in executing pivotal research for decades. Stanford is a great one for this. From SRI forming from it, to Zimbardo\u2019s prison experiment, to major startups (google, Cisco, cromemco etc) coming from it, Stanford students and faculty and alumni have  impacted society.\n\nStep 2: have people who are used to the military \u201corders come from the top\u201d or just straightforward employment \u201cthe CEO gives the orders\u2026\u201d think about Stanford, and they will assume the university runs the same way. The president, with the faculty senate, MUST be directing these world-changing activities. Because all these people know is the orders in their world always come from the top. IN PARTICULAR, people outside academia don\u2019t understand a professor\u2019s job is to shill for research dollars to fund programs and education in their department, which means the donors - often corporations or government-have a significant role in deciding what gets done.\n\nSo\u2026 you get people thinking that somehow Stanford is involved in FTX, maybe even directing its actions as a \u201cgrand plan of establishing crypto dominance\u201d when quite likely, there was no engagement between FTX and Stanford other than parents who happen to get a Stanford paycheck supporting their kid. Further, lawyers usually have little clue how to run a business. So I would guess SBF\u2019s parents\u2019 involvement was limited to \u201csave your receipts, dear, and get a good accountant to do your taxes\u201d\n\nOf course, the justice department will investigate. They HAVE TO.  Because maybe the parents were involved! But I\u2019d be surprised if the dynamics were anything different than a kid starting a business, making some mistakes, some unethical choices (perhaps unethical enough to be criminal ones) and the house of cards from those sleazy acts falling down NOW because the crypto crash exposes houses of cards. What makes SBF different I believe is not the core criminal acts. It\u2019s the huge $ amount involved. But at the heart, FTX was simply a sleazy business.",

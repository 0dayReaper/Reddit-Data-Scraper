    "postText": "First, I\u2019m well aware of the population of Reddit - I\u2019ve been on the internet a long time - and I know this post is likely going to be unpopular. *I don't care.*\n\nBut I do have a question that is really bothering the hell out of me.  \n**What in the world do people think a diversity, equity, and inclusion professional should do?**\n\nI finally decided to listen to the full audio of the Judge Duncan event. (Can anyone send me the video?) It confirmed what I thought happened in the 10-minute video. \n\nDean Steinbach did deliver remarks, and after she did so, the protestors left, and the event continued without the speech-drowning heckling. After the majority of people left, Duncan engaged with the remaining dissenting students, which was his choice, and they replied. Did he expect to ask them \u201cWhen did I do that?\u201d and they remain silent? They even tried to placate his temper tantrum *multiple times* and calm him down, telling him to finish his speech and stop engaging with them! Practically begged him, but he was too immature to do so. Rather than finish his prepared remarks, he *chose* to go straight to a Q&amp;A, so he could engage with those people. No one forced him to do that...\n\nSteinbach did her job. She had the backs of those who have a harder time finding diversity, equity, and inclusion on a college campus. She made them feel heard and welcomed on campus. And she deescalated the situation, so much so that the majority of protestors *left* immediately after she finished, and he was given space to continue his speech, which he declined to take by his own choice. \n\nWhy is it anyone else\u2019s fault this grown man and public servant had a tantrum?\n\nWhy is she fired? What do people think Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is? \n\nIs it to make white \\[straight, cis..\\] people feel more included? So they can feel safer? Why does *anybody* think she works for the students in the majority populations, who don\u2019t feel inequities in their daily lives, who see people who look like them on campus regularly, who already feel included on this campus? \n\nAnd how does anyone gloss over the fact that that assumption she owes anything to those people\u2014forced to sacrifice the needs of diverse students\u2014only promotes the continuation of oppression and the myth of white supremacy? \n\nIs this not exactly why we need this position? Because there is an inequity\u2026 *She does not owe equal energy to people who do not experience inequity.* Her job is to fill that gap, not keep it open\u2026\n\nShe spoke to the students she was hired to speak to. She took care of the students she was hired to take care of. Just as Dean Steinbach said, how the hell do people think this works **in practice?** It\u2019s hard, messy, and uncomfortable. Do people think dismantling over 130 years of colonial white supremacy\u2014on this campus alone\u2014would be anything less? Or is the actual intent to just distract and deflect from doing just that...\n\nThe demand that a DEI Dean\u2014and a Black woman\u2014be responsible for a white man's lack of emotional maturity is incredible but predictable. Frankly, the demand that she is apparently supposed to caretake a grown man and a federal judge's fragile emotions like she is his mother is misogynoir. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m disgusted by this school after the firing of Dean Steinbach, which nearly immediately followed the rescinding of the Harmful Language List. Why we are making our University policies based on Fox News criticism is beyond me. Who cares? We're *Stanford*.   \nThis school answers to its students, not the media.\n\nDiversifying our campuses is not enough. Inviting students to a racist, bigoted campus to make you look good (diversity rationale) is not morally acceptable. The university has a responsibility to create an environment that is safe for students to learn in. They are doing the exact opposite. \n\nA side note: Please do not speak about the First Amendment if you don\u2019t know what the hell it is. Google it. Retake high school U.S. History. Watch a YouTube video. IDC, but don\u2019t bother me.. \n\nI leave you all with this quote from my favorite scholarly article, \u201cReframing the Affirmative Action Debate To Move Beyond Arguments For Diversity And Interest Convergence,\u201d by Adrian Jamal McLain and Steven L. Nelson, bold emphasis added:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The diversity rationale, as implemented by the white masses, aims to erase Black suffering by choosing to focus on the individual rather than our group experience. **This explains white people\u2019s increased need to claim and pursue diversity. As long as white people can boast and define the parameters of the term, they own it.** What cannot be forgotten is that racial identities are a product of white supremacist ideology. Moreover, Black people and, to that extent, diversity are under attack by whiteness. As our American society grows less white, **white people have colonized the term diversity.** **It is now being used as a co-opting tool to promote colorblind ideologies.** As the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019s embrace on diversity grows tighter, diversity as acknowledged in traditionally white institutions as colorblindness remains at the core of American educational culture. This is true in instances of white people\u2019s efforts at overt racism and more broadly, liberal white agendas that embrace abstract liberalism, or **the notion that one can espouse liberal ideologies while rejecting any and all concrete applications of those same liberal ideologies.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[...\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Furthermore, **Black students are wanted at traditionally white institutions so that the schools may fulfill abstractly liberal criteria for obtaining and retaining diverse student populations where the interests of white people are prioritized, promoted, and achieved. Simultaneously, however, the interests of Black students are marginalized, shunted, or otherwise ignored. Diversity without social justice on college campuses, as seen through whiteness as a critical theory, is a diluted term meant to maintain rather than transform organizational norms and values that have kept systemic inequalities strong.**",

There's seems to be an attempt to draw parallels to the protests against Yiannopoulos, citing it as some [kind of terrorism](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/conservative-judges-extend-clerk-boycott-stanford-after-disrupted-speech-2023-04-03/), despite no violence taking place.\n\nIt's a common conservative theme to criticize methodology, but it's a bad faith argument. BLM protests were unacceptable due to violence, but so was Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem. The only \"appropriate\" method of protest seems to be embracing existing power structures and deferring to those in control so as not to be a bother.\n\nUnlike many news articles I read, your post highlights power dynamics. People accustomed to power don't like the tables turned. Civil discourse and respect are pretty nice when you get to pound a gavel and everyone shuts up. Judge Duncan had the chance to show the merit of his arguments while standing on even ground; he crumbled along with his arguments instead.",

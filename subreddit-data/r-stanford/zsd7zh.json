The belief that moral compasses and empathy are for people who go to state schools. A sad mixture of  precocious entitlement, mixed with a worship of hardcore hyper-capitalism. Steve Jobs as messiah, and always style and pitch over substance of any kind.\n\nDon't get me started on the fake mental illness adopted as a character trait by almost everybody involved in the masturbatory freakshow of Silicon Valley. All tweaked out on California Rocket Fuel, trying to \"change the world\" through \"innovation\".\n\nEveryone involved knows that Carnegie Mellon does real computer science, and Stanford is just Wall Street 2.0, and the startup people are basically hedge funders, contributing nothing to society other than freakish diet and sleeping rituals. \"Look at me, I don't care about money because I wear t-shirts, and I'm going to give all my money away when I die and don't need it anymore.\"\n\nIt's not 1998 anymore. Palo Alto is gross now, and everybody involved knows it. It's not that dishonest people are everywhere, it's that they gravitate to Stanford like it's a magnet, irresistibly drawn to the opportunities like a moth to a flame.\n\nWant to network with criminals?

Not excusing blatant image manipulation and dishonesty in papers nor am I absolving Marc of any responsibility, but sometimes data manipulation in papers can slip under the PI's radar especially if they are managing a huge lab and are juggling multiple responsibilities. It is the PI's/last author's responsibility to inspect the data carefully before publication and know what's going on in their lab, but sometimes lapses in judgment do happen if you are competing to publish something before getting scooped.",

In History, I learned from Pulitzer Prize winners.\n\nI learned about US-Iranian relations from a prof who had fascinating stories about his time in Iran under the Shah and the Ayatollah before coming to America.\n\nA Pulitzer Prize-winning history prof who's one of the country's leading constitutional scholars I had was so attentive to his students that one day when I arrived for class, he asked me about a comment I had made in a Stanford Daily story several days earlier about the ASSU (Stanford's student government).\n\nOh yeah, the history double major was by accident. I took so many history electives for fun that I had nearly finished all the requirements for it, so I declared it midway through senior year and finished two classes Spring Quarter of senior year to fulfill the remaining requirements and graduate on-time in 4 years.\n\nI took only 3 STEM classes in my entire time at Stanford.",

There\u2019s a group (of I wanna say primarily undergrads) called Rethinking Economics at Stanford that contends that the program doesn\u2019t do enough to center \u201c21st century issues\u201d of inequality, climate change, etc. (or at least does so from a fairly limited ideological perspective) \u2014 which depending on your learning goals could be a knock against Stanford, but also IMO also indicates there\u2019s a good population of students thinking more expansively about what econ should accomplish :) humanities majors are definitely more peripheral here than they are at other schools, and the tech culture is very all-consuming, even more so than I anticipated coming in. However, that being said, I\u2019ve taken amazing humanities classes and been able to interact really meaningfully with professors due to small class sizes, and my classmates in those classes have been brilliant. \n\nTLDR Stanford definitely has enough academic strengths and student communities with diverse interests for you to create the experience you want for yourself, even if it\u2019s not the dominant one!",

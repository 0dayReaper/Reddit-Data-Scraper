    "postText": "Hey! I'm an incoming postdoc joining Stanford this fall. I've never lived in the US before, and have heard from a few people that the ratio of costs of rent / utilities / groceries is very different to Europe, so I'm not sure how much of my salary I should be budgeting for rent vs other things (I don't want to get locked into a 12 month rental contract and find that either I'm struggling to afford it, or that I'm staying somewhere that's not great when I could afford somewhere nicer...)\n\nSo I'd be interested in anyone's experience of 1. how much they pay in rent (and whether that includes utilities or not) 2. what their salary / total monthly spend is and 3. whether they feel comfortable / whether they are struggling to afford the rent.\n\nFor reference, my salary will be 80K. The options I've been looking at so far are rooms in shared houses (I've seen these starting from $1800 a month) or studios (the cheapest option I've seen for this is just over $2k a month). My husband will be moving out with me but initially won't be working while he's waiting for his EAD to come through.",

            "comment": "I don't have the exact breakdown, but most phd students get paid around \\~$50k/year (including summers), and pay around $1800 in rent for a studio on campus (utilities included). Health insurance is included. The university meal plan is around $10-12/meal. There's also some free benefits for transportation (caltrain), although stanford is being a bit stingy with that now. Parking is around $35/month. After all of that, grad students tend to have a bit left for spending money. For those with families, there are also assistance programs for food.\n\nI think postdocs don't have access to stanford dorms unfortunately, so you're housing costs are going to be a bit more expensive. A lot of people who live off-campus tend to go to menlo park or redwood city since it's cheaper.",

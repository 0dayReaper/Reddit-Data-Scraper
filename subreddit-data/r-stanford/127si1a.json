    "postText": "I really wanted to take CS 144 (computer networking) this quarter, but haven't taken Cs110/111 yet. Is it doable?\n\nI have experience with bare metal C programming and Arm assembly. I believe my understanding of file structures is my weakest point in this realm.\n\nI could just take 111 on spring and wait for 144 next year if it made more sense.",

    "postText": "I have the ability to take Chem 31M my first quarter, but as a premed student, when I look at requirements for many medical schools it says \"three quarters of general chemistry\" or \"one year of general chemistry.\"  Do medical schools understand that 31M is the equivalent of the first year of general chemistry? Or should I bite the bullet and take 31A/B?",

Has anyone received anything similar? I'd usually ignore something like this but it comes from an official email address.",

I've been told that if you do actually click on the link from a Stanford-originated spam, you'll just get a nastygram. The problem is that if it actually is a malicious person sending it to you, clicking on the link could be disastrous. (i.e. do *not* do it just to see what happens!). It is surprising easy to spoof an email address.\n\nNo idea how often these emails go out to members of the broader campus, but at the medical center (where malicious software is a relatively big threat), I get 3-4 of these per year.",

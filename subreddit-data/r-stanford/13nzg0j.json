    "postText": "Hi!! Incoming freshmen here! :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo give some context, I'm going through a dilemma, as I don't know what I should do. I have always been a curious person who is passionate about learning a bit of everything. I plan to pursue a double major in Economics + CS (IA track), because these are two of the areas that interest me the most, and because they are so versatile, they would allow me to develop in a multitude of fields, whether in the private or public sector.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm quite interested in politics, finance, technology, and the education industry. On the professional side, I am clear about the impact I would like to make in the future, from entrepreneurship to working in government. On the educational side, my ultimate goal is to pursue a PhD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSLE is quite appealing to me, as it could help me discover new areas of interests such as philosophy and critical thinking that would be helpful for a graduate degree, as well as the close-knit community. With all that, one of the main reasons I'm hesitant about SLE is just the amount of time the program consumes, and the eventual possibility that I might have to give up one of my majors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo back to the beginning, I don't know what I should do. Both SLE and the double major track are very appealing to me, but I understand that it will be nearly impossible to have a balanced academic life trying to cover so much. What do you recommend? Should I drop SLE and look for those benefits in another way? What other options do I have to develop \"the same skills\" that I could find in SLE?",

Unless you mean jumping from entrepreneurship to a government role.",

In any case, IF I decide to coterm later, I'll probably choose an area related to politics.\n\nAnd yes, the idea is to become an entrepreneur first and then work in the government, when I'm around my 30s.",

            "comment": "Did SLE and double-majored. I personally really enjoyed SLE and, as an Econ major, I feel like the writing skills I developed through SLE have definitely given me a leg up when writing research papers on economic topics. The support you get with SLE is unmatched. You have small sections, and you work with your section leader to improve your writing, and you get a dedicated writing tutor (they\u2019re called CCs now, but same thing) who helps you formulate your ideas and provides concrete feedback on your writing after each draft. I personally consider SLE worthwhile for this aspect alone.\n\nThe other nice thing about SLE is that it knocks out a significant chunk of your WAYS requirements, so you have much more space in your schedule for the next three years. It\u2019s 8 units a quarter, so realistically you\u2019d be replacing that with 1 additional class each quarter in either Econ or CS. If you don\u2019t do SLE, you\u2019ll be making up those units with your COLLEGE and PWR classes, plus needing additional classes to hit the same WAYS requirements. It seems like a lot of units up front, but you\u2019ll be having to hit those requirements with a similar time commitment later on anyways.\n\nIt sounds to me like the reasons you want to do SLE make you the perfect candidate for the program, so I\u2019d strongly recommend you stick with it. The philosophy will help you with Econ and CS, as it\u2019ll help you to really think through the implications of your projects/proposed policies and give you frameworks to answer some of the bigger \u201cwhy\u201d questions in these fields. The community is strong even after the year is over, and alums tend to be fairly involved. Overall, it\u2019s a great time, and it\u2019s only 24 units out of the 180 unit minimum you need to graduate.\n\nI\u2019m also happy to answer any more specific questions you have about pairing Econ and SLE and the Economics major in general.",

                    "comment": "May I ask what was your second major?\n\nAs you mentioned, those are mainly the benefits that I'm looking for in the program. I would like to conduct at least three research projects (focused on economics and government), and as far as possible, pursue the Honor in Economics. And currently, I feel like I need to improve my writing a lot.\n\nFrom what I read, many departments consider some SLE credits for the major, did you have any difficulty getting your credits double counted for economics?\n\nAnother question I have is about the modality of the classes. I know it's mostly weekly readings, but I wanted to know if there are \u201celectives\u201d within the program, or if everyone ends up taking the same classes. Will I have some \u201cfreedom\u201d to choose my classes/lectures?",

The economics department will definitely set you up for doing government-related research (that\u2019s literally what I\u2019m doing post-grad), and being able to write well and articulate yourself clearly is an incredibly important skill.\n\nThe economics department does not let you double count SLE units, but my other department let me count a quarter\u2019s worth towards my minimum unit count.\n\nIn terms of the day-to-day with SLE, you\u2019ll have classes on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday afternoon and assigned readings each week. Tuesday and Wednesday are lectures in the SLE lounge (in Florence Moore), which are usually 2-3 hours long including breaks. The lectures will be related to your weekly readings. On Wednesday and Thursday, you\u2019ll have sections, which are groups of 12-15 students led by your section leader. You\u2019ll be assigned a new section with different students and a different leader each quarter. On Thursday evening, you\u2019ll often watch a film as well.\n\nThe creativity comes in with your papers. You\u2019ll generally be writing them around a specific text, but the prompt is very open-ended, so there are lots of directions that you can go with it. In terms of flexibility, you\u2019ve got about as much as you\u2019d get with other classes. By participating in SLE each quarter, you\u2019re opting to do the readings, lectures, etc. for this class over another COLLEGE or PWR course. I would think of it as one class among an assortment, all of which will have similar requirements in terms of the type of work expected. If another class that fulfills your COLLEGE or PWR jives with you more in terms of the content it explores, there\u2019s nothing stopping you from dropping SLE and pursuing that instead.",

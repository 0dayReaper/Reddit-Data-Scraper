But many people (myself included) regret missing out on things like a late night stargazing hike with friends because they had too much work.\n\nLastly, there's not much to spend money on campus/nearby. Palo Alto is overpriced and unexciting, and for most things further than that you can usually get Stanford to pay for it if you know how to ask (concert/sports game tickets as \"dorm bonding event\" for example)\n\nUnless you have a very good reason (like other people you need to send support to) I promise you will not regret waiting to find a job til winter quarter.",

I left campus maybe 2-3x a month, and almost all of those were for hikes or dorm trips.\n\nMaybe we did different things, but I'm just not sure how a social life could be seen as expensive? All the parties are free, dorm trips/events are free, all sports games are free, and any club you join isn't going to make you pay for anything until winter quarter.\n\nGoing out to eat would cost money, but Palo Alto felt too expensive to be worth it, and McDonald's isn't worth it either because it isn't any better than a dining hall. I don't recall going out to eat ever frosh fall tbh. Still got awesome food from football tailgates and random events catering zareens/Oren's.",

Spontaneous SF trips are fairly common too for many freshmen.\n\nEven if this is not *purely* a freshman fall issue, eventually many friend groups might start taking big trips together during winter and spring break, they\u2019ll start going out to bars, they\u2019ll start eating out more when they\u2019re tired of the dining hall. Depends on what OP\u2019s financial situation is but I might want to save up for if/when this happens.\n\nBeyond social life though, there\u2019s just the random living-by-yourself costs that I personally never budgeted for. Like the random shit you have to order off Amazon because you didn\u2019t realize you needed it for your dorm, or the last minute Ubers to go run random errands (getting haircuts, going to dentist/eye/other appointments, etc.)\n\nAll these costs add up, more than I could have anticipated. I wouldn\u2019t want to start from 0 freshman fall (assuming that OP is starting somewhere around there).",

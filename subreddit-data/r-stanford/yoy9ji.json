My boss has advised me to continue my education here and wanted to know if it's possible to juggle a 40-hour job and operating systems at the same time?   \n\n\nI did my undergrad from a top 5 CS school down in the South East if that helps but I was an EE undergrad with introductory CS courses like DSA and OOP under my belt.",

You'd be trying to satisfy requirements on both the university and company sides? I'm a bit confused on what you mean by petitioning through the company if it's a degree through Stanford.\n\nAye nice! Yeah, I think if you were familiar with some of the larger ECE/CS and OMS courses at GT, sometimes the systems courses here can fall into the same pitfalls - due to class size everything becomes a bit systematic and often you end up fighting autograders to squeeze points. \n\nDebugging to squeeze performance on these projects does get painful, but would certainly say it's doable - I'm not from a strictly CS background either fwiw.",

There are a set amount of courses you can take but you can also petition for more courses. I don't think it's an HCI/Masters degree looking at it. More of a certificate where you can take some courses.",

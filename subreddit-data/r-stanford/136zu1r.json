    "postText": "I'm in a bit of an odd situation here.\n\nI've lived in Graduate Housing for some years now but will be moving away for the remainder of the year until March 2024. For that reason I've already cancelled my contract. \n\nAs I'll be back in the area in March, I would like to apply for university housing for the Spring of 2024. However, if I do that, can I renew that housing for the summer and autumn of 2024-2025?\n\nI don't want to move in just so I have to move out a few months later.",

I received all the automated emails for renewing my contract which went until August 31st unless renewed (I think they typically do regardless of when you move in). Bear in mind, this was during Covid, so there were a lot of openings in grad housing/more flexibility",

You can still get involved if you stay in EVGR/Munger but I've heard people say that they feel like they go to less events when it takes an extra 5-10 minutes of effort. Seriously feels good to roll out of bed into whatever event is happening downstairs.",

You can go to Rains events if you really feel the need to socialise, but they tail off in terms of attendance and fun by Fall midterms. My GSB friends never seem to have any issues with socialising and going out lol",

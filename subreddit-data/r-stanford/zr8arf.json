Wondering if I should retake 106B or not - if the content for 106B is important for what I want to do, it's important to retake, but I'd prefer not to have to...",

            "comment": "106b is really just like the core fundamentals of CS I think it\u2019s important to at least know and understand them at a decent level probably above a C- grade. At the same time, you\u2019re not gonna need a lot of those things specifically for like ML or data analytics in pandas etc etc. however, most coding positions will require basic CS skills similar to that in 106b so I feel like even if you don\u2019t retake you should attempt to become comfortable with those things. 109 isn\u2019t really a coding class at all it\u2019s just basic probability and I will just warn you that it\u2019s way easier and not indicative of the work you will do in future ai/stats classes or in research/work settings",

If you\u2019re serious about getting better at it, spend some time doing readings/learning online from other sources/finding another way of learning. \n\n106B content is pretty fundamental to programming in general, so there is a lot of material available for self study. Like others have said - its more a question of \u201ccode vs not coding (math)\u201d",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t give too much advice on whether you should retake since I\u2019m not too familiar with how much 106B is required for AI/Data Science but I will say 106B fundamentals seem to be extremely important for tech internship/full time interviews and a lot of CS classes seem to reference 106B material. I will say that Keith Schwarz teaches it in the Winter and the class will be harder than in the Fall (if you\u2019re planning on retaking it right away), but given that you\u2019ve taken the class before, you should have a significant leg up over your peers anyway.",

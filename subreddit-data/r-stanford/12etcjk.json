            "comment": "Stanford is usually quite pleasant. \n\nDue to the micro-climates that are ever present throughout the Bay Area, usually the further north you go up on the peninsula, the cooler it gets. \n\nSummers are usually mid to high 80's, with the occasional warm spell that will push it into the low to mid 90's, with the very occasional triple digit days but that only occurs a few times during the summer. \n\nFall is very pleasant. We didn't have a whole lot of rain this past fall so it was a constant low to mid 60's. Occasionally you will have a hotter or colder day, but mostly pleasant. \n\nWinters are cold-ish, but depending on where you are coming from it could be quite pleasant. This winter was absolutely bonkers, with rain basically every week it seemed like since December. Mornings can get into the high 30's and usually the temps are in the low 50's. \n\nSo far this Spring has been hit or miss this year, with all the rain and atmospheric rivers we've been getting and all. However mostly it's VERY pleasant, probably the best season at Stanford with all of the flowers and trees blooming. Weather is usually in the 60's and sometimes will creep into the 70's like it will this weekend. \n\nOverall, Stanford has quite nice weather. Fog can come in on occasion, especially during the fall and that can drop the temps down significantly. It usually will burn off by 11 or 12 so it's not terrible. \n\nGo further north, it's colder. Go south towards San Jose, significantly warmer. Stanford is right in the sweet spot.",

            "comment": "it's a little strange if you come from a place with consistent weather;\n\nthe mornings can be cold and it gradually heats up in the day. bonus if you're biking and get hot even if it's like 40 degrees. \n\ncoming from east coast, i thought it was going to be way warmer but realized i need to bring my puffer home after thanksgiving. but overall, you may need just a light jacket / sweater to navigate your fall/spring days. it can also rain which happened a lot during winter qtr; but most days its usually clear skies  and  sun. \n\noverall, a-",

            "comment": "Very mild. If you're from any hot state/area (think Arizona, Hawaii, Florida), you'll be cold here. If a cold state (NY, IL, MN), you'll be hot here. This last very-wet year was an anomaly after 5 years of drought.  \n\n\nIt never snows. If we get hail, it makes the news. Agree that we get fog, even in the summer, and then it burns off around lunch, so that means often you'll need a jacket in the morning/evening but not in the day.\n\nHere's the closest weather station. There's also one at the PAO airport, but being right at the bay, it often is cooler/foggier than inland at the campus.   \nhttps://www.wunderground.com/dashboard/pws/KCAREDWO294",

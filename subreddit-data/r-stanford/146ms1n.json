    "postText": "hello folks, I'm an undergrad CMU student who's in Palo Alto for a summer internship. Recently, I've been hoping to pass some time by joining some games of rec soccer, but I've been having trouble with finding information on any active groups that organize games. If any of y'all know of any groups that organize rec soccer games (and are willing to let a non-Stanford student tag in), could you point me in their direction? Thanks much! :)",

Your best bet is to show up to the grass fields and ask nicely to join/be added to the group chat. Usually groups are welcoming to randoms, don't feel intimidated to ask. \n\nOff the top of my head, groups play at Wilbur Field, Roble Field, IM South, and Sand Hill Fields.",

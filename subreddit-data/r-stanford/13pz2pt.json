    "postText": "How much of a time commitment is it? Is it valuable in helping you prepare for Stanford-style writing? I'm just concerned my writing style coming from a relatively non-competitive public high school may translate poorly and hurt my grades later down the line if I don't adjust it now. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "I didn't do SOAR but I will say it feels like every class I take at Stanford has a very different expectation for what \"good writing\" is and there is not a specific style that you will need for stanford undergrad courses (it's different for grad students). \n\nthe PWR writing assignments can be brutal if you didn't have good writing experience in high school. When I took PWR 1 i had never written a paper longer than 2 pages meanwhile most of my classmates wrote at least one 30+ page thesis in high school. Many of the pwr profs grade on improvement but doing a long assignment like this was really intimidating and challenging for me and I think some sort of on-ramp to more intense writing like SOAR would've helped. \n\nWhen you take PWR, I recommend meeting with your prof early and often and asking lots of questions for improvement. I've found that showing the prof that I'm actively putting in effort to improve can make up for not being the best writer in terms of grading. Also, some of the PWR profs are wayyyy nicer than others so choose carefully.",

I came from an under-resourced high school where my teachers didn\u2019t give me much feedback on my writing because other students needed more help and attention. \n\nmy first essay grade when I got to stanford was a slap to the face. luckily I did SLE and got some truly invaluable advice from my assigned writing tutors, but knowing what I do now, I would have taken part in SOAR or something like it before that first quarter.",

    "postText": "I have been offered financial aid of $7000 for attending the summer session as an international graduate student. My total tuition costs are now around $5000 and housing will be another $3000. Is it worth spending $8000 in Stanford Summer Session for attending courses in Machine Learning, Accounting and Swimming? I have already been offered an AI/ML Analyst role with Deloitte. Will attending the said program boost my CV in any way to be ahead of others who aren't offered the same program?  Kindly advise me on the matter.",

If so, then no, it\u2019s never \u201cworth it\u201d to take extremely expensive courses for nothing more than credit (I.e., no degree.)\n\n\nAfter you start at Deloitte you can take courses part-time for free through their tuition assistance program.",

Anyone can pay their way to a fancy summer school program.   \n\n\nMost students also leave during summer, so the experience of attending during the summer will mostly be with other non-Stanford students. If the courses are something you believe will be worth it, sure, but for the campus experience and living in the area, it's not worth it, I would say. It's extremely expensive and very inaccessible without a car. Based on your alternatives, Deloitte sounds more reasonable.    \n\n\nI was an international visiting student researcher last fall, feel free to pm me if you have any questions",

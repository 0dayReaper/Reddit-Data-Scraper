    "postText": "Help Me Choose: Harvard vs. Yale vs. Stanford\n\nI was accepted to these schools with very generous financial aid (full rides or nearly full rides for each school.) I love so many aspects of all three of these schools so it\u2019s going to be very hard to choose!\n\nIntended major: neuroscience (symsys at Stanford) but I might consider cognitive science, psychology or computer science. Im interested in working in a hospital as some type of clinician, but I\u2019m also interested in biotech and might want to see what consulting has to offer me. I might go pre-med.\n\nImportant things I want:\n\n*Support for FGLI students, a non-elitist culture\n\n*Strong Black community\n\n*Support for students with learning disabilities/ neurodivergent students\n\n*Good social scene (I want to party weekly)\n\n **HARVARD**\n\n*Pros of Harvard:*\n\n*Black community seems strong\n\n*Really cool classes in every major I\u2019m considering\n\n*Many research opportunities\n\n*Close to biotech/neuroscience opportunities\n\n*Close to home\n\n*Cons of Harvard*\n\n*The social scene isn\u2019t as good as yale \n\n*Competitive culture?, rumored to be grad-school focused?\n\n*The food is apparently awful\n\n **STANFORD**\n\n*Pros of Stanford*\n\n*Black affinity housing that I\u2019d love to try\n\n*Plenty of majors I can try. The classes sound so enriching!\n\n*Their SymSys/CS/psychology/HumanBio opportunities are really appealing\n\n*CS coterm sounds cool!\n\n*Higher FGLI population\n\n*Quarter system makes studying abroad easy\n\n*Cons of Stanford*\n\n*Quarter system \u2014&gt; hard to line up breaks with my friends/ less rest between academic periods\n\n*Black community isn\u2019t as large as Harvard\u2019s, doesn\u2019t seem as closeknit as Yale\u2019s (correct me if I\u2019m wrong)\n\n*Culture seems influenced by Silicon Valley/tech bros\n\n*Far from home\n\n*Worried about student culture: is stanford v preprofessional? Does everyone worry about getting a career and forget to have fun?\n\n*Social scene isn\u2019t as robust as yale\n\n **YALE**\n\n*Pros of Yale*\n\n*Close to home\n\n*Love the residential college system\n\n*Its culture (artsy, liberal arts) aligns with my vibe\n\n*Campus is beautiful\n\n*Love the black community!\n\n*Strong support for FGLI students\n\n*Love the social scene\n\n*Cons of yale*\n\n*Neuroscience/CS/Biology program isn\u2019t as strong as Harvard and Stanford\n\n*Unlike Harvard/Stanford it\u2019s not near a career hub that I\u2019m interested in",

            "comment": "&gt; Neuroscience/CS/Biology program isn\u2019t as strong as Harvard and Stanford\n\nAt the elite level we're talking about here (three of the top universities in the entire world), this is really not something I would worry about. If you think that you're going to leave Yale with any of those degrees and potential employers / grad schools are going to say, \"Oh, they went to *Yale* -- forget it,\" you're crazy. Going to any one of those three schools will open doors for you that you can't even imagine right now.\n\nThe proximity to a career hub is possibly something to consider, but Yale is not exactly backwoods -- both Boston and NYC are close. And, if you want to get to the West Coast, you'll get as many internship offers as you want in the Bay Area / Seattle / LA if those are places you want to try out.\n\nIt sounds like you love Yale, and the people you met there. It sounds like you'll love to go to school there.",

A social scene for someone majoring in STEM (especially if they\u2019re premed where GPA matters a lot and ECs will take up all your free time) is more like a club, IMO.",

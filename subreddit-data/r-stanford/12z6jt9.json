I don\u2019t really like competitive environments (my hs was like this) but I would put up with it. Both schools seem really friendly/collaborative from what I can see so not really worried about that.\n\nI wanna get a masters (for now I\u2019m really indecisive) and stanford has a coterm thing? If anyone is doing a coterm plz lemme know what it\u2019s like \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nI hate hot weather bc texas so if it\u2019s hot a lot of the time I would be very sad\n\nI kinda wanna know how dorms are like (culture wise and physically) I\u2019ve visited the mit dorms but have no idea what stanford dorms are like\n\nAm also in the dark about professors/classes. Ik mit first semester is pass/no pass and they allow retakes of courses. Is stanford similar? What do y\u2019all think about professors?\n\nWhat's relationships with surrounding area like? does it actually feel like a bubble",

MIT will be slightly more rigorous and intense, but you can only benefit from that if you have the mental fortitude to work through difficult times where you're not getting enough sleep, it's cold and dark all the time, you're isolated, etc. if you're the kind of person that works much better when you're happy, you'll get more out of a Stanford education.",

When this happened to me at Stanford professors offered all sorts of accommodations to make sure I was taking care of myself; it was ok if I missed a few lectures as long as I watched videos and completed the same major projects that everyone else did. When it happened to my partner at mit she was given 0 time to heal and tanked her otherwise stellar gpa. My partner worked much much harder than I did -- pulling all sorts of all nighters on problem sets etc.- and because they didn\u2019t give her any time to process her dads death my gpa ended up being way higher",

Math is obviously good but not full of imo people like mit. Culturally we\u2019re a very applications/startup oriented school which could be good or bad. Also the better place to dabble in the humanities/social sciences.\n\nAs for reasons to pick mit over Stanford\u2026 it\u2019s in a much more urban area than Stanford if you like that kind of thing. (The T in Boston is not bad by American standards.) a lot of people prefer the more rigorous culture. And sure MIT is the nerd school but it\u2019s possible their admin hasn\u2019t neutered the social scene as badly. Don\u2019t trust me on that one though\u2014I don\u2019t know shit about mit\u2014ask people who are there. The dissatisfaction here with admin is very palpable though.",

Some examples:\n\n-shitty neighborhood policy where admin has tried to force people to create communities in an inorganic way\n\n-removing open door alcohol policy. People have to drink behind closed doors which restricts the size of dorm parties and also makes things more dangerous frankly\n\n-cracking down on Greek life. This is more controversial since many students (including me) dislike frats but it\u2019s undeniable they used to be an important locus of social life on campus\n\n-not fixing the SA problem. This is a big reason even the people against Greek life don\u2019t care for the crackdown: no one believes that Stanford\u2019s regulation of frats has made the sexual harassment issue better. It\u2019s more centered on shutting down parties from happening rather than making parties safe.\n\n-besides restricting alcohol, admin has also provided very few alcohol-free social events lol. Not sure about this year but cardinal nights was terrible last year. In general top-down organizing of social life is a terrible idea though\n\n-removing a lot of food vendors post-covid. Was very disappointed I never got the chance to go to the Thai cafe. There\u2019s some vendors who come in every week but I think they\u2019re overpriced\n\n-cutting student organization funding. Undergraduate senate (which are students) is also culpable though since they were fucking terrible to deal with when asking for funding this year\n\n-restricting marguerite shuttle service time. The shuttle not operating on weekends is asinine because that\u2019s when undergrads are most likely to need it. Fortunately student council seems to be pressuring them to change this\n\nAnyways, these are the main complaints I can think of that are specific to our school (eg I could complain about dining, but I doubt mit is better in that regard). Again, it\u2019s not the bad policy that rubs me wrong the most, but rather the obstinance to listening to students. As a reminder, every student at every school complains about admin, and you have the unenviable task of determining if my complaints are valid or just typical college student whining. The grass is not always greener, and many others have had less negative experiences than me. I will say that even if I don\u2019t really \u201cfit\u201d at Stanford, I don\u2019t regret coming here because of the immense academic and professional opportunities available. Best of luck in choosing!\n\nEdit: you should definitely find a similarly cantankerous mit student to complain about mit because otherwise the comparison is not fair. An informed decision requires knowing the cons (and pros) of both schools.",

Stanford is more buttoned down and everything feels more businesslike.  \n\nBeyond that, I would also ask yourself if you want to stay near family or want to have space.  At 17 I wanted the latter and am very glad I made the choice I did, but it\u2019s a very personal decision.",

Some people like that bubble feeling but MIT will be more like a college town, lots of kids will live off campus, and there's more potential to go out and stuff like that a bit easier. My friends at MIT generally seem pretty happy, I know it has a reputation of being super sweaty but I know kids there with varying levels of technical ability and haven't heard anybody say its impossible or crazy (but I think that will depend on your background a bit too).

Some inaccuracies in the last paragraph but the rest is good: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/88jdwu/comment/dwl60ek](https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/88jdwu/comment/dwl60ek)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;When I was making college decisions, I didn't even apply to Stanford, even though I could easily have gotten in. (This is no exaggeration, trust me.) I am from the SF Bay Area, and I know Stanford well. Obviously I chose MIT.The main reason to choose MIT is that it is academically much stronger than Stanford for math/CS. For CS, no other school comes close, and for math, only Harvard and Princeton are in the same league. In recent years MIT has crushed the Putnam exam to an extent which is unprecedented in the history of the exam -- the only historical performance comparable to MIT's 2017 results is ... MIT's 2014 results.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I think for someone with your academic interests MIT is the clear number one choice. The Silicon Valley connection doesn't really favor Stanford much as these companies also recruit heavily from MIT. Likewise the entrepreneurial scene at MIT matches well with Stanford with things like the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition. Perhaps Stanford has a slight edge here, but this difference is dwarfed by the gap in academics. In addition, Boston/Cambridge is orders of magnitude more intellectually and culturally stimulating than Palo Alto. At MIT you are within walking distance of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Fenway Park and TD Garden, countless museums, seven (!) universities, everything from high culture to wild nightlife.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That said, there are valid reasons to choose Stanford, especially if you are the type of student who thrives best in freewheeling environments rather than in pressure-packed environments. As an example, Stanford lets you withdraw from classes anytime before the end of the eighth week of each quarter (source). Note, not semester, but quarter! (Stanford is on a quarter system.) Do the math. Eight weeks is practically the entire quarter. So you can easily bail out of hard classes anytime. MIT is not like that. Having said that, most students who are interested in MIT are the type who thrive under pressure.",

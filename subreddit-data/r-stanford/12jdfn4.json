    "postText": "Schools like Dartmouth, Princeton, Harvard, Yale, MIT, and Caltech are known for their unique undergrad experience. This is largely due to the unique housing system and distinct personalities between the houses that students essentially \"rush\". Another big part is how much each of these schools cares about maintaining the undergraduate culture. This is probably the most done at Princeton and Dartmouth, where admin puts a lot of effort into the undergrad experience, through events and social activities. There are also things like final clubs at Harvard and eating clubs at Harvard, which are another source of old-timey camaraderie. \n\nHow does Stanford's undergrad experience compare to these? I really think this was an important part of my undergraduate experience (I went to MIT), and I'm trying to help my brother decide where to go, as this is very very important to him as well. On the surface, as an outsider, it seems like it's better to go somewhere like Princeton for undergrad and Stanford for graduate school.",

The problem is the neighborhoods feel artificially contrived and in reality just limit your options on where to live. Most people interact with others in their dorm rather than a neighborhood so I don't really know why they thought the neighborhood was a good organizational unit, but it seems like admin is increasingly disconnected from the student body",

The eating clubs are not great, IMO. Others will disagree with me on that. Stanford, for all its faults (hates fun, etc.), does benefit from not being so close to NY/DC. I see some other comments here about how the Stanford administration seems disconnected from the student body, and I'm inclined to agree. Can't speak to the Princeton administration. \n\nOf course, your brother might want that. Where does he live? I think there is a lot of merit in general to the idea of going to a new part of the country for college. All of my kids left California for college, two of them are back now and the other wants to come back. \n\nI do think Princeton is probably the prettiest campus I have ever seen.

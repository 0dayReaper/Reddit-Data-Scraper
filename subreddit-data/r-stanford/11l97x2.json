    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI am interviewing for a remote position (Grade I) and have seen that there are five regional pay structures: \n\n- Stanford Work Location \n- Central \n- East\n- South\n- West \n\nI currently live in Boston and am curious what this means for potential pay if I stay in Boston. If anyone is able to log in to [this google doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ulfJcCeFgFqGOQk4lHik3MIU8aKGi28p/view?usp=sharing) from the cardinalatwork.stanford.edu site or provide further information for me based on their experience, it would be much appreciated! \n\nThanks in advance!",

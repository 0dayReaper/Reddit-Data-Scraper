    "postText": "Dr. Lin Chen is in danger of assassination by China's secret police in the USA\n\nEducated at Stanford and Harvard, Dr. Chen returned to China in 2002 to become the president of a private college.\n\nAs a high-profile returnee and a graduate of Harvard Kennedy School, known as the cradle for leaders of developing countries, Dr. Chen was likely perceived as a challenger by the Chinese Communist Youth League. Senior members of the league had been successors to top government positions in China for years.\n\nIn June 2002, the China Youth Daily, the propaganda machine of the Communist Youth League, launched a smear campaign against Dr. Chen with a series of allegations. However, the Daily refused to confront Dr. Chen with their allegations and blocked independent media from following up to check on the allegations.\n\nBeing an accomplished scholar in financial engineering, having studied under the guidance of Nobel Laureate Robert C. Merton and leading econometrician James H. Stock, Dr. Chen has lived in disgrace with his family shattered and his career ruined for the last twenty years.\n\nOver the years, Dr. Chen has been trying to make an open rebuttal to the allegations to vindicate his name but without success.\n\nRecently, Dr. Chen and his assistants have increased their efforts, posting his rebuttal to some overseas Chinese public forums. However, wherever they appeared, China's net police and agents have worked to spread disinformation and misinformation, undermining his efforts to make his reply known to the Chinese general public.\n\nThe following is a screenshot of a thread of forum discussion in which a disguised Communist agent says, \"For such a trivial matter (referring to Dr. Chen), a little (armed) force and tricks can be used.\" So he inadvertently revealed an assassination plot against Dr. Chen.",

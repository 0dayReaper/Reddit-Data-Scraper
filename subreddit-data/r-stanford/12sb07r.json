    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am an incoming PhD student, and my partner is considering moving to Stanford with me this next year! We are trying to discover jobs and opportunities for her in the Stanford area.\n\nShe is really interested in sustainable farming and urban planning and is hoping to find an entry-level position in one of these fields. Does anyone know of any opportunities or people she could reach out to? Does Stanford Doerr or the O'Donohue Family Stanford Educational Farm have anything available for individuals who are not students?\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "postText": "I got into ucla for business economics as a california resident. It\u2019s been my dream school since childhood, and I was so incredibly excited to commit. However I later got into stanford, which I had absolutely no expectations to do. The imposter syndrome started from the moment I opened that decision as I felt my stats did not even touch those of other admits and they picked me just for diversity/someone who as upper middle class didn\u2019t qualify for a single penny of financial aid for that $80k tuition. I felt like I wouldn\u2019t be happy there as I would constantly be comparing myself to my peers and feel only inadequacy. All that alongside high costs (compared to ucla\u2019s 40k in state), location (closer to home) wanting to double major, and honest attachment and love for the school, I ended up choosing UCLA. Nothing against this incredibly amazing school, it just didn\u2019t feel like it fit for me. How much will this decision impact me in the future/ did i make a good choice?\n\nNote: I want to attend grad school still, so I told myself prioritizing a cheaper cost for undergrad would be worth it in exchange for expensive grad school w/ more prestige",

Don\u2019t doubt she could\u2019ve gotten a top BB/EB IB job and UMM/MF PE job if she chose Stanford, which would\u2019ve paid for the difference (and scales even more as you move up).\n\nSince you\u2019re biz econ, I assume you\u2019re interested in finance/consulting, so hopefully you don\u2019t regret your choice or at least give it some more thought.

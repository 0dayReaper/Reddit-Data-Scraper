So some of us who predate covid were brought in under false pretenses that we would get a normal experience. Honestly what gets me is why Stanford wasn\u2019t the first university to open up on a large scale. It is more spread out, fewer people on campus, it\u2019s rich (can afford a lot of covid related expenses), and has a world class hospital on campus. Many colleges have none of the above.",

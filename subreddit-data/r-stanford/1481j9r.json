    "postText": "I haven't been on campus since 2016, but seeing today's atheletes and the general cultural vibe of the surrounding area I get the impression that today's students are ruder than 7 years ago. \n\nI was wondering what current students think/feel.  Does anyone get the impression that campus culture is now somewhat rude, as in 'ill-mannered, discourtous or insulting?'  \n\nIs gen z just more hierarchical, narcissitic and psychopathic in general (than millenials were), maybe?  Or has nothing changed (it's in my head maybe)?",

The whole gen x + gen z lifestyle and values, parenting style etc seems a lot different.\n\nI feel like boomers emphasized more common decency cultural values growing up, bascally making a big deal about respecting strangers, treating people with kindness on purpose, helping out neighbors and being intrinsically friendly etc.\n\nI get the impression that gen z was taught to ignore strangers, be unfriendly/hostile in general and to be intrinsically competetive/selfish.",

There are amazingly warm, courteous kids on campus BUT there is definitely a sub-culture of robotic coldness that is tolerated to a higher degree than on other campuses I think.   \n\n\nInteresting about the difference between Gen Z and Millenials. Z has X-ers for parents and as such are less trusting of the world in general than are Millenials. We (X-ers) seem to have imprinted that into our kids unwittingly.",

The only thing that I can think of is that Stanford admitted way more students than it was supposed to during the pandemic, so now dining halls and other spaces on campus are really crowded.

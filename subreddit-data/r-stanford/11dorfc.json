    "postText": "If you've checked out *The transits of Venus; a study of eighteenth-century science* by Harry Woolf or books on Neptune's discovery, I'd love to talk. It seems like our research interests align. \n\nI'm finding that many of the old books I'm going through have never been used or opened by others, so there aren't many of us with this interest. Recently, in special collections, I got excited because a text, *Memoir du Passage de Venus* by Chappe (1761), had a page that hadn't been cut open yet. \n\nAnyway, it's a longshot, but maybe people here know others studying the history of science with a focus on astronomy who might like a chat over coffee.",

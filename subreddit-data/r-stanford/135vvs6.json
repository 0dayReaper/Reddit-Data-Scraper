    "postText": "Hi everybody! \n\nI'll be starting a PhD at Stanford in the fall, and I was hoping to hear some opinions on how much I should be aiming to pay for rent. Currently, I've been looking at the premium 2b/2b options in EVGR and Kennedy, which would run me around $1900 per month. I don't plan on getting a car, and after accounting for taxes and budgeting roughly $500 a month for groceries/food, I'd be left with around $1300 a month for all other expenses. \n\nDoes this seem liveable, or would I be better off considering the junior 2b/2b options instead? I'd also appreciate hearing any opinions on whether or not the premium apartments offer significant benefits over the junior apartments. The extra living space seems nice, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. I've seen this [link](https://gradadmissions.stanford.edu/admitted-students/funding-graduate-study/estimated-expense-budget) from the university on a typical single graduate student budget, but I'd appreciate hearing opinions from current students. Thank you!!",

If you need time to decompress alone, any of the private options should be fine. Otherwise, most grad students will spend most of their time in lab or out and about or in common areas anyway, in which case saving the money might make more sense (it does add up!). If you want the social aspect of a roommate and don\u2019t need the privacy, the common areas are usually plenty of room and that\u2019s a great option all around",

Something to take into consideration. I think personally that evgr premium is too much, so I live in a rains apt instead. I\u2019d rather save that $400 difference, which is closer to 10% of your overall stipend.",

The kitchen is pretty cramped and the fridge they provide is way too tiny for 2 people. The lack of any living room at all sort of wears on you over time. I'd say the EVGR 2b/2b junior is a little better and more worth it if that's the price range you want.\n\nI've visited friends who live in the premium options and think about switching each time, but it is hard to say if it's worth the cost. I'll say that when they visit my housing, they think theirs was worth it though lol.",

Unlike others here, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that far off though, if you planned 3 meals a day included in that.\n\nI took a look at my household grocery spending over the past 2 years and we come at an average of 750 a month for 2 people. I don\u2019t eat breakfast and  have been eating outside for lunch during this period, so 5 days a week that did not include my lunch (but it included bfast and lunch for my partner). We also eat fish but not other kinds of meat, and while I enjoy the Sunday farmers market on Cal Ave (go every week), the bulk of my groceries come from TJ or Real Produce. I\u2019m sure the seafood is pushing the budget up. We also don\u2019t buy snacks, sweets or stuff like juice though. \n\nI think 500 is definitely enough for one person to eat very well and am sure you can drive that way down w a bit of planning.",

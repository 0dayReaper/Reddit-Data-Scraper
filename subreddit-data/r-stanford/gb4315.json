Rutger Bregman always says that the best mind of his generation aren\u2019t around a table trying to end hunger or solve the climate crisis - they\u2019re trying to get more users to click ads. Cory Doctorow said he once interviewed a brilliant engineering team that works on an algorithm, which predicts which stocks would go up and buy them. They had to disguise the way their code worked, because there are competing companies wasting time on similar speculative investments. \n\nAnd this is \u201cwork\u201d. Good paying jobs. Nurses and teachers barely make ends meet, but those engineers get paid well. It produces nothing, other than consumerism and the ensuing CO2 emissions.",

They return to the site, the browse multiple pages at a time, they actually scroll through the content (aka generate ad impressions and clicks). Unlike your average user who will visit your site once, browse a single page, and never come back again.\n\nSo what did they do? They said \"well, if we get more people to subscribe to the newsletter, then we'll have better users! And if we implement browser notifications on top of that, we can get even more valuable users!\"\n\nAnd here we are.\n\nWe all suffer with awful UX all over the web because some PO's wanted to demonstrate how good they are at improving the product by increasing ad impressions by a ridiculously tiny percent.",

I believe the reasoning behind apps everywhere was similar to what you described  - app users are more valuable. What's correlation and what's causation? It doesn't matter, this is business!

If you've looked at the people who have been lifted out of desperate poverty in the last few decades the progress has been stunning. \n\nI also used to think we'd be better off as still being hunter gatherers, but there you have to deal with pestilence and no adequate medical care, and getting your brains bashed in and every female in your family getting raped by a rival tribe. Heck, maybe they were happier due to closer communities, but even if that's true there's really no way to stuff technology back into the box.\n\nMy problem in adjusting to the work world was realizing how... small I am. I like so many young people wanted to change the world without realizing I am an extraordinary small part of it. As a result, I am given very small and unimportant problems to solve.\n\nWork may seem pointless but the reason we have so much abundance now, and aren't working from sun up to sun down picking muddy fields, is that every year people work to find more efficient ways to do things. That's what a lot of educated white collar workers do.\n\nThat's not disappointing. In fact it's better now that my ego is more in check. Change is possible but it's much harder than it looks, and just changing yourself and a few people around you is a big achievement.\n\nAnyway, I might have misunderstood your point but just wanted an opportunity to ramble.

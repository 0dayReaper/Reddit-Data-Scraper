The owner did his best to minimize the impact on the business over time by keeping the rent reasonable. However, that property is now worth a ton of money, and the owner thought it was time to sell. No matter how much the Nuthouse made, it was never going to be enough to pay the rent at the market rate or buy the property.\n\nThe group that bought it was all ready to redevelop the property, but nothing has happened. They came up with a design, but it looked stupid. Also, it would keep the building block structure, so that's odd. It currently has \"for lease\" signs up. It sounds like they scaled back. It's just sitting empty and sad.",

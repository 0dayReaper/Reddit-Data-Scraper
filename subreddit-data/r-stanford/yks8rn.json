I have accounts with them and another with a national bank, and I heavily prefer SFCU. The terms of the checking account and non-network withdrawals (especially when traveling abroad, at least for the student accounts) are vastly superior to my national bank. they also offer some solid credit cards if you\u2019re in the market for one.",

You don't need a checking account to open a credit card with a particular bank, and going with SFCU over any of the aforementioned cards means you're potentially leaving thousands of dollars worth of points on the table.",

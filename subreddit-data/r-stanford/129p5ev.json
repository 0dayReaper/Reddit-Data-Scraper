            "comment": "First off, congrats on getting into Stanford! If you keep up a smart work ethic, you'll be good regardless of your choice.\n\n     \nWhat do you want out of a college experience? You might want Harvard or Yale for the relative proximity to DC and the high concentration of people hoping to get into politics, but you might want Stanford instead for exposure to the cutting-edge of ideas and technology (if you want to justly govern, you will need to make informed decisions about things like ethical AI, patent/copyright evolution, climate externalities, etc.). Stanford probably has a lower proportion of politics-focused people than Yale might, but that could also mean more concentrated resources for you (\"small fish big pond\" and vice versa). And of course, you can always go to another out of the 3 for law school.\n\n\n       \n\nAll of that's just about 1 career path. College is also a time to explore, learn beyond your niche, and meet interesting people along the way. Do you want a mild Bay Area climate where you can play sand volleyball outside in February, or do you prefer bright fall foliage in exchange for cold and snowy winters? What if you fall out of love with pursuing a political office, and want to study and do other things instead? \n\n\n      \nFinal piece of advice, go to each school's Admit Weekend if you can. Talk to people, feel the campus vibes, get some ice cream. You have a whole month to make your choice.",

            "comment": "All I could really tell you, based on the information you've provided, is that Harvard or Yale would both be better options for you. They have stronger track records of being breeding grounds for future politicians and will both have stronger networks to get you in the door.\n\nBut I'd actually say that you haven't really provided enough information for anyone to give you truly worthwhile feedback. All three universities can provide an excellent education and help prepare you to get into a T14 law school. But they have very different cultures from one another. Other than wanting to eventually get into politics, what are you interested in? What kind of people are you interested in meeting and hanging out with? What kind of place would you like to live in for the next four years? These are the kinds of things you need to be asking yourself to help make the best decision.",

I\u2019m not sure how I feel about being in New Haven for 7 years straight, that\u2019s sounds pretty unbearable for me as I like exploring new places. So maybe narrowing it down to Harvard and Stanford would be better (also, I just generally don\u2019t really like New Haven and prefer either to California vibes or urban/colonial mix vibes of Boston",

            "comment": "PoliSci-History alum here. There's a reason why HYS is an acronym. That being said, I would suggest trying to go to law school at a different place than your undergrad though to give you a second alumni network.\n\nAnyway, back to the present. Try to visit each school. Whether you visit or not, get a sense for its culture and what you'd enjoy.\n\nThe ability to succeed in law and politics from HYS is virtually indistinguishable. Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Georgetown all rotate every couple of years in the top 4 for having the most alumni in the US Senate, for example.  In the US House, those four are the top for private schools, though a lot of state schools perform better in the House than the Senate.  From 1994-2005, eight of the nine Supreme Court justices were alumni of Harvard, Yale, and/or Stanford. All have produced U.S. presidents, foreign presidents and prime ministers, etc. Among non-famous alumni, these are three of the preeminent schools in the country, especially in the fields of law and politics.\n\nThe ability to be successful in law or politics or to get a good PoliSci education isn't going to be how you can decide between Stanford, Harvard, and Yale. You have to decide on culture, environment, weather, dorms, sports, how far from home you want to be, etc.",

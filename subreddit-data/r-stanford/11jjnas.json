    "postText": "im a CS major with very little CS experience outside of classes, and im trying to prepare for the next year's recruiting cycle. i likely do not have a summer opportunity lined up so im trying to take more cs classes to make up for that..\n\nrelevant classes ive taken this year so far:\n\nFall: CS107\n\nWinter: MATH51, CS103\n\nand im planning to take CS109, CS161, and PWR in the Spring. Is this enough for getting involved with research / the next recruiting cycle? what other cs classes could i take without demolishing my mental health?\n\nany thoughts would be greatly appreciated !",

You have enough for some CS profs but I've always heard a lot of CS profs want you to have a good amount of experience, especially if it's AI/ML focused, but it just depends on finding someone willing to take you on. So it's definitely possible but just might be a little harder",

If you want an internship, like others have said, 106B is enough. Get on leetcode and apply, apply, apply. For research, since you\u2019re still a sophomore a great option for summer research is an REU (Google it)",

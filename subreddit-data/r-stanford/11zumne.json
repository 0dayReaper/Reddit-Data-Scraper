This culture of fear and never ending administrative bureaucracy has led to the decline of campus life and was a contributing factor in the death of Katie Meyers. \n\nSummed it up as best as I could. It covers a great deal of close to a decade of the worst events in Stanfords history and how they tie into the overarching student conduct procedures.",

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re interested in what I have to say, but I\u2019m going to say it anyways. It\u2019s not a word count comparison problem, it\u2019s an issue of media literacy. It is objectively true most of the story comes from a frat dude\u2019s perspective, and this is fine: most long form journalism is narratively structured around a main character. But as a journalist, you should be aware of the biases that a frat *president* may have, and at least place more emphasis on differing viewpoints. There are a lot of people critical of greek life on campus, and if your aim is to describe a campus-wide phenomenon, you should try to capture campus-wide viewpoints as well as you can. The thing is, a lot of frat-critical people probably agree with the frat guy from this piece: nobody wants parties banned, we just want a safer environment. The admin\u2019s reaction to this school\u2019s terrible SA problem has been to ban fun, rather than make fun safe. This article does get at that when it mentions the Brock Turner incident. But I think you also have to understand student (and public) discontent with the high rates of SA here\u2014and how Greek life is often connected to that\u2014to understand how Stanford was able to legitimize its policies in the past few years: by presenting them as an antidote (a terrible one unfortunately) to a very real problem. (There is also the covid aspect of course.) This is just with respect to Greek life; again, I think there is more room to focus on how even non-partying students have had their life affected. It\u2019s necessary to talk about how frats have been affected\u2014obviously, they have been one of the biggest targets\u2014but asking people around campus for their different viewpoints better highlights the roots and contours of our shit admin problem.",

If they don\u2019t look like they\u2019re doing everything they can, institutionally, to eliminate under-age drinking and reduce drinking in general, then they are open to criticism and lawsuits next time there is an injury. Similar rationale for the other issues mentioned like cheating and sexual assault. (That having been said, I generally agree with the article. If someone is being investigated for allegedly doing something terrible where being guilty would ruin their lives, then the presumption of guilt and the denial of due process rights are very much not ok).",

Students come here in the most precious moments of their growth \u2013 18 to 22 years old \u2013 an important time to learn about healthy relationships, friendships, sex, your own values and boundaries, etc. I mean honestly, what message are we sending to 19-year-olds to say \"so sorry, teenage boys can't stop raping girls, no more parties.\" What the fuck? \n\nStanford running from that obligation by shutting everything down is just...no. We can do better and should expect better from one of the top universities in the country with billions of dollars in the bank. You can figure it out. Try. I don't see any trying?\n\nI'm an older transfer, I have no personal investment in this, but I definitely feel for the undergrads when I ask them about it. I partied when I was young, but most of these kids really are just going to have a few drinks on the weekends and remain good kids dedicated to their studies. They deserve to want to have a youth, fun, a college experience, and a social life, and not spend these amazing years of their life only working. It's really sad to watch kids feel like their youth is being taken from them because Stanford can't get its shit together. \n\n(P.S. I understand that men get raped and there are more than two genders and do not want to get into that fight. It is also important to acknowledge the very real stats that women experience SA much more than men on college campuses, to an epidemic level. I'm sure the stats for queer and trans people are even more appalling.).",

            "comment": "lots of people like it lots of people hate it. It gets boring and they serve the same chicken with different spices every day but that happens at most dining halls anyway. The biggest downside is we don't have like regular stations that many schools have like a sandwich station, pizza station etc you're just stuck with the salad bar or whatever they serve. Also, beware that what they post on insta is better than what it really is. You can also look at the menus online to get a sense of what they are serving",

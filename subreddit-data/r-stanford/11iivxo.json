They\u2019re much better deals, you\u2019ll actually use your degree, and the work will be interesting\u2026 which can not be said for the typical paths branching off ROTC, which exists, more or less, to train managers (aka officers) for the military.",

([https://undergrad.stanford.edu/reserve-officer-training-corps-rotc](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/reserve-officer-training-corps-rotc))  But you get all the benefits of ROTC, as well as receiving a Stanford degree.  \n\nIf you think the commute isn't worth it, then you could just enroll in one of those other schools instead, and accept their ROTC tuition benefits instead.....",

We usually carpool together which makes it a little more bearable, and historically the Office of Military Affairs Community has funded ZipCars if we don\u2019t already drive ourselves. Other ROTC programs have different schedules; I think NROTC commutes to Berkeley on Thursday afternoons, so the traffic is really bad.\n\nThis is my 4th year in AFROTC though, and while some mornings are really rough with little to no sleep, it\u2019s been absolutely worth it. The camaraderie is great, and if you really want to be an officer in the military then I think it\u2019s a sweet gig (if you\u2019re an upperclassmen, you\u2019re basically guaranteed a scholarship in AFROTC). I also personally like not having ROTC on campus because it allows me to separate my military and academic/social life.",

For example, Santa Clara doesn\u2019t have Navy or Air Force ROTC, and SJSU doesn\u2019t have Navy or Army ROTC.",

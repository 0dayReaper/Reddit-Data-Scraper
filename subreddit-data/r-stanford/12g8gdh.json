    "postText": "I was so fortunate to be accepted to Stanford and Yale for the Class of 2027, and I find it difficult to decide which one to attend. For context, I am from the west coast, and financially, both gave great aid packages, so this is not an issue. I plan to study feminist/gender studies or cognitive science on the pre-med track. I would love to stay on the west coast because of the proximity to home and the great weather, but I have some hesitations/questions I would love to learn more about!\n\n* How is research available for undergraduates?\n* What is the culture of Stanford? Is everyone really competitive with each other, or is everyone friendly? Specific to pre-med, are students cutthroat with each other or more collaborative?\n* Are students truly happy at Stanford or more so stressed out? (I really want to be in a fun atmosphere, more so collaborative, \"happy\" university where everyone helps each other and wants to be friends, so this is a worry of mine)\n* What is it like to be a non-CS or non-STEM major at Stanford? Is it isolating, or is the CS/tech culture a lot?\n* Is there a strong LGBTQ community at Stanford? (This is something I am looking for in a college!)\n* If anyone is pre-med or a Feminst/gender/sexuality studies major at Stanford, I would love to hear about your experience too!\n\nThank you so much - i appreciate u!!",

            "comment": "1.\tYeah, this is very doable\n2.\tbetter than Yale for sure. It\u2019s quite collaborative, people are generally kind, Stanford does grade inflation (although some rough classes in Chem) so things don\u2019t end up really competitive\n3.\tpeople are who they are. Top schools select for people who are going to be stressed out. That being said Stanford has some good infrastructure for happiness, with the (major) exception of a nice surrounding city. It\u2019s hard to get off campus, there\u2019s not a lot to do in Palo Alto, and SF kinda sucks. However, Stanford is beautiful and yes people are happy.\n4.\tthe CS community is huge and has a lot of pull. That being said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s only a bad thing. The added scientific perspective to the humanities and Vice versa are important. But it\u2019s a bit of a drag sometimes.\n5.\tyes, probably stronger than you\u2019ll get at any Ivy\n\nAs a Stanford student, I\u2019ve never really questioned if it was the right decision. I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s anywhere else like Stanford. Unless the lack of a nice surrounding city is a dealbreaker (some people really need it), I would strongly advise Stanford. Although I\u2019m obviously a bit biased lol",

I think you\u2019ll do great at either school and it\u2019s just a personal preference.   \n\n\nCS is so prevalent here it can be suffocating sometimes. I remember coming in adamant about not touching cs, but here I am trying to major in cs and also do premed. I kind of wish that stanford wasn\u2019t so cs focused.   \n\nI never explored Yale that much, but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a lot more collaborative than Stanford. Stanford social scene isn\u2019t bad though. \n\nHaven\u2019t interacted with the lgbtq community here as much, but I haven\u2019t heard about any problems.\n\nRegarding premed stuff, there\u2019s a lot of cool classes and opportunities. Feel free to dm for more info",

I started looking super late (like in February) and still got one after cold-emailing two PIs.\n2. Very collaborative from what I've seen.\n3. Most of the stress I've seen are self-imposed as there are so many resources and it's hard to resist the temptation to take advantage of as many of them as you can.\n4. You are 100% going to meet a lot of tech bros, but there's also plenty of humanities people. Look into SLE if you are interested in humanities.\n5. Plenty of LGBTQ+ people here, and there's Terra house which is LGBTQ themed. Can't speak to the community thou since I'm not really part of it.",

            "comment": "- research is available if you look for it and email your professors or other PI\u2019s you\u2019re interested in researching under, but you\u2019ll find that at Yale too \n- I\u2019ve seen a lot about it being extremely competitive and I would say it\u2019s pretty competitive from what I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s a lot of everyone pretending they\u2019re doing okay/relaxed but I know a lot of people who are struggling and competing against each other on the down low. \n- My sister went to Yale and I\u2019ve visited a lot. I\u2019d say that yale is a lot less stressful environment wise. Stanford is collaborative, but I\u2019d say Yale gives more of that happy and collaborative environment where everyone is always willing to be friends and are \u201ctruly\u201d happy. She also went to Stanford for undergrad and is doing her masters at Yale. She can\u2019t speak for the undergrad experience but as of now, she kind of sees it as that sort of happy environment and maybe better than Stanford. \n- I\u2019m in CS, so can\u2019t necessarily speak on the non-cs environment. \n- There\u2019s definitely an LGBTQ community here\n\nI would say Yale if you\u2019re going premed. I have some friends who attend Yale currently and they really love it. It\u2019s stressful at times because of the coursework but they thrive in the collaborative environment! There\u2019s also a lot of opportunities for premeds in Yale (or so they told me)!",

I wouldn't say being a non CS major is isolating, but being a non STEM major can be. from my time here so far, i've only met like three humanities people \n\n\\- there is! &lt;3",

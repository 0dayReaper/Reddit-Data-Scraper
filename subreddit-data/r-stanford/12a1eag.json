    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI was admitted to both and am trying to decide between the two.\n\nI would probably study CS / SymSys or maybe MSE at Stanford. At Berkeley, I'd be part of their MET program which is a dual degree in business + engineering (has special recruiting/mentorship things like guaranteed freshman internships)\n\nThings I'm considering:\n\n\\- Social life / things to do / community\n\n\\- Career prospects/recruiting/earnings (interested in either startup work/founding a company or product management (have heard its much easier to break into PM via MET) or swe)\n\n\\- Entrepreneurship/startup resources, access to funding/mentorship, finding co-founders, opportunities, etc\n\n\\- Overall experience / vibe\n\nIgnoring cost, any advice/suggestions/experiences? Thank you!",

I can\u2019t really speak to points 2 and 3 because I don\u2019t have experience in those areas, but:\n\nBerkeley\u2019s CS/EECS department is HUGE and you will leave with a massive network of people in similar disciplines as you\n\nStanford does have more prestige in general, but both Berkeley Haas and Berkeley CS are extremely well respected and no one can really argue with any substance that they aren\u2019t world class programs. The quality of education is impacted more by the quality of professors than the prestige, and no one can say the professors at either school are not world class\n\nsocial life and community is MUCH more lively (and chaotic) at berkeley, so it is up to you to decide. the best way i can put it is: berkeley is in a city, stanford is in a suburb, and you can definitely tell that translates to the vibe of the campus\u2019s. if you like having a ton of people around you, things open late, active night life, choose berkeley. if you like more quiet calm and peaceful, choose stanford (stanford is also safer at night)\n\ni prefer stanford\u2019s academic environment over berkeleys. never once have i felt any toxicity or unnecessary competition between peers at stanford, but i did feel that sometimes at berkeley. it\u2019s completely possible this is also related to grad school vs undergrad, but obviously i have no way to confirm that\n\noverall I love them both, but i am extremely glad I attended them in the order I did. Berkeley gave me an amazing experience when I was younger, and now i can benefit from stanfords academics as well. again, the choice is yours and there really isn\u2019t a wrong choice",

Having never attended Berkeley it's hard to say what you should do personally but Stanford of course has the prestige and potential for getting star faculty as your profs. However my freshman year at Stanford I knew a guy from my dorm who was miserable socially and was transferring to Berkeley instead. He said he had visited the campus and knew he would be happier once he left. I graduated from Stanford in the 90s but my son is an undergrad now and it makes me sad to see how the campus has died down socially. We used to have a huge number of on campus parties to choose from if we wanted every weekend, even though not everyone would go of course. Now it's a lot more subdued and I think it's hurt the overall morale and school spirit.",

            "comment": "Hey! I feel like I have a lot to say about this question because I went through the exact same decision last year. I ended up picking Stanford despite it costing twice as much, where I'm currently studying CS with a Math minor, and a potential MS&amp;E coterm (Master's), but I am still in touch with a few people who chose Berkeley MET and are part of Berkeley EECS as a whole. If I could go back and do it all again, I would choose to go to Berkeley MET, but when it comes down to it, I think your decision should be made based on a few different criterion.\n\nFirst, I'll go over what pros I've seen from Stanford so far. I think that Stanford has a generally supportive academic community. While there isn't much competition at Stanford, I think that the Duck Syndrome is still quite prevalent, where people seem to be getting good grades and leading active social lives without showing everyone the amount of hard work and struggle that they are going through. I think this is mostly a result of the Silicon Valley fetishization of raw intellect, but from what I know about Berkeley, the competition there makes you feel more of \"I'm not doing enough compared to my peers.\" So, different types of competition, but as a whole Stanford definitely wins here.\n\nI think that another pro of Stanford is the ability to do a coterm, which is essentially a Master's degree that you can apply for past your sophomore year. It gives you an edge in the job market and more of a goal to work towards. Also, the housing situation at Stanford is more stress-free and the campus is safer as a whole, which is definitely a plus.\n\nThe pros of Berkeley MET are derived more from the networking opportunities. Take a look at the LinkedIn profiles of some of the students at the program and you'll see what I'm talking about. Insane opportunities that are exclusively offered to you. If you are a MET student, you are starting off college at a higher status than nearly everyone else. This advantage affords you further opportunities down the line to make you ahead in the job market or really whatever you want to do. The internships that the first-year and second-year students receive tend to be amazing, and given the condition of the tech job market right now, this would be really key. At Stanford, you'd pretty much have to recreate your resume from scratch, which is much harder to do.\n\nAlso, most of the issues associated with Berkeley as a whole aren't really applicable to MET students. They receive priority housing and class registration, and they have a leg up in the whole internship process. In fact, I've heard that they go on really amazing retreats and trips that are fully paid for by the staff.\n\nBerkeley's CS program is on par with Stanford's so I wouldn't worry too much about ranking. In terms of feel of general campus, Stanford is much nicer than Berkeley, but Berkeley has more stuff to do. It's really hard to leave the Stanford campus, while Berkeley has shops and restaurants that line every corner.\n\nThose are only some of the differences; let me know if you have any more questions or want more clarification on your decision!",

    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI'm an incoming PhD student at Stanford and I've been experiencing some symptoms that I believe may be related to ADHD. I was wondering if anyone could offer some guidance on the ADHD testing process with Cardinal Care. \n\nI've read that the Schwab Learning Center offers ADHD screening services, but I'm not sure what the process looks like or what my options are. If anyone has any experience with ADHD testing at Stanford or has any resources they can share, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nThank you in advance for any information you can provide!",

Also if you will be using the diagnosis for academic accommodations, you usually need to start the process of getting approval before the quarter starts if you want your letter to be ready in time. So I would recommend starting early",

    "postText": "I need to choose between Stanford and Columbia for my postgraduate studies. I bonded with some of my closest friends over acid and I'm curious, how open are Stanford students towards psychedelics? Does my image of smart, creative Stanford students who take initiative and who are not afraid to leave the beaten path hold true (with regard to psychedelics or other issues)?  \nShort disclaimer: Obviously, focusing on academics and staying away from drugs is more than respectable, just asking out of curiousity and personal interest.",

There are coops (EBF, synergy) where they have entire dorm activities revolving around psychedelics \n\nI would say there is a much harsher \"judgement\" against harder drugs, including cocaine, but psychedelics is just much more common and culturally accepted.",

Compsci has a mix, e.g. graphics enthusiasts versus stats/ML squares. Disclaimer: my impressions were formed decades ago. There have been surveys you can find if you look hard enough.",

            "comment": "Good article explaining the differences.\n\nAs baycommuter said, a lot of admitted students coming from a high school culture of \"10 APs are better than 5 APs\" think two majors are better than one.  This is rarely the case. In fact, there's typically little upside and a few downsides to this decision, namely the opportunity cost of missing out on taking classes that interest you more but don't check the box of the 2nd major, not to mention the additional stress of fitting it all in.  Usually that becomes self-evident in the first year or so.\n\nSometimes it does makes sense to double major or pursue a minor.  That's usually driven by deep curiosity or interest in multiple fields, not for any career benefit (can't think of a situation where an employer will pay you more for a double degree).   Or take a bunch of classes in the 2nd field that you're interested in because (a) they deeply interest you or (b) will help your career or graduate study, but without the concern that you fulfill every last requirement for the 2nd degree.\n\nStanford has such an abundance of interesting classes to take and the 4 years go by quickly. Years later, sometimes the classes that stick with you most have nothing to do with your major.",

Things often unfold in ways you might not expect when you arrive.",

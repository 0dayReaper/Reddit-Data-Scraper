    "postText": "Dear Stanford community,\n\nAs we look ahead to fall quarter, I am writing to share an update on the crucial role that COVID-19 vaccines will play. As a reminder, we are planning to welcome all undergraduate class years to campus, including many who will be in residence for the first time in college. Our student housing involves congregate living. And we are looking forward to resuming the social activities and cultural and sporting events where we gathered before the pandemic.\n\nStanford\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine Governance Committee has been reviewing conditions and developments around vaccination against the virus, including an increase in supplies of vaccine and greater availability of appointments. Public health officials at the county, state and national level encourage all of us to be vaccinated. As CDC Director Rochelle Walensky has stated, \u201cWe continue to encourage every American to get vaccinated as soon as it\u2019s their turn, so we can begin to safely take steps back to our everyday lives. Vaccines can help us return to the things we love about life, so we encourage every American to get vaccinated as soon as they have the opportunity.\u201d\n\nBased on these recommendations from the CDC and from our Vaccine Governance Committee, Stanford plans to require all undergraduate, graduate and professional students coming to campus this fall to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19. All students will be asked about their vaccine status prior to their arrival on campus for the fall quarter. We will work to help arriving students obtain a vaccination if they have been unable to obtain one at their home location.  \n\nWe will accommodate those who cannot take the vaccine for medical or religious reasons. Students in these situations will be able to request an exception and, once it is approved, will be required to undergo regular COVID-19 testing. Other requirements may also apply.\n\nWe know you will have questions about this policy and the details of how it will be implemented, and we will provide more details in the coming weeks.  \n\nStanford is also continuing to evaluate the vaccination situation for faculty and staff, and we expect to provide an update soon. But we want to share this information now with students and prospective students as they make their plans for the fall.\n\nWe believe this approach to student vaccination is necessary to support health and safety this fall. Vaccinations are a critical component in our efforts to mitigate risk and protect one another\u2019s health within our student environment. We expect that other public health safeguards will also continue to be in place in the fall. These will be determined by public health rules and conditions at the time, but as one example, we expect that mask wearing, particularly indoors where others are present, will still be a part of campus life in the fall.\n\nWe encourage students to get a vaccine as soon as they are able. For students who are seeking vaccination now, please view this recent message about making an appointment, and consult healthalerts.stanford.edu/vaccinations for additional information.\n\nThank you for doing your part to help us renew \u2013 safely \u2013 the activity and vibrancy on the Farm that we have missed for the past year. And, as a reminder, the virus is still very much with us today, and highly transmissible variants pose an additional danger. We strongly encourage you to continue following the health protocols, including physical distancing and wearing of face coverings, that have enabled us to proceed with optimism and excitement for the fall quarter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPersis Drell\nProvost",

But based on what we know right now, all other restrictions should be gone.\n\nAnd if they require vaccinations for students, they should also require them for staff and faculty.",

And the Stanford campus doesn't just have members of the Stanford community. There will be unvaccinated people coming and interacting with people here, including children who can't be vaccinated yet. \n\nThe Covid vaccines are very effective but none are 100%. A few years ago there were mumps breakouts on campuses where the majority of the population had been vaccinated, for example. I think the greatest concern is with variants that are savage in other countries right now, some of which are especially contagious in kids and younger people. \n\nI do think the rules on mask wearing need to be relaxed. For one if they're too strict it's going to be harder to keep up compliance. But I get the reason they'll still be important indoors and in certain contexts.",

There's an unfortunate percentage of the adult population who has easy access to the vaccines but refuse to get one, and children cannot yet take them.\n\nWe're still in an acute emergency. This is a global pandemic and we're impacted by what happens elsewhere. Japan just went into its third emergency due to the variants that are especially contagious among young people. They're still much better off than the US but nevertheless.... we have to be vigilant. \n\nTo repeat I do think there needs to be some sensible relaxation with the mask rules, especially in settings that are really closed off to those outside of the community,  like in residences. Not being as strict with the rules can help lessen fatigue with them so there's more compliance when it's really needed.",

I hope they can find a way to help the few students who will begin Stanford as minors and may wish to be vaccinated but be unable to due to their parents refusing to give consent. In some states and countries older minors can consent on their own, and in others they cannot. My cousin went to a school for gifted kids, and it's not uncommon for students to graduate early and begin college well before 18. One of her friends was put into an unfair predicament due to her mom being an anti-vaxxer unable to be persuaded.",

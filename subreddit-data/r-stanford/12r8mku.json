    "postText": "hey guys, I would really appreciate any and all honest opinions on stanford and advice, especially in regards to these questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. how easy is it to land a job in finance/econ post stanford, in comparison to wharton for instance? Do most people in that field end up going to grad school or can they find jobs in the field with just a stanford undergrad? (especially in quant finance or econometrics)\n   1. *I really don't want to go to grad school, and I know that if I chose UPenn's Huntsman program, I would not need to, but I think Stanford's flexibility and stem focus in relation to economics and finance might be a better fit for me.* \n2. How easy is it to coterm especially in MS&amp;E? \n   1. *This is the only type of grad education I'm considering.* \n3. How competitive is the school atmosphere in your opinion, especially in comparison to berkeley or penn? Is the community encouraging and welcoming? Are clubs and opportunities difficult to get into or are they relatively welcoming to anyone?\n   1. *I really want to have experience in clubs, research, internships and just learn properly academically, but I know a cut-throat competitive environment will make that more difficult for me.*\n4. Does Stanford offer lots of hands-on applications in courses or is it more theory based? How is the study abroad and civic engagement at Stanford?\n   1. *I am super interested in civic engagement and generally making my mark in policy.*\n5. Is there more of a grad student focus? \n6. How are the dorms? What are your thoughts on the dorm system at Stanford?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat else do you wish you guys knew as prospective freshmen considering Stanford? Please let me know because I would love to keep that in mind as well!",

            "comment": "I might not be the best person to answer all this because I\u2019m in a different area and graduated last year but I had a little time so here goes. \nTldr: go to Stanford. It\u2019s Stanford. Going to the visit day will help with that. \n\n1. Probably it is not difficult especially if you are in anything quantitative/tech related. Probably undergrad is fine but there are MBAs and coterm to consider. People love hiring Stanford grads in general although the market is really bad right at this moment (hopefully better when you graduate) \n\n2. Pretty easy. It\u2019s been getting more competitive post COVID and that\u2019s a popular coterm but generally WAY easier to coterm than to get in separately. You will have a really good chance as long as you do okay in classes and have relevant experience/extracurriculars\n\n3. It depends on your major but generally way more chill than Berkeley. People are pretty welcoming. It depends on the club but most are pretty welcoming. \n\n4. Super easy to get involved in research. Easy to study abroad. You should be fine but make sure you talk to people in your major for specific suggestions. \n\n5. Not really. Again somewhat department dependent but Stanford really tries to focus on undergrads. That\u2019s where a lot of the $$ comes from \n\n6. The dorms can vary. Most are decently livable, some are actually nice. The housing system is a bit weird and I think the neighborhood system is the subject of some debate. Essentially you trade the freedom to live wherever you want with the ability to stay with your freshman year friends (or that\u2019s the idea in theory). Seems promising on paper although not perfect in practice. More importantly there is good housing for you all four years which may not be the case everywhere else! \n\nI wish I had taken more time to explore classes in different areas that interested me freshman year. I also wish I made more of a consistent effort to make new friends after the first quarter. Also make time every couple of weeks to leave the Stanford bubble so you feel like a person living in the real world again. Apply for research positions and internships early! \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions but also go to Stanford.",

            "comment": "1. No clue tbh but I would assume Wharton has a slight edge because it's Wharton. I highly doubt it's appreciable though and wouldn't let that factor into your decision. Imo the flexibility Stanford offers compared to Penn is invaluable - the majority of students I know have changed their mind on their major here. \n2. MS&amp;E is the hardest coterm to get into I believe because you compete with students outside of Stanford. Afaik acceptance rate is in the 30-40%ish?\n3. The community is pretty welcoming! People are pretty chill in general and not a lot of people are cutthroat. Some clubs are fairly difficult to get into (ASES Bootcamp, BASES Frosh Battalion, Stanford Consulting have around a 15-20ish% acceptance rate(?) which is fairly significant considering you compete with other Stanford students), most are relatively welcoming. I would say to be prepared to compete with other students for some opportunities - a good chunk require applications and not everyone will get them. Some introseminars (introductory, small courses with professors) can be quite challenging - I took an introsem last year and the professor told us they had around a 25%ish acceptance rate. Some summer research programs like CURIS (CS summer research programs) accepted 78/400+ students. Would say to not hesitate with cold-emailing and just keep on shooting your shot - you're probably bound to get something.\n4. Can't comment on this.\n5. Nah lowkey grad students comment on feeling isolated pretty often here.\n6. Dorms are fine: some are definitely better than others but it's luck of the draw tbh. Dorm systems are widely disliked by the community because of the neighborhood system (you're basically stuck in wherever you get placed as your neighborhood).\n\nI would say learn to socialize fall quarter - it's the easiest time to make friends and do try to meet as many people as you can. Also, second the other commenter on applying to internships early - Tech/Finance season starts in the fall and pretty early in the year. Contrary to what everyone says about exploring - do explore, but also make sure you have some plan of what you're doing. I see a lot of people regretting spending their freshman year not knowing what they're doing, and while pivots do happen (ik tons of premed-&gt;CS switches), know that they come with the cost of you being at a disadvantage to your peers.",

            "comment": "MS&amp;E coterm had a 40% acceptance rate last year. \n\nIt can feel competitive or extremely welcoming depending on who you hang out with. It feels a lot more welcoming than my undergrad though so I think it's more welcoming than most ivy+/hypsm schools. There are clubs that are really competitive but they don't even matter and don't even help you that much. There are also a good amount of clubs that are welcoming to anyone so it's hit or miss. You can definetly get into enough to find a community but you probably won't get into the top business club if you don't have prior experience. But other things on campus will help you more than a competitive club anyway\n\nThere are a lot of project bases / applications-based courses - if you come here you should ask around about them because they aren't all well publicized. For example you can do a policy lab at the law school but a lot of undergrads don't know that they can \n\nThere's not more of a grad student focus IMO unless you're talking about TA jobs. And I'm saying that as a grad student, I think it's more undergrad focused or equal at worst.",

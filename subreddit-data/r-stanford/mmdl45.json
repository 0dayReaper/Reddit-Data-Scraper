    "postText": "I think undergrad decisions come out in under an hour, so am posting a little in advance so this gets approved on time. If you\u2019re here before decisions are out: really good luck, and come back in a bit. :)\n\nFirst and foremost, huge congratulations to those who got in. It\u2019s an amazing achievement, and as upperclassmen, we\u2019re super excited to have you on campus\u2014(hopefully IRL campus by the sounds of things)! I think I speak for a lot of us when I say freshmen make up most of my favourite people on campus every year. And freshmen year at Stanford is really special and wonderful for many students here, so I hope you love every minute of it.\n\nIf people are happy to talk to ProFros with questions, maybe those people could comment below\u2014or mods, maybe we could make a bigger thread for that purpose?\n\nSecondly, some advice to those who got in\u2014(everything below here is my opinion, so feel free to ignore it.) 100% celebrate your achievement, but if you come from a more privileged background, do try and be humble and aware of the background that helped get you here. I\u2019m sure you did a ton of work to get to this point, but there\u2019s often a lot of privilege and/or luck involved too, and that\u2019s totally fine\u2014many of us (including me) are here because of unfair advantages we had in early life, and it\u2019s normal. People at Stanford will like you more for being actively aware of this, I promise. You\u2019re also not an imposter, whether you come from a privileged background or not. You all belong here as much as any of us.\n\n(Last piece of advice: remember that some other people are less happy than you right now\u2014colleges can\u2019t accept everyone, and it seems like acceptance rates were especially low this year\u2014so publicly flexing all the Ivies you got into on social media might not be the... kindest thing to do. Again this applies even more if you\u2019re from a more privileged background. And \u201cShould I go to Stanford or Harvard, wow, such a hard decision...\u201d definitely counts as flexing, I\u2019m afraid...)\n\nTo those who didn\u2019t get in to their dream school, Stanford or not: I\u2019m so so sorry. Be aware this system is definitely unfair, biased, and random, so a rejection is very much *not* a statement about you. Everyone says this, but it\u2019s definitively true: the application system is just not at all good. Several Stanford students I know were rejected from every Ivy we applied to, and there is absolutely no reason we could not have been rejected by Stanford too\u2014we were just the lucky ones. So go nail your undergrad, and come back to Stanford for grad school. Then rub it in all the undergrads\u2019 faces. :)",

You ruled the standardized tests.  You led, you were unafraid of not being the popular kid.\n\nYou did great.  You earned that acceptance.\n\nNow, I have three words and with them, the slate will be wiped clean, all those accomplishments will cease to matter, and you will start a new journey:\n\n\u201cWelcome to Stanford!\u201d",

(I\u2019m actually also a 20hr/week TA, so am definitely coping haha.) \n\nWith some planning ahead, you can make sure that your minor fulfils your WAYs that you\u2019d have to do anyway. This makes it very little extra work. In fact, you can even apply your THINK requirement to your minor with some planning, and I did. The more tricky thing is that your M.S. and B.S. classes can\u2019t overlap, so you have to plan for that. This is why I\u2019m a math major\u2014it has a low unit requirement and overlaps less with CS than, for example, an MCS major. I actually changed to math in Junior Spring haha.\n\nFor info, my History minor fulfilled: WAY-SI, WAY-ED, WAY-AII, WAY-ER, THINK. (Every single class was a WAY requirement!)\n\nMy major fulfilled: WAY-FR, WAY-AQR.\n\nThis meant that the only explicit WAYs I had to take outside my major/minor were: WAY-SMA, WAY-CE. \n\nSo basically: by dovetailing your requirements, you can do this pretty easily. This has caveats. This strategy doesn\u2019t work if both your major and minor are humanities, or both STEM. This strategy is definitely easiest with a STEM major and humanities minor, since so many humanities classes fulfil random WAYs. It\u2019s also doable with humanities major and STEM minor, but works less well.",

I probably am going to be a SymSys major, public policy minor (less set on this), and do the MS&amp;E coterm. It looks like the minor and coterm have some overlapping classes -- can these count for both since it's not my major?\n\nAlso, can/do students take classes that they're interested (like gender studies classes) even if they don't relate to any of the degrees I'd be working towards?",

The classes for Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s are like totally separate and disjoint. If a requirement in your Master\u2019s is also required in your Bachelor\u2019s, you\u2019ll have to apply it to one of them only\u2014usually the Bachelor\u2019s\u2014and take some replacement class for your Master\u2019s.\n\nClasses for your major/minor also generally can\u2019t overlap at all, though this is less strict and there are exceptions. One is the Math 50 series which can apply both to a math minor and pretty much every other STEM major.\n\nYeah, you can take basically anything you want. So definitely go take gender studies. :) \n\nAlso, sorry for using jargon so much. TL;DR: WAYs are random gen-ed requirements. You can fulfil WAYs while doing your major/minor, or just by taking random classes. Fulfilling WAYs is usually fun, but they don\u2019t let you petition any courses which can be a nightmare. For example: PhD applied stats doesn\u2019t count for WAY-AQR. Notably AQR stands for \u201capplied quantitative reasoning.\u201d You can\u2019t petition to change this.",

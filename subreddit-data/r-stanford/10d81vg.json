Better lab space?\n\nEarly career transfers are typically downgrades, i.e. when you don't get tenure you transfer to a less prestigious university. This was exclusively the case for Harvard chemistry assistant professors until fairly recently.\n\nLateral or upgrades only happen once you've established a reputation and funding stream that another university wants to poach. Typically, this happens after tenure.",

In part due to special fees, Stanford is incredibly generous with student group funding that makes financial commitments from group members of all income levels more equalized. The alternative, as practiced at some of our peer institutions, includes paying club dues, personally paying for trips/conferences, creating some kind of club business case, going through University bureaucracy to get funding, getting donations from alums directly to clubs, etc. Stanford clubs can\u2014and do\u2014make use of those funding routes, but using them to supplement special fees rather than them being required is a much better system for providing great club experiences for the entire student body. \n\nJust something to consider.",

I am VP of an academic club on campus, and VSO money through ASSU helps us put on workshops for new members, helps us attend competitions and conferences, and have boba and snacks at meetings. Without this fund, as another commenter said, clubs would not be able to provide these kinds of resources without collecting fees from individual members, which disproportionately impacts lower-income individuals.",

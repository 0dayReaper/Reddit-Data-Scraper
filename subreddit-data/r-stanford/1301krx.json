The complaint listed two violations of The Joint Bylaws of the ASSU, which were last* [*updated*](https://assu.stanford.edu/joint-bylaws-of-the-assu/) *in 2014.*\n\n*The first violation related to Chen\u2019s late submission of her campaign expenditures. All candidates were required to file their receipts documenting campaign expenditures by 11:59 p.m. on April 16 through a Google Form sent by Froehlich. Chen submitted her receipts at 12:25 a.m. on April 17, 26 minutes after the deadline.*\n\n*The second complaint alleged Chen\u2019s violation of the $100 spending limit on campaign expenditures \u2014 Chen documented spending $122.75 on materials such as flyers and tape.\"*\n\n\"*Acting Executive Director of the Stanford Constitutional Law Center Rebecca Talbott \u201902, in her personal capacity, told The Daily that she hopes the dispute over Chen\u2019s \u201cminor\u201d violations will be resolved in \u201ca more understanding and less intimidating manner.*\n\n*Talbott said that she believes Chen finds the situation \u201coverwhelming, unfair and breathtakingly disproportionate\u201d as she believes Chen, a college frosh with no legal training, is being forced to \u201cweigh in on highly legalistic questions that she would have no idea how to respond to.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cMy worry is that this experience will prove scary, intimidating, alienating, and spirit-crushing to her, and risk forever dampening the positive, school-spirited, and public-focused energy that prompted her to be a candidate for student senate in the first place,\u201d Talbott said.*\u201d\n\n*\" On April 3, Chen sent her original proposed budget of $640 to Froehlich. According to screenshots* [*included*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vUofDkEgPCyIQZhd3k2ub98rmqxKghnR/view) *in her response to the complaint, Froehlich did not correct or comment on her budget. \u201cI should not be held to a rule by someone who, when given the exact opportunity to correct my misunderstanding, said nothing,\u201d Chen wrote in her response. \"*\n\nHave to agree with Talbott -- very weird they are pushing this hard for this.\n\nEspecially since this is effectivelly a J.D. candidate pursuing action against an undergraduate over 25 minutes of delay and $25 of expenditures. Rules as Intended vs. Rules as Written taken to extremes here.\n\nThe correct action would be noting the violations, so it doesn't go under the radar, but not pushing this far -- the student is a frosh...",

The crazy thing is that virtually everyone who actually cares for patients agrees on this. It\u2019s just the administration that is too near-sighted. \n\nMy guess is that the administration does the right thing here and changes the plan.",

Part of the error here was that nurses and residents are generally young, and thus the algorithm placed them further back in the line.\n\nExposure to COVID should be the major factor in prioritization, but the Health-care worker's age/morbidities should absolutely be factored in (i.e., a 50-yr old nurse should be prioritized over a 30-yr old nurse).",

It's a travesty the leadership doesn't care to excel in anything but research opportunities for faculty, but it's a logical result of the culture they've only brought on themselves by decades of fighting the unions for the lowest labor costs and paltry benefits. Some day an ambitious c-suiter is going to clean house, and it can't come soon enough.",

The market is brutal, and it\u2019s mostly due to the recession. I\u2019m taking summer classes, grinding leetcode and doing more side projects to put on my resume, and besides freshman summer is the only summer you\u2019re not really expected to do anything so go have some fun while you\u2019re at it.",

Assuming it\u2019s not the latter, some things to consider are your body/breath odor (I have met some seriously stinky CS students), how often you cut people off before they\u2019re done speaking (many CS/eng students do this), whether you come off as pompous, etc. I\u2019d say you need to ask a trusted friend/mentor what\u2019s going wrong.",

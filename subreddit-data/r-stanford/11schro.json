            "comment": "It's hard to overstate the harm that a false rape claim causes to our university. I hope the falsely accused man receives support and appropriate restitution (if he wants it).\n\nFor anyone outside Stanford who didn't receive the campus-wide email:\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nDear Stanford community,\n\nWe\u2019re writing to provide an update to you on a sensitive and difficult matter.\n\nMany of you recall that last August, an AlertSU Community Crime Alert was sent out regarding a reported rape in a restroom near a Wilbur Hall parking lot. This was followed by an alert in October, in which an individual reported having been dragged to the basement of a campus building and sexually assaulted there. \n\nIn both of these cases the Department of Public Safety became aware of the reported assault after being notified by a mandatory reporter, and a campus alert was issued because of the possibility of a continuing threat to the community. The Department of Public Safety investigated the reports expeditiously and thoroughly.\n\nKnowing that these reports prompted great concern in our community, we want to share additional information that has now become available.\n\nWe learned today that the Santa Clara County District Attorney\u2019s Office has filed criminal charges against the individual who reported both of these incidents to the mandatory reporter. The charges include two felony counts of perjury and two misdemeanor counts of knowingly inducing another person to give false testimony pertaining to a crime. You can read a statement from the District Attorney\u2019s Office here.\n\nThe individual, a Stanford employee, is on a leave of absence. The university will be reviewing her employment in light of the information shared by the District Attorney\u2019s Office today.\n\nThese false reports are damaging, both for true survivors of sexual assault and for the members of our community who experienced fear and alarm from the reports. We also want to emphasize that both false reports and outcomes such as this one are extremely rare in sexual assault cases. Sexual assault and other sexual offenses regrettably continue to be prevalent both at Stanford and in our broader society. Our steadfast commitment to provide compassionate support for survivors of sexual assault and to prevent these acts from occurring in the first place remains unabated.\n\nOur SHARE Title IX Office and the Department of Public Safety continue to vigorously investigate incidents of sexual violence, and the university is committed to holding accountable those who are found responsible. Our Title IX/Sexual Harassment Annual Report provides data on cases and outcomes.\n\nIf you believe you are the victim of sexual violence at Stanford, please reach out to one of the resources that stand ready to support you. And, more broadly, let us continue working together to create each day the environment of safety and wellbeing that we all wish for our community.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPatrick Dunkley\nVice Provost for Institutional Equity, Access &amp; Community\nCo-Chair, Community Board on Public Safety\n\nLaura Wilson\nDirector, Department of Public Safety",

To me, this is accountability for the AlertSU they sent, in the sense that they are accounting for their actions: here's what they did and why they did it. \n\nConsidering the hard-to-overstate harm, I hope that the leaders of Sexual Violence Free Stanford will account for their opportunistic [Daily op-ed](https://stanforddaily.com/2022/10/12/from-the-community-i-was-sexually-assaulted-stanford-didnt-keep-their-promises/) and [campus protest](https://stanforddaily.com/2022/10/14/protesters-call-for-university-action-on-sexual-violence-demand-justice/). I believe that most people at Stanford (i) want the campus to be free of sexual violence and (ii) wish that victims of sexual violence receive the support they need, including a platform to tell their story. I hope that SVFree will consider apologizing for going to platform with incomplete information on the catalyzing event.",

To me, this is accountability for the AlertSU they sent, in the sense that they are accounting for their actions: here's what they did and why they did it.\n\nI agree that it was critical for the administration to set the record straight, but they didn't really have a choice once the DA's office puts out a press release. Stanford's above email was sent at 5:15pm. The Mercury News first broke the story at 11:30am. I would have been more impressed by the university's statement if it had preceded the newspaper, or at least wasn't 6 hours later.\n\n&gt;Considering the hard-to-overstate harm, I hope that the leaders of Sexual Violence Free Stanford will account for their opportunistic Daily op-ed and campus protest. \n\nThis is all part of the harm - it delegitimizes SVFree's goals and methods. \n\nAs the author of this [Daily op-ed](https://stanforddaily.com/2022/11/17/from-the-community-stanford-medical-school-must-address-sexual-misconduct-by-faculty/) on sexual misconduct by faculty, I know that from the faculty-side of things, the cases of sexual violence and misconduct that are publicly disclosed are just a fraction of what's actually happening. \n\nA false accusation doesn't change that, but it does understandably make those folks who have been spared violence more skeptical, which hinders progress.",

It was at this time that authorities learned that Gries had filed a previous sexual harassment complaint against one of her coworkers, and he happened to fit the description of the alleged rapist.\n&gt;\n&gt;The DA\u2019s office said that Gries told an acquaintance that she was in a relationship with the man. Gries reported that she had been sexually assaulted by the coworker, became pregnant with his twins, and then suffered a miscarriage. The investigation showed that she was not in fact pregnant at that time.\n&gt;\n&gt;On Jan. 24, investigators interviewed Gries, and she allegedly admitted to lying about the rapes before writing an apology letter to the man she falsely accused...\n&gt;\n&gt;The impacts on the man who was falsely accused were also heavy. After discussing the trauma the false claims caused him he said, \u201cThis is disgusting. I don\u2019t feel human. I don\u2019t feel human at all,\u201d according to the DA\u2019s office.",

Then add 50% atop that punishment for deterrence. Make them realize that they will suffer big time for their lies.",

This seems more personal than political - she generally tried to ruin a specific person\u2019s life.  I view that as even worse IMO.  Jussie\u2019s actions were unlikely to destroy someone\u2019s life like her accusations could very likely done.  Neither is acceptable but her actions were worse.",

Can you try to subscribe here without a Stanford email? I'm not sure it's possible. Then you can view the archive. https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/rains-chat\n\nThere's similar lists for postdocs (postdocs-exchange), Munger, EVGR, Escondido etc. I can post them if you can't find them.",

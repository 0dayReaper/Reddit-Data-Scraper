You should talk to your professor now about what you can do to pass because they might be willing to work with you and make a plan to give you more credit. I've heard of professors being helpful with this, but you need to reach out asap.",

Some instructors have additional requirements (like for CS 103 sometimes you have to pass the exams too) but probably not unless it\u2019s a core class",

    "postText": "I've met a lot of Econ majors who have a rigid career structure in mind (2 yrs IB/Consulting -&gt; 2 yrs Private Equity -&gt; MBA etc). What's the typical career trajectory for CS grads (i.e. do most exit out of SWE)? What's the ultimate end-goal (VC, startup etc.)?\n\nI appreciate that there's a tonne of different paths you can take with every career, but I wanted to get a picture of what a long-term career in tech might look like.

            "comment": "There is a pretty linear trajectory in investment banking, since analyst programs are structured with the expectation that most only stay 2 years. In SWE, there is less uniformity and sometimes it\u2019s more normal for people stay in one company for a long time (the idea of \u2018exit opps\u2019 doesn\u2019t figure in most people\u2019s minds because their first career may be somewhere they intend to stay)",

VC is a bit different: an exit helps, and being a successful founder with a big exit is almost a requirement for partner roles, but there\u2019s plenty of \u201cassociates\u201d at basically all these firms.",

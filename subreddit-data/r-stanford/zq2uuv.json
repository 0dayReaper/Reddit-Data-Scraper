I'm from the east coast and was wondering how yall get your stuff to and from campus (ex. a bike)? \n\nI love Stanford, but I'd be lying if I said that the distance wasn't scaring me a little. Any advice regarding long distance travel would be greatly appreciated!!",

Just bring clothes and personal stuff with you.\n\nMy son is a sophomore. We flew out from New York a few days before his orientation running around finding a bike and picking up things like bedding and towels. He and some friends shared a storage unit last summer and will do the same going forward. \n\nIt seems overwhelming at first but it all works out.\n\nCongrats on your acceptance!!",

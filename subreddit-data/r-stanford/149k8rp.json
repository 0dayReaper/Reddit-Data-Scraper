    "postText": "Hey everyone! I am an undergrad at stanford and I am really interested in their dual degree JD/Phd program. I was looking at the requirements and the law school allows you to submit a GRE or LSAT and the GRE is mandatory for the Phd program. Should I focus on the GRE to get the highest score I can and submit it to the law school and the phd program? Or should I take both? An undergrad advisor told me I won\u2019t be competitive without the lsat score but what if i keep a high gpa and really work on ECs and research? Any advice would help!  Also, most of the schools i want to apply to for the dual degree have this same policy for the gre and lsat.",

I completely revised my studying habits, went to office hours and tried to actually make sure I truly understand everything, formed some study groups with friends and made sure we try to test each other on the knowledge in the class. Ended up with an A- at the end of that class. Graduated with my ChemE degree.",

Students who learn the types of problems and how to solve the problem. They learn by patterns, memorization, and heuristics around various types of problems and how to approach them. I.e. I see problem type A, I use formula type A, algorithm type A and solve this.\n2. Students who learn by conceptually understanding the fundamentals. They rarely have to memorize things, and prefer to have a good understanding of how one concept relate to another. I see problem type A, it relates to foundational concept Y, and Z, which can be derived and shifted in this way and combining Y and Z.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe challenge with OChem (and a lot of college science classes) is that you actually need to do a bit of both. You need the memorize the reaction mechanisms and the heuristics (those are your tools), and you need to understand how fundamental concepts on how reaction mechanisms relate to each other (how to use those tools).Generally, in HS, you can get away with being very strong type 1 or type 2 science student. I was a type 2 science learner, and I really had to sit down and memorize all the reaction mechanics. It was VERY painful and difficult for me, but ultimately I learned a lot from the experience.\n\nAlso, HIT THE OFFICE HOURS. They are there for a reason. Unlike HS, you aren't quizzed every week to check how well you mastered each concept. That's up to you. Make sure you fully understand the concepts by going to office hours. Just don't be one of those kids that tries to get all the PSET answers by annoying the TA endlessly. Use them as a resource to further your understanding and clarify anything you don't get.\n\nAlso, remember you are ultimately here to learn and grow, not to get a 4.3 GPA.",

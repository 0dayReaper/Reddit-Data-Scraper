    "postText": "Hey guys, would love some insight. I\u2019m trying to get a clinical research assistant coordinator position and it\u2019s been about two months since I initially applied in November. I haven\u2019t heard back although I do have various experience in the niche topic of research and a graduated university student. I figure they have lots of people applying and it takes awhile to sort through. \n\nIn the career listing it has the name of the supervisor/professor I would be working directly under if I was hired for the position. I was curious to know if it would be a good idea to reach directly out to that professor and get acquainted, if that bettered my chances of hearing back. They do not have any contact information posted on the job listing BUT if I look up the professors name I can find his academic email, his studies, his scientific articles, etc. \n\nDo you think this would be a good idea? What would be something professional and conversation provoking to say when reaching out? \n\nAny input is welcome. I am out of state resident but am relocating if that helps at all. Thank you!",

These things move slowly, and the holiday season only compounds the delays. Just sit tight and apply to other jobs. If you like, reach out to the hiring manager or admin handling the position to get an update\u2014that will be more helpful than emailing the PI directly.",

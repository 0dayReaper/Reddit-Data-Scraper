    "postText": "I'm a rising Senior, super passionate regarding Mathematics, going into this year's SUMaC for algebraic topology, and I've taken a Stanford ULO course in the past and loved it. Problem is, I'm debating on whether to self study additional math courses, to take them in community colleges, or take Stanford University Level Online courses.\n\nI understand that the ULO courses offers continuing studies credits, which doesn't exactly contribute much to skipping past prerequisites itself; the steep cost of the program also isn't enough to justify taking it for fun, since I can do so at a community college or on my own. Even enrolling in it for the shallow reason of college admissions doesn't work, as Stanford doesn't consider demonstrated interest.\n\nI would like some advice on whether I should take the courses or not, and how much it is actually valued compared to the latter options. If I am going to enroll to it, I'm planning to tick off every single course in the list by the end of Senior year, so I wanted to take careful consideration before I commit to this. Thank you!",

Obv I can\u2019t speak to your chances of getting into Stanford but you\u2019re right that they don\u2019t care much about demonstrated interest. I think it\u2019s just good to learn the material and if you can get it for official units even better but no real reason to pay for it. Also would say there are probably other things you can do that will bolster your application more for Stanford and other elite math universities than just taking courses.",

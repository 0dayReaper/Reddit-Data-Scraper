I know my question\u2019s vague, just wanted to get a better feel for what majoring in math at Stanford sounds like.\n\nEdit: I guess while I'm at it, any general advice for a Stanford prefrosh would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "This is what I'm doing!\n\nWhat I'd say:\n\nDefinitely take 60's series CM or DM if you can, it's definitely a lot of work, but totally worth it in terms of preparing you for 100's level math classes, and they're super interesting classes where you can get to know the professors (I'm partial to CM personally). If you already have the background to go into 100's level courses, I might still recommend taking it just in terms of meeting other math-y people \u2014 I know one kid who def didn't need 61 for the content, but was very glad he took it anyways to meet other math people. (he also took complex analysis, so didn't just do 61). I definitely didn't have the backgrounds for a 100's level math class coming in, but was definitely prepared after the 60's series\n\nGenerally going against the grain here, but would say that the pure math courses are a lot more interesting than the applied math ones \u2014 outside-of-the-department math-related courses tend to operate at a much more surface level, at least in my experience, and tend to get kinda boring. General rule of thumb I've seen is that if you can do the pure math courses you should definitely be able to do other math courses without too much trouble, but this doesn't necessarily hold the other way around. However, it is true that the EE dept does have certain courses that are the gold standard, esp in linalg and optimization. But other than that exception, I would argue that you should interpret \"the best math courses are outside the math department\" mean \"math outside the math department is easier\", which tends to be true; the classes tend to be taught at a slower pace and less rigorously, but I would argue don't prepare you as well for other classes/general life, and are also just less interesting.\n\nWould disagree that the pure math courses are mostly for people going to grad school \u2014 I'm definitely not planning on grad school, but still prefer the pure math classes \u2014 they're just generally more interesting to me. And generally, the advantage is if you can do well in pure math classes, any other math-adjacent class in other departments (e.g. every stats class and certain CS classes) should be relatively easy comparatively, at least in my experience. The stats courses that I've taken especially are pretty much a cake-walk if you have done any serious mathematics (i.e for STATS 200 I watched half of the lectures for the first time on 2x speed the day before the final exam, and still got like a 96 on the final).\n\nWill concur that professors can be a bit hit or miss \u2014 but overall would still say they're quite good. It's generally not classes that are good or bad, but rather professors who make the class good or bad; A class can suck one year and be amazing the next depending on who's teaching it. So definitely pay attention to course reviews for a specific professor \u2014 although it's a bit complex as ratings won't tell you everything, as a lot of it is down to what teaching style you prefer. Generally, though I've only had one professor I actively didn't like, and many I did like, and I could have easily avoided the one I didn't like had I paid attention to class reviews. Best advice is to get the scoop from upperclassmen on who's good and who's bad.\n\nThe math major is beautiful because it's so light \u2014 the general plan for most is 10 units AP Calc BC credit, 15 units intro series (either 51, 52, 53 or 61, 62, 63), which most math majors tend to do their frosh year, at least in what I've seen, 8 other math courses at 4 units each, and then 15 units of electives, which are pretty broad (there's a list of what counts on the math dept website). This basically means that if you do the intro series frosh year, you only have to take one math class a quarter to finish the major, in addition to a couple electives.\n\nTwo \"series\" that a lot of math majors tend to take earlier on are 120, 121 (abstract algebra) and 144, 147 (topology) {122 also exists but fewer people take it iirc}. Would also definitley recommend 116, especially if Eliashberg is teaching it (anything he teaches is amazing imo, but he can be a bit polarizing). Tadashi is also supposed to be really good.\n\nAlso, as a general small bit of advice, courses with good lecture notes are just infinitely superior, so that's something to pay attention to if you can. Although this is kind of a me problem because I have trouble getting out of bed and going to class on time lmao.\n\nAs for CS coterm, this has already been said I think, but any courses taken frosh year cannot count towards your coterm, so just keep that in mind. Generally, the route for the CS coterm starts by taking the CS core (106B, 107, 110, 103, 109, 161), but you don't necesarily have to limit yourself to that \u2014 personally I can't stand systems so I'm not taking either 107 or 110 until I have to \u2014 but other than 106B they are requirements for the coterm degree I believe, and likely would be advantageous to have for a coterm application (although with a good GPA the cs coterm application is quite easy, I've heard) , so just keep that in mind. Also, I've heard that taking any higher level course can always substitute a requirement for a lower level course, but I don't have direct experience with that. Would say that math majors tend to find a lot of these classes easier than most, especially 106B (intro class), but have also heard anecdotally that 161 (algorithms) is also not bad if you come from a math background. Would also recommend subbing out CS 109 (probability) for Math 154 or Stats 116, as it's kind of surface level and not very rigorous, and could be a bit boring. 103 (proofs in cs) is totally unnecessary if you come from a math background, and the dept reccomends you do 154 instead if you have that background iirc. Generally, if you're more interested in AI/ML, you won't need any non-ml prereqs other than calc and probability, and 229 is a good place to start imo.\n\nTLDR, Math Major + CS Coterm is a great combination @ stanford, generally has super cool classes + allows for a lot of flexibility. You're not locked in until end of soph year, but would def recommend this as a path worth exploring at the very least!",

From what I understand from your response, math majors are required to begin with the intro series which is either the MATH 50 or 60 series, the latter being more challenging (?). And one needs to choose one of either the 60CM or 60DM series, right?

                            "comment": "Yep you pretty much got it! It's not a requirement to begin with the intro series, but I would say the vast majority do so. I would say the only reason not to is if you're coming in with a super strong math background to the point where the intro series is all repeat knowledge, but generally would say that's a very limited subset of people.\n\nAs for 50's vs 60's, both are 3 unit long sequences, and it's very common (not just for math majors, but for lots of STEM people) to do one each in fall, winter, spring frosh year so as to complete the series early. This is a bit of a generalization, but 51/61 is focused on linalg (although 61 has more of a calc and analysis component), 52/62 is multivariable and vector calc, and 53/63 is diff eq. While I would the majority of math majors do this fall/winter/spring frosh year as described, you definitely don't have to. 51 is a prereq for 52 and 53 I believe, but 52 is not a prereq for 53, and it's the same for the 60's where 61 is a prereq for 62 and 63 but that's it. So, you can get a bit flexible with the ordering if you want. That being said, keep in mind that 61 is only offered in the fall, 62 is only offered in the winter, and 63 is only offered in the spring, whereas 51/52/53 are pretty much offered every quarter, so it's a lot more difficult to play around with the ordering of the 60 series, and I don't really know anyone who took it who didn't just take the whole thing straight thru as a series.\n\nThe difference between the two is primarily that the 60 series is proof-based, whereas the 50's series is not, but there's a bit more to it than that. The 60's series is definitely a lot more work and just a lot more difficult in general in terms of content and exams and homework; That being said, if you like math, which I'm guessing you do haha, the 60 series will likely be a lot more interesting. Plus, the 60's series is much more like what you'll see in other math classes (in terms of teaching style, being proof based), whereas the 50 series is not; If this gives any info, IIRC the 60's series used to be called 50H, where the H meant honors, so the idea is its sort of an honors version of the 50 series. Other advantages of the 60's series is that you do enough analysis so that a lot of times you can get out of analysis prereqs for certain classes, i.e. 116, which is super nice. Also, the classes tend to be a lot smaller, whereas 51/52/53 are giant, lecture style classes, iirc 62 and 63 only had like 12-15 people in them, so you can actually get to know the professor and other people in your class, which is super nice (61 can have a fair bit of people, but lots of them drop. IIRC we started with like 60 and ended with like 30, and then a lot of them didn't continue to 62). Overall, if you're a math person, I would definitely recommend going with the 60's series if you can; It's super cool to be able to get to know professors, and the classes are super interesting (especially compared to the 50's which can be super bland) and prepare you well for other math classes, and really just any other STEM classes in general. It's also nice to get to know other math people.\n\nAs for CM vs DM, CM focuses on continuous stuff whereas DM focuses on discrete stuff. You do have to choose one, but can sort of mix and match between quarters (i.e. take 61CM but 62DM, or vice versa). A lot of people from my year took 62CM but 63DM because Tadashi was teaching 63DM. Generally staying within the same series will probably be a bit easier in terms of having the proper prereq knowledge, but you can switch for sure if you want to. I would recommend CM for no other reason than I took it and liked it haha but they're both good, just depends on what you're interested in\n\nYou can also definitely take 120 series or 144 series freshman year! A decent amount of people do so, esp if they have strong math backgrounds coming in. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that sometimes the math dept schedules one of them overlapping with the 60's series, i.e. this year 121 is at the same time as 62 which is quite annoying to all my frosh math friends haha. (they also usually do this with  Math 151 {probability} which is often at the same time as 62). Generally, based on past trends, it doesn't seem like 144/147 has this problem, but you never know for sure until they publish course schedules, so just keep an eye out for that. But a lot of people also take them sophomore year, and doing so doesn't really put you behind imo, so it's really just about how much math you want to take at a given time and how much fits in your schedule.",

There are a lot of good CS and EE courses which imo are far better for applied math/stats and for some reason EE has the best linear algebra and convex optimization courses (eg EE 263, EE 364A, and CS 229).\n\nFor frosh, depending on your background you can take the 50 series, 60 DM series, 60 CM series, or just skip and go straight to something like 120 which is a popular option for those with robust backgrounds. Also, the math major in general is super light in terms of required courses. You can basically take anything you want and they'll count it, so just find courses you're interested in. The last thing to note is that if you're interested in doing a CS coterm, you can't count CS courses from your frosh year for the coterm so make sure you schedule them well.",

In my opinion it's a bit of a disservice to undermine all of that and say that the \"best math classes are not taught by the math department.\" If someone's majoring in math, they have some appreciation and interest in the beauty of mathematics - some of the best courses that reflect that are, indeed, taught by the math department. (Some I would recommend are 116, 121, 159.)",

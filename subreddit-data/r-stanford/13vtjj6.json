    "postText": "I believe this is relevant to Stanford since the venue is inside the campus. I was just asking how the Frost Amp venue is because I'm somewhat interested to attend the Billy Strings N1/N2 in Stanford in Oct 2023(later this year). Unsure of how the venue is if former students or current students or alumni have been there for shows. \n\nI'm unsure of how the surrounding area of Stanford, Palo Alto is because I've been looking around for hotels that are not insanely expensive and been looking at SFO or SJC or OAK as airports to fly into from Texas. \n\nAlso was wondering how the ride share would be post-show if you all have a bar or restaurant on campus I could wait and get a burger or beer and just chill till the ride share just levels out",

Lots of young people and good food, but you\u2019d need to Uber or take Caltrain between them. SF/Oakland/Berkeley is probably more lively (Caltrain/Caltrain+Bart goes there if you want)",

Hotels around there run around $100 / night for decent 3 star places, and even after adding on the cost of ubering to Stanford will still be cheaper than finding an equivalent hotel in Palo Alto. Plus, if you fly into SJC your hotel will be closer to your airport too, so the costs even out a bit.",

Most people bring picnic blankets or camping chairs, I don\u2019t think there are benches. I think there is also a standing area closer to the stage but I\u2019m too old to enjoy crowding in for shows anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s a really chill vibe, kinda feels like you\u2019re just in a nice park enclosed by trees. Might not be the best for certain types of music but I think they try to program accordingly and Billy Strings should be awesome. Good luck OP!",

I mean I was at Tx Christian Univ in 2010 and 2011 and the fall concerts we had(Lady Antebellum 2010, The Fray 2011) was just in the Campus Commons grounds which was just an open air grounds near the student center. There was no floor/grass just standing which sucks after a while. At least here at Stanford there are grounds in the grass you can sit.\n\nI believe its sitting on the steps around the grass area. Unsure how the floor/pit will be for Billy Strings show because the super fan Billy fans try so hard to get to the rail/pit at shows. I'm not really into the pit or want to shout out to the stage and would rather stand here and there or sit",

That is about the only drinking establishment that will be open on campus at the time the concert would probably end, and the food and drinks are pretty good (but expensive!). \n\nTAP (The Axe and Palm) is also open late, usually until 1:30-2 am. It\u2019s probably 10 ish minutes walk from Frost. The food is terrible AND expensive though. There is no alcohol at TAP, just sports bar-type food. \n\nFor hotels, I would recommend Creekside Inn in Palo Alto.",

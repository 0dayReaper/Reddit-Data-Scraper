    "postText": "Hi! I am admitted to the MSCS program and I know there's no guaranteed funding for master's students. However, I know there are CA, TA and RA ships which cover tuition and living expenses.\n\n1. Is it reasonable to count on these oportunities to fund my entire masters studies? \n\n2. Do these opportunities cover what I mentioned or do they cover something else?\n\n3. General advice on funding? I'm looking for opportunities so I can study debt free.\n\nThanks in advance",

The 50% TAship is full tuition for 9-10 credits and provides a stipend of $10k per quarter.\n\n\n3. Best bet is a TAship; some MS students do have RAships, but they\u2019re very rare since they are, as a rule, reserved for doctoral students.",

There are benefits to all three paths and with such a high ROI on CS degrees you can safely pursue any path, although obviously the ideal is to get in and out without $100k in debt.",

Would recommend sticking with one class a quarter\u2013 maybe 2 if you're prepared to deal with an extremely high workload for several months continuously. I'd say worst part of doubling as a SWE/student is that deadlines often collide with each other (majorly quarterly deadline due at the same time as class final project, or someone pages you for help with a production incident while you're deep in thought on a hw assignment). Have been a few weeks where I'd work until 1am straight just to wake up at 8am again the next day and do the same ad nauseum.\n\nOverall would do a part-time MS with work again; having a tech salary to support yourself as a student helps. Will definitely impede your social/personal life though\u2013 there have been weeks where I just dropped off the radar and could not regularly hang out with friends due to deadlines.

SIEPR has great opportunities for undergrads interested in economics, see [here](https://siepr.stanford.edu/programs/undergraduate-student-opportunities). If you're taking classes with profs in the department, stop in at office hours and ask them about their research/if they're looking for undergraduate research assistants. Having CS experience (even just 106A) will be helpful.",

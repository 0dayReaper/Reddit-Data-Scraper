            "comment": "The challenge in answering this question is that only a tiny number of transfer students (we're talking single digits per year at most) would have experienced both a liberal arts college and Stanford undergrad. What I can tell you is that a lot of students at other universities (especially UCs) mock Stanford for how much hand-holding there is of undergrads. How that compares to LACs I couldn't tell you. Congratulations on having such great choices - you're literally picking between Stanford and the best LACs in the country!",

            "comment": "I went to a LAC and then Stanford for grad school so I can\u2019t speak from direct experience as an undergraduate at Stanford. That said, while at Stanford I taught many undergrads (first as a TA, then as an early career academic) and the attention to undergrad teaching and learning (by faculty and admin) really paled in comparison to my experience as a LAC undergrad. As a TA I was told by quite a few undergrads that I was the first instructor they had at Stanford that really seemed to care about their learning and it broke my heart. I mean I am a good teacher but nothing amazing. But I did model my teaching style after my amazing undergraduate professors (and I never had a TA), which is something. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are amazing faculty at Stanford who care about undergrads but it\u2019s just not what\u2019s incentivized (as at most R1 institutions). And, to be certain, there are opportunities at Stanford that you may not have at LACs but if I could do it again I wouldn\u2019t change anything. \n(I also had an amazing time as a Stanford graduate student so maybe I\u2019m just strange!)",

I received similar comments as a TA/instructor to what rw0804 observed above -- that my class was the first time students received substantial feedback on their writing, or my class was one of the few smaller classes where they knew the instructor well enough for a letter of rec, etc. On the upside, as an English major at Stanford you'll likely have smaller classes than many STEM-focused students. I'd also say that weather + nearness to family could be important considerations (things I didn't think about till I was already a student, having to fly cross-country a lot...) Happy to talk more around any other specific questions!",

The pre health committee at Amherst is amazing and they help you every step of the way starting from your freshmen year. Starting your first year they meet with you 1-on-1 every semester to check in on you and get to know you. This helps them write amazing committee letters for every premed student. The classes can be hard but all of the professors want and love to help you succeed. I was so lost in my orgo class at some point and my professor literally met with me 1-on-1 every week to answer all my questions. that is the norm for professors not the exception. additionally we have no grad students which means you have ample research opportunities (which helps for med school apps). i cannot recommend Amherst enough!! I took several English classes as well. We have an amazing English department and there are even a few English classes that intersect well with premed stuff (ie: Representing Illness ENGL125). Hope this helps!! Feel free to ask me other questions :)",

I've a lot of friends at graduate school now (Stanford is incidentally a very popular destination), and the common sentiment I hear is appreciation for starting at Pomona for undergrad. LACs are remarkable in the distinctive experiences they provide every moment you're there: things you can't quantify in comparative numbers, but you feel the deep impact of once you've left. \n\nIt's a tough decision to make, but you can't go wrong with any of the four.

None of the profs I've had are here to get published and they're all extremely impressive and famous in their fields and are thus veryyy well connected (and are always very willing to help their students network). What I like about Stanford profs is that they are usually very well-established in their fields and teach on the side for fun or teach after retirement so it's always extremely inspiring to hear their career paths. I also recall that Stanford pays their professors the highest out of any college so naturally they hire the best in each field. I would argue that the profs at lacs most likely tried to pursue a career in education from the start and don't have the network/connections that profs at Stanford do.",

You only have 4 years of college so you want to really start enjoying it from the get go and feel like you can be yourself, do the activities you wanna do, take the classes you want, instead of worrying about whether you fit in, whether you made the right choice, etc. You want to go to a college that feels like a \u201chome\u201d for you and where you believe you can thrive and find your people.",

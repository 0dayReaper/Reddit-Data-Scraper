    "postText": "Thinking of doing either 161 or 221, prospective SymSys major with AI concentration (maybe leave things open to CS coterm?) so 161 wouldn\u2019t really count for anything and is mainly for marketability/potential SWE interview purposes. I\u2019m really eager to do 221 though and am very excited to formally get a headstart in AI coursework, but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s pretty challenging and involves algorithmic analysis covered in 161. Does anyone have any advice? Original plan was to do 161 spring and 221 fall next year.",

            "comment": "Take my advice with a grain of salt (YMMV), but I took both of these classes and 161 was definitely more challenging for me. I don\u2019t know if 161 is crucial for doing well in 221 (although I took 161 before 221 and 221 does cover some algorithms that would be easier to understand if you had the context from 161). I felt that 221 is more of a survey/introduction AI class. \n\nHowever, since 161 is being taught by Mary Wootters this spring (have heard good things about her classes), you may want to take it with her while you can, since I feel that a good instructor can make a huge difference in your experience. The content is 161 is interesting (to me at least) and useful for developing a solid foundation in CS and I think it\u2019s a worthwhile class to devote your time to.",

            "comment": "I did both 161 and 221. It\u2019s been a few years since I graduated but 161 is basically a math class. Most of the class is proofs by induction and the assignments is writing pseudo code. You\u2019ll be writing proofs and calculating big O and runtimes.\n\n221 on the other hand has a heavy programming component. 221 will cover more implementation, but of course they also teach you theory. It\u2019s also a broad AI class and covers various topics but not too much in depth. Basically it was one assignment per topic when I took it.\n\nIn my experience, you don\u2019t need 161 to take 221. If you\u2019ve taken 106B, they cover a good amount of algorithms that you can expect to implement in 221. However for learning, I\u2019d say definitively take 161 it\u2019s one of the best classes Stanford has to offer imo and Mary was one of my favorite professors.",

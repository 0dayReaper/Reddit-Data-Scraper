    "postText": "Hi,\nI am a PhD student from Italy and I'm visiting San Francisco for a scientific conference from 19 to 25 of June 2023.\nSince I am a fan of professor Robert Sapolsky, I would like to attend one of his lessons. \nIn Italy is possible to attend any university lesson or lecture for free, even if you are not enrolled at University. Could I do the same in Stanford?\nIf so, where could I check the timetables of lectures to know if and when professor Sapolsky is having a talk, a lecture, or conference in one of these days? \nIs there an internal website, or should I write to someone? \n\nThanks for the answers in advance,\nBest regards",

And Sapolsky has no classes in the Summer quarter.\n\nIn general, I\u2019d suggest emailing the professor to ask if you can attend his lecture. Its free here too, and you can get the schedule in explorecourses.Stanford.edu",

If you're not a Stanford student then you won't have an ID card which is essential for accessing laundry rooms and most buildings (most likely including your residence). Also if anything goes wrong/you need a repair then you'll need Stanford login credentials (aka a sunet) to submit fix-it tickets, etc.",

In other words, there is not housing to sublet, even in violation of university policy.",

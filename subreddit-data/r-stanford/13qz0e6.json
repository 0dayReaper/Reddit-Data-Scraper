    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI'm considering taking CSE 161 (Algorithms) from Stanford Online over the summer. (I'm entering the CSE MS program at UCSD in the fall and looking to pick up some prereqs before entering.) Some questions for anyone who has done this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I've not been able to get into UCSD's CSE 101 (Algorithms) but I am able to get a spot in SDSU's CS 460. Interestingly, what seems to be the same basic class costs $900 at SDSU (San Diego State), $1400 at UCSD and $7000 at Stanford. Do you think it's really \\~ 8x better than the version at SDSU? Maybe the prestige of a degree from Stanford might be worth it, but I'm skeptical that a single class would be worth it. \n2. Someone pointed out to me that it might be worth it if there were a lot of opportunity for social/career networking. Is this possible in the class? Is there a lot of opportunity for collaboration, and bonding with potential/budding Si Valley big whigs?\n\nThanks for your opinion!",

Actually, the summer version of CS 161 is full of freakishly smart high school kids with a smattering of grad students. There aren't any group projects, anyway, unlike in other CS courses, so that limits the opportunities to collaborate with other students to begin with.",

            "comment": "If you were getting your MS degree from Stanford versus UCSD, then I think such a large prestige cost premium may be justifiable.\n\nHowever, if it's just a single class, I don't think you should pay significantly more just to take the undergraduate version of the class at Stanford. I also say this as someone who has taken it and really enjoyed it. No employer (or PhD program) will care whether you took it at Stanford versus UCSD. The more important metric would be how much you learned.\n\nThat being said, if you end up finding the UCSD or SDSU's classes lacking in quality or depth, you can check out Professor Tim Roughgarden's 161 lectures (his website lists them [here](https://timroughgarden.org/videos.html)). He used to teach 161 at Stanford before moving to Columbia, but he has a free online edX version that I've also watched a few lectures from. Professor Roughgarden is a fantastic lecturer and explainer.\n\nHe recently published a series of textbooks that are cheap (\\~$15 per volume and there are 4 volumes), very well-written, and simple to read. These texts were written to complement his 161 class, and you can find it here: [http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/](http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/)",

            "comment": "Take the SDSU course... $7k is waay too much for a summer class lol and if the course credit is gonna be evaluated the same regardless of the uni, then the cheapest makes fiscal sense.\n\nThere might be a small case for the UCSD course only bc the hw, lectures and assignments might be the same as the ones used in the fall/spring quarters so that might be good prep work in terms of academic rigor. If you're going there for your masters, then it might be good to take the same class offered by the same uni. But if you wanna learn the stuff quickly and get the credits done, then SDSU seems like the most straightforward answer.",

The thing that would help me is housing option.\n\n1.\nI've heard that Stanford gives incoming grad students priority for assigning dorms. is it right?\n\n2. I am considering regular sized studio option (budget issue). Do you think it is okay as shown in webpage?\n\n3. Once I start living in Studio room, if i am satisfied with it, can I stay there for several years?\n\n+ This is not related to housing options, but do you think $3,000 is enough for living in Stanford? I want to know your thoughts, experience, and anything!!\n\nYour comments will help me a lot!!",

If you really want to take classes, you can get similar content at a local college or university. Otherwise it's probably a better use of your summer time pursuing a hobby, doing research, or going to one of the free selective camps.",

But content wise, you can easily self study from the syllabus and cover a lot more over the same the same the, so yeah!\n\nI'd suggest not doing it and trying to take part in some 'meaningful' ecs, such as trying to learn more about a subject, reaching out to local professors about research opportunities, relevant internships, etc.",

The best use of your summer is to stay at home and write some open source software. Maybe contribute to one of your favourite pieces of open source such as Mozilla Firefox or whatever else you're using. That's a much better use of your time, and will have a big impact towards your future CS career if you pursue that major after all.",

It's a great program where I met a lot of great people and gave me an experience of living in a dorm in the US as an international. I won't say it will give you any specific boost in your college applications because I don't think it's especially selective but it is a very fun way to spend your summer.",

If you\u2019re good enough in the class and let the coach know your interest it\u2019s possible to walk on that way. But, as others have said, it\u2019s not very likely because Stanford is one of the best teams in the country. My freshman year they had 5 of the top 20 recruits in the country. I had some D1 offers but wasn\u2019t even a top 200 recruit. I did the class a couple times but was never close to being able to walk on. One guy I played with on the club team (who was phenomenal) walked on for 1 year but never got any playing time. Good luck, but know it\u2019s an uphill battle.",

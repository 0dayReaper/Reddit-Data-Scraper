    "postText": "Stanford is wealthier than some small countries, but still reduces undergrads\u2019 financial aid dollar for dollar if a student\u2019s outside scholarships exceed a certain amount. This is some absolute bull and I\u2019m still salty about it even though I am now an old and cranky recent alum. However, stick it to them in the smallest of ways and get a free or reduced price laptop in the process. Find the \u201cComputer Expense Form\u201d on the financial aid website, follow the instructions, and soften the blow of them literally stealing your sweet sweet third-party scholarship money. And never forget that the Stanford football coach, David Shaw, makes a $4 million salary while directly contributing literally nothing to the intellectual pursuits of the school (except attracting some awesome student athletes! respect to you all). ASK STANFORD FOR MORE MONEY ALWAYS. Budget constraints my ass. \n\nThank you for coming to my rant. Here is the form. Get off my lawn, Persis. \nhttps://financialaid.stanford.edu/pdf/computer_v2.pdf",

I had no idea this program existed.\n\nAnd since the \"salty boi\" OP mentioned Coach Shaw's salary, here's a tl;dr for the complexities of the endowment: \n\n* David Shaw is currently the Bradford M. Freeman Director of Football\n\n\n* This is a permanently endowed position, which means that a lot of money was given a while ago by Mr. Freeman to pay out the head football coach's salary for as long as the university exists\n\n\n* This money literally cannot be used for another purpose, based upon the agreement of the original donation, so using the salary for comparison is a false equivalency",

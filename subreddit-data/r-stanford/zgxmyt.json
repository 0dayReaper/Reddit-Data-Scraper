    "postText": "Hey, My name is Francesco Bacci. I am a PhD student (queer and male) currently based in Sunnyvale, but I will be a visiting scholar at Stanford until June (I have a J1 VISA).  \nI was supposed to move to a new place on-campus in January, but things changed unexpectedly and without any respectful warning.\n\nI am doing research on American literature, but I am really struggling to find a solution near Stanford or on-campus. I am Italian (I can cook Pizza!), I am super easygoing, and clean and I need to work on my dissertation (so no crazy lifestyle). I am vaccinated, and I have lived for so long with housemates. I can navigate so many different situations. My main priorities are always communication, being friendly but also respectful of others' spaces. I love cinema, art, and cats. Let me know if you would consider me for your room! Short-term or long-term solutions are ok.\n\nThanks! Francesco",

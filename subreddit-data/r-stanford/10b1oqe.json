UChicago students = stressed and depressed, displaying it\n5. Stanford students = stressed and depressed, hiding it\n\nThe vibe is more competitive/professional at Stanford, and more weird/intellectual at UChicago. Stanford has a lot of 'dreamers', UC has a lot of 'thinkers'. Also, keep in mind the writer only spent their first year at UC, when classes are easier.",

For example, Uchicago student returning from his Internship in the city last year got killed by a random bullet through the train\u2019s window. \n\nThe campus is literally located in one of the most dangerous parts of Chicago. Everything seems better than Stanford until you actually have to live there.",

Anyhow, the student\u2019s criticisms pertain more to the differing social atmospheres, and given that they are a transfer who has experienced life at both UChicago and here, they\u2019re one of the few who are actually qualified to comment on this.\n\nThe comments about learning are asinine though; taking cool classes has been one of my favorite things here. I\u2019m surprised they fit in at UChicago, which is more academic than Stanford.",

He mentioned that the UChicago administration is trying too hard to become like Harvard and is killing the school's quirky intellectual vibe. This sounds a lot like Stanford. I wouldn't surprised if administrations at highly academic schools are working to protect the brand at the cost of fun student culture.",

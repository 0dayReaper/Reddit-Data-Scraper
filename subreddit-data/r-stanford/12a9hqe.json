Not entirely sure but yale STEM seems to be overall easier to get a higher GPA in (this is literally from hearing one person talk about their premed friends at yale and saying \"they have never worried about their grades\" and reading a quora post where a guy said Stanford chem is tough -- somebody please corroborate or challenge this)\n\n\\- lower med school acceptance rate than yale, heard the premed advising is so-so (also if anybody knows please lmk if this is actually true)\n\n\\- literally any major --&gt; CS pipeline\n\n\\- I like bio but I really wanted to major in molecular bio/biochem and Stanford only has a bio major -- not that big of a deal since I can take the same classes as most mol bio/biochem majors at other places but just kinda irksome\n\n\\- Quarter system (though maybe this is also a pro? but once you do poorly in a class it's hard to get your grade up)\n\nYALE\n\nPros\n\n\\- culture seems much nicer, love the residential college system\n\n\\- easier (I think?) premed life in terms of grades \u2014 if anybody knows anything about the rigor of the STEM classes (especially orgo) plz let me know\n\n\\- I've also always wanted to live in NYC and if I go to Yale it's highly likely I'll end up staying on the east coast (hopefully?)\n\n\\- higher med school acceptance rate\n\nCons\n\n\\- far from family\n\n\\- pretty bad STEM program lol \n\n\\- New Haven/location\n\n\\- weather",

            "comment": "Was Pre-Med a good chunk of my freshman year so hopefully can address some things about Stanford (can't comment on Yale though).\n\nFor one, wouldn't really count on GPA boost for A+'s (at least, not with Pre-Med classes). You truly have to be exceptional to get an A+ in a Pre-Med course. General rule of thumb is that the classes are generally curved to a median B, with 1 SD above being an A and 1 SD below being a C, but the curves are relatively unknown.\n\nDuck syndrome is incredibly real. When I was a pro-fro I remember thinking that it would be exaggerated, but it's definitely true. I'm always surprised by people's work ethic. As for flake culture, would say that people flake a lot, but I feel like teenagers/young adults in general tend to be more flaky.\n\nStanford Chem is decently tough but not outrageously so imo. Sometimes they're kinda rude (I wasn't given an extension for a PSET after I got a concussion, which was dick-ish of them ngl), but I think generally they're fair. Definitely a decent amount of work and the Chem classes are known to be some of the tougher classes here.\n\n\\+1 for the any major -&gt; CS pipeline. A TON of people I know came in as Pre-Med and switched to CS after a year or so. Me personally, I went from Pre-Med to Symbolic Systems, which isn't quite the same, but the flexibility of choosing/switching majors was a huge plus for me.",

            "comment": "Consider looking into the research labs at both institutions. Many premeds end up doing research either because it\u2019s something that genuinely interests them or because it is a soft requirement for some med schools (Stanford Med like to see some research). Which of the schools has more researchers studying things that interests in you? My impression is that Stanford has a smaller body of faculty but they\u2019re all heavy hitters in their fields.\n\nIn the biomedical sciences, Stanford is especially strong in stem cell biology,  genetics and gene therapy, and cell and protein biophysics and structural biology (although it is lacking in protein NMR). Stanford is also an incredible institution if you\u2019re interested in Cardiology",

            "comment": "To start,  you can concentrate in molecular bio or bio chem/ biophysics in the bio major at Stanford!\n\n- as the other comment said, A+ are hard to get in stem and if you want them, you\u2019ll probably have to aim at a course notorious for giving them out\n- duck culture is real but I think it comes to knowing yourself and realizing that you will not be \u201cthe best\u201d at everything anymore or struggling with something for the first time; in my opinion it starts to wear off especially after first quarter but there are people who always brag about things being so easy when it\u2019s not\n- flake culture is unfortunately true and real - most of the times plans happen when they\u2019re impromptu not planned\n- I\u2019m not too sure on which classes are harder in comparison to other schools; ik some engineering classes curve down but chem is notorious for being a weed out class and imo physics 40 series structure (although pass fail) isn\u2019t great either \n- the any major to CS pipeline is real but I think it\u2019s mostly when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing and want to default; CS is very straight forward and although it\u2019s not really a walk in the park, so many people are there it makes things better; however, imo a lot of people combine things with cs like symsys \n- quarter system is a toss up; it\u2019s nice going on breaks besides thanksgiving and knowing that you start a new quarter instead of still being in the same class. it\u2019s also great knowing that a hard class is only 10 weeks. However, falling behind really varies from class to class. Sometimes it means missing lectures but if you\u2019re good at a subject, it\u2019s not too bad to catch up. But, usually it\u2019s needing to do assignments and having things pile up with a deadline.  Most people just end up doing worse. But then again, time management is important and will create a diff experience overall",

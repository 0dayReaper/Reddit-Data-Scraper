I went to Vaden today to get some medical help, but it seems like the doctors there are very reluctant with prescribing students sleeping pills?? I got some medication to treat my anxiety but it has almost no use at all.\n\nCan anyone suggest resources at Stanford / nearby that can help? I want to get some sleeping pill prescription to treat my situation. I am so helpless now.",

NFW. \n\nYou need to examine the cause of the problem and not just pop a pill because you cannot deal with the stress. Focus on yourself with exercise, meditation, yoga, and healthy eating. \n\nThere\u2019s OTC melatonin, valerian root, and diphenhydramine (aka Benadryl). Do be careful with long-term use of diphenhydramine, I took it for 3 months and experienced significant chest pains and even went to my PCP who ran an EKG on me. We pinpointed my sleep aid as the source of my pain.",

            "comment": "I suffered from extremely bad insomnia several years ago and advise against sleeping pills unless you have been with a sleep therapist for a while. Much of the time the side effects of the sleeping medication are worse than the insomnia itself. It took me several months of changing my habits to overcome my insomnia with a sleep therapist but it was worth it. I was treated elsewhere so I don't know anyone here to recommend, but I suggest looking or asking for one if this becomes a long term issue.  \n\nSome general recommendations are to avoid working or doing anything but sleep in your bedroom, don't try to go to bed early - actually stay up until you've been falling asleep the past few nights, get up at a consistent time, and slowly go to bed earlier as you are able to. Also avoid phones right before bed and get a consistent night routine that queues your body that it's time to sleep. I've tried just about every trick in the book if you want to pm me. It's stressful to not be able to sleep, but I think setting healthy sleep habits will be much more beneficial for long term than seeking out medication so soon.",

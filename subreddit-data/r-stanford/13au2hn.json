            "comment": "Inspired by the recent post that stole an infographic from u/xcadriller37. People like to doomspeak about \u201ctoo many CS majors\u201d, but the reality is that there have always been dominant majors on campus. A decade ago, Biology+Human Biology majors were by far the largest group on campus, and the relative magnitude of their peak over the past 20 years isn\u2019t that far off from peak Computer Science + Symbolic Systems. \n\n      \n\nWhy does CS stand out so much? The proportion of CS to SymSys is much higher over time than similar proportions in other grouped majors. HumBio vs. Bio is a roughly 60/40 split, while CS vs. SymSys is more like 80/20. If you had a more balanced split for CS (maybe the 60/40 split), the number of degrees would still be high, but perhaps not cause as much hand-wringing.\n\n\n     \n\nI used [degree conferral data from Stanford](https://irds.stanford.edu/data-findings/degrees-conferred), plus 3 pairs of majors where students are often deciding between one or the other major in a pair. Note that students can graduate with more than 1 major, so number of degrees isn\u2019t exactly equal to number of students. Sorry I didn't add the exact numbers/splits to the graph, this was just a quick exercise in Excel.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve always wondered if students with affinity for STEM were mainly deciding between medicine and CS, and their decision depended on the rise and fall of the stock market/economy.  This data seems to confirm my suspicion. When the market is booming, more kids decide to go into CS and join tech companies as an efficient way to earn a 6-figure salary with just an undergrad degree.  When the market is down, the realities of cyclical booms and busts force them to subscribe to the notion of financial stability that comes with a career in medicine.",

            "comment": "Cool dashboard, I was wondering why the proportion dropped for CS+Symsys for 2021-2022 and then I remembered that COVID affected yearly attendance and that the y-axis is counts and not proportions\n\nI always am curious about what major programs were \"affected\" by shifts in growth for CS, i.e. what programs had a decrease in majors across the decades. Just some I see off the bat that had significant reductions between the last two decades (from 2003 to 2022):\n\n* 171 (2003) to a peak of 229 (2009) down to 114 (2022) - HumBio\n* 158 (2003) to a peak of 194 (2005) down to 108 (2022) - Econ\n* 66 (2003) to a peak of 83 (2004) down to a new low 27 (2022) - History\n* 120 (2003) which was a peak year down to 64 (2022), which is a peak for the last decade - International Relations\n\nMeanwhile, a substantial growth as well for disciplines that are either related to or similar to CS in terms of technical depth or as potential gateways to tech: Math, MCS, STS, and SymSys all had stable growth the past twenty years. I found this fascinating given that I was wildly indecisive between MCS and SymSys, and also considered math and CS when I was a freshman almost a decade ago.\n\nThe top ten for the Humanities and Science school also fluctuated a lot: English, History, and American Studies were all the top ten conferred degrees for this school in 2003, and now none of these programs are within the top ten in 2022. (I don't think i've met a single American Studies major at Stanford) What degrees overtook their spots in the top ten? Math, MCS, and STS!",

I'd love if someone has data on hand going back further, because anecdotally the majors you call out are ones that used to be the \"it\" major in previous years. History majors were huge in the 1960s agains the backdrop of the Cold War an the US Civil Rights movement, while Econ easily outclassed every other major through the 1980s (and the lowest it's been since 2003 is 6th place. Way back at Stanford's founding, you studied Geology to get a hot new job with the USGS.",

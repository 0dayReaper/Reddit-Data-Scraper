    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm broadly interested in mathematical optimization (though other stuff like reinforcement learning or high-dimensional probability interests me as well) and am trying to decide which program to apply to. My background in undergrad was mathematics, so I'm more so drawn to the theory side of things than applications.\n\nI've already looked into the Mathematics and ICME programs, and based on what the qualifying exams for each of these programs focus on, I don't think these would be a good fit for me or be the most relevant preparation for what I what to conduct research in. (I'm not sure that the algebra and/or topology exams that I could choose for quals are all that pertinent to future research, and I'm not super eager to have to study diff eq's for quals for either of them.)Similarly, I think I've ruled out CS since I'm not particularly enthusiastic about systems/hardware, as well as \"Operations, Information &amp; Technology\" program, which has more of an economics bent.\n\nThe main 2 programs I'm deciding between are:\n\n* Operations Research (Department of Management Science and Engineering)\n   * Fairly light course requirements?  \n(*Edit*: also need to take into account the candidacy form) \n   * quals seem to be grade &amp; paper based, as opposed to exams  \n(*Edit:* there's an oral/written exam or paper/defnese component as well for the area qualification)\n* EE department\n   * based on the graduate handbook and dept. website, course requirements &amp; quals are flexible/individualized\n   * students are responsible for taking the initiative to find faculty and come to an agreement with them on curriculum, content of qual oral exams\n\nFor anyone who's been in either of these programs, is there anything that I should know about either of them? e.g. which department might have more resources/funding or easier to navigate \"department politics\", etc. I'd also be happy to listen to other advice you might have.\n\nI know I can only apply to one grad program per academic year, so I want to make sure I'm making an informed decision.\n\nJust to be clear, I'm not asking anyone to \"chance me\" or review my application, so hopefully I'm not breaking any subreddit rules.",

                    "comment": "I mean I certainly agree, but the MS&amp;E program does state that you can work with faculty advisors outside of the department, so long as at least one of them is an MS&amp;E faculty member. And from the EE graduate handbook:\n\n&gt;Most students find an advisor from among the primary faculty members of the Department. The research advisor may alternatively be a faculty member from another Stanford department who is familiar with supervising doctoral students and able to provide both advising and funding for the duration of the doctoral program.\n\nSo for either program, there are probably less hurdles to working with faculty in your home department, but you can still work with faculty outside your department (whose willingness I'd imagine would largely come down to whether you have an appropriate background and overlap in research interests, plus how much they prioritize students in their home department).\n\nIf it helps, some faculty from the MS&amp;E department whose research I'm interested in are Madeleine Udell, Benjamin Van Roy (both MS&amp;E and EE), Vasilis Syrgkanis, Ellen Vitercik, and Yinyu Ye.\n\nSome faculty from the EE department whose research interests me are Sanjay Lall, Stephan Boyd, John C. Duchi, and Mert Pilanci.\n\nDo you have any experience with any of these faculty?\n\nObviously yes, the next step might be to email current/past students and ask them what their experiences were like, but I think it might help to first narrow down which department to focus on before doing any of that.",

I'm not trying to get off easy, nor am I going out of way to deliberately pick a program with as difficult a curriculum as possible.\n\nI was talking to a post-doc at my university who did the ACO program at Georgia Tech for graduate school, and he mentioned that while he did have a good advisor whose research he liked and who he got along with, he commented that a lot of the coursework he took ended up not being very relevant to his research.",

Is Stanford strict or light when it comes to tackling COVID and/or social distancing? \n\nBackground: Group of students went to Utah to rent out a house so they can host large parties. To be fair, I did not verify myself if they are all stanford students, but one of the students is even a decently-sized youtuber.\n\n\nDisclaimer: Not a Stanford student (just saw this on UCLA Secrets)",

I see people flying and going to other countries and that\u2019s already a mark of privilege\u2014 but straight up hosting huge parties is another level of disregard. They are a part of the problem that is making the pandemic worse. They need a check up to know what the hell they are doing. I struggle with high loads of remote work and I work at W-lm-rt (the only job besides McDonald\u2019s I was able to get in this economy) where I HAVE TO interact with tons of people for my duties to save up and help pay for college. I make right above min wage and I can\u2019t imagine what they are paying for the mansion. There are so many Stanford students in my position or worse financial states with Immunocompromised families that would wish to have an iota of the privilege and wealth they flaunt on social media. I simply find their actions completely abhorrent.",

They've hung out consistently with students from Columbia and MIT, including one case in which they were partying at another location that was not their house. It's unknown if those people were all following coronavirus-related protocols or not. I agree, a vast majority of students (although many are not vocal about this at all) really are sick of the flaunting that's going on social media - it's like a big \"fuck you\" to those who aren't able to afford to rent a house or are choosing not to do so due to public health restrictions.\n\nJust a fun fact on the side, I think what they were doing might have been illegal. Airbnb earlier in the summer instituted a global party ban on all of its properties worldwide. Additionally, strict occupancy limits were set on all properties too, in order to discourage people renting houses to serve as party locations. Had they been caught partying (and if that was reported to Airbnb), they would not have gotten away as easily as they did this time.",

They had parties with themselves and members of the Stanford track team that was living nearby and was getting tested regularly. Not like they opened their doors to the wider community. I don't know why they posted their parties on social media, that was dumb, but in the pictures, there literally are never more than 10-12 people there.",

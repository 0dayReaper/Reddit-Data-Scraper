    "postText": "I'm a current sophomore majoring in CS on the AI track and after the end of this spring, I will have finished the CS core and taken CS221, CS231N, and CS224N. After having taken these classes and Math 104, I was thinking that pursuing a coterm in Statistics for a 5th year would be really fun and provide me a more rigorous approach to the building blocks of ML.\n\nHowever, I haven't taken any Stats dept classes and the only relevant experience I have is CS109 and Math 104. I also have a 3.8 gpa and a slightly lower one for CS/math classes\n\n1. What classes should I take to prepare for the applying for the program because I know I need at least two 200+ level stats classes to be eligible. Should I take Math 52 and 53?\n2. How hard is getting into the program in general (especially compared to CS)\n3. Do you think it would be worth it to just do an coterm in CS instead and do the AI track again?\n\nI'm pretty conflicted right now so literally any advice or insights would be amazing \u2014\u00a0thanks!",

I try pretty hard to have a good work-life balance and have only taken over 16 units in a quarter once whilst here. \n\nI just really love my coursework and everything I'm learning, so I just want to make sure I can plan out my time here so I can keep pursuing the stuff I find most interesting! I am going to be having fun and making memories regardless.",

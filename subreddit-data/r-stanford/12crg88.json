    "postText": "Normally I wouldn't post something so specific to r/Stanford but there's a looming deadline on Friday, so I feel pressed to propagate this info more actively than I would otherwise.\n\n2 SAIL CS PhD students in Professor Koyejo's lab are seeking to recruit PURE (&amp; CURIS) students for AI research projects on topics related to language models, interactive theorem proving and transformer compression.  Possible projects include:\n\n* Expert Iteration for Language Model Sampling\n* Pretraining Language Models from Human Preferences\n* Large Language Models' Capabilities in One-Shot Mathematical Proof Generation with In-Context Learning\n* Parameter Sharing in Transformers\n\nThe  PURE deadline is this Friday, so if you are a PURE student and  interested, please reach out ASAP. We will be happy to work with you to  meet the deadline.If interested, please contact Rylan Schaeffer ([rschaef@stanford.edu](mailto:rschaef@stanford.edu)) or Brando Miranda ([brando9@stanford.edu](mailto:brando9@stanford.edu)).",

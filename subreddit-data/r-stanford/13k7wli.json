    "postText": "Hi! I am class of 2027 and I was just wondering- how hard is it to make friends at Stanford? I really love Stanford but I am just worried that the size of the campus will feel isolating/make it hard to find close friends. \n\nI am currently debating between Stanford and Yale and just hope to make a handful of nice friends in college. I would love to hear if it is difficult to making friends or if there are a lot of systems in place to help one do so. Thank you! :)",

There are tons of cool clubs to choose from, &amp; there's good Greek life if you want that sort of thing. But wasn't the decision deadline almost three weeks ago? From your post history it seems you were still trying to make the Stanford-Yale choice back then.",

I just went out to NYC for a visit earlier this year and had dinner with half a dozen of my SLE freshmen (now all in their 50s). Still got along great and had a wonderful dinner and too many drinks afterward at a bar. \ud83d\ude01\n\nI also recently had friends from my freshman dorm (Donner) over for a long afternoon. Three decades later, we still really enjoy getting to see each other.",

People are generally open to making new friends, and there are plenty of opportunities to meet people.

I\u2019d also note that even though there are a lot of undergrads, the community is still relatively tight-knit, and it\u2019s genuinely challenging to meet someone with whom you don\u2019t have mutual friends or contacts.",

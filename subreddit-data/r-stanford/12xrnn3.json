I'm interested to calculate how much the fees are for the MSC Computer Science program online [https://online.stanford.edu/programs/computer-science-ms-degree](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/computer-science-ms-degree)\n\nIt says on the site that you need 45 units to get the degree, and each unit is $1,400. Does the degree really cost $63,000?",

You won't be spending any money for room and board or tickets. Also, I'm guessing it won't be that hard to be accepted?",

            "comment": "Stanford students make fun of STS for being an easy/athlete major\u2014and it is\u2014but honestly it\u2019s a very cool subject in itself. A lot of the professors affiliated with STS do super interesting work. The core classes fill up quick. Personally I think Stanford should make STS (and other neat majors like communications) more rigorous; making a major too easy dissuades smart students who would otherwise be interested from enrolling.",

Most folks see the humanities as easier than STEM, but imo that\u2019s only true because grading is more lenient, not because the content is inherently simpler. Some leniency is expected to compensate for greater subjectivity when it comes to grading say papers, but I think graders pull their punches too much now.\n\nI\u2019m sure there are many classes that could also have more rigorous content (eg harder, more thought-provoking readings), but my greater objection is to how light grading can be.",

I was given the freedom to explore two cores that I had a lot of interest in (ME/PD/CS) while also taking lots of great humanities class that enriched my core classes. I\u2019m graduating with a degree in Innovation and Organization, which will allow me to take a bunch of different routes when it comes to job. I could pick up UX/UI or SWE or Product Design. It has given me the freedom to explore while completing my degree. I recommend it if you are really interested in how the humanities and STEM interact with each other and what that means in real life.",

I've honestly found some of the STS classes hard despite the reputation of them being easy because it's often subjective grading by TAs that can be harsh and unclear",

            "comment": "In response to criticism that STS is an \"easy\" major: I did a legitimately hard major (chemistry), but if you're interested in STS I think there's a lot of value in doing it. I can see a few good exit options. First, if you do really high-quality research and writing, you could probably find a PhD program. You'll probably stand out more in the program, which could help you vault to the top of an applicant pool when you might face more challenges in other majors. Second, you can always apply to law school if you're interested in law and policy. Even the best law schools really only care about two things: GPA and LSAT. You can get a very good GPA in STS. Third, you could pursue a job in public policy. If you doing some summer internships in DC (lobbying firm, association, or on the Hill) you might be able to land a good gig for after Stanford, and then you could apply to public policy grad programs or law school later. The latter would require taking some time to build a network, but it's really not *that* hard to pull off. \n\nAt the risk of offending current students, being 16 years out I can say that recent graduates largely aren't ready to take on a lot of responsibility at work yet. Your job is to signal your interest and potential to employers in order to reach that first rung on the ladder. If you can find a great employer, they'll mentor you and build up your skills. The best work is a continuation of your education. I'm quite confident that you can use the STS program to find a great employer.",

    "postText": "So I have the absolute privilege of getting into Princeton, Stanford, Duke and Johns Hopkins in the past 24 hours. I\u2019m now deciding between Princeton and Stanford and I\u2019m torn.\n\nBasic info: cost is bascially the same because of scholarships. I\u2019m from the UK so east coast is cheaper to fly. \n\nCAREER/ACADEMICS: I applied as a polticial science/public policy/econ major. I hope to go into work related to economics, finance or public policy kind of stuff. I\u2019ve heard east coast is the best for this, especially Princeton because it\u2019s close to NY and relatively close to DC (compared to Stanford lol). I haven\u2019t yet done my similar level of research on Stanford but Princeton\u2019s SPIA (School of Public and International Affairs) is one of the best if not the best in the world, which seems very exciting. I\u2019m also interested in the intersection of public policy and AI which Princeton is doing research on that I\u2019m intrigued by.\n\n*So career and academic wise it seems to currently makes better sense to go to Princeton \u2014 Although both schools have fantastic international reputations*\n\nStudent life:\n\nI\u2019ve spent so much time watching Stanford vlogs \u2014 the life there and the campus seems like heaven. Of course Stanford isn\u2019t without its flaws (Stanford bubble) but it does seem incredible + I\u2019d love to cycle/electric skateboard to class! Stanford new neighbourhood system seems cool as well though I don\u2019t know enough about it to comment. \n\nPrinceton, I know everything abt this school from Justin and Nicholas Chae vlogs. Princeton campus is EPIC for its old school architecture. I also really like the residential college system for the first 2 years. Potential negatives are the tough academics (apparently there\u2019s grade deflation???) and the fact that the fencing team are way beyond my level. I could potential join Princeton as a walk on athlete but still unlikely. Whereas with Stanford (also Division 1), I\u2019d have a bit better chance of getting on the team. I\u2019m a fencer for my national team btw but Americans are insane at fencing.\n\n\nMajor questions and final remarks:\n\nFor my academics and career path, am I correct in thinking Princeton is better? \n\nUsing your anecdotes, how would you compare the student life of either school?\n\nMy mom says that since Princeton doesn\u2019t have a business or law school that I should go to Princeton because I won\u2019t get the chance to go there otherwise. Whereas she says that Stanford will always be there for MBA/law. Basically if I want both schools I should go to Princeton for college and possibly Stanford after. \n\nPlease could any of y\u2019all help me decide (especially those ppl who have gone/ are at either school though all help is still appreciated)?!!",

Admin\u2019s crackdown on social life has been terrible, and the Stanford bubble/surrounding suburbs are awful if you like the city\u2014and fine if you don\u2019t.\n\nTake all my opinions with a grain of salt: the grass is not always greener, and I have no idea what Princeton is like. Others will have differing opinions that you should take just as seriously. I don\u2019t regret coming to Stanford: career-wise and academically it\u2019s been everything I could ask for (as someone in both STEM and the social sciences), and I\u2019ve met great friends.

At Stanford, if you study anything non-tech related you might feel a bit left out because a crazy amount of students are all in CS or CS-related majors, and most of the job opportunities are in tech (due to location in Silicon Valley). \n\nAlso Stanford is quite isolated unless you own a car and are willing to drive to do things (e.g. around 1 hour to San Francisco by car, longer if by train, but the Caltrain is kinda bad). For reference, it takes 30 minutes to walk from the central campus to downtown Palo Alto/caltrain station. So most students end up spending a lot of time on campus, hence feeling like a bubble. \n\nAbout the Stanford vlogs, with life/campus there seeming like heaven\u2026 I think many Stanford students struggle with mental health. In my four years there I heard of several suicides. A few students take an extra year to complete their degree, or take time off/leave of absence. It felt like everyone had to pretend everything is good and happy on the outside but on the inside everyone is struggling badly. When I was on the East coast I found people tend to be more vocal about their struggles and commiserate together through the dark winter months, and I think that might be healthier, than the way Stanford is where you\u2019re expected to feel happy all the time.\n\nAlso didn\u2019t enjoy the residential system at Stanford, I lived in a different dorm every year, and some dorms are pretty old and ugly. \n\nThere were many positive things about my experience too (e.g. supportive academic environment, studying abroad, diversity of student body, laid back culture, access to tech industry opportunities), but just wanted to highlight some of the biggest negatives for you to consider.",

Stanford also has law and business schools, with classes that would def benefit a social science major, while Princeton does not.

I think Stanford is great, but it greatly depends on what you prefer and what you want for your future.   \n\n\nThese comments are based on my personal experience here, and I know is very different from the experience that other people have had.  \n\n\n**Academics:** \n\n \\- Are you an Economics incoming student? If not, I wouldn't say Econ professors, or the Econ profession is very open to work with other disciplines, that includes PoliSci, although their political economy people seem very collaborative and nice overall. Stanford does not have a proper Public Policy department compared to UChicago Harris, HKS or Princeton SPIA. Thus, the overlap surface that you will have with faculty is very limited. \n\n\\- Classes are sometimes restricted to graduate students in their area, and the gatekeepers are not very nice. I had a bad experience trying to take Econ 2nd year courses, even with the necessary background (I took all the micro sequence). PoliSci is starting a similar trend, again being political economy an exception to this. \n\n\\- I've taken amazing classes in Engineering and CS. This is probably the main difference with Princeton, although their CS department is also very top notch! I think Stanford is a collaborative place, but the social sciences tend to be clique and weird sometimes. \n\n\\- I don't do PoliSci, but took their quant coursework and it was amazing. Faculty is very supporting, and they're nice. I have heard similar things about Princeton. My best friends in campus come from that department. \n\n**Social Life**\n\nThis is my main sore point. Life in Palo Alto/Stanford sucks! I come from a city and I thought I would like the outdoors life, but in California outdoors are only for the people with cars. SF Bay Area has no functional train, no bus system, and Stanford does not provide bus passes (something other campuses in the area do). I have had very sad days in this campus, but I have also met amazing souls and very kind humans. \n\nI have struggled to have a community, and is hard to be out of the gradschool bubble because chances are the people you will meet in regular life are Stanford affiliated or Bay Area tech workers. That's not bad on itself, but again, if you come from a city, people tend to be more diverse than that.  Let me know if you have more questions :)   \n\n\nI hope you make the decision that makes you happy and whatever you think is better for you, don't think of ranking or status.",

Whereas she says that Stanford will always be there for MBA/law.\n\n\nThere are many good business schools and law schools for a graduate of either Stanford or Princeton, and being a student in law school or business school is a very different experience from being an undergraduate: going to Stanford as a law student is *not* going to give you the experience of being an undergraduate all over again.  So your mother's advice, while well-intentioned, should be ignored. Do not turn down a school's offer because it has another program that you haven't been admitted to yet.",

Clubs can get absolutely insane amounts of funding (one of the theater groups, I shit you not, has their own endowment), research is well-funded enough that it\u2019s not too hard to get an RA position if that\u2019s your thing, and there are just so, so many types of grants to pay for even the dumbest of shit. I got $1500 for an art project that I didn\u2019t even finish. Aside from that, there are a lot of internships that are offered exclusively to Stanford students in a variety of industries, so you\u2019ll get some great work experience.\n\nCons: the neighborhood system is fucking stupid.",

If that's the case, and if cost really isn't a factor, I think Stanford is the obvious choice. While Berkeley is great at the graduate level, at the undergraduate level Stanford is just in a completely different league w/ regard to prestige/opportunities/funding/etc.\n\nIn terms of best/worst things about Stanford: some of the best things are, as others have mentioned, the weather, the people, and the amazing opportunities you'll get here. I can't really think of too many bad things, although I can say that the administration has gotten quite heavy-handed of late.",

Some students excel and stand out far easier than others - they would succeed in other schools, regardless of the support systems in place. \n\nPeople can critique the neighborhood system, the suburban setting, the heavy emphasis on graduate research, but none of those things are really faults.\n\nTo be fair, I did *very* poorly academically during my undergrad at Stanford, and was placed on academic probation after my 1st quarter. Resources were in place, but I was overwhelmed from day 1 and I had a lot of growing up to do. I was a late bloomer and didn\u2019t really succeed until I was in my 30s.",

I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t have to be talented to get hired if you go to Stanford, but I come from enterprise software sales in Silicon Valley with a history of working in recruiting - that name alone creates an insanely high perceived value of intelligence and therefore trust in your ability to be a qualified hire at a company. That\u2019s a life changing acceptance letter that can create generation wealth\u2026 that being said, I work harder than my friend who went to Yale (I went to ASU) and make more than him, but that\u2019s because tech sales is one quick path to your first million which is why I dedicated many years to this career.",

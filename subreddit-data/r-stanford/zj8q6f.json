    "postText": "Hi from across the pond (UK)\n\nBackground: I am on the path to changing my career path and retraining towards this - part of this change has involved some online learning and one is a short course (8 weeks) accredited by Stanford. On my finishing of this course i will receive a certificate of completion from Stanford university which i can put into my LinkedIn profile under th certs and licenses section;\n\nQuestion: Would it be 'frowned' upon by those Stanford alumni (who studied there for 'years') if i was to add Stanford in my LinkedIn Education - after doing a '8 week' online short course? I would love to to this but thought is this a bit of a \"faux pas\" thing to do?\n\nThanks for your help",

At best, it looks unprofessional, and people know the difference. Respect the Stanford alumni who put in the work for their degree, and place this course in the \u201ccertification\u201d section where it belongs.",

The problem is selling a certificate as a degree in my opinion. If it comes from a famous school it makes the whole thing even more pretentious",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! I was recently admitted as a transfer student and I am so excited! I honestly was not expecting it at all so this caught me completely by surprise. I am currently a psychology major and I would like to go into policy reform for corrections. I am transferring from a cc in Miami and have never been to Cali. \n\nI wanted to ask what advice you could give me for the transition and what the best ways to get involved would be. I know it\u2019s a broad question but anything helps!",

Based on my experience, I think it'd be a great way to meet people and begin your landing / transition to Stanford.\n\n[https://rec.stanford.edu/adventure/stanford-pre-orientation-trips-spot](https://rec.stanford.edu/adventure/stanford-pre-orientation-trips-spot)\n\nCongratulations, and welcome :)",

Even if you only meet with the mentor once or twice it can be super helpful for hearing about opportunities in areas you are interested in. I've found that a lot of opportunities are hard to find by searching and can only really be found by word of mouth so talking to people in this format can be really helpful for that.",

Hope you spend some wonderful 4 years there :)  \n\n\nI applied as an international transfer student from Greece, but unfortunately wasn't lucky enough this time :(\n\n  \nI would love to discuss with you, if you don't have an issue with that, how you approached the application process, and learn more about how you presented your competitive personal advantage, in order to make myself a better candidate the next time!  \n\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!",

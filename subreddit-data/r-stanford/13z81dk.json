    "postText": "Hi! \n\nI am intending to major in CS with an AI track. However, I have no particular experience in programming and I haven\u2019t studied Calculus in A-levels. \n\nThough I am planning to learn mathematics online over the summer and take placement tests to start with the later courses, I am still not sure if I\u2019ll able to complete my undergraduate credit requirement in 4 years without taking a summer. \n\nIf I start with the very introductory level courses in Maths and CS, do you think it\u2019ll be harder for me to complete the credit requirements or get internships down the lane? \n\nAlso, I would love if someone can advice me on how to prepare myself in the summer before college starts?",

Majors are designed to be completed in 2.\n\n&gt; if I start with the very introductory courses\u2026will it be harder to compete the credits requirements\n\nNo, as said above majors are designed to be completed in 2 years. Won\u2019t make getting internships much harder. The only thing that is affected is your ability to start doing research - for the vast majority of interested students, they don\u2019t launch their research careers optimally anyway, so you\u2019re honestly not missing out on much.\n\n&gt; Advice\n\nJust enjoy yourself, listen to some podcasts, travel the world, make some memories. It\u2019ll be one of your last free summers in a long time",

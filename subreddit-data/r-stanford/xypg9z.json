I sometimes get urges to dance at night and wanted to know if there are spaces I could use to maybe put on headphones and dance without worrying about disturbing my dorm room neighbors. Preferably with mirrors, but I\u2019ll take anything I can get.\n\nThanks for any suggestions!",

You can find the schedule online to see when it\u2019s free. I can\u2019t remember when exactly it closes but I\u2019ve been there at 10 or so at night before.",

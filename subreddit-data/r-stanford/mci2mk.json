    "postText": "I have noticed a couple of posts here and on SMC about taxes on financial aid. It's evident to me that many students are struggling with this and Stanford will provide you with little information to aid the process. This tax-law was updated quite a bit in 2018 so many of the resources you find online will be outdated. I am not a tax professional and this is not tax advice, but I'm a low-income student who despises paying taxes on my higher education Financial Aid.\n\n**Learn more directly from the IRS with 2020** [**Publication 970.**](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf)\n\n^(\\*Tax information for international students is a different process that is much more student-specific.)\n\n**1098-T**: This is an [IRS form](https://sfs.stanford.edu/taxes/resources) that you will find on Axess that tells you how much money Stanford gave you (Box 5)  and how much of that money went towards qualified expenses (Box 1) only in that tax year. You might see numbers in Box 4 and Box 6 because you went on an LOA or Stanford made adjustments. In this case, you will need to request an \"Itemized 1098-T\" from Student Services and you might need to amend a previous tax year.\n\nMy Axess --&gt; Taxes --&gt; View/Grant 1098-T or request one via Student Services Help Ticket.\n\n**Qualified Tuition Related Expense** [(QTRE)](https://sfs.stanford.edu/taxes/us-citizen-and-resident-alien-students): Qualified expenses are NOT taxable income.\n\n* Tuition\n* Required Fees (Doc Fee, Student Activities Fee, Student Health Fee)\\*\n* Course Fees for degree-related classes (Chem Lab Fee via ePay Check Payment)\n* Athletic Scholarships, to some extent, [see Pub. 970](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf)\n* Insurance Scholarships\\*\\*\n\n**What does not qualify?**\n\n* Housing, House Dues, Technology Fee\\*\\*\\*\n* Meal Plan\\*\\*\\*\n* Refunds\n* Insurance Scholarships\\*\\*\n* Personal expenses, travel, moving costs, etc.\n\n^(\\*The Student Activities Fee and Document Fee is likely already assessed as part of Box 1. The Health Services Fee is not included in Box 1 so it must be manually calculated when you file. Use the itemized 1098-T from student services for your specific calculation.)\n\n^(\\*\\* If Stanford provides you a scholarship for Cardinal Care, this amount will not be calculated into Box 1 automatically as a QTRE. However, this is required for all students to attend and can be manually calculated as a QTRE when filing your taxes. Insurance Premiums do NOT count as a QTRE for the purpose of Education credits and deductions (i.e. AOTC or LLC)) ^(even if paid out of pocket.)\n\n^(\\*\\*\\* Even though undergraduates are required to have a meal plan and 97% of students live on campus, you can technically still choose to live off-campus and not purchase a meal plan. Since most colleges don't have such requirements, it is not acceptable for one student to deduct room and board at Stanford, when a student who chose to attend a community college cannot deduct their rent and groceries. There is no exception to this IRS rule--room and board is not a QTRE in any situation.  House dues and the tech fee are not assessed to every student, only those who 'chose' to live on campus so they can not be counted as QTRE.)\n\n**Unearned Income:** Income you have received that was not in exchange for services such as your financial aid scholarships. This is subject to [Kiddie Tax](https://www.thetaxadviser.com/issues/2016/apr/kiddie-tax-may-be-due-on-college-scholarships.html) for minors and dependents, however, because CA is a [non-conformity state](https://www.taxcpe.com/blogs/news/kiddie-tax-non-conformity), Unearned Income Tax is assessed for Full-Time students under the age of 24. When you file, you will pay both Federal Income Tax and State Income Tax subject to unearned income tax. Kiddie Tax was created to prevent parents from sheltering money from the IRS in their children, but accidentally had a huge negative impact on low-income families. If someone claims you as a dependent, your non-QTRE scholarship will likely be subject to Kiddie Tax.\n\n**A side note on Stipends, Grants, and Fellowships:**\n\nFellowships, grants, and other stipends are not already taxed when you receive them--Stanford will not withhold taxes for you. These will look like lump-sum payments on your Axess billing, as opposed to hourly wages. If this funding was used for non-QTRE, it must be reported as taxable income (See Form 1040 and 1098-T). A wage or payroll job (RA, TA, etc.) will be taxed through a W-2 that you can find on Axess--this is a different type of income compared to a scholarship or fellowship.\n\nUndergrads-- If you worked a summer research job, internship, or whatever and they provided a 'stipend' for anything (housing, funding, cardinal quarter, Frosh101, etc.), this is income you need to report to the IRS unless they specifically gave a tax-form for this stipend (and I doubt they will). Stanford will not pay these taxes on your behalf-- it might already be reported on your 1098-T so ask for an itemized report!\n\n**Education Credits**: The IRS will grant you credits or deductions when you pay out-of-pocket expenses on QTRE. There is the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) and the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC). Both have restrictions on income limits (MAGI). You cannot claim double benefits in the same year!\n\nEligibility requirements for [AOTC versus LLC](https://www.eitc.irs.gov/other-refundable-credits-toolkit/compare-education-credits/compare-education-credits)\n\n*In the case of an audit, which is not uncommon for claiming credits, you must be able to provide definitive proof of your claims.*\n\n^(Proof? You'll need all or a combination of the below:)\n\n* ^(Receipts or other evidence showing you paid out-of-pocket for the expense (Stanford ePay))\n* ^(Stanford requires all students to pay this) [^(expense)](https://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/tuitionfeesandhousing/#mealplanstext) ^(to enroll and attend)\n* ^(Your Prof. and syllabus require this expense in order to enroll and attend the class)\n* ^(The expense has no reasonable alternative (Free Version, Computer Cluster, School Library, etc.))\n\n**AOTC:** Half-time or Full-time Stanford Undergrads seeking a degree are eligible  The amount of the credit is 100 percent of the first $2,000 of qualified education expenses you paid for each eligible student and 25 percent of the next $2,000 of qualified education expenses you paid for that student.\u00a0 If you are on full financial aid at Stanford, you will likely only be able to claim very little from the AOTC because our only genuine out-of-pocket QTRE are course fees for major requirement classes like CHEM31.\n\n**What can I claim?**\n\n* Out of pocket QTRE (not scholarship $$)\n* Mandatory degree-related course fees (e.g. Chem Lab Fee)\n* Mandatory degree-related supplies (e.g. Stanford Lab Coat)\n* Computer Programs explicitly required by a Prof. not free on cluster computers (Octave v. Matlab)\n* Required single-use access codes (e.g. Mastering Physics)\n* Books required by a course to enroll\n\n**What can I NOT claim?**\n\n* A laptop or iPad\\*\n* Books that are only recommended by a Prof.\n* Books that are readily available and free for check-out at Stanford Library\n* Study aids like note-taking apps or Chegg (sadly)\n* School Supplies (backpack, pencils, etc. unless explicitly required for a required class like ART)\n\n^(\\*Even though it is basically essential to have a laptop at Stanford, you cannot actually claim this expense because the school offers free access to 24/7 computer clusters and check-out laptops. Stanford explicitly states that students are NOT required to own a personal computer to enroll and attend any of the) *^(Undergraduate)* ^(Degree programs (certain Graduate programs follow different rules) This) [^(court case example)](https://www.currentfederaltaxdevelopments.com/blog/2016/8/25/purchase-of-computer-from-local-retailer-did-not-qualify-for-american-opportunity-tax-credit) ^(from Berkeley.)\n\n**LLC:**  Mostly used by &lt; full-time students and graduate students. The amount of the credit is 20 percent of the first $10,000 of qualified education expenses or a maximum of $2,000 per return. The LLC is not refundable. So, you can use the credit to pay any tax you owe but you won\u2019t receive any of the credit back as a refund.\n\nWhat can I claim?\n\n* Tuition, fees, and supplies required to purchase (out-of-pocket) *directly from the school*, so long as it's a condition of enrollment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ok, I'm ready to file!**\n\n1. Download your **1098-T** from Axess or request a copy from student services. Give this 1098-T to your accountant, parents, personal records, or whoever files your taxes.\n2. If your Box 5 is LARGER than your Box 1, request an \"**Itemized 1098-T**\" from Stanford Student Services for that tax-year. This will explain exactly how each box has been calculated and is essential for accurately filing.\n3. Determine your calculated **QTRE** (Box 1 + Required Fees Stanford didn't report)\n4. Calculate your total **taxable unearned income** from scholarships (Box 5 - Calculated QTRE)\n5. Determine if you're eligible for any education credits (**AOTC or LLC**)\n6. Provide this information to your account, parents, or online filing systems (I use [freetaxusa.com](https://freetaxusa.com))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What exactly will I owe?**\n\nIf you determine that your total amount of scholarship is greater than your QTRE, you will have taxable unearned income to report to the IRS. This will incur both federal income taxes and possibly unearned income taxes  (if you're under 24). Your total taxable scholarship + your normal income from the year determines the rate at which you are taxed. If you are on full financial aid and did not withhold taxes from your job or internship, your tax burden is going to be high (like as much as $2000+ for one year).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFAQ:\n\n**Does the IRS know how much Stanford gave me?**\n\n* Yes, the 1098-T form is submitted to IRS on your behalf from Stanford just like a W-2.\n\n**Who needs to file a return?**\n\n* Anyone who receives a 1098-T, especially students who receive a room and board scholarship.  Room and board alone &gt;&gt; Standard deduction, you are required to file. *Just because you have a taxable scholarship, does not necessarily mean you will owe any money.*\n\n**I didn't pay taxes a previous year (or my parents didn't).**\n\n* Unfortunately, you'll need to amend your taxes to make corrections. Underreported income and tax evasion is a common and serious offense that can incur penalties, fines, and even charges (even if you were genuinely unaware). Amending your taxes is your best opportunity to pay the least without facing the scrutiny of the IRS--it's not hard if you use an online service either. Taxes have a statute of up to three years; many audits for education will occur in the later half of the statute--just because you got away with it this year does not mean you're safe. Serious offenses can go back even more years.\n\n**I claimed credits that I was not eligible for.**\n\n* You'll need to pay these back and amend. Claiming education credits that don't align with your 1098-T make you more likely to be flagged by the IRS  for a second-look or audit. Proving you can claim credits can be very difficult during an audit.\n\n**This sucks...I can't afford these taxes...what can I do?**\n\n* Stanford does not consider tax burden as part of an undergraduate student's academic year expenses or student responsibility, despite the fact that taxes might be your largest expense of the school year. Reach out to financial aid and tell them what burden taxes have on you or your family as a direct result of your \"no strings attached\" financial aid package. **Taxes should not be a barrier to undergraduate education at a school like Stanford, especially when it impacts the lowest-income students the most.** At the very least, they can make a better effort to educate students on their potential tax burden. At the most, they can withhold taxes on our behalf or include them in our scholarship.\n* Withhold estimated taxes quarterly, like a savings account.\n\n**What if I don't report my scholarship as income?**\n\n* Some people never get caught for underreporting income or tax evasion. But let's be realistic for a moment...the IRS knows you receive taxable scholarships via 1098-T. It might be statistically unlikely, but if they audit you a couple of years from now, you're going to be facing significant fees and penalties for not paying these taxes. 4 years on full financial aid you never reported? That can be more than $80,000 in unreported income and $10,000 in unpaid federal and state taxes + penalties. This is not something to take lightly as a student or if your parents are responsible.\n\n**My accountant didn't pay for these taxes a previous year.**\n\n* Accountants/CPAs mess up, especially when it comes down to education. If they never received your 1098-T, they couldn't have filed this income in the first place. Even then, without an itemized 1098-T from  Stanford, they likely didn't file correctly. At the end of the day, your tax person is just trying to maximize your refund and would prefer not to explain a 2K tax bill from your financial aid. If they made an error, they will often amend your taxes for you.\n\n**What if my scholarship is a Federal Pell Grant/FAFSA or outside award?**\n\n* The same rules apply. If it used towards QTRE, it is tax-free. If your Pell Grant is used for room and board, for example, it is NOT tax-free. An outside award provider may withhold taxes on your behalf, however, this is rare and should otherwise be treated like all other awards. This applies to money given directly to you or directly to Stanford. If your program gives you money directly, you ~~should~~ are required to report this money to Stanford via Axess.\n\nAs I said, I'm by no means a tax professional, but I think I have a decent grasp on this material. Let me know if I misspoke or left out anything. Just trying to help low-income students navigate this tax-hell.\n\nEdit: Formatting\n\nEdit: Clarification",

Unearned income is NOT subject to FICA taxes (only income taxes) so make sure you file on the correct form so you're not being taxed extra.  1099 is for money in exchange for services and 1040 is more appropriate for unearned income like a fellowship. You also might have CA state income tax FYI.\n\n If you request an itemized 1098-T from student services, it'll tell the billing and distribution dates for every single item that you were refunded or charged, the source of that item (fund, stipend, external, etc.), where that money went (tuition, refund, insurance, fees, etc.), and which box it was calculated into on the 1098-T. It can be very helpful for filing and is way more comprehensive than what's on Axess. Your 1098-T box sums can even be negative numbers, but you won't know unless you receive an itemized version.",

Thank you for bringing this up! \n\nThe same rules for the AOTC/LLC for QTRE.  You or your parents can deduct up to $4,000 in qualified higher education expenses as an above-the-line exclusion from income. This is a deduction though, as opposed to the more desired credit. \n\nYou can also amend previous years to get this deduction, however, you can't claim both the deduction and credits. Like the education credits, this must be an out-of-pocket expense so if you're on high financial aid, consider the AOTC first.",

Can you clarify a bit on Box 4 and Box 6, what kinds of amendments should we make to previous years if we see values in these boxes?\n\nAlso, if I have a research internship that's already reported on my 1098-T, I wouldn't need to also go put it on my 1040 right?",

                    "comment": "Stanford doesn't automatically count cardinal care in the 1098-T because it can't be used for credit or deductions, but insurance is required for students to attend ( for undergrads, idk about grads). It counts as QTRE for your total taxable income, but you can't claim any credits with health insurance premiums. It says this in IRS Pub. 970 and on Stanford's tax info website linked above.\n\nyou can always amend your taxes and get back what you overpaid, it is fairly inexpensive and easy to do so even for multiple years in the past...hope this helps!",

I know non-traditional students 25+ live in grad school housing so it may be a little harder socially.\n\nIs anyone else here an older undergrad student, or do you know anyone else that is? Can you speak to what that experience was like? \n\nThanks for the insight! :)",

He came in the non-traditional route. \n\nAlso lots of other transfer students have similar stories of being a little older.\n\nJoin communities on groupme/discord + find clubs that meet regularly. \n\nHope that helps!",

I'm not very social, so I didn't connect with other transfers on campus as much as I should have. I think if you're willing to be extroverted and put the work into cultivating relationships in the transfer community, you'll be just fine. Also helps your age is really closer and common to most of the transfer students.",

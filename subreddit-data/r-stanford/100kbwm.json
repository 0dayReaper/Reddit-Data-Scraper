Once you are already a section leader, during the spring you can sign up to teach for the summer. You get free undergrad housing for section leading during the summer.\n\nNote that if you apply during spring quarter, you would be completing the mandatory workshops during the fall, so you cannot section lead for the summer. So the latest to apply is winter quarter, and then lead your first section in the spring, if you want to section lead for the summer.",

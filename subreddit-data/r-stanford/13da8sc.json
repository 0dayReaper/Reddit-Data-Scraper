I'm interviewing for a remote position and it already gives a range but I'd like to know a more granular detail about remote work pay for the different areas around the country. \n\nThe regional pay structure is currently behind a Google login page.",

Not sure how that would be helpful as it provides no details on how they're weighted.",

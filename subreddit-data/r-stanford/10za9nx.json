I've heard of people having better chances of success by going to a professor's talk/presentation/office hours to introduce yourself in person and show interest and have a better chance of them noticing you. You could also try emailing grad students or lab managers - oftentimes they will be more responsive than a PI. Another strategy is to take a class with the professor as a way to see them often. Not sure how well these will work since you're just here for the summer but good luck!",

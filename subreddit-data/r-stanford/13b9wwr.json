    "postText": " \n\nHi everyone, my name is Lawrence, and I\u2019m a male-identifying undergraduate at UChicago. I will be interning in the Bay over the summer and am looking for housing near Stanford from June 18-September 7. I am willing to pay around $1500/month and would like roommates. \n\nHere is some information about me. I am interested in machine learning. I am currently doing some research on differential privacy in machine learning, and although that\u2019s unrelated to my summer internship, I would love to discuss machine learning. I also enjoy playing tennis and all sorts of outdoor activities. Indoors, I enjoy playing board games like Dominion. I drink socially. Feel free to check out my website [https://lawrenceztang.com/](https://lawrenceztang.com/). \n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to message me if you are subletting, looking for roommates, or know anyone who is doing either. Hope to hear from you soon!",

    "postText": "I have seen that younger people getting accepted into Stanford have very impressive high school academic resumes and am trying to figure out if I still have a shot at admission comparatively for getting into a undergraduate major (Linguistics, if that impacts decision) despite my early years of slacking off.\n\nUp until my junior year of college, I did not take school very seriously at all, so I did okay but not exceptional. I went to high school in the UK, so I did not graduate with a high school GPA (non-GPA based system), but would say it would\u2019ve probably been the equivalent to about a 3.5/3.6.\n\nI came to the U.S. for college and have gotten my undergraduate degree (Arizona State, Final GPA 3.3, Junior/Senior GPA was 3.8), as well as my Masters degree (Penn State, Final GPA 4.0). \n\nI want to believe that having a graduate degree boosts my chances but I am concerned about my high school and early college years as I can\u2019t go back and change those grades.\n\nDo you think I have any shot at gaining admission to an undergraduate program at Stanford?\n\n\nEdit: It may be worth mentioning I have worked full time for the last 9 years, including during my time in undergrad and grad schools. I work in the Homeland Security field, but am looking to shift trajectories by revisiting school and have always dreamed of Stanford.",

I'm very surprised at this, since it's very uncommon. For example, Stanford doesn't admit for MS degrees to applicants who have already done an MS in the same field at a different institution.\n\nAlso, what is your core motivation for getting another BA? Would you want to \"redo\" undergrad for the undergraduate experience? Or do you think that having a Stanford undergrad will  significantly increase your employment chances?\n\nIn either case, I'm skeptical that you actually need a Stanford undergrad degree. Your 9 years of work experience will be more impressive than 4 more years of college. And the 4-year cost of Stanford undergrad is also extremely expensive (especially the opportunity cost of doing school relative to working and earning a wage), and since you are working fulltime it's unlikely you would be awarded financial aid.\n\nThe non-traditional undergraduate students I've met seem to have different sorts of backgrounds than what you've described. For example:\n\n1. Veterans who served in their country's military after high school\n2. Community college transfers\n3. High school grads who worked/did odd jobs before applying to college much later in life (such as Stanford's own math professor [Persi Diaconis](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Persi_Diaconis))\n\nI believe the above profiles are the more likely ones to be admitted than your situation.",

Requests by such individuals for a second bachelor's degree at Stanford ***are not accepted.***\n\nIn other words, it seems pretty clear that the admissions committee will not admit you if you already have an undergrad degree.\n\nGiven your motivations, I can imagine this will be disappointing to you. However, I think it's probably actually healthier in the long run. I can both empathize with and relate to the psychological place you're starting from (\"*If only I applied myself when I was younger, than I could have achieved X, Y and Z*\"), but I think instead of looking backwards to try and redo college, it would be more productive to look forward and apply that mindset to where you are now.\n\nYou can continue to be motivated and self-driven in your current life and job regardless of where you earned your undergrad (or the grades you received).\n\nLastly, I'm not a therapist or psychologist, but I would encourage you to consider reframing your views on this issue. Rather than viewing your younger, less driven self as a mistake to be erased, you can view it as having given you a perspective and humility that others may not have.\n\nI'm perhaps the same age as you (early 30s) and have met and am friends with very self-driven young people. Some at Stanford, and others elsewhere.\n\nThose who have a more challenging past, with perhaps more downs than ups, often have a more mature and grounded view on life. They often frequently have more empathy towards others, because they know what it's like to have made  large mistakes.\n\nSo perhaps you can view your past with less regret, and instead with more gratitude that you went through a phase and have now emerged on the other side.\n\nJust my 2c.\n\nBest of luck.",

I edited my response just now to have a few final thoughts. \n\nThose thoughts come from the fact that I'm also someone who has also done a number of things I regret when I was  younger that impacted my college admissions (among other things). I didn't apply to Stanford and likely wouldn't have gotten in even if I had applied.\n\nThat being said, I learned quite a lot from my mistakes and still got a lot out of my undergrad.\n\nI'm now doing my MS in CS at Stanford and am actually pretty grateful that I had some earlier challenges.

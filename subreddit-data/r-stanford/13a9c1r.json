    "postText": "Hello everyone, \n\nI'm currently a SWE intern working on ML/AI but looking to get involved in the startup scene here.\n\nI have a lot of free time outside of my internship and want to be part of something more meaningful. I've been actively learning about startups and entrepreneurship. If anyone is looking for a tech co-founder or looking to build a start-up, I'd love to hear from you.\n\nI believe this could be a great opportunity to learn, grow, and make a difference together. If you share this mindset, I'd love to connect and see how we can work together.\n\nThanks for reading!",

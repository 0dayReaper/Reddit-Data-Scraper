    "postText": "Hi! I organize a recurring PhD social for the CS department, and last week we had a great mixer with Applied Physics and Mechanical Engineering, which led us to start thinking about organizing more socials with more departments.\n\nIf you organize a PhD-level departmental social and would be interested in possibly meeting other departments' students, please email me! [rschaef@stanford.edu](mailto:rschaef@stanford.edu)\n\nWe're putting together a spreadsheet with points of contact for each department. I'll send you a link and you can add your contact info if interested!",

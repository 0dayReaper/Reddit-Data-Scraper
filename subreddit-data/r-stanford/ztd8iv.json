            "comment": "Stanford policy permits you to double major and have a minor. However, majors vary wildly in size. Mechanical Engineering is 113 units. Physics is 77 units. A Music minor is 24 units. That's 214 units right there. Plus you have all the various general education requirements (PWR, COLLEGE, Foreign Language, etc.).\n\nKeep in mind that a Bachelor's at Stanford is 180 units. To complete all of what you've proposed, you'll either need a fifth year or have to do the max out of 20 units most quarters (a typical quarter would be 15 units if you graduate at 180).\n\nI did a double major myself at Stanford and considered a minor, but mine were much smaller than what you've proposed. Both my majors were 60 units, so it only took me 120 units to do my double major, leaving me another 60 units to do all my requirements and take some random electives (though most of my electives were just additional courses in my majors since I actually enjoyed them).",

            "comment": "Echoing most of the comments above, yes to, technically, you are allowed to have 2 majors + minor with varying unit requirement (180/225) depending on how you structure them. I just want you to consider the mental stress over having to do THAT many units in at least 4, commonly 5, not uncommonly 6 years. \n\nWhile someone mentioned extracurriculars (you seem interested in music) and downtime (it is natural to want free time, for yourself or for socials), another big component of allotting time at Stanford is for a post-Stanford career. Do you want a job? If so, networking and job search will consume year 3/4. Do you want higher education? If so, applications will consume year 4. Do you want to  take time off after graduation? Fine, then nothing major needs to be considered. \n\nDouble majoring can be a lot of stress because Stanford releases class schedule every year and not 4 years in advance. That means you sometimes may have to make a bet that you can get a quarter-sensitive requirement done with a class that you are actually interested in, all while optimizing for the minor. \n\nGood thing is that you can always try and back out if it is too much since you can always graduate with one degree. It is quite common for prospective and incoming students to want to maximize their Stanford time with 2 degrees + minor since you are paying for the same price anyway. But lots of first-year ambitions do get burnt out by third year in so not many end up with double degrees + minor. If you are one of those with conviction and passion, go for it. If you are on the edge because you still want to optimize for other things in life (personal, social, professional), then I would recommend reducing the load. \n\nMy credibility in answering this is having originally planned for double majoring (BA English, BS Management Science &amp; Engineering). I soon realized I could cut requirements down by coterming in MS&amp;E, all while saving enough time for a quarter abroad. I could have done it all in 4 consecutive years in total. Of note, I did five consecutive 20-unit quarters, interrupted only by a quarter abroad with limited choices, and I got lucky because the humanities/STEM combo naturally knocked out the general requirements. But due to my international status + covid pushing out internationals in 2020, I ended up staying an extra year for admin reasons but learned a lot for life. Hope this helps.",

You can \"almost major\" and \"almost minor\" in subjects that you like about as much as your major and gain the intellectual benefit without your hands being tied.",

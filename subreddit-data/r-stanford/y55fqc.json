    "postText": "I'm a new student at Stanford and I was looking for a good used hybrid/road bike (around $200). I've been checking the su post but the good bikes are either way too overpriced and the cheaper ones are either terrible or mountain/comfort bikes. Does anyone have any experience buying good used bikes? What bike did you get, where did you get them from and how much did you pay? What are some recommended places to buy bikes from?\nThanks!",

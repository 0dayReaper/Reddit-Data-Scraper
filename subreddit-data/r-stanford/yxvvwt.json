    "postText": "I know the Withdraw deadline is this Friday, but I'm a bit confused on what it means. After this deadline, are you unable to withdraw from any course, or even change it from letter grading to pass/no pass?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm asking because I just took a midterm for CHEM31M and it was really horrible, but I'm not exactly sure when those results will be coming out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",

I\u2019ll complete both of the classes definitely but don\u2019t know which one should go first in the summer quarter. Besides, I\u2019ll have an intern this summer. Could you guys give me any suggestions about which one to take? Thanks a lot!!",

            "comment": "The classes aren't really any close in difficultly, with EE263 being a significantly harder class. If you're ready for EE263 then CS109 will feel like high school review. If you need to learn the material from CS109 then EE263 is likely to be too difficult. Probably pick based on your comfort level with the material? My hunch is that if you did a remotely technical undergrad then CS109 will be way too easy for you - it's a watered down freshmen intro to probability.",

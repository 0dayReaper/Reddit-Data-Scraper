    "postText": "I will be attending a Master of Science program at Stanford University. Axess opens for autumn quarter enrollment on Sep 1, Bechtel International Center's Orientation starts on Sep 11, and classes start on Sep 26. New international students must arrive on campus before enrolling, but is it necessary to be early for enrollment? Do popular classes fill up? When is the latest I can arrive in the U.S., and what are your suggestions? Thank you in advance!",

                    "comment": "also...\n\n&gt;dystopian vision of a government that will do anything to control the narrative is timelier than ever\n\nI often argue with people about this. They take the book as a window in to how a government controls its people. But I think that ignores the other side of the lesson; fascism creates a populace that wants to be controlled. It kind of makes better sense when you see it both ways. Authoritarianism is a symbiotic relationship. \n\nThe party had a 3 tier motto: \n\n* War is Peace\n* Freedom is Slavery\n* Ignorance is Strength\n\nReaders often act like this is some private guidebook for the government on how to fool the people. But it isn't. It is literally their outward facing motto. It's not a mantra that people are forced to repeat so they can be brainwashed. It's the appeal. The people *believe these things to be true.* And because they believe them to be true they support the party.\n\nLook no further than what's happening right now. People believe these things to be true and they rally around the people who support these ideas. \n\n* If you are a strong man who tries to bully everyone around you and constantly threatens people with violence.... well that's the path to peace. Nobody messes with you.\n* If you give people too much liberty to think for themselves and make their own choices, that expands on ideas about what it means to be a respected member of society. The idea gets so muddied down and distorted that people become literal slaves to the confusion. Nobody knows who they are or what they should be doing and are therefore easily controlled. You have more freedom of course if you fit the mold.\n* Why would you admit you are wrong about anything? Why trust scientists? Or professors? Or experts? They will just shoot down your beliefs. Sometimes the higher truth is the one you believe to be true and you shouldn't be open to criticism from people who follow narrow minded rules around 'fact-finding'. If you band together with other like minded people, who know what is true by faith then you will be impervious to the criticisms of others. That's strength.\n\nThat's my take on it anyways. The people in 1984 want to be oppressed and it only seems different because we see the story through the eyes of the one person who doesn't.",

The Nuremberg defense doesn\u2019t apply to my interpretation, though it is adjacent. You got the military part right. These kids lived in an environment where orders were given and followed, in a military fashion. I worked with an Army Ranger who often pointed out that in team challenges that require initiative and creative solutions (like The Amazing Race on TV, but in real life as well), teams composed entirely of veterans tend to fare not so well because those situations favor collaboration over order of command. The kids in the story were thrown into a dangerous world and did their best to replicate the only functional society they knew. That functional society failed them in that moment. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the whole of the lesson. There is nuance and meaning to the imagery, and plenty to glean, but it is not the story of a supposed natural human tendency toward or desire for chaos that everyone says it is.\n\nAs for the appeal to superior orders - oof. I side with and oppose the idea in nearly equal measure.\n\nEdit forgot to add: regarding the statement that perhaps it\u2019s preferable to have a society that follows orders over their personal qualms - antivaxxers don\u2019t exist in that space.",

Unless you're superficial and reductive. You could use most science fiction books as a comparison to something that happens today. That doesn't meant they are teaching you anything. You're just projecting what you already know into them.\n\n&gt; I lived in China for a number of years where I saw that their total control and manipulation of everything people understand was very similar to these books. They recently announced a plan to create quotas of students that should go to university vs technical college &amp; into unskilled labor if that isn't brave new world then idk what is. \n\nYou found a thematic similarity. And now what? Nothing. All you did was take something you already knew and found something similar in an old book. \n\nBut if you want to go the other direction and use the book to extrapolate what will happen in the future: That doesn't work. Just because there are similarities that doesn't mean everything will become reality. China is not the same as the world in Brave New World. \n\nI'd argue that if you use these old books then you're missing the real problems because your understanding of society is warped. How are people manipulated in China? How does Chinese history and culture play into this? What can we do about? None of that can be answered by reading these books.\n\n&gt; Humans have a habit of classifying and quantifying items, including ourselves. Maybe this is the only way for an effective society to evolve, maybe not. Only time will tell.\n\nI don't know how that relates to the topic.",

Not here to argue with ya, and I know I'm biased; I've lived in China for a decade and yes, there are cameras everywhere but it really doesn't bother me in the slightest. If you're not doing anything wrong, who cares? If you're about to do something wrong, like commit a serious crime, that camera can either prevent you from doing so or enable law enforcement to find you easier. I'll give up my 'privacy' for the fact that I know with certainty that there will be NO violent crime occurring against me or my family here in China.",

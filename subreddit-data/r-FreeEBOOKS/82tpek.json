My understanding is you do not control the content that goes up for free only notify the user if it becomes available for free. Also it appears you offer a separate player for the audio files, is that required to use the chrome extension. \n\nThanks for the info and extension!",

So you will only be \"notified\" about a book if you are searching for it on audible. \n\nWe do offer an audiobook player app but it is not necessary to make the extension useful. We just think it's a good app to use once you download the free audiobooks :)",

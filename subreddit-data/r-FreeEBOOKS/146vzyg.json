Subsequently, the united Germany triggered World War I and II in the 20th century.

I heard that earthquakes are part of daily life in Tokyo; it also has frequent tsunamis, typhoons and floods as it is an island facing the violent Pacific ocean.  As a result, **I believe these natural disasters have made Japanese people nervous**; they have seeked for peace of mind more eagerly than others and preferred something stable.  I figure this is why the Japanese do not invest in stocks much; it's a cash oriented country with less credit card usage.  Stock markets are small since they cannot afford anything more dangerous; their lives are already in threat due to disasters.  It is a fact that the Japanese save more cash in the bank than others; which is a more conservative way of building wealth.\n\nJapan has a tradition to inherit parent's professions, even for generations.  **I believe the reason is that they feel more stable that way.**  Consequently, it has lots of old businesses with longer histories than others.  What I mean by \u201cold\u201d is like 500 years old in Japan.  I deduce that they feel more comfortable when there are things never changing but benefiting, while their environments are dynamic.\n\n**Do you know what is the most common point of those old Japanese restaurants?**  Above all, their sizes are small in general.  I have seen photos of a 500 year old Owariya udon place; their space is pretty small, too; guests have to wait in line basically forever; no seat is available until someone finishes the food.  Google shows that 80% of over 100 years old restaurants in the world are in Japan, statistically.  And their spaces are all small compared with those in Korea or America: **Why?**",

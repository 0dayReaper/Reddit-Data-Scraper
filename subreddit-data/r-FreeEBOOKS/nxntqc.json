    "title": "A Study in Scarlet is the very first novel to feature the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Doyle wrote it in just three weeks at the age of 27, and it's the first mystery story to feature a magnifying glass as an investigative tool!",

I was raised in the LDS church (\u201cMormon\u201d); I have a lot of respect for Doyle\u2019s writing, but it is hilariously clear that for this particular section, he was working off of a very limited set of facts.\n\nThat aside, this book is a good read. I do recommend.",

            "comment": "Jack Whittaker was a construction businessman in Putnam County, WV; he was known as the winner of a lottery jackpot of $315 Millions USD in the Powerball in 2002.  **It shows that he was a millionaire already with a net worth of $17 M even before winning**; in a word, a millionaire won a huge lottery.  He must be the luckiest guy on Earth, right?  Wrong!\n\nStrangely, a series of unfortunate events happened to him for no apparent reason after winning.   First of all, a boy named Jesse Tribble, who was the boyfriend of Whittaker's granddaughter Brandi Bragg, was found dead from drug overdose in Whittaker's home in September, 2004; three months later, Brandi Bragg herself was also found dead on the property of a male friend in December, 2004; it shows that cocaine and methadone were found in her body; she was only 17 at the time of death.\n\nSubsequently, Ginger Bragg, who was the mother of Brandi Bragg and Whittaker's daughter (42), was also found dead in Daniels, WV in 2009; the police suspected that  the cause could be drug overdose again.   Then, Whittaker's home in Bland County, VA, was reported to be on fire in December, 2016.  Finally, Jack Whittaker himself passed away following a long illness in June, 2020.  It shows that he had frequently visited casinos and strip clubs when he was alive; I guess lack of sleep and disorganized lifestyle could have brought him an illness.",

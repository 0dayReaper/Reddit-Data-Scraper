It is an improvement over the original.\n\nThe world Hodgson has constructed is very interesting and seems different from any I\u2019ve yet experienced. He thoroughly ruined that with the anachronistic, repetitive, misogynistic prose. I\u2019d like to emphasize that I don\u2019t toss around the accusation of misogyny lightly. That term is barely in my vocabulary. I resisted the urge to label this story misogynistic for many pages before even I tired of the well-meaning physical abuse and archaic gender roles.\n\nThe ending was trite and predictable.",

However, when I get a free ebook on Amazon via this sub, if there's an audiobook version available then you can get that on Audible at a reduced cost ranging between $1.99-$7.99 but more often than not on the lower end of that scale.\n\nOther than that I used my COVID Stimulus money to take advantage of the frequent huge sales Audible ran during the pandemic, especially in 2020. They kept alternating between $5 sales and 2-for-1 sales which if you bought 1 year gift cards for yourself drove the cost of credits down to about $5.80 per audiobook on the 2-for-1 sales. Each of those pandemic sales had a theme so one would be heavy with fantasy titles, the next horror, then sci-fi, then mystery, back to fantasy and on and on. I figured it was my own tax money being given back to me so I might as well spend it on something that would last me a lifetime, and I keep a file with updated passwords to Audible and my digital movie accounts so in the event of my death my kids will have access to all of that content throughout their lifetimes too.",

Pretty much all of them I got for free. Must have deleted 30 books which probably isn't that much to someone. They've just been sitting there staring at me when I turn on my kindle.\n\nI've realized lately how stingy I am when it comes to entertainment. I'll avoid purchasing games and books I am actually interested in and just read or play stuff I get for free.\n\nBut I realized there's no point in doing something I'm not interested in. I value my time too much now to waste on things I don't care about.\n\nI've actually stopped claiming free books and games unless it's something I've actually wanted to try previously.",

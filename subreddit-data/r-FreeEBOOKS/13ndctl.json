    "postText": "To Redditors,\n\nIn 2018, I developed an advanced stage 4 melanoma. I received immunotherapy that took me from being near death to in remission within 3 years. \n\nThe treatment was very toxic and I developed medical conditions and disabilities because of them.\n\nIt was a difficult journey to go through. I ve come through the otherside. Part of what helped me was to put everything I learned into a book (with my wife's help). \n\nThis book is about adapting to any adult onset disability and empowering your life\n\nI've e-published the book for free and its available for free through Smashwords, kobo and other sites as a epub file.\n\nThere are no advertisements, no catch. I just want to try to help ppl who may be going through a similar situation. Its free.\n\nTitle:\nDisabled101: Adult Onset Disability in an Ableist World\n\nSmashwords\nhttps://www.smashwords.com/books/view/1394712?ref=\n\nKobo\nhttps://www.kobo.com/ca/en/ebook/disabled-101-adult-onset-disability-in-an-ableist-world\n\nThanks.\nMJ Kuhn",

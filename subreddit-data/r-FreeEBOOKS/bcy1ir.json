It s like travelling into another civilisation. Everything is different.\n\nThe tools, the way the house was organized, the hours long everything took to be made or repaired. \nWho knew they used kerozene as a cleaning product ? \n\nHow the fuck did uneducated people who could neither read nor write survived? Everything has to be planned ahead, and every task taking 2 or 3 hours you need to plan your day accordingly. It is insane.\n\nI loved reading a whole chapter on lighting devices and how to care for them from candles to gaz lights. \n\nHow to take care of babies and toddlers was so weird to weird as well.\n\nDoing all of that without a car, with 4 kids and no help, and if you cannot read or write, without being able to keep notes of anything must have been incredible. Obviously these books were for the educated and rich, but I cannot help wondering how life was for the poors if it was that hard for the rich. Without planning my whole day on paper and putting alarms on my phone to remember when to check if the dough has risen enough or butter is done I would not be able to go through the day.\n\nNowadays we are so lucky to be able to google whatever recipes we need and have videos showing the proper way. No wonder some heirs would fight to have an old grandma cookbook after her death. Family recipes were all you got. \n\nI wish I had an old oven though. Eveything is electric in my home and cooking anything for more than an hour would be for Christmas only. Otherwise it s too expensive lol\n\n\nBack to reading. \n\nThank you so much for sharing.",

Gives me old-timey Binging With Babish vibes:\n&gt;The appetite for this dish must be approached from the windy side of a promontory in early spring with a sixty pound pack between the shoulder blades, aforementioned pack to contain for a couple of congenial souls a pound of bacon, a pound of dry onions, two cans of corn and one large tin of condensed milk.\n\n&gt;Cut the bacon up into small half inch squares and start it frying. Simultaneously slice the onions and give them the heat. If, after the aroma from these two begins to permeate the air, you feel like risking their falling into the fire, start boiling the corn and milk. Before the onions are too thoroughly cooked stir them into the bacon, at which time the battle for the supremacy of the appetizing odors is occupying most of your attention.\n\n&gt;Now throw the bacon and onions into the corn pot and wait as long as you are able so that the ingredients become thoroughly familiar with one another.\n\n&gt;Write me as soon as you get home if you don\u2019t remember that day until you are an old man.\n\n&gt;To make this sound extremely professional I suppose I should add, \u201cSeason to taste,\u201d but do not mind if a few ashes get mixed in by mistake.",

I believe looking at how people ate to be a great way of understanding people from the past.

She's a mindfulness teacher and as our daughter's grown (she's 7 now) we thought it was a valuable skill for everyone -- the ability to truly enjoy the world around you and focus more on the positive. So we wrote this book. Enjoy.",

But we do think it's SUCH an important skill to have, especially in this age where you can so easily be bombarded by an endless stream of the negative (which is what your brain focuses on naturally). We think giving children the ability to learn to focus on the positive at a young age will make for a lifetime of happiness.",

He doesn't like to do it, and he throws a fit whenever I instruct him to do it but he has admitted that whenever he does a session he always feels much better afterwards. I noticed positive effects for up to 20 hours after the meditation session. We use the \"Headspace\" app. They have meditation sessions that are short as one minute and as long as 15 or even overnight (it's just soothing music). I have heard that the \"Calm\" app also works really well but headspace worked well with my son when we did a trial of each. I also bought him a coping skills for kids notebook, but he honestly doesn't seem too interested in it. I'm going to try to introduce him to it again when he's into better mood because it seems like if he has any other mental undercurrents going on he can't really absorb what I'm saying. If he is not medicated or has missed a pill he absolutely will not listen to suggestions like this. Meditation has become effective only if he's currently medicated, got enough sleep, etc. He has bad days just like we all do but you know what I mean. In the beginning even a 30-second meditation was so torturous that he would scream. It was unbearable for both of us. It only became better after daily attempts. \n\nEven though my son has ADHD he is an avid reader, so if he is interested in something he can read about it for hours, medicated or not. Another resource that was vital to us was a book called \"Feeling Good\" by David D. Burns. My son's father, who has ADHD as well, suggested it because he found it helpful and they read it together. It helped my son become interested in developing his own coping techniques and more emotionally invested in becoming educated about his condition. I know it won't work for everyone, but it worked for us. it's very dry though so he could usually only read for 15 minutes at a time before he was overwhelmed.\n\nHe's also found that squeezing a stress ball at periodic intervals when he's upset does wonders. There's one on Amazon that has a string attached so he can have it attached to his wrist and wait around the house. He also uses it at school when he's overwhelmed but he can't really leave the situation. I had them write it into his 504 plan.\n\nI'm so glad that you were able to ask for help. It's been a struggle to get my son to be interested in helping himself, but I feel like we're finally moving in an upward direction. But that could change in a moment, like I'm sure you know.",

At the moment his problem is the frustration when he has to stop gaming. There is a time limit, but lately he fights it every time. I think learning awareness of his own feelings would help him with this. As you said too, with medication it's easier, but he \"crashes\" in the evening and I'd like to handle this without adding a short term stimulant. And if he can learn some skills instead, they last for his whole life...\n\nThe stress ball is a great idea. Lately he took to a ping-pong paddle and ball, but that drives us kind of crazy... \ud83d\ude02\n\nI'm so invested in this that I'm looking into becoming an ADHD coach myself. There's no one where we live, and the (limited choice of) therapy didn't help much.

I am pretty sure that they give warnings before the lock sets in so maybe if he had some warning he wouldn't get so frustrated. Maybe his frustration stems from not having any warning that it's going to shut off. What about setting a big digital timer beside him to give him a countdown?",

I learned to \"disguise\" my shortcomings so well that I functioned it great for 2,5 decades... then the pressure became too much and I started with other health problems, a burnout, anxiety, the lot. Then again, learned to adjust to new situations and so on. But I'm kind of relieved now that I *know* why I struggle so much with certain things...\n\nI'll definitely look on the parental lock system. How didn't I think about it!? \n\nWe agree on a time, I give him warnings, the last one I say \"OK, wrap it up, in 10 minutes is time\"... the think is he's become defiant, and plainly answers \"NO.\" I think it can be also normal adolescence, it's quite the combo, right?\n\nHow old is your son? Have you checked r/ADHD? It's a lovely sub. I started there to see if I could find some hacks for my son, ended up staying and feeling a sense of community :)",

Or you could try asking his psychiatrist to split his prescription into two smaller doses. He would take one at breakfast and one at lunch and it extends the effects. If My son's current methylphenidate dose didn't work that was going to be our next option.",

My German is half decent, but with some help from friends I might make it. But I can't 100% promess!\n\nI will definitely check the 5 minutes Mindfulness Meditations for Teens.

Thanks very much.\n\n\\-Lewis\n\nBTW, [here's a link to a free ebook](https://dogoodu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-Ways-you-can-Do-Good.pdf) I wrote for adults called 5 Ways You Can Do Good. You guys have nailed that \"teach\" category! In fact I have a paragraph in there that could have been written about your book:\n\n\"There is a form of magic you can perform, however. You can turn a frown into a smile. You can change someone's bad day into a good day. In fact you can go beyond changing moments and changing days all the way into changing lives.\"",

    "postText": "The good news here is you only have to set this up one time - it is rather confusing and many many people miss the step of whitelisting the email they will be using to send books to their kindle.  It is one of the most common things I see confusion about in r/FreeEBOOKS.\n\n\n[Here is an article about the release of works to the public domain](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/first-time-20-years-copyrighted-works-enter-public-domain-180971016/)\n\n[Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) is one of the main sources for free public domain ebooks.\n\nEbooks added this way will sync across devices like any ebook you get from Amazon. \n\n\n\nPlease ask questions in the comments below if you are having trouble figuring this out - I plan to edit the instructions as I find where folks are confused. \n\n\n# 1 - Find your send to kindle email address\n\nFirst you need to find your send to kindle email address. There are two ways to do this on your kindle or on the Amazon website, it\u2019s way easier to find on your kindle.  \n\n\n**Easy way: On your kindle: Click the gear icon -&gt; All Settings -&gt; Your Account -&gt; your send to kindle email will be listed on this page.**\n\n\nHarder way: Go to [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) then click Accounts &amp; lists-&gt; \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/up315qw13h721.jpg\n\n \n\n\nunder \u201cDigital content and devices\u201d click \u201cContent and Devices\u201d -&gt; \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bfxxh6a53h721.png\n\n \n\n\nClick \u201cDevices\u201d in the menu near the top -&gt;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/94bpbnx63h721.png\n\n \n\n\nclick the \u201c\u2026\u201d next to you kindle in the device list you see on that page. Your send to kindle email will be listed in the small box that appears.  If you are on mobile you will see a gallery of images of kindles and app icons - click a kindle and you will see your send to kindle email address displayed below.  \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/id3hyxh83h721.png\n\n \n\n\n(Do not be alarmed if you see a shitload of devices listed, every time you download the kindle app on something it counts as a device - I have \u201cdevices\u201d going back for many years of phones) \n\nYour send to kindle email address will be some variation on your name + @kindle.com\n\n\n\n \n\n# 2 - Make sure the email you will be sending emails from to your send to kindle email address is whitelisted. If the email you send books from to your kindle is not white listed you will never get the books.\n\n \n\nOn [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) click \u201cAccount &amp; Lists\u201d -&gt; \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6uzd07wj3h721.jpg\n\n \n\nunder \u201cDigital content and devices\u201d click \u201cContent and Devices\u201d -&gt;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/0sbp037l3h721.png\n\n\n\n\nclick \u201cPreferences\" in the top bar of that page -&gt; \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/33gegntn3h721.png\n\n \n\nClick \u201cPersonal Document Settings\u201d -&gt; \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xv33a2eq3h721.png\n\n \n\nfind \u201cApproved Personal Document E-mail List\u201d on that page -&gt; make sure the email you will be using to send books to your kindle is listed there.  \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cyzhtkor3h721.png\n\n\n\n\n# 3 - Let\u2019s send a book.  \n\n \n\nGo to a book on [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=downloads) \\-&gt; click either Kindle (with images) or Kindle (no images) to download the version of the ebook you would like to send to your kindle. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8r8zroxw3h721.png\n\n \n\nNow open a new email message - fill in your send to kindle email address in the to field, then drag the book file into the email. Click send.  \n\nGo to your kindle library and sync to make sure the book downloaded.  \n\nI typically send ebooks to my kindle from my phone or iPad - you will follow the same process but often when you download a file your device will ask you what you want to do with the file - just choose email and send away.  \n\nHere are some lists of free ebooks by topic:\n\n[100 free mythology books](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/9qep6e/heres_a_list_of_100_free_mythology_and_folklore/)\n\n[250 free kids and YA books](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/9rkjqc/here_is_a_list_ive_compiled_of_250_free_yakids/)\n\n[200 free sci-fi books](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/9tvcyj/here_is_a_list_of_200_free_scifi_ebooks_ive/)\n\n[100 free classics](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/9vy4oa/the_top_100_free_classic_ebooks_from_project/)\n\n[100 free Christmas ebooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/a5y4cg/here_is_a_list_of_100_free_christmas_ebooks_ive/)\n\n[100 free history ebooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/a9hsti/here_are_100_free_history_ebooks_from_project/)\n\n[100 free poetry books](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/a9u60i/here_are_100_free_poetry_ebooks_from_project/)\n\n[100 free memoirs and autobiographies](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/abaywb/here_are_100_free_ebooks_of_memoirs_and/)",

I wish Rakuten would just have an \"email EPUBs to this address and they become a permanent part of your account and they get synced to all your devices with your progress and whatnot\" would be great. I have a couple of eReaders, and trying to keep them relatively consistent with the same files and manually managing them is a pain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo physically get the files on my readers isn't the problem - it's just how easy amazon makes it that annoys me a little.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: If you're curious, to get an eBook from Amazon onto a Kobo, you have to have a specific, old legacy version of Kindle for PC installed, buy the books on Amazon, download them, then find the AZW or .mobi or whatever (I forget) files on your computer. From there you have to install Calibre, and a specific addon I don't even remember that breaks Amazon's DRM (because they're free as in beer, but not free as in speech), import the files, convert to EPUB, and sync to the device. \n\nAny place that lets you download an EPUB is much easier, you can just drop them on the device, or import to Calibre then drop on the device. Still, those are then on that device, and not my Kobo library, so nothing syncs to other devices. ",

He says it as if it\u2019s the most logical reason in the world to hold a prejudice.\n\nLovecraft was an educated and well-off white man who believed all other groups were simple-minded savages and moral degenerates, so he wrote about a world where rationalism was a lie humans invented to keep ourselves sane and ancient cults perform horrific rituals to worship inhuman creatures with impossible powers.",

And people who finance the movies would obviously want giant monsters to be the focus, because they think it would attract more viewers. For example, Utopia is a tv series I\u2019ve watched that is a conspiracy thriller, but the atmosphere is done so well that it could easily have been converted to a lovecraft-style television show.

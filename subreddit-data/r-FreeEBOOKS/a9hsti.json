I do recommend doing some separate reading on the topics of these books to provide added context on the events they describe.\n\nThis list is largely books about the United States and the UK and that is reflective of the content that is most often seen on Project Gutenberg.

That said, the first hand accounts are often more accurate than the books historians write, trying to balance conflicting accounts.\n\nI'd add to the list, \"London to Ladysmith via Pretoria,\" by Churchill .. It is delightfully funny, and probably quite accurate, without going into the deeper issues or later events of the Boer war. It's also a prime example of the author shaping the narrative to portray himself as the hero, a time honored tradition that more or less began with Julius Caesar.",

The lawsuit was concerned with 18 eBooks, by three authors, which are part of the Project Gutenberg collection.\n\n&gt; The lawsuit was filed in the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court, in Germany.\n\n&gt; The Plaintiff is S. Fischer Verlag, GmbH. Hedderichstrasse 114, 60956 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. They are represented by the law firm, Waldorf Frommer of Munich.\n\n&gt; The essence of the lawsuit is that the Plaintiff wants the 18 eBooks to no longer be accessible, at least from Germany. It also seeks punitive damages and fines.\n\n&gt; Based on legal advice from its US attorneys, PGLAF declined to remove or block the items. The lawsuit proceeded, with a series of document filings by both sides, and hearings before the judges (all of which occurred in German, in the German court). PGLAF hired a German law firm, Wilde Beuger Solmecke, in K\u00f6ln, to represent it in Germany.\n\n&gt; On February 9 2018, the Court issued a judgement granting essentially all of the Plaintiff's demands.",

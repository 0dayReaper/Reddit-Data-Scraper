While it is a work of fiction, it brought to light the horrible working conditions of the Chicago meat-packing industry at the beginning of the 20th century.",

I remember seeing a quote from Teddy Roosevelt that The Jungle was the best argument/most convincing thing he'd seen in favor of socialism, so I don't think it's on Sinclair that his book was so poorly received.",

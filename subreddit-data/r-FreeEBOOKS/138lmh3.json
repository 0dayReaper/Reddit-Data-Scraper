However, if you're asking whether I used ChatGPT through the development process, then you've hit the nail on the head.\r  \n\r  \nThe book consists of a collection of prompts, with all the responses generated by ChatGPT and occasionally BingChat. Moreover, there's a section in the book where I demonstrate a series of prompts specifically designed to help analyze text and suggest potential improvements. Naturally, I apply these techniques to my own writing as well.",

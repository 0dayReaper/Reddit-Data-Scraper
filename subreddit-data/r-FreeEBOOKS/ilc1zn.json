Not only does it elucidate the background for The Count of Monte Cristo, it does an incredible job of succinctly detailing French imperialism, slavery, Napoleon's brutal regression of rights, and the process by which history has nearly erased one of the most storied military heroes in all French history.",

The way Tom Reiss was able to piece together Alex Dumas' story and cross verify the information is pretty neat too. \n\n*A man almost unknown today yet with a personal story that is strikingly familiar. His swashbuckling exploits appear in The Three Musketeers, and his triumphs and ultimate tragic fate inspired The Count of Monte Cristo. His name is Alex Dumas. Father of the novelist Alexandre Dumas, Alex has become, through his son's books, the model for a captivating modern protagonist: The wronged man in search of justice.\n\nBorn to a black slave mother and a fugitive white French nobleman in Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti), Alex Dumas was briefly sold into bondage but then made his way to Paris where he was schooled as a sword-fighting member of the French aristocracy.\n\nHe was only 32 when he was given command of 53,000 men, the reward for series of triumphs that many regarded as impossible, and then topped his previous feats by leading a raid up a frozen cliff face that secured the Alps for France. It was after his subsequent heroic service as Napoleon\u2019s cavalry commander that Dumas was captured and cast into a dungeon - and a harrowing ordeal commenced that inspired one of the world\u2019s classic works of fiction.\n\nThe Black Count is simultaneously a riveting adventure story, a lushly textured evocation of 18th-century France, and a window into the modern world\u2019s first multi-racial society. But it is also a heartbreaking story of the enduring bonds of love between a father and son. Drawing on hitherto unknown documents, letters, battlefield reports and Dumas' handwritten prison diary, The Black Count is a groundbreaking masterpiece of narrative nonfiction.*",

The Penguin Books version translated by Robin Buss is usually recognized as the best available English language translation. Unfortunately it is not free (unless you find a \"shared\" version). But its *worth it.* \n\nI read about half of a poor translation and had a bad time. I started over with the Buss translation and it flew by. It's just better. The Buss translation is far more natural and easy to read. Here's the second sentence of the free ebook:\n\n&gt; As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Ch\u00e2teau\nd\u2019If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.\n\nAnd here's the Buss translation:\n\n&gt; As usual, a coastal pilot immediately left the port, sailed hard by the Ch\u00e2teau d'If, and boarded the ship between the Cap de Morgiou and the island of Riou.\n\nThe difference is slight here, but multiply that by 700+ pages and it makes a difference. And there are other, more problematic, issues than what's on page one. This \"free\" translation at least has the correct date (Feb 24, 1815) on page 1 . Several do *not*.\n\nAs for abridged version - I'll let you fight that battle ;)",

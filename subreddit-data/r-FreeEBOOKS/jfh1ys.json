    "title": "Although Carmilla is a lesser-known Gothic vampire story than the generally-considered masterwork of the genre, Dracula, the latter is heavily influenced by Le Fanu's short story. Carmilla stands as one of the richest, most literate and most enduring stories in the history of the vampire sub-genre.",

It was published the same year as Stoker\u2019s Dracula and addresses many similar themes but from the perspective of a female vampire that never penetrates her victims skin. It\u2019s interesting that vampire tales that feature a female protagonist have not enjoyed the same endurance in popular culture as Dracula. \n\n(I\u2019m writing my PhD on a comparison of the 19th C Freak Show and Gothic Literature)",

She has appeared in numerous titles in the video game series as well so this isn't just something thrown in for the Netflix anime adaption.",

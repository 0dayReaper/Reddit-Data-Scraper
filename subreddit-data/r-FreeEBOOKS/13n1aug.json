Once in a while I write short stories, which explore the way people deal with dissatisfaction, changes, and interpersonal relationships.\n\n\"Parent's Digest\" is a story about a London couple trying to reconcile their busy lives with the prospect of having a baby. Eventually, something or somebody will have to compromise.\n\nI've always wanted to write, to answer the question \"what if\", and have taken the plunge to create a [Goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/29541706.Ignat_Drozdov). I hope you enjoy the concept and the story.",

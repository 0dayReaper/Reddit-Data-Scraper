But, for a lot of them, that's simply focusing on the symptoms, not the root causes. That's why they learn that while they stopped using news media, they still use social media like Reddit \ud83d\ude09 Here, they still get the news. Or they might get it from their friends, or in passing from digital billboards. For them, the solution usually is a more gradual one involving a level of self-understanding and self-acceptance, which is the focus of my book.",

It got very bad. \n\nI see your point about symptom vs cause. I\u2019ll grab your book and get educated. Thanks for the reply!",

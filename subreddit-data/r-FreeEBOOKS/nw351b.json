Available from [the Project Gutenberg download](https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/10662) it has 464 pages, it opens with two poems, and as a sample of the writing style, here are the first three paragraphs:\n\n&gt; It was the Joy of the Sunset that brought us to speech. I was gone a long way from my house, walking lonely-wise, and stopping often that I view the piling upward of the Battlements of Evening, and to feel the dear and strange gathering of the Dusk come over all the world about me.\n&gt; \n&gt; The last time that I paused, I was truly lost in a solemn joy of the Glory of the Coming Night; and maybe I laughed a little in my throat, standing there alone in the midst of the Dusk upon the World. And, lo! my content was answered out of the trees that bounded the country road upon my right; and it was so as that some one had said: \"And thou also!\" in glad understanding, that I laughed again a little in my throat; as though I had only a half-believing that any true human did answer my laugh; but rather some sweet Delusion or Spirit that was tuned to my mood.\n&gt; \n&gt; But she spoke and called me by my name; and when I had gone to the side of the road, that I should see her somewhat, and discover whether I knew her, I saw that she was surely that lady, who for her beauty was known through all of that sweet County of Kent as Lady Mirdath the Beautiful; and a near neighbour to me; for the Estates of her Guardian abounded upon mine.",

You can play as yourself or as a character you make up or whatever. There are \u2018things\u2019 in the ever-present black night that\u2019s engulfs the world and you play out the final hours or days of a character in a small group (usually 3~5 players including a \u2018game master\u2019)\u2026\n\nYou literally light ten candles at the start of the game, play out several scenes, and as the candles go out - whether naturally or from the folks at the table hooting in elation when they survive a stressful situation or just moving slightly too much - shit gets worse and worse. When the final candle goes out, it\u2019s assumed that the characters have died and the final light of hope they had with them.",

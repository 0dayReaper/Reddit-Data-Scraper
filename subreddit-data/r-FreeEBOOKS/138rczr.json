The protagonist was expecting a bigger celebration than in the US and gets sad theres nothing here, unless theres a touristic spot with mostly americans or the city of Puebla.  \n\n\nI'm very glad you are celebrating and having fun, by the way.",

It's only really celebrated in the state of Puebla, where it's the most important holiday of the year for them, with basically every town having a big celebration.\n\nThe rest of the country knows it's the day the Battle of Puebla took place and that it's a holiday, but you don't get the day off, so nobody really cares. \n\nThey will occasionally give school children the day off if it's convenient, like today because it was a Friday (at least that's what happened here in Mexico City) which made the traffic a bit more bearable today.",

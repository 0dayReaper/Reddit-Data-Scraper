The person I was writing had mental issues so I'd like to ask you how accurate what he said was. \n   He claimed the last two years of a UK inmate include \"house release\" say for months 18-24 before you are released, you leave the prison one weekend each month. Months 12-18, you leave twice a month. All the way until the last few months you do a half/most of your living outside prison, but must report back.\n  If, for any reason, you have a violation: fail drug test, come back with alcohol, commit a crime, you must start that two years over, after serving additional time, if a crime was committed.\n   Is that in the ballpark?\n   I find that fascinating, although thinking on it, I imagine it would be tough to find a job that lets you keep going back to prison.",

There are lots of conditions attached and lots of variations.  I found this web page you may find useful. https://www.prisonersfamilies.org/release-temporary-licence/   There are some typos on this page but it is written by charity volunteers. I saw something on TV about a prisoner let out early with an ankle tag.  He was only allowed out of his flat between certain hours of the day.  A telephone was installed in his home with a sensor, and a probation officer would ring him at 7pm to check he was home.  If he didn't answer the phone, he wasn't home so had broken the curfew and would have to go back to prison to finish his full sentence.  He had a date with a woman and had to run home in the middle.  But he did get a job as a lifeguard in a public swimming pool.  I suppose he wouldn't have got a job at all if he was only allowed out once a week.",

I released book 2 a week or so ago and I'm still curious how people will react to it. Some more personal philosophy and dark moments in my life in there.

You have to download the Adobe reader app, but it is very clunky and makes poor renderings of physically scanned pages.\n\nTo download it, \u201cborrow\u201d a book and then scroll down below the downloadable files. There is a section with fine print that that gives the directions and links you\u2019ll need.\n\nAfter finding it and going through the whole process, however, I decided it wasn\u2019t really worth it. The quality is pretty low and turning pages is way more difficult than it should be.",

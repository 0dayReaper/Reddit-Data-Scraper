    "postText": "With everyone cooped up during this coronavirus outbreak, I thought now would be a good time to offer my two novels [Splashdown: First Contact?]( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G7U94LI) and the sequel [Earth Rising]( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0795C1YNC) free for the next five days on Kindle. \n\nSplashdown tells a different story of first contact with extraterrestrials. L\u2019atel is the pilot of an alien cargo ship who is illegally hauling passengers through our solar system when an accident forces them to crash-land on Earth.\n\nAs L\u2019atel and his passengers know, Earth is a primitive planet that has been placed off limits by the Ebens, the self appointed guardians of the galaxy. No outsider is allowed to land or even approach within one light year of Earth to protect its fragile culture. Or at least that is what the Ebens want the rest of the galaxy to believe.\n\nSoon L\u2019atel and his passengers discover that all is not as it appears. The Ebens have secrets, and will go to any length to protect them, even if it means war, with the Earth as the battleground.\n\nEarth Rising picks up five years after the events of Splashdown: First Contact?, While most of his passengers had eventually returned to their home-worlds, L'atel and one of his female passengers, Pan\u2019niah, had chosen to remain on Earth. They married and settled in Las Vegas Nevada becoming the first two actual space aliens to hold a Resident Alien Card issued by the United States Government.\n\nMankind is poised to become a part of the cosmic community. Alien technology is filtering into the consumer marketplace. Alliances have been formed and treaties signed. Soon, by hook or crook, mankind will have interstellar capability, despite the attempts of the Ebens to block us. Mankind is about to become much more than a pawn in a galactic chess game. But to the Ebens, who have played the part of the queen for thousands of years, there is no room on the board for anything but pawns, and they will do anything make sure that it stays that way.",

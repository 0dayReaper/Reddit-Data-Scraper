The vastness and fantastical nature of Star Wars couples with the story telling of the MCU.\n\nI'm working on building lore on my worldanvil page to accompany the books and to have a place for all the details that didn't make it into the books. It's a way of appeasing my wild imagination that comes up with stuff that I just can't justify throwing into the books as info dumps.\n\nThis will be my life's work. I already have about 20 books outlined. Just have to write them when we can. I'm also trying to wrangle my wife into writing. She's pretty good and is insanely fun to worldbuild with.\n\nA review would be incredibly helpful! \n\nI'll be posting books and short stories on the regular. \n\nMy goal is to have my fan base on Patreon where I'll post all the books, short stories and lore. I also post finished chapters there as I'm going. That way there is a constant flow of content.",

If the \"historical\" version of jesus was a real person that didn't do all those magic tricks attributed to the made-up version of jesus, then **they aren't the same character**.  The \"historical\" jesus bears no actual resemblance to the fictional character in the bible, which in turn bears no resemblance to the deranged bigot the evangelical death cult worships.",

            "comment": "It's a short book and a quick read. It speaks to chords, chord progression, form (verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus for example), and a bit on inspiration. What is interesting is the author is never named. No bio or, more importantly, examples of their work. \n\nI apologize to the author is reading this and I'm wrong, but I thought it might be an AI-written book. There is nothing incredibly original or specific. It would probably take a couple dozen inquiries to an AI and some human editing to put this together. That said, if you've never written a song and want to get the basics, they are here.",

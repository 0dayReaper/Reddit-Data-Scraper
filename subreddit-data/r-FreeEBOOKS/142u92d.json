            "comment": "My debut novel is available until 6/9/23, and I'd love for you all to check it out! Here's the blurb if anyone is interested: \n\nWhat if your entire life was a charade and everyone you knew wasn\u2019t really who you thought they were?\r  \n\r  \nMakana, a laid-back high school student, discovers just that. Growing up in a quiet Hawaiian town has always been easy. Though she enjoys her calm life, she dreams of adventure beyond her idyllic island home.\r  \nEverything changes when Charr, the new girl in town, arrives with secrets about who Makana really is. The revelations will shake her to the core. As if questioning her entire identity isn\u2019t bad enough, Makana finds out there are countless worlds beyond her own. Each of them is in danger from a mysterious being, known as the Queen, and her army of followers, the Wasps.\r  \nWith the worlds at stake, Makana must decide if she\u2019s willing to pay the price of losing everyone she loves for a fight that she never wanted to begin with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf possible, I'd love it if you gave it an honest review on Goodreads, Amazon, and/or Instagram. I've been told that Amazon gives books a little more 'love' when it has 50 reviews. I'm at 14 reviews, so I'm a long way from that, but every review helps. Thank you!",

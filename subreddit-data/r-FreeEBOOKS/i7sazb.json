Worked up to a management position, but COVID put the small business I worked for out. Underemployment now, was buying storage units to earn enough to survive, but that's some hard work for medium pay. (Better than zero).\n   I don't need help with promotion. It's a nice gesture, but if this ever blew up, I'd hate my life. Prison, and the past me, are two things I've moved on from.\n   I tried to launch it anonymous, but people are hate-filled savages (way more than I ever was) and here it is. Writing the diary got me through prison, that's really enough. It earns about $30 a month, which is a point of pride. I plan to type them all out, but the more time passes, when I go back and reread them, they make me sad. I'm do not support our current prison model. It could be the most insane bit of reality in our world.",

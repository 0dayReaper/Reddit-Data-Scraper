We look for real reviews that mention product issues such as counterfeits, defects, and bad return policies that fake reviews try to hide from consumers.*\n\n*We give an A-F letter for trustworthiness of reviews. A = very trustworthy reviews, F = highly untrustworthy reviews. We also provide seller ratings to warn you if the seller can be trusted or not.*",

The title of the post doesn't tell much,  so here's the description from the Amazon page\n\n&gt;In the not too distant future, a technological phenomenon known simply as \u201cthe screen\u201d has taken its place at the forefront of society. Allowing much of life to be lived in a virtual environment, the screen has essentially sent much of daily life in the physical realm the way of the dodo. People are adapting quite well, actually, never mind the increasing prevalence of a mysterious neurological disease.\n\n&gt;Misha is one of the rare few who misses the old days when people actually interacted with each other in the real world. Forced to conform to a culture borne out of the modern technology, she struggles to maintain a grip on her own sense of self as well as her physical health. When a series of events lead her closer than she\u2019d ever imagined to the heart of the screen\u2019s true nature, Misha finds herself face to face with an important question, the answer to which her very survival may depend upon.",

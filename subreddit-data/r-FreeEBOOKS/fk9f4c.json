Everyone is only 1-2 degrees away from someone who is a high risk, so it\u2019s definitely important for everyone to take as much precaution as possible, for the sake of not only themselves but everyone else as well.\nBut definitely a good point! Cabin fever, lack of sunlight, etc. Not good things, especially for people who aren\u2019t used to prolonged periods of isolation! Would a park or something out in the open be an option for you? From what I\u2019ve heard, places like Starbucks and any retail-type shops that are still open have been quite busy because people have nowhere else to go, which sort of negates the whole point of places shutting out lol.\n\n(And omg! I\u2019m so sorry to hear they treated you that way!! Good grief. It\u2019s a global pandemic, you would think they would be a tad more understanding than that \ud83d\ude24)",

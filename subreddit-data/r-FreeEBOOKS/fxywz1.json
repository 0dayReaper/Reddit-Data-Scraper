Hell, even txt. If you're ripping azw anyway damn... make it into epub as well :)\n\nPS I also use Moonreader and I love it. Couldn't live without it.",

Some (text)books need to be landscape on my phone, but I hate that for most other books. It is a pain to take a break from my text with a novel and have to switch orientation settings every time.\n\nI have very few other complaints. I know there are some e-ink tablets now that run Android. If that trend continues, I might honestly still download Moonreader over their native apps! For certain things it is fantastic.\n\nSumatraPDF is my go-to for PC, though. It rocks.",

The email also had the Audible free-to-stream site link for YA &amp; below book, and the month to two month free trials of Premium channels on Amazon Video.

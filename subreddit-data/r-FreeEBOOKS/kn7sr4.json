So thank you to those sharing this link and also to whomever has scanned and assembled these important works.\n\nIt appears though that in Vol1, section David Strauss, there is at least one or more missing pages and so appears to start mid-paragraph. I\u2019m not convinced that one error is an indication of many errors, but I do fear that this might be a frustrating read if more of these gaps appear in the book(s).\n\nBe so warned.",

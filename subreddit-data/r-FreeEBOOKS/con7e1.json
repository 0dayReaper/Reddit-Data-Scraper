This article is mainly about how NY public library has made the job easier for the projects which are **already** distributing these ebooks.\n\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/\n\nhttps://archive.org/index.php\n\n(It's worth noting that the Internet Archive doesn't always vet its contents.  Some things uploaded there may not actually be public domain.  But, if that doesn't bother you, download away.)",

Now that these are in the public domain, I\u2019ll be able to read even more. I firmly believe I can be the smartest man in history.",

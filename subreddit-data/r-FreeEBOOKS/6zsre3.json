See Duke Law's \"Public Domain Day\"for a listing of many items that were scheduled to enter the public domain, but have yet to do so because of the 1998 extension. Some notable items scheduled to enter the public domain in 2019 include Felix Salten's \"Bambi\" and Kahlil Gibran's \"The Prophet.\" ",

They're desperate not to let Mickey Mouse enter the public domain and they will spend millions (and millions) to lobby and bribe every time they need to to keep pushing things back from that date. Copyright has been extended repeatedly because of them\n\nThere's no sane reason for it to have gone to 75 years, let alone what it is now (95/120 or death of author + 70). I even think 50 is bit ridiculous. I could see 30 years or 20 years after death of the author whichever comes *first* as being reasonable (the death thing supposedly being so that dependent children aren't left in the lurch; but after 20 years they must be adults).\n\nThis won't change until enough people make a fuss about it.\n",

            "comment": "&gt;Have you ever tried meal planning and meal prep, only to become frustrated because your grocery list is too long and your meal planning activities seem to cost your family more than they save? There are so many great meal prep recipes out there that it can be easy to get overwhelmed and try to do too much at once, which can defeat the purpose of meal planning altogether.  \nWhy not try a simpler approach instead? In this cookbook, you will find 8 weeks' worth of meal plan menus, a basic shopping list of only eight ingredients, and a few grocery staples you likely already have on hand. An entire week with just eight ingredients in your shopping cart!",

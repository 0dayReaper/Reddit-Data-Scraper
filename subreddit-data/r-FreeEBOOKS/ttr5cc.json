This story was revealed to me by my mother-in-law, former associate professor at the Culinary Academy, and Director of the Culinary Research Center. She said there\u2019s a village in the Liquorland suburbs that specializes in producing meaty little boys, a place where the villagers don\u2019t give a second thought to the whole business. They sell their meaty little boys as if they were disposing of fattened little pigs, never troubled by gut-wrenching pain. I don\u2019t think my mother-in-law would lie about something like that. Since she\u2019d gain neither fame nor profit by lying to me, why lie?",

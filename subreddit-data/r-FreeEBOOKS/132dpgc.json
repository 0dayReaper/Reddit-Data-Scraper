            "comment": "&gt;Some people don\u2019t know what it is. Kawaii is the Japanese trend that means adorable, cute and lovable things. This recipe book is for new and old kawaii fans alike.  \nKawaii is used a great deal in the pop culture of Japan, especially among fans of manga and anime. The treats include bright colors, and happy shapes like bows and hearts. If something is so cute it\u2019s irresistible, it\u2019s definitely kawaii!  \nAlthough it\u2019s been popular in Japan for decades, the kawaii trend is moving around the world. From Hello Kitty (known as Kitty Chan in Japan) to My Neighbor Totoro and in general all kinds of cute animals, that\u2019s kawaii.",

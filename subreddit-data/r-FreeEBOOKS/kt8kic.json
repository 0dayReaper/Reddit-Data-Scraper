Our goal was to create a nicer and better UX than other apps which currently offer similar functionality. We have more than 60'000 ebooks on our app waiting to be discovered.\n\nAdditionally, using generative deep learning, we created new cover art for more than 30'000 ebooks.\n\nHope you guys like it and we would love to hear your feedback!\n\nAvailable for free on iOS and Android:\n\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dagda.buks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dagda.buks)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/buks-ebooks/id1546737092](https://apps.apple.com/app/buks-ebooks/id1546737092)\n\n[http://www.buksapp.com](http://www.buksapp.com/)",

Only thing that is a little unpracticle is that when I download a book, and I click on more option, I click on download epub and then, I need to select the app to open the file with each time. I think it'd be better if it was possible to register what app is being used to open the files and for it to be automatic.",

For some reason when i try to send other type of files to my kindle app it doesn't really work or maybe i just don't know how to do it ( i'm have an android btw ) . So i think having the option of a pdf format would be nice . But still the app is pretty nice so i wouldn't say it's a deal breaker for me to not use it .",

I'd happily throw a buck or two your way to remove them as I expect to use this app a lot.\n\n-when selecting to download a mobi or epub file, it prompts me to open an app to do so (on android, at least). I'd rather it just sends it to my downloads, the apps own directory, or gives me a file browser to choose where I save it so I don't have to open something else just to download it. \n\nLooking forward to see how this app develops!

If you're willing, I have some notes: \n\n* I turned off books in languages other than English in the settings, but they still show up on the main page, and also in \"All Categories\". Both the sections themselves show up, and the books in other languages. I'm totally fine ignoring them, but it's not all that clear what those settings actually do, because you toggle them off, and the thing you turned off doesn't seem to go away. \n* Is there any plan to enable your website with the same functionality as the app? I thought I was being clever by sharing the book page to my computer so I can download it, but the webpage just tells me to get the app.\n* I'd love to see a Calibre plugin paired with this to have a \"Send to Calibre\" button and automatic download! (For reasons my next point will elucidate).\n* This, for me, looks like it'll be a really elegant way to look at books I might want to get, and then an annoying struggle to actually get them. Unfortunately Kindles are unique in that they have a \"send to kindle\" email - my Kobo does not, and nor do most other varieties of eReaders.(Which is why my free content is managed on Calibre). It seems like when you say \"and send to your eReader (Kindle etc.) the \"etc.\" part is really tiny and awkward. \n\nThe closest I can seem to figure out how to get the books is to either:\n\n* Set my personal email as the Kindle email address, send books there, download the attachments, import manually into Calibre, and sync to my eReader. \n* Download the epub files to my phone, figure out some way from there to get them onto my computer (the easiest would probably be to use a USB cable, or just  put all the epubs on my SD card and move the card to my computer) and manually import into Calibre. \n* Figure out something with Calibre's content server and build my own solution. \n* Try to use the \"Send to Kindle\" email to send the file onto my Kindle account, hope they download on the desktop app, then retrieve the files, and shove them into Calibre. \n* Literally just look up the title of the book and download it directly from Project Gutenberg or wherever else and put it into Calibre. \n\nAll of these boil down to \"use your app to find books that I then have to specifically go away from your app to acquire\". That's not great if your goal is better UX. I can't imagine my use case and situation are all that unique.",

This should hopefully be solved in the next update.\n* I fully agree with your other point. Currently the app is only really made to make it easy to send ebooks to your Kindle. For everything else we say: Figure it out yourself, which is not optimal and doesn't solve the UX issue.We're definitely going to look into a way of making that experience better for you and other people who have a different e-reader. And we'll also look into Calibre and how that could sync / communicate with our app using Calibre's content server. Unfortunately I doubt we'll be able to pack everything into the next update (as we're only two people) but we'll do our best to have something very very soon!\n\nIf you have anything else you would like to share feel free to directly contact us via email at [feedback@buksapp.com](mailto:feedback@buksapp.com).

            "comment": "&gt;Skribbles and Bits: Large Font Edition: by David Kirkwood\n\n&gt;I am introducing myself through \u201cSkribbles and Bits\u201d. I suspect that I am a human from the planet Earth. These writings have been fun and therapeutic. This book is not for children, nor is it for adult children (the easily offended), or those of simple sensibilities. Most of the works, simply spilled out of my thinky thing out upon the pages below. I hope you derive at least as much pleasure from reading, as I did by getting this stuff out of my head. A collection of short poems, thoughts, ideas, even a few Haiku; I think. Enjoy!",

So effective in its narrative that some readers gave it a one-star rating when they found out it was fiction. Life is a Secret is a translation of my French Canadian novel Gras Dur which has garnered 4.8 stars on Amazon. Go figure. Did something get lost in translation? Please tell me in your review. It is Voltaire\u2019s Candide meets the Fugitive!",

            "comment": "but seriously, Hitler was not anywhere near billionaire status. IIRC from *The rise and fall of the Third Reich*, Hitler was poor most of his life. He never had any significant income until *Mein Kampf* started to sell a lot of copies in the late 20s and early 30s. *The rise and fall of the Third Reich* indicated that he failed to pay taxes on his earnings. Even when he was chancellor, he refused to pay taxes.\n\nDid he use his totalitarian power to increase his personal wealth? Yes. Was he a billionaire? If he was, only after he achieved absolute power. He was not wealthy before. I mean, if you have total power, why not become a billionaire lol?\n\nI am a social democrat (I am a capitalist that believes in having a strong welfare system and I am not a socialist) and I would never read the book that OP linked. The title of the post just seems pretentious. I agree that there are a lot of authoritarian actions taken by current politicians, but they are not on the same level as Hitler.\n\nThe Nazis did start off as socialists but soon became socialist in name only. I wouldn't necessarily call them hardcore capitalists. Was there a capitalistic aspect? Sure. But you can't really have a libertarian or unbridled sort of capitalism in a fascist or totalitarian society. How could you have the freedom to buy whatever you want if you can't even exist unless you fit the right profile?\n\nI would go on to say that even what we have in the united states isn't really capitalism. More like crony capitalism or some sort of oligopoly with the competition. The rich can basically bribe politicians with campaign contributions. The rich also held power in the Third Reich. Both of these examples (which the author seems to be comparing) are not really the result of hardcore capitalism, but rather capitalism within a system that allows for some degree of Authoritarian/totalitarian aspects (obviously the fascist third Reich is one extreme of this and the current US is much much much much lighter on this, so I wouldn't really compare the two just yet).\n\nIt seems that the premise of this book based on the post title (again, I have not read it and probably will not) is that fox news is dismissing socialism because they equate it to Nazism (national socialism). Therefore, if we show that nazis were not socialists, but rather capitalists, we can catch fox news in a gotcha moment, and then we can all adopt socialism to save America.\n\nThe problems of inequality facing America are not necessarily linked with capitalism or whatever economic system we would choose to have. Instead, it is a direct result of the rules of our country. When you have a democracy/republic that is designed to give everyone a vote, but then you allow rich and influential people to buy politicians with campaign contributions, you are undermining the core concepts of voting in a democracy.\n\nThe simple answer is to eliminate the ability of the rich to buy elections and officials with contributions. You don't need socialism to do this. You take the rich influence out of politics and you could potentially start to see leaders start making laws that favor most of the people again. You might see unionization rates increase again, fair wages, fair working conditions again, and better welfare programs emerge. \n\nYou can literally do all these things in a capitalist (more or less) society. Just look at the US before Reagan was president. Taxes on the rich were high compared to today, unions had a much higher participation rate, and inequality was not where it is today (I am not saying there should be no inequality, just that it shouldn't be as severe.)\n\nYes, I know that Orwell is a proponent of democratic socialism. But if you read his books, his main greivences are not with capitalism (or socialism as most americans ignorantly would say), instead it is with authoritarianism and totalitarian systems where people are dominated. \n\nSo we in the US are not to that point of totalitarianism that was achieved by the facsists in the third reich. Are there aspects of authoritarianism in Trump's actions? Absolutely. But instead of blowing up the system with capitalism as the boogieman in favor of socialism. Let's look to capitalist nations that don't have the same problems that we have to help derive a solution. I am talking about the various scandinavian countries. These are not socilist. They are capitalist countries that have a strong welfare system.\n\nWe could take some aspects that they have perfected and bring them here.\n\nIf you simply overthrow the system and make it socialist without doing much else to eliminate the potential for politicians and rich people to game the system, you will not solve the current problems. Let's look to *Homage to Catalonia* by george orwell. Prior to WW2, Orwell went to spain to report on the spanish civil war between the facists and socialist/marxists/anarchists. He soon joined the fight against the facists. He speaks of a short time where people lived in a socialist paradise. But this is short lived. The rich simply dressed like they were poor and bid their time until they could live luxuriously again.\n\nEDIT: Even if he was a billionare, I won't read this book. Just looks like a hit piece on the current republicans (who I hate). This book is basically the same coin as the likes of Ben Shapiro, just the other side of the coin. I hate reading stuff that has such an agressive and lopsided agenda. In looking into more details at this book, you can see all the liberal people that it is dedicated to. THis shows the bias (I agree with a lot of the people it is dedicated to and am even voting for biden (check my post history if you don't beleive me) but I refuse to read anything that is designed to massage any sort of confirmation bias). I think the initial premis that trump does authoritarian things is valid. Just think the tone and the agenda of this book go to far and will make the book less effective than it could have been.",

No one should argue that an owner shouldn't earn more. They took on the risk and deserve more. I take issue with the current level of inequality in the US. Unionization and collective bargaining have been undermined and have prevented wages from being as high as they were in previous generations. If unionization rates and real wages were on par to the pre-Reagan days, you would not have this anti-capitalistic attitude. \n\n&gt;I'm guessing you are looking at countries in the Nordic region, seeing they have a social economy and think that they are fairly redistributing wealth.\n\n&gt;What you're not looking at are these companies that have factories in developing countries who still pay pennies for labor and reap the benefits of that labor.\n\nSure. If you can outsource to another country that has a competitive advantage, you can make the products cheaper while improving the GDP of both countries. As a result, the production possibility curve of both countries is greatly expanded. The good for the consumers are cheaper, meaning they can buy more goods and have a higher quality of life, Assuming the profits are adequately distributed to the working class (like they are in the Nordic region, but not so in the US). Had unions for fast-food workers and retail workers developed as manufacturing left the US, income inequality would not have dropped off, and the increase of profits that have flowed into the US from globalism would have been shared more equitably.\n\nAs for the people making pennies in third world countries, this is more than they would be making otherwise. You should check out *Travels of a T-shirt in a global economy*. It covers this aspect of these developing countries. They have a path of development that starts off being cheap labor, but then they start to develop other specialties too. They eventually enact regulation and demand higher wages. Then the factories move and go somewhere cheaper. But these nations have their own specialties by then, so they still have more output and production than they would have otherwise.\n\n&gt;This is how multinational corporations work.\n\nAgreed, it is not perfect. I don't think it is as bad as you think it is. The wages are more than these poor people would have otherwise made. I do think that there are legit concerns over working conditions. Companies should work to improve those and often do when exposed. But I think the biggest problem is that these are designed to shelter money from taxes. Can these be fixed or improved? Probably, probably not.\n\nBut there are good aspects that you are probably overlooking and don't realize are there because of capitalism. Capitalism is the second-worst system. The worst is everything else. Capitalism should be regulated to prevent the legit critiques that Marx made in his writings. The solution is to regulate capitalism, not to replace it with socialism. I am not happy with the current \"capitalism\" in the US now. It should be improved. And that requires solutions that are more complex and realistic than Capitalism=bad, socialism=good...",

It also means low wages for the working class in the outsourced country because the only reason to outsource labor is to cut costs.\n\nThat means the difference doesn't go to the workers actually creating the product, it goes to the owners of the company and their shareholders.\n\nWhy didn't unions develop in the fast food, service, or retail industry? Could it possibly be large amounts of money accrued by the owners of large businesses using their wealth to ensure pro-worker or pro-labor laws were shredded and gutted? Have you worked at Wal-Mart where they tell you if anyone talks about a union, to disengage and immediately go tell the manager?\n\nThese countries are still developing because they've been ravaged by colonialism, having the wealth and resources extracted from them by 1st) Settler-colonial countries and 2nd) multi-national corporations. Go see what happened to Mossadegh when he tried to nationalize Iran's oil fields, Salvador Allende when he nationalized the copper mines in Chile, or Jakarta under the rule of Suharto.\n\nIt wasn't because they just aren't teched up enough, it's because they've never had control over their own resources.\n\nYou don't overturn this system with an amendment about keeping money out of politics. There is so much accrued *global* wealth that taking it out of their hands is the only way to ensure we have a future of equity.\n\nAnd I don't mean wealth in the terms of how much money they make each year. I mean ownership over collective resources we all depend on. I mean in the ownership of the means to produce those resources into goods that we all depend on; Energy, Food, Water, Housing, Healthcare, Education, etc.\n\nThere aren't tweaks to the system that need to be made. If after 400 years the system is still this unequal, it's time to abandon it and move on. We moved on from feudalism and mercantilism.

There's a lot more about that from German historians in German.\n\nIn retrospect we look at Hitler as this almost superhuman villain. But that's only after we saw how many people he killed. Before the Holocaust, he was very much a Trump-like figure.\n\nTrump is Hitler before the Holocaust. Things are gonna get much uglier in November.

In Germany the concept of nationalism is shunned for a very good reason. See World War 2. \n\n**Nationalism is tribalism. And tribalism always, always leads to war.** \n\nTribalism is simply the idea of \"us vs them\" which always leads to \"we are better than them\" and \"our needs are more important than theirs, because we are more important than them.\"\n\nThat always, always leads to war, because you think your own interests supersede those of other countries. \n\nAnd when the people in the other country believe the same thing about themselves, as all nationalists do, it inevitably leads to conflict.\n\nThe first thing that happened when Britain announced they'd leave the EU was than Spain and Britain got into a conflict over Gibraltar. As soon as it was no longer \"we\" but those two countries suddenly saw each other as \"the other\" they sent warships to Gibraltar and almost fired on each other.\n\nThat's why people who proudly proclaim to be nationalists are seen as ignorant morons by those of us who haven't forgotten history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Literally no tactic used in American politics today is new, same with the rest of the world.\n\nRepublicans today are literally copying their policies from Nazi Germany. \"America first\" is just an English translation of \"Deutschland, Deutschland ueber alles.\"\n\nIt's exactly the kind of tribal thinking that always leads to war. See above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Oh, yeah, so the endless demonization of Republicans by the Democrats is just a giant misunderstanding?\n\nHere's the difference:\n\nWhen Democrats say Trump is corrupt, it's actually true. It's a fact-based statement about a criminal.\n\nWhen Republicans say Hillary is an actual demon from hell who smells like sulphur and operates a childporn ring from the basement of a pizza parlor, that is a lie. A propaganda lie. A propaganda lie to demonize \"the other.\"\n\nSee the difference?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;the Democrats want the Republicans erased.\n\nThat right there is one of those propaganda lies I just mentioned.\n\nHitler told his brainwashed minions that Jews want to destroy Germany and the white German race, and replace them with mongrels.\n\nTrump told his brainwashed minions that Democrats want to destroy America and the white American race, and replace them with mongrels.\n\nIt's literally the exact same lie.\n\nAnd you just repeated that lie to me.\n\nAnd that is exactly how Republicans brainwash you with lies.\n\nTrump literally tweeted that only a dead Democrat is a good Democrat.\n\nAnd yet, here you are, claiming that it was the Democrats who said this about Republicans, not the other way around.",

It's a well documented historical fact that Hitler lied pretty much every time he opened his mouth.\n\nHe was very good at manipulating people with his lies. He was proud of it. He used lies as a political tool. As a weapon.\n\nHe even wrote about how easy it is to manipulate people with lies in his book Mein Kampf.\n\nOne of his lies was the name of his party. The Nazis were called National Socialist, because socialism was a good thing, a positive thing, that working class people vote for, to improve their lives.\n\nHitler used the name National Socialist to trick uninformed people into voting for him, and voting against their own best interests.\n\nHe promised them all sorts of things that would improve the lives of the working class, but in reality he and his party did the exact opposite: they plundered the working class and shoveled all that money into the pockets of the super rich 1%.\n\nMany Americans falsely believe that the Nazis were somehow socialist, because it's in the name. They were not. In fact they were hardcore predatory capitalists, just like the US and Great Britain.\n\nThe Nazis did not believe in \"the people should own the means of production.\" They believed in exactly the opposite: they took things that were owned by the public, and gave it to billionaires. Just like in the US today.\n\n**The Nazis literally invented privatization**. In fact, the word privatization didn't even exist before the Nazis. The English word \"privatization\" was invented to describe what the Nazis were doing.\n\n**The Roots of Privatization**\n\n[https://daily.jstor.org/the-roots-of-privatization/](https://daily.jstor.org/the-roots-of-privatization/)\n\n&gt;\u201cPrivatization\u201d was coined in English descriptions of the German experience in the mid-1930s. In the early twentieth century, many European economies featured state ownership of vital sectors. *Reprivatisierung*, or re-privatization, marked the Nazi regime\u2019s efforts to de-nationalize sectors of the German economy. As Bel notes, **\u201cGerman privatization of the 1930s was intended to benefit the wealthiest sectors and enhance the economic position and political support of the elite.\u201d**",

Unless the professor requires the class to buy his/her book that he or she authored, the savings over time of a couple thousand dollars is a huge benefit. I know several students who've done this while working part-time/full-time and it really helped them in terms of budgeting. ",

The information is the same, and you only have to pay money if you want a paper copy of the book. I was told that there was a movement among instructors of introductory college courses to move to less expensive textbook options, which the OpenStax format does. Since the content is written by instructors, it will more often conform to actual curricula as well (although my statements can be considered biased due to personal experience and local post-secondary environment).",

    "postText": "Hi everyone!! In celebration of the first book being released, it will be free until the 16th June 2023. The synopsis is below:\n\nVampires fill the world of fiction, with many books and movies attempting to depict the nightwalking creatures. This was the world that encapsulated Freya MacKenzie, yet she never believed they existed in real life. That was until one killed her mother and she was kidnapped.\n\nFreya is thrown into a new world as she is taken to the vampire compound, with murderous creatures surrounding her. Her unusual ability to resist compulsion makes her a unique test subject for the vampires, causing Freya\u2019s world to become a living nightmare. Attacks, experiments, and fear fill Freya\u2019s new life with the vampires. Without any help from the outside world, Freya is left to rely on her unlikely accomplices - the two vampires that kidnapped her. Can Freya escape the compound and go back to her normal life?\n\nUK Link- https://amzn.eu/d/2Hh6MZ3\n\nUS Link- https://www.amazon.com/Eternal-Thirst-J-McDonald-ebook/dp/B0C72PD2FB/ref=mp_s_a_1_13?crid=K2LPL6UVPDTM&amp;keywords=eternal+thirst&amp;qid=1686072437&amp;rnid=2941120011&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=eternal+thirst%2Caps%2C247&amp;sr=1-13",

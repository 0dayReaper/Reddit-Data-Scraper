It\u2019s also very detailed on military technology from a very remote and specific point in time. This kind of makes it somewhat less of a page turner as you must wade through some pretty in-depth discussions on merits of chariots and archers. That\u2019s not to say that knowing how I would arrange my Calvary when on swampy lower ground is not valuable information.  It\u2019s just the kind of thing that doesn\u2019t come up everyday, if you appreciate my meaning.",

Nevertheless I can't help but feel that Art of War became this famous thing thanks to some genius in a publishing company that decided to market it to pretentious junior businessmen who got their minds blown by groundbreaking ideas such as \"Do the unexpected\" and \"Keep your enemies on their toes\".",

Some English editions include a companion commentary by Bernard Brodie, which is very helpful. There's also a nice English, very heavily abridged, version called *War, Politics, and Power* that distills most of the basics in a more accessible way.\n\nFor background, Von Clausewitz was an officer in the Prussian military during the Napoleonic Wars. He was instrumental in the Prussian turn that led to Napoleon's collapse in Russia. As was said above, On War was more of a perpetually modified notebook on the subject. Book 1 was recently updated before he died, and is the most poignant and powerful of the work. Personally, I think anyone who lives in a democracy where they may cast a vote for candidates who have the power to wage war should be familiar with Book 1.\n\n Von Clausewitz was a massive influence on the German military leading into the World Wars, and I've read a few arguments that the Japanese may have had an interest in him as well. He wasn't \"discovered\" in the US into the Cold War, but has been very influential in the US military. The US Army War college has a nice lecture on him available on Youtube.",

It makes me feel like I'm reading and accompanying (like part of his subconscious) the author as he was writing/conceptualizing the book. It sort of helps you understand his true intentions and make some self-reflection of your own.\n\nYou can google it and a lot of sources will appear.

I really feel that the books balance out each other. \n\nMy professor in college once told our class that  Confucius and Lao Tzu can be considered as contemporaries of each other since Confucius focused more on keeping with the traditions and stability while Lao Tzu was detaching one's self with his personal obsession with the material world and on finding the Way. We only read the excerpts of the Analects and the Tao Te Ching, and afer reading the Art of War, I've come to want to read other Chinese philosophers' works more.\n\nThank you so much in advance!",

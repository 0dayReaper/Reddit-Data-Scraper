            "comment": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen a citizen is murdered by the secret police, a cover-up is required. This cover-up grows and morphs, and touches everyone on the way to the very top of the People\u2019s Republic and the Ministry of State Security.\n\nThe Secret Policemen tells the story of the corrupt Police Inspector, the violent Smoking Man, and the trans sex worker Karla. The Inspector and the Smoking Man will do anything to avoid a one way trip to the ominous sounding Farm, and Karla is just trying to stay out of everything.\n\nThe Secret Policemen is story full of interesting characters, absurdity, darkness, betrayal, and the unfortunate people of the People's Republic.\n\nThe Secret Policemen will make you laugh and cry - and will shock and surprise you.\n\nThe Secret Policemen is a wickedly transgressive dark comedy.\n\nThis is the first book of a duology that charts to life and tribulations of Karla.",

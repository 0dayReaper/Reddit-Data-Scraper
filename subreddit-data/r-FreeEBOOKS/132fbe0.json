            "comment": "&gt;Thai cuisine has a character all its own. It is easily distinguishable from Chinese and other Asian cuisines. Thai cooking balances sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and spicy in its own unique way. This recipe book will help you prepare your favorite recipes, in your home. Most are easy to make without losing that takeout feel. Cooking at home may take more work than ordering out, but it\u2019s always healthier and more fun. Bring the delicate flavors of Thailand food to your kitchen. This book will show exactly how. You will learn how to prepare Thai food like takeout restaurants do and make you an expert at handling Thai ingredients and blending the flavors that make Thailand recognized worldwide for its excellent cuisine.",

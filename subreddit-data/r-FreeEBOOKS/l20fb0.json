The vatican was one of the few areas where scholars and historians could record history in relative safety during that time period. Almost all the written history in western Europe at the time was taken to the vatican to be recorded.\n\nSimply put, the vatican saw itself as the \"protector of history\" during the dark ages, especially after the destruction of the library of Alexandria. The only relative comparison at the time would be the library of Baghdad. Think of these great libraries as modern universities, except there were only a few in the entire world.\n\nEdit: Also to those who are claiming that it should've been stored in the library of Baghdad, the city and library got sacked and destroyed by the Mongols. So that history would have been lost were it kept in Baghdad.",

Why would they **need** to explain how these animals survived the flood when God could have just created them again? \n\nI would understand if this was a single explanation from a single culture, but this is a world wide phenomenon. So the Gods of cultures and people all over the world decided to flood the earth, save the animals, and create a new world? why not just flood the earth and create humans and animals again?\n\n&gt; Naturally. Birds can fly, ergo see further, and don\u2019t need to be only the land to live.\n\nSame as my statement above, why couldn't God just let the protagonist know that the flood  is over? why do so many faiths rely on a bird to figure out if the flood is finished?\n\nThere is a story being told here, and this story is a world wide event. Genesis itself is eerily similar to creation myths of eastern religions and native American religions. To try and explain away tens of thousands of years of history based on what you know from a couple decades of living is incredibly arrogant. The life you live today is *because* of the ancestors that came before you, they lived through rougher, harder, and darker times than we can ever imagine. I wouldn't underestimate their intelligence or wisdom.",

How did aquatic life cope with the sudden change in salinity of the water? Plus plenty of other questions. \n\nBut a flood that was large enough that it *felt* like the whole world to the people writing down the story? Sure. Or an oral tradition that eventually morphs into a story of the whole world when the first iterations of it were just of a great flood? Also completely plausible. People making up a story to explain why they sometimes find old shells far away from the ocean? I\u2019ll buy that. Entire world actually covered in liquid water that has since disappeared? No.",

            "comment": "There's literially nothing original in the Bible period.\n\nIt's all just a copy of more successful religions of their time.  It's like a corporation that was like how can we have that level of success.....copy everyone else!!\n\n\nEDIT:\nIf you're downvoting just pick up a history book or take a theology class.\n\nLiterially take any Holiday.\n\nChristmas is German pagan worship of nature.  What do you think the tree is for?  You thought Jesus came back as a tree?\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/how-christmas-in-the-us-has-evolved-from-its-german-roots/2015/12/16/c904f84e-a2b6-11e5-9c4e-be37f66848bb_story.html\n\nEaster is the worship of Eostre.  You thought Jesus shat eggs?\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-15/the-origins-of-easter-from-pagan-roots-to-chocolate-eggs/8440134\n\nMost of everything about Jesus is just Zoroastrianism and greek gods.\n\nMost of the bible is a worship of astrology (I'm using the anceint word not the modern).  That's why there's so many references to numbers, dates, times, sun, stars, ect,. Which was huge back before this even existed.\n\nOn and on.\n\nhttp://www4.westminster.edu/staff/brennie/Rennie%25202007%2520CSSR.36.1.3-7.pdf\n\nDon't be afraid to pick up a book. \n\nhttps://www.express.co.uk/news/science/774752/JESUS-prior-religions-CONTROL-the-people-roman\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_comparative_mythology\n\nUnfortunately it's hard to find more information without turning to text books since Christians have spent millions of dollars to obscure this fact.  As you will see if you try to google this topic.\n\nIt's literially just copying other things and mixing it in with what they wanted.  As a lovely form of control.  Mostly slave control at least during Roman times.  That's why there's so many references to accepting suffering as a clensing process for the after life.\n\nThis is why Catholics take the bible with a pinch of salt and refer to the text as a collection of parables.\n\nIn the US puritans and evangelicals have interpreted the text as 100% true as if it were written by God himself.  Except it's not these are literially a collection of chosen books from hundreds of possible choices.  Chosen by the people, written by people, obscured to whatever they feel like meaning by people.\n\nNot all Christians approach the book as an ordained object.",

Aside from a few smaller pieces (aka Gilgamesh likely existed or something along those lines) we will most likely not be able to tell much about how factual the storytelling in Gilgamesh is.",

Questions that Eygptologists don't like are \"if they had no high technology, then how did they know about all the planets and their orbits?\". You will find many ancient cultures have built them throughout history. You can follow the naming of planets and descriptions all the way back to the Sumerian Epic of Creation. The information is there, it's up to you, read, don't read. But most people won't, they will just retort with some BS, thinking that they are right. That's fine.",

I certainly dont see a telescope as being very possible.  They had glass but incredibly primitive glass and therefore no way to make either lenses or mirrors that could be used for the purpose.

Unless they figure out plastic, which they obviously did not, even the most advanced technology made from wood, metal, cloth, leather or even ceramics and glass would have been obliterated by entropy in way less than 4500 years.  Just look at what happens to a old car left in a field for 80 years.  Its largely disintegrated.  In 300 years there would likely only be glass left and even that would have been so broken pitted and polished by the elements as to be largely unrecognizable.  I'm not saying they had advanced technology but it seems like it is very possible that they could have.",

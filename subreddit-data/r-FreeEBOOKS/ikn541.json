I do think these should be taught , specifically in high school, and follow up advanced course in college as well. \n\nI mean math and science are important, but learning how to survive in the real world as an independent person, know how to live and take care of oneself decently, is underrated. \n\nMany of us were pushed to go out when we are not given enough information on how vast a difference is when it comes to real life... Although learning stuff the hard way is effective, it leaves me with bad memories.",

Renters insurance is designed to protect your belongings, not the property.  \n\nSmoke alarms and fire sprinklers are great, but water and smoke can cause just as much destruction as fire. \n\nYou are right, they do make their money denying claims. But you can protect against that by documenting the condition and value of your belongings before any damage occurs. Renters insurance is a lot cheaper than replacing everything you own.",

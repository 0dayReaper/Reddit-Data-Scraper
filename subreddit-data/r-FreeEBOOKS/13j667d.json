            "comment": "As always, if you pick up the book and love it, we're always happy to receive reader reviews!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Award-winning authors Scott L. Mingus Sr. and Eric J. Wittenberg are back with the second and final installment of \u201cIf We Are Striking for Pennsylvania\u201d: The Army of Northern Virginia\u2019s and Army of the Potomac\u2019s March to Gettysburg. This compelling and bestselling study is the first to fully integrate the military, political, social, economic, and civilian perspectives with rank-and-file accounts from the soldiers of both armies during the inexorably march north toward their mutual destinies at Gettysburg.\r  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Untold numbers of reports, editorials, news articles, letters, and diaries describe the passage of the long martial columns, the thunderous galloping of hooves, and the looting, fighting, suffering, and dying. Mingus and Wittenberg mined hundreds of primary accounts, newspapers, and other sources to produce this powerful and gripping saga. As careful readers will quickly discern, other studies of the runup to Gettysburg gloss over most of this material. It is simply impossible to fully grasp and understand the campaign without a firm appreciation of what the armies and the civilians did during the days leading up to the fateful meeting at the small crossroads town in Adams County, Pennsylvania.\r\n\n# Praise for \"If We Are Striking...\"\n\n\u201cA **decidedly fresh** account of the Gettysburg Campaign... **Even veteran Gettysburg readers will find much that is new** in this well-written and thoroughly researched work.\u201d\r \u2014 Jeffrey Wm Hunt, author of the award-winning *Meade and Lee After Gettysburg*\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAnother **outstanding collaboration** by award-winning Gettysburg authors Scott Mingus and Eric Wittenberg. The study is **well researched**, effectively presented, and endlessly interesting.\u201d\r \u2014 Joseph L. Owen, award-winning author of *A Fine Introduction to Battle* and co-author of, *Unceasing Fury*\r  \n\r  \n\u201c...an **insightful new exploration** of the first three weeks of that most iconic of all civil war events: Gettysburg. Here is a story that is **both a great read and a deeply researched dive** into the fateful events of late June 1863.\u201d\r \u2014 Dave Powell, award-winning author of *The Chickamauga Campaign* trilogy",

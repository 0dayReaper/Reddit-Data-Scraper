I only know about some details due to researching cancer when my sister was diagnosed.\n\nYou really should talk to your *oncologist* about your fears, and the chances that your children could inherit any cancer genes from you.\n\nI'd like to leave you with this [article](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/inherited-cancer-genes-and-increased-cancer-risk/family-history-and-inherited-cancer-genes#How%20common%20are%20cancers%20caused%20by%20inherited%20faulty%20genes?) from *Cancer Research UK* about cancer genes, and again urge you to talk to your *oncologist*.\n\nI hope that article helps you, and that you recover from your cancer.

There are also professional Ethics counselors/advisors that you should be able to access.  The problem with Social Media is that you don\u2019t really know who you\u2019re getting advise from.  I am a Registered Nurse with &gt;40 years in Critical Care Medicine &amp; Surgery.  I have taken care of MANY cancer patients &amp; work with Oncologists of many different types to help care for their patients.  I can tell you that they do not know what causes all cancers.  There are alterations in genes, but what causes those alterations - they don\u2019t know for sure. Just because a parent or a relative has a cancer, doesn\u2019t mean that all children will have expressions of that cancer.  Many People carry the genes for cancers, &amp; never have the expression of that gene, or later in life have the cancer show up.  Cancer is not a good thing, but, can you or should you deny the loving &amp; fulfilling life to someone, even if shorter than hoped for, because they inherit a gene, or have a mutation of a gene?  My advise is to do what\u2019s in your heart to do.  Love &amp; caring for each other is what defines us as humans &amp; whether we\u2019ll have fulfilling lives.  The illness &amp; even death of other people, whether family, friends or strangers, also has a great impact on the people they interact with.  In caring for people who die, I have felt intense good feelings that I have been able to help them in some way, even small ways, to provide some happiness or joy, or alleviate their pain or sorrow, or to \u2018just be there\u2019 with them when they felt alone or abandoned.  The sadness, loss or fulfillment &amp; blessing of a sick person\u2019s life isn\u2019t theirs alone- their life affects so many others also.  Cancer &amp; all Illnesses are a shared experience between people- family, friends &amp; community.  Invite others into your life, there are many people who welcome &amp; need that invitation.  I have known many people who have been adopted or that have adopted other children &amp; families - &amp; their lives are richer &amp; stronger through the experience of adoption.  I understand also, people who decide not to pass their genes onto offspring, for whatever reasons they choose to - that is each persons individual decision to make.  I have cared for, &amp; known many people who were treated for a cancer, were \u2018cured\u2019 &amp; went on to live a long life &amp; die of other causes.  I\u2019ve known people who got 20 more years or so to live after treatment.  It\u2019s not about the length of a persons life that we offer our help &amp; treatment for them, not is it up to us healthcare providers to make judgements about the quality of their lives either.  Our goals are to alleviate suffering &amp; to help our patients to fulfill their dreams - to develop &amp; live living lives- not to just or only live longer lives.  If you like to read, may I suggest a great book about cancer?  It is \u2018The Emperor of All Maladies\u2019 by Siddhartha Mukherje.  It won many prizes.  It is an easy read, though long &amp; involved.  I have gifted it to many people who have thanked me.  It is factual about cancer &amp; includes the history &amp; future (up to 2010) of cancer research.  I think it can help you make your decisions about your future.  Good luck &amp; God bless you!  \u2764\ufe0f",

I expect humankind to eventually conquer natural selection when gene manipulation becomes commonplace and we can just turn off high risk genes at conception. So in the big picture there is no need to think that we would need another black death to filter the gene pool.\n\nBut we are not yet there so it's really about weighing the risk of how deadly diseases you would pass on and how much you want kids. High cancer risk is pretty common trait with people. Doesn't mean your kid would get it.",

(This book is \\*about\\* 1665 but was written and published in the 1720s. Super modern and influential technique of writing a historical novel \"through the eyes\" of one experiencing the events. He's great. If you like this, all of his novels (including the crazy supernatural ones) are available for free.",

Yes - it\u2019s a bleak story.\n\nMaybe spoilers! ::\n\nI think you can read it as a good disaster novel. \nBut I think it\u2019s pretty obviously a metaphor &amp; vehicle to talk about morality: in the book awful things happen without accountability- the perpetrators can\u2019t be seen (that blindness disease) &amp; so things get brutal in a quarantined group of blindness-sufferers. In the book it just takes one person to be able to see (metaphorically &amp; physically) to make a difference. It takes the character love &amp; courage but it provides something positive. \n\nNone of the characters are named- these surface personal details just aren\u2019t important. It\u2019s a strange style, but after a few pages you get used to it. \n\nIf you enjoy this, it reminds me of the equally brilliant/dismal \u2018the year or the goat\u2019: Haiti has had a very depressing history. And this book is afaik quite an accurate telling. Not a disease-plague but a political one you might say..",

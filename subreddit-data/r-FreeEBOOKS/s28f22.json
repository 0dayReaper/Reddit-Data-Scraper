He kept a daily diary for 10 years and chronicled his first-hand account of events like the Plague and the Great Fire of London. It's the most important first-hand account we have of life at the time.",

This website [https://www.pepysdiary.com/](https://www.pepysdiary.com/) posts a diary entry a day and it is possible to get it sent to your email. Be sure to check out the annotated notes as it is quite similar to reddit comments.\n\nJohn Evelyn was another person keeping a diary at the same time. They were friends. Pepys diary is famous because he is the primary source of Royal goings on.\n\nEdit 1: Making sentences is hard. I'm no Pepys.",

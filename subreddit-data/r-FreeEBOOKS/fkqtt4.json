That's ultimately the problem with textbooks--they \\*are\\* a failed business. They are very niche in very specialized subjects in a very flooded market. (\"American Approaches to Sports Ethics\" attracts fewer buyers than a Harlequin novel but costs way, way, more to produce) But it's important that they stay current and up-to-date for students. I agree students shouldn't have to be wrung dry over textbooks, OR tuition. (I think both should be subsidized/covered for everybody) \n\nBut the publishing companies are not nefarious moustache twirlers in all this. At least not entirely.  They're struggling to survive, and if they went away, who would do that work of compiling and creating those works? Many professors do write their own books, sure, but many don't, and if we did rely on professors to DIY their own textbooks...welp. The quality would vary wildly, for one, and for another, that's not something everyone can do. I know paying a lot for textbook sucks ass and I didn't buy all my textbooks/got from the library/bought previous editions. It reminds me of newspapers. A sputtering, failed, business. Another I think is very necessary. But there's a good reason textbooks aren't free. Even though they should be. Anyway, stay healthy (and I mean that. hope the transition to online classes is seamless if you're in school)",

Tbh I just about upvoted everything you AND the other people replying to you said. It\u2019s not a competition with a single yes/no solution lol...just a conversation more people should be having right now.\n\nI know it\u2019s not practical or possible for many courses/people, but I went through uni with mostly second hand textbooks (mostly the current edition too!) and could probably sell most of them for the exact same price after (but didn\u2019t because I wanted to keep many of them). None of my lecturers used a book they wrote themselves. Many used and handed out their own supplementary materials for free. I had one professor though, who tried to change textbooks after the semester had started and almost everyone already had their textbook ready\ud83d\ude02We ended up using the one we all paid for a tiny little bit, and using the other one as an ebook off the uni library. I personally prefer paperback though...\n\nBut anyway...textbooks ARE niche products. I mean, primary school textbooks can be extremely cheap in China partly because there is one standard edition that EVERYONE needs and so they can be mass-produced, and the content isn\u2019t as niche or dense or technical and as quick to be outdated as many university level books are, eh?",

Or for the 20th edition of an intro psych book when you can get the 18th edition for ten bucks. But the books are expensive to make, between permissions and rights and paying for content--e-books are usually not much cheaper, if at all.\n\n The people involved need to be paid (and academic publishing doesn't pay much at all). Nobody wants to pay--which again, I get it. But the publishing industry is doing what it can to sustain itself in the face of piracy and used books. I had many courses where all we did was read the textbook. So why shouldn't the people who make the books be able to survive off their labour? Like I mentioned I think school AND textbooks should be covered for everybody. But in the meantime, publishers aren't racketeers. (So many academic publishers are giving their stuff away for free to students during COVID-19) They're trying to keep the lights on so they can keep doing their (important) work. I accept my downvotes but appreciate you mentioning that this is a complicated issue. :)",

We apologise for the inconvenience caused and are working to address these concerns to reinstate free access as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nGuess we\u2019ll just have to keep an eye out for when they re-open!",

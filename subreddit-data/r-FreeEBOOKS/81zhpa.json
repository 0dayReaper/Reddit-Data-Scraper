The reason why its so easy to travel as an american is because our dollar carries further in poorer nations. But you're out here talking about trustifarians (a term usually used for people with a fat trust fund they didn't earn) which made me think you were disillusioned with the avg american being able to travel which just *isn't true*. Then you pull this holier than thou \"you think you aren't rich but you are\" well yeah, duh. Which is why I'm working in the U.S. and then using my savings to travel the world until it runs out. ",

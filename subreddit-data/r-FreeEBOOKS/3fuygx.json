Only exception are damaged books. You can't even have coupons or sales. When you signed up for Amazon prime you got a voucher for a few Euros and they where sued (and recently lost) because you could use the voucher on their books. When i wanted to read \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" I checked the prices and the collectors box (in English) cost over a 70\u20ac in Germany and the equivalent of 35\u20ac on Amazon UK. The German translation is even worse because they split the book and charge \"double\" (same price for one book but the book is only half as long) which brought the price up to something like 120\u20ac. I ordered 35\u20ac worth of books (which got me the first two) at a local book store and pirated the rest as ebooks. Yes, pirating is a big nono but I was just so sick of it at the time.",

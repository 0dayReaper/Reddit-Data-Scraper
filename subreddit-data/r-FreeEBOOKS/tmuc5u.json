And maybe question why cathedrals are built the way they are instead of just assuming they\u2019re wrong to be built the way they are because of preconceived notions of greed or whatever, which by the way, are totally accurate downsides to the Catholic Church in how it\u2019s run as it\u2019s run by fallen men and always will be, but the beauty and richness of cathedrals is as biblical as a practice can be. The garden of Eden was the first sanctuary (filled with virtually everything humans find valuable to make it a special place where Gods presence was know ) and every following sanctuary was built to emulate it. A sanctuary built without this concept in mind is not following the biblical example God began and commanded when it came to the temples, tabernacle, etc, every place He commanded us to build as a holy sanctuary.",

To be more clear, the garden of Eden was a sort of prototype of a sanctuary, with the themes in play that were later repeated in Gods commandments for future sanctuaries, each growing closer and closer to the ideal, which is Heaven, the ultimate end of all incomplete goods in their perfection. The whole of scripture operates in this prototype\u2014&gt; fulfillment format, Jesus explains and demonstrates it over and over.",

                            "comment": "Correct. Well, not exactly instructs directly- it leaves many clues that it shouldn't be taken literal. One major clue being Jesus only spoke in parables. So if you go back and then re-read everything as if it were all parables it makes much more sense. The Book no longer becomes a history book of random people, but a book about your life and your mind. Some other hints I can recall are: Paul writes in Galatians 4:24 in regard to Abraham and Sarah he states, \"In which things are an allegory\". Also, in 2 Corinthians he writes \"Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.\" Basically meaning, if you take this stuff literally, and not spiritually, then it could result in violence (Crusade, Holy Wars etc).",

No publisher is going to say, \"You can only loan out this physical book X amt of times and only that amount before you have to buy a new license.\"\n\nI personally don't think it should be different just because the book is digital. My take on it is, it's a LIBRARY and they should be allowed to loan out the book to as many people who are interested. You only get the book for a short amount of time anyway and you have to go on a wait list before you can rent it again (for the most part, or at least that's how it works at my local library). The library should not have to pay again and again and again. This subscription model BS prices out poor people and I'm afraid that once we lock down on libraries having to pay for digital licenses like a subscription model that we lose the purpose of the public library altogether. \n\nThat's my personal belief but I'm also poor AF rn and when I wasn't poor I was more than willing to pay for my fair share of books instead of renting.",

But those licenses expire after like 2 years or something like that. So they have to purchase the license again. Also it limits the amount of check outs, versus letting libraries buy a digital copy of a book that can then be distributed and loaned.",

It's not an unlimited number of loans or copies; if they own five physical copies then they only loan out five copies at a time and someone has to return one of the copies before someone else can borrow it. That's the current system (called \"Controlled Digital Lending\").\n\n In my opinion this program is not the same as what you are describing because the library is not creating any additional copies or violating any quantity limits imposed by the publisher. The library is only lending out the books that they have paid for, just in a different format.",

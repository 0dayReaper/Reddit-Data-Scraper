How is any of that first part relevant to working out? Also why bash on people? If anything, the gym is the sacred place where I get my good vibes. No hating on others please \u2014 inside or outside the gym. And fyi gay dudes can be absolute beasts and straight dudes can be weak. But they\u2019re all trying to improve themselves regardless. Why diss on people? Smh",

You shouldn\u2019t be worried if you look good - by the end of your session it should be necessary to take a shower.",

Like, focus on yourself, who cares what other people are doing or presenting? You're there to workout and work on your fitness, why does it matter that other people are behaving this way? It's totally and utterly irrelevant. Smells like BS, sorry.....",

            "comment": "At the end of his life and suffering from terminal throat cancer, Ulysses S. Grant was too weak to walk but still committed to writing 25 - 50 pages a day for his memoirs.\n\nThe first printing of 350,000 copies were sold by 10,000 traveling salesmen, many of whom were former Union soldiers and wore their old uniforms.\n\nThe _Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant_ has been highly regarded by the general public, military historians, and literary circles. Mark Twain (the famous writer and Grant's publisher) said:\n\n\"I had been comparing the memoirs with Caesar's _Commentaries_. \u2026I was able to say in all sincerity, that the same high merits distinguished both books\u2014clarity of statement, directness, simplicity, unpretentiousness, manifest truthfulness, fairness and justice toward friend and foe alike, soldierly candor and frankness, and soldierly avoidance of flowery speech. I placed the two books side by side upon the same high level, and I still think that they belonged there.\"\n\nGrant's memoirs start: \"My family is American, and has been for generations, in all its branches, direct and collateral.\"\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to /r/26reads for the latest free books!

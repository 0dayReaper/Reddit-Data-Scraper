I got a good grade, but maybe I need to reread it and research the rest cure.",

From Wikipedia:\n\n&gt;Gilman claimed that many years later she learned that Mitchell had changed his treatment methods, but literary historian Julie Bates Dock has discredited this. Mitchell continued his methods, and as late as 1908 \u2013 16 years after \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" was published \u2013 was interested in creating entire hospitals devoted to the \"rest cure\" so that his treatments would be more widely accessible.\n\nWhat is your source on Mitchell changing his mind?",

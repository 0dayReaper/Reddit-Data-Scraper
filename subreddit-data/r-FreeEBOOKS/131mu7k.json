If you have an easy way for me to report them, I\u2019d be willing to help a little. I\u2019m reading on my kindle if that matters. \n\nPLEASE whatever you do, keep writing. This is great stuff!!! You could be the next Stephen King or GRR Martin. \n\nAlso, could you finish some stuff for Patrick Rothfuss while you\u2019re at it? LoL",

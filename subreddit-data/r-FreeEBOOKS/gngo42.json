A big part of what I wanted to talk about with these poems is that even when we think we've lost our friends completely (or ourselves in the case of addicts), that flame is still in there. Often times addicts, especially the ones who die still active in addiction, are remembered as if the last few years of their life were worthless. I think this is why the opioid epidemic, which has killed far more Americans than any war, is really hardly talked about in our society. The dead are dehumanized in many ways.\n\nBut imo, even in addiction, addicts have a rich inner life that deserves to be talked about. These are real people dying.\n\nI hope you find some solace in the book, and I'm sorry to hear about your friend.",

It takes enormous strength to pull yourself out of an abusive relationship at all, let alone one with addiction involved. To be able to do that and be there for your little girl is so powerful. Kids growing up around dope is something that shouldn't have to happen, and you've saved her from that. You deserve the pride you carry with your sobriety. I wish you only the best!",

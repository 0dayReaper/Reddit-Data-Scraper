Stowe, an abolitionist, wrote it to try to depict the cruel realities of slavery; her book became the best selling novel of the entire 19th century, and is said to have laid the groundwork for the US Civil War.",

                    "comment": "It's kind of complicated. Basically in order to portray Uncle Tom as the most virtuous possible slave, he is also very submissive to his slave masters throughout the book. The point was to show that slavery was cruel even to someone who was the \"ideal\" slave, not just as a hard worker but as a virtuous individual. Though he does help some other slaves escape, he himself chooses not to attempt escape, and in the climax of the book as he is being beaten to death by some overseers he forgives them as he dies, which causes the two men to reevaluate themselves and become good Christians. The book is *very* religious and relies on those themes of forgiveness, however now that we are even further from slavery and the evils are more obvious, people have reevaluated the character as being so excessively submissive to his station as a slave as to be a disservice to African American identity and the reality of slavery that was faced by so many. People today, especially people in left leaning, pro-black spaces would prefer to see more direct retribution if those who have done wrong and real systemic change, so the message of Uncle Tom's Cabin falls flat to a modern audience.",

                            "comment": "In relation to your commentary, I am reminded of a letter in the Bible written by the Apostle Paul to his brother in Christ, Philemon. Philemon had a slave named Onesimus who owed him a debt. The letter doesn't say what that debt was, but Paul sent Onesimus back to Philemon for three reasons. \n\nFirst: Onesimus met Paul in prison, and was now a Christian himself. It's evident that Paul wants Onesimus to settle his debt with Philemon, because Paul believes it's the honorable thing to do. Second: Paul requests in this letter (delivered by Onesimus) that Philemon allow Paul to pay off the debt that Onesimus owed. Third: Paul instructs Philemon to accept Onesimus as his brother. To paraphrase Paul, \"I now see him as my brother. If you see *me* as your brother, then you must now equally accept him as your brother too.\" I don't believe Paul was being subtle in his disapproval of this master and slave relationship between these two men.\n\nIt also parallels Christ's sacrifice on the cross. Jesus paid a debt He didn't owe, and therefore made it possible so that all of us shall be forgiven for our sins, and be made heirs in the Kingdom of Heaven. Does that make sense?",

                    "comment": "Below you'll find an answer that is an attempt to identify why it became a negative term. The problem with it, though I'm sure well-intentioned, is that it ignores HOW it became a negative term. It wasn't because of the contents of the book. It was because of the ADAPTATION of the book by white producers of plays who changed the character to fit with a southern white Christian ideology so they would be more accepting of the story. \n\nSo, when black activists of the time were becoming more noticed, southern whites used the anger against them to suggest black Americans needed more \"Uncle Toms\" who weren't so radical, angry, who accepted Jesus into their hearts blahblahblah. So these young black activists of the time responded by saying that the problem was this \"Uncle Tom\" mentality that white supremacists had. \n\nIt did not take long for the argument &amp; term to lose all nuance &amp; for people to simply see the term as having a negative connotation because the masses are terrible with even mildly complex context.\n\nAnd that problem exists today. Where we now see intelligent people try to justify why THE BOOK is seen in a poor light, fitting a square peg in a rectangular hole.",

            "comment": "Read the book. Then understand the negative connotation, the \"Uncle Tom\" slur has nothing to do with the book... but instead has to do with plays that transformed the character from a thoughtful, empathic, kind individual who died for his beliefs while protecting escaped slaves, to a bumbling, unintelligent, traitor to his own race because of his loyalty to his masters???... by white producers, DECADES LATER, for southern audiences of the time who were becoming less tolerant of black activism. \n\nAnd that when those whites saw young black activists demanding justice, they countered with, \"We need more Uncle Toms,\" having never read the book, only seen the skewed racist play. And in response, these young black activists countered that we needed to kill off this version of Uncle Tom, that we needed fewer people who capitulate to their enslavers.\n\nAnd thus began the unraveling of context &amp; reality. And it didn't happen because of MODERN thinking, or that the book doesn't affect MODERN readers positively, but because around 100 years ago the white supremacy movement was gaining so much speed that white producers knew they wouldn't attend a play that was accurately based on the book.\n\nImagine if Harry Potter was the biggest selling book for 40 years, then some producers decided to put on a play in 2040 that fit the mindset of a certain audience. In this version, Harry is a TERF. This never happens in the book but these producers make him one to fit a certain political leaning. Maybe he's also a bit sexist &amp; racist to boot.\n\nThe reaction would be very negative. And the farther we'd get from the book being read, the narrative of Harry Potter becomes more and more based on this skewed play. Cut to 100 years later, in 2140, and people are debating details in the book to fit the narrative of a play that they aren't aware of because no recording exists of it, so they start fitting the skewed narrative with the actual narrative.\n\nI call this fitting a square peg in a rectangular hole. You can make it fit. But it shouldn't.\n\nEdit: [Here is one article I found about it.](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/09/the-pervading-influence-of-em-uncle-toms-cabin-em-in-pop-culture/279281/) Unfortunately, some of the most well-researched material on this is behind university research walls.",

Fakespot detects fake reviews, fake products and unreliable sellers using AI.\n\nHere is the analysis for the Amazon product reviews:\n\n&gt;**Name**: Cold War II? China, America, Global Strategy, and the New Cold War (Quizmaster China: Political Economy) \n\n&gt;**Company**: Eric Engle\n\n&gt;**Amazon Product Rating**: 2.6 \n\n&gt;**Fakespot Reviews Grade**: A\n\n&gt;**Adjusted Fakespot Rating**: 2.6\n\n&gt;**Analysis Performed at**: 03-20-2023 \n\n[Link to Fakespot Analysis](https://fakespot.com/product/cold-war-ii-china-america-global-strategy-and-the-new-cold-war-quizmaster-china-political-economy) | [Check out the Fakespot Chrome Extension!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fakespot-analyze-fake-ama/nakplnnackehceedgkgkokbgbmfghain)\n\n*Fakespot analyzes the reviews authenticity and not the product quality using AI. We look for real reviews that mention product issues such as counterfeits, defects, and bad return policies that fake reviews try to hide from consumers.*\n\n*We give an A-F letter for trustworthiness of reviews. A = very trustworthy reviews, F = highly untrustworthy reviews. We also provide seller ratings to warn you if the seller can be trusted or not.*",

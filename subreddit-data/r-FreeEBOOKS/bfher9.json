    "postText": "To get an idea of what\u2019s available on Project Gutenberg check out these collections of books by topic: https://redd.it/bears1 - it\u2019s around 1,500 books - mythology, history, classics, mysteries,sci-fi, and more. \n\nThe good news here is you only have to set this up one time - it is rather confusing and many many people miss the step of whitelisting the email they will be using to send books to their kindle.  It is one of the most common things I see confusion about in r/FreeEBOOKS.\n\n[Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) is one of the main sources for free public domain ebooks.\n\nEbooks added this way will sync across devices like any ebook you get from Amazon. \n\n\n\nPlease ask questions in the comments below if you are having trouble figuring this out - I plan to edit the instructions as I find where folks are confused. \n\n\n# 1 - Find your send to kindle email address\n\nFirst you need to find your send to kindle email address. There are two ways to do this on your kindle or on the Amazon website, it\u2019s way easier to find on your kindle.  \n\n\n**Easy way: On your kindle: Click the gear icon -&gt; All Settings -&gt; Your Account -&gt; your send to kindle email will be listed on this page.**\n\n\nHarder way: Go to [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) then click Accounts &amp; lists-&gt; \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/up315qw13h721.jpg\n\n \n\n\nunder \u201cDigital content and devices\u201d click \u201cContent and Devices\u201d -&gt; \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bfxxh6a53h721.png\n\n \n\n\nClick \u201cDevices\u201d in the menu near the top -&gt;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/94bpbnx63h721.png\n\n \n\n\nclick the \u201c\u2026\u201d next to you kindle in the device list you see on that page. Your send to kindle email will be listed in the small box that appears.  If you are on mobile you will see a gallery of images of kindles and app icons - click a kindle and you will see your send to kindle email address displayed below.  \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/id3hyxh83h721.png\n\n \n\n\n(Do not be alarmed if you see a shitload of devices listed, every time you download the kindle app on something it counts as a device - I have \u201cdevices\u201d going back for many years of phones) \n\nYour send to kindle email address will be some variation on your name + @kindle.com\n\n\n\n \n\n# 2 - Make sure the email you will be sending emails from to your send to kindle email address is whitelisted. If the email you send books from to your kindle is not white listed you will never get the books.\n\n \n\nOn [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) click \u201cAccount &amp; Lists\u201d -&gt; \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6uzd07wj3h721.jpg\n\n \n\nunder \u201cDigital content and devices\u201d click \u201cContent and Devices\u201d -&gt;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/0sbp037l3h721.png\n\n\n\n\nclick \u201cPreferences\" in the top bar of that page -&gt; \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/33gegntn3h721.png\n\n \n\nClick \u201cPersonal Document Settings\u201d -&gt; \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xv33a2eq3h721.png\n\n \n\nfind \u201cApproved Personal Document E-mail List\u201d on that page -&gt; make sure the email you will be using to send books to your kindle is listed there.  \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cyzhtkor3h721.png\n\n\n\n\n# 3 - Let\u2019s send a book.  \n\n \n\nGo to a book on [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=downloads) \\-&gt; click either Kindle (with images) or Kindle (no images) to download the version of the ebook you would like to send to your kindle. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8r8zroxw3h721.png\n\n \n\nNow open a new email message - fill in your send to kindle email address in the to field, then drag the book file into the email. Click send.  \n\nGo to your kindle library and sync to make sure the book downloaded.  \n\nI typically send ebooks to my kindle from my phone or iPad - you will follow the same process but often when you download a file your device will ask you what you want to do with the file - just choose email and send away.",

Those are common enough, and some Amazon Kindles, B&amp;N Nooks, and things like Kobo Reader use them.\n\nIIRC, the technology was originally an MIT research product, and got spun off as a company which was later acquired by the foundry that makes the screens.  It gets the nod for low power consumption, since once the screen has been painted, no power is required to maintain it, unlike LEDs that require a constant power trickle to do so.  Users of eInk devices talk about going for weeks without needing to charge their devices.\n\neInk screens also get raves for being readable out of doors in sunlight.\n\nI passed and use a generic Android tablet because too much of what I read requires color.  There *is* a 12 bit eInk color display, but the last I looked, only one obscure manufacturer had licensed it, and 12 bit color isn't adequate for what I do.\n\nBut meanwhile, the eInk screen is simply a display, and eInk devices have drivers to access them. *What*  is displayed is not specific to the display being eInk.  (I have an orphan device that has both LED *and* eInk screens, and various hacking got done to let you pick which screen things got displayed on.)\n\nPlease note that the Kindle, Nook, and (IIRC) Kobo Reader *are* Android devices.  Because they are Android, you can get the firmware. (Amazon's firmware is at [https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200529680](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200529680))  They simply have vendor customization to suit them to be dedicated eBook viewer devices.   The various Kindle Fire units have been popular targets for rooting be cause they are cheap hardware with decent specs taht can be converted to general purpose tablets once rooted.",

Hopefully I'll read them sooner rather than later.\n\nEdit: The books aren't showing up on either my Kindle Fire or my Paperwhite. I have the \"Send to Kindle\" app installed on my computer and selected which device to send them to, but nothing happened. I even tried just using email and typing the devices' email address in, but still nothing. Any idea what I'm doing wrong?",

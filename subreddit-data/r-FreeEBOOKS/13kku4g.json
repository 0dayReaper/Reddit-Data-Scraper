I always love titles which come from poems, particularly when they use metaphor.\n\nI was on a train while backpacking across Europe when I read a comic poem by Peter Pindar about rescuing a fly from a bowl of punch. It ended in this advice, and I immediately knew my title:\n\n'Let buns and sugar for the future charm;\n\nThese will delight, and feed, and work no harm--\n\n  While Punch, the grinning, merry imp of sin,\n\nInvites th' unwary wanderer to a kiss,\n\nSmiles in his face, as though he meant him bliss,\n\n  Then, like an alligator, drags him in.'",

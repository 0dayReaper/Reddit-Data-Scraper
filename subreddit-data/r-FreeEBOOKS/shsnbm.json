Dostoevsky would wait until the final month before writing The Gambler in just 26 days.",

This was only his second time outside Russia - and at the famous spa casinos located along the Rhine, the very first time he would play roulette.\n\nMore free novels by Dostoevsky:\n\n* [Poor Folk](https://www.26reads.com/library/89998-poor-folk)\n* [Notes from Underground](https://www.26reads.com/library/64166-notes-from-underground)\n* [Crime and Punishment](https://www.26reads.com/library/19590-crime-and-punishment)\n* [The Brothers Karamazov](https://www.26reads.com/library/93119-the-brothers-karamazov)\n\nEdit: We have our own subreddit now! /r/26reads",

I understand that this made a lot of money out of Russians (and other visitors over the years) and Dostoevsky in particular. This is where he started his novel.  His casino of Roulettenburg seems to be a composite of the classic casinos of the time, Wiesbaden, Bad Homburg and Baden-Baden.",

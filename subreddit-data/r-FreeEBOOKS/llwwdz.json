            "comment": "I have read it, and you may say that maybe I didn't read it as it should have been, but I found the fiction artificial, like someone is forcing the story throughout the entire chapters. I understand that vagueness is the beauty of fiction; nothing is explained in an obvious manner, however, ambiguity to the point where the only thing left is an ambiguous story with characters dancing according to the writer's wishes is odd. Look at his other work, like The Metamorphosis; you will feel that no one is not forcing the story; these are the characters themselves that are leading the story. Something occurred to a character one day, and everything next was a sequel of the previous event. I found this independence of characters missing in The Trial. Every character seems to be bound by an \u201cexternal\u201d force that is controlling and manipulating them. If we try to link the story of The Trial to Kafka\u2019s personal life, then this story does take us somewhere. There are different manifestations of this fiction's meanings, which is a sign of a great novel, but I think it may not be his best work.\n\nThe best part I like about this novel is that as you read it, you will feel suffocation and will be befuddled at everything occurring in the story. This feeling will only grow as the story progresses and will eventually reach its pinnacle at the end. Flaws of the judicial system or anything else, a marvel which has flawlessly captured a human feeling and lets you experience this as if you were Joseph K. himself.",

Can't even read a few pages from the first chapter without checking it out first.\n\nI guess that this is a restriction placed on Archive.org by the publishers. But here is the thing: I think these types of restrictions actually encourage people to not play by the rules. ",

They have to buy the E-book, and then they can lend it out like a regular book, following the same rules.  This is the Library System. I think they can actually loan out more than one copy at a time, and if I'm right, then it's more generous than the physical book system that's been in place. ",

If you can read the scanned images in your browser, that's your best bet. Getting encrypted EPUB requires Adobe Digital Editions plus getting signed into it with a valid Adobe ID.",

It's a book that should be read by everybody in MN, maybe everyone on the planet.",

Who is banning and why does anybody care?\n\nMy Chinese brother in law grew up during the cultural revolution and read bootleg copies of Three Kingdoms and other classics under the covers at night with a mini flashlight, and would have been in a world of shit had he been caught. That\u2019s an example of a banned-book problem.\n\nThe list presented here is nothing more than pretentious chicken-shit by people who think they matter when in fact they\u2019re as valuable as a pimple on an elephant\u2019s ass. If you want to buy a banned book, then just go on Amazon and fucking buy it, if you use kindle, you\u2019ll have it in nanoseconds. Are you worried you might have to spend $9.99? Then just grit your teeth and deal with these first-world problems.\"\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/bannedbooks/comments/u1pdko/z/i4n7xeo",

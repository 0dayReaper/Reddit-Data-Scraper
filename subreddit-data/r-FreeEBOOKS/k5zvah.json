This portfolio will demonstrate to potential employers who don't have those filters that you are more than capable. You can showcase your projects on LinkedIn, or better yet, on your own website which you'll be able to create if you take some web design and development courses. You also might consider paying for some certificates of completion from MIT on edx which are reasonably priced and would further prove to your employers that you know your stuff. Aside from this resource, there's also the OSSU computer science curriculum that emphasizes auditing courses from a number of different universities, doing their projects, and not paying for the certificates.",

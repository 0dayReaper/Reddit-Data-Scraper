    "postText": "Hi good people,\n\nI'm pursuing a career as a historian and I've decided that if I want to keep going in renaissance studies, it's worth learning ecclesiastical Latin. There question is, where?\n\nI've done undergrad and postgrad studies at UNE, which has a fantastic online study setup. They also have a great Latin course (I'm friends with several of the Latin students), but it's for Classical Latin (not ecclesiastical Latin). ACU, on the other hand, has a church Latin sequence, but I have no idea what it's like to be an external student there. Does anyone here know what it's like?\n\nAny feedback would be super awesome. Cheers!",

Anyway remember to tell all friends about our subreddit and also I mod the facebook stalker space. Anyone have any ideas? No one really cares to use it too much. Feel free to drop some posts about accommodation, courses, books, parties, campus stuff, awesome things around fitzroy (melb). Thanks reddit heads. ",

Also it just looks amazing. The Workers club (corner of gertrude street? past the post office, anyway, I think. Don't remember the actual address, haha) also has cheap drinks/food on monday nights, and some pretty good gigs there.  ",

When I did have a bit of money last year, I used to just go down to the 7Eleven and Maccas down the road like a loner during breaks. \n\nAs far as ways to advertise the subreddit, maybe ask the ACU Confessions page on Facebook (which is pretty popular) to advertise with a short post?",

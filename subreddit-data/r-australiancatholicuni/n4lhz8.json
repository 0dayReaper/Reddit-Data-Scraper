    "postText": "Hi everyone! \n\nI\u2019m interested in taking up Biomedical Science in ACU North Sydney campus. I wanted to work in diagnostics and/or research (microbiology and genetics in particular). I just want to ask if the degree has enough laboratory practical experience in both units and if there are electives available that are highly relevant to the subjects. \n\nThank you very much!",

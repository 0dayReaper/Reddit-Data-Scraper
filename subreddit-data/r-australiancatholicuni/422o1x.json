    "postText": "So I accepted my offer to start the BNursing degree at ACU this year.  I don't seem to have access to any kind of text lists yet, I'm guessing they will be available in Feb. Are there any nursing students here that can give me a heads up on any texts I'll definitely need to buy for semester 1. I'd like to try get second hand books but I don't want to buy anything I don't need by accident.\n",

I'm an EEN, going into the double bachelor for para and nursing but I recommend from the prior diploma course not buying anything until you desperately need it except the following:\n\n1. Harvard's Nursing Guide to Drugs by Tiziani\n2. any nursing clinical mathematics book really\n3. a decently thick nursing dictionary\n\nbecause they were awesome to have.",

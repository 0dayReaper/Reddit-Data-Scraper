            "comment": "Hey people.\nThought I'd throw my two cents in the mix.\n\nI'm the Station Manager for the Melbourne campus contingent of ACU Wired (yes we have station managers). Wired is broadcast over all the campuses and streams online, with different campuses taking over different days. As of Semester 2 2013, we broadcast on the following days: \n\n* Monday 10am to 4pm (Brisbane campus)\n\n* Tuesday 10am to 5pm (Melbourne campus)\n\n* Wednesday 10am to 4pm (Strathfield campus)\n\n* Thursday 10am to 5pm (Melbourne campus)\n\n* Friday 10am to 4pm (Brisbane campus)\n\nI'd say the best way to listen in would be to head to the ACU Wired Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/ACUWired), there's a link there to listen to the online stream (http://www.acu.edu.au/269420). There are also links to the individual show pages for the Melbourne campus, along with pages for both the Brisbane and Strathfield campuses.\n\nIf you are looking to put a show forward, feel free to head to the studio or contact me here for information.\n\nThanks",

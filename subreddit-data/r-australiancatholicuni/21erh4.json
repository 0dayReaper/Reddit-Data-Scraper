    "postText": "Hi, I'm a student at Free University of Berlin and currently writing a research paper on Foucault's heterotopias and the spatial integration of life and death in zombie parodies. \n\nNow, I realize that sounds a bit bizarre, but thing is, I really really need this one chapter/article from a book because it's the only actual academic work that has been done on one of the films I'll be discussing, and I just can't find that book anywhere. \nThere is one library that has it in Berlin, but it's taken out until May. Needless to say, my paper is due way earlier (March 31st, actually, which is why I'm getting a bit desperate and posting here).\n\nYour library is the only one I could find that has the chapter I need fully available online - for it's own students, of course. So it's there, but I can't access it. What I'm trying to ask here is... could one of you maybe access/download the article and send it to me? It would really help me out a lot and I swear I'll only be using it for good ;)\n\n\nThe text in question is:\n\nRace, Oppression and the Zombie. Essays on Cross-Cultural Appropriations of the Caribbean Tradition. Ed. Christopher M. Moreman and Cory James Rushton. Jefferson NC and London: McFarland, 2011.\n\nOf course the whole book contains information I could use, but the chapter I really need is:\n\nMichele Braun. \"It\u2019s So Hard to Get Good Help These Days: Zombies as a Culturally Stabilizing Force in Fido (2006)\" \n\n\nThe link to the available books in your library search:\nhttp://primo.unilinc.edu.au/primo_library/libweb/action/dlSearch.do?cs=frb&amp;ct=frb&amp;frbg=266311875&amp;fctN=facet_frbrgroupid&amp;fctV=266311875&amp;doc=aleph002169879&amp;lastPag=&amp;lastPagIndx=&amp;rfnGrp=frbr&amp;frbrSrt=date&amp;dscnt=1&amp;onCampus=false&amp;query=isbn%2Ccontains%2C0786459115&amp;scp.scps=&amp;dstmp=1395837930222&amp;ct=search&amp;indx=1&amp;fromLogin=true&amp;vl(freeText0)=0786459115&amp;group=GUEST&amp;fn=search&amp;vid=ACU&amp;institution=ACU\n\n\nThank you in advance, in case anyone would consider it :)",

I'm not sure whether I have Adobe Digital Editions, but I'll try to get a hold of the program :) \nThe chapter consists of pages 150-162, those are all I really need, so maybe screenshots would actually be possible too! I'll PM you my email.",

It's on **Sunday 21st of May - 3pm at the Brunswick Hotel** (140 Sydney Road, Brunswick). It'll feature some local Melbourne based artists including *triple j unearthed artists Elk + Mammoth and Josiah*. It would be awesome if you guys could come along and support the cause! (and my uni grade lol) ***Tickets are only $10 at the door!*** Hope to see you all there! :)",

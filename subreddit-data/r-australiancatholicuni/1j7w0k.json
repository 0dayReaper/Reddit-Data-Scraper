    "postText": "Hey all. What you looking forward to this semester? Any new news about any of the campuses? \n\nAlso curious to know what the other campuses are like as I may want to transfer one day for a 4th year. \n\nI know in melb we are a fair small uni, probably the smallest, compared to all the others, most people know of us though, the people are pretty tame, no wild punk rocker or stoner looking people, only a few hipsters lol. Everyone is pretty friendly at uni. Lots of cafes, bars, florists, art shops and clothes shops all around. Pretty trendy urban area, but Fitzroy has some homeless people and some nuts/odd people, but love being right in the city walking past shop windows everyday and being able to try a new cafe or window shop so much. \nSo let me know what your campus is like just to fill my curiosity. \n\nRemember to invite friends to this sub so we can expand as a community :)",

            "comment": "the main thing i didn't like about ACU is there is basically no social programs or clubs. Or things every other major uni has like a medical service with doctors, a student rights service, accommodation, etc. Melbourne campus is better now that we have the new library and a second building with a gym (something else we lacked before that) but the complete lack of clubs and societies REALLY needs to be rectified. I know Melbourne once had a performing arts group but as a drama student I heard from them that they were told they could only perform things that fit with the \"catholic ethos\" by the vice chancellor, sigh. That, and when they send out emails about things like anti-abortion rallies or religious speakers when they're fully aware not everyone at the uni is catholic...",

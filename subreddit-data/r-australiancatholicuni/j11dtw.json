In my undergrad, I\u2019ve heard people get a week extension but I haven\u2019t heard of anyone getting any longer. I\u2019m doing my honours this year and applied for a one month extension on my thesis and it was granted but that might just be because it\u2019s a big project. I\u2019d say a week is a safe bet but I couldn\u2019t find anything in writing. It\u2019s all down to circumstances and your lecturer at ACU.",

I\u2019d send it to your lecturer and if they\u2019re not the person who authorises it, they should forward it on to the relevant staff member or at least tell you who to send it to.\nGood luck with the assignment.",

    "postText": "I am a student in WA thinking of transferring to ACU.\nI am already studying nursing but will be moving to melbourne and deciding between Deakin and ACU. Any advice on why you think ACU has been a good choice? And RE the prac, in Perth we do prac in blocks, so 5 weeks after each semester at either 1 facility or 2, and we do not choose where. Is it the same style at ACU? I have heard in other states they do fellowships or 2 days each week.\nTIA",

I haven't heard much about the ACU course but in general I think ACU is a pretty good uni. As for pracs, I think Deakin has shorter semesters and and the prac blocks are in the holidays. Not too sure about ACU. Hope this helps!!",

    "postText": "# INTEREST CHECK: Study with Me sessions on ZOOM !\n\nHas anyone here have or tried a group SWM (study with me) session on ZOOM? Is this something people would be interested in doing?\n\nI like to study late at night but with this whole rona thing, being inside all day ! ! is seriously giving us a hard time concentrating, even on times I'm usually able to :( I'm (supposed to be) studying 70% of my spare time because I've got a few (now virtual) extracurriculars that I have weekly deadlines on :(( So far, I've been relying on my friends for this, but they have healthier bedtimes and are working as well;; yes, I know I can go outside but I limit it to twice a week max as long word alert (I'm immunocompromised)\n\nIdeally, I'll run them whenever I'm home and don't have classes on Zoom ! Those times are: **Tuesday** (*8:15pm - 2am*); **Wed** (*11:15am-5pm; 8:15pm-2am*); **Thurs** (*8am-12pm; 1:30pm-12am*); **Fri** (*8am-12pm; 4pm-12am*); **Sat** (*8am-12pm; 1:30-12am*); **Sunday** (*8am-12am; sometimes off*); and **Mondays off**.\n\nGoogle Calendar will have these schedules a week in advance, and would vary depending on my future social plans. Generally though, they'll stay the same- likely a couple changes per week max, or not even ! I'll send the invite through gmail to whoever's interested, and the meeting ID will stay the same throughout ( until whenever this at home thing ends :/ )\n\nThinking of being a co-host to fill in more time slots? Let me know !",

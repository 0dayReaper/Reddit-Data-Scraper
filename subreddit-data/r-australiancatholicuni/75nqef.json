    "postText": "Hi there, I've heard this subreddit is almost in hibernation mode but I'll just give it a shot.\n\nLong story short, I'll have finished my first year of science at another uni in Melbourne this November and I'm thinking of transferring to ACU due to lower tuition fees (international full fee-paying). From what I could gather from the website, there were only 18 students doing the course at the Melbourne campus in 2017. The number gives me an uneasy feeling.\n\nHas anyone here that done the course at ACU can shed some light on this matter? How was your experience How was the teaching? How hard was it to secure a job after graduation?\n\nMuch appreciated. ",

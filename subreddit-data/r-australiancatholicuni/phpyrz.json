    "postText": "We are looking for Australian parents (especially fathers) who have at least two children aged 2 to 18 to complete an online survey about their views of their children\u2019s sibling relationships and sibling conflict, use of strategies for parenting support and their own wellbeing levels. The survey is completely anonymous, and the information collected will be used as part of Masters and Honours research projects. Participation involves completing an online survey, which will take approximately 30 minutes and asks a range of questions about parenting and sibling relationships. We are interested in factors that might influence how parents view their children\u2019s sibling relationships.  \n \n\nIf you are interested in participating, please go to the below link for further information and to complete the survey:  \n \n\n[**https://acu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_dijsDd70Dgh380K**](https://acu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dijsDd70Dgh380K)  \n \n\nThank you!  \n \n\nYours sincerely,  \n \n\n**Daina Krasts &amp; Emma McGregor**  \n **Under the supervision of Dr Emma Little**  \n **School of Psychology**  \n **ACU**  \n **17 Young St**  \n **Fitzroy**",

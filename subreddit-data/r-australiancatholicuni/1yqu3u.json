The main challenge isn't finding one, it's getting them to sign the forms before and after. It's amazing how many places seem desperate for volunteers but the minute you email them a form to sign they stop returning your calls or claim they don't have an officr",

I had an interview with them and have to attend a training session on the 8th.\n\nAfter that, they'll send my info to the organisation I showed interest in and I'll then call them up and get the paperwork sorted. Put in my request for an extension while I was at Uni on Thursday. Hoping to hear back soon. ",

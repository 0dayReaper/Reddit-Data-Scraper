    "postText": "Alright guys, here's the idea (I thought I would run it by the subreddit, see what you guys reckon and whether there's an audience for it):\n\nMost of you should know that ACU features a few clubs and societies that students can join - things like SIFE, the Acting society, ACU sports and so on. Students may also submit a form to the Student Association requesting that they have an official Society or Club opened.\n\nAfter visiting SwinGamers events over at Swinburne a couple of times, I saw how well their setup worked, and how much fun they all had. So I began thinking: Why not us? With a bit of effort and some careful planning, we could set up our very own Video Gaming society! This could also be extended to tabletop/board games if people are interested, but that's not the focus right now. What are your thoughts? Would you like to see a Gaming Society at the Melbourne campus, with regular events and tournaments?",

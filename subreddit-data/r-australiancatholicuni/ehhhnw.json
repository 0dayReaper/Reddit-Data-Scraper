Most of the content is on campus but the material is identical across all campuses. Average days 3.5 to 4 days.\nCheers,\nTony. \n. \nI'm going to apply for next year \u270c\ufe0f",

Yeah not too bad.\nWhat was the myotherapy like?\nI got into Latrobe with health sciences (accelerated) to start T2 but they said I wouldn't be able to transfer to physio because grades wouldn't be released in time.\nSo waiting to apply for Latrobe and acu for 2021.",

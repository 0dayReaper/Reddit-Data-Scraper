    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nMy name is Violet. I am a fourth-year Australian psychology student doing research for my thesis. I am exploring the impact of social media on sense of belonging and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nI am looking for participants to complete my online survey. Anyone that is currently living in NSW Australia, is a university student, and studied in 2020 and 2021 can complete the survey. It takes around 20 minutes. There is a $100 e-gift voucher up for grabs.\n\n[https://sydney.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_9QYvmN92sMKFwou](https://sydney.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9QYvmN92sMKFwou)\n\nThank you in advance!",

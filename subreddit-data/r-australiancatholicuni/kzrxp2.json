    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m currently a first year undergraduate student in the Philippines and I am planning to move to Australia in the future so I have been deciding on whether or not I should study in ACU. I\u2019m planning to take up Nursing/BusinessAd or BiomedicalSci/BusinessAd in the North Sydney campus. I can\u2019t decide on whether I should just finish my undergraduate degree here and just take up a postgrad in Australia as my desired courses cannot be taken online and I can\u2019t really go there right now since the international borders are still closed.\n\nI would just like to ask, is the Nursing/BiomedSci/BusinessAd degree of ACU worth it (in terms of university experience, quality of teaching, and employment after getting my degree)? Or should I apply for other universities in Sydney such as USyd, UNSW, or UTS? I\u2019m also quite hesitant about these universities because they are much more expensive compared to ACU, where I already got my acceptance offer. Thank you in advance!\n\nP.S. I was thinking of enrolling in ACU for undergrad since it was cheaper and when I finally become a PR or citizen in Australia, it will be cheaper for me to study for postgrad (or will it not?)",

Everyone is really friendly from my experience at the North Sydney and Strathfield campuses and the academics staff all seem more than knowledgeable in their field.\n\nAll in all, I have nothing but good things to say about ACU so I\u2019d be happy to recommend it.",

Doing a duel degree means you\u2019ll have both qualifications though which is always nice to have on a CV/resum\u00e9 anyway if you\u2019re happy to do that.",

Our whole class didn\u2019t understand an subject because the instructions were awful and the coordinator told us to read said instructions again despite even the teachers of the class being confused by them. I deferred my course for a year and when I went to return last year they had stopped admissions and are removing the course so I now have to begin again despite almost being finished. Do not recommend it.",

I check Reddit pretty much every day (don't post that much, more of a lurker - wanna change that though haha) and I'm on Facebook heaps too. As my flair says, I'm in my second year of Bach Arts. \n\nNot sure how I could promote the subreddit as I'm not the most social lad going around, but I'll find a way and will definitely listen to any suggestions.

    "postText": "Hello! I am a prospective transfer student to Cmu. Central was my second choice in schools and I currently attend UCincy but am looking to transfer back home bc of the housing crisis here among other things. I am a psychology major and a lot of my credits will transfer over and my experience with the staff and everything at Central has been really good they\u2019ve had great communication and everything which I really appreciate. \n\nIs there anything I should know before I confirm attendance? Maybe some psych majors could fill me in on the program as well as just campus life, housing, and other things that you like or dislike about Central. Thanks :)",

            "comment": "Should be pretty straightforward. To graduate you will need 120 credits total- 30 from CMU. You\u2019ll need 40 credits at the 300 level. The required classes in order are Psy 100, psy stats, research methods 1, and then 2. Each one is needed before the next. [This](https://netconnect.cmich.edu/whatwilltransfer) website should help. Also check the website and see if there is a professor who shares your area of interest and email them.",

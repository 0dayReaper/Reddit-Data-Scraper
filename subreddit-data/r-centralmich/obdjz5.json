Long, Long time ago.\n\nSafari &amp; Impact both will not tell you anything until about a week before with who your ambassador is (group lead), where to meet, and what time you should be there. They usually are still working through the kinks around this time. Just keep an eye on your email and the dates suggested open.\n\nYou're going to be tired, but it is an absolutely great program. Same with Safari. I personally only did Safari, but it really kicked off the start to the University level well. I think about 80% of the incoming freshman class ends up doing it.",

Both experiences are unique, but equally as valuable. As a former participant of both and a current staff member, you\u2019re going to have a blast so long as you put your best foot forward! You get out of each experience what you put into it. \n\nCan\u2019t wait to have you on campus this fall! Best of luck with your studies &amp; your time here at CMU! Fire up!",

If you don't get a good amount off, go to a community college for 2 years and get the Gen Eds out of the way. No point putting yourself further in debt when the same classes are taught at the community college level. \n\nAnyway, I have toured all the Mid-size Universities in Michigan. These include CMU, Western, Grand Valley, Oakland, Eastern, and Wayne (Sorry for anyone that wasn't mentioned.) UofM and State are too big to make yourself stand out in the crowd. Central is perfect as you still get a college life a bit, and you can really stick out compared to your peers, as the university is still well known throughout the US. (Me being in NC, I have no problems with employers not knowing Central Michigan). It is different from Oakland, Eastern, and Wayne as those are commuter Universities, and not actual real life universities. GVSU and Western have a very particular group of people that are drawn to it, and just are not ideal in my opinion. \n\nThe school has a lot of good programs all around too, whether you are in Engineering, IT, Healthcare, Business, History, I believe all of them are well rounded programs. I moved to Charlotte, NC, and everyone here knows the programs Central Michigan puts out. You think the name wouldn't go as far as UofM and State, but it sure does. \n\nMt Pleasant is a great city too. There is a enough to do there to keep you busy (as much as people might disagree with me). The town is very small, but has its fair share of bar scene, club, and other areas of interest. Everything you can do is walking distance, or a 5 minute car ride away with your friend. The cost of living there is a lot cheaper too, as it is the only \"real\" college town in Michigan. (Ann Arbor turned into an IT hub, and EL is more government than College most of the year) \n\nYou won't have the balance of good professors, sports, college life, college feel, and university outreach in any other package than Central Michigan. Take it from me being in NC.",

The university took out a massive debt to prop up their campus and make it brand spanking new. CMU has had a lot of development the last 10 years since the EHS building was built in 2008, but GVSU has seen probably triple. My sister went there from 2011-2015. I feel it lacks community though. \n\nWestern, in my opinion is the new party school. Their sports programs have been killing it the past 10 or so years, and some of the biggest parties I have been to are at WMU. People go there for a fun time. I have seen it, haha.\n\nCMU is kinda a mix of both, but with an added layer of community. The isolation of Mt Pleasant really brings people together, interacting with one another. The problem Central has is they don't focus enough on the student, which has been hurting their enrollment.",

They have a couple of good 4 year degrees too for healthcare. \n\nAgain, I always recommend though going into the program that is the best fit for you. Traveling doesn't seem to be a problem for you as you are going to Iowa and Boise as well. Just know that programs like CMU and EMU will keep you closer to family. That is hard to come by when you go so far away. \n\nBest of luck finding your college of choice, and Congratulations on all of the offers. If I was in your shoes though, I'd go to the program that will get you the most experience in the PT field, as all the extra programs and volunteer work will get you into the doctorate programs. Don't go solely on degree.",

Its definitely a smaller school and in retrospect it was in the middle of nowhere lol. But like another commenter said, there is plenty of night life and things to do on and off campus. Looking back I wouldn't change it for anything. The smaller campus size was actually perfect me and it gave me more of an opportunity to stand out in my particular program (Fashion Merch and Design). I graduated after four years with good job prospects thanks to the activities I was involved in at CMU. I live in Raleigh, NC now and there's a surprisingly large group of CMU alumni in the area, so I am confident you will find alumni where ever you end up post grad. \n\nI totally support people's decision to start at a community college and transfer a few years in, but I'll be honest I am extremely glad I didn't. Everyone is different, but I personally took a while to come out of my shell and don't know if I ever would have if I didn't start off as a freshman in the dorms. Also, avoid the freshmen Leadership Safari week at all costs. It was awful. \n\nGood luck with whatever you decide to do! If you do choose Central I hope you love it as much as I did!",

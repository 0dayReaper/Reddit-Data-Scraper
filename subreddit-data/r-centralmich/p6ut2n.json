    "postText": "Hi everyone!  \n\n\nMy name is Cameron and I am the Production Manager for the RSO Moore Media Records. As this school year begins, we are ready to get back to some sense of normalcy and this means that live events, more ambitious projects, and our collaborations with MHTV will be available. This means we need students who love music and want to be apart of its process.   \n\n\n**ANYBODY** can join and attendance is non-mandatory. Feel free to be apart of the org at your own pace.   \n\n\nMoore Media Records is CMU's student ran record label and recording studio. We record bands, solo artists, voice-over, and we have demo services for people interested in studio time to record their audio needs. We also collaborate with MHTV to produce *Summit Sessions Live,* a KEXP/Tiny Desk style show that is live on CMU's public station and streamed to YouTube. We also produce a sampler every semester which can be listened to on our website [www.mooremediarecords.com](https://www.mooremediarecords.com).   \n\n\nWith all of these projects, an organization like MMR needs a diverse set of skills to make it run. This includes not only prospective audio engineers but also videographers, graphic designers, promoters, social media managers, artist recruitment, and much more.  \n\n\n**Moore Media Records is first and foremost a RSO centered around people who love music**.   \n\n\nIf this interests you, please come to our first General Staff meeting on September 2nd. It is located in Moore Hall 182. It is next to the Radio Station and MHTV. If you have any questions email me at [ulsha1c@cmich.edu](mailto:ulsha1c@cmich.edu).   \n\n\n\\- Cameron, Production Manager.",

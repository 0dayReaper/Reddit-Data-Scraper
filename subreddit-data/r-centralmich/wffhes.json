    "postText": "Hi guys, I have just completed my high-school and was suggested by few friends to apply for Bachelor's program of Computer Science Engineering at Central Mich. I had a query about the employment opportunities after passing out. \n\nI have read about the internships and tie-ups of CMU with big tech institutions. But I wanted to delve deeper and know it from the people here itself. How good is the job circuit around?\n\nI want honest answers so I'd like to clarify that I'm looking for real and achievable perspectives!",

            "comment": "I graduated in 2013 with a degree in Information Technology, so related. One of the biggest suggestions I can offer you is to try to find a job on or around campus in your field. For me, I found a booth during orientation and got a temporary job through the school; helping set up other freshman laptops with the university AV software and making sure they are compliant. from that job, I was placed in another on campus job with the OIT networking department. they kept me employed with flexible hours to work with class schedules and such through all 4 years and, in my case, lead to an internship that got me in the career that I'm still in today, nearly 10 years later. \n\nMy path was pretty unique and \"lucky\", however if you go out of your way to put yourself out there with jobs and experiences, opportunities will fall into your lap (my required internship was offered by a former co-worker who graduated and suggested I intern at his company for my credits). \n\nIt's worth mentioning that the department heads will send emails and postings for job and internship offerings throughout the semester too. \n\nMy personal view is that if I could do it again, I would choose Central every time and I loved my experiences, but classes alone won't get you everything you need to be successful in the IT industry. Get out and get hands on experience in any way you can.\n\nHope this helps.",

            "comment": "I graduated with a computer science bachelors and have been employed with one of the largest engineering companies in the world creating manufacturing software. Most of my classmates have been gainfully employed as well. Really it depends more on the person and what they do during university and the drive to succeed than anything.\n\nWhile saying that I would recommend a different school for computer science. I am not sure of the computer science department nowadays since I was there 10 years ago, but I would probably go somewhere else for computer science.\n\nComputer science is not one of CMU's major programs and the students in the program are not very good, resulting in a lackluster experience and education.\n\nMy advice, definitely get an internship during the summer at least once and create something, anything that you're proud of to show off when you graduate. Not like a class project or anything, write an app, or a game, something you can talk about later. Also preferably get a part-time or freelance software gig. Also don't fuck off too much. My biggest regret attending university was not being as studious, or academic as I should have been but also don't be a square, being personable and well rounded goes further after school and life in general than being the smartest or most studious.\n\nEdit: Also the comment from u/mcclinsr below closely resembles my own experience. CMU also gave me on campus job opportunities that basically let me be productive the first week in a relevant stack (.NET) when I got my first job out of school. It was pretty easy after school to get job offers because I had 2 years of .NET experience in a production environment on my resume. While not the best school, CMU gave me those opportunities and I am not sure I would have gotten that anywhere else. So its really a tough choice you'll have to make but its not like if you choose a different school or go to CMU will really matter too much in the long run. Nobody really cares what school you went to in our field unless it was like MIT, Stanford, Harvard, etc. Just try to stand out and do your best.",

My first priority would definitely be scholarship-based courses since I come from a relatively middle-class family in third-world Asian country (synonymous with being in hell), so any moderate US college will also do for me! \n\nThe biggest factor is about placements since it all depends on your hard work. So it's better to invest your hard work in a favorable college. Hence I was looking for colleges which fall in the mid-tier, offering good environment, good career path and package options. \n\nObviously, I won't daydream of Ivy League Colleges but provided that US is the hub of Computer Technology in the world, I want to rest assured that I enroll in a world-class college with good resources and great opportunities!",

                            "comment": "I heard while going to CMU that many foreign students went to CMU because in other countries the \u201ccentral\u201d school is thought to be the best, or higher quality. However in the US it doesn\u2019t really matter if the school has \u201ccentral\u201d in its name or not. \n\nSo the best school (in Michigan) for computer science is the University of Michigan. You could try there, the requirements for acceptance are higher but it\u2019s a top tier university for computer science in the world let alone the US. MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon (also abbreviated CMU) are the top schools but they\u2019re also very expensive as they are private schools. If your grades are good you could potentially get a scholarship.\n\nAlso as an aside and some more unsolicited advice. If you haven\u2019t already I\u2019d start learning to program. Preferably with a heavier language like C or C++. Also, computer science programs in almost all universities are heavy on theoretical, general, and mathematical applications of computer science however lack in practical applications. For instance they won\u2019t teach you how to work on large enterprise applications and multi tiered applications in stacks like .NET, SQL Server, Java Spring, etc. So while a computer science degree is overall a good degree, you can be lacking in actual real world experience and knowledge in areas business actually cares about once you graduate. So learn some boring shit that would be useful in a corporate setting.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re not passionate about CS then you should condition yourself to be. While CS is a good field with good opportunities (which is heading for a correction most likely) you will put yourself ahead by actually being passionate about computer science rather than a means to a good paying career. The best and happiest engineers are passionate about their work. So be passionate :)",

I would take posts about people \"not learning anything\" in their CS program with a grain of salt because you hear that from people no matter where they went to school. I think a lot of the value from college comes from internships you're able to get as an upperclassmen. I'd venture to say that most of the courses you take in college anywhere are not going to provide you with actual career skills. As a CS student you should get a good understanding of the principles of programming but you're not likely to get experience in every development stack or environment you will encounter in the \"real world.\" Success after college often requires self-learning and motivation to find quality internships. \n\nI can't speak for CS, or really even the current state of the business school where I graduated from, but I will say when I graduated from the Information Systems program in 2014 almost everyone in the program had a job lined up before graduation. The program was somewhat competitive and you'd feel embarrassed if you didn't have a proper internship during school or job lined up before graduation. CMU is more of a regional university so a lot of the internships and job opportunities you will find are Michigan or Midwest based. You are probably not going to get an internship at a silicon valley-based company unless you really go above and beyond.",

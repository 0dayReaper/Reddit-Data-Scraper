    "postText": "I'm a senior at CMU this year. As an incoming freshman I appealed to live off campus with my family because we live pretty close. I had intended on living somewhere else for my last 2 years at least, maybe even sophomore year too, but my brother was diagnosed with brain cancer during my freshman year so it was best for me to continue to stay home. It was a turbulent couple of years. He passed away this April. I've recently realized that I've missed out on a lot of aspects of college life that I'm running out of time to experience. \n\nI don't begrudge staying home since ultimately it saved me money and allowed me to support my brother. And logically it would make more sense for me to continue staying at home or even to get an apartment instead. And I also know that I'm running out of time to figure it out. But this idea was brought up by my counselor today and I felt a need to research it regardless. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",

But I personally didn't enjoy the rules and expenses of the dorms, so I preferred off campus my last 2 years",

That's only marginally better than being 21 going in to it.\n\nNext year you'll have to start living on your own, presumably, so you might as well get started now, really. You'll have to figure out how to find like minded people without relying on proximity, so it's probably a great idea to start that a little early.\n\nEither way, best of luck going forward. Enjoy your senior year.",

I did a lot of IT work for the university, and often helped out on campus. Every person I talked to over 21 hated the dorms, primarily because their RAs usually were younger than them, and had more power. The maturity of people in the Dorms sucks too, and you don't get much freedom to do as you please. \n\nComing from me, you'd probably enjoy it for the first couple of months, but once the weather starts to get cold and people aren't as active, you'll probably end up hating it. Sure your family is nearby and you can get a break from it, but it just isn't ideal long term. Most of the people you will talk to will be sub-21, so itll all be hanging in dorm rooms and going to Wayside (which is not fun at 21).\n\nDo what I did when I went to CMU for my short time. Live off-campus, but right on campus. I lived right across Bellows in a United house, and walked on campus often and was part of the on-campus life.  If you can't get one of those, look into West Campus Village. I see they have openings currently there. If you really want to be in the heat of everything, and be walking distance, Western Islands are amazing. You have access to everything on Mission, and walking distance from the library, and every southern part of the University. Plus, it looks very impressive when you go dating, bonus points there. ;)\n\nUnited has its issues though. They suck with charges after you leave, and will penny-pinch you if you're not on top of your payments. Keep this in mind for BOTH your roommates, as well as yourself. \n\nSorry to hear about your brother. I miss the hell out of Mt Pleasant, and you definitely deserve to have a kickass last year of College. Make sure you make the right move, and don't get caught up in the moment. I live in a Southern city now in a completely different state, surrounded around tons of stuff to do ($1500 rent 1B 1B). It still doesn't beat the college days and what Central has. Those will always be the glory years of my life. I hope they are yours when you look back 5 years too!",

You'll need to brush up on [the rules](https://www.cmich.edu/ess/residencelife/Pages/housing-policies.aspx) before you commit, for sure \n\nYou're going to be 21 and you're going to want to do 21 year old stuff, which necessarily involves some individual freedoms that you gain. Living in the dorm seems like it will be more of a hinderance to that and repeated violations could negatively impact your career at CMU.\n\nI similarly didn't live on campus and thought about doing that at one point. Basically every single one of my friends said that I would hate it. I'm not much of a drinker, but even though you're allowed to, it kind of feels like you're sneaking around mom and dad. If you lived in an apartment close to campus near a bunch of other people who are also students, you would get a very similar experience without having to go through all that restriction that could potentially damage your standing at CMU. It just doesn't seem worth the risk.",

The question becomes whether living in the dorm would help me be as independent as I'm looking to become or just handicap me. \n\nAnd actually, it could make me feel like an underclassman. Which isn't what I'm looking for either.",

I felt myself contemplating these things because they were familiar and that familiarly was comfortable. But ultimately, you grow as a person when you experience things outside of your comfort zone.\n\nI really do think that you would be much better off in an apartment with a couple of similar aged roommates than in the dorm with freshmen who will almost certainly be less mature and have very little in common with you other than address.",

Your group mates in class will be in roughly the same area. You will have to travel to them or the lib. \n\n\nYou can make friends, you seriously can. I don't think that your best opportunity is in the dorms tho. It's a bit of a dick wagging contest in there",

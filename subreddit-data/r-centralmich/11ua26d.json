I'm only 20 so I can't really drink so any non-alcoholic places would be amazing. By the looks of it on Google it seems to be pretty much regular nightclubs and bars. Thank you so much in advance!",

Or are they one of those places where they \"accept\" you but still condemn you? Because I've had people in the past tell me churches were queer-friendly but that just ended up meaning \"I think you're going to hell, but I'll be your friend.\"\n\nWhile I'm not a Christian I do enjoy helping out at church events such as pantries and holidays. I feel more comfortable in areas where I feel as if I don't have to hide my identity.",

Wow. That's really, really sad to hear. I know enrollment has been down like crazy, but I hate seeing my university go through this.\n\nNot going to lie, administration is doing this to itself. Focusing on football, raising tuition, and not providing funding to appropriate degrees are the issues. Not to mention a failure to address something as simple as student food. The board needs to be replaced completely.  \n\nCMU should do a tuition freeze for 10 years and watch the student body skyrocket when they are the lowest option within Michigan.",

Until 2019, there wasn't even a semblance of officially recognizing that anything in their processes/policies were wrong. They would project a strong enrollment forecast and then be shocked when it was way off once the fall semester started.",

    "postText": "It's my day off from work and I noticed a few more moving trucks than usual coming into Tallgrass to move people in. Are people moving back already? I know it's a little early but sooner or later the Mad Max style caravans of of people driving around for Welcome Week will be here, along with loads of freshman, transfers, and people not familiar with Mt. Pleasant.\n\nAs a guy who has been here for going on his 5th year and has lived here every summer, I've explored just about everything in Mt. Pleasant and I want to share what at least I think are the best things this place, so all you newbies have an idea of what to check out. \n\nEvery body knows about the casino, it's not my kind of place, but they do have some decent entertainment events if you got cash for a ticket. They also have some more upscale type places to eat, which is pretty good for a special occasion or valentine's day.\n\nMy favorite place in all of Mt. Pleasant is [ Kaya Coffee House]\n(http://kayacoffeehouse.com/) It's a coffee shop just north of campus, it's right across the street from Grawn Hall. Really good coffee and tea, good specialty drinks (I really like the Drunken Irishman) it's super chill and they do open mic night's every Wednesday. It's got all that organic/gluten free bullshit too. :)\n\n[Max and Emily's](http://www.maxandemilys.com/) is the best sandwich shop in town, their menu is written on the walls with chalk, they are a bakery too, I get their bread from time to time. Outdoor seating too. \n\n[Stan's](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Stanleys-Famous-Restaurant/107999042585138) and [The Diner](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Diner/111595875546609) are both really really good breakfast places. They honestly look a little beat up, but their service is usually good at both places. They have some weird hours at times, Stan's used to close when they ran out of food, and the Diner is off the path a little bit. \n\n[The Bird](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Bird-Bar-Grill/111552772218737?fref=ts) is probably my favorite bar in town. The crowd is a little older, upperclassman and some professors. Wayside is a fucking wreck. You have to go on a pint night once, but then you should Men In Black neuralize yourself immediately. [The Blue Gator](https://www.facebook.com/bluegator?fref=ts) and [Hunter's Ale House](https://www.facebook.com/huntersmtp?fref=ts) are pretty good bars too. \n\nAfter you get drunk, there is no better food downtown that the free Jesus Dogs, or [Dog Central](https://www.facebook.com/DogCentral.CMU?fref=ts). They are mad scientists who put anything they can on hot dogs, and it's amazing after hours of drinking. A friend of mine used to work there so I went in a lot and the people who work there are really cool.\n\nMore classy places like [Midori](https://www.facebook.com/midorimp?fref=ts) or [Mountain Town](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mountain-Town-Station/192967184054588?fref=ts) if your parents come into town and want a nice place to eat. Kind of pricey. Mountain town for steak, Midori for sushi.\n\nCatch a movie at [Celebration Cinema](https://www.facebook.com/CelebrationMtPleasant?fref=ts) or go bowling at [Riverwood](https://www.facebook.com/riverwood?fref=ts)\n\nThose are the basics. There's a bunch of parks and some on campus stuff that's pretty cool. Do go to the library, but dont get your coffee from the Java City that's in there. \n\nI hope this gives some of you at least a direction at where to go, and I hope it gives others at least validation on your opinions!",

They're everywhere and can be a great escape from campus. Some of my favorites are the trails at Chip-a-waters park that merge into Veit's woods, and the trails near Mill Pond park, where there's a small beach and you can swim in the river. Also, there's a lake around 15 minutes from Mt. Pleasant called Coldwater lake that has an awesome swimming beach and park area. ",

            "comment": "I got really high one time and just went on a googling spree about this very topic lol. What I do know is that someone was stabbed to death in the basement of the white painted house on Main Street, right in the middle of all the frat houses, I think the address is like 1002 s main or something. Additionally, in the 1940s, someone was decapitated by a dumbwaiter in Warriner hall, you should be able to find articles on this by googling. Other resources around creepy CMU happenings can be the nailhed blog(a personal favorite, he talks about the mount pleasant residential school, which was a Native American \u201creeducation\u201d school that had a number of deaths, as well as the tunnels that crisscross campus), or there is plenty of stuff if you simply Google cmich haunting.",

No one went up or down while I was there and upon inspection found no one else in the house. Mentioned it to one of my roommates and he was shocked. Apparently he had the same experience whe the only one there.",

Creeped me the heck out enough I turned all the lights on and locked my bedroom door. \n\nRoommate was gone for the weekend and in the middle of the night I woke up from a deep sleep because of what sounded like heavy footsteps in the attic. No way a little critter or the wind could have made that sound.",

Temp suddenly dropped about 10 degrees, something felt different and there was a kind of glow around us. It was subtle enough visually that I would\u2019ve written it off if my dog hadn\u2019t ran all the way home (maybe like 6 blocks). At the time I was fully convinced it was a supernatural encounter but who knows. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time outdoors in my life and have experienced cold fronts. That\u2019s definitely what it felt like mostly. The inexplicable glow is something I haven\u2019t experienced before or since. Still kind of gives me the willies.",

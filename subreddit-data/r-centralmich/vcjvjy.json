At first I thought, ehh, it's too late and I'll be, ya know, however old by the time I'm done but then I figured, that time is going to pass anyways I might as well fill it with something to make me happy.",

I never had the issues getting things done on time or showing up to class* that I did when I was 18 because I was much more of an adult and responsible by then.\n\nI know it's corny as hell, but it's never too late for this kind of thing. As long as you have a plan and execute that plan as best as you can, you'll do great.",

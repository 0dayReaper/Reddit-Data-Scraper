    "postText": "My professor in one of my classes has homework (a test essay and a worksheet) due on Monday during fall break. It\u2019s a Tuesday class in case that is important. The aim of this was to give us the weekend to do them, but I was still wondering if this is allowed? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d do anything about it since I\u2019d be worried she\u2019d change the deadline to tomorrow night but I was really curious.",

I had a few professors do this last year during our wellness days.\n\nA few people complained and the department said that due dates were fully up to the professor. They also said that while  it might be due on Monday, it did not mean you had to actually do the assignment on Monday. But since you had all weekend to do it was not really assigning homework on a wellness day.\n\nIn college, unless it is big time breaking some university rule or law, professor really have almost full control over what goes on in their classroom.",

One of my professors was telling us that we should report any faculty that make due dates during fall break to the deans of their departments. They say this because apparently making fall break a \"real break\" again post covid, is something that central is working very hard on.\n\nMight not be worth it to take any action though, I'd suggest just doing the and not worry too hard. It's more of a long weekend anyway, rather than a break.",

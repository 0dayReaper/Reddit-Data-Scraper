I think a lot depends on whether you'll be on campus or taking an online course.  The \"Prepare\" section of the [Online Learning Resource Center page](https://www.cmich.edu/global/cmuonline/about/Pages/default.aspx) has some links that are a good start.  After that, it might be easier to find answers to some more specific questions.",

(There will be signs directing you to where our table/area is located once you enter the park)\n\nInstead of grilling, we will just bring food/snacks and hang out in one of the pavilions for a little \"potluck\". Everyone is encouraged to bring something, but if you can't afford it, please don't hesitate to come anyway. I have made a google docs [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnbZt0eHqP7CdENGenRyT2RHMWhqRmc2di1INXhObHc#gid=0) for people to add their names and what they would like to bring. Things like fruit and cheese bowls, chips and dip, pop, cookies, veggie tray, mac n cheese, etc. are good ideas. Also, don't feel like you have to bring enough to feed everyone. If enough people bring things, we will have more than enough food for all of us. \n\nI'd also encourage you to bring any fun board games, card games, discs, volleyballs/basketballs/etc. or activities you might have. If someone owns [Cards Against Humanity](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/), I would love you forever for bringing that. \n\nAt 8:30 or so, we will be moving downtown (walking distance from the park) to The Bird for drinks. If you work earlier in the evening, this will be a good time/place to meet up. Those of you under 21, I'm sorry you won't be able to get in :(. But this is why we are meeting at the park as well, so everyone has a chance to come.\n\n(Sidenote: The next meetup will probably be held at Kaya in a month or so, so if you can't make it to this one or don't like the places we're going, no worries!)\n\nIf your cmu friends are redditors please make sure to let them know about this! And UPVOTE THIS SO EVERYONE CAN SEE IT :).\n\nCan't wait to see all of you on friday. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them here or PM me.\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nSep 14th\n\n7pm: Island Park; bring food n shit.\n\n8:30pm: The Bird\n\n**If it's raining, we will meet at [Kaya](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=kaya+coffee+mount+pleasant+mi&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=43.609125,-84.7807&amp;sspn=0.009881,0.022724&amp;hq=kaya+coffee&amp;hnear=Mt+Pleasant,+Isabella,+Michigan&amp;t=m&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A) instead at 7pm!!**",

I wish current and previous members the best in separating from that group.",

There has been at least 60 people who have been excommunicated or forced to leave due to unhealthy practices by the church, yet they are too afraid to go public about it. It's so scary to think that the leadership at Grace Church has done this for years and has never been held accountable. People who have left are too scared to talk publicly about it but are now using forums on Reddit and Cult Education Watch as an outlet to share their story and experiences. Some have said they are still suffering trauma years later from the manipulation and essentially brainwashing the church leadership has done to them. \n\nAmongst the tactics they've used include sleep deprivation and intensive fasting and exercise, which is insane to pressure students into given they need the energy for their studies! These tactics are used to break down resistance and cause mental confusion. You're constantly told or \"encouraged\" to repent your sins to church leadership or to Pastor Barry himself and his family members. This information is only to be used against you in moments when you (rightfully so) question their authority regarding methods that are spiritually abusive and psychologically unhealthy to its followers.\n\nThe church is extremely skilled at isolating its members from loved ones by driving wedges between recruits and their family, friends schoolwork and even past church communities they once belong to prior to attending Grace. This is especially the case for those whose loved ones vocally question the church - as they are labeled as \"evil\" or \"ungodly\". They intentionally \"love bomb\" their members so they feel a sense of \"family\" with the church to the point they are willing to give up anyone in their lives for them. This is easily effective when you're sleep deprived, hungry and cut off from anyone other than its members. I found the following quote from an article written by an ex-member of a different church organization regarding recruitment tactics they used, and this is exactly what happens at Grace too:\n\n\"Once we had a recruit, we prepared a 'conversion calendar' that scheduled every waking moment of his or her time to give that person no distance in order to evaluate what was going on,\" said Mr. Bauer, who said he was a graduate of Harvard Theological Seminary and currently pastor of a small Maryland church. \"They see parents and other religious groups as enemies who will attempt to take their converts, and their donations, away from them. \n\nThis is what happens at the early stage - so please be careful! You might not even realize whats happening to you. \n\nThe leadership at Grace Church calls themselves \"Christians\" but in reality, they use the Lord's name to divide. The tactics they employ are a textbook example of spiritual abuse. Additionally, women are constantly told to \"submit to the authority\" of the male leaders. It's disgusting. \n\nPlease try and spread the word as the community deserves to hear this story and be warned. For those that don't know, this is the same church that houses 1217 Coffee Roasters. \n\nNo student should have to go through years of suffering because of what they went through at Grace Church. And for those who have or are currently suffering because of how you were treated or manipulated into thinking, there is support!",

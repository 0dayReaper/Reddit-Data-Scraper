I helped a good amount with the children ministries and cleaning the church. I had attended public school my whole life, unlike the rest of the children there. Their families had been the ones who started the church, and decided that homeschooling would be a good shield from the sins out there. \n\nI remember when I had started to become more and more involved, I felt left out because I went to public school. The kids would treat me differently, often not talk to me at all. So I decided to give home schooling a try, and spend more time dedicating my life to God. \n\nMonths into homeschooling, I began to feel very alone and lost. Most of my time I spent at the church, but the kids my age there still would treat me differently. I had began to spend too much time involved in the church and almost no time on myself. I'd lost all of my good friends making the decision to home school, and now it seemed all I had was the church. \n\nI decided one day to approach the woman leading my children's group  (mind you she's one of the \"elders\" wives) and tell her about my ideas to quit the childrens ministry for a while and go back to public school to work on my mental health. She instantly became bitter with me, and we haven't spoken since. To this day, she continues to turn the other cheek when i see her at Easter services or Christmas eve services. She continues to make my mother feel different and left out to this day. \n\nTo the children who have grown up there, I pray for the day they become an adult and step outside into the real world. I won't go into depth with the cult-like characteristics of GC, but I do have a few things To say. If you're looking for emotional support and guidance in your faith, do not be fooled by the welcoming smiles. Things were good at first, until it became a constant competition on whose relationship with the Holy Spirit was stronger at thirteen years old. \n\nI also find my parents tithing pretty sizable checks to the church during services, and I know the main auditorium is being renovated right now, but I also know a good chunk of our donations pays for the Flanders and other founding families houses and income. \n\nIf you're not a Flanders or a founding family, you'll never fully fit in. And it's sad. \n\nEmail me if you're interesting in chatting or need support",

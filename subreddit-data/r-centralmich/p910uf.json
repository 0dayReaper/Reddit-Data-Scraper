V2 was the first go in the building across the street, and V3 was the second go. The V2 one had the hookah I think, and V3 was like 4 or 5 years ago. \n\nV3 failed because the quality wasn't consistent and people stopped going there, even though the reopening was really successful. The thing was that the reopening was Tim Otteman from RPL and his brother, but they only bought the business and not the building, and the original owners kept the building. \n\nWhatever the deal was, it allowed Kaya to move in after the owner of the old SBX building kicked everyone out to rezone and build apartments (which failed spectacularly because the town is pretty consistent about voting down those proposals near campus). \n\nThen whatever happened killed Kaya and Malt Shop again, and now both buildings are vacant eyesores on the edge of campus. So you could say everyone lost, really.",

Took up the top floor of what used to be Kaya and part of the SBX, as well as the basement directly beneath the two. The kaya portion was the diner area while the SBX portion and the basement were dedicated to gaming and pool tables. As consoles became more and more popular in the 90's they stopped getting the newest arcade machines and relied mostly on nostalgia before building across the road and moving there. \n\nThey briefly tried to resurrect the arcade and pool feeling but there was never anyone in there. In addition to the hookah lounge they also tried a generic meeting area that you could rent out. Eventually they just closed it up and started offering more and more middle-eastern food which, for the most part, was really good to me but didn't fly with the average customer. Tom, who I'm pretty sure was the only white guy who ever worked for them, stuck through it all until it was sold to the brothers you mention. \n\nThe new owners bought the recipes for the pizza (which was the god damned best pizza in history, fight me) while also turning it into an Americanized business. As far as I know, not terribly long after Kaya moved in, the new renters found a whole lot of issues with the building's maintenance. This was never able to be rectified with the owners (the old Malt Shoppe owners) and both places closed down. I tend to side with the new owners on this one as the old ones were shady as fuck. I once got accused of stuffing paper into the pool table pockets so I didn't have to pay for more than one game. For the record, i did not do this.",

I've been at CMU in some capacity since 2010.\n\nThis is a good addition, thank you. I forget the exact details of when and why v3 closed up, but I remember it being some sort of shitty situation like that.\n\nWhen the Ottemans reopened it, it was hopping for quite some time. The environment was great, food was good, prices were good. I remember there being a steady stream of CBA folks coming in regularly and hanging out for a while. \n\nThey cycled through some staff and a lot of menu options were quietly dropped until it was basically just pizza, which was fine, but the quality of the pizza started to go down and the prices started to go up. I remember a string of experiences I had going in there and them not having any of the pizza I wanted and having to wait like 30 minutes for pepperoni, so I just stopped going. I liked having a non-chain that close to campus, but it was just hard to trek across campus for food that ultimately wasn't that good anymore.",

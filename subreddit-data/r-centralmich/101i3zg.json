Of course, this is just my take.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the \u201cAction C\u201d?\n\nDo you like it or dislike it?  Could the university do something new that could be an improvement over what they have now?",

IIRC, they still use the illustrated/graphic Bronco on their helmets but added a yellow \u201cW\u201d as their official school logo.   \n\nI think the big issue is that Western was using up to 10 different logos for the school and what they should have done is phased out 9 of them and kept the best one.\n\nCMU has always been pretty good about keeping one primary logo, which was the \u201cBlock C\u201d for decades that everyone seemed to like, then the \u201cAction C\u201d which no one seems to like (based on what I\u2019ve read, heard).",

Now it is just yellow W. \n\nI have noticed you can still get plenty of gear in the old style and colors. The people who are most affected and annoyed by the rebrand is the athletes. They would much prefer the bronco over the W on their gear and swag. \n\nAt the end of the day its really a non issue and the athletics are using brown and white for many uniforms. Which I much prefer over brown and yellow.",

I had a beer with a guy with who was from the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe at Mountain Town Station two years ago and we talked about this a bit.  \n\nHe stated that he had a problem with \"tomahawk chopping\" at games, the Redskins, and caricatures of Native Americans.  Basically anything that mocks/stereotypes them. \n\nHe did not, however, have an issue with spears and feathers on the football helmets.  He said that spears are merely tools that they hunt/fish with and are a part of their \"badass\" resourceful legacy.   Feathers are sacred, but they are still worn by the tribe itself so he did not see what the issue was there.\n\nThe issue mainly comes from university leadership who made the decision to do away with Native American imagery in the late 80's.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'm a masters student at Penn State. Our bookstore messed up and didn't get in stock enough textbooks for our class (actually a simulation access code, can't be retrieved online and its stupid).\n\nAnyways, I feel dumb asking, but CMU bookstore is literally the only place it is in stock right now, and my group needs one ASAP or its going to be bad. Unfortunately I need a CMU student ID to get one. Anybody want to help a fellow student out?\n\nCheers",

    "postText": "Hello fellow Chippewas! I hope your first week back has treated you well. \n\nReddit is holding a [college meetup day](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/day/college-reddit-meetup-day/) across the globe. I think this would be a great way for you guys to meet (or re-meet for those of you that made it to our last [successful meetup](http://i.imgur.com/geiOX.jpg)), get to know each other, and possibly turn this into a semi-regular thing. \n\nWHEN: Unless a significant amount of people exclaim that they can't make it, I think we should have the meetup on **September 14th ~~or 15th~~** (fri, ~~sat~~). This should give you enough time to take work off, jot this in your calendar and make it out :). \n\nWHERE: Since quite a few of you guys are under 21, we will have to meet somewhere we can all get into. Kaya worked pretty successfully last time, so we could do that again. I think it would also be fun to head to a bar afterwards for those 21+. There's also the option of doing something like going bowling or grilling out at Island Park instead of kaya+bar. I noticed that despite how nice the last meetup was, there were definitely awkward moments of silence, and perhaps *doing something* together would help this issue. Plus, then those of us who are old enough to drink could just drink there instead of driving elsewhere for part 2. Please let me know what you think, and if you have a better place in mind.\n\nI'll be making an official post, as well as an official meetup on redditgifts soon, but wanted to get some input from all of you first. \n\nEnjoy the long weekend! And please **upvote this** so all of the subscribers can see it. (A friendly reminder: this is a self-post and therefore I won't be keeping any karma from it ;)). \n\nCheers!",

And when they are open (like they are few days a week for dinner and lunch) food has been found to be undercooked/overcooked/spoiled. And all the admin will offer is to help students change their meal plans to a cheaper plan.\n\n\r  \nCMU Life has a pretty good archive of all the articles from the past year. I'd recommend reading the one about the most recent board meeting, the one where they interview the professors and unions, and the one from last week about the food issues.",

If so are they a tenant and pay a rent to CMU?",

And the days they are open? food has been found to be undercooked, overcooked, and even spoiled. CMU life did a great article on it last week. \n\nAnd all CMU has offered is to let students change their meal plan to a cheaper option. While other colleges (who are going through the same supply chain problems) have either refunded students or given them vouchers so they can eat off campus. I no longer live in campus, but many of friend who live in the dorms have not been able to eat in the dining halls this semester. They have lost thousands of dollars\n\nI do not *think* CMU Life pays rent as they are a student style organization. But I could be wrong.",

Lots of rumors floated around that Schutten is incredibly difficult to work with, so I think she was kind of a sacrificial lamb that just happened to be beneficial anyway.",

Some faculty, staff, and departments, will get hurt in the process.",

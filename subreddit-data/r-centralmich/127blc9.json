Firstly, I know that graphic design is only under the BFA, and fashion is BAA, BA, BS. My advisor told me that I could major in both even if one doesn\u2019t show as a degree that works with the major.\n\nWhen I graduate, will my degree show both of these majors? Or will I just get two different degrees at once?",

Meaning I don\u2019t think you can double major in a BFA. I think you might need to get two degrees here. Clarify things with advisors from BOTH area. Get it in writing and then show it to your professor. \n\nIf I am correct- the best work around would be to minor in Fashion. \n\nI used to advise at CMU but not those departments- so I cant say for certain this is the case. But do ask advisors in EHS and CAM.",

None of those are an BFA. Having said that- yeah there may be work arounds. One way to find out.\n\nOP talk to your advisor. Don\u2019t rely on what you see on Reddit- and that includes my posts.",

If you don't end up double majoring, then yeah, it can't go on a BFA. \n\n\nI am getting a BFA from CMU in 5 weeks, and my second major is Art History, which is not offered on a BFA, only a BA. But because it's my second major, it can go on the BFA, and I didn't have to take two years of a language to fulfill the BA requirement. It is completely doable and I'm not some special case. \n\nTalk to advisors, but also look at the bulletin and advocate for yourself because advisors (especially general) don't know everything and might you you can't double major if it says it's not offered on that degree, because I got told that. \n\n[scroll down to additional major ](http://cmich.smartcatalogiq.com/2018-2019/Undergraduate-Bulletin/Majors-Minors-and-Certificates/Majors-and-Minors-Overview)",

Looking at my Associate's from Delta and Bachelor's from SVSU, they both fit this pattern and I believe CMU does as well. \n\nIf you're double majoring, usually one degree type will take precedence over the other. So, your degree might read that you've earned a BFA, but you've also completed a secondary major in Fashion which would be backed up by your transcripts. This is different than a dual degree, where you would earn two bachelor's degrees. by completing the requirements for both majors individually (this means if either or both require a minor, you'd be on the hook for them). This usually requires completing an additional 30cr, so you'd end up graduating with about 150cr at Central. \n\nYou should be able to confirm what your specific diploma will say by reaching out to Central's Registrar's Office, and you should be able to talk with an advisor in CLASS for assistance in the difference between double majoring and a dual degree.",

If a student wanted to get a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, but also wanted to get a second degree, say a Bachelor of Science in Public Health - Health Administration, some requirements would be shared. A student would need to finish our Basic Skills and General Education requirements (our version of CMU's Competencies and UP's) and have at least 42cr at the 300-400 level. They would then need to finish the requirements for both individual majors, which for us, both require minors. So long as all of those requirements are complete and the student has at least 155cr, they'd graduate with both degrees (a BA in PSYC and a BS in Public Health - Health Administration). \n\nCompare that to a student who is doing a BA in Psychology, and wants to have second major in Public Health - Health Administration. Instead of needing to finish the requirements of a dual degree which would consist of a minor for both majors, they just need to finish the major requirements. So, the second student would graduate with a BA in PSYC with a secondary major in Public Health - Health Admin. \n\nLike others have mentioned, I would strongly suggest speaking with your academic advisor (and advisors for both programs) and the Registrar's Office at CMU to get some clarification on what the best path for you would be.",

I have a second major in Art History (which is BA) but my primary major is a studio art BFA, and I will be getting a single BFA degree conferred in May. \n\nUltimately, talk to an advisor, but from my experience, the only way to get two degrees (instead of the double major on a single one) is for the registrar's office to do some stuff to your degree progress. \n\nWhat does your degree progress say? If you have one tab with your majors, you're getting one degree. If you have two tabs, two degrees.\n\nIt's like someone else said though, you'll be required to meet all the extra requirements for the fashion degree. If you do a BFA + BAA, you'll have to have a minor for the BAA. \n\n(source, current double major student, at one point I did have two degrees because my advisor fucked me over)",

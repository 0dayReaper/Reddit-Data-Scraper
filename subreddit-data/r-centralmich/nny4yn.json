Most recently this has been a Minecraft community, but we've also had things like college football sim leagues, discord communities, and other similar stuff asking if any Central students are interested in joining. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a moderator I tend to remove them unless they specifically ask permission first, and usually when they ask permission I tell them that people are generally not interested. But in the interest of data-based decision making, let me know if this is something you actually want to see in this community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nny4yn)",

No one utilizes this subreddit anyway. \n\nThe point is largely moot, but I'd rather not alienate the few people that do check in often by either having overly strict moderation or allowing fundamentally off-topic content that drives them away.\n\nSo, I asked how folks felt. Personally, I don't want to see \"hey fellow college students, please check out my cool Minecraft community with lots of other universities\", but I am fine with \"hey, Tech Services started this Minecraft server for other CMU students to play\". One is targeted advertising to a generic demographic, the other is an invitation sent to a community. It might be a fine line, but it's one I personally see value in drawing.\n\nUltimately I made the poll to be transparent about what it is I'm doing.\n\n&gt;Make a generic thread and pin it to allow people to comment different communities if needed.\n\nThis completely misses the point because it fails to address the problem and then just convolutes it as a solution. I'd either just flat allow or flat remove the content.",

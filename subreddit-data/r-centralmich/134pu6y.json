    "postText": "Disclaimer: For undergraduates or alumni reading this, I would encourage reading more about graduate school to see how faculty expect it to be a full time job. I am posting this since I felt a need to let incoming students know about department priorities.\n\nI enrolled in my Ph.D program after my previous Master's in Fall 2020, fresh off of the COVID debacle. My class was on the larger side since the university specifically said they wanted more students than other classes that came before me (ironic in hindsight). Letters and offers were sent out roughly a month before stay-at-home orders were implemented, so I secured my tuition waiver and stipend via graduate assistantship at that point.\n\nHowever, after my first year, funding was completely cut for Ph.D students (Master's students can get assistantships, not tuition waivers) for the incoming first-year students in the 2021-2022 year. As of this academic year, no funding for first years is still in place but my stipend cut got in *half.* The graduate student bargaining agreement, even though the graduate student union disbanded years ago, is still in effect and had a provision so I secured another gig to build my CV if my hours were ever cut at all.\n\nEver since I enrolled, *all* Psychology departments have had to worry about no funding for *all* of their graduate students in future years. Even when I met with officials at the university and mentioned that I was verbally told my funding was for 4 years, I was met with pushback since they only told me that the university could grant funding for what will be my 4th year in 2023-2024 if my offer letter *specifically* stated it would be 4 years (it didn't). There is massive divisiveness amongst different Psychology graduate programs about which program will get more money even though *everyone was hit by the budget cuts in some capacity.* Why would it matter who is getting more if everyone is getting less?\n\nUnfortunately, CMU is in a huge bind since not admitting any new Master's or Ph.D students means CMU will speed up the budget cuts more than they already have compared to other regional institutions in the state of Michigan. If a CMU official is reading this, I hope they do not use this post to do more damage to students than you already have at this point by cutting their funding. I hope they have a plan for pre-existing students to finish out their programs *with* the remainder of their funding since the possibility of a student paying for a Ph.D with the looming risk of budget cuts year to year has taken a massive mental toll on everyone! Do not blame the department for this either since all Psychology faculty are trying, but its the Deans and Provost who control how much the department gives to students and how much they are allowed to pay their own faculty, not the department itself. Unbelievable.",

            "comment": "I am an actuary and CMU grad. I recommend branching out beyond simply an Act Sci major - to be honest AS degrees are code for \u201ccoached to pass exams\u201d and not helpful.  It can still get your foot in the door but I see those resumes and think, \u201cWell\u2026 we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nI recommend stats, math, or comp Sci to round you out both for future employers and in case you end up not liking AS. \n\nI personally did AS/Math/Stats as a triple major, which at least in my time wasn\u2019t THAT insane with clever double and triple counting of some classes. It ended up being similar to 1.75 or 2 majors with little double-counting. Still much harder than 1 major.\n\nAlso recommend you take basic classes like English that you need at a community college, just be sure to triple check they will transfer the credit. You won\u2019t learn anything different for a fraction of the price. \n\nYou will never use FORTRAN as an actuary but it is a simple programming class. (If still even taught.) I recommend for your benefit you focus more on SAS, Python, and/or R. Also just basic Excel skills, but you will learn this on the fly anyway when you start work. VBA, if there is any class on it, is good too. \n\nTake your exams ASAP. They are not like a final exam, unless your final exams are taking you 200-400 hours of study. Knocking out at least P and FM (1 and 2 for CAS terminology) before graduating will do you a world of good. Personally the prep class they had for CMU was terrible and I ended up studying for 12 hours per day for 14 days, after the prep class, and barely passed. \n\nFor P you will greatly benefit from some math stats classes first. Mid-level calculus and probability distributions. FM, for me, felt it required less prior prep.\n\nAMA.",

For sure ill be doing the certification and i will also look into possibilities of double major. If at all i dont like AS i'd like to switch to accounting",

It\u2019s been too long since I graduated to tell you details on that. However, find a\u2026 guidance counselor?\u2026 I forget the proper term, and get their assistance for any kind of double major double counting advice. \n\nAlso, visit that counselor more than 1 time as I have seen some fuck things up by being wrong. \n\nThere are \u201cmajor\u201d schools for AS that are considered \u201cbetter\u201d than CMU, but honestly I would never care on a resume. Maybe if I saw you went purely to community college I\u2019d think \u201cHm interesting, well perhaps this can work out but that\u2019s odd.\u201d\n\nSame for accounting. \n\nFYI especially as you are international, CMU has tutors available that I believe are completely free. If you have a language barrier that might be particularly helpful for you. I tutored ECON and ACC and several of my students were foreign and just had a harder time picking things up.",

Just to coach you, \u201ccertification\u201d sounds like \u201chaha that took me a whole week of evenings\u201d, the exams are FUCKING. ROUGH. Employers will tilt their heads in confusion at that verbiage. We might be a bit touchy across the industry but I have had family say \u201cgood luck on the quiz today!\u201d after I sacrificed months and it\u2019s a little, yikes.  \n\nI am probably a career ACAS at this point due to hundreds of hours put in and 3 fails over 2 years at the higher level ones which get harder. \n\nI would rather take the 3 accounting exams twice than go through what I\u2019ve done to date. However I don\u2019t regret it a bit, only regret doing it a bit too late. Good QOL career.",

Might be worth taking a course related to each in your first semester and see what interests you more. (Albeit, little of what you learn in college will be helpful as an Actuary, if I\u2019m being honest.)",

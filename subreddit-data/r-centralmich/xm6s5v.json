It would help me a lot if you could talk about the pros and cons of the BFA studio art there.\n\nAlso, is it possible to transfer after the 1st year or 2?

They are all practicing artists, which is great. They are all very committed to their students, at least two of them have been around cmu for 20 years, they are dedicated. \n\nThe facilities are really nice. We used to have a mfa program, so there's still a lot of facilities from that. We also have a fair amount of events and talks that are fun to attend @and listen to practicing artists. \n\nBFA students have access to their own shared studio, only studio bfa students get access so that's really nice. As a bfa student you are required to participate in a few faculty critiques a semester. Sounds scarier than it is. They just talk to you about your work, see what you want to do and what you want to make. \n\nGenerally it's a 3 semester program, but I would start it as soon as you can, as being in it for more semesters just gives you more feedback and experience. \n\nOne of the biggest cons is it is a smaller department and we have one professor teaching each media, generally. That's also a nice pro though, in my opinion, as the professors will know you, know your name, know what kind of art you make and want to make. I've had professors send me info for shows and residencies that I wouldn't have found out about otherwise, so those personal relationships are great to build. I'm not currently looking at grad schools but any of my professors would write me a glowing letter of recommendation in a heartbeat because they know me. \n\nTransferring in shouldn't be a problem, if that's what you mean. One of my really good bfa friends came to cmu with her associates already and had zero problems getting her degree.\n\nUnfortunately, cmu does have declining enrollment, but I think we are going up again, and the bfa program is not at risk of being cut.\n\nI know that's a lot of text and a lot of information, but I really love the program and joining it was one of the best parts of my college experience.\n\nEdit: I'll also be happy to answer more questions! Now or later :)",

I think I'll accept it if they send me an acceptance letter. \n\nIs it safe to assume that rarely any CMU BFA Studio Art posts are made or talked about online because of the department's size? \n\nAlso, I wanted to know if transferring from CMU after completing 1/2 years to a different place maybe is common. Is the transfer process smooth or does it take time? *(In my country it's lengthy and colleges are rude to students who wish to transfer)*\n\nI've read articles about some past CMU students who were removed from courses without properly informing them. I've also seen many students complain about how the administration does not listen to their needs. Makes me a bit anxious, now. \n\nxx",

And not a whole ton of the other studio art degree either. Generally it's just a smaller department and smaller majors.\n\nI can't help with transferring out. That's not something I've done or had any familiarity with.\n\nThe administration isn't the best, there's a whole lot more they could be doing for the students, but from a student perspective, they don't seem to really affect my day to day life. But other people might have had different experiences, it's not a one size fits all experience.",

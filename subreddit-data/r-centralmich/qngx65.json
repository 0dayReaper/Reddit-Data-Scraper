    "postText": "Hello All, \nThis week I had a professor who did not show up to class, they also did not send out an email or post on blackboard that class was canceled. They are usually very punctual and professional, so this is very out of the ordinary, however, this had occurred once before and the professor had thought they posted that class would be canceled, but hadn\u2019t. They followed up shortly after class with an email explaining and apologizing for the situation. This time, they have been radio silent, which seems very unusual. I\u2019m wondering if it would be inappropriate for me to reach out via email? If a friend had missed out on class unexpectedly, I would more than likely check in to make sure they are okay- but, a professor and student have a very different dynamic. I also feel that in a sense it is none of my business, so I have very mixed emotions on the appropriate way to  procede, and I am looking for others opinions. Thank you for taking the time to read this!",

I see your point of contacting the Dean so that a proper check can be performed.

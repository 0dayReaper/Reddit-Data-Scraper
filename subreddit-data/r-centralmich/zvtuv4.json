I don\u2019t need a crazy party scene but as long as the social scene makes it easy to meet people I\u2019m happy. Thanks!",

College is expensive and you need to show the initiative and get your money\u2019s worth.\n\nI attended CMU for a year and a half before transferring to MSU for major switch, but my professors at CMU were excellent.",

I will probably get some shit for this, but I really enjoyed Greek life (after entering school with no plans to ever do that).  I had my fraternity but was friends with guys in other fraternities and in the sororities.  I also found it very easy to make friends living in the dorms. \n\nIf you would like to ask any specific questions happy to chat via DM.",

There are plenty of student organizations and events that go on on campus; Greek life is fairly small in comparison to places down south, but it\u2019s definitely worth checking out. As someone else mentioned, I wasn\u2019t super big into the idea of Greek life until I met with the sororities on campus and got to see the people in them. Definitely look to the smaller chapters who have more diverse groups of people in them if you\u2019re not looking for drama. \n\nI will, however, say that Mount Pleasant can be SO boring. You need to find hobbies and things that interest you if you don\u2019t have a vehicle to leave town. \n\nMidland has a baseball team, Lansing is only an hour or so away, so it\u2019s not terrible but the only real off campus entertainment is the casino. \n\nIf you\u2019re not white, be wary of some of the people on and off of campus. As a BIPOC student I definitely had my fair share of run ins with people who weren\u2019t the friendliest, but I found a great group of friends who I was able to be my true self with. \n\nAs others have mentioned, get involved with the professors in your department. They, for the most part, are amazing humans who are trying their best to put you in the best situation to succeed.",

It\u2019s a decent school, but idk that I trust the program now that they\u2019ve combined it with the broadcast and cinematic arts program. BCA has been trying to cannibalize the JRN program since before I started as a student. And the JRN program had a fair bit of turnover since my time. Most of the professors that I had aren\u2019t even there anymore because of the culture within the program. \n\nI know I\u2019m going to get shit for this next paragraph, but you need to know: Just as a reality check if you\u2019re BIPOC, you may have a harder time there. There have been several well-documented cases of blatant racism occurring on campus in the past few years alone. And when I was a student, I had several people tell me they chose CMU because it didn\u2019t have the diversity of other schools further south in Michigan. There are OK resources for BIPOC students, but racism on campus lacks follow through from administrators to really stomp it out. \n\nFeel free to DM me if you have specific questions, too.",

People are racist toward them all the time, and most of it is micro aggressions when you\u2019re on campus. \n\nAnd I know I\u2019ll get shit for this, but using the Chippewa name itself is a micro aggression. I understand CMU has an agreement with the tribe in Mount Pleasant, but that doesn\u2019t cover every other Ojibwa nation out there (and there are a ton in the Great Lakes region). The name was also established in the 1980s, and we have certainly come a long way in understanding the pain and suffering that white people inflicted on our Indigenous neighbors. Like, the fact that there\u2019s an actual industrial boarding school right down the road should speak volumes for removing the name and honoring the hundreds of children who died two miles from campus.",

Save some money if you're buying in bulk. \n\n-Going grocery shopping at walmart during busy shopping hours? Park on the right side of the building and walk in through the auto shop. Continue shopping and leave the same way you came -\nthere's a 'hidden' register that's always operated and there's hardly ever anyone in line. \nChecking out is always a lot easier and quicker. \n\n-You can usually find a few of your required textbooks at the library. Even better? You can renew books online. \n\n-Celebration Cinema has $4 movies every Sunday. \n\n**-Get an audit as soon as possible. Even if you think you don't need one, get one. They only take 10-15 minutes, so do it! If you've already got one, it wouldn't hurt to get another - epically if you're close to graduation! If it's your first time, go to Warner Hall and find the under graduate student service office. It's not uncommon to book many months in advance (walk in Sept., soonest appointment available is Feb.) so make sure to get in early!**\n\nI know you guys have a ton of these, open to all suggestions and comments on the ones posted already.

This doors leads to maintenance shafts under every building, the famous \"tunnels\". While some of them are tall enough to walk through, you will need to duck around most of them. They all link together to every building.\n\nBy the football stadium, there is a plaque that states nuclear waste is buried under this area.\n\nThe basement of Sloan Hall is the creepiest place in the world...tiny hallways, odd sounds, the fear of someone watching you...\n\n**Edit** Forgot about the abandoned Insane Asylum in Mt. Pleasant. Used to be an Indian Boarding School. Broke into that place about 4 times my freshmen year. Incredibly spooky but lots of fun.",

And I used to live in Polo so I know they only check in the morning around 7 plus even if they were to catch you they give you a warning before they tow your car.  \n\nIn case you haven't ventured to the 4th floor of the library they have dual-monitor computers. \n\nIf you are in the mood to get pissed, I suggest attending or watching CMU football. \n\nAs far as uncommon knowledge, ~~well this is more like an urban legend~~ I heard from a friend who I trust ~~but have no other evidence to support~~, Back when we were worried about getting bombed the plan was that if Lansing were to be bombed. Warriner Hall would serve as the backup capitol. Think about it. Geographically center of the state. Was equipped with a bomb shelter. Has an auditorium. Has a lot of office space. Hypothetically, far enough away from  Lansing to not get hit by said bombs. Middle of nowhere with low population unlike Ann Arbor. Even if you're like nawww no way that's true, I urge you to try looking at Warriner Hall the same again.  \n \nEdit: shawnvalin found evidence for the backup capitol story being true. Link in his comment. Upvote him for some solid research. ",

However, audits are only schedule a month in advance. Therefore, because all of November is packed, you have to wait until November 1st to go in and schedule one (for December). So don't really waste your time going to the office until the beginning of November.  \n\nAlso, though my memory is super blurry on this, there's a really cool little hang out spot above the music building's main concert hall. Maybe someone else knows what I'm talking about and can give more details?",

Correct me if I'm wrong folks, but here's what I've been told -\n\n\nA college audit is in reference to a meeting you have with an adviser (or someone you're appointed to who knows the game) usually after your second or third year. In this meeting, you go over all the classes you've taken and the classes you need to take in order to graduate, along with all the little requirements (and sometimes rather large ones too) that nobody ever tells you about. If my memory serves me correctly you must have at least two audits before you graduate, one 'main' one and one minor audit right before you graduate (normally done through mail, someone correct me if I'm wrong). Basically they sit you down and make sure your grades are high enough, you've taken the correct UC's and all your degree requirements are taken care of. It's really helpful and you can have an audit done as many times as you'd like. I almost wish they made it a requirement to have one done every year. \n\n\nThe usual slip-ups happen throughout various situations\n\n\n1. Students transferring community college credits over end up not getting credit for said classes\n2. Not enough 300 level and above class credit\n3. Forgetting about their general math/speech/English requirements (or so I was told) \n4. Bulletin changes.\"Surprise! we're not offering that class anymore, you're going to have to get a degree modification\" (not that big of a deal if you know about it, but it can be a shock if you're not informed a class you need to take isn't being offered anymore. This sort of thing really depends on your major/minor)\n5. Seasonal class scheduling/classes that are only offered in the fall or spring type of deal. \n6. Transfer students from another school. [This link](http://go.cmich.edu/academic_programs/undergraduate/transfer/Pages/What-Will-Transfer.aspx) is really helpful. \n\n\nYour best bet is to talk with professors in your department and your official adviser/audit friend. Don't take advice from students on what classes you need to graduate. At the end of the day the only thing standing between you and your degree is that final audit, not the advice from a senior in your field. \n\n\nObviously you should take most of this advice with a grain of salt, because I am too a student. Personally I wish someone would have informed me about this stuff before I was circling the drain, if you catch the drift. One the other side of things most students never run into any issues and walk out in four years, no issues. But for the majority it seems like the sooner you get involved with figuring it all out, the better. Best of luck and remember - Central's primary objective has nothing to do with getting you that piece of paper, so you need to go figure stuff out yourself if you're hoping to finish close to on time. \n\n**EDIT: TLDR: Meet with an adviser type person, figure out exactly what you need to do to graduate. You can only get an audit after you officially sign your major/minor. You can get one if you just have your major signed, but it's obviously not recommended. Lots of people forget things or get screwed for not paying attention to details. Don't be one of those people.** ",

And, I suppose, technically, you're not *required* to get an audit, as one automatically happens when you apply for graduation (BTW, **Don't forget to apply for graduation.**). If you like living on the edge, you can wait for that and be in for a big surprise a few weeks into your ~~final~~ second to last semester.\n\nAlso, the auditors sometimes get stuff wrong, so it's best to meet with the chair of the dept. your major(s)/minors(s) happen to be in to double check special circumstances/requirements. Beware of the phrase 'electives must be selected in coordination and approved by an adviser.' (*I speak from experience*) \n\nFinally, get this done early! If you sign your major in September, on October 1, schedule an audit. If you sign a minor, same thing...if you plan on changing something--get an audit. Also, if you have extra questions after the audit, emailing the adviser usually yields pretty good results.",

They dwindled in membership and eventually lost their RSO status, but then last I heard (granting this was over a year ago, sometime before COVID) they were supposedly going to start up again.  Unfortunately I don't have any current contact info for them.",

Even spent three years on their board of trustees because they truly take you as you are. It does sound culty lol, but they\u2019re the only group I\u2019ve ever experienced that actually puts action behind their words. \nUufcm.org \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\u262e\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f",

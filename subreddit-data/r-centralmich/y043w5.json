            "comment": "I just changed my major to cybersecurity at CMU! I am a freshman this year and It is a new program that started this fall so there is no information on it on the CMU website, however, I spoke with the computer science department's chairperson and she explained everything and all the courses required for the major. It is very similar to the computer science one so if later on you decide you want to do computer science, it won't really be much of a change. It does sound like a fun major, though. There is also a cybersecurity club at CMU where you can learn more about the field.",

                            "comment": "The major requires 27 credit hours of Computer Science core classes and 18 credit hours of cybersecurity core classes which are the following:\n\nIntro to computer security and cryptography, network security, social engineering, cybersecurity law policy and ethics, hardware security, software, database, and operating system security, security informatics: Al and visualization. There are also some cybersecurity management courses you can take such as cybersecurity analysis, governance, risk, and compliance in cybersecurity, cybercrime forensics, and lastly, managing security and privacy in the Cloud. \n\nI guess what I was trying to say is that it does give you a strong foundation in computer science along with the cybersecurity classes you will take which I think is very important. There are 4 math classes you are required to take which are calculus 1, discrete math, linear algebra &amp; matrix theory, and elementary number theory so if you don't like math then I guess I would not recommend CMU for this major, however, if you don't mind math like me then I think CMU would be a good fit.",

CS/IT school does have some courses in Cyber as well. \n\nNo degree from what I know though. It is all concentrations/minor/certificates. \n\nTbh getting the cheapest computer-based degree is going to be your best bet with a Security+ certification.",

We have one of the best business programs here in Michigan, and the professors for BIS are amazing. Some of the best professors here - coming from and information systems major lol",

            "comment": "It is an excellent program. I am finishing my masters in information systems with a focus in cybersecurity at CMU. The professors are all incredibly knowledgeable, organized, and want to see you succeed. Classes were a mixture of undergrad and graduate students. Graduate students would have one or two more tasks to complete. IMO, you will learn everything you need to at CMU, in a quality environment. \n\nHere are the classes I took: \n\nCore: information systems, communication in professional contexts, application development (python), systems analysis and design, database management (SQL), project management fundamentals. \n\nCyber: Cybersecurity Analysis (Kali linux and other tools), Cybercrime Forensics (hardware, filesystem structure, more tools), Managing privacy and security in the cloud, governance/risk/compliance in cybersecurity. \n\nI hope this helps. Best of luck!",

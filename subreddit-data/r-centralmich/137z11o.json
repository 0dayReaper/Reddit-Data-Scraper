    "postText": "Hello, me and my roommate were interested in applying for Cobb dorm as freshmen this fall. From my understanding, Cobb is available to those in Living Learning Communities as well as normal students. Applications for Cobb are on June 14th. Does anyone know if this dorm is hard to get into or is there a lot of competition around it? \n\nThe only thing is i'm worried if we dont get into Cobb, then we'll have to have a 4 person suite, and we dont have 2 other roommates picked out so we'll be stuck with randos. Would it be better just to get the 4 person suite instead and find 2 other roommates?",

I know a lot of freshmen want Kulhavi hall for the single rooms, but I was just wondering if the 2 bedroom suites had the same competition around them. Applications are suppose to open at 9am on June 14th. I guess if I apply right when they open, i'll have a good chance at getting the room?",

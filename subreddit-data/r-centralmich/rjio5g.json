The other huge building used to be a place called 'SBX bookstore'. Attached to that was also the most amazing coffee shop ever (rip kaya).\n\nI've heard different things over the years, and I may be wrong about this, but I think the owners want an absurd amount of money to rent there, or they were trying to rezone that to build more housing.\n\nI'm just realizing those buildings have been empty just about as long as enrollment has been declining at CMU.",

I can\u2019t tell you how many times I drove home while eating pizza. The SBX or Student Book Exchange (the bigger building) was a way to get cheapish books  and materials. Essentially an slightly less expensive alternative to the campus bookstore.",

I scanned through Grand Valleys subbreddit regarding it's CS program and it had a bunch of posts about the program, however, there were not any recent postings for Central on this subreddit. So I was hoping that some people have any opinions on the CS program at Central?",

Part of the reason they teach Java/Eclipse is because Ford uses it.\n\nAside from one professor that every other grad knows who I'm talking about, I liked the faculty in the CS department. Gandy and Kinnicutt in particular were all super helpful even when I wasn't the best student.\n\nEnd of the day, the programs at both schools aren't world class nor are they totally worthless. I would decide based on other aspects of the school before the program.",

But again the worse teacher/professor/instructor that I\u2019ve had in my whole life was apart of the program.    \n    \nI am currently working in the CS field and have been using a lot of what was taught, specifically because I work with Java which they use to teach programming concepts at CMU. Grand Valley may have a better surrounding areas to find employment/internships.     \n    \nThere is nothing wrong with either program and will most likely leave you in the same position opportunity and skills wise. I would recommend you to choose based on whichever is the cheaper school to attend.",

Courses are laid out in a strange way. All tests open book so literally everyone is just cheating on them (fine if you just want the path of least resistance, you will learn much less and won't get as much value out of your education this way), employers will see it as an average to below-average school when job hunting. \n\nLike the capstone projects are 80% shitty Unity games that are completely worthless on a resume, it's insane to me that they allow that to be the case. \n\nIMO it's hard to flunk out of the program, especially now with this \"hyflex\" class schedule that they offer (basically means all tests are online and openbook) and for me personally, if I'm paying the price of a premium education experience, I'm going to want to obtain that experience and CMU will NOT do that for you in the comp sci program. On top of that, Mt. Pleasant is extraordinarily mid. \n\nIf I were you I'd find a school that was primarily focused on their STEM department and in particular their CS program, even if it isn't the \"sexiest\" campus or there aren't a lot of people or whatever else. At the end of the day you're paying a ton of money for this and should be looking to get as much value as possible out of it.\n\nJust one former graduate's opinion though, so take it how you will. I don't have many good things to say about the program besides that it's probably one of the easiest ones to finish if you just want a CS degree with the path of least resistance.\n\nGood luck, and feel free to DM if you want me to go into any more detail.",

Looking back, I wish I would have went to a community college and saved 15 grand, but my family didn't know any better as I was a first gen grad. \n\nBut if you're really set on a university I'd steer clear of CMU. I'm not too familiar with GV, but I know there are schools in MI with better CS programs than CMU. \n\nI was lucky enough to land a job during my final year of school, but I know many people who I graduated with that are struggling to find work because they weren't properly equipped to compete in the job market. Is this CMU's fault? Kinda. They do have job fairs and you'd probably be able to get an internship at Auto Owners or Ford if you have a good GPA and have some decent projects, but I'm sure that they also look at other schools in the area aswell, not just CMU.\n\nGood luck!",

Everyone's cheating on every test, especially with hybrid classes lol. You don't have to take Calc II. The professors (that I've had at least) are very giving. \n\nCentral's campus is dying though, if living here matters to you. Enrollment rates are super down, professors are leaving. A really good CS professor recently left too.\n\nI will say that it's a relatively safe space for queer students. We're the best university in Michigan in that regard.",

    "postText": "Hey guys,\nI am going into my junior year of information systems and had a really tough time finding an internship for this summer so I am continuing my retail job. I am worried this will be a continuous trend and would like to hear others outcomes. How hard was it for you to find an internship and what is your title. Also how long did it take graduates of the program to find jobs after graduating?\nThanks in advance!",

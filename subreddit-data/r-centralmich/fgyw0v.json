College students arent exactly known for their....um...cleanliness, so I think CMU should be really proactive is making sure returning students, especially those who traveled at all, are not spreading germs.  Professors should forgo physical assignments ( when I was a GA I got sick so often from handling papers/textbooks/close proximity to students). While the students arent the demographic that is at high risk, a lot of our professors are older.",

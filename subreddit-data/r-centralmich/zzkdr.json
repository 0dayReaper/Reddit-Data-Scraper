    "postText": "Unless you've been living under a rock, ya'll have probably seen Saj1jr's post on /r/AskReddit about our meetup we had last week. \n\n\nYes, he was talking about our meetup last friday. [Here's his description](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zytkn/went_to_my_first_reddit_meetup_on_friday_it_was_a/c68w27z) \n\n\nIf you weren't at the meetup, as one of the co-founders of this subreddit and an attendee - I can confirm that [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zytkn/went_to_my_first_reddit_meetup_on_friday_it_was_a/) was indeed talking about our little gathering on the 14th of September (at the Bird, Bar and Grill). \n\n\nWhat we're going to touch basis on right now however, is a thing most of you probably know and understand: Transparency. \n\n\nA long time ago when the internet was getting started, there was great debate about how people would create online presence. Should we use our real names? Maybe identify individuals through their IP address? Something completely different? Regardless this debate still follows the internet to this day. Anyways, I digress. \n\n\nThe bottom line is, Reddit is a rather large site. I know we all like to think of it as a secret club that only select individuals know about, but just remember that even the slightest slip of information on this website can lead to monstrous results - many not favorable in anyone's advantage. \n\n\nAs someone who has moderated global communities on various websites, I would urge you all to keep your identities a secret. Don't slip information to a large audience, especially if you don't know half of them. A prime example of giving unnecessary information would be using your global ID as your reddit name. An easy way to get traced to your full real name. Not good!\n\n\n**On the other side of this coin, please continue to contribute on our subreddit- ask questions, give advice, answer posts, contribute!** Point out things people may not have noticed/recognized. I love hopping onto our page and seeing a plethora of new content. It means a lot to me, and reminds me that there are people living in the area that aren't your average moes, who sit around and play Call of Duty and try really hard to 'not act awkward.' \n\n\nAnyways, I would urge you all to remember to have fun, and that college shouldn't be all about getting good grades and making first impressions all the time. If there's any time or place to screw up and really learn from your mistakes, it's right now - where chances are you probably won't be in the next 5 years. I don't remember half the shit I did my freshman year, and there's a good chance you won't either. (Note: this is in no reference to alcohol consumption)\n\n\nFor those of you who had a fun time at either of the meetups, I would urge you to come again to our next scheduled gathering and bring a friend or roommate! It's nice to meet ya'll here at Centralmich and we hope you are encouraged to hang out with other local redditors - I swear we aren't all weird and awkward! As moderators of Centralmich we personally advocate to be yourself no matter if you're in class, at a fraternity or sorority, hanging out with friends or anything else. If anybody tries to tell you differently, tell em to suck it. \n\n\nHave a great semester, hope to hang out again soon\n\n\n\n*-Heyvandy*\n\n\n\n**TLDR: Penis.**\n",

It's certainly more amicable than, say, getting shitfaced and punching someone in the face for no apparent reason.)...either way, if all but one person had a good time, I'd look at the meetup as a success. It's too bad I couldn't make it...",

If anyone sees it up again, please report it for the mods to see, so it can be taken down asap. Thanks :).",

Maybe I'm wrong? \n\nEither way though there really wasn't a lot of drama, but I think this whole incident reinforces the fact that the hosts/leaders need to do a better job finding ways to include everyone in whatever activities we're attempting. \n\nI like the idea of doing multiple activities at the same time so the people who want to do certain things don't isolate others who are more on the lines of chilling. Currently hatching up a plan at the moment, but I'm thinking we host the next meetup at my house. ",

Also, what usually happens when there are multiple activities is people form little cliques and don't get to know everyone at the gettogether, or if they bring their friends along, just talk to them the whole time instead of branching out. \n\nI agree that the next one will be more mindful of people's differences (and therefore won't have Cards Against Humanity) but as to how we will incorporate that will be a bit of a challenge. I'll look into how other meetups are being hosted and brainstorm. ",

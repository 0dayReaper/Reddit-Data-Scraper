It also seems like it would be easier for me to switch my major if I went to cmu. Im planning on touring campus soon and talking with some advisors but if anyone chose cmu over msu and wants to share why I\u2019d really appreciate it!!",

The ones like the new Towers and Fabiano are pretty solid. I lived in towers my first two years and it was fine. Had a few friends stay in Celani and they liked it. \n\nAt the moment (or for the last year), the dining halls have been pretty bad to the point students have been ordering doordash every day since September due to there being no food, the halls being closed, and spoiled/rotten food being left out.  I don't mean to scare you off or anything, but there are quite a few problems admissions/tour guides aren't going to bring up lol",

Living expenses are far cheaper in Mount Pleasant than they are in the Lansing area (at least they were when I still lived in the state). \n\nEast Lansing is a far more interesting place to live though. There's such a broad spectrum of people, restaurants, and music that Mount Pleasant doesn't have. Plus, the MSU campus is gorgeous. I'd often just walk through it if it was a nice day and I had some free time. \n\nI enjoyed my time at CMU and made some lifelong friends there, and your major/specialization may impact this decision, but if you can go to MSU then you should probably go to MSU.",

MSU has more options and likely better resources on average.",

I still would choose cmu but also if you are a new student/freshman living in the dorms, the food is the worst its ever been and they aren\u2019t really doing anything to help people get food. They gave people $250 more to spend on campus but that probably only lasts a week at most if you\u2019re getting breakfast lunch and dinner. Other than the food situation, everything else is great! The professors are awesome, pretty much all majors are very hands on and you have to volunteer a lot! The people are great and the class sizes are decent compared to state! Not too big but not too small!",

            "comment": "If you want my truthful opinion as a current CMU student, I would go to MSU\n\nIn my personal opinion, the cost of tuition at CMU ( and it's only going up) is nowhere near worth what you actually get out of the university in 2022. At the moment: programs are being cut or gutted (even when the admin promises they won't be), student services are being cut, staff/beloved professors are being let go at a high rate and those who aren't being forced out are leaving for better jobs (often at MSU), the pandemic killed what was left of campus culture, Mount Pleasent the city is very inactive (most people drive to Lansing/Grand Rapids for fun), a huge amount of problems with the dorms and dining halls that administration refuses to even acknowledge, price of living is slowly going up, and just overall the administration is a major mess and it doesn't look like it's going to get better any time soon.\n\nThere are a handful of programs that are still doing well, but in my opinion, there are a lot of pieces that make a school \"good\" or  \"right for you\".\n\nIf you have any specific questions, please feel free to ask\n\nEdit\n\nHonestly, not sure why the downvote. It's fine if you love or just like CMU. But I'm not going to lie about what my and my classmate's experience has been. CMU has gone through someone drastic changes since the mid-2000s and incoming students really do need to know about them.",

The quality in education is VAST. As gigiro mentioned, program qualities are decreasing at a rapid rate. Students don't seem engaged. There are great professors but a lot of them seem burned out or don't seem to care. The campus life? There really isn't any. I'm not sure if this is the effect of the pandemic and that's what I transferred into, but it's just not pleasant right now on campus. I am doing well in my classes, but I just don't feel like I'm getting the return on my $ that I would get elsewhere like MSU or U of M.",

I am almost done with my MBA (2 classes left this semester) and I did it all online. \n\nI had a really positive experience though and felt that the classes were a decent challenge and the professors were knowledgeable and helpful for the most part.   I would do it again.  \n\nMount Pleasant is somewhat small, but Grand Rapids or Detroit are only about 2 hours away",

Look no further than the NZCFL, an 120-team college football simulation league, where Central Michigan is open! The NZCFL offers a unique combination of a realistic coaching and recruiting experience with flexibility in its time requirements. Our recruiting system, designed to emulate the real-life football recruiting process, allows you to put in as much time as you want to on the process while still allowing you to sign a program-changing class. If you\u2019re looking for that more casual experience, it\u2019s easy to get the process knocked out in one sitting, but you\u2019ll still be able to go even farther if you\u2019re able to put the time in. That\u2019s what makes this league such a great experience -- you\u2019re in control. You have the ability to build a legacy and leave a lasting impact on these teams. Come join us by claiming a team in the Reddit reservation thread and joining the server!

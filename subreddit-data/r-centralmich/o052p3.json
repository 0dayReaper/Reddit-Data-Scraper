    "postText": "I took drivers training back in high school, but despite passing the written test and taking the road test 1 time (which I failed pretty quickly tbh), I never had many chances to actually drive on the roads due to not having anyone who was able/willing to help me.\n\nDue to Michigan being a very car-dependent state, living off-campus for the first time, and not wanting to rely on family anymore, I know I need to get my license. But it has been over 3 or so years since I have been on the road and I need to relearn quite a bit.\n\nI was planning to pay for a lesson this summer in my hometown, but I can't get into the SOS until August to retake my written test and I need my permit first.\n\nI tried looking on Google but I can't find anything.",

I took it in high school (which was when I passed the written test that I guess expires?). I have to retake my written test but can't get into the SOS for quite a few months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my hometown, there are some places that if you pay 100 bucks an hour they will reteach  18+ people road skills. I was hoping there was something like that in Mt. Pleasent but can't find anything",

I would also look at SOS offices in the smaller towns surrounding Mount Pleasant as they may have some appointments available since they have smaller populations. I got lucky and got a next day appointment in May!",

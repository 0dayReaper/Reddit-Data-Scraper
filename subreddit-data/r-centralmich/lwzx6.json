    "postText": "So I've noticed a lot of you have an issue about finding things to do in MP! Lets put our brains together and get some of our favorite activities on one thread. Grab a friend, roomate, fellow redditor or fly it solo and do some of this stuff before you rip apart our school for not having enough stuff to do. \n\n*Note: These activities are suggestions, participate at your own risk. Reddit nor any of its posters take responsibility for the actions of you or anyone who uses this list*\n\n**Restaurants:**\n\n[L1](https://www.facebook.com/pages/L1-Bar-Grille-Nightclub/215491685135422) - Just opened up. They have delicious $4 burgers and french toast, and they're open 24 hours.\n\n[Cranker's Coney Island](http://www.crankersconey.com/) - 24 hours, breakfast is served. Late night dinning is advised insomniacs.\n\n[Mountain Town Station](http://www.mountaintown.com/) - Delicious delicious food. This place is a little more expensive but you get that authentic pub feeling and some food you won't forget. \n\n[Midori Sushi and Martini Lounge](https://www.facebook.com/midorimp) - The most expensive restaurant in town/unless you know of something else/ this place is fancy. Call ahead for reservations, it hasn't even been open for a month! Plan on spending 20 bucks per person, maybe 25+ if you want a glass of sake or wine/beer. \n\n[The Brass Cafe](http://www.thebrasscafe.com/) - Family owned, nice downtown location and a pleasant dining experience. \n\n[The Bird](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=Rgi&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1524&amp;bih=815&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=the+bird+bar+and+grill&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=the+bird+bar+and+grill&amp;hnear=0x8822031d4662f9ad:0x79d6ac19cc22d5db,Mount+Pleasant,+MI&amp;cid=0,0,13985659458764738126&amp;ei=LXWwToS5CYe0qQHHivWtBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ct=image&amp;ved=0CAUQ_BI) - It's a tradition for my roomates and I to go get burgers here. It is a bar, but that doesn't mean you have to go there during peek drinking hours. Try stopping in for lunch, the burgers are tasty. \n\n[Max and Emily's](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=max+and+emily%27s+mount+pleasant+mi&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=max+and+emily%27s&amp;hnear=0x8822031d4662f9ad:0x79d6ac19cc22d5db,Mt+Pleasant,+MI&amp;cid=11347908724632595714)\n*\"downtown establishment that serves delicious sandwiches, paninis, soups and coffee. Its a bit pricier than a Subway but its worth it every now and then.\"* (-PolishKatie)\n\n[Stan's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/stans-mount-pleasant)*\"Loved going there for breakfast or lunch when I was on campus. Great homestyle meals for cheap. If it's busy it can take a while, due to it being a smaller place. Be aware, it's cash only. (but there is an ATM across the street!)\"* (-ctkraig)\n\n[The Italian Oven](http://maps.google.com/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=the+italian+oven+mt+pleasant&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=the+italian+oven+mt+pleasant&amp;cid=0,0,8162428034009274725&amp;ei=tYeyTqXKNqu42QXT5PnVAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ct=image&amp;ved=0CAsQ_BI.) *\"I don't eat out a lot so I can't compare the Italian Oven's prices to any other restaurants in town, but it's always seemed affordable enough and the food is well worth the price anyway.\"* (-AgentMichigan)\n\n[Pixie's](https://www.facebook.com/pages/PIXIE-Restaurant/149698020851) \"Great food, great 50s motif. Plus, you can always try and get your name on the wall for eating a certain number of bitty burgers or coney dogs.\" (-AgentMichigan)\n\n[Shins](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/208/1549351/restaurant/Michigan/Shins-Korean-Restaurant-Mt-Pleasant) Best Korean Food (and only Korean food) in Mount Pleasant. Reasonably priced and friggin' delicious. It's personally my favorite restaurant in town, but that statement comes with a little bit of a bias. \n\n\n**Entertainment**\n\n\nBowling at the Sac - Bring 5 bucks, rent some goofy shoes and get a game going with some friends. Don't forget to bring your student ID!\n\nHot tubin' - I've personally only been to the Bluegrass hot tub (open 24 hours) and the Sac hot tub, but there are tons more out there. Saunas and hot tubs are wonderful post exam stress relievers. Seriously folks, I waited way to long to take advantage of these. \n\n[The Ice Arena](http://mpicearena.org/home/2011/08/30/public-skate-schedule/) - I bet you didn't know we had an ice ring. I also bet you didn't know there was open skate for the public. Now you know! While you're here you can also check out Hockey games, and the best of all things winter sporting related (that isn't downhill activity).\n\nThe movies - You don't have to go to [Celebration Cinema](http://maps.google.com/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=celebration+cinema+mount+pleasant&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=celebration+cinema+mount+pleasant&amp;cid=0,0,3849872903809852757&amp;ei=l6OwTt2uLZKHsAKyr5i8AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ct=image&amp;ved=0CAsQ_BI) because there are a ton of other areas around campus where you can watch movies on a large screen for free!  \n\n**MISC**\n\n\n-Intramural Sports \n\n-Disc Golf Course by Deerfield Road\n\n-Tagging (Don't get caught! paint at Walmart is 99 cents a can)\n\n-Looking at really old newspapers on the 4th floor at the library (a lot more fun than you would think)\n\n-Attending various speakers and events. [Here's the event calendar](http://events.cmich.edu/) in case you wanna try something new. \n\n-Sitting in classes. I know this is weird too, but sometimes if I'm taking a Gen-ed credit I like to see what I'm signing up for before dropping $300+ a credit hour. \n\n-Volunteering. Do it! There are plenty of opportunities in MP. Google the Soup Kitchen, Animal Shelter, Retirement Home or Community Service Opportunities for more ideas. \n\n-Grabbing your roomates/friends and going to Meijer at 2-4a.m.\n\n-The Casino! Don't spend it all in once place..\n\n-Walk downtown for a stroll in Island Park. Pop on those headphones and get down with nature.\n\n-Invade the suburbs! There are tons of neighborhoods around you. Explore them! \n\n-Thirft store hunting for... room decorations, new wardrobe and everything and anything else. There are tons of antique stores and second hand stores around MP. Downtown and Mission road are your best friends. \n\n-Farmers Market on Thursday mornings. Who doesn't like delicious produce? Support local organically grown foods. Yummy!\n\n-River rafting. Buy a cheep flotation device and float down the river! It's a little cold now, but remember it for the spring!\n\n-Prank Wars. Get your roommates, neighbors, dorm mates - hell prank the entire school. The internet is your friend here for ideas. Keep it safe, keep it simple and make it fun. \n\n-Shooting sports and hunting. You'd be surprised how many people hunt around here. Ask your friends and roommates if they participate, many people around here have cabins/family members with equipment. There is a shooting range in Midland, but you'll have to make the trip. \n\n-Surprisingly the [Geocaching](http://www.geocaching.com/) community in MP is semi functional. Check wikipedia/google if you don't know what it is. I've had hit and miss experiences with it around town, but if you're in the treasure hunting mood grab a GPS or your smart phone and go to town!\n\n-If you have a bike, ride it. Everywhere!\n\n-Deerfield Park. Lake, trails, and disc golf course already mentioned, but the park is great in the winter too. It's got cross-country ski trails and a great hill for sledding or snowboarding. They also hold Civil War reenactments in the park. (-AgentMichigan)\n\n-Skatepark, located @ island park downtown-ish. (-AgentMichigan)\n\n-Veteran's Memorial Library. Located downtown. They have a number of events you can attend, and, of course, lots of books to check out. (-AgentMichigan)\n\n\n**RSOs**\n\nHigh Adventure Club - Rock climbing, White water rafting, Ice climbing, big trips. *(-PolishKatie and Mass_Impact)*\n\nSpanish Club - *\"The Spanish club puts on a foreign film every week, and most of them are award-winning, excellent films. They're a nice (and free!) way to spend an evening and an easy way to meet new people.\" (-PolishKatie)*\n\nFilm Society - You guessed it, if you wanna get your Film Noir fix or just watch some really weird shit, this is the place for you. \n\nAnime Club - Last time I went there weren't any asians. I bet you can't guess what they do at their meetings. (They watch Anime) \n\nMount Pleasant Gaming Association - They meet at the University Center (UC) and throw down with table top games, card games and all sorts of fun stuff. \n\n**Edit - PolishKatie, AgentMichigan, ctkraig**",

            "comment": "**Moar Restaurants:**\n\n-Los Palamino and Los Aztecas are both authentic Mexican food places- very affordable and very yummy. And way better than La Senorita.\n\n-Max and Emily's is a downtown establishment that serves delicious sandwiches, paninis, soups and coffee. Its a bit pricier than a Subway but its worth it every now and then. \n\n\n**Entertainment:** \n\n-There are a lot of random seasonal events held throughout the year you have to keep your eyes and ears open for. For Halloween, they held the Haunted Deadwood Forest near the casino, had the pumpkin patch, and had a very entertaining Haunted Castle with 22 different rooms.\n\n-The school holds numerous movie viewings almost every week. The Spanish club puts on a foreign film every week, and most of them are award-winning, excellent films. They're a nice (and free!) way to spend an evening and an easy way to meet new people.\n\n**MISC:**\n\n-There are a lot more clubs on campus than I think people realize. One that I personally think is incredible is the High Adventure's Club, which goes on trips to places like West Virginia to white water raft, ice climb, etc. \n\n-My friend is trying to get a group of people together to start a fighting games club. Perhaps if we found more interest in that we could get something cool going there. \n\n-Hall of Heroes is a cool little place on Mission that sells things like comic books and holds a weekly D&amp;D game. \n\n-There's also a disc golf course located at the [Deerfield Nature Park](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=43.595278,+-84.893056+%28Deerfield+Park+%29&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A), about ten minutes away from campus. I definitely wouldn't recommend going there as a beginner though, as the holes are much more difficult and it is easy to lose a disc. The park is also great for a nature walk or picnic, and has a small lake to swim in during the summer. ",

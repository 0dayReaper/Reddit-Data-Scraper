    "postText": "I'm guessing they'd be good if you used up your guest meals, but otherwise? Also, can you use your all-access meal plan and FLEX dollars for things other than what's on the dining hall menu (for example, I see there's a 7-Eleven on campus, could I use them there)? Sorry for all the silly questions.",

So say if I wanted to eat somewhere like the dining hall in the East community then I use my all-access plan, but if I wanted to get some Starbucks or get a Monster from the convenience stores in the dorms then I use my flex dollars?\n\nOn Google it said there's a 7/11 but Google Maps for the campus seems to be all sorts of messed up and goofy. Thanks for the heads up on that!",

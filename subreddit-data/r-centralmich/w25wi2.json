    "postText": "Sorta inspired by my question from a few months ago about the empty buildings across the street from CMU.\n\nBut going into my 4th year at CMU, I feel like I've heard a lot of students express that they feel the CMU off campus community simply isn't as fun/interesting/inviting as the off campus communities in other college towns are. \n\nThis seems to cause a lot of students to stick to staying campus/rarely going off campus and traveling on the weekends to other college towns.\n\nPersonally, I feel like the lack of walkable restaurants near campus kinda sucks. \n\nSo what changes, businesses, or additions to the community would you like to see?",

Better research opportunities and specialized programs might help as well. \n\n\n\nPersonally feel the biggest deterrent to CMU is the city itself. A lot of students want to party, bar hop, etc. Mt pleasant has made that increasingly difficult over the years with their city ordinances. Add on the cost and dropping enrollment rates everywhere and why wouldn't students go to bigger named schools. The research, name, partying, and student bodies all look better to most students. Population wise u of m and michigan state are also closer to the majors cities. \n\nOther schools like mich tech and Lawrence tech are surviving on a specialized engineering curriculum.\n\nEastern has nicer facilities, and seem to give away more scholarships. They have tailored a lot of stuff around a minority student body and attracted a lot of the students who can't get into u of m.",

            "comment": "It has to go back to the way it was in the 90s and 2000s to be attractive to students Again. The City, University, and (Partly) the Tribe all I believe have to deal with the issues at hand:\n\n* The City: Strict ordinances continue to prevent partying, tailgating, and other things that make a college town attractive. While they continue to close down parties at apartment complexes for being \"somewhat\" loud at 12pm on a Friday, places like Wayside stay open despite all the stabbings, roofies, and other terrible things I hear out of that place.\n* The University: Central used to be a cheaper option for college compared to other universities. I remember enrolling there in 2015 as I didn't have a scholarship, and the cost of credits compared to UofM, State, Oakland, etc. was a lot cheaper. One of the reasons why I chose it. Now looking at the cost, it is a similar cost to State. No one is going to CMU if State has a better program and same cost. Hell, they just increased the cost of tuition. [again](https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/CMU-approves-budget-raises-tuition-3-5-percent-17278118.php)**.**\n* The Tribe: The tribe itself isn't really to blame here, but they have been focusing a bunch more on Casino and other resort based things, changing the dynamic of Mt Pleasant from a \"College\" town to gambling/getaway town. This really took place in 2020 when Covid hit, as the Casino was a getaway for people that didn't want to deal with the state lockdowns. They weren't enforced there. This causes funding and resources to go to other things outside the university for the city.\n\nPair all three of the above with tons of student-based apartments that needs to be filled on the cheap, people move to Mt Pleasant for the cost of it. This doesn't bring the best individuals. When my friend graduated in 2021, half the people living in Deerfield didn't even go to the University. They all worked at the casino. Not discrediting all of them, but he stated quite a few of them were questionable.\n\nThe University needs to stop increasing tuition for around 5 years on a freeze, work with the tribe more on unifying the city, and work with the people of Mt Pleasant. Otherwise things are going to be very different for CMU in 10 or so years.",

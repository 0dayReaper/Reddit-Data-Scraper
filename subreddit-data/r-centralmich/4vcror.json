    "postText": "Hey everyone. I am a transfer student coming from Macomb Community College. I am transferring for Information Technology in the fall.\n\nBack in February, I was touring CMU's campus. Along with CMU, I toured Wayne State, Western (Didn't know about that fierce rivalry!), Oakland, GVSU (How is this a division 2 School?), &amp; Baker. \n\nCMU had a special place in my heart as soon as I went on the tour. Everyone seemed so nice. On the tour I saw a Sanders supporter and A Trump supporter talking about pokemon out of all things. That is what really did the done deal for CMU for me. \n\nAs I went through and started filing paperwork for CMU, a large variety of positive things happened. Ill start from the beginning. \n\n*Orientation Day, I met two really good friends. I chat with them on facebook on a regular basis, and I cannot wait to start hanging out with them on campus. \n\n*After the day on Orientation Day, I met someone looking to get rid of their sublease off campus. The nice thing is, is that the apartment is right across the street from campus. Living on campus at the cost of off? All while having my own bathroom and room? I took it in a heartbeat.\n\n*Two weeks later, I went back to CMU for checking my transfer credits. 68 Credits successfully are transferring to my degree. Woot Woot.\n\n*After checking my transfer credits, I got together with a Roommate that is staying there during the summer. Extremely nice dude. Went bar hopping to the Bird and had some at a local Hookah bar.\n\n*After a week, I got a call from the OIT Help desk. Not a Depot Tech either. At first they were looking for a summer position, but after I Emailed them back thanking them for considering me, they told me they had a fall opening. Took that in a heartbeat. Other job offers included the local Staples as well.\n\n*When moving my furniture and stuff up to the room last weekend, I noticed there was a poke stop literally accessible in my room. Happy days.\n\n\nSo yeah, CMU is looking really positive right now. I cannot wait to see what unfolds in the distant future with this awesome school. \n\nFire Up Chips. See you guys in two weeks! ",

    "postText": "Hi! I recently just got accepted to CMU and I'm excited because of the fact CMU is so close to home + tuition is so cheap. But I'm getting a little nervous looking at what people are saying about CMU and looking at the classes that come with being a graphic design major. I'm not sure why the program is demanding that I take so many art history classes. I'm also not excited to hear about the declining attendance rate and so many professors being fired and programs being gutted. I'm almost wondering if I should apply to MSU instead although I have no clue if I'll get accepted.",

            "comment": "I got my degree in Graphic Design at CMU and moved in UX midway through my professional career and later into UX leadership.   Like you, I was not fond of the required coursework in Art History but it was part of the program and we generally just toughed it out.   Frankly, I was disappointed in the amount of University Program required courses that I would ultimately never need in the real world.  I believe the last course I took at CMU was Physical Science 105. \n\nSome of the \"art history teachers\" were actually teachers of other disciplines like illustration and therefore the tests and grading were a bit more lenient.   \n\nI'm not sure if he's still teaching at CMU, but a guy by the name of David Stairs was a teacher for many of my courses and he was incredibly good and very knowledgable but a notoriously tough grader.   If you did not have the desire or inclination to be good, he would wonder why you even bothered coming to class.   I learned more from him than any other teacher at CMU, as he was the best.\n\nUltimately, find the best professor in the department and get to know them.  Ask lots of questions.  Spend a ton of time in the computer/design lab and learn from the upperclassmen.   That's how you get good.   DM if you want to talk more.\n\nETA:  Also, there is no quality drop off in Graphic Design programs between MSU and CMU - so if choosing between the two, go with which school/campus/atmosphere you like more.",

            "comment": "Not a GD major, but a studio art + art history major, and all the BFA degrees require the same amount of art history courses. All of the current art history classes are taught by PhDs. \n\nThey require you to take art history courses because it helps you actually be familiar with the history art and be exposed to the history of what you want to do. Plus, it helps you develop critical thinking skills and expand you visual vocabulary. They don't make you take it for shits and giggles. \n\nAs far as I know, there's no talk of getting rid of the art programs or professors, and being a smaller department means you will actually get to know your professors and not just be a body in a computer lab. Plus, a quick look at MSU's program shows you need art history courses there too.",

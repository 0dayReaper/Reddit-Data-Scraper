For all the people complaining \"OMGZ SECOND HAND SMOKE IS RUINING MY LUNGS\". Shut the fuck up.  You receive more smoke in your lungs one time at the casino or other similar places than you do an entire year simply passing by someone who's smoking. Get over yourselves. ",

Public university and therefore public land. \n\nThat's why it says, over and over, that we are to \"remind people that it's a smoke free campus. Hold each other accountable\" \n\nUnless the state (or federal) says that it is illegal to smoke on public property, nothing can really be done. ",

Very little was talked about the litter and it focused almost entirely on public health.  Maybe it's the libertarian in me but if you want to put something into your body and it's not hurting anybody else, then go for it.\n\nAlso, in the article it stated that driving through campus you have to have your windows up while smoking.  Who in the fuck wants to hot box a car with a cigarette lmao.  \n\nI don't smoke, but I believe in individual rights.  This is bullshit.  But I think everyone else is right, and that this will not be enforced so no worries.",

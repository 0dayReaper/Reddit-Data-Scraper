Would you trade the life you have now for it if you could?\"\n\nJust putting out a random thought provoking question to hopefully make a new friend so I don\u2019t feel so alone next year.\n\nMy answer: probably a house cat lol. I totally would trade my life for that. They get to just chill out and nap whenever without any responsibilities.",

Are you living in the dorms? If you are thats exciting, you will meet so many friends! Venture out and explore, dont be afraid to try new things. I went to CMU for 3 years and graduated Dec 19'. It was such a fun school, I already had a group of friends and a boyfriend but I still was able to join something on my own, and everyone is so so friendly. You could even pick up a job thats another way to make friends. It will be super easy to mingle if you will be in the dorms tho:) thats a great experience",

I had a hard time adjusting to being away at school but I think it was because I didn\u2019t live in a dorm cuz I went for my sophomore year, and I wasn\u2019t able to meet anyone on my own and my friends whom I lived with already established their groups. You will be perfect knowing no one and making a way for yourself and meeting all new people:) it\u2019ll be scary but everyone is going through the exact same thing",

Good study abroad program and other programs to take classes off campus. The volunteer center and all the programs it supports, especially the Alternative Breaks program, which was one of my favorites. Decent parks/trails you can find if you look.\n\nWorst: the \"party school\" reputation makes it hard to find people who aren't into that. My. Pleasant isn't big enough for \"culture\" to want to come here. We don't get major celebrity concerts, and there's no venue for national touring shows/plays/concerts/musicals,etc. there's not much in terms of a local food or music scene either.",

I knew everyone in my major in the business college (Information Systems). Whether it was in class or at the bar; we all seemed to know each other, get a long, and 90% of us ended up great job offers before we graduated. \n* I had some outstanding mentors and teachers from senior project classes to freshman geology. \n* Competing in division I sports keeps the university more visible nationally. There are ups and downs in athletics, but pulling off an upset over a B1G team or beating down the Broncos is always cause for celebration. \n* For a small town, Mount Pleasant has perfect college bars. I live in Ann Arbor now, so I'm spoiled in the land of a thousand trendy bars and restaurants. I still realize that as far as the college bar/drinking scene goes, I am really satisfied with what I got in Mt. Pleasant. \n*  As alumni, I think we are more present, proud, and loyal than any of our in-state counterparts. I can wear CMU gear almost everywhere and get a \"Fire Up Chips!\" I even got one in Toronto a couple weeks ago. Besides UofM and MSU, other in-state schools do not have the same kind of support in the Metro-Detroit area. I rarely see vanity plates for Western, Eastern, or GVSU. This support translates to the professional world as well.\n* Leadership Safari. I really do look back at that as a good experience and a great opportunity to get familiar with campus and make new friends early on. It was a little cheesy at times, but I know it was a good thing for me. \n\nWorst:\n\n* Lack of local culture. There are redeeming qualities, and I'm not saying that there is *no* culture in Mount Pleasant, but it's nothing like what you might get in Detroit, Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, or even Kalamazoo. \n* More stupid people than I'd like to admit. Not as much in the business college, but UP classes had their fair share. I realize that most colleges are going to have stupid people, but it can get annoying. \n* Welcome weekend, when everyone brings their trashy asshole friends from home. You know, the ones who start fights, vandalize, and have generally failed to launch. Not all of welcome weekend is bad, just that aspect. \n\n",

Sure, your point is valid but that has got to be rare IMO. \n\n \n\nI think it's stupid for people to be upset they see college things go down in a college town. It happens at every university, nobody should be shocked that a frat kid threw a trash can off the roof. \n\nCollege is a place you go wild for a few years before you have to get you shit together and work 40 hr weeks. You can call me part of the problem, I wouldn't care, and I would never apologize for my actions in college. \n\nI would also never choose to live in a college town, when I'm not trying to deal with college activities. \n\nEither way, if the people of Mount Pleasant keep trying to block students from being able to live on Main Street and the surrounding area there will be resentment of each other.

So, in result, smaller classes, getting to know your professors, etc. \n* The dining hall food is great; only 1-2 universities come close to the offerings CMU gives for sensitive diets and gluten-free. \n* If you're in tech, there are great opportunities for you to get a student position, which makes it easier to get internships/positions later on. \n* Speaking of tech, CMU's tech is pretty modern, and the Internet is blazing fast. It's one less thing to worry about when you're trying to work on things. \n* Mount Pleasant's cost of living isn't too high, which makes rent affordable, even if you don't have a high-paying job. \n\nCons: \n\n* The guests that we get for entertainment are meh, especially for homecoming. CMU has great student involvement with clubs, volunteering, and Greek Life, but entertainment could be better throughout the year. The OP mentioned why we don't get Broadway tours: it's hard to do that when the theater department hasn't invested in updating it to full specifications. That's why Western got Wicked to tour there and [kicks our butts](http://www.millerauditorium.com/). McGuirk doesn't even come close.\n* Western, sucks, but they have **a lot** more food options than we do. Mount Pleasant has a few chains (some of which wouldn't be here if it weren't for there being a college next to it) but there isn't a huge diversity of food. When your only hamburger choices are huge chain restaurants, things get boring after awhile. If there wasn't a Buffalo Wild Wings up here, I think things would be even more dull. \n* If you don't drink, there's not much to do, and for the most part, people don't want to do anything with you. Weekends are bar and house party scenes (which are pretty good if you partake), but if that's not your thing, you'll have to find a group of friends that don't. \n* Our sports attendance as a Division I school is abysmal at best. Football attendance drops off as soon as the weather peaks below 50, and we've had a long history of the student section dying out after halftime. The kicker that recently left our team is right, attendance aside, when you see people wearing MSU and Michigan gear, it looks pretty strange. The new coach is turning things around, and I hope it gets better. ",

It wasn't hard to strike up conversations with strangers or make friends, since pretty much everyone I talked to was a nice person. That was always pretty cool.\n\nI do like the campus. There's something about walking around at night that just felt kind of special to me. This is more personal, but worth mentioning.\n\nThe food was above average, and the POD market with the Subway in Towers was awesome.\n\nI had some great profs! Specifically Dr. J for cinema history, my armchair chemistry teacher (don't actually remember her name, but she was really great), and Foulds in the ENT program.\n\nWorst:\n\nThe culture in Mount Pleasant is simply abysmal. In my opinion, there really is pretty much nothing to do if you aren't a party animal. You have to get really, really creative if you want to do something interesting that doesn't involve drinking / drugs / whatever. The casino is one of the most depressing places I've ever been. Some people dig it the town, but it wasn't for me at all.\n\nI had some truly awful professors. I took a \"web design\" class my freshman year that I literally learned nothing in because my professor didn't teach and barely even showed up to class (Ahmet Ugur).\n\nOverall, I left because of a bad personal experience and because of my desire to get out of Mount Pleasant. It's a fine school, just a horrible fit for me personally.",

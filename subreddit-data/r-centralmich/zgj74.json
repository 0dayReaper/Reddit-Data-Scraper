Glad central has, over the years, made attempts to rectify the name change through educating about the Chippewa tribe but nevertheless perhaps it's time for another name change. Chippewa is actually a misnomer for \"Ojibwe\" as white ethnographers in the 18/1900's misunderstood the nasal-y accent and complicated vowel structure. Sure, as a whole, I'm sure there's few Indians who will protest being referred to as Chippewa but nevertheless ignorance shouldn't be used as justification for calling a group of people by their wrong name and subsequently using it as your mascot (if you can really call it that).",

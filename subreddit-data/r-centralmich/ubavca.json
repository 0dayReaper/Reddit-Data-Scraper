    "postText": "Hey all. Central has been at the top of my list for college since I got a lot of financial aid. My question is how is the school overall (pros and cons) and how is their biology program? I also heard that they\u2019ve closed down some residence halls and their enrollment numbers have gone down a lot\u2026 is central dying out?\n\nDeciding on college is a lot, trying to make the best decision",

            "comment": "The biology department is super solid. Probably one of the strongest programs at the school. Honestly, if you have good scholarships, I'd really consider it. I also have a few friends in the program and they really seem to like it. \n\nNow the question \"is CMU dying\".... is complicated. The majority of small/medium state schools are on track to likely \"die\". In today's world, there are not enough students graduating high school and then going right into higher education. A lot of schools that expanded in the 40/the 50s are struggling due to the sharp loss of money. CMU is one of them\n\nOverall, CMU (like other schools in the state) also simply can't compete with Michigan State and Michigan. With the price of higher ed skyrocketing, going to school in a rural town that has faced a lot of the cosmetic/economic problems most rust belt towns have faced along with tuition that goes up every year isn't as attractive as living in Ann Arbor or Lansing and paying a more. \n\nWhen you are on campus, it is very clear the campus was made for something around 30k or something students and that it only holds about 12k right now. In the Towers, a good chunk of rooms are empty and they are closing North next fall",

Outside of the typical bars if you're 21+ and trips to wayside, there isn't much left outside the student activities. Enrollment on campus is half of what it was 10 years ago. \n\nStill, the education I believe holds up well. The name CMU goes very far with the huge alumni network (250k worldwide right now). \n\nIf you got a good package for financial aid and aren't going to be much in debt, I'd say go.",

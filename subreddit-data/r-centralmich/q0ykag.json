Getting involved with stuff like CFC did really good for him and he had a solid job lined up after graduation. \n\nCan't say much about the IS program. I am minoring in it but am not too involved. The profs I've had are great although the classes are a bit hard.\n\nOne thing central does great is find you jobs after graduation, if you are involved and taking the networking opportunities given to you, I feel like it'd be hard to graduate without a job lined up.\n\nAs for apartments or suites it's personal preference. I feel that places like northwest apartments are the best of all worlds (cheapish, very close to campus, and more spacious than dorms)",

I graduated in 2020 but the most I ever paid for rent in a month was around $350 with one roommate. I\u2019d urge you to checkout Deerfield village for apartments. I found them as the best budget complex",

There\u2019s a bus that goes to each apartment complex to bus students to campus. I never used it so I can\u2019t comment on it. \n\nThere are a lot of other options within walking distance closer in price to your 2224 per semester. I think Polo Village is around $450 and I thought they were nice. The company that owns them has been having problems filling units so you might be able to score a nice deal. The apartment company is called Live With United. I never had an issue with them but I know some people have.",

So 2224 each per semester, which works out to $500 a month. BUT that price is not as bad as it sounds, utilities are included as well as furnishings, plus parking is included (mine was at least) so you don't have to pay for a parking pass. When all is said and done, the cheapest off campus apartment will work out to $400 minimum and will be crappy and far from campus.\n\nTake my opinion with a grain of salt though. I lived in an on-campus apartment (northwest)for a year and really loved it, so I am defiantly biased.",

            "comment": "I graduated from the IS program 5 years ago. It was a wonderful program. The college uses SAP as a teaching tool, which is one of, if not the biggest ERP system in the world. I don\u2019t use SAP in my career now, but the lessons I learned about SAP are transferable to other ERP systems. The professors are great (plenty of good ones, but standouts for me were Dr. Miller, the McBrides, and Steve Tracy). \n\nAt that point in time, the IS program had a 100% placement rate at jobs for recent grads. I am not sure what the stats are now, but I am sure it is still around 100%. \n\nThe university also holds an annual ERP Sim competition which puts students (any student can join, but it is mainly business, IT, and engineering students) in a real world business scenario. It\u2019s a really neat event in which loads of companies come to the event and sponsor the event. Lots of job offers are made at the event and is a highlight for the IS program that puts it on.",

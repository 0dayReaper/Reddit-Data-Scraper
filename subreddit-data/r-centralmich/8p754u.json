Basically, people in various states and walks of life began to get desperate (for GC to stop hurting people) or brave (finally sharing the truth about GC) individually.  And that caused others to speak out.  Why didn't others speak before?  Well, this particular church heavily emphasizes honoring leaders (which, in general is a good thing, and biblical), so over the years when people have left, most have been silent\\-\\-even to good friends\\-\\-about the weird things (psychologically/emotionally/spiritually abusive things) that have happened with their leaders BECAUSE they didn't want to sin by dishonoring leaders or gossiping.  They actually wouldn't have been gossiping (because what they would have shared would have been true).  At Grace Church, \"gossip\" is implied to be a lot of things it isn't.  They also might not have shared because they doubted their own perception of what had happened (because no one else had ever said anything about such things).  I hope that helps.",

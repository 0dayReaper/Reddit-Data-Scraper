If you want to see inside them, here\u2019s a CM Life video from 2011:\n[CM Life Tunnel Video](https://youtu.be/ERZQau_zHAs) \n\nSecond, they\u2019re not safe and it\u2019s an instant expulsion if you\u2019re caught in them.\n\nMost of what goes around about how they\u2019re used for when celebs come to campus and how someone died in them are completely false. They\u2019re just service tunnels and almost every university with an electrical powerhouse has them, so.",

    "postText": "Hi, i'm currently trying to decide on a school to attend this fall. Right now my top choices are CMU and MSU. I was hoping a current student could give me their honest opinion on CMU\n\nI plan to major in English Literature with a specialization towards Creative Writing. I've heard CMU has a good Journalism program, but what about English in general? Are the classes good? \n\nHow is student life? I'm not big on the party scene so CMU not being big on that is not an issue. However, I still like going out with friends and exploring the town, and I've heard Mt Pleasant doesn't have a lot to offer for recreational. What do students do for fun? I've also seen some clubs and organizations that interest me, but in general how is the student life at CMU? What is there to really do?\n\nTravel is something I am very interested in, so how is the studying abroad at CMU?\n\nSurpisingly MSU is the cheaper school for me by about $4000, but i've also been applying to a lot of scholarships and my work study amount is a lot cheaper on my CMU aid package (only $1500) and I feel like I could definitely earn a lot more working on campus. However, since cost isn't a huge favor since both schools are around the same amount, is it worth going to the more \"prestigious\" school? \n\nI hope someone can provide me with a realistic view on how they're enjoying CMU, and what it can really offer me verses MSU. Thank you",

Will probably look more notable on a resum\u00e9 and will have more resources at hand to help you grow.  CMU isn\u2019t in the greatest position in recent years.",

You have a chance to swim in a bigger pond. \n\nIf partying isn\u2019t your thing, I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d choose CMU over MSU as \u201cparty school\u201d is really all CMU has going for it in a lot of ways.",

I understand drinking isn\u2019t for everyone and that\u2019s fine, but the crackdown by police and the university has killed off so much of CMU\u2019s community. I started in 2014 and graduated in 2020 (student teaching, double major), and the change was remarkable. \n\nIt\u2019s a pity, because most new students would chose MSU over CMU in a heartbeat if they were just focused on academics. I felt for the most part CMU had a tight-knit community feel to it, but the administration/Mt Pleasant has done a great job of killing that off. Beyond placement in a few more well-known programs, I don\u2019t know why anyone would choose to attend CMU in 2023. \n\n^ sad to say that, really love CMU but I don\u2019t know how it\u2019ll ever bounce back",

I couldn\u2019t find a social scene at MSU like I could at CMU. Your results may vary. \n\nWith a major like English a lot of your job prospects depend on how good you are. Which school will better help you improve? MSU with its prestige but larger classes or CMU with less prestige but smaller classes and more professor contact? \n\nOne thing to consider is CMU has an accelerated master\u2019s in Creative Writing that only takes one year beyond your bachelor\u2019s. But its not an MFA- and an MFA would let you teach at the university level.",

            "comment": "Graduated CMU in 21, grew up in East Lansing and know a bunch of people who went to MSU, including my brother. You really can\u2019t go wrong with either but let me wax poetic about CMU for a minute.\n\nAs a student of both, the English/journalism departments at CMU are awesome. The faculty are very good at their jobs and their small sizes (relative to MSU) makes them feel like a community. You\u2019ll likely take classes with a lot of the same students and professors and get to know a lot of them. \n\nSame thing with the creative writing program, but even more so. I\u2019m still in contact with a lot of the professors and students I was in class with. The program is designed to emphasize creativity. After you get through the prerequisites and into the 300/400/500 level classes, you really can write and do whatever you want. You also get a lot of opportunities to publish your work in their student-run literary magazine, Central Review, which does frequent readings. You can also join their staff as an elective. I don\u2019t know anything about MSU\u2019s program. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s great, but it\u2019s definitely going to be much larger and less tightly knit. \n\nMount Pleasant is much smaller, less developed, and has a lot less to do than East Lansing. However, after a while I came to enjoy that. When you get a solid group of friends, you become regulars at certain places where you know everybody around. You really feel like you\u2019re in it together. \n\nCheck out frat/sorority rush week. I know for a fact the ones at CMU are way less douchey than those at MSU. Okay I\u2019ve gone on long enough. Just went full recruitment mode. Best of luck on your decision. Fire up!",

            "comment": "Currently a junior here at CMU, my first thought when applying was to go to MSU because I thought it was overall a better school and I wanted employers to see that. After spending there years here, the only positives would be that you get more opportunities here than you would at a bigger school. My friend got into a research lab freshman year, whereas if he went to another school it wouldn\u2019t have been that easy. On the contrary, my old roommate had left because there weren\u2019t enough opportunities. \n\nI\u2019m out of the realm with English, I am on the pre-med track as well as most of the people i know. \n\nWe used to be a party school, it has really gone downhill and there\u2019s not much going on anymore. \n\nOverall, you\u2019re better bet is at MSU unless you prefer a small school. Because we have lost so many students through enrollment, and you wonder why.",

Her mentor and the rest of the English department were amazingly supportive. She ended up publishing over 30 poems while at CMU, worked in the writing center, was editor for a publication, was an honors student and did marching band. Graduated magna cum laude and is headed to OSU for a fully funded MFA and was awarded a fellowship. I really don't think she would have been so successful at MSU or UofM, both which were possibilities. My youngest is also at CMU and succeeding. They both say it feels like a community effort. Good luck to you, wherever you choose!",

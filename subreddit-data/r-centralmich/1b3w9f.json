I can't tell you how many times I almost got hit, even when I was in the bike lane.\n\nAlso, it would be awesome if people left some space in the bike lane through campus. Back when I lived on campus it was nearly impossible to get across campus when people are always walking in it.",

Although there are bike-lanes, we still have to yield to them. When they subsequently complain about cyclist weaving through pedestrians, well, that's something they bring upon themselves when they walk in the bike lane.",

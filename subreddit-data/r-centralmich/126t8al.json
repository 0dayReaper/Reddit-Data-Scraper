Other better / slightly cheaper places I should consider that take reservations?",

Truly incredible food, although still expensive for what it is compared to anything else in the region.\n\nDowntown Midland is only about 30min down m20 from Mt P. There is a number of good spots.\n\nGratzi in downtown midland is a very tasty Italian restaurant. \n\nOxygen (bar) is a great place for cocktails, you can get food there too though. \n\nOne18 is a nice spot as well.\n\nMaru is a good sushi / bar",

Camille's is quite small and can feel crowded on busy days.\n\nI would look at Woodshop Social. It's a new restaurant with great food and drinks and lots of seating. I would say the building is not as upscale as Camilles, but the food is equally upscale.\n\nThe Brass has gone down hill over the last few years. I would not recommend. Midori is good, but costly for what you get. We think of it more as a martini bar than a dinner spot. We go to Maru in Midland for sushi.\n\nIf you need any other meals while you are in town, I'd recommend Max and Emily's as a casual lunch spot, Ponder for quick coffee/breakfast options, The Cabin or Hunters Ale House for drinks/late night, or Freddie's for casual dinner.",

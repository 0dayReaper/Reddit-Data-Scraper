    "postText": "The last meetup was a lot of fun (except for that one part that happened that we won't talk about here!). I'd like for all of us to meet up again before the semester is over, especially those who missed the last meetup(s). Perhaps you're new to the subreddit and haven't been to any yet? More reason to come!\n\nLet's brainstorm some ideas of things to do. Board games, bingo at the casino, bowling, coffee shop, getting matching tattoos, etc. \n\nI know it's pretty last minute but I think having one some time this weekend would be ideal, as next weekend= Thanksgiving break and the weekends after will be stressful before finals and wrapping the semester up. Thoughts?\n\n(and as always, upvote the self post for visibility!)\n",

I personally will have zero time to goof off (I'll barely be able to fit sleeping and eating into my schedule), but if others are interested, we could have a little reddit hang out then as well. Maybe we could hold a study hang out session somewhere. But I definitely want to do this other meetup beforehand as well when we aren't stressing out. \n\nThank you for your input!",

I\u2019m planning an itinerary for a class for visiting professors and I have to try to fit in the 3:30PM game and a concert later that night at 8PM. \n\nWould my guests be able to make it across town and get out of the stadium after the game to make it to the concert? I don\u2019t live in Mt Pleasant but that\u2019s where my college is based and I\u2019m not very familiar with the city.",

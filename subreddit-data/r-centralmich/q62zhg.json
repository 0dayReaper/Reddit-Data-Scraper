I did it as an incoming freshman and even though I didn\u2019t win, I got $2,000 annually of extra scholarship money on top of my base merit scholarships. Just for participating!",

They have above a 3.7 and are very skilled at writing essays. \nDo you know how many people are typically awarded the full scholarship? And If you dont  mind, what was your GPA?",

It depends on the year how many Gold (full ride) vs Full-tuition they give away. I am pretty sure it's only for incoming freshman out of high school though. Definitely have your partner apply!",

So you will probably get a little bit of money for participating most likely if you meet the requirements, (used to be a 27 ACT I believe but they waived that) and then you can get full tuition or a full ride and the extra stuff. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how hard it is, but I would think you would have to be a somewhat involved person. I guess I\u2019ll have to come back here and update lol but I have a 1460 SAT, am a legacy, and have a bunch of leadership like being class president, fbla state president, etc\u2026.I have like 32 total activities, awards, and experiences listed (and some of the awards are really multiple like 4x fbla state champ\u2026I just combined them when I listed them) so I\u2019m not sure! I\u2019m only going to consider going if they give me a full ride, otherwise I\u2019ll go to some place like Bama or Ole Miss bc they are giving me full tuition.",

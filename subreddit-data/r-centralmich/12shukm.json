    "postText": "Hey fellow Chips - curious on your thoughts regarding this! \n\nI attended 2014-2018. I went on to my grad program and moved states since then, and this past weekend was my first visit back to Mt P since graduating almost five years ago. \n\nI\u2019ve kept up with news and enrollment so I had some idea of what campus might be like, but it (and really the town itself) felt alarmingly empty. There are almost 11,000 fewer students than when I began in 2014, and that trend doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019ll reverse itself, even with the small bump in new student enrollment this year. From anecdotal conversations with friends and family it seems that MSU has very much scaled back its admissions criteria, which has hurt smaller schools in MI like CMU, and the current age demographics in MI don\u2019t offer much hope for a future surplus of incoming freshmen. \n\nI was very active on campus and feel a very special connection to CMU and its history/traditions, so it\u2019s a bummer to see buildings adjacent to campus abandoned or very much not at capacity. \n\nWill CMU continue to close off more buildings and scale down staff to adjust to their new size? Do you think it\u2019s ever possible that CMU could become affiliated with MSU?",

            "comment": "I was a student at CMU from 1999-2007.  My wife is from Mt Pleasant and all of our family is living there.  We're currently building a house just outside of town.  As I've been in and out of Mt Pleasant basically for a couple of decades, I've seen a lot of changes.    \n\n\nCMU has had a bad habit (for years) of moving parking lots further away from campus as well as building more dorms.  Mt Pleasant itself has followed a similar trend of continually building more and more student housing all over town.  So much so that it's very difficult to find an affordable apartment as a non-student.    \n\n\nYou mention a few very important trends as well that have been building up and exploded thanks to COVID.  MSU reduced its criteria to help keep its own enrollment up.  CMU used to be ranked in the middle of Michigan's universities for cost but that has changed.  When I was in grad school, they increased grad school by 33% mid-year.  Many students left without graduating.    \n\n\nPeople have also started to realize that trade school offers equal or better job opportunities without student debt. Anyone who wants to invest in their future will look at trade school as much as university.  \n\n\nAs my wife is a teacher, and I worked at her school last school year, I keep in touch with primary and secondary education as well.  The students I worked with (K-5) mostly didn't care and even some of the fifth graders didn't put in the effort to be able to read above a second-grade level.  I've heard stories that high school is having the same trouble.  Why learn when you can just do one of the many get-rich-quick schemes that you see on TikTok or YouTube?  These kids won't be able to go to university without a LOT of remedial courses first.    \n\n\nPutting just these trends together, I see CMU's enrollment being low for a while.  This will have an adverse effect on Mt Pleasant's economy for a good decade.  Apartments will stand empty, there will be fewer people who work lower-end jobs around town, and the local residents will need to deal with this like every other non-college town in America.",

I feel like the beginning of the 2010s were the peak of the \u201cyou HAVE to go to college\u201d mentality, especially on the heels of the recession. \n\nBut now I feel as if the gap in salary or at least certainly the reputation between trades vs college has narrowed, especially when you account for the debt many students have to take on to even attend college. \n\nI think that will be exacerbated too with the rise of AI and automation. I\u2019ve already seen the impact of automation in my own field (business analytics). I think it\u2019ll be a long time before most of the trades can be replaced.",

I was there during the housing market crisis, and despite the country being in a recession, colleges continued to make record profits. I remember thinking then that something was wrong with that picture and they\u2019re finally paying for it now. \n\nKids used to want to get the full college experience and go to a university for 4 years. Now many are getting their basic courses out of the way at community colleges, and why wouldn\u2019t they? It\u2019s 1/3 or 1/4 the cost. And if you\u2019re going to take on that debt, why wouldn\u2019t you aim for MSU/UofM etc? I think a lot of kids have the mindset of, if I have to take debt on, I\u2019m going to do it only if I get into one of the bigger schools. And you combine that with kids also going to trade schools more, and it\u2019s easy to see why enrollment is so down. \n\nWe\u2019ve had a full generation that was told to go to college because that\u2019s just what you do, but the people telling us this went to colleges at a time when a summer job could pay most of your tuition for the year, and didn\u2019t realize that tuition had increased exponentially. The kids now have gotten advice from a lot of us who were laden with student loans and they\u2019re thinking twice about jumping into the college system. As they should. \n\nIn terms of the competency level of kids today, I do think social media definitely plays a big role in distracting them and making it harder for them to focus. You combine that with losing a few years to Covid and it\u2019s a brutal combo. I doubt the monetary incentive of social media plays that much of a role though. As someone who had a tiktok page go viral, you really don\u2019t make much money if you do monetize it, and it\u2019s A LOT of work to maintain. The same goes for YouTube or anything else similar. If you wanted to make any real kind of income off them, it would become a full time job, so it\u2019s definitely not a get rich quick scheme. And since most kids are terminally online, I think they realize this.",

                            "comment": "I was an unofficial college advisor to my much younger siblings.  I made sure to explain why at least a year of community college would save them around $10k.  While the cost there has also gone up, it's still a good entry to university.  My sister would have done a second year at her CC but ran out of courses that would transfer.  I actually wrote about this in a college guide I created a couple of years ago.  \n\n\nMy wife was a fourth-grade teacher last year.  She had one student who insisted that he didn't need to learn anything because he was going to be a YouTube star.  He saw the highlights of being in the top 1% and none of the work.  That attitude was very prevalent at her school.  Then the kids just get passed along.  I am on YouTube far too often and I see so many videos on how easy it is to use AI to earn $10k a day.  These kids leave high school with a low GPA and no understanding of how to earn anything.  Many parents (I'm speaking from personal experience) aren't helping.  \n\n\nRegarding university, you get from it what you put in.  Like programming, garbage in garbage out.  Those who just go for the experience, AKA party, are far more likely to drop out and have nothing.  You put in the work, expand your mind, get at least a minor in something useful, and you have so many opportunities.",

It\u2019s easy!\u201d Without realizing that the biggest YouTubers and TikTok personalities have full media teams at this point. \n\nAnd I agree in terms of universities. I think the important difference is that now a BA or BS holds the same kind of weight a GED did. You\u2019re expected to have one to get a job, except the cost to get one is exponentially higher. So while you can still get a lot of higher education, the cost is just getting too high. I have friends who are successful physical therapists or lawyers that are still paying off massive student loans ten years post graduation.",

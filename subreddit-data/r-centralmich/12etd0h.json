    "postText": "(Honors Track II being the option for honors given for transfer and current students).\n\nI see that there's no scholarships, although there is financial support if you choose to study abroad and I know it'll be good for future applications. Fun activities. But a LOT of hours need to be put in as well as a lot of extra classes.",

If you\u2019re paying extra for it then I\u2019m not sure of the worth, but 1) HON-specific classes are jokes and might help boost your GPA, and 2) It could tip a small scale in a future interview, or it might have job fairs or similar that you can benefit from, and 3) Don\u2019t you get priority from being in Honors? Priority is NICE. The classes you need, hopefully when you want. \n\nIt\u2019s been a good decade since I was in the program.",

And I didn't really think about the priority registration, but you're right about that + the classes being a huge perk. I'll for sure at least consider Honors this upcoming year. Thank you very much!",

In your opinion (if you don't mind me asking), do you think in the eyes of future employers/admissions officers, a student with a good GPA would be considered equally when compared to a person with a good GPA and honors?\n\nA majority of my yearly tuition is paid for (like, $21,750). My biggest concern is how these classes will affect my future career/internships/graduate school.",

Other than that, it's such an untraditional program because honors designated courses are only open to honors students that I'm not sure.",

It will make a big difference in that regard. You don\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to be honors to get that attention but it helps.",

Is there a fence/gate or can I park and walk in?\n\nI'm looking at Google Maps and referring to the track located just south of the Student Activity Building. Sorry, I'm not familiar with the campus.\n\nThanks for any info!",

Remember, you pay for the track with tuition as well, it\u2019s not just reserved for athletes. If they\u2019re there, just stay out of their way and you\u2019ll be fine. Good luck with your training",

I\u2019m a person who loves my alone time and privacy and it\u2019s honestly been great. Just one roommate, your own bedrooms, and a kitchen. It\u2019s also super conveniently located. The walls are pretty thin and you can definitely hear your neighbors sometimes but that\u2019s a given pretty much wherever you go. Some of the buildings are more updated than others (for example I know 1 and 6 are some of the more updated). I would definitely try to tour one of the apartments before you make your decision. Overall, personally I like northwest WAY more than the dorms.",

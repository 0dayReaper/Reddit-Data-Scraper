    "postText": "So essentially I withdrew from two of my online classes on the last day to withdraw (2nd April). I went to check today and they were still on my blackboard, so I emailed records and they are saying I didn't withdraw. I have my search history to show that I was on the page you withdraw on as proof but that's about it, as I didn't bother to screenshot the pop up as I didn't think this would be a problem. Is anyone else having this problem?",

If you withdrew outside the drop period but during the withdrawal period, the course shell is still going to show in Blackboard.  If you want to know for sure whether you're enrolled in the course, you need to check Course Search &amp; Registration.  If you tried to withdraw in CSR and it didn't work, contact the Registrar's Office right away to see what can be done.  There is a drop appeal process that you may have to go through or they may be able to fix things without going through it or you may be SOL.  You're not going to know for sure until you contact them.  I'm not sure who \"records\" is that you e-mailed, but if it's not the Registrar's Office, they may not be seeing current information.  Check to see what CSR says first, then go from there.",

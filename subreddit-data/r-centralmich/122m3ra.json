    "postText": "Hello Chips! I am heavily interested in the meteorology program at CMU and wanted to know of any current and former students that have experience with the program. Here is my background:\n\n- I\u2019m 29 and I live in Detroit with my wife and 2 kids (a 4-year old and an 8-week old) My wife has a great job that is 100% remote so location doesn\u2019t matter for her career.\n\n- I am a financial services professional that most recently worked for Rocket Mortgage leading an underwriting team for a few years before I was recently laid off.\n\n- I am a graduate of Middle Tennessee State with a bachelor\u2019s in liberal studies and a minor in econ.\n\nMy entire life, weather has been my number 1 passion. My wife is on board to help me follow my passions within the next few years, so moving to Mount Pleasant is on the table for us if we do this. I\u2019ve read some good things on the CMU website about the program, and I just wanted to hear about the quality of the program, quality of research and internship opportunities, and how well the program is preparing or has prepared you for your career, weather (ba dum tss) it has been in TV, in radio, as a researcher, or as a professional meteorologist in industry.\n\nThank you for your time!",

            "comment": "I was an IT major, but every single person I know from the program for Meteorology is doing very well in the field. Most of them end up working for news agencies or other places that have funding for weather-based research. I've never met someone once that didn't like the fact they went into the program or regretted it. \n\nThere are not many options that degree as well, from what I remember. CMU's stacks up nicely to the top programs. \n\nIf you plan on moving to Mt Pleasant, I recommend looking into Midland Michigan, as the town is very good for families, and has great school systems. It is about a 45 minute drive to CMU's campus from there. If you're only going 3 days a week, it is completely manageable. Houses in Midland are some of the cheapest in the nation for what you get (I only left because I wanted warmer weather in the Carolinas). Midland can get a little boring though, so just a forewarning there!",

I\u2019m almost equally interested in the idea into possibly going to grad school afterwards and conduct research in the field. I wouldn\u2019t rule out TV meteorology, but I\u2019d like to get a taste of that in an internship setting to get a better understanding of TV meteorology.",

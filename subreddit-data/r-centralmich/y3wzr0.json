There's another one south of campus I have not been to, but I've been told Deerfield is better\nThere's a casino, which might not be the *best* thing for everyone, but be on the lookout for some concerts\nThere's also Karma Cat Cafe, a place that takes in cats that are looking to be re-homed/adopted, but you are more than welcome to hang with the cats\nThere's an escape room on Mission\nBs Music Shop is a staple if you're into music\nAnd if you're into Drag shows, be on the lookout at the bars downtown. They'll have a show every other week I believe.",

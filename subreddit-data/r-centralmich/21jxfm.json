    "postText": "We have had two suicides in the past month. This saddens me as a student of a wonderful college and as part of such a great community we have at CMU. \n    \nI just wanted to post and let everyone know, whether suicidal or not, that there is help out there. People do care about you and that suicide is not the answer. Suicide affects everyone around you. \n    \nLuckily, we have many options around that are more than willing to help in the Mount Pleasant area\n    \nListening Ear Crisis hotline: 989-772-2918\n    \nMid Michigan Community Mental Health: 989-772-5938\n    \nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255 \n    \nJust remember Chips; things will always work out. If you ever need anyone to talk to, don't be afraid to reach out. \n    \nWe're in one of the most stressful times of our lives. With work, school, graduation around the corner, pressure from debt, and pressure from our parents it's amazing any of us are sane. If you don't have anyone to turn to go ahead and send me a message. I'm on reddit half the day anyways I'm always up to talk. \n    \nStay safe, remember people love you, and fire up chips!",

If you go there, they will help you figure out how to feel better or direct you toward a resource that will. \n\nIt's been a godawful winter, and Mt. P can be the sort of place that really grinds when the sun doesn't come out, but that's almost over! Keep toughing it out and ask for help if you need it. Your friends want to be there for you.",

    "postText": "Has anyone tried to live off campus as a sophomore without living with their parents or qualifying for any other exemption? I had a horrible time in the dorms last semester and I really want to attend in person classes, because online has also been going terribly. I tried to get into Northwest so I could live by myself but it filled up instantly. Has anyone done this without disclosing it to the college, and what are the risks of doing it? I literally just want to go to college without suffering lol",

We care about the pandemic, but the way they\u2019re approaching it isn\u2019t the right way to handle it. I\u2019m confused how people don\u2019t get it. Instead of having side door entrances unlocked (key swipe in) they\u2019re having all dorms enter through one main door, and they\u2019re not even sanitizing said doors. I wouldn\u2019t bitch if they were sanitizing or doing any other kind of pandemic control, stuff that makes sense like social distancing, enforcing masks, etc. but funneling all of the dorms into one entrance is asking for trouble. One sick person could infect hundreds of other students by entering that one door. It makes way more sense to have students enter through their own buildings where their exposure is primarily just to the people they live with, rather than all 3-5 buildings depending on where you are at on campus.",

Now we are facing student conduct, fines and potential suspension for repeated door violations. They\u2019ve added a door alarm that\u2019ll go off any time the side doors are open longer than 30 seconds. This is our last ditch attempt. To be clear, it\u2019s the same door alarms they had from 10 pm- 7 am, but now, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.",

It\u2019s not the same as potentially getting caught smoking or drinking, unless someone reports you, they very rarely ever find out. But with the installed door cams and hall cams, we can\u2019t get around it. People are already getting caught.",

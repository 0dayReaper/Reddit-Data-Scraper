    "postText": "Hello All! I recently started a theatre company in Midland with my fiance\u00e9 Megan Meyer. Most of the members of our company are CMU alums (including myself. FIRE UP!) We're big horror fans, so our first production is Evil Dead: The Musical, outside in the woods!   We had an awesome opening weekend, and we're pumped to have two more weekends to shower you in all this show's gory glory.   \n\nWe're doing this production outside in the woods at Stratford Woods Park, complete with a blood spray zone, a mini haunted walk, and food trucks before the performances.   \n\nWe would love for you to come out and see the show, and help support our new company as we establish ourselves in Midland!  More info at: TheFrictionTheatre.org\n\nAnd you can check out our interview with our local news here: https://www.wnem.com/video/2022/10/12/evil-dead-musical/?fbclid=IwAR02pP0QNmpGkca0IpgY9oW5nJXptsjtsghviPvUCwwT29uS_E0lEOFSy28",

I\u2019m a 27 year old female senior at CMU, majoring in Environmental Studies. Does anyone have suggestions on meeting other older/nontraditional students? It\u2019s tough living off campus so I want to try to get more involved with student organizations this year.",

I mostly made friends from my student employment, but there were also some orgs that I found and met up with after learning about them at [Mainstage](https://www.cmich.edu/ess/sai/StudentActivities/mainstage/Pages/default.aspx). \n\nYou can also [set up an appointment with a peer involvement advisor](https://cmich.campuslabs.com/engage/submitter/form/start/430954) if you can't make it to Mainstage.",

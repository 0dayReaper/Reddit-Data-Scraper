He won with a lot of the last guy's recruits, but Poljan just hasn't been the answer at QB. One of our biggest problems has been offense, and I believe it stems from exactly that. Rush was a good QB, so we were able to succeed. Morris was a good QB, so we were able to succeed. Poljan has trouble with the deep ball, reading defenses, and rushing. ",

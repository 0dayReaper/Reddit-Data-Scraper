Very Nice building and setting.\n\nThe Cabin is a good place to split a pizza and get a basket of breadsticks for yourself. More of a standard bar scene but doesn\u2019t usually fill up with college students on summer weekdays other then on Wednesdays.    \n\nLastly I\u2019ll recommend Dog Central, which is a cheap downtown restaurant that has hotdogs with every topping imaginable. From Fritos to peanut butter(dont knock it until you try it), if it can fit on a dog its probably an option. The fries and onion rings are good too.",

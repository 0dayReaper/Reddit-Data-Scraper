    "postText": " Hello,\n\nI'm Steve Marowski, a higher education reporter with MLive. I am doing a story about how students are reacting to spring break cancellations at Michigan's universities, and I was hoping a student or two would be willing to talk with me about their feelings on the topic.\n\nI would need your name, grade, major and hometown, but I would not connect you to your Reddit account in any way. If you'd be open to talking with me, feel free to shoot me a message. Thanks!",

Campbell Hall is in the Towers.\n\nEdit:\n\nThis article is being updated as info comes in.\n\n9:41 AM - The city of Mt. Pleasant tweeted that the suspect is considered to be armed and dangerous.\n\nEdit 2: This thread will get more attention - https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/81emoc/police_responding_to_shots_fired_report_at/\n\nEdit 3: 2 confirmed dead from multiple sources including CBS and Morning Sun.\n\nEdit 4: No more updates from me as multiple other threads are tackling this. It's been all quiet where I am thankfully. Last update is that the shooter supposedly killed his parents and fled, no additional injuries.",

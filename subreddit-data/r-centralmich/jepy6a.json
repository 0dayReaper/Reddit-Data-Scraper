    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am with a simulation league called NZCFL run through ZenGM. We are looking for a head coach for our Central Michigan team! [https://discord.gg/geq7TV](https://discord.gg/geq7TV) This is the link to our Discord where you can join and interact with the entire league going through the season, we recruit and set lineups in Reddit in [r/NZCFL](https://www.reddit.com/r/NZCFL/). If you are interested please use the Discord link and ask questions there, we have beginner information available and if you aren't interested, you can just watch from the sidelines until you are ready to participate. Hope to see you there!\n\nAeroMan",

Where I live is very important to be, so I just wanna know as much as I can before I commit to a place.\n\nAny and all answers are appreciated, but here are some specific questions:\n\n- What\u2019s the political leaning of the area? How important is politics in general in the area?\n- How safe is the community, especially for a single woman in her 20s?\n- How welcoming is the area when it comes to new people?\n- What is the local sense of the community? Are there a lot of local events?\n\nThank you!\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention that this is for grad school, so I\u2019d be living off campus most likely :)",

            "comment": "&gt;What\u2019s the political leaning of the area? How important is politics in general in the area?\n\nI would say the campus and the areas with the students off campus,  like most colleges, is very liberal. But outside of the main area where the students live, the political environment is much more in line with the rest of rural Michigan. Generally very conservative and well, republican\n\nBut in the 2 years living in the area, this has never been a problem and has never come up.\n\n&gt;How safe is the community, especially for a single woman in her 20s\n\nAs a fellow 20 year old woman, I would say very safe. In the last year, there has been 1 shooting and 1 stabbing (off campus) and both were between two people who got into a fight while at a party.\n\nThere was an incident a few years ago where a female student was almost pulled into a van in a parking lot. But I have walked home multiple times at night and have never felt unsafe. The campus is lit up at night and there are blue buttons all around.\n\n&gt;How welcoming is the area when it comes to new people?\n\nIn my personal experience,  there really isn't much college student and non-college student interaction unless you are working off campus or get involved with an off campus group.\n\nThere is, from what I have gathered, some folks who don't really like college students and see them as nuisances that come to town for half the year and cause havoc lol but everyone I have met off campus has been really nice\n\n&gt;What is the local sense of the community? Are there a lot of local events?\n\nMost events are on campus and there is a huge sense of community. There is always something going on (even with covid CMU did a pretty good job at making sure there was still stuff going on)\n\nOff campus, most major events will happen at the casino\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask!",

But don't be surprised if you see a redneck with a confederate flag driving around town. It happens. A lot. But CMU as a whole is pretty liberal. Politics are important I guess? They were to me, personally. \n\n\\- Now, there has been reports of creeping men hanging around Mount Pleasant in the past. But as a young woman in her 20's I never felt that unsafe in Mount Pleasan. I bought some pepper spray when I moved there and I felt safe if I had that. Never had to use it though.\n\n\\- Mount Pleasant is a very nice community when you get to know it! Most people are welcoming and nice, at least in my experience. (You'll have a few assholes, but that's anywhere.)\n\n\\-Downtown Mount Pleasant has a lot of events, especially in the summer with the Beer festival and Art Reach downtown. Be sure to check out Karma Kat Cafe if you like cats. It can be boring at times, but downtown Mount Pleasant and CMU's campus make it worth it.  \n \n\nI grew up in Alpena, MI which is a small town. Mount Pleasant is ALOT bigger than my hometown, but to others it's too small. Personally, I believe Mount Pleasant is the perfect medium between city and country life. I loved going to college there and I lived off campus there for 3 years and it was a great experience.",

            "comment": "It's hard to quantify some of these questions right now because of the pandemic, but here you go:\n\n&gt;What\u2019s the political leaning of the area? How important is politics in general in the area?\n\nThe county is rural, so it's fairly conservative. Mount Pleasant, however, is a fairly liberal oasis due to the university.\n\n&gt;How safe is the community, especially for a single woman in her 20s?\n\nThere are 5 police jurisdictions in the area: city, state, campus, tribal, and sheriff. The vast majority of the crime we have around here is stuff like larceny, misdemeanor possession, and DUI stuff. I'm not a single woman, so I can't attest to how that is, but generally I think the area is pretty safe. \n\n&gt;How welcoming is the area when it comes to new people?\n\nThe town's population swells when students flock in for the year and it shrinks when they all go back home for the summer. It's part of the environment, so people are used to it.\n\n&gt;What is the local sense of the community? Are there a lot of local events?\n\nIn the before times, there were actually a decent number of events. The casino in town has big name artists in concert from time to time (I've seen Fall Out Boy and Avenged Sevenfold play here, for example). Downtown has a summer series of concerts right in the middle of everything for the townies that typically results in at least one of Jeff Daniels or The Verve Pipe/Brian Vander Ark playing yearly. Campus generally has concerts and other non-sporting events going on fairly regularly, too. Who knows what it'll be like going forward, with the pandemic and budget problems, but there's generally always something going on around the area if you know where to look.",

            "comment": "On campus it's left leaning, mid-michigan is pretty conservative. I liked the dichotomy, but there was also a parade of trucks with Trump flags the day Biden got confirmed, so there's that.\n\nIt's a small town really, but the campus and casino do attract crime. There's on average one shooting or stabbing at a party per year, and then there was a few pretty bad crimes after things started opening up again. I've never really felt not safe, but I'm a 6'0'' dude, I'd look up the crime stats if you want hard numbers. \n\nCampus is pretty good for new people, I'd try to find an organization that has something you're interested in early, High Adventure Club is good if you like nature. Just try stuff and you'll find your niche of people.\n\nLocal sense of community is pretty good from what I can tell",

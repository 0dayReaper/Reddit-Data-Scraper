If you commute, Oakland, Eastern and GVSU take those reigns. \n\nCMU used to have the best of all worlds. decent education, affordability, and social life. Now it's more \"affordability and education\" with not too much social life. As they've really cracked down on partying, to a point where it's ridiculous.\n\nThis has brought the enrollment down over 40% the past 10 years. The Board has compensated the first couple of years by increasing tuition, usually 20-30 bucks or so a credit. That brought less freshman in as a result, and it sucked more for CMU long term. Financially speaking.\n\nBar scene is still great and if you can get into a good program, you won't have an issue as a transfer in my opinion. By the time things get old and stale (2 years guessing as a community college transfer) you will be close to graduating. \n\nMt pleasant is a very cheap town too, probably the lowest cost of living in michigan for what is around in the area (bars, stores, restaurants, etc.) No issues finding 1 bedrooms for 800 a month. Roommates might see 450 for each of you.",

Keep in mind I graduated 2018 and kept in touch with some sophomores until 2021 when they left CMU. \n\nWestern when I toured was a bit more exclusive I felt. They didn't really welcome me as much. A lot more people commute there as well. Their football program has been a lot better over the years than CMU. It was in a suburb. The campus isn't as nice. \n\nMt pleasant is excluded from everything. There's no businesses, there's just the casino and university, that's about it. As a result you have a very specific crowd of people in this small, suburbia-style town in the middle of the country. It's 2 miles by 2 miles, literally lol. \n\nI loved Mt Pleasant because it was so chill. It had everything you needed and a low cost of living. I still believe that holds true today, but it's not like it was between the golden era as people call it (2006-2014). 2015-2018 was good too, but a big hit started to be noticed in 2019. \n\nAll matters what you want. I don't think Western has a huge party scene compared to CMU either. It might be a little bigger, but not by much. Your best bet for that vibe is state coming from me.",

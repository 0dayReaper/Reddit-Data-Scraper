This also includes the other information needed. Central is dying for students right now so they probably just admitted you based on your score haha",

How relaxing it is, etc. The university I believe is a one of a kind and just so awesome in general.  I have a very special place in my heart for it.\n\nHowever, how things have been going with the University lately, I cannot recommend someone to go to CMU unless they got a scholarship or had family nearby and it was the cheapest option. Theres just so many better options in the state for the same cost that doesn't have the bad press Central has been getting.",

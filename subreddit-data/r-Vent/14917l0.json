    "postText": "This year started good, that was till Easter came around.  On Easter Sunday I unexpectedly lost my grandfather whom I was extremely close to. After about a month of an extreme depression I started feeling not like garbage.  Then about maybe a week and a half ago I got a new kitten who I named Edgar (as in Allen Poe). As soon as I'm starting to connect to him I wake up to being told that he needs taken to the emergency vets office. After the most stressful painful and saddening two hours of my life all I can do is say goodbye to him, tell him how good he is and was before he passes.\n\nI miss my little Eddie.",

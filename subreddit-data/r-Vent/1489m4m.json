    "postText": "I have been going back and forth with myself on leaving my family. My parents are 80 and 71 years old. My mother (71) recently had a colonoscopy done and honestly no one expected her to live. We knew she had diverticulitis before the colonoscopy, but the rupture of her colon was a surprise. She went from being able to walk and do things for herself to now being confined to a wheel chair (though she is slowly getting stronger with PT). She spent 3 months in 2 hospitals (was discharged and had to go back) in total due to various complications. During that time, I took a leave of absence from a solid job and then decided to resign after 28 days had gone by (company policy gave me 30 days total). I stayed at home taking care of my father (80). I cooked meals and drove him places and we visited my mother almost everyday. My father can do for himself pretty well but he definitely needs someone to look after him on a daily basis. He CAN drive but definitely should not. This time was emotionally and mentally exhausting for me. I have not been taught the ins and out of paying a mortgage, life insurance, paying someone else\u2019s tuition, how to pay the city for utilities, etc. over night I had to make sure I was on top of the household income and pay all the bills plus my own. I will say that I now have a deep respect for parents who juggle appointments, work, bills and kids. \n\nSince my mother came home from rehab, I had arranged for private in home care to look after her for 2 weeks. During the second week I had hit my limit and went on a vacation and used my birthday as an excuse. Also before I left, I had rationed out her meds and posted notes, times to take them and instructions on how to care for her wounds should anything happen. When I came home my mother stopped the in home care services because they were crazy expensive. I also found she had rearranged the pills I had rationed out and so she was unsure of what she had missed or if she had taken things twice. She has become very forgetful and has always been stubborn and independent . Now she insists she needs no help and can do for herself as long as she doesn\u2019t have to climb up stairs. \n\nThis time has been stressful for me. Before this, I was saving up to move out. That savings is now gone. I am the oldest daughter (28) and my younger brother is in school (home for now and helpful but is ready to go back in august). I also have another younger brother who moved out months before the surgery and I\u2019ve maybe seen him briefly 3 times over the last 6 months. He texts our mother but doesn\u2019t see her and is married to work. Anyway although I\u2019ve been conditioned my whole life to be helpful and of service I do NOT want to be a caretaker. My relationship to my parents is not great to begin with so I feel the only thing keeping me here is my need for their money while I try to find a job (my job has since found a replacement and I am ok with that). I also need a place to live so here I am. I already know I want to leave and have even told them I plan to do so. They have both expressed not wanting that and that it\u2019s selfish and they are comfortable knowing that I do not have a job. I currently work randomly as a freelance Brand Ambassador. My goal is to move to NC to go to school to get a specialized culinary certificate and then start my own business. It\u2019s worth noting that while nutrition and food definitely interest me , I am not married to staying in the field. I am married to having the certification,  though, I can really get that whenever. My real goal and desire right now is to live independently and happily from my parents and family. Before all this happened the environment has been toxic and draining. So now I am really ready to leave. \nMy real struggle is with what feels like taking a risk and betting on myself by finding a job and moving out. I\u2019ve moved out before and lost my job bc of covid and had to move back home so there\u2019s self doubt and anxiety from not knowing how things are gonna go (I know no one knows that for sure) I\u2019m okay with my family and people that I know perceiving me as the bad guy. It\u2019s my mental and emotional health over being seen as a \u201cgood\u201d daughter/person. I do feel for my parents though as they are just imperfect people getting older and in need of help. I just can\u2019t be the one to give it to them in the capacity they are wanting it from me. I also just gotta get tf out of my family\u2019s house so I can live my life.",

Put them in a good home if you can afford it or hire a person that takes care for the elderly. There are literally tens of thousands of people in the US that come from abroad with the purpose of getting a job taking care of the elderly, they are affordable and both you and your parents would be happy.",

That's assuming that her parents have no savings whatsoever. They also seem to have a house. You can always sell that house and move into a smaller one or an apartment and use that money for elderly care services. There are plenty of immigrants that will gladly take care of an elderly couple for 2k a month and live in the same house/apartment as them. Her parents are frail and they won't live forever, it's not like there will be a million dollar investment. They have a couple more years at best and deserve to not die because they can't take care of themselves anymore. I do agree that she should go on and live her own life, it would be cruel to make her stay with her parents at that age with no life prospects of her own. But there are solutions that don't involve her staying there.",

I have suggested and done research into getting a smaller place and having in home care. My father is ready and wants to move. He complains about the size of the house and wants to go to Florida. My mother would rather die in our house than move. My mother has taken over the finances again. I have no authority over how they spend their money. Unfortunately the only way anything is going to change with their living situation is if it is forced to. You would think not being able to walk up and down the steps of your non accessible home thus confining you to 1 floor would be that thing\u2026plus your husband is practically begging to move but NO. It\u2019s out of my hands. My mother is stubborn enough to call the police on anyone she doesn\u2019t want on our lawn let alone let an appraiser and real estate agent in the house to sell. I also don\u2019t have access to the documents or the authority to sell the house even if I wanted to ignore/go over her. I\u2019ve spoken with her several times about being realistic and considerate of the rest of the family. Unfortunately, I feel like it\u2019s going to take me leaving and something more unfortunate happening to get her to come to reason\u2026but again she is willing to die in our family home and isn\u2019t very concerned about my fathers wishes. If my brothers and I had the means to get them a smaller place we would but we certainly do not. Plus honestly I doubt my working brother would chip in..he\u2019s got his own bad relationship with our parents and has only been seen briefly 3 times in 6 months. Thank you for this suggestion. It affirms what I figured would be the best course of action. It is certainly doable, but as long as my mother is in charge..not likely until death or something unfortunate. She has said though that when my brother goes back to college and when I do leave that she might consider just spending the money on in home care a few days a week (even though she needs it everyday). It just all feels like a sinking ship and I am jumping off.",

    "postText": "maybe this is stupid and im overthinking it, but whatever.\r  \n\r  \nbasically, ive lived with my mom and stepdad most of my life and my dad lives with his own family in another part of the country, so we dont often get to catch up. earlier today i texted him and told him that i got a position in graphic design at an agency. he said he was really happy for me, but mentioned that this kind of work is something that he had wanted to do all his life, he just didnt manage to get a job in that field. now he works at some IT company, im not even sure what kind of work he does there, but from what ive heard it seems really mundane and unfulfilling. i never knew he originally wanted to do graphic design or even a more creative job as well, though i do know hes a very creative person and talented artist, it never really crossed my mind.\r  \n\r  \nhe seemed dejected after i told him about it, like i was a reminder that he didnt get to do what he loved in life, yet i do. i told him its never too late to try something new, and he just replied that, yeah, thats a good view to hold in life, and nothing else.\r  \n\r  \nand im not trying to make it seem like he had any guilt-trippy intent with responding like this, because he didnt, i think it was the most genuine reaction. truthfully, if i was in his shoes, i would probably also feel a bit, i dont know, disheartened after hearing about this. despite the lack of contact, my dad and i have a really good relationship - i know he always wants whats best for me, and i want him to be happy as well. which is only making me feel more guilty for basically rubbing the fact that i was lucky enough to land the position hes has always wanted in his face every time i talk about it now.\r  \n\r  \nhe still congratulated me and everything, but changed the topic relatively quickly afterwards, and now im afraid i cant really tell him about my job without making him feel bad. and, you know, i might just be projecting and maybe its not all that serious to him at all. and i know that despite everything, hes still going to be happy for me and support me if i find success in this field. i just wish i had some way of encouraging him to maybe still go for his dream job, since as i said, i believe its never too late to start doing something different. and i really with all my heart wish that he could have had a fulfilling career in the field that he was going for all along.\r  \n\r  \ni just dont know how to approach this situation going forward. obviously im not going to opt for a different career now just because of him, he wouldnt want that and - neither would i lol. but i feel the need to do *something* to make sure that he wont have to feel like his son is working his dream job and living a more fulfilled life than him while he missed his chance, or anything like that. i dont know.",

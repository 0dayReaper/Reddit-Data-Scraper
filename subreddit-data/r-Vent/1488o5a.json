    "postText": "Why can\u2019t i just stick to starving myself why do i always cave and eat. I just want to be skinny like my whole family. Everyone around me has a flat stomach and weighs on the low side of for their age and height. I\u2019ve always weighed on the high side. Why can\u2019t i just fucking ignore my hunger cues like my sister does. That\u2019s how she\u2019s so skinny so i should do it to. I have 3 naturally skinny siblings who can eat all the shit they want and lose weight. My brother can\u2019t gain weight my sister is losing weight and my other brother is just average skinny even with all the shit he eats. I eat even sort of \u201cbad\u201d for a day and i gain weight. It\u2019s so fucking unfair. My 5\u20197 male friend weighs 125 pounds (we are young adolescents) and i am 5\u20193 female and weighed 120 before i developed an eating disorder and now i\u2019m at 111. Every other female is less than 100. I fucking hate my life. And I don\u2019t even want to recover. I want to be anorexic. It\u2019s so easy for everyone else to just not eat. Why can\u2019t it be easy for me?",

It damages your relationships and your productivity. You won\u2019t laugh because you are too scared to go out with friends and have to eat. Anorexia is a living hell. \n\nInstead eat whole foods and balanced meals - protein, starch, healthy fat, etc. Avoid processed foods and sugar but do treat yourself every once in awhile. It\u2019s okay to have cake on your birthday. It\u2019s okay to have a bowl of ice cream or some dark chocolate every now and again. \n\nDon\u2019t over exercise as it just makes you eat more. Enjoy a walk, swim, yoga, or playing a sport you like. \n\nI know a few ED nutritionists who would work with you over the phone.\n\nSome ideas of balanced meals according to the glycemic meal plans (often what ED patients are given in treatment):\n\nBlack bean burger on bun with avocado, an apple, and sweet potato. A glass of plant milk/milk with calcium in it.\n\nTwo hard boiled eggs, toast with butter, a small orange, and a yogurt. \n\nChicken with broccoli, a baked potato with a serving of olive oil, and a glass of milk/plant milk with calcium in it. A mandarin orange for dessert.\n\nIf you eat that way, you will not end up binging. Your blood sugar should be stable. You also shouldn\u2019t gain weight if you follow your nutritionists advice.\n\nI\u2019ve maintained the same weight give or take 3 pounds for 20 years eating this way. I would be described as thin or slender by others (but not unhealthy). \n\nI once had a bmi of 14 (and still thought I was fat) and my life is so much better and happier today. Please do not starve yourself. It is such a waste of your precious time on the planet. \ud83d\udc9b",

From the weight and height posted you are not fat, be kind to yourself there are so many more important things than weight. As an adult I can't really say I notice my friends weights just their behaviour. I chose them as my people based on their personality not their looks, good job too otherwise I would feel inadequate if I was to compare myself honestly with some of them.",

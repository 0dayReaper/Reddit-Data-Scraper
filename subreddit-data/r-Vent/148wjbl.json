    "postText": "Ok so\n\nMy step family recently moved in to my house\n\nThere are two twins, both 2-3 years old, and there is Evan (fake name) who is 8 years old. Finally there is Bobby (fake name) who is 10. Theres Jarrid (fake name) AKA my stepdad. They\u2019re all boys, if thats useful in the long run I dont know.\n\nAnyways, Bobby kinda scares me when he gets angry and yells.\n\nFor context: I have various mental health issues (Borderline Personality Disorder and depression) as well as an increased sense of anxiety but not too much for an anxiety disorder. About 2 years ago my dad passed away. I also get into essentially what I call \u201cCry of Fly\u201d mode where I either cry and scream or escape the situation whenever people yell at me really angrily.\n\nSo basically what the title says. Bobby is really hot headed when he gets angry, and he\u2019s 8 years old. Hes also somewhat spoiled (asking for someone to entertain him because he was bored. When I was 8 I found out to do something for myself but again I\u2019m not normal i.e. my mental health shit so idk if normal people\u2014). \n\nI, someone who treasures my dad, have to witness Bobby yell and scream and accuse his dad hits him. I live with his dad (so my stepdad) now and he is far from abusive: hes so nice! He hits his dad sometimes too, yells and screams and falsely accuses Jerrid of abusing him. He e n throws a fit over as something small as pop/soda/whatever you wanna call it.\n\nI understand having one of those phases as a younger child, but in my opinion accusing abuse is way over the line.\n\nAlso: Jerrid is divorced, so he has an ex wife, and my mom now. \n\nWhat do we do to help him? Can we even help him?\n\nRegardless, I came here to express my slight fear. Is it wrong of me to feel this way?\n\nEdit: I also have trauma centered around anger. It wasnt abuse by any means, and if it was I have forgiven her. She was on wrong medication, and it made her irritated and angry. She would get so angry to the point I thought shed start b**ting me (ok I was a child, like maybe 5 or 8)",

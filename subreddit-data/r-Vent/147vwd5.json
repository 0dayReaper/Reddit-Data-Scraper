    "postText": "\n So I am 18F and there is a woman at my job (29-32?F) who I am very in love with. Since the first day I met her I thought she was very pretty but didn\u2019t pay too much attention to her since we worked in different departments. Then they switched her to my department and that\u2019s when I really started having feelings for her. It\u2019s not until recently that we started getting friendly with each other.\n\n I have always been attracted to women much older than me and have always wanted to pursue a relationship with someone around that age. I honestly love this woman so much and want to tell her how much I like her. I want to give her the life that she deserves and I will do anything in my ability to achieve that. I have so much love for her and wish her the absolute best. There is not a day that goes by that I don\u2019t think of her. \n\n I feel as though I cannot achieve a relationship with someone because of the age gap. It\u2019s not something I can talk to to anyone because I feel like people don\u2019t understand me. They just tell me to move on but that\u2019s so much easier said than done.",

She may already be in a relationship, not be looking, or just not be into people much younger than her, let alone be into women. I\u2019m no therapist, but please seek mor friend groups around your own age.",

She is such a nice person and I just love her. I just really hope that whoever she ends up dating treats her with respect.",

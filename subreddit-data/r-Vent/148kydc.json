    "postText": "I HATE people who always need me to talk to them, everyday or worse, multiple times in the day. \nI understand this could be a me issue, not necessarily the other person\u2019s fault, but it turns me off so much.\nI hate texting or talking often, I can be very engaging and fun but I have my limits\u2026 I cannot always be available EVEN IF IM NOT BUSY. It\u2019s like I always have to give a reason for why I cannot text\u2026 I know it would be rude to just say \u201cI cannot talk right now, let\u2019s talk later\u201d so I always give a reason.\n\nLike this guy, we met some days ago. He\u2019s nice and awesome and what not, but he wants to talk often. Sends me a text often, but he also had exam and he wasn\u2019t as available to text.. however today, I didn\u2019t feel like talking at all,but I still tried to talk a little, and now I see a message \u201ctoday you were very gone\u201d &lt;translating it from my language to english&gt;. \nBut it\u2019s not just him, I\u2019ve met so many people like that. They always send a text and if I\u2019m gone for more than few minutes, they tell me that..\n\nI mean again, I\u2019m not mad at him, it just frustrates me\u2026\nI know it\u2019s not his fault but it\u2019s a major turn off when people want to talk often. \nI understand you need to chat often so the friendship/relationship works and becomes better\u2026",

It\u2019s not even like I have things to talk about, I mean my life is pretty fucking boring so what will I talk about? \nI do know how to entertain the conversation but at one point, it gets boring especially if we texts everyday and multiple times in the day.",

I wish you could\u2019ve seen me throw up my arms in disbelief when I read \u201cI know it would be rude to just say \u201cI cannot talk right now, let\u2019s talk later\u201d\u201d. I believe that\u2019s respectful in my eyes. Considering I\u2019ve had people leave me on read and not respond, or respond days, weeks or months later and apologize to do it again.\n\n2. Nothing wrong with telling someone you don\u2019t wanna talk at the moment. I wish people I care about would just let me know instead of not acknowledging me at all cause that hurts. \n\n3. Someone sending you a message minutes later cause you didn\u2019t text back is wild. I could understand if they do that cause you don\u2019t message back by the end of the day, or the next day. \n\nI thought I was a clingy texter",

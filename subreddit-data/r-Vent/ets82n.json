    "postText": "So, I'm going to give you the quick version. Check my post history for the whole story. \n\nSo, a few days ago I discovered a video on my husband's tablet of my underage niece(14/15), naked, in our bathroom. As soon as I understood what it was I called the police and relinquished the tablet to them.\n\nSince then I have gotten an emergency custody hearing set up for this coming week. Surprisingly  (to me at least) the judge issued a temporary order of protection barring him from contacting anyone in my household or coming on the property. Our household is me (35f), my cousin (35f), her husband (37m/ military, currently away from home), their two sons (12 and 6) and my child (5/ fathered by my husband). I didn't think they would issue it because there has been no violence or threats of violence, but the judge was adamant and I am slightly relieved.\n\nI have counseling set up for myself and my daughter and am working with a legal advocate to navigate these processes and start the divorce.\n\nI'm holding it together for my daughter but every second I feel like I'm going to pass out or throw up from the emotion of it all. Three days ago, I thought I had a loving partner and husband. I thought that I had broken the cycle of abuse  that has followed my family for generations.  The suddenness of it all has me feeling on the verge of collapse.\n\nI never wanted to be a single parent. I loved my husband and meant my vows, but always told him that the one thing that would make me turn my back on him and walk away was anything having to do with kids/abuse. I have no regrets, or even real feelings about the loss of my marriage, right now. I know I did the right thing. My current focus is on keeping my daughter safe.\n\nBut how do you pick up the pieces from this? How  do I help my daughter and niece get through this and ever be ok?? I feel completely alone, though have found a community of friends, that I didnt realize I had, ready to bend over backwards to help. I've slept, maybe, 4 hours since it happened (2 days ago? Idk they've all run together.) \n\nI've reached out to everyone I can to try and help me figure things out. I have no money and no access to any bank accounts. I haven't worked for the last five years because of postpartum and PTSD. I've spent these years busting my ass in therapy to make sure I was mentally ok enough to parent and be a functional adult. I don't know how I'm going to pay bills of keep food on the table, but I am in contact with a women's shelter that has promised to help and I am going to contact social services and see if we can get emergency assistance.\n\nI'm also pretty sure he sabotaged my cousins car, which is the only transportation we currently have (had). He was at work when everything happened and when he called me to let him know he was on his way home, I confronted him and then told him he needed to bring her car back or we would report it stolen. I called his Dad and had him meet my husband at the house to take him to their house ( my daughter and I were laying low at a friend's house).  He's driven her car since she got it 6 or so months ago and it has always been fine. It got him to work that day and back with no trouble. When I went to go to the courthouse the next more the car broke down half way to court and hasn't been drivable since. \n\nYesterday, I discovered his google email was logged in on my daughter's tablet. I went in and looked at his search history and it confirmed everything: \"how to empty oil from car quickly\" \"No oil car damage\". It got worse from there: \"Can you plead the fifth at a custody hearing\", \"can you lose custody of your child for unrelated child pornography\", \"When does child pornography become a federal offense\" and so on. I have been in contact with the detective and let him know about all of this.  \n\nAnd now, I'm just trying to remember to breath.\n\nEdit: I made a post on r/foodpantry if anyone is able to help. Thank you all for the support. You have all helped me let go of the guilt. I will be forever grateful for this community's support during this trying time.\n\nEdit2 : The post in food pantry was removed. My title/text were shocking when they shouldn't have. Also, I'm unfamiliar with Amazon and was in a rush trying to post and think of what we need so I just selected whatever popped up in whatever quantity with out looking at prices and quantities. I couldn't figure out how to add some basic food stuffs (said I need a prime membership,idk). Any way about it I'm completely  emotionally and mentally drained and don't have the energy to figure out how to fix it. So, I'm not going to repost it at this time. I may do it later or just try and figure out local pantries. Thank you all for the support.",

You have already taken the first big step to recovering,you are being brutally honest with yourself about your husband and not suger coating it so that you can 100% protect the children. If there was no touching and your niece wasn't aware she was being filmed some  counseling would prob be the best approach. I also see that you and your daughter are doing counseling which is good. Please take care of yourself too now everyone is safe because you have done the right thing. Your are a true mother and protector \u2661",

Your comment on having a mantra to get through it got me thinking, and I realized I've been saying two key phrases a lot lately: \"I don't deserve this\" and \"I wanna shoot myself\".\n\nObv the former is empowering. The second seems really scary but tbh it's totally not, because the reason it's a healing mantra is this: whenever I say it, I feel awash in reasons to not do it, and I remember the good I have in my life.\n\nJust read your comment and wanted to say this, talking about my feels helps me heal and I'd never noticed my mantras before you said that so I kinda wanted to thank you by telling you how you've helped me. Every little bit takes me closer to feeling self-confident.",

I had an awful experience where I was with someone one night and later found out he did something to a young girl I knew (we were all a part of a dance community) I messaged his wife to tell her what the girl told me he did and it became this big drama where he denied everything and she ended up pretending it never happened so there wasn't much I could do after that . but I hardly knew him .. I was gonna say that my experience was peanuts in comparison but idk hopefully at least your husband hasn't touched anyone.. but as far as deception and betrayal ..  I cant even imagine girl and my heart goes out to you and if u need to talk I'm here ..",

I found out i was pregnant and was so excited. A week after i found out i was pregnant his best friend from high school called me and asked me to come over. I figured he needed me to watch his kids for a bit so he could run errands. I'd watched them a hundred times. I got there and could immediately tell something was wrong. He and his wife had me sit down and told me what he had done to their 6 year old daughter. I immediately started throwing up. I gave him the benefit of the doubt at first because there wasn't any evidence. Police and CPS got involved (i had a 6 year old son from a previous relationship) and he had to move out immediately. The more information that came out, I slowly started to realize that the accusations were true. By the time i was ready to cut ties completely i was 3 months pregnant. I told him to stay away and haven't spoken to him since. MY son is now 3. I was so scared to be a single mom to two boys. My family has been my support system. It sounds like you have a pretty great support system. This will probably be buried but i want you to know that as terrified and hurt and betrayed and disgusted as you feel, it'll be ok. It will get easier. It's ok to break down but you make sure to pick up the pieces for your baby. Good luck with everything.",

But I'm not a victim here. I will suffer, but I chose this man and had a child with him, so my pain is the price I pay. \n\nWe have a tablet that is mainly my husband's, but occasionally I or the kids use it. It was sitting on my desk this morning and I thought I might play a game on it that I hadn't played in awhile.  \n\nI've always looked at the pictures/videos. Usually the kids take them and you have to guess what they were aiming for or what they are saying in videos. I scrolled through looking for my game (deleted) and decided to look at the gallery instead. There was a video that I had never seen. It was at the first position,like it was the newest. I clicked on it and immediately called non-emergency to send a police car to my house.\n\nAt first I thought it was,idk, peeping-tom or bathroom fetish porn. Then I realized it was my bathroom. THE VIDEO HAD BEEN SHOT IN MY BATHROOM! It looked like the camera must have been hidden around the window, giving a full view of the bathroom.\n\nAnd in the video? In the video is my niece (who hasn't been to my house since 2017). My niece was 14 the last time she spent the summer at my house (they live 1000 miles away) and this was a video of her with her back to the camera. She was changing her swimsuit and bends over in a way that shows her vaginal/butt region. \n\nThis man.... that I thought I knew and loved. The father of my daughter, I thought he was a perfect male role model for my niece  since her father abandoned her.  I promised her and her brother when their dad left that I would always protect them and I brought a man into their lives who SET UP A FUCKING CAMERA in the bathroom to catch his glimpse of her innocence. And he kept that video and moved it to different mediums (we got the tablet long after she was in the house). \n\nThe police took a report and the tablet. I called my husband's father and asked him to be at the house to pick my husband up when he got off of work. I ran and picked up my daughter and went to a friend's house. He called to tell me he was on the way home and I lost it. He kept saying I misunderstood. I didn't listen anymore. You violated everyone in this house. Everyone who has visited and used our bathroom. And now my niece gets to find out what he did. I've broken my promise. I did not protect her like I should have.",

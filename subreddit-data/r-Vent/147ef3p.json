Basically, I honest to God thought my brain was slowly shutting down. Nothing around me made any sense anymore. At one point everything went black and all I could see what this terrifying white face coming for me. I was screaming at the top of my lungs. It was actually the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever experienced. I thought I had died and was sent to Hell. I woke up in the hospital because I had a panic attack. \n\nThe next day? Nobody cared. I tried explaining to my dad and he didn\u2019t care. I was shivering because I was still recovering from the experience. He just gave me a look and said \u201cWhat\u2019s with the shivering?\u201d Clearly he didn\u2019t believe me when I told him how terrified I was. I just told him I was cold. \n\nI tried telling other people online, and they don\u2019t care either. They\u2019re just like \u201chaha that\u2019s crazy man\u201d. I feel like this experience I had isn\u2019t valid or doesn\u2019t matter because no one else thinks it was a big deal.",

Description:

This is simply a subreddit dedicated to venting. Had a bad day? Tell reddit about it. Share your stress with us. This is a community where people can give you advice, and take some of that weight off your shoulders. Here it's perfectly fine to complain!

Posts must be about venting: This subreddit is intended to be a talking space and venting space for people who wish to vent about life, good or bad. As such, posts just asking for advice, asking for karma, general help, question posts, shitposts, posts roasting/slandering someone and other posts not fitting a vent will be removed

Additionally, posts soliciting DMs to talk and posts just offering to talk to people will be removed at the mods discretion.

Posts must be longer then 100 characters, clear, understandable and elaborated in the post body.: All posts must be more than 100 characters in the post body, elaborating is strongly encouraged here and posts must be clear and understandable in English. Mods reserve the right to remove posts that are not clear and elaborated to their judgment

Be kind to other redditors: Being kind to other users here is enforced. Please do not call or post users names, insults or slander even if you disagree with them. If they put up a slander post or an insult to you in a comment, please repost and don't reply

No posts about planing/committing/threatening your suicide, self-harm or other forms of self-injury.: While we understand most of these threats/posts are just a way of venting, we cannot allow them here due to the severity and in these cases we will defer you to our [resources](https://old.reddit.com/r/Vent/wiki/resources), /r/SuicideWatch or /r/SelfHarm instead.

No begging/asking for charity.: We are not a charity or financial aid subreddit and due to our inability to control the exchange of money through Reddit, we are not the appropriate community to ask for money. Please do not include cashapps, venmos or other forms of financial transfer accounts.

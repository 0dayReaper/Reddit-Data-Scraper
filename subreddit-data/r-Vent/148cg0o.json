Yesterday she told me bout her ex and how she had her first kiss and lost her virginity to him. I haven\u2019t gone through any of that yet. I didn\u2019t really care and still kinda don\u2019t cuz I really like her but at the same time to me it felt like she\u2019s still somewhat into him wit the way she was describin him and her tone of voice when talkin bout him and how to me he was better than me. He\u2019s taller than me and more athletic than me and I\u2019m insecure ash but I haven\u2019t told her. Aside from that I made insensitive jokes when she was tellin me which was wrong of me but it was jus the way I tried makin light of it and sayin \u201cthat\u2019s the past\u201d. Ofc she got upset and to me it seemed like she was overdoin it and tellin me to \u201cact my age\u201d over sum jokes and me not carin bout her past that much. After that whole argument she kinda jus rubbed me off the wrong way wit everythin jus cuz it seems like she\u2019s still somewhat into him. I may jus be thinkin that cuz there was someone else before me or somethin but I don\u2019t know for sure. I\u2019m already tryna move on a lil and find somebody else cuz I feel like ion belong anywhere round her. Tell me if I\u2019m goin about it all wrong or what the deal is \ud83d\udc80\n\nAlso the way she was sayin how he was also her first love also rubbed me off the wrong way \ud83d\udc80",

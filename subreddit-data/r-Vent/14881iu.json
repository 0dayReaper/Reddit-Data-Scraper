    "postText": "My last relationship crashed and burned over 2 months ago. It broke my heart at the time but looking back I'm happy it ended. We weren't a good match, he was too self-centered and a complete narcissist. \nBut now I've started talking to a new guy and I thought we really clicked. Our first online call lasted almost 12 hours. We game a lot together and we sext a lot as well. Sexually, he's a perfect match for me... but I'm having doubts as if there'll ever be more than that. \n\nI'm such a pessimist about everything and always doubting my self-worth...\nHe takes so long to respond to my messages and we haven't had a proper conversation in a while... I just miss how it was and I feel like he must be losing interest. I totally understand that he has a busy life and all, but how hard is it to say he'll be too busy to respond today? Instead he responds after 4 hours or longer... meanwhile I'm all excited to respond, knowing I won't hear back for a long time...\nI'm just tired of doubting everything. \n\nI talked to my friend about it (she's gamed with us all together). She suggested he was stringing me along... so I just don't know anymore. Just needed to get this off my chest.",

            "comment": "My advice is to stop responding. Act like he doesn\u2019t exist. Act as if you\u2019re unbothered. Because at this point he knows you are there and will respond when he texts or calls you and he takes advantage of that while he is talking to other people. I studied psychology in college and have gone through similar interactions and it fucking sucks because they act like they are all about you at first but then string you along. And when you\nSay something they always use excuses like oh I was working or I got home from work and fell asleep or I\u2019m not on my phone a lot when I\u2019m with friends blah blah. So you take that power back. Don\u2019t text him. Don\u2019t answer him. Do to him what he did to you and he will either not care cuz he was using you like an asshole\nWould or will fight for you cuz he honestly doesn\u2019t communicate well. Love you and wish you the best babe x",

They will get more impatient with each time cuz they are expecting you to answer them. Whenever you do answer them just be casual, \u201coh hey what\u2019s up, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have my phone on me\u201d. he will text and eventually ask in some way what you\u2019re doing and BE VAGUE. They know you will give them all the details and we both know that will happen too because you don\u2019t want him to think you\u2019re doing anything that will make him stop talking to you. Pull the shit they did to you on them. They will realize they are losing that control. They will start to get pissy and will text you back with short and curt answers and it\u2019s because they don\u2019t have that control over you. They do this because they know you care and they want to do something they know will bother you so you will react and give them reassurance that you do care. They want that attention. Don\u2019t feed into it.",

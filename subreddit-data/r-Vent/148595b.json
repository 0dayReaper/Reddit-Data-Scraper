    "postText": "Whenever you hear married couples going through rough patches, you hear about how one or both sides daydream about being with another person (maybe). \n\nFor me, more so recently...I've been daydreaming about being single. And its back and forth between about living in a studio apartment all by myself, or its about living with my family again and sharing a place together with them. \n\nHow fucking back-ass-wards is that!? \nI don't get it, but it's there. And it's there more often than it ever was. \n\nI love my spouse, don't get me wrong. I definitely don't want to see other people. But I just can't help but daydream about what if I was single.",

Because my husband ended up running out on us after 11 years together for his dream of an apartment with no responsibility but left a child behind with no contact and drug me through hell back and forth before finally deciding on divorce....be up front...",

We've talked about feelings not too long ago, one of those moments where everything piles up and then just comes bursting out at once... but they seem to be on a similar page. We both love each other and don't want to be without one another, especially dont want to be with other people...but at the same time, we both think that the other will be better off if we separated, not causing each other stress or feeling like one another would be happier that way.\n\nWe're both siding on not leaving each other, though. It's not like we're miserable together (for the most part, at least). It's just our lives as a whole could be much better and we both know there needs to be some changes.",

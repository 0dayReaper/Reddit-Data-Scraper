    "postText": "The title is awful but listen:\nI live in Latin America and I\u2019m not especially rich but I have money to spare and not just a little. I thought this was the normal thing since ever since I was little I always got money from my mom to just spend it on whatever I wanted at school or at meetings with my friends, whenever. \nBut as I\u2019ve been growing up I see that it\u2019s not a very normal/common thing in my country. I always thought some of my closest friends had a lot of money but now I see they get little to nothing to spend on things they like/want and their parents struggle with money. And that\u2019s not an issue for me, I don\u2019t stop talking to people because they struggle but their mindset is what I don\u2019t like, they think 99% of stuff to do is only for rich people like eating at certain places, going to the movies, buying clothes, etc. \nPoor people will always say no to a million plans because \u201cthat\u2019s a rich people thing to do\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s just too expensive\u201d. \nThey think having fun is expensive, no matter the place or the activity. \nAnd I hate that every time I want to talk about something I did or bought for myself I always get this jealousy look because they think I spent thousands of dollars that they could use on better things. \nI don\u2019t want to brag about how much money I have, I\u2019ve never really had a job and that\u2019s one of the main reasons why I don\u2019t brag and I don\u2019t really have a lot of friends because they always ask me questions about my travelling experiences or things I have and when I reply they simply ghost me even when I give a totally normal answer to their questions and it\u2019s hard for people to not like me when they first meet me so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong. \n\nEvery comment will be appreciated and if someone is going through the same feel free to send me a message and we can talk ;)",

Work ethic is incredibly important, but (this is in the states) if you dont go to college, your chances of getting a job that would even get you to middle class is incredibly low. There are ~40 million people here living below the poverty line, making under $13k USD. People don\u2019t just get money, and when rich people buy expensive things, you\u2019re not buying from the person who is selling it, you\u2019re buying from other rich people, cutting the poor out of the equation.",

Especially if you do it once a week or more. \"Poor\" people as you call them can't even think about doing these things because they know it will only lead to them not being able to eat for the rest of the month.\n\nThe look they give you when you talk about these activities, even when you talk normally about it, is just because it reminds them of their condition. I think it's quite justified to get jalous when someone talk about it. Especially if you do this a lot.\n\nOf course, it isn't your fault at all, you were just lucky to be born in a good family with money. But please try to understand other's point of view. Or if you don't want to do this, you can always find other rich people and talk about your purchases all day long, i heard they like to do this.",

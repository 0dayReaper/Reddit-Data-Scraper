    "postText": "this is a pretty long story of mine and it is very eventful but unsure if it falls under a vent category so you could skip if you would like. i will not disclose any personal information. i am a teenage girl and i was living with my dad and my step mother and we found out my stepsister had a baby, we planned to move to the town she lived in so we could spend time with her baby. i got excited and i was planning to finish my school year since it just started. one day after school my stepmother told me plans got changed and we were moving in a week, my mind went flying around the thought that i was gonna lose everyone i knew at the school i was attending and i was looking forward to the change just a bit. i had in mind i could keep in touch with my friends on snapchat and instagram. my parents didn't like me having snapchat so i hid it in a way but they were cool with instagram. the week flew by and the next thing i knew it the day before my school started. my stepmother told me to enter with a positive attitude since i sometimes doubt myself on things and she said i should make friends and i said i will. the next day school started and i was really anxious and everybody knew one another. one girl greeted me and suggested to be friends and i agreed and added her on snapchat. she never really talked to me after that day and she vaped so i avoided that. also i think this would be important but i had a boyfriend online, (i know it's a bit cringe) prior to the move and i knew him for about a year. my stepmom bugged me over and over and asked if i had made friends and i told her it wasn't easy for me because i get really anxious around people i don't know. she kept telling me i had to make friends since it was a small town and it's good to know people and my dad agreed with her. all my life i've been a quite person and it's been hard for me to approach people and then overnight she's expecting me to be the most talkative and bright person just so i can make friends. one night while my parents were at work in the city about an hour and a half away i was on a call with my boyfriend because i used to always call him and he would bring me comfort and assuring the change could be good. one night i decided to send him pictures (if ykyk) because i thought he deserved something like that for him being such a great person in my life and then he saved them in chat and i was fine with it just a tiny bit and then called to do some things. my stepmom came home and i thought she was gonna do her usual things after work but she came into my room and i panicked a bit and put my phone under the blanket. she asked what i'm doing and where my phone is, i said i was watching a show and then she came over to ask for the phone and i got extremely scared and my boyfriend heard everything, i had a grip on my phone and just clarifying my birth mom bought me the phone. she ripped the phone out of my hands and it hurt and she stormed off. i felt tears going down my face so fast and i knew it wasn't gonna end well. a few minutes later my dad called and was yelling at me threatening to smash my phone while i was watching and say some racist things to people in my class because i'm pretty sure he thought i sent the stuff to someone in my class. while my dad was yelling at me it was on my stepmoms phone so i logged into my snapchat and deleted all the things and i later found my dad most likely threatening my boyfriend through texts. my stepsister knows her way around snapchat so she went through basically everything and i got asked my eyes only password but i didn\u2019t have anything there, she asked for the password for the account so i said i forgot and i really did so she reset it and i quickly changed it to something else. i got my phone taken away, my playstation station away with the headset and everything. they added a tracker onto my phone so i wasn't allowed any social media which really lead to no communication with anyone at all. i got told i could have my playstation back if i made friends an my dad went one by one unadding all of my online friends, it felt like i lost everyone. we had a history of moving houses a lot so i made friends prior onlin since i didn't have the thought of losing them but it happened. i went to the school counsellor because all the stuff that happened but i didn't go into detail and my dad and stepmom didn't like it exactly because my mom got involved sometimes. i did find a way to text my boyfriend but it was very minimal. i told my mom i hated how everything changed and i missed her. my parents never got along and fought over custody and i would spend like around a month with her every year. i had plans to leave the town with my moms help. i felt like i was being forced into interactions because of my stepmom and it hurt me a lot since she said she was just raising me right. before i let the town she arranged a party at a bowling alley for my whole class, i didn't want that and never agreed to it. about a month after i got my phone taken i took off the location tracker and woke up early and packed up two suitcases and a backpack and i called a taxi to the airport. my mom bought me a flight ticket and next thing i knew i was with my mom and i felt 100 times better than i did before. my dad called and called asking where i was and i said i was with \"friends\". i visited my best friend i didn't see for two years and my family on my mothers side and i gained access to talking to my boyfriend regularly again and still talk to him to this day. i feel happier than i was before.\nI just really want to know if i did the right thing and what people think about this.",

You know damn well if it was a male teacher and a female student you\u2019d be fucking irate. But if it\u2019s a woman raping a male student THATS FUCKING JUSTIFIABLE?! ITS FUCKING RAPE!! THERE IS SO MUCH PSYCHOLOGICAL FUCKING TORMENT THAT GOES WITH BEING RAPED!! \n\nIf you\u2019re one of those justifiers and you fucking comment I\u2019m gonna bully the absolute fuck out of you. I\u2019m going to tear you down to your lowest goddamn form and make you confront what you are, a low life pedophillic scum bag. You look in the mirror and face the fact that your mother can\u2019t stomach the sight of you. You\u2019ll die alone. No one to love you. Not even an animal. No one will fucking love you, no one will want to be associated with you. You\u2019ll walk your miserable waste of a life knowing you\u2019re the lowest form of societal ass. Fuck you and fuck your entire fucking bloodline. If I had a fucking time machine I\u2019d go back to your first ancestor and wipe your entire genetic data out of the fucking Gene pool. Fuck you",

My boyfriend was at a concert a few months ago and some girl came up behind him and just started touching him and stroking his back and he was pretty fucking uncomfortable but didn't know what to do. Eventually when she didn't get the attention she was looking for a she moved on to a different man. Not one person at this entire concert thought to say something to her or stop her even though she was clearly making both of them uncomfortable. It's insane to me that things like this just go without consequence so often. There was even an askmen post yesterday asking men were you ever sexually assaulted and how did it happen and there were so many men in those comments with some really disgusting and vile stories where there were no repercussions for these women. It's absolutely fucking disgusting",

Luckily I\u2019ve yet to get any \u201cyou should be happy\u201d comments but I have gotten \u201chow does that happen?\u201d \n\nIn my specific instance it was molestation. Inappropriate and unwanted touching is assault. I was asleep and woke up to it by someone I had considered my best friend at the time. \n\nYears later and I still get scared when going to events near me bc she still lives in the same city. I stalk any followers I get that I know are local to make sure they\u2019re not friends with her. I struggle with PTSD, specifically dissociative subset, and used to have really really bad dissociative episodes. It\u2019s terrifying to be afraid and not understand why you are, and in extreme cases I can feel her hands on me and feel like I\u2019m back in the moment in current danger. \n\nShe ruined my fucking life. PTSD entirely rewires your brain, and it\u2019s possible to \u201crewire\u201d it back through EMDR but that\u2019s a process. Ptsd can also cause both brain and physical damage. Many ppl will struggle with it their whole lives.",

That's going to fuck him up and they play it off like no big deal, even calling the young boy \"lucky\"... Women will do this too if the perpetrator is good looking (I found this also happens with murderers). Do these people not hear themselves? Why would you be jealous of someone being manipulated and harmed? It will only make other young kids feel like they can not come out and ask for help if this happens to them. We really need to be careful with our words and how we approach these topics, but I honestly can't understand how or why you'd want to make a joke about this or make light of it.",

            "comment": "I totally agree with you. My son was raped at 14, by a 28 year old female who was a family friend. She was married, with one child. She ended up getting pregnant by my son but had an abortion. I wanted to kill her so bad, but she wasn't worth it. She is a registered sex offender for life, but I wanted her to go to prison.\n\nI will never forgive her for doing that. She ended up divorcing, her husband filed. Of course, no one on her husband's side believed it. Said my son and I were liars. I was like whatever. I know, my son knows, and God knows. I hope she Burns in hell.\n\nI often find myself thinking what if that was her daughter that was raped by a 28 year old man. And she had the nerve to tell me my son was the best she'd ever had. It made me sick to my stomach. I felt like a failure is the mother, hopeless, depressed, and wishing all kinds of vengeful things on her and even wishing her daughter got molested. I know in my heart that was wrong of me, because her daughter had nothing to do with it, if that's where my dark mind took me.  I truly pray to God that nothing ever happens to her daughter though. I wouldn't wish something like that on anybody.\n\nMy son tells me to let it go, that it wasn't my fault, and he doesn't blame me. It's just hard to get over something like that.\n\nSo, I know for a fact, that women can rape boys or men. It's just sad that society doesn't see it that way.",

My client base was 99:1 women/men (I had maybe 3 male clients), and they really struggled more than many women who generally feel more free to open up. \n\nPeople also don\u2019t understand rape is about power and control, humiliation, degradation\u2026. not sex. \n\nSo TLDR, many people are ignorant and hateful, and want to stay that way.",

I told him my daughter doesn\u2019t like to be hugged like that and he went \u2018oh,she doesn\u2019t mind this (another hug)\u2019. \n\nRegardless of whether that dude was a predator, I thought my daughter that it\u2019s more than ok to feel and say you don\u2019t like something an adult is doing and to challenge the adult. We talked about the situation after and how uncomfortable it had made her. I said it was wrong, when he didn\u2019t respect personal boundaries, but it was good it had made her uncomfortable and to remember that feeling. That feeling is a cue to gtfo\n\nSigh.

Rape cases very rarely even make it to court and so, those convicted are almost *never* innocent. Then I hope they run their mouths about what they did and get killed in there instead.\n\nLike that one monster that bragged about how he raped a little girl and his cellmate just happened to be that little girl\u2019s uncle and he fucked him UP.",

Nowadays women can claim false rape charges and even if proven false it still ruins a man's life forever. There was an incident where this happened. But because of this, most men do not wish to even confront women in fear of backlash to their own lives. The extremists will turn things around and make it the mans fault. Its very sad but true. If you look at findings and do research you will find that women do get a lot more than men and that includes leeway in this. Its a very fragile situation that can't be easily dealt with.\n\nDon't let this comment mislead you, im all for equal rights and the such, im just not for people who take it to extreme measures.",

But that\u2019s simply a misrepresentation of statistics. I pulled up a great article from Washington post about the hidden numbers in rape statistics.\nI also said holding those numbers up against each other, to discredit women, are the reason women don\u2019t come forward when they are being raped, often repeatedly and often by people close to them.\n\nHe got very angry and very nasty and discredited himself. \n\nBut worse was a female Redditor slamming me because who the fuck was I to speak for women\u2026she knew that women were full of shit about rape.\nI obvs blocked them.\n\n\nSome Women are just great at slamming women to get approval from misogynist assholes. And they make me despair more than those men do\n\n\n\u2026oh and before I blocked him he said that he\u2019s much rather be raped than falsely accused of rape so the crime of falsely accusing is worse than raping another human being.",

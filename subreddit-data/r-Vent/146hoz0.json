    "postText": "I\u2019m a 27 yo female and i am terrified of aging. Long story short, i haven\u2019t lived my life the way my peers have. I never went out clubbing, had a serious boyfriend, traveled.. I literally feel like a 16 yo because of my lack of experience. The thing is, I feel lost. I don\u2019t relate to ppl my age because i feel like they\u2019re more \u201cmature\u201d than me but I don\u2019t relate to ppl younger than me because even though I look very young, I\u2019m extremely insecure about my age and feel judged when younger ppl find out how old I am. I still want to experience everything i missed out on but I feel like an imposter somehow. My mind can\u2019t move on past the years that were forcefully taken from me. I\u2019m just about to begin everything from scratch whilst others have already finished. I try very hard to move on but this is something that is constantly on my mind. I don\u2019t fit in anywhere and it\u2019s exhausting.",

Still I think a lot of people 'our age' (late 20s) are the same we're just sort of scattered around doing random stuff, so don't get discouraged. It's really not too late to do any of that.",

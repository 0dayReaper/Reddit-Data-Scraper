You know what made me better? \nI met someone completely out of the blue... someone who openly told me they didn\u2019t know what the point of life was or what their purpose was. This person had overcome a lot and was doing amazing in life. They had routines and were healthy as could be... anyways when this person walked into my life they literally inspired me to change and be more like them. They made me fight for myself by their example from overcoming heart ache, loss, and addiction. \nThey said they didn\u2019t know what their purpose was but little did they know that an inch of their purpose was to help me unknowingly. I\u2019m grateful I met them everyday. \n\nWe inspire one another everyday... we just don\u2019t always know it. We make strangers days better just by a simple a gesture. We have all kinds of purpose and it\u2019s to help one another... it\u2019s just not obvious or always meant for us to know but it exists and that\u2019s why we exist. \n\nWhen you feel low, do something for someone. Expect nothing in return... just help someone out and it will make you feel so much better. Not to mention what goes around comes around. \n\nHead up!",

That really messed me up for a long long time and it drove me to nearly committing suicide lots of times. And last year, i met an old classmate who apparently had feelings for me until now. At first i only thought that ok were gonna be friends because i wasn't looking for a relationship that time. After a month of catching up, she said she had been waiting for me for the last 3 years (because we used to flirt a little before i met my ex) and i was surprised cause we havent talked for a long time. We didn't jump to a relationship right after that confession but we caught upcwith eachother and before taking anything forward, i told her about my past experience and my mental illness because i dodnt want her to receive unexpected issues mid-relationship. I cannot express enough how thankful i am for her cause she accepted the entire me and makes me feel so loved every single minute of my life. She always finds time for me even through her studies. She supports me in every choice i make and corrects me if i do anything wrong. I love her more and more with every day and night passing. Shes what inspires me to get up in the morning and do something for myself and for the future i want. She doesn't even ask for herself to be a part of my future; she just supports me in everything. I want her to be the one i get to spend my life with. Youre completely correct with everything you said in your post. We dont know it and we might never know of it but a lot of people know and care about us. Ur really cool :)",

I came across a post of (what I remembered to be) her boyfriend with a different girl. I clicked myself through to my friend's profile to see what she's been up to and if she's okay considering there apparently had been a breakup. All I saw was people posting about their grief on her timeline. She killed herself last year.\n\nIt honestly hit me like a ton of bricks. We met in different circumstances and our lives weren't similar or aligned at all, but when we spent some time together, she was so cool and happy, like she really had her life together. I was often too shy to approach her or hang out with her because she seemed so out of my (platonical) league. I haven't been great at texting her back either because I didn't know what to say. Now I feel absolutely deflated.\n\nIf anybody reads this who feels like killing themselves because nobody cares, please don't think that. I've hung out with her for a very limited time, then lost touch three years ago, and I'm still gutted. People will miss you, even if it's random ones that you hardly remember anymore.",

I honestly don't like messages like OPs because it comes from a mentality of \"everyones struggle is the same\"\n\nLike OP talks about the small ppl but when I worked I was overnight at a hotel so no fav customers, I started rolling my own cigs cuz I had to stop going to shops where the cashier started considering me a regular due to my anxiety and depression. It felt like an obligation to fake happiness or try not to look as dirty and that was too much to handle. Eventually I ran out of gas stations and small shops. I've been stuck in my house since before pandemic and I seriously doubt anyone out there would notice me gone. Even most of my fam wouldn't care, the rest would be sad but no one's life will change except my sis and mom... Maybe dad\n\nThat said, what helped me the most was when I was getting serious and bought a gun just in case. It was only a 22 and after shooting it I realized it was way to small caliber for a clean end. But I still have it as a reminder I got through worse times. And if my life ever gets bad enough I would even consider using it, nothing else could possibly help. \n\nNowadays it's used as an excuse to get me hiking. I find a nice secluded spot then hike with a friend and shoot at things we bring like old textbooks and stupid shit\n\n\nBut what truly brought me happiness was joining the war against the 1%. The movement, the cause, the community, the money made, and the money to come. I've never been so content with myself and I finally feel like my disease won't hole me back from moving out this time",

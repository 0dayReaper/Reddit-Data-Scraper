    "postText": "Being a pedophile is not okay in anyway. There is nothing good about being a pedophile and if you are one and trying to show that it is okay, stop. Pedophiles dont belong in any communities, especially not the LGBTQ+ community. Being part of the community is attraction to same sex, not wanting sex, not having a select gender, being your authentic self. It's not showing attraction to a child. That's disgusting. If anyone thinks it is okay please don't talk to me, find help and dont try to hide that with a community that is all about pride. There is no pride in being a pedophile. If people are trying to accept it in LGBTQ then might as well add attraction to animals. It wont happen cause it's wrong just like pedophilia. The LGBTQ community has it hard enough in this world as it is, we dont want to be associated with pedophilia. No one does. Again if you have thought of children in a sexual manner, find help. That is not normal. Dont normalize it. There are laws set in place to prevent sexual acts against children for a reason. So it is absolutely wrong to think that way\n\n\nEdit: I want to say that everyone's comments are very good. I want to thank the survivors in the comments that had enough courage to talk about this hard subject. I understand that pedophilia is considered a disease to some and I think it is to. Yet it doesn't feel right to place them in the LGBTQIA community. Pedophilia is an attraction to a range of ages. Many of you have compared therapy for a pedophile to conversion therapy and that truly shouldn't be compared. There is only one thing that is similar between the two. It sometimes has no affect or doesnt work for long. I understand that can control it but either way they come to someone and tell them there is more of a chance they will never talk to them again. It is a big lose lose for them. \n\n\nThank you for so many upvotes. It's the most I've ever gotten. Hope you all have a good day and happy holidays",

If they see that there's something wrong with them, want to get better,  and don't diddle kids they should be fine (if they do get help that is) and should be treated like normal people. \n\nBut the ones that do traumatise children, and know what the fuck they're doing is bad and still do it deserve worse than death. They deserve to get locked up somewhere and get tortured until they fucking die.\n\nAlso I'm really fucking angry that female pedophiles get away with raping a fucking child just because they're women and \"the kid should've enjoyed it\".

LGBTQ+ just covers those outside of the hetero-normative. \n\nThe important take away here is: __Queer or not, sexuality refers to gender. Pedophilia refers to age.__ \n\nAs soon as the child ages, a pedophile won't feel the same attraction anymore. It's a preference, at most. __A preference isn't a sexuality__ - just as being into blondes isn't a sexuality. \n\nAlso: A pedophile isn't \"into\" the child as a person. As a survivor - your personality, your experiences, your interests etc. don't matter. You barely had time to collect all those things that make you up, which an adult has a lifetime to do. A child isn't a whole person yet and we need to stop pretending like pedophiles care to meet a partner on their level.\n\nYou can have respect for people who chose to get help _and_ not condone pedophilia nonetheless. You can acknowledge the fact that most child molesters aren't necessarily pedophilic without claiming it would be a \"sexuality\". It's not mutually exclusive. \n\nYou say you don't want to normalize pedophilia - yet you do. Blurring the lines like you are trying to do here can be potentially dangerous.",

Taking pedophilia and putting it as a sexuality will normalize it and put a whole new look on the LGBTQ community as a community that will take in illegal sexual behaviors. I know it's not a choice but it can be helped to suppress the feelings they have.\n\n\nBut comparing the things that gay people gone through, and still go through, to what people with pedophilic thoughts want to be apart of shouldn't be a thing. This \"map sexuality\" has been leaked into politics and Trump was going to limit adoption to same sex couples cause he associated \"maps\" with the rest of the LGBTQ community. Being gay has nothing to do with being attracted to children. LGBTQ community are still fighting for trans rights and if someone is curious about helping, they will research LGBTQ community and they will see pedophilia in that a completely change their mind. \n\n\nTo me if it is normalized in anyway then it will effect childrens thought on an adult touching them and effect people's view of the LGBTQ community. There still isn't alot of rights for the community and if \"maps\" keep associating with the community, we may never get the rights. \n\n\nIf it isn't normalized then less people will feel the urges. Also the population and crimes of pedophilia will go down. There won't be anything to slow down new support for the LGBTQ community and will no children will question whether it is wrong or not that an adult is touching them",

I do not believe that pedophilia is a good thing to practice in any way, shape or form, but like others have said, they can't control who they like. I'm sure you can relate, because I am sure that bad people in your life have ridiculed you for being LGBTQIA(They call it that now, lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer intersex asexual) even though it was not your choice in any way. I have felt this from telling friends to the point that I'm not even going to tell my parents. 2. They most likely would want to be not a pedophile, because they would have a hard time with  sexual stuff, and they would probably not want to engage in sexual activity with a child. 3. Correct me if I'm wrong, I don't know a ton about this, but isn't LGBTQIA just anyone that is not heterosexual? If so, then, by definition, they would be LGBTQIA. Again, this is coming from a mostly closeted kind of bisexual,(I like women and men but will only have sexual activity with women) so I am not going to be saying this as an F you to the LGBTQIA community.",

Cause of the fact the pedophilia is a range of age instead of being a range of gender, nonconforming genders, etc. I know they dont want to be one and it is hard to talk about this since I'm not a survivor but many people see it as having control instead of being with a child. Some have it cause they can control it, I get that. When I came out I felt relief and I was happier with who I was. If someone came out as \"map\" I dont think people would like that and they would feel even worse about their situation. I have been ridiculed for being nonbinary and pan yes, but not as much as a \"map\" would if someone knew about them. Pedophilia gives of a uneasy feeling and makes everyone think the person has or tried to touch a child.",

I think the normalization that some industries are doing is downright disgusting, and pedophiles in general - are disgusting.\n\nHowever, let me correct you on one thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is no \"help\" for a pedophile. They cannot simply see a therapist. It's too nerve-wracking and could lead to legal troubles. Have you met a therapist that is able to tolerate a pedophile? To listen to their sick obsessions? Their sexual fantasies with a minor? There is not a single one. They cannot simply 'let go' of these feelings, either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA pedophile finds it acceptable to have a sexual attraction to children. Why?\n\nThe ones I've met are usually desperate men who lack communication skills. They tried their luck with girls over the age of 18 to no avail. The constant rejection, neglect and abuse that they may have endured in their life is what led them to their decision to have sexual relations with a minor.\n\nAlternatively, they could have a porn addiction, and continue to seek out more vile and dangerous things to meet their sexual desires. This is unfortunately a more common reason, and thus, I truly despise the porn industry for it enabling this behavior. The loli H-anime industry does not help either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir relationship with a minor would start with someone that's a little younger than 18, probably 15-17. Then, they eventually grow deeper into their obsession.\n\nMales tend to like someone younger than them. Females tend to like someone older. That's the way life is.\n\nEventually, that pedophile ends up becoming more abusive with his power. Somewhat of a \"fuck it\" moment, as they're already doing something illegal to begin with.\n\nThey move to an even lower age. An age to where they can easily manipulate them to do whatever they please. Someone under 13.\n\nThat addiction continues, and continues, and eventually turns into a full blown case of \"this dude is extremely dangerous to children\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat is where kidnapping starts, then rape, then murder.\n\nThen they're either arrested or end up killing themselves.\n\nAnd thus, the cycle of a pedophile is complete.\n\nA vile, sickening cycle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is very sad that we can't help these people for their sickening fantasies. It does not help that we now live in a society where young girls are pressured through social media to look 'fleek' or 'beautiful' or what-have-you.\n\nIt's scary. Truly haunting, even.\n\nIt's a dangerous world out there.\n\nPlease protect your children. They're far more prevalent than you're lead on to believe.",

That\u2019s disgusting dude. Chemical castration doesn\u2019t always work, there is no guarantee that they \u201cwon\u2019t do shit.\u201d They still have hands even if their dick won\u2019t stand up. There are female pedophiles that use their hands and objects. There are reoffenders after chemical castration. There are pedophiles living more than comfortable lives right now and they don\u2019t deserve all the chances that the government gives them. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re defending them. This makes you look like a pedophile sympathizer. Especially because this post is 160 days old. So stop trying to convince me that pedophile lives are worth something or worth reforming. You\u2019re wrong. They are the absolute scum of the earth and should be put to death. The world would be a better place if they weren\u2019t around. Probably would be a better place because less infants would be raped.",

            "comment": "In case my writing is going to invite misunderstanding, I'd like to emphasize that my point being that I want to help rehabilitate non-acting pedophiles and at the same time I fully support prosecuting child rapists and molestors to the full extend of the law.\n\nNow, I'd like to begin with the problem that I see in this pedophile problem.\n\nPedophiles are not the same as Child Molestors\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1) Pedophiles are mentally ill people who have sexual attraction to minors.\n\n2) Child rapists / molestors are people who act on their sexual attraction on minors.\n\nPedophilia is an illness. And \"pedophiles\" are people with said illness. And the non-acting ones? they need help.\n\nThe people who have pedophilia and then act on their sexual desires, on the other hand, should be called the real name of what they should be called - \"child rapists\" and \"child molestors\".\n\nMedical Problem and Moral Problem\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nI feel that this distinction is important. Because if a person suffers pedophilia and let the medical experts know (because they know something is wrong with them and they are seeking help), they will be medically labeled as \"pedophiles\" and identified as such. And if we then demonize them, it makes us less human and condoning injustice.\n\nThe pedophiles - and I mean the non-acting ones are most likely quite aware that there is something wrong with them. But try searching up any help on the net, there's very little help offered to aid them to keep this demon under control. But there are a lot of people want them dead.\n\nI feel that as a human community, we should help these non-acting ones that are brave enough to come out to seek help - help them rehabilitate, provide proposals in how to help them stay away from children but still function in the society, and etc.\n\nPedophilia is a medical problem, not a moral one. And we should approach it as such.\n\nBut Child Rapists? They are a moral problem.\n\nThey knew they have issues. They didn't try to seek help to solve it. Instead, they go for the illegal means to do it. In other words, they had a choice to not act on it; and yet, they still do it anyway.\n\nTherefore, to deal with these ones, we should approach it as a moral problem. These ones, who pillaged and destroyed children's lives, should face the full consequences the law could dish on them. \n\nPedophiles Do Not Belong In LGBTQIA\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd yes, keeping pedophilia out of LGBTQIA community is important. \n\nBecause pedophilia is an illness. Not a sexuality. And normalizing pedophilic notions shouldn't be the way we deal with it. Instead, we should deal with this by ensuring treatment is properly carried out.\n\nIndeed, there's the argument that so far our current medical tech is not capable of fully curing these people, so it's hopeless in trying to treat these people. \n\nBut as fellow compassionate human beings, I'd like to extend these questions to you all - if a patient with terminal stage cancer asked us to help him, do we opt to not give him treatment because \"it is almost impossible to cure him\"? Do we forfeit the life of an AIDS patient who still has the will to live? Do we give up and let Covid-19 kills us all? \n\nI hope your answer is \"No, we won't give up a human who needs and seeks help from us\". \n\nIMPORTANT\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nIn case my point gets missed from the long post, I'd like to stress again that I'm proposing help for Pedophiles (patients), *not for Child Rapists (criminals)*. So, if you feel that I'm defending these criminals, be assured that I am not and will never do so.",

I think if it\u2019s truly something that can\u2019t be helped, then their shit out of luck because they have to live their lives finding ways to not act upon it; however, I do believe that therapy can damn near cure them.\n\nIn my childhood, I had to reconcile and learn not to engage in that behavior as a perpetrator. Not all the abuse was painful or immediately traumatizing. When I was a toddler, I would try and be sexual with other kids. I did not know that it wasn\u2019t normal. So, with that experience and then being counseled for it in my later teen years, I learned a lot about the self.\n\nPedophiles were abused themselves, they learned to get satisfaction and a thrill from children. Therapy and really unpacking their own traumas and abuse will mostly likely reveal that children are a surrogate. They may spend the rest of their life being able to picture a child sexually, but that won\u2019t be a desire any longer considering they gain nothing. Because truly sexually abusing a child gives you nothing.",

It\u2019s not meant to be a malicious correction either\u2014 just an overall response.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but not all pedophiles were abused themselves. There\u2019s a chunk that have been, but those folks can helped via therapy, through methods to help them reconcile their past with their feelings and to learn not to hurt kids.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a chunk of pedophiles who aren\u2019t doing it because of a misguided attraction they learned as a child. There\u2019s a chunk who are doing it because it gives them power over something smaller, more dependent, and entirely less capable than they are. More often than not, it\u2019s entirely based off of /just/ that, it\u2019s the power trip that does it for them\u2014 not the kid themselves.\n\nThis was one of the things I had to learn as a survivor. It wasn\u2019t me and was never me, because someone had decided that I, a child, was the perfect target. Not an attraction, not genuinely wanting to be with me\u2014 which is still a crime nonetheless\u2014 but because they wanted to hurt and harm me to feel like they were better. There\u2019s multiple forms of offending pedophiles and this is one of the major ones. Otherwise, it\u2019s down to how their brain chemistry is wired, in which case they should quite frankly be chemically/medically castrated.",

It could have been me, but he was 12 years older than me and didn't live with us for other reasons.  I hate pedophiles and am disgusted by them.

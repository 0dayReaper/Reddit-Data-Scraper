    "postText": "This is a very specific frustration and I've made a new account to start writing more about my frustrations in the area. I added the TW because a lot of this rant has to do with my struggle to lose weight which (for me) is also inextricably linked to eating disorders and self image. I've been fat my entire life and cant remember a time in my life where I wasn't the biggest person among my friends and immediate acquaintances. At one point I lost over 200 pounds but have gained about half of it back in the last 3 or so years. \n\nMy biggest struggle is with actually making myself go to the gym, or take walks more, or eat more nutritiously. Going to the doctor makes me want to absolutely scream because every doctor talks about doing all of these things as if they're simple steps I can walk out of the office and immediately start doing. Online forums are usually pretty similar; comments always languidly say things like \"just go to the gym\" or \"just lose weight\" as if its the easiest thing. When I ask people about their building up a gym routine the answer is almost always some variation on \"I just made myself start going.\" I have no idea what this means cognitively. I don't understand how I can just make myself do something when the will to do it is just not arriving for me. I don't understand how, when I've gotten my gym clothes on, bag packed, and still struggle to actually get up and go what brain buttons I need to push to \"make\" myself do it. \n\nThe heart of the rant: I've been trying to find motivational content that helps me find a way to go since just making myself by raw force of will isn't working. But so so so SO much of the content about self improvement and building a fitness routine leads to different social media platforms recommending me Andrew Tate type nonsense. I made a throwaway tiktok account last week to test this -- liking just 3 videos about finding a gym routine made my entire for you page misogynistic content with few exceptions. \n\nEven worse, it seems like, for some people, a chauvinist  with a podcast mic telling them to go to the gym is all the motivation they need. I find myself feeling deeply jealous of misogynists for having such a reliable stream of content capable of motivating them to actually change they're lives. It makes me sick that some of the communities with stewards of physical fitness are also the ones that spread so much hatred and vitriol. \n\nI just want to search around and find ways to motivate myself to lose weight without getting recommended Alpha Male podcasts and scores of videos that just don't fit my morals at all. My left-leaning friends tell me being fat is fine even when I want to lose weight and my doctors urge me to. And the non left-leaning places promote fitness via toxic masculinity. I hate this. ",

            "comment": "Whoa. What a fascinating observation. Can I ask, are you a male? I\u2019m curious because I haven\u2019t picked up on this, but I\u2019m a cisgender woman and I\u2019m realizing my searches related to fitness are, like, probably different. Maybe. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry you feel this way. You didn\u2019t ask for tips, but I noticed you did express frustration about not getting helpful advice around working out even after asking friends. I\u2019m happy to give advice if you\u2019d like it. You can DM if so. \n\nI am actually a fit person, but I absolutely loathe working out. Before you eyeroll, I basically was hoodwinked into sports as a child\u2026 as a people pleaser and a way to try to bond with a stepparent, I picked up their hobby. I did it for positive interaction, even though I hated the sport. Everything about it. Practicing on my own. Even practicing. The feeling of exertion. Runner\u2019s high? Sure, I\u2019ve gotten it, but like\u2026 1 out of 79 times. \n\nBecause I played sports early on, which carried through into college, I think (??) I built up sort of a baseline that has allowed me to cut corners more as an adult. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s science to it. \n\nI\u2019m sharing this with you because I\u2019ve done both extremes: I\u2019ve spent countless hours training, and I\u2019ve also spent time very sedentary with bad eating habits. I\u2019ve gone to the gym and\u2026 not worked out. Just sort of weakly tried a thing then got mad and left. I\u2019ve tried that pre workout stuff and it helps, but it\u2019s deeply disturbing to me to get methy and workout. So for me, I\u2019ve found it important to (1) realize workouts don\u2019t have to be some sort of monumental thing and (2) gamify them somehow, anyhow. \n\nI\u2019ll never, ever be someone who works out every day, or on a schedule, or even consistently. I will never consider the gym \u201cmy happy place.\u201d Anyway, I wish you good luck and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having a tough go of it.",

            "comment": "What helped me the most was just accepting that I would go, despite my feelings.  My feelings were still there, almost like an annoying little kid whining to get their way.  But I did the workout anyway.  And every single time, after the work out...the little kid was quiet.  I started noticing how just because the feeling shows up.. doesn't mean it's the boss.  The tasks will happen either way.  A couple months into it and the little kid stopped showing up.",

            "comment": "Going to the gym for me, is not a matter of \"do I feel like it\". Who the fuck feels like going 4-5x in the week and giving 110% not me. I'd rather go home, game or play an instrument.\n\nBut for me it is not an option. I have been hurt for my appearance when I was young. I was very overweight and I felt the struggle that came with it. Rejections from girls. Guys also mocking me for being fat. Always the guy that was picked on. The guy that needed protection from the teachers, because it was sad to pick on the fat kid.\n\nMotivation is just a spark to get started. Motivation will run out. During New Year many people hit the gym, and stop after 3 months. They all had high motivation, but it runs out. \n\nFor you, you don't need motivation my friend. You need discipline. To do something, even if you don't feel like it. The pros were far greater for me than the cons of doing this whole fitness thing. I get treated better, girls talk to me, I make friends more easily, clothes look good on me and my oversized clothes also look good on me. My jawline would show with this Lower fat percentage and I would get good attention from men and women. \n\nI wish I could give you the magic trick to go to the gym. But I can't. You just have to want it bad enough.  I went through a phase I wanted it so bad, I would scream during homeworkouts pushing myself. In the public gym I also push myself till failure.\n\nI hope you don't read this ans get offended. If you truly want it bad enough, and I mean truly, then you will do it. You will sacrifice maybe time with friends, time with a game or another hobby, just to go to the gym. I am not saying that is good or wrong, I'm just saying that is what people do that are very busy, maybe you are busy?\n\nFor me, I don't game anymore. I don't play the piano and read as much, because I am in the gym. And for me, I sacrificed those things and I am fine with it. For other people, it isn't ok and that is 100% justified. You need to do what brings you happiness. If you dread going to the gym, then don't. There are plenty of other ways to lose weight, you know? I go to the gym purely because it's a mental and physical game for me. Able to push past my limits and bit personal records. It just feels very good when you never were able to lift a certain weight, and then boom you did it. Feels more satisfying then winning a game, for me.",

                            "comment": "If reading this irritates you, then I don't think someone can help you with nice words to hit the gym and loss weight man. Showing my jawline is not me shoving down masculinity, it's just a sign of health. When women have a nice jawline, it shows health. Model Agency select their models based on several criteria, and jawline is one of them. Nothing to do with masculinity.\n\nI stand by what I said. You don't have to accept it. I'm just sharing my side of the story and it's up to you if you are willing to be open to it and listen why I think like this. But as you said, you get irritated and frustrated by it. If that is true, then do you really think the issue is from the people saying the stuff like what I'm saying? Of course, you may not agree with me, but that is a whole different story. I don't agree what your saying and I am not irritated by you.\n\nLosing weight is a mental game. Losing weight is easy, yes I said it. Eat less calories than you burn, that's it. It's not magic. The hard part is your mentality. The hard part is keep doing it over and over again. And yes, I mean it: If you truly want it bad enough, you will do it.\n\nYou probably heard this quote before: \"If you want it as bad enough, as you want to breath, then you will be successful.\"\n\nIf you get drowned by 20 guys, your only wish is to breath. You won't nothing else, but to breath. If you want to lose weight just as much as you want to breath, you will find a way. Again, if this irritates you, then I truly think the problem is with you. I am not promoting some toxic masculinity bull crap.\n\nThe jawline thing, goes for women too. Wanting it bad enough, is for women too. Nothing what I am saying is directed for men and for toxic masculinity. I have friends that are chubby, they hit the gym and stop and eat chips and come with excuses why they are not in the gym and on their caloric deficit. \"I'll do it next week, I'm not feeling it today\". Do you think this game is easy, where you can just say that? And when someone like me, points out that you can do that, then you get irritated? \n\nYou know this is hard, and when people like me tell you that it is indeed hard and you need to work hard for it, and there will be great benefits from your work (jawline example for men and women), you'll get mad? What do you want me to say?",

    "postText": "I have huffed about my partner's mother (MIL) before, but today is for the Father (FIL).\n\nMy partner is transitioning FTM. They have been my pal for +12 years at this point. To say I care is probably an understatement.\n\nBoth this person's parents (divorced) are equally unsupportive, anti-trans, bible-thumpers.\n\nI got an email this morning from FIL: \"Send me a picture of this bearded abomination you are married to.  \"&lt;PARTNER&gt;\".  Freakin' unbelievable.  Thank you.\"\n\nThis was this morning. I have been filled with a fury I can't describe all day.\n\nSir. This is your child. How dare you be such a dick to your own flesh and blood. Your bigoted reaction to their newfound identity is SO validating for them cutting you out of their life.\n\nI want to respond.\n\nI want to scream.\n\nI want to co-miserate with my partner (even though they'll explicitly told me to not tell them unless prompted about exactly things like this).\n\nI don't have people I can vent to about this. So I am thankful for this subreddit for me to huff about it.\n\nAs much as I want to retaliate, i know silence is a better poison to this momster. Robbing him of my reaction and any chance to justify his religious fervor is probably the best vengeance I can get.",

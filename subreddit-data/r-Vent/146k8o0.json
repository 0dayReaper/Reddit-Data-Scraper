    "postText": "I'm a uni student financially dependent on my father because 1) minors are expected to focus on academics in my culture 2) I'm an international student and the tuition is insane.\n\nMy family's dynamics changed significantly when I was 16 because my parents had a major fallout. Neither of them want to divorce each other because of societal expectations and basically I have to bridge the gap in communication a lot. This took a toll on me when it started, but now I have no tears left and frankly don't care anymore that my parents dislike each other.\n\nBut now my mom wants to stay with me since she can't stand being in the same house as my dad. She lived with me for an entire year (during uni) and I liked having her there because I truly love both my parents to death.\n\nShe left for 4 months and I realized how much I truly enjoy being by myself. I mean, a 21 year old sharing a room and bed with her mom gets tiring at some point. I also got to make my own decisions and schedule, hang out with friends, watch whatever I want, stay up late stuying, etc.\n\nWhen she's here she nitpicks at things and makes me anxious. If I want to go out with friends she'll make me eat a meal first, then I'm very late. Or she'll want to hang out in the vicinity.\n\nMy degree is very demanding, it has a reputation for being so. Its hard to get stuff done because my mom can't sleep with the lights on, and I study late into the night. She is also very sensitive and often gets headaches, nausea, back pains, mood swings, and 80% of our conversations become her venting to me.\n\nShe wants to come back and stay with me again for the next 8 months and I don't think I can do it. I've tried telling her gently that studying is hard with 2 ppl in one matchbox of a room. She said ok at first, then asked again a day later.\n\nI already feel like a terrible person denying her, so I said yes. I guess I can kiss peace of mind goodbye for now. \n\nI don't know when this cycle will end. I love her, but I need my space.",

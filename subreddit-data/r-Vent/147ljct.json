    "postText": "TL:DR: Had a really shitty airport clerk who wasted a lot of time, got cleared in 2 minutes by another one less than a meter away.\n\nWent to see my girlfriend off at the airport today for a redeye flight at 5am. We arrive at 2:30am, and the baggage loading is supposed to open at 3:00am, but they wait until 3:40 to open it. Fine, it's annoying, but whatever. \n\nWe wait in line for 15 minutes, and some crotchety old lady sees us (will be referred to as \"the bitch\"). My girlfriend needs to check her bags and get her boarding pass, but this bitch makes her hand type a URL and fill out some strange form do all this bullshit that I've never heard of, then says we need a negative COVID test from the last 48 hours or she can't fly. I tell the bitch it's 4am and we're 15 miles from the nearest grocery store. She shrugs, and I walk around the airport trying to find something, no luck. I return back, and my girlfriend is on the verge of tears because her flight was really expensive, and she has to renew her visa tomorrow, and there is less than 1 hour till takeoff.\n\nWe look up the actual policy she's citing for the 48 hour COVID test and it's 2 years out of date. We tell her this and she says she still can't let my girlfriend go because she \"knows she doesn't have a negative test.\" So I just say loudly \"let's just talk to someone else.\" And we move literally to the person right next the bitch and get checked out in 3 minutes, and don't get hassled at all.\n\nFuck you for making my girlfriend cry. Fuck you for wasting my time. Fuck you for giving my girlfriend all this shit because she's Asian. You will never amount to anything, you worthless human being. You're already in your 60s and still working as an airport clerk. Have fun working until you die making minimum wage you heartless bitch.",

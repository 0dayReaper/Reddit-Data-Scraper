It's a part of my job to ask for ID when someone is trying to buy liquor, smokes etc. I can't accept a picture of it because there's nothing for me to scan! It's not rocket science for crying out loud! And don't get all pissy with me when i ask you for your ID, it's my job and you FUCKING know it!",

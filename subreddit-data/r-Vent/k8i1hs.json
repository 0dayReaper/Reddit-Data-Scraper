It's hard man I miss her and I regret some of my behavior as a daughter but I know she was proud of me and loved me with her whole heart and did the best she could to be a good parent. \n\nThink back on all the memories you have with your mom. Which ones do you remember the best, the clearest? The good ones. And so does she. I can assure you that she went to bed that night with love in her heart for you and your family. And even if she's not here with you physically, you know that she's with you. I don't know what you believe in but I've noticed little things that happen when I miss her the most that are just so unmistakably her that it can't be anything but her reminding me she's there for me. Your mom will still be there when you need her, she just might not be able to respond in the same ways she used to. \nYou're going to be okay, I promise. It really doesn't feel like it sometimes, but it will be. Even when your whole chest hurts you miss her so badly and you've been crying so long your throat hurts it'll still be okay. \n\nAlso, don't let anyone tell you there's a proper way to grieve. Grieve however you need to as long as you're not getting yourself into trouble. Don't be afraid to go to your brother and your dad because they're experiencing the same thing you are and they'll be able to understand a lot better than you think. Don't be embarrassed to cry or excuse yourself from situations that are a little too much at the moment. Don't be afraid to talk about her! Share those memories that pop up, think about how much you miss her, all those things. Just make sure that you don't let them swallow you, don't wallow and ruin your day with that thought. It's going to take a lot of practice, but that's okay! Don't be afraid to take a day or two off though, if you need it. Balance is good. Sometimes all you can do is get through the day and that's plenty. \n\nAlso x2, anger, shock, denial, depression - it's all normal! Everyone goes through those emotions, they just process at different speeds. \n\nYou got this!!!!! This random 20yo stranger is rooting your family on and sending good vibes and support.\n\nEdit: one more thing. Therapy is very helpful and if anyone tries to rag you for it I'll personally kick they ass",

            "comment": "Oh honey, I am soooo sorry for what youre going through right now! I'm not going to lie...its going to be rough. Each of you might handle it a bit differently. Some bottle up emotions and don't grieve at all. Others get angry. The best thing would be to honor your mother and talk about her. Talk about all the amazing memories you have. It will be sad because you will know you won't have more BUT it will also be happy because you had the memories to begin with. Your dad is probably having a VERY hard time right now. He is grieving the love of his life and most likely trying to keep it together somewhat for you and your brother. Try to be supportive of each other and its ok to cry!! \nAlso when other come asking what they can do...take them up on it! They want to help but don't know what specifically to help with. Let them make a meal that you can easily repeat later or take some of the laundry and bring it back freshly laundered. Youre going to need the help while you take time to grieve and prepare for any memorial services. Go through photos and cherish that your mom was amazing (I can tell just by the way you posted this) and how lucky you were to have her. Then spend each day trying to be the best version of yourself that you can be and make her proud. \nI strongly believe that those who pass watch over us and have had some experiences with it after my grandmother, who was very close to me had passed. I'm guessing you will too. It will come out on nowhere and you will know it is her looking over you. \nAnd if you need anyone to talk to, please dont hesitate to reach out to myself or others on here! I know no one can replace your mom but there are many people on here who you can  count on to be a surrogate mom when you need advice or  to vent.",

Exercise has been a good outlet for me.\n\nI hope you and your family are able to get through this together.",

Celebrate the fact that she got to experience life and its ups and downs :) also, it appears that at least she passed away peacefully. Never think that you didn't do enough for her, because honestly all of us children never think we do, but parents see it as plenty and some. She's resting in eternal paradise, and still looking down at you guys to make sure everything's okay. If you need to talk to anybody, my messages are open. You and your sibling are strong. You'll get through this, but until then, just know we're all here for you \u2764",

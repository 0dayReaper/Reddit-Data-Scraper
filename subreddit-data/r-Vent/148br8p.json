    "postText": "Gotta post here because rant is dark. But yeah pretty much the title. It\u2019s stupid to think you don\u2019t need a government because your little group of antigovernment people still need internal rules. And once you \u201ctake over\u201d you\u2019ll need rules for the civilians. And need money to do things so you need an economic system. And you need consequences, which they definitely are for, but you\u2019ll need some way of enforcing that and organizing everything. And all that will eventually turn into a government. \n\nI think people are just stupid and need a reason to bitch and moan. Just live life and make it good. Blaming problems on the government is essentially like blaming god in my eyes. Yeah they say what to do, but I regularly live life outside the bounds of what is \u201clegal\u201d or \u201cstatus quo\u201d so I don\u2019t understand why others are so fucked all the time. Almost every issue in America is a SOCIAL issue nowadays and that\u2019s not for the government to mandate because as people we should be able to come to our own social understandings.",

The purpose of the government is to serve its populace\u2014but right now it's not doing that effectively. 1% of all people own our wealth and others die cold on the streets. \n\nAn individual protester doesn't gain much attention by himself. So naturally...he bands up with his buddies. That's how every social change in history happened. You could argue that the government shouldn't interfere in social issues, but it does. It interfere's on women's bodily autonomy, it interferes on gay and transgender rights, it interferes on POC rights. Etc. \n\nEvery one of the minority groups I just listed is *several* times as likely to be compromised by our government. And that's not right. I don't blame people for protesting against unfair conditions at all.",

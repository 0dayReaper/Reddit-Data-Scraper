    "postText": "I fucked up so bad, I met the most amazing girl ever, built a connection with her that no one else could, I texted her daily for months, and to top it all off I caught feelings for her. I fucked it all up and now we don\u2019t text anymore. I promised her, told her to believe in me, I told her that I would prove to her that I wasn\u2019t like the other guys that left her but I turned out to be one of those guys that just fucked her over and left her. I want to text her, but I have nothing else to say other than \u201cI\u2019m Sorry\u201d. I can guarantee she\u2019s tired of hearing it. I\u2019m awkward and I get nervous around her. I had a problem with communication when we first started talking and I told her I\u2019d do better and honestly, I thought I was doing good. I thought my communication skills were really improving and getting better but it turns out they weren\u2019t. She told me that she needed me to try harder and if I don\u2019t she can\u2019t talk to me anymore. She told me that almost every time we talk and have an argument she has a mental breakdown and I start them. Hearing that fucking hurt, I never knew that I was so bad for her mental health. I never knew I was hurting her so much. So after months of keeping in touch daily I stopped. I stopped texting her and now it\u2019s been a week. I\u2019ve been beating myself up over this, I\u2019ve isolated myself from friends and doing things with them. I can\u2019t, I\u2019m such a fucked up person. I miss her so much, I want things to get better but I know I\u2019d just be pouring salt into the wound if I texted her now. She\u2019s still hanging out with friends and having fun so as long as she\u2019s okay I\u2019m happy for her. She\u2019s been through so much, endured so much pain. She never deserved this, what I did. I\u2019m sorry. I cried over her like 10 minutes ago. I listened to her voice messages that she sent me and fuck dude, I fucking miss her voice. I miss her, I miss texting her every single day. I fucked that all up, and I cannot stress how sorry I am. I can\u2019t stop thinking about her, it\u2019s been so long since I caught feelings for someone. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m so attached to her. It\u2019s hard for me to let go and forget. She\u2019s such an amazing person, she deserves so much more. I truly am sorry for everything I put her through. I never meant to hurt her the way I did. I\u2019m beating myself up over it. I\u2019m worthless, a fucked up person. I\u2019m sorry, I hope she will forgive me one day.",

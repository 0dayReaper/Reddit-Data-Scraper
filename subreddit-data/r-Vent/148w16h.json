All it does is make me feel like I need to put in effort to _think_, and sure maybe some people like not thinking but I don't. It's like being sucked further out by the tide and you have to keep swimming against or to the side of it just to get back to the shore or stay in control.\n\nI do not like that feeling. I do not like alcohol, so stop fking pestering me to drink \"just one\" or make me feel bad for refusing. Its so fucking annoying. If someone says no, they mean fcking no. If you weren't my family, we wouldn't be friends. All I'm gonna say.",

And even if you aren\u2019t doing it to get drunk, I hate it when people won\u2019t accept myself that all alcohol tastes like crap! Sorry, stop trying to convince me it\u2019s an \u201cacquired taste\u201d.",

I'm 34 now and if I didn't have a social circle that drinks I probably would stop altogether. Don't do anything in life that you're not comfortable doing, and drinking is only special in society because it's the most abused drug.",

The damage it does to relationships, the taste, the price, the unhealthy effects it has on the body- all these reasons and more enforced my prejudice. I still don't plan to drink, but im just now getting to a place where I don't hate people who support the industry. I also used to get pressured to do it. It really sucks",

Like I don\u2019t drink *to* sleep, but some of the best sleep I\u2019ve gotten was after having a strong drink or 2. But everyone\u2019s different and has a different reaction, just like some people like how alcohol tastes and some don\u2019t. Personal preference and all that.",

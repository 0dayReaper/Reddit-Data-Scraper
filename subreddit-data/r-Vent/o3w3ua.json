Depression is whack but I'm so proud of myself for doing so much.\n\nEdit*****\nThe amount of support I have received is way more than I could ever ask for. I just posted to get my excitement out, but I am so grateful for everyone who responded.\n\nI have the first day of my job today and this encouragement and support has only made me more excited to take my life back into my own hands!",

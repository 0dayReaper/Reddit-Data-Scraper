I\u2019ll finally feel good, then my messed up mind will want me to feel bad again. \n\nI don\u2019t really blame it\u2026because I know that good I feel is inly temporary. But boy do I hate it. Its like a hurricane, you know it\u2019s coming and when it comes its pounding away at you, it stays for a while and slowly drifts away leaving you a bit damaged but happy its over\u2026well until the next one comes around.",

But it does get easier\"--- (The Bojack horseman version of Forrest Gump)\n\nMaybe it's the fear of change... maybe the fear of the unknown... maybe it's the fear that our trauma's our personality... \n\nFear has a funny way of manifesting itself... But, true courage doesn't come from heroes/warriors... It comes from people who show up everyday... No matter what the pointless drivel is... It's about finding your meaning in this chaotic world... And finding the strength to keep going...\n\n\"For even legends bleed from regrets...   \nOf which their monuments don't express\" (subject grass... Hahaha)",

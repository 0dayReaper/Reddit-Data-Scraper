    "postText": "Mom, you never told me anything about sex when I was young. You never prepared me for anything. And guess what? I ended up pregnant at 16. So logically I should totally take your advice that I shouldn't have gotten my 13 y/o on birth control or given her condoms. Because that makes total sense. She won't follow my footsteps. She won't be in the situation I was in. She won't have to make the sacrifices I did. Because I'm a decent parent, not an \"idiot\", not someone who \"made a huge mistake\". I'm a parent who knows what teenagers do. I'm a parent who knows that teens need to know and be prepared for some adult situations. I didn't fuck up, YOU DID. I'm not making the same mistakes that you did. So shut the fuck up already.",

So, no, it's not taking the innocence away from a child if you're teaching him/her how bodies work, and should a child be confronted with that situation, she will know what to do or expect.  Innocent can mean that you can be knowledgeable about this, and choose not to engage. But that's my opinion.",

My kids are still young so they don\u2019t need the talk yet, but it\u2019s definitely something I need to start researching and making a plan for. \n\nI was raised in and still live in a pretty traditional Christian community, so while I did get a talk it wasn\u2019t very in depth and was mostly focused on abstinence. I think my parents did a decent job, but I know so many people who clearly weren\u2019t as informed as I was. Girls getting pregnant really young, having kids too close together, families with 10+kids, women almost dying because they believe it\u2019s their calling to have as many kids as possible... \n\nI\u2019ve found the more you tell a kid they can\u2019t do something, the more likely they are to do it. And they\u2019ll probably end up doing it unsafely, and hiding it. To me it makes more sense to make sure they\u2019re informed, safe, and that they know you\u2019ll support them if they need help.",

My daughter is now almost 16 and though it makes her uncomfortable to talk about sex and stuff I explain the big picture stuff (her school had a great Sex Ed program before we moved) \n\nI explained to her that she needs to be careful. My husbands mom had her first child at 16, but didn\u2019t have my husband until 10 years later. I\u2019m adopted and my bio-mom had my sister and I at 18/21. It is common in our family apparently and I don\u2019t want it to happen to her. \n\nShe is not really interested in dating at the moment but I told her before she decides to do anything to come to me. I have clarified with her since she was in 6th/7th grade that if she chooses to do anything with anyone to make sure she wants to do it, don\u2019t let anyone pressure you into anything. If you are sure, I will get condoms and we can go to the doctor for birth control. She just recently expressed interest in maybe taking to her doctor and getting some condoms just in case because some of her friends are already sexually actively. I\u2019m glad she listened and came to me and my husband about it.",

There are parents who raise the teenagers to not do this sort of thing. Giving a teenager some condoms and stuff just lets them do it even more. Sometimes girls still get pregnant and that\u2019s just not something many would like to do in high school or middle school. It adds stress to a person with an already tight and stressful schedule in their days. People like you seem to give up so easily on teaching a teenager not to act that way. A girl in the grade above mine got pregnant and she ended up committing suicide because she was stressed because of school and her life. You seem close minded at the fact that birth control and condoms can still make a girl pregnant.",

People taught not to still do, because at that age the social pressure of others is equal to the pressure from parents. Giving them a method to stay safe and teaching them how is the best way you can go about this. You seem to be in the mindset that teens will listen because someone told them not to, and that's not the case. This is an unavoidable thing, and the only thing you can do is keep them safe. How hard is that to understand?",

They are young adults who have a short time left to learn what they need to know to be functioning adults. That includes condoms, how to jump start a car, how to file taxes, and a ton of other shit that is not taught in schools. \n\nA good parent knows they are responsible for teaching their teens those lessons and providing them the tools they need to succeed in life. You could say it is fucked up to give a teen a tire iron, but they need one if they have a car. Giving them condoms is similar, if they have a sex drive (and most of them will at some point), male or female, they need access to condoms.\n\nYou do not wait to teach a teen to drive before you teach them how to put on their seat belt. You teach them from the time they are infants that in the car, you buckle in. By the time they have their own car, buckling in should be reflexive. \n\nSame thing with birth control and condoms. By the time they are actually having sex, taking care of contraception and disease protection should be reflexive. Waiting until they are \"in a relationship\" is too late. Protection of themselves and their future will be an afterthought at best. \n\nObviously you did not grow up in a family that understands the role a good parent must play in their teens lives and I feel sorry for you. Hope it gets better buddy.",

            "comment": "Recognition and attention feels very strange to me. Sometimes it feels fake/forced from other people when it\u2019s not. I assume it is because I am a very socially anxious person and think everyone is lying to me. I\u2019m also not use to positive attention, so if it\u2019s positive instead of neutral or negative, it feels extra weird and uncomfortable. I\u2019m trying to accept though.",

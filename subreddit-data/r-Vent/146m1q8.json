    "postText": "Over the past year or so I've started to internalize the idea that I am simply cursed, and that I will never experience the things that make me truly happy. The most recent nail in my happiness' coffin came just earlier tonight when I was let go from a job that I really thought I would be able to stay at while I worked towards my dream **in the middle of my 4th shift there**.\n\nIn the past year, I have:\n\n1. Dropped the ball with two separate love interests (and possibly had a third drop the ball with me, still waiting to see how that develops); to be fair one of those really wasn't my fault and the other likely wouldn't have worked out due to separate wants out of a relationship anyway.\n\n2. Been let go from a very comfortable and well-paying job that was in my field and have given up hope of finding another (I'd be happy with any job in my field but I guess that's just too much to ask for)\n\n3. Due to #2, I've had to go **back** into working in food service, which I thought I would be done with once I graduated college (wasn't that the whole point of getting the fucking degree in the first place?)\n\n4. Lost what would have been a relatively well-paying job at a bar I really liked for reasons completely unknown to me, and due to this will likely have to go back into food service for the foreseeable future.\n\n5. Have been stereotyped to my face based on my race, sex, and sexuality shortly after being accused of something I blatantly did not do (I should point out that I was not accused legally, just informally, but it still hurt nonetheless)\n\n6. Been verbally abused and emotionally manipulated by a \"\"\"\"friend\"\"\"\" who would ***scream*** at me for not wanting to have sex with her and then ***refused*** to listen to me when I repeatedly told her that it was in no way her fault or under her control\n\n7. The above occurred because I thought it would be wise to move in with someone I barely knew halfway across the country\n\n8. Got myself nearly $10k in debt getting out of that situation\n\n9. I will have to choose between adding several thousands of dollars to the above debt and not going to my sister's wedding\n\n10. The only close friend I've made in years recently severely and repeatedly violated my trust and privacy, so I'll never be able to trust her again\n\n11. My most recent romantic interest has a quagmire of red flags\n\nAdd on top of all of that the fact that I have **never** been in a healthy relationship, despite the fact that I am extremely emotionally mature and emotionally intelligent, patient beyond belief, never lose my temper or get/stay angry at anyone, am incredibly good at peaceful and productive conflict resolution, and all things considered have great mental health and resilience, this post notwithstanding. People also tell me I'm attractive, intelligent, good at sex, I have a myriad of interesting hobbies and am emotionally and financially independent (though quite poor and without much in the way of spending money or creature comforts); I also don't use substances or have any diseases or severe disabilities. The one thing working against me is that I am very misanthropic and introverted, but you would never guess that based on how I act when I am around people, as I can be very sociable and charming when I want to be. Still, if anything has kept me from getting into a relationship it would likely be how anti-social I am since I usually spend what little free time I have at home with my cats, working on game projects or doing one of my other hobbies.\n\nI am truly starting to internalize that I'm just... Cursed. I know exactly what I want to be happy and yet no matter what I do shit just keeps getting worse for me. Sometimes I think my situation/feelings are normal, and that everyone goes through hard times in their 20s, but other times, it really feels like the universe has it out for me specifically. Not in some grand \"suffer the worst fate imaginable and die a destitute virgin with no family or friends\" kind of way, more like a \"cursed by some evil witch who I slighted once\" way or \"the constant victim of some prankster god\" way or some bullshit. Like whenever God needs a laugh he looks at how he can fuck me over this week. Like next month am I going to come home to one of my cats dead, or find out that I have cancer?\n\nI just don't know how much longer I can tolerate the unending slew of bullshit. All I want is someone to love and a career making video games. Why is even one of those too much to ask for?",

    "postText": "It's kinda hard to articulate, but for over a year now, I feel so emotionally disconnected from people, and it's been a major contributor to my depression. I remember when it started just after I graduated and moved to a new state at some point I got this realization of \"No one will care about me beyond a surface level other then myself and why should they\". Now all of a sudden there's this invisible wall when your talking to people, this undefinable distance.\n \n   I find myself keeping friends in categories like (party friends, close friends, casual friends) I am by no means alone but I feel alone with them. Dont get me wrong i care about everyone i meet I just...idk. Sometimes in the momment when I'm out of my head I'm grounded and I feel that taste of connection but it's so temporary in the most fleeting way possible. It's sad I'm sad but I could never tell people how I really feel that would put my job and my reputation at risk as \"your friendly neighborhood host\". People would be disappointed in me if said \"hey all the care I put into our relationships or effort I put into friendly interactions makes me feel more alone than if I was glued to the couch on a Friday night\ud83d\ude43\".",

This is an aspect of grief that doesn't get talked about much: how to deal with painful surprises. \n\nOnce the initial jolt of hurt and betrayal wears off, consider checking out The Grief Recovery Handbook (Russell and Friedman).

(I'll warn you, though - just because it's straightforward doesn't mean that it's easy. It's not. It will make you be uncomfortably honest with yourself. It will make you remember things you thought you'd forgotten. But it will also help you heal.) \n\nIf it's worth anything to you, I empathize. I know full well that sometimes grief is complicated by things we learn after a death. I know the heartbreak, too, of a death following a broken relationship, and the complicated mix of emotions. I'm familiar with the guilt, the anger, all of it. \n\nI truly hope you can heal. If you ever want to chat with someone who's been there, I'm here.",

Tell them you \"found evidence that he found my disability amusing and resented my existence\". \n\nI totally sympathise with your confusion. But don't think you have to *feel* a certain way.\nJust let the emotions come whatever they are....

You are missing the father you thought he was and you are finding out about the person who he was behind his father persona. This is really complicated because its like two people died. \n\nMy only, ironic, advice is that people around you will tell you all sorts of stuff you should or shouldn't be feeling. \"Well I mean he still is was your dad!\" and \"well why are you sad about it then?\" Fuck them.

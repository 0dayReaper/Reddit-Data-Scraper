    "postText": "I work for an insanely overpriced/overhyped soap store where they force us to be aggressively friendly. We only get paid twice a month. I was moved to full time not too long ago, which came with health benefits. That would\u2019ve been great, but for the first month of being \u201ccovered\u201d, I wasn\u2019t in the carrier system, so to see any doctor or receive any treatment, I would\u2019ve had to pay out of pocket. This job even full time doesn\u2019t pay me enough to wait over a month to be reimbursed over $300 from a carrier and I\u2019m not even in the system yet. \n\nI wasn\u2019t able to see my doctor for over a month. They decided to tell me ON pay day they would be taking and extra $100 out of my check for being in \u201carrears\u201d on my insurance policy n top of what I have to pay this month and will be doing the same with my next one. My check was like $560 for having worked almost 80 hours that pay period. After paying what bills I could and getting what I hope is enough gas to last until at least next week, I have $20 left. I\u2019m exhausted and broken and I hate this ethically hypocritical company so much it burns. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or who to call but for the next month and a half I will be in such a financial position that I may as well not even have a job. I quite literally will have to choose between paying bills or eating. I hate it here and I\u2019m so close to breaking down. I\u2019m overwhelmed, overworked, and VICIOUSLY underpaid and undervalued. I hope an orca sinks the company founder\u2019s boat.",

    "postText": "I hate my child. \n\nMy husband and I did everything \u201cright\u201d. We went to school. We started careers, we got married and bought a house. We have a savings account and we made sure we were emotionally, financially and mentally ready for a child. \n\nThroughout my pregnancy I consumed no caffeine, very little sugar, obviously no drugs or alcohol. I was completely healthy, 26, and had a picture perfect pregnancy. My husband was supportive, involved and loving throughout the entire pregnancy.  Then we had a healthy baby boy. \n\nHe never smiled. Never made eye contact. Never babbled. We recognized signs of delay and got immediate early intervention. Our son has had services since the age of 7 months. I have advocated for him tirelessly, as has my husband. We sold our house and moved closer to a better special needs school. We are all in therapy and support groups. We are doing everything \u201cright\u201d. \n\nMy son is nonverbal. He is not toilet trained. He can feed himself dried cereal and fruits only. Getting him to drink anything let alone water is almost impossible. We have to give him IV hydration multiple times a month. He is 11 now and large and strong. He has punched me several times, he has knocked my husbands tooth out, he has damaged my shoulder to the point that my right arm no longer raises past my head. He screams at random moments so loudly that my ears ring. We have to lock him in a sleep safe bed otherwise he will cause absolute havoc. He has started fires, touches himself in public, shoves all caretakers into walls and doors and humps them. \n\nWe have no friends. Family will not visit us and we are no longer invited to anything. We can\u2019t FaceTime into events since it triggers a meltdown. My house is a war zone, and my husband and I are scared of our increasingly strong son. \n\nWe cannot have pets. We had to rehome our cat when he tried to throw her at the age of 3. \n\nMy husband and I have not been on a date in six years.  We wanted more children and that\u2019s impossible with our current life. \n\nI hate him. I fear him. He has ruined my life. He has taken everything from my husband and I and I wish I would die in my sleep rather than deal with him one more moment. My husband is equally burnt out and miserable. \n\nWe have had enough. We are in the process of finding a residential home for him. We will pay until he is 18 and then we are done. If we cannot find a residential place for him soon, I am taking him to the police station and signing over my rights. My husband is as well. We will not try for another child, I can\u2019t risk having another one like him. \n\nI hate him. I hate his blank stare and his strong hands. I hate slipping on his half dried jizz in random parts of the house. I want to forget he exists. I want to rejoin the world. Covid was hell for us, no school no services just us trying to survive. \n\nI wish I had aborted him. I wish I had never met the love of my life and had a child with him. I wish I was dead. \n\nI refuse to parent a broken child anymore. He is a blank shell of a person and he feels nothing for any of us.\n\n\n\nUpdate/reply: Needless to say my husband and I are overwhelmed by all this. Thank you for the kindness and compassion you\u2019ve shown. \n\nI am a frequent Reddit reader, but have never posted before. I posted in a moment of anger and frustration and desperation and I\u2019m so glad I did. I don\u2019t hate my son, not really. But I can\u2019t live with him much longer, and neither can my husband. He will only get bigger and stronger, and my husband is especially afraid of hurting him trying to defend himself/me or even stop my son from self harming. His blood pressure is through the roof. \n\nWe have found two residential programs with separate facilities for children and adults, where he can spend the rest of his days. One is a six hour drive, one is a six hour flight. We haven\u2019t flown with him since he was four and frankly I will not do that to us, the other passengers and most importantly to him. \n\nA few frequent questions answered because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to get to everyone and I\u2019m heading to bed:\n\nHis diagnosis: he has severe autism. He is nonverbal and not toilet trained. He\u2019s not the autistic that does puzzles and is amazing at math and has special interests and some sensory issues (not to belittle anyone who is going through that or has someone going through it. I see you and you\u2019re a valid person). He is completely nonfunctional to put it plainly. He has profound mental retardation, occupational defiance disorder, and will not get better. We have been to specialists all over the country and live in an area and have access to incredible care, we have had his brain studied. Usually parts of the brain will show signs of activity when stimulated by an outside source. My husband and I, pictures of cute dogs, favorite toys and food. \n\nHis brain doesn\u2019t work like that. He loves me no more or less than he loves anything, which is not at all. \n\nIt\u2019s a hard pill to swallow for sure, but it is reality. \n\nAdoption: we will not be trying for another child. Frankly, we are terrified this will happen again, as unlikely as that is. I would spend my entire pregnancy scared and I am tired of being scared. We would like to adopt, but residential care even with insurance is expensive and we would not be able to feel like we could properly provide for more than the child we have now. It\u2019s a ongoing discussion and not one we will solve anytime soon. We have a lot of healing and work ahead of us to just be people again. \n\nI also want to acknowledge something: we are upper middle class professionals living in a very developed, wealthy area. We have access to services, doctors, insurance, a home, schools and professionals that many do not. We are educated and have enough time to advocate for ourselves and our son. Many special need caregivers do not have any of this. My heart breaks for them and my messages are open. That we can put our child in a facility is a privilege that shouldn\u2019t be a privilege. That we can basically give him away and know he\u2019s safe is a reality that many don\u2019t face.",

The kid I meant couldn't do anything, no talk, no eat, no moving of any sort.  What kind of life is that for that child and his parents.  It seemed they cared for a body, not a human. \nI'm so sorry, I hope all works out.",

When Karen got older, and stronger, she started being physically abusive to everybody. She was also non verbal. My aunt signed her over to the state. Word is that she passed away a few years back. My aunt didn't go see her all of those years, I guess she didn't see the point. By no means does this mean my aunt is a bad person or a bad mother. In fact, she's one of thr best I know. She would do anything for anyone. She just couldn't handle that. She was ill equipped. She did the right thing. \n\nI hope you find peace after you get him into a facility where he and others will be supervised and safe. I hope you get to live the life you feel you lost out on.

In 7 years he will be an adult, animal abusing, sexually assaulting, arsonist in diapers.

My best friend\u2019s sister has a son with issues similar to yours, but not quite as severe. When he got into his teens and she could no longer contain his violence and he became a real threat to her, her husband, and her 2 younger children, she hit a breaking point and placed him with a special care home. He\u2019s been there for a couple years now and it seems like everyone, including the son in the special care home is happier and better for it. The staff at the facility are better equipped to deal with his outbursts and have been able to teach him some methods for emotional self-regulation. He expresses no sadness about being away from his family and has improved in ways previously unimaginable like playing board games with the other kids at the home. I wish you all the best and hope you will be able to find some peace soon.",

My family did full time care for a non verbal girl who was 13 with a mental age of about 3 for several years. My mother also worked at a daycare where i would come to help her with the disabled children after school. I know from experience that even caring for children on the low end of the scale can be harrowing sometimes, i cant imagine what your going through. I think about the kids i cared for often and they always remind me every single day of the many reasons why i will never have children. Some people simply don't have the capacity to love through that. I will remember your story always and i hope it brings some comfort to know that you inspire me to never create life without reason. \n\nI've learned through other experiences with my life that the social expectations to love your family \"no matter what\", and to keep your \"blood\" in your life always, are antiquated and narrow minded. I think it is noble that you will be paying for him to find a good home, but you truly are not obligated to do even that. Please don't feel that you are a bad person for doing this, and as bad as it sounds, i think you understand when i say that I hope you can enjoy your lives as if you never had him. You cant get that time back but there's truly nothing wrong with moving forward as if your back at square 1.\n\nI wish you the best of luck and I know ill think about your story often. I hope that you find some sort of peace, whatever shape that may take.",

I wish you and your husband the best of luck and I hope that u can get some rest bite. Again I am so sorry",

Probably one of my worst opinions. But if they can't get better and their life will always be full of anger and pain whats the point. \n\nI apologize for my dark thoughts. Either way, even if he's not capable of appreciating your efforts, I appreciate them, I have a former relative with two severely autistic daughters, the daughters are in their 20s-30s but have the minds of toddlers, the mother is horrible. She has never put in the work to even try to care for her daughters, all she wants to do is party. She has caused her young son so many cavities from never making him brush his teeth and only feeding him candy and unhealthy stuff, thankfully the father has custody of the son, he's a great father and the son is now taken very good care of. My point is I'm glad you've actually put in the effort. And I think signing away your rights sounds like the best idea. You also have to take care of yourself and it sounds like this situation is weighing on you terribly",

When I read the headline I had a totally different opinion than when after I read your whole post. \n\nI wish more people wouldn't shame parents with special needs children as not being pros at handling our own children. I'm sure you've gotten the \"You're the parent\" speech many times you could just strangle the next person who says it. It's hard just to be a parent and know what to do with a normal child. Mine was diagnosed with Global Developmental Delay, which a blanket term used when the doc don't know wtf is actually wrong and the child is high functioning enough you wouldn't know what's wrong until you've interacted with them in an activity involving coordination, logic and dexterity. \n\nYour son's delay sounds much more severe than GDD. I don't blame you for wanting to hand him over to people who are more experienced with taking care of mentally disabled kids. Despite \"hating\" your kid I know deep down it's tearing you up to think and you're afraid of being seen as a failure. You are not a failure. You tried. You went at it past your limit of parental ability. You are only human.",

I never understood why and felt so bad for these kids. I saw them for 6 hours each day and felt so blessed to be working with them. I thought it was amazing to see the different syndromes and minds working in action. How music would stimulate some or how others would enjoy touching different fabrics and stuff. At times I thought these parents must take \"the easy way out\". \n\nBut it's not! It's not \"easy\". It's not a decision  made in a hurry and it's not just a few hours every day.\n\nReading your words makes me realize why places like  the one I worked at exist and are an absolute necessity. Even if I felt that spending time with these children felt like the best time in the world, I never had to face a 24/7 period with these challenges, especially in your own home. Your own family.\n\nI feel for you! And I hear you! You are doing the right thing, you sound like you've always done the right thing and I commend you for that! \n\nI send you so much love! May you find the happiness that you deserve! \n\nThank you for sharing this!",

He is still very violent and stands at 6\u20195 and if I had to guess, around 400 or more pounds. He has put his mom in the hospital multiple times and she had a mental breakdown where she actually lit herself on fire in a suicide attempt. They all have mental health issues from years of abuse from their son. I have personally experienced the abuse and witnessed it as well. Their house went into foreclosure because he destroyed it-and they couldn\u2019t have caregivers for long either so it fell on the mom. They finally got him into a residential program again, but they never seem to last because he will just get kicked out for being too violent. They went from rich to living in poverty with severe mental and physical health issues. It sucks. There just doesn\u2019t seem to be any answers on what the \u201cright\u201d thing to do is. You don\u2019t want to abandon your own child, but your health in every aspect also cannot live in a dangerous/toxic environment. \n\nI think you and your husband need to do what is best for the both of you at this point. Try to move on and get back to living/enjoying life. The situation sucks, but I can assure you from watching my friends brother that this will only get worse. :/ \n\nIt takes actual angels on earth to work in homes with violent kids with autism.

An experience like this can easily wreck a marriage for many, I\u2019m glad you two are still holding up.

Honestly words can't describe the amount I sympathize for u truly. \n\nI am a caregiver for 2 men in their twenties (brothers) with severe autism, mental retardation (don't care that it isn't politically correct to say that. It's the truth), and mental illness. One is not as bad as your son but still pretty dysfunctional. He has a huge scar wear he split his skull open last year from head banging, screams for hours on end, and digs his shiny out of his asshole. Things like that. I don't think he cares about any of us at all. Not really. His parents deep down maybe. Sort of. Actually. Questionable. Plus. We have to try to maintain his physical comfort, mood and pain and to do so give tons of meds which are killing his liver. Plus we are using cannabis in high doses to try to help ( questionable too I know, but it is legal and prescribed here in CA). Sometimes I wonder if he would be better off just falling asleep and never waking. I know that sounds awful, but when you witness that existence in a daily, you will see it is an existence no one should live with. They also have extremely  wealthy and educated parents and we live in a great part of CA with amazing professionals, Drs. And resources. The parents are lucky to be able to afford myself and other caregivers extra out of pocket for constant care. Anyways. I am so sorry and so happy you have found a home for him. Best of luck to you and your family",

I am a nurse and I know the type that your son is. \n\nWe get them in the ER sometimes when they\u2019re out of control at the group home, police get called and the home cannot handle them anymore. Sometimes they stay with us for a few hours for emergency meds and go back. Other times they are transitioned to a different level of outpatient care. \n\nI have seen these 14, 16, 18, 20 year old\u2019s break trained staff\u2019s bones, hijack cars and injure other kids and innocent third parties. And all of this in a specialty care setting. Not at home. \n\nFor me personally, these are some of the scariest patients I deal with. And I see a lot working in the ED. They are scary and it\u2019s mainly because they are SO unpredictable. Each action is based only on their wants/random desires at that moment. I know the blank look you speak of. And it\u2019s terrifying. \n\nA lot of these that end up in the ER, eventually end up placed in locked down care facilities that specialize in these cases. \n\nThat is the help that your child needs. It sounds like you did everything that you could, and researched his condition and had him evaluated very thoroughly. Which is more than most do. \n\nIt is important for y\u2019all to remember that he cannot feel emotions the way we do. He doesn\u2019t love you. He doesn\u2019t love your husband. He will not feel abandoned by you. You should not feel guilty about this. You should not feel like you are abandoning him. \n\nI want you to further understand that there is NOTHING wrong with what you are doing and it will likely be what is best for him and will DEFINITELY be what is best for you and your husband in the long run. I\u2019m honestly surprised y\u2019all have made it this long. \n\nLike I said, as a nurse I see the people that these severe ASD/ODD kids injure\u2026I see them and treat them too. And I hear about the ones that don\u2019t make it into the hospital, because their kid accidentally killed them. I don\u2019t want you or your husband to be one of those parents; in the ER or dead. \n\nMake the decision to move on and get your life back. No one can judge you. And those that try to are ignorant to your situation. Your efforts to attempt to give him a normal life were noble, and far more than other kids get, but it\u2019s time\u2026\n\nAnd if you hear nothing else. I want you to know, it\u2019s okay.",

Truly. \n\nThis has forever altered my perspective on life. And further allows me to hold more space and awareness of/for this sorrowful reality. \n\nI am SO sorry. I personally, just want to reach out and hug and hold you. I hope you continue to find and feel love, hope, faith and restoration from your courageous act of sharing \u2026 AND living through this. \ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d\n\nBeing but a tiny witnessed, in just a blip of time, to your story, will be etched my heart forever.

HUMANITY.\n\n//\n\nI have love for you. I deeply see you. I hold you. I pray for you.\n\nBE well.\n\n//\n\n( Lastly, your post randomly populated on my main page tonight. I\u2019m rarely on Reddit but did succumb to some pushed notification/clock-bait on Real Housewives at 4am. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nThis, after I was awoken by a vibrating phone since I didn\u2019t put it on night mode \u2014 a RARE occurrence\u2026 And then, of course, my I caught a glimpse of the notifications that snuck through and hopped-on. Grateful I did. \u2026 ALSO \u2014 THIS. this REAL. LIFE. life \u2014 makes me feel even more like \u201cHousewives\u201d is such a type of \u201cHunger Games\u201d elitist, unnecessary, out-of-touch, vapid concept\u2026 A continued welcome and necessary perspective in my life.\n\nAlas, I cannot even recall my original reason for joining \u201cVent\u201d \u2026 likely something about marriage \u2014 mine has been excruciating at times in recent years and yet, your sharing puts a different lens on emotional pain. \n\nThank you for this lens.\n\n\ud83c\udff3\n\nMy intent is not to be a voyeur, but to share, earnestly, that your pain is not for not.\n\nIt has and will help people. It has immensely help me and we will continue to grow in my heart.\n\nAmongst the thorns on the vine (of your life), I can see and feel there are also rose buds \u2026 growing, eager to wake-up and wrap you in warmth and comfort and happiness. I can\u2019t wait for you to experience relief and roses throughout every your life.\n\nSweet blessings upon you. MANY a sweet and multiplied blessing. )\n\n\ud83e\udd0d\n\ud83d\udc97",

I'm aware you and your husband are upper class professionals that have access to everything, which many special needs caregivers do not. Unfortunately, your son's brain is unique.\n\nMy mother's cousin was adopted, and he has his own 3 children. The youngest son has some issues like that. Violent. He might has severe levels of intellectual disabilities, and I think he's sorta nonverbal. He'd punch his brothers etc. They eventually got him on some medication to calm him down, so he wasn't violent anymore! He was able to stay at home.\n\nI'm wondering if you did try some medication to calm him down? I know you said you took him to many specialists and put him in therapy, but you hadn't mentioned medication. I REALLY hope that the medication will work on your son so he'll stop being violent. Again, I'm very sorry to hear about the situatuon that you had to live in.",

But I still don\u2019t believe he is as bad as your son.\n\nI am just a stranger on the internet, but in a more savage life, children like that would be left in the forest to be dealt with by nature. Children in a good scenario grow up to be independent and parents eventually get their freedom back. Your life is miserable, I understand why you hate him. \n\nMOST humans are capable of raising a healthy, or even slightly disabled child, very few humans are able to deal with a violent child that will need care for the rest of their life. It\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s not his fault. It\u2019s just the dark side of nature and just a sticky situation for everyone. I mean if something happened to him it would be abuse on your part, yet I am sure you feel abused everyday.\n\n\nGood luck to you, and thank you for getting this off of your chest.",

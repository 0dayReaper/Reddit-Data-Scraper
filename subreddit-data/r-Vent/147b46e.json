    "postText": "For this to make sense: \nI'm a chronily I'll minor living with my parents, sibling (21), and dog. It will be a couple years before I can live on my own.\n\nThey have always fought. Nothing more than yelling and manipulation. She's going to ask my dad for a divorce on Tuesday (Sunday right now) during their first session of couples therapy. I'm mad. They booked an appointment with a couples therapist saying that they were going to try and make it work for us. She decided she was done with his shit. I don't blame her, I'm happy she is going to stand up for herself and ask. But I'm still angry at her. I guess I'm mostly angry she told us so soon (us being me and my sibling). She told us on Friday. Now everytime they interact I can't help but think about it.\n\nWhat if he doesn't take it well? What if he hits her? He's never hit her before but he did punch the wall instead once. I'm scared. I don't want this. I know it's probably best but I just hate it so much. What's going to happen with our housing? Neither can afford to live off their income alone. I don't know how they'll pay for my medical bills. I'm finally going to go back to in person school next year, I have a school I really want to go to. If we move I probably wouldn't be able to go anymore. I feel like such a burden. My sibling can't drive, they don't have a job, and theirs no way I could just be with them. I don't want to choose a parent to be with. I don't want to deal with this. I shouldn't have to deal with it.\n\n I'm scared and anxious. I'm biting my lips again. I just got out of a really dark place, I'm finally doing better, I don't think I can handle this right now. One second I'm sobbing then the next I'm happy again. I'm all over the place. I don't know what to do. My dad's not okay. I know he isn't. What if he does something stupid? I can't do this. I'm so scared. I don't know what to do. I just want it all to stop.",

            "comment": "just try your best to get through this, it\u2019s all you can do. Help your mom, maybe. Advocate for her and yourself. But most of all, remember that you aren\u2019t a burden. people choose to keep you around, especially your parents. They know what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s okay to feel sad, and mood swings are also normal. Try to find things that make you happy. if there are none, imagine something that would make you happy, and try to make it happen. If your dad does something, keep a &gt;!weapon!&lt; near you at all times, preferably on you. Claim self defense if you have to. Protect people you love, and protect yourself in danger. If you need to talk more, my messages are open if you want to. I think you are very brave for asking for help and telling people about what is happening.",

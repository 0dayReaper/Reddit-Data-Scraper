    "postText": "I\u2019ve been a carer for 3 months. I meet a range of patients.,some are young but disabled. Some are old, needing hoists or aids to help them move.. some are non verbal. And some, are neglected by heir families. Children who don\u2019t bother to buy their mothers new clothes because she\u2019ll \u2018die soon\u2019 or won\u2019t come to visit her or help her when she\u2019s fallen. So I wait, patiently, for four hours til the ambulance arrives.. comforting her and explaining that her daughter is caught up with important duties, although reality is.. she\u2019s at a party and can\u2019t be bothered to help. So I sit here on the floor, giving her cups of tea, reading magazines because I\u2019m legally not allowed to lift her up. \n\nI visit people who can\u2019t feed themselves, whose only real joy in life is when I scratch his back during manoeuvres. \u2018LOVELY\u2019 he says. I can\u2019t believe a back scratch means so much. yet, he has a happier life. Gets to see his farm from the window. He watches telly and sleeps often. He hates rabbits. He tells me all the time. We watch holby city on the weekend together. I hope it means something to him. \n\nI meet couples who have to sell their beloved vintage car, because they can\u2019t afford the care companies. It crushes me. One blind, the other had dementia. They are some of the kindest people I meet. I make them lunch of fish with broccoli and green beans, I give one orange juice, the other one white wine, I hope their meal is perfect. They deserve the best life. Even if I\u2019m a fairly shit cook.. they are too polite to whine. The lady cried one time, her dementia.. she couldn\u2019t find the seat right in front of her. She found it in the end but cried. I gave her tissues and rubbed her back. \u2018We all have bad days!\u2019 I told her. \n\nI meet a lady, 93! Super fast on her feet. Like a whippet! I do simple care for her, mostly because she doesn\u2019t want to go to the bathroom with the help of her husband. 93.. and still modest? I visit her multiple times a day. Her husband is a saint. \n\nOne of my patients has the best smile. According to her record, should of died at the beginning of covid. She\u2019s been in the fetal position for 2 years now. We do what we can. Clean her up down below, strip wash, brush her hair, apply lip gloss.. she loves her husband.. she whispers \u2018 where\u2019s XXX?\u2019 We tell her he\u2019s back in just a second.. he sleeps next to her on a camp bed every night. I\u2019ve never seen such dedication. \n\n\nThis has all been eye opening. The world of care is a scary one. Thank you for taking the time to read my view.",

            "comment": "Fuck. I was already feeling bleak and hopeless today. Thinking about mortality and being alone and forgotten as I basically wait to die feels even worse. I'm seriously disabled and who knows I may have to have care like that too before I'm very old. I don't have anybody in my life in terms of friends, and Im 38 so making new ones is very hard. The future looks really discouraging.",

She didn\u2019t want to eat. Walk. Talk. Just watch her favorite shows on tv. I\u2019m an only child and now an orphan. I\u2019m 56 she was 81. She was my rock and my best friend. No one really understands how hard it is for me to function with her gone. It\u2019s been 2 years.",

I'm 17 and just made a post about intrusive thoughts and responses to them (OCD) cause I was in a state of high anxiety. They wrote to assure me it's okay but then said they think I'll feel better once they tell me something. They wrote they do that with their freaking kids. Apparently it's all consensual and it wasn't actual actual that, and everything and I pray it was fake. But it was so convincing, that I just hope (even though incest is still so wrong) that the teenage daughters are at least adults. I was stumped. I never expected that sort of message from an online stranger. And I feel like crap for not reporting them but I was mentally shaken.",

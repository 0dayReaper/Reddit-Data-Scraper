    "postText": "First off, that doesn't make any sense because I'm in no position of leadership, plus, I'm the junior most member of the team (I've worked with them casually before... But I'm a regular now).\n\nThey've asked me so because, I pointed out a few things/practices that could've been fixed... And those were the things they got commended for during a surprise inspection.\n\nSo, what's my go to response? Sulk... And then try to implicate myself in a workplace accident to make me seem irresponsible...\n\nBut, no one was around when the \"accident\" happened (nearly got squished... Twas the plan)... But, they figured I must've broken a record for fastest run at a specific work drill... \n\nNow they're contemplating making me the assistant to the team leader... Gaaah",

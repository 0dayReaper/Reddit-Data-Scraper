    "postText": "I'm 17. I'm so fucking done. With everything. I'm done with my abusive fucking parents, I'm done with my deteriorating body and being trans. I'm fucking sick of being dead named and having to wake up every day and ignore all my bodily needs for the sake of shitty grades. I'm sick of having disabilities. I could've just downed that whole can of monster. I just wanted to get it over with. Ive been here so many fucking times I can't count anymore. It took me everything. The only reason I'm still alive is because of my cat. I seriously almost fucking killed myself and it feels like I'm processing all of it now. I have 2 hours of sleep left and I feel defeated. I'm fucking pathetic.",

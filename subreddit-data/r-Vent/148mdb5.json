    "postText": "i am stuck in a house full of people who hate me. my friends left because i moved, which obviously is fair. but still. i am so fucking lonely and scared and no one cares. i feel like by being upset i\u2019m pushing people away and in turn is going to make them leave faster, even if i know they already don\u2019t like me. i want to get out of this house but i\u2019m guilted and shamed for that and i don\u2019t know what im doing and im so alone in all of this. i just wish people cared. i wish anyone cared at all. i wish every time i was upset i didn\u2019t fuck something up. i\u2019m so scared of being alone and it\u2019s already happened. i already am.",

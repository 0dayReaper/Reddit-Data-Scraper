    "postText": "Okay so i knew this boy in middle school and he was my crush we will call him \u201cJohn\u201d.  Now John and i never spoke or had a class together but i knew of him and it wasn\u2019t a big crush but he just seemed like a type of person i wanted to be friends with. I ended up having trouble with school and transferred to another one and it was online. This year it wasn\u2019t online, and the first day of school i see him.  He said he didn\u2019t know who i was and that he would\u2019ve recognized me. Now my school all kids there are troubled or have problems (mental health problems learning disabilities). Fast forward into the year i like John again because of him being the only one that was to talk to me in school.  One time i was having a panic attack at school and he saw me crying he talked to me and it cheered me up. For some reason i think that made me like him even more, i have been convincing myself (my friends have convinced me too) that he likes me back. But i have bad anxiety so i never asked if he wanted to hangout,  i was also always scared to start conversations but i tried to make it clear that i did have an interest in being his friend by smiling whenever i see him or saying \u201chi\u201d.  There are tons of reasons why i thought he liked me back but i doubted it because i am very insecure and he is friendly to everybody at my school.  I still think a bit that he likes me. I haven\u2019t been able to get him off my mind after that first day of school.  But here\u2019s the worse part. I started dating someone online let\u2019s call him \u201cBen\u201d.  Now i love Ben, i have been with him for a while now (the crush on John started before me and Ben started dating) But me and him have different beliefs. i cant go into much detail but we disagree about a lot of things. And to be with him long term i have to like change who i want to be and i don\u2019t know if i\u2019m okay with that.  We argue a lot too, for example we fought about goth people. Like that is literally so dumb. But i don\u2019t know what to do. i feel horrible for wanting to potentially be with someone else i just feel like i need to do what would make me happier. Does anybody have any suggestions?",

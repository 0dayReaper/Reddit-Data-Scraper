    "postText": "And he didn't want any. I know it seems so miniscule, but I really woke up and tried to kick my ass out of bed and make pancakes to make the day a bit better for him. \n\nI kept messing up my first attempt so I ate all the bad ones, but I ended up with one good pancake and set that aside for him. And he told me he didn't want any. I felt bad but respected his decision. \n\nThe next day he starts making fun at my expense and saying how crap it looked and how he couldn't be bothered to eat any and that he was happier eating his toast. I honestly felt really crushed, I didn't find this funny because I really tried my best... \n\nHe started going on and on about how I need classes now that I'm 20 on being a \"parent\" and cooking 2 meals a day and I don't know how that ties to this... I don't even have kids nor plan to just yet",

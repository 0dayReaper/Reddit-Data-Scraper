            "comment": "I am sorry to go religious on you.\n\n\"Verily, with every difficulty there is a relief\u201d 94:6. Let your wailing not cancel your reward. Were you to witness the reward of your misfortune, you would have come to know that it is smaller than the greatness of the reward which God has promised for the people who submit to his will and bear misfortune with patience.\n\nwailing doesn't apply to you. It's the rest of the verse i wanna show you.\n\nTL;DR difficulty &lt; reward, skip the will part. God is said to someone who is 60 more time loving than ur mother. So the only thing u need is patience. ik, the world is chaos. I get ur doubt.\n\nMoving on,\n\nik this verse doesn't encompasses your situation. It's closest thing i have in my notes.\n\nStay Strong and be patient, that's all i'm tryna say.\n\nYou are gonna be a terrific mother. Alsom Even though he is not a good dad rn, i hope he can change. Your father sounds like he would be wonderful grandpa btw.\n\nYou have been strong for so long. I'm proud of you.\n\nAbout ur friends,\n\nI am sorry that your friends are flaking, everyone is going through thier own shit ig. Sometime i ignore people because i am not able to support them and felt like they gonna ask me something i can't offer.\n\nInstead of worrying about that,\n\nIt's better to sleep with ur hopes up thinking that everything will workout rather than have a sleepless night by worrying.\n\nWorrying is the worst thing, it doesnt help you. You should analyze ur situation and find paths you can take to better ur situation. But, Go ahead in life with ur chin up and a big smile.\n\nIt's gonna sound shitty but u can't be happy always. So would u go on in life being sad most of the time. No, u find positivity in everything.\n\nAbout ur husband gf, she doesnt know you. Her obvious instinct is to hate you. Alot of times, we judge someone already and have hate in our hearts before we give them the chance. It's not you. It's just how it works.\n\nYou dont know what's in your card in the future. Maybe in the future u would have a loving family and friends and u live happily ever after. It's just a different phase rn.\n\nSomething about storms, is that they pass.\n\nSo have faith in you, everything will workout. \n\nI wish your family a long and happy life.",

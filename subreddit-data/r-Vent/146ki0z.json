I feel like all I do is fail them and make them embarrassed. I know they love me, so much. But I can\u2019t make myself believe any of it. I haven\u2019t had a job in over a year, and I am a mess I can\u2019t do anything without them telling me too and im an asshole to them and im not even trying to be.\n\nI can\u2019t believe myself. I am a disappointment and I\u2019m not happy. All I ever wanted to do is make my parents happy and provide for them. I don\u2019t realize if im being rude, and ive tried working on it and its so hard for me\n\nI try my best but i keep failing.\n\nI feel like such a waste of a human and a big disgrace and disappointment to my parents. I know they love me, but im a terrible son.",

You are not alone\n\nDo you know what you enjoy, or what you wanna do? Do you have the feeling that you weren\u2019t ready to graduate just yet? I would talk about this with your parents",

I just got my classes and everything set up for college, and I hopefully will be accepted into a good paying part time job in the next coming days.\n\nI know people struggle as well, but I feel different almost. I feel as if everyone is going to these big colleges with 4.0 gpa straight As and I wasn\u2019t that at all. I was a barely below average gpa and around Bs and Cs in school and never really tested well\n\nI rely on my parents currently for gas and things like that since I never really go out, I get my enjoyment by hanging out with them. But, it\u2019s just the way I treat them and the things I do is what make me feels the way I do, I feel completely lost knowing im most likely being just a big thing to deal with and im not helping out in anyway, in fact just making it worse. \n\nI wanna provide. I wanna be better. I just idk I can\u2019t",

They\u2019ve talked to me about it a few times and I\u2019ve fixed it for awhile but it just comes back. I feel terrible and i feel so much guilt that im causing them sadness. \n\nEspecially after making my dad cry. I feel so unbelievably guilty and terrible and like a horrible son. I cannot believe I made that happen. All because of me. I just wish I could be better I wish I wasn\u2019t such a bad person",

It wasn\u2019t even that big of a deal. It\u2019s just the fact he came to me and started crying explaining he wanted everything for me, he wanted the best for me which is why I feel so guilty.

Expecting to have your whole life together by eighteen years old isn't very realistic, and your parents need to realize that, if they're the ones expecting that out of you. In this day and age, it's not very doable. Times were different when your parents turned eighteen. \n\nI feel the struggle. I struggled to find a job right out of high school too, and I graduated in 2015. It took me almost two years to actually get hired at a place I applied to. I applied to so many places and got rejected that many times. It's very frustrating, and I totally get feeling defeated.",

That\u2019s 100% where a successful 18-year-old should be.\n\nEnjoy your summer. Do you have friends, sports, hobbies you can participate in?\n\nYou can\u2019t be the success you want by focusing only on the professional you, the personal and social you also needs to be nurtured.\n\nIf you want to serve your parents, learn to cook and cook meals for your family? Do chores? Build a garden? \n\nYou\u2019re putting so much pressure on yourself.\n\nBe you. You\u2019re totally a great person.\n\nI\u2019ve raised 3 children who are now in their 30s. Believe me, GPA and superhero academic achievements might help initially, but in terms of happiness and mental health and relationships they really don\u2019t my mean much.\n\nHonour your parents by relaxing and enjoying your life.",

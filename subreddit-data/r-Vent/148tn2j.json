I feel like I've been making sacrifices to make sure I'm in a good place financially while he's just been fucking us.  Our whole life is on hold now, I don't want to get married, can't buy a house, cant afford to go on vacation.  We're both successful professionals, but we have to live like were back in college if we have any chance of paying it off. Oh!...and he's mad that I'm mad \ud83d\ude44",

Every woman I've ever gone on a date with I've let know pretty early on.\n\nI mean yeah it's not a first date conversation, \"by the way I got all this debt\"\n\nBut it definitely comes out far far far far before the idea of marriage even becomes a whisper of a thought in either of our heads.\n\nLike my current person, I'm actually seeing male right now. Crazy how life works.\n\nBut anyways I let him know like 3 weeks into it that I'm broke and in debt. Before things got slightly serious. He's cool with it but he had that cushion to back out.\n\nYour dude should have given you that cushion. If he can't tell you that, especially early on in the relationship when the stakes are low, how do you expect him to tell you anything?",

Based on your assertion that you guys are successful in your careers, I'd assume he probably is more adult than I am. I'm kind of childish.\n\nThen again I don't know. I know everything I owe I keep tabs on that.\n\nI'm only at like 20K but still.",

So he has to straighten himself out and you can have your own separate life. I\u2019m not dealing with that stress as I am almost out of debt.

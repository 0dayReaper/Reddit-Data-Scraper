    "postText": "So apparently since Nick Mercs had his operator skin removed, streamers have uninstalled call of duty. The same game that you bought while the company that made it was being scrutinized and investigated for having a frat boy work culture that openly joked about raping female employees and stealing BREAST MILK and DRINKING it. \n\nApparently allegations are fine but removing your buddies operator skin is where these people draw the line. I just had to let this out because of how ridiculous it seems considering they bought the game at full price while a full on investigation was taking place at the activision headquarters.",

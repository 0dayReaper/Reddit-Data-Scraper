    "postText": "I long to sink into the depths of despair, lost in the hazy embrace of drugs, drifting aimlessly through the streets without a home, until everything fades away. It feels as though all eyes are fixed upon me, eagerly waiting to witness my inevitable downfall. Will I ever find my way out of this suffocating darkness, or am I destined to surrender to the fate they have already assigned me? I can't help but feel like a burden, a worthless existence, a constant disappointment to my siblings, a source of pain to my parents, and a letdown to those who genuinely care for me. Damn it, Humph! Despite my awareness of it all, I am utterly incapable of mustering any care. The relentless storm of depression engulfs my mind entirely, leaving me devoid of any fucks to give about my own well-being. Perhaps that is the core of my struggle\u2014a deep self-hatred that has compelled me to run aimlessly for all these years, desperate to escape the grasp of my own desolation.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve never had a \u201cbestfriend\u201d or maybe I\u2019ve never had a friend. I always kept to myself for all 18 years of my life cause there wasn\u2019t anything to say, of course in school I had friends but they weren\u2019t the kind of people i would go outside with or even talk much to in groupchats. But I was content with it up until now, I realised how miserable and lonely of a person I am. In Nov I finally found someone that I actually wanted to talk to and started caring about. That feeling felt good someone to chat to all day and joke around with any time but that friendship ended with me being ghosted in January and me being angry at them. Since then my depression has gotten way way worse and resulted in me doing stupid things to myself. After all that I thought of course it ended like that because anyone that was a \u201cfriend\u201d to me just did it out of pity and that\u2019s the only reason people talk to me. There is a high chance that I am autistic but even then shouldn\u2019t I of been able to find someone I can truly connect with or am I destined to be alone and scared with my paranoid thoughts \n\nIdk just a vent i guess, a different place other than the notes app",

            "comment": "It's not necessarily that you're a bad person. I've only had one 100% genuine \"best friend\" where we shared EVERYTHING and that experience messed with me tbh. I'd share more with them then I would with a therapist. It was TOO vulnerable. \n\nSome people just aren't wired for best friends in the way that most people are outside of maybe their partner. Or that \"best friend\" just isn't the same as how other best friends are for others. Online best friends also aren't ideal since there's no accountability of knowing them in-person. It's just a voice or picture or text on a screen.",

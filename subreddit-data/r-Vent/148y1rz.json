It feels like i\u2019m a bother to people, my mental health gets in the way and i can\u2019t maintain relationships even though i want a friendship. it looks like nobody has my humor or interests. And i\u2019m too scared to fully act myself around people because nobody has my humor. i don\u2019t know, i\u2019m just upset knowing i don\u2019t have any.",

    "postText": "This is probably going to be boring and bad and not many people will see this but, it\u2019s better to type it out. \nI\u2019m a gay male and I have only recently come out, I happened to come out at the same time as this boy, who we will call T, and I never had an interest in him even after i knew he was gay. \nI\u2019ve only recently started to realise how perfect he is and now i have this soul crushing attraction to him. \nI\u2019ll go back in time, he used to have a girlfriend but me and him used to sext, we were friends but one thing lead to another and we eventually started exposing ourselves to eachother. \nit only happened once or twice and it then shortly died out afterwards, i still then, didn\u2019t have an interest in dating him or anything, and i just sexted him because i thought he was hot (douche move i know).\nSkip fowards a couple months and he\u2019s broken up with his girlfriend and he\u2019s come out and so have i. I was texting him about if ever had a bj as a joke, and he said no but he wanted one. \nI jokingly said i\u2019ll give it to him and he said he\u2019s down, we talked about it and more sex, unfortunately my dream never came to life. After that, he stopped talking to me and we haven\u2019t communicated in a few weeks, and i was fine with it until i started to develop the knowledge that i thought he was the hottest person in the world (which he is). \nI\u2019ve developed a crush for this guy only since he stopped talking to me, which is weird but, yk. It\u2019s been soul crushing, i love him so much and we don\u2019t even talk and i won\u2019t get a chance. I didn\u2019t realise the opportunity i had when i was talking to him based of how perfect he is. \nNow this crush has developed into this almost insanity stricken feeling. Idk what to do and i\u2019ve tried to forget him but i simply can\u2019t. \n\nHope you enjoyed this lol, love N &lt;3",

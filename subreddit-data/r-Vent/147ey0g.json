    "postText": "The minute I seriously think I have a genuine guy friend that enjoys my company and personality platonically. Every single fucking time I get proven wrong. It's insane. I've had a male friend that I would consider very close and trust worthy. He fully stated how similar my body is to another women in the most analytical objectifying way possible. He went into deptth about our large tits, our non existent waist, our similar weight and then topping the comment off with how my body is still more exaggerated. It genuinely ticks me off. I know he won't compare his male friends in that manner and especially not upfront to their face. \n\nI just feel i have so much more to offer as a platonic companion past my appearance. I'm aware that i'm a conventionally attractive girl and I've been told/enforced it many times. For the love of god I just want a normal friendship with a man that can view me as their friend and not a sex object/potential girlfriend. It's the worst sinking feeling to feel as though the time you invested in getting to know someone and value them was pointless.",

We notice a lot more than your physical appearance, but oftentimes the stuff we like to talk about is what makes girl friends and girlfriends leave. A guy who loves gaming and talks about it will have a hard time getting a girl, so instead of talking about us we talk about you and others, we just tend to choose the wrong topics",

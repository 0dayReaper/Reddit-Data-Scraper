I wouldn\u2019t go back to her.\n\nEither way I can def say that these things aren\u2019t normal for most people. I don\u2019t think most anything is inherently \u201cwrong\u201d except in how you act on them. That is to say: you don\u2019t *have* to have things like empathy or love for certain people so long as you still treat them decently.\n\nThe lying and manipulating is maybe not as good, but I don\u2019t live your life, you know? Not my business. \n\nIf ur wanting like, a diagnosis or whatever you should probably try a different dr. You can also just to research on ur own and kinda see what fits. I mean there\u2019s like a handful of things I thought about reading your post but I\u2019m not a dr or anything so I don\u2019t want to throw random guesses/accusations out.\n\nAt the end of the day your brain is your business, your actions I think are what matter\n\n(Sorry I get rambly when I get tired and it is late! I hope this all makes sense)",

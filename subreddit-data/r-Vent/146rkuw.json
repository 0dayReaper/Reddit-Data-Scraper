    "postText": "I'm a DJ and hangout at a nightclub where I have a good amount of friends. I was seeing a girl whom I have mutual friends with for about a month, and she then decided to break it off; this is very fine and I am not mad about that, however I've gotten word that when I hangout with my friends, she'll talk to them and ask \"why do you hangout with OP?\" This kind of drives me a little nuts, as she literally broke it off with me because she wasn't ready for a relationship, and then proceeds to talk shit about me to my friends. I was a gentleman to her, paid for our dates, and actually had a lot of feelings for her before she decided to end things. She's been diagnosed BPD, so i'm kind of assuming this might just be sort of an episode from her? Still, I don't deserve slander and I think it's kind of fucked up. Fortunately, my friends know my character, and haven't changed their behaviour with me; it just stings that someone is deciding to try and ruin my social reputation when I did nothing wrong. After research, I know BPD has ties with narcissism to a degree, so I'm sort of taking this as her version of damage control/ trying to control a narrative to make herself the victim, just at a loss for wtf to do about it. A part of me wants to ask her why she's decided to pick on me in this way, but I feel like it'll probably only dig a deeper hole, so here I am venting to all of you. Thank you for listening, if you have any advice lmk lol   \n\n\nsidenote: When she broke up with me, I had unadded her from facebook and instagram, and I think that really pissed her off if I was to guess what triggered the narcissism.",

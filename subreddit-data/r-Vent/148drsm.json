I want to work through my issues, but the moment I even imply anything, things start falling apart. I\u2019ve had to fix situations where I\u2019ve accidentally shared too much. It\u2019s starting to get so exhausting that I sometimes wonder if it\u2019s even worth it to continue therapy.",

In the US, \"duty to warn\" doesn't apply to \"any reference\", it's specifically for any expression of an *imminent* threat to self or others. Like \"I have a plan to shoot up my job\" or \"when I get out of here I'm probably going to hang myself\". Those things should be reported, a therapist should not be acting as a hostage negotiator. In Ontario, Canada, however, there is no \"duty to warn\" about a patient, legally. It's at the discretion of the therapist.\n\nBut, all that aside. If you are having problems with intrusive thoughts of an unspecified and non-imminent nature, they should absolutely be safe to discuss. Unless OP chimes in with more specifics, I don't think we'll really be able to know what exactly they are talking about.",

Patients/clients NEED to feel comfortable talking to their therapist, which means therapists can\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t be dropping a police report at the drop of a pin. \n\nThere are many ways to determine if a client is in imminent danger of self harm or harming others. Do they have a plan? Do they have the means? If they say they are going to shoot up a place, but don\u2019t have a gun, and don\u2019t know how to get a gun, it\u2019s not credible. \n\nIf OP is having suicidal thoughts, but hasn\u2019t done anything in 9 years, it\u2019s most likely just SI and there\u2019s no way the therapist would make a call on it, not after 9 years. Some people just have a lot of SI but if that\u2019s their baseline and is normal for them, they aren\u2019t a risk. Same with HI",

    "postText": "so, god this is gonna be a long one. \n\nSo about 3 days ago, i went into labor at around midnight, my bf then drove me to the hospital and then left to go back to sleep at home, i was a bit upset because this was my first kid and i hoped he would stay but i assumed he was just overwhelmed. \n\nNow, after i gave birth, i called him, he came to the hospital said he was sorry for leaving and all that, i said it was ok, even tho i was still upset but i was way too tired for dealing with it. I had read online that it would be polite to give  your husband/bf a gift now that hes a father, so i did that i bought him a new tie (he likes ties and has a huge collection). almost as soon as i gave it to him he said \"oh, by the way your not getting a push present. I had bought you earrings but, you were in labor for soooooooooo  long you just dont deserve a gift so im gonna return them. If there is a next time, just try harder? Jesus\". He didnt even say thank you, just said i didnt deserve a push present because i took too long giving birth, i don't know, that just made feel really not loved.",

I only went home to get clothes for her and snuck in her favorite breakfast food for her, that's love not what that POS did to you.

I highly doubt it though since he couldn't be bothered to be there with you while you were giving birth.\n\nTake time to heal from giving birth, and enjoy this amazing gift that God has given you.\n\nIn the meantime, I would make plans to leave him as soon as possible. I would also get with cps, and file for child support against him. You do not need this man in your life or your child's life, he sounds very self-centered, and if he couldn't even give you a pair of earrings, I doubt he'll give you anything else. There would never be a next time for me with him.\n\nI can't understand what type of man would just drop you off and leave, like it was no big deal. That should send red flags right there.\n\nI wish you the best of luck in the future with you and your child, and hopefully, you will meet the man of your dreams, that will love you and your child like you deserve to be loved.",

He denied being the father to my son, until DNA proved he was.  Hey then tried to gaslight my son, saying he never knew about me. I never said one bad thing about him to my son. I only told him the truth, that he said he would never be in his life. He finally stepped up to meet my son when he was about 17 years old, and wanted to be his father. By then, it was too late. They speak maybe once a year, but don't see each other. My son was so mad at me thinking I had lied about his father, but one day he told me you were right Mom, he's not even worth it. I said I'll always told you that you would find out the truth for yourself and he did.",

Uh, yeah, just no. Ok first, he probably didn't buy you a gift. He just said that to take the non existent \"gift\" away from you to punish you for doing absolutely nothing wrong. He punishes you for loving him. When you do something sweet or loving, he gives you pain. He doesn't love himself and he doesn't love you. This man is not a good man. He will only bring you pain.

So he made up getting a gift and then blamed you for why you\u2019re not getting it. That makes more sense than the logic of buying someone a gift and not giving it to them because they have birth to your child. Just saying lol",

I appreciate that you took the time to pick out earrings. How about you give me the receipt and earrings for now, I\u2019ll have (insert random friend here) return them, and whatever the cost of them is, I\u2019ll double towards a better gift for you!\u201d If he presents the earrings that don\u2019t exist imo, you keep them because he\u2019s an idiot. If he doesn\u2019t then you know he\u2019s so incapable of feeling any guilt that he will makeup fake gifts and issues to feel better about himself.",

If he's \"too tired\" to show up for the birth of your child, there's NO WAY he's going to wake up in the middle of the night to give the baby a bottle or change a diaper. Smfh the nerve of this guy saying he's \"too tired\" when you're literally pushing a whole human out of your body. Him saying \"try harder\" makes my blood boil when it seems like he literally puts in 0 effort. I don't know your boyfriend, but if he regularly acts like this, I can't see it getting any better. He just showed you who he really was. I'm sorry, and I wish you the best with your new baby \u2764",

    "postText": "I worked as a personal trainer for just about 10 years. The last 5 years of it I ran my own business. Things went well and then covid ruined everything. Lost the business. Lost my clients. \n\nI now work in real estate and it sucks. All I\u2019m doing is chasing paychecks in this terrible market. There\u2019s no stability whatsoever. \n\nAnytime I apply for a W-2 job I\u2019m told I don\u2019t have the necessary skills. It just feels like being self employed worked against me. I couldn\u2019t open my own gym again even if I wanted to.\n\nMy wife has a masters in occupational therapy but she can\u2019t get a job because of a gap in her career from covid. \n\nJust feels like my only option is to get a couple of minimum wage jobs and work 80 hours per week to provide for my family. \n\nThanks for letting me vent.",

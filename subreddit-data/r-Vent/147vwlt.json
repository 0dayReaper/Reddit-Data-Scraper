    "postText": "The moment he barrels into the bed, he gets under the top cover, kicking the sheets down to the bottom of the bed and he doesn\u2019t even realize he\u2019s doing it. Then somehow the top 2 corners of the fitted sheets are both coming off, and almost all of the sheet is over on his side of the bed. Not to mention, when he tries to \u201cfix it\u201d, he pulls and yanks on the elastic, making the issue even worse. By the next day, the blankets are twisted, upside down, sideways, you name it. It drives me crazy that the bed is ruined the moment he touches it because he just mindlessly barrels into it like a wild animal. I try to tell him the things he could do differently but it quite literally goes into one ear and out the other.\n\nMany nights he\u2019ll sleep in another room because he drinks and play video games late into the wee morning, which I have no problem with because I like to just peacefully watch my anime and get to sleep at a reasonable time. It\u2019s honestly comical the difference the condition of the bed will be in when it\u2019s just me and the dog sleeping in it vs me and my man. I love him to death but damn. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m dealing with a 200lb toddler. \nI will happily take any recommendations for a fitted sheet that even have the possibility of standing up to a wild bear.",

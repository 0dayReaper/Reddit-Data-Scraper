    "postText": "My girlfriend and I have been dating for around 3 years now (both 19 f), and it's been mostly great. I love her very deeply, and she loves me too. My only problem is that she will not visit me and my house, but I drive to hers an average of like once a month. In our 3 years of dating, she has come to see me around 4 times.\n\nwe are like medium distance, as she lives one state over. The reason she won't visit me is because she is a really fragile person. She has frequent long-lasting migraines, frequent stomach issues, and terrible motion sickness. She says she can't come over for just a couple of days because it's not worth the strain on her body. This I completely understand, but it's upsetting that she can't find the time to come over ever. I don't ever hear talk of her planning on coming up to see me, and the last time she actually did come see me, it was for a concert she wanted to see. I know she has issues, and I am 1000% willing to work around said issues, but it just hurts to feel like maybe she just doesn't care about where I'm from and seeing things I want to show her here. \n\nI'm planning on talking to her about this sometime soon, but I'm not sure how to bring it up, honestly. I just feel really defeated right now.",

            "comment": "Well since this is very clearly dealbreaker potential, I think you should discuss it with her sooner than later. \n\nHer physical issues are understandable but they also seem to have potential to act as a perpetual excuse for never having to make the effort to come see you. \n\nThat\u2019s obviously problematic and you should ask her to see it from your perspective in the relationship.",

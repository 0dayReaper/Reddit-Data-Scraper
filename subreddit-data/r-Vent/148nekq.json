    "postText": "For context i was dating my boyfriend (D) for about a year before i met this other guy (K) I immediately was enthralled with K and wanted to be with him and get to know him, at this time i was also starting to loose feelings for D, D and K were really good friends so you can see why this is complicated, me and K slowly started to get closer until i eventually broke up with D and started to date K, we had sex, went on dates i mean we were really close, and then one day, i relized i was missing D and that i was an awful person for breaking up with him and fucking his best friend, so me and D got back together and K and I are no longer on good terms because i broke up with K very cowardly and i was awful to him, now me and D are back together, theres stability and joy but i am starting to miss K again just like with what happened before when i was with K and started to miss D, it feels like i only really truely want what i cant have and its an awful place to be in, i dont want to hurt anymore people or tell them that ill be there for them forever because i just dont know anymore. i feel like theres no stability or trust in myself and i just dont know what to do, any suggestions?",

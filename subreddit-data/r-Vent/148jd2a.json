    "postText": "I met this girl a few months ago and, for awhile, we were great friends. We gave each other help, supported one another, found each other funny. I couldn't have asked for a better friend.\n\nThen I sent her a meme. It was an offensive joke about black people that I found funny - I've been a fan of offensive and risky humour for years. Thinking nothing of it, I sent it to her and was near-immediately blocked. \n\nI talked to her on an alt account and she called me a racist, told me she'd never speak to me again. Then she left. \n\nI miss her. So much. I feel like a fucking moron for losing someone like her. I don't know what to do. I just want to tell her I'm sorry but she won't believe me. I feel so worthless now.",

            "comment": "well if she reacts so harshly to something that you found to be simply funny then you two don't seem to mix well after all, it just took a while to come out.\n\nI mean, you are sorry, but your view of the meme being simply funny is still there and her view of it being inexcusable as well.\n\nWhat I am getting at is, this is a shitty situation, no doubt, but there is no reason for you to feel worthless, both your views are valid, but they just aren't compatible at all. It's not your fault or anything, just an unlucky coincidence. All you can do now is let go, the only other option would be to lie about your views",

    "postText": "It\u2019s not really a professional job or anything. I am literally a student and it\u2019s a part time summer job. They require a blazer when dealing with clients because they want to set a good image for refugees, single moms, etc. which is great but I went blazer shopping and they don\u2019t even fit me properly and it\u2019s so expensive like $160 + at places like ZARA. The cheapest was H&amp;M and they don\u2019t even look good on me and it\u2019s ruining everything. Now I hate my job and I don\u2019t want to go.",

I\u2019m pretty tomboyish but whenever I dressed more feminine he hates it for some reason. Also, for some reason he doesn\u2019t enforce it on me though, but it hurts when he laughs at women talking about their rights, and being a girl myself it sucks that my own father won\u2019t probably even support me if I spoke out.",

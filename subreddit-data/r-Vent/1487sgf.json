    "postText": "So I have been working on getting my Airframe and Powerplant license for a couple years now. And when I mean a couple I mean almost 10 years. And I keep losing motivation to get it done. When I get it it would mean a $20 an hour pay jump. Which should be motivation enough but my damn ADHD always kicks in and distracts me. I know I need to get it done. I have to get it done. I promised my mother on her death bed I would get it done. But something always pulls me away from just buckling down and getting it done. I feel like a terrible person but I just can\u2019t keep myself motivated. Me and wife are going to try and have kids soon and I know it needs to be done before the baby gets here or we will be in a deep financial hole. I just need to get this done.",

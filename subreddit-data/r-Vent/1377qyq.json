She really was the light in my life.\nShe was there when no one else was. She was the one who helped me try and love myself again. She was perfect in every sense of the word.\n\nShe told me she was going to marry me one day. We met last year, and started dating on the 16th of March. It was just our one year. We only went on one date. I promised I\u2019d take her on another, and we also wanted to go stargazing together soon. We wanted to do so much. But we can\u2019t anymore.\n\nI couldn\u2019t even get to say goodbye.",

I had a look at your profile and one of your posts about her is so wholesome :( My partner &amp; I also got together March last year so seeing someone who was in the same phase as our relationship makes me so sad.\n\nI really hope you are doing alright, it will be hard, but I promise you you can do it. Just keep reminding yourself that she's in a safe place and won't be hurt anymore, I don't know what you believe in, but she's safe. It might take some time to recover, and that's perfectly okay, take all the time you need, but eventually the pain won't be this bad. You'll miss her, but try think about the good memories and smile that they happened (if it doesn't hurt too much of course)\n\nMaybe when your feeling better you can go by yourself to the place you went on a date, and just try to live through those moments again. Maybe if you had a plan for the 2nd one you can go to that place and write her a note there or something &amp; put it in a box (as if you were giving it to her)\n\nI believe in you OP, it's not easy but I believe in you",

I'm deeply sorry for what you're going through. Just remember you have to keep going to keep growing. If you ever need to talk or vent or just know a human is listening, there can be immense comfort in the kindness of strangers. Send a PM if you need someone to lend an ear or give some advice or whatever you may need. You will make it through this. You have to. I believe in you",

I became a widow 13 mos ago this month by means of suicide so I definitely know the pain that you're feeling loosing your significant other.  The next couple months will be filled with so many different emotions that you've never experienced before.  Take care of yourself as best as you can; eat, sleep, and stay hydrated. Seek out counseling because it will truly help. Make a memorial for her, keep pictures up of her and of you 2, talk to her.  It may sound silly but it has been helping me",

Don\u2019t let it try to keep you from living. I know it\u2019s not the same, but my dog passed away in October last year, she was with me for 17 years. I was holding her as she took her last breathes, she died naturally. She was there for me when I was still a kid, grew into a teen, and into my adulthood and meant a great deal to my life. I bottle fed her when she was a puppy and we did everything together.  I currently still find myself in moments of deep grief and I don\u2019t really see it disappearing. The initial grief was very consuming for me though, I stopped eating, and doing things that I normally do. My grandmother died a month later due to a fall injury that left her internally bleeding, she died within a couple days. At that point my existence fell through the earth, I wasn\u2019t in my body anymore, but far off. The following month I lost my job due to an injury I\u2019ve been dealing with and recovering from for the past year. I became as nonexistent I could be without actually committing. I just didn\u2019t want to exist, to think, to feel, to be anything at all. Discipline yourself to still keep active with things you normally enjoy, take it a day at a time, and try new things once you feel ready. Don\u2019t be harsh with yourself when you fall back into grief, but ride it\u2019s wave and allow it to find it\u2019s settling place. Try to stay interactive with people who are a good support system, I\u2019m not a socialite, but it still helped me focus on something else. Journal about it all and use it as a way to reflect and remind yourself of the positive things that came from all of the time you did have with her. Grief comes because you actually cared and had an impact on each other that is a beautiful thing.  Loved ones have a way of appearing to say goodbye, even if neither of you could do it in the moment. Sometimes it\u2019s in dreams in other occasions, it can be odd events like an animal appearing and being open to you.",

I'm sure as much as she lit up your life, you lit up hers. The last year of her life could have been boring, or even bad if she was with someone else. But because it was you that final year was beautiful and full of love. And she has someone to love her still and grieve for her. To remember her and keep her alive in spirit. I hope this gives you some comfort, I hope that the pain becomes bearable soon.",

I can relate in many ways to that issue.\nI never lost a girlfriend in the way you have, but have lost them as my gf; Only recently have i truly realized some things\u2026When I was 21yo, my gf who was away at college in NYC(i was in DC)ended up hooking up with someone else, and we broke up..not like it\u2019s \u201cboohoo\u201d for me, cuz i mean wtf, she was in school, and tbh think i felt guilty for preventing her from really living it up fully, so it needed to happen. \nThe similar part is how i felt about her\u2026in hindsight, it wasn\u2019t very healthy, or guess I wasn\u2019t healthy, because she was everything to me\u2026\nLooking back, that was in many ways, the beginning of the end for me. Drugs along with no personal goals, and here i am at 40yo working a low paying job, and still tryna work through many issues. Ofc i\u2019ve had relationships etc since then, but eh i dunno exactly what my point is\u2026.just reading your words, I can\u2019t help but feel like we\u2019re similar in many ways, at least in this area. \nGuess i\u2019m saying- It\u2019s good that you\u2019re feeling your feelings; it\u2019s painful ofc, but something that you must go through. Please, i hope you don\u2019t let yourself become defined by this\u2026.remember that she would want the best for you; she\u2019d want you to live your life the best that you possibly can\u2026she\u2019d want you to be happy \nNot 2say it\u2019s bad you\u2019re feelin it, ya know, just sayin\n\n\u270c\ufe0f",

            "comment": "I'm sorry.\n\nI can only say that I know how it feels. I lost my girlfriend in 2012, and she was the best thing that ever happened to me. When she passed, I punished myself at first. I asked why it was fair for me to go on each and every day with her gone. Somehow, even looking at another girl seemed like I was cheating on her. No matter how many people told me to try and move on, it felt like I never should. It's not like I never could move on, but just that it felt wrong to do so. \n\nI decided to keep her alive through my memories of her. It has been eleven years, and I am yet to date anyone else. I live alone but I always set a table for two. I sleep alone, but always have the left side of the bed empty. I have a couch, but always sit on one side of it. People who know my story have sometimes perceived me as a romantic, and sometimes as a madman. \n\nI've just stopped caring.\n\nI know what I do and what I go through each day is not exactly healthy. I know that ideally, I should move on. I know that some of you could argue that she would want me to move on. But I guess that's the thing - I've stopped caring.\n\nI honor her by the only way I know how to - by remembering her each day, and by being true to the promises I made to her in the letters I wrote to her - that my heart is hers, and that nobody can replace her. I chose to put meaning in those words and live my life giving life to what I felt for her. Sure, there are days when it gets hard, there are days when I can't even picture her face with my eyes closed, and it scares me to think that someday I wouldn't remember her at all, and start questioning why I did what I did all these years. But I am choosing to go on, for as long as I can, and to love her as much as I can. It has become a routine for me, something that I no longer have to think about consciously. Every life has a purpose. I chose mine to be this. \n\nSo I know how you feel. I know that if you've read this far, my words may resonate with you and that you may think this is the only way your life would or should be from here on out. \n\nBut don't. \n\nEven though I am doing what I'm doing, I know there are other ways to feel alive and happy. I chose this for myself, but you don't have to. I want you to give yourself the option to \"be fine\" someday. \n\nI'm here to talk to you if you want. I'm here if you need anything. \n\nBut this is my two cents for you - \n\nDon't be me.",

I hit rock bottom.. we talked about getting back together that'd never come to fruition.. it was a very dark time as I was in my early 20s.. I got into drugs.. I was lost and miserable..  \n\n\nThat was 16 years ago.  I met my now wife while I was at rock bottom..  I let her go as I was an absolute shit show of a mess and we didnt talk for 5ish years.. We started dating 7 years ago and we've been married for coming up on 3 with a 2 year old daughter..   \n\n\nShe was my first for quite literally everything and I still think about her fairly often.  She'll always have a place in my heart but it doesn't hurt nearly as much as it did that evening I found out and while I do miss her but I wouldn't trade my life currently for anything.   \n\n\nGrieve. Take your time but know you will find someone that'll make you feel whole again with time. I'm genuinely sorry for your loss as its so fucking different than a breakup but take your time.. be happy for the time you got to spend with her..  It does get better.",

I wanted to marry her as well, but it wasn\u2019t to be\u2026\n\nI have asked many times \u201cwhy?\u201d and tried to come to terms with and make sense of it all (perhaps she was simply too good for this cruel world and deserved better?). I have had a long time to do that now. It does get easier with time but it will always stay with you, at least I think that\u2019s the case with me. As painful as it is to remember, I never want to forget her. To forget her would be to dishonour her.\n\nEvery once in a while I look up at the stars and wonder if she\u2019s up there somewhere looking back down at me. I really hope she is. You can still go stargazing with her, only now she is up there with them, waiting patiently for you to join her someday. I hope you can find peace until then.",

Be patient with yourself..\n\nThis won\u2019t help now but this quote helped me months later into grief\u2026. An old man on Reddit said this\u2026\n\n\u201cI'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not.\nI've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. here's my two cents...\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. But I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it.\n\nScars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too.\nIf you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\"",

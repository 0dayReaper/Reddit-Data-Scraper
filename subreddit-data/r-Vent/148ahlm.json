    "postText": "Ever since i was six I've been rejected by everyone, i was bullied, and no one helped me, i never even met any of the \"friends\" I've had outside school, whenever we stopped being part of the same group they just ghosted me, I never saw any of the friends i made after they transfered or we graduated, i feel like I'm just a speck of dust in the lifes of all the people I've met, actually, everytime someone talked to me or texted me was just to ask favors, vent about their problems or just get someone else's number, but i always end up alone, I've never had any significant friend, never had a girlfriend or anything even close to that, i don't even have the group photos from school anymore, i have nothing that's worth remembering, i wish i never existed, it wouldn't make any difference anyway, I've never been part of anyone's life.",

You can\u2019t give up on things you want or they will never happen",

    "postText": "My brother has been playing with people online, which props on him getting some friends to talk to over the summer, but we share a room, which is fine, but his new friends are apparently ahead of us in time, probably in Europe or something, because he talks to them past fucking 3 in the morning, and when I want genuine sleep, he\u2019s awake on the computer talking with them playing Minecraft. I really don\u2019t want to keep waking up at 12-2 PM anymore or staying up all night. It\u2019s not like I can sleep on the couch, we don\u2019t own one, and there\u2019s no spare room to sleep in. I might just end my life if I hear him making villager noises again. What a summer. I also can\u2019t talk to any friends with them hearing my brother talk, and anywhere else isn\u2019t better.",

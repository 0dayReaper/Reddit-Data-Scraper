    "postText": "For context I'm on the local train right now in my area of the state, and before I got on this young punk ass decides to skateboard pass me really fast he's not too close the first time so I ignore it and let it slide, he then does it again and gets closer to me the point where he could have hit me if he would have been any closer. I confront him and he throws a childish tantrum, trying to mock me then starts screaming and cussing and banging the skateboard on the bench nearby and telling me to shut up. We went back and fourth before he walked away. Mind you I'm not against skateboarding as I tried to do it myself. But this is getting ridiculous I've had multiple times where people almost hit me because they're being stupid and inconsiderate. \n\nIf you are a skateboarder please for the love of god with all due respect, stop skating inches from random people in public, it's inconsiderate and selfish. Ok end of rant, sorry for any offended by this but I am just sick and tired of it.",

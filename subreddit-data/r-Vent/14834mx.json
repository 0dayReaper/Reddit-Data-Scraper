    "postText": "I go to work every day sick and I wake up sick. I still got to go to work though for health insurance I can\u2019t even use because I am at work. Most money goes to paying for a place to sleep and food that gets me sick. On my days off I have to go to doctors who tell me that I\u2019m sick with too many diseases for them to deal with. The side effects of medicines stop me from working because I can\u2019t function at a job site Disability doesn\u2019t pay enough and I super hard to get on in my country. \n\nWhenever I go home most people in my personal life refuse to acknowledge my illnesses or pain. When most people look at me I don\u2019t look sick unless I\u2019m feeling really sick. My blood tests are so bad I am not faking it. \n\n\nWhen I am work I constantly have to deal with obscene amounts of work underpaid and can\u2019t wait to go home because I hate my job. At least at home I don\u2019t have to deal with this degrading work. But when I am at home I have to deal with people I don\u2019t want to deal with. At least at work I don\u2019t have to deal with family.",

My \u201cmother\u201d screwed around with our stepdad\u2019s son (he was underage). I\u2019ve been knowing this since I was a child so it messed me up a lot. Forced to keep a secret and now that the secret is out to the family, my \u201cmother\u201d feels NO SHAME. \n\nAlmost a month ago now, my mother called me accusing me that I had never told her about him and me. When I was younger and he was over 18, we did it. I honestly don\u2019t know why it happened but I do remember feeling very uncomfortable. I couldn\u2019t do anything though because I was scared someone would see me in that disgusting way. I felt trapped. \n\nAnyways, I told her I did tell her, she just never listens. She\u2019s a bad mom and her only way to make amends is to buy me and my siblings stuff. Later the next day, she tells me she\u2019s going to tell everyone about them and they\u2019re going to stay together. Our stepfather left, of course. I left for about a week with my sister crying and never being able to sleep. The realization hit. \n\nShe will always choose him over me. \n\nI felt weak and broken. How could she? I come back home with other my sister and her friend. We drink and drink and if you saw how I was, you\u2019d think I was crazy. My sister told me she was scared because I wasn\u2019t there anymore. I was crying and laughing. For the record, I\u2019m not a drinker at all. I just really wanted to forget feeling the way I was. The next 3 days were torture for myself because of the hangover so I was mostly in bed. After recovering from that though, I felt anger. \n\nNow we have our family here, some cousins and our uncle. As I said, this person feels so shame waking up at 2 am to go downstairs to this guy\u2019s room and do whatever the hell they do. She acts like a maid to this guy who she knows who has been with her daughter, underage! No longer am I underage though. She cooks for him, takes him lunch, cleans his disgusting pig room (cups, bugs, crumbs on his bed, etc), and more. Now she\u2019s switching rooms from her bedroom all the way upstairs 2nd floor to the BASEMENT. She\u2019s not even trying to hide it from the kids who are here in this house. \n\nEveryone acts like it\u2019s nothing though and it\u2019s driving me insane. Please, tell me. Am I crazy? Am I being over dramatic? If you want full details about how this has happened from the beginning to now, I can provide it all. I can\u2019t sleep.",

    "postText": "I (22f) met up with a guy and while we were driving around and talking he referred to his outfit as the one he wore to the gym. I was like \"WHAT??\" In my head but I just nodded and he did mention the gym a few times and basically confirmed that he just got back from the gym. In my head, I'm like, \"Okay we're not fucking?\" But I was also disappointed because I was there with a purpose yk? We live in a rural town with plenty of private spots in the outskirts and eventually we ended up parked and making out. \n\nWe mutually agree to go to the back seat and I knew he had for sure been to the gym because his armpits were a little ripe and I didn't suck him off. I usually do, we've hung out like 4 times already casually, but we just felt eachother up and then he put the condom right on and we got into doggy. I didn't feel anything, like no stinging or weird feeling. I'm hoping the condom was barrier enough. If it protects from ejaculation, hopefully it protects from hours gym sweat germs? \n\nI'm disgusted with myself. No regrets- yet. I'm hoping I don't throw my pH off too bad or end up with an infection. I peed right after and after an hour I got home and immediately showered.",

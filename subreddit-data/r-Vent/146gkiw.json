    "postText": "I feel confused when I think of my mom. She did a LOT that I can\u2019t forgive her for when me and my sis were kids. She\u2019s better now but still have a small sour taste in my mouth. \nAside from that I look up to her still. I see all the hard work she has put in and see her being so successful even while being a single mom (her choice but still). \nShe sees me as like I\u2019m something great but I\u2019m not. She was so upset when I couldn\u2019t keep up with other kids but she did change when she found out I was dyslexic. Tho because of mental health issues I still did bad. Tho no matter what I did I was always given some praise but no matter what my sis did it wasn\u2019t enough. \nI feel this heavy weight on my shoulders to be perfect at everything. I do my best to keep everyone around me happy while putting my feelings on the back burner. \nI feel like no matter what I do it isn\u2019t enough. \nIn a way I know I will never make as much as my mom but a part of me is beating myself up for not being able to. I want to feel like I am making her proud. I want to feel like I\u2019m making everyone around me proud. I want to feel like I\u2019m not constantly letting everyone down. Two jobs, all house chores, now going and doing work to be a vet tech on top of that. Not even paying for that either my mom is tho. Don\u2019t even pay bills but my bf does. They say I\u2019m doing fine but I know they are lying. I just want to take care of them like them me. My grandma is doing terrible physically and is going down hill fast. I wanted her to see me graduate. Maybe if I wasn\u2019t so in my own head I could have guaranteed like the rest of my old friends and classmates. I feel like I\u2019m falling behind. I am failing everyone. I\u2019m trying to not let everything get to me because everyone in my circle have it harder and I feel like I\u2019m not allowed to feel anything other than happy. I try so hard to be strong for everyone around me so they can feel like they have someone to lean on but I have no one or I guess I feel like I don\u2019t. I know I do, but like I said, I feel like I have to pretend I am ok so I am not more of a burden than I am. \nI feel like I wasted my life. I look at my mom and wonder how she did it. She and others make it look so easy but I simply can\u2019t get it. I just feel like a failure. All eyes on me to be great but I\u2019m not. I will never be like her and in a way that is destroying me inside. \n(Sorry this is all over but I needed to vent)",

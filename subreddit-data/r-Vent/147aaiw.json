    "postText": "My husband recently went on a business trip to Shreveport and cheated on me while there.  He didn\u2019t meet up with anyone but was receiving pictures.  He said he was going to meet up with someone but had second thoughts and decided not to because he loves me.  His reasoning was that he just wanted to hurt me so I would leave him and hate him because he thinks he\u2019s bad for me.  I can\u2019t even cry, my body won\u2019t let me.  Our relationship wasn\u2019t perfect but I never in a million years thought he would cheat.  Ever.  I believe marriage is sacred and we both come from families where everyone treats it like a contract and there\u2019s no love but I thought we both wanted to be the ones in our families who made it different.  I thought we could make our marriage mean something and break the generational curse of cheating.  It feels like someone took a shotgun and blasted a hole through my heart.  He was my high school sweetheart, the man I lost my virginity to, my best friend, my everything.  I feel empty like a shell of who I was.  Crazy how a five minute conversation can shatter your whole existence.  I\u2019ve been there for him through every major life event,  every major emotional rollercoaster I was there being his rock.  (He was there for me too).  What\u2019s crazy is I could tell something was off when he got home from that trip but I didn\u2019t know what.  I don\u2019t wanna leave him, but I don\u2019t know how to continue.\n\nEdit:  Thank you all so much for the well wishes and advice.  I appreciate them all.  I tried to respond to all of you.  We talked it out and decided to attend therapy together and both separately.  I\u2019ve chosen to test the waters and see if this can make us stronger.  If it doesn\u2019t work out, it doesn\u2019t work out I am however hoping for the best. Again thank you!",

And it's so painfully obvious how much you love him, how deeply you care----how, in the face of this unspeakable agony, you're still compassionate to the things he's suffered. In your heart, you're still defending him-----don't ever let anyone call you weak because to continue loving someone who hurt you this intimately is something else. Ive been cheated on too-----it fucking almost ruined me. It turned all of the love in my heart into hatred, then apathy. \n\nYou are capable of so much love. And one day, that may become forgiveness and healing. But forgiveness and healing doesn't always mean you have to stay. \n\nNgl my instinctive reaction is to tell you to dump his unfaithful ass-----you wouldn't be at fault. He threw away the relationship the moment he broke his promise of fidelity. But this is a choice only you can make now. \n\nJust .... the pain is immeasurable now, but you are capable of loving and being loved again by someone who won't betray you.  \n\nIf you choose to stay in this marriage, will you ever be able to trust him again? Or will you be consigning yourself to a lifetime of always doubting him and always fearful of what he's up to?\n\nHugs. I hope you find peace. And if ever you start to wonder if this is your fault, it isn't. Beyonce got cheated on lmao. Princess Diana got cheated on. Emily Ratajkwskskji (sorry lol idk how to spell it) got cheated on. Jacqueline Kennedy was cheated on. Women renown for their beauty, charisma, talent, wealth----have still been betrayed. It is always on the partner who chose to be unfaithful and never you.",

Maybe that\u2019s really how he feels, you would know best here, but family trauma doesn\u2019t excuse this behavior. If he has a traumatic past, it\u2019s only going to get worse if he does not confront that through professional help or at least in a way that helps him through it.\n\nYou seem pretty in tune with what\u2019s going on objectively and that\u2019s a good thing. But you don\u2019t deserve to be a victim of his traumatic past. You deserve someone who chooses you first before testing the waters. Prioritize yourself here.

If he\u2019s unhappy with himself, but he loves you, he has a responsibility to assess his own mindset, to get to the bottom of his own insecurity, and try to improve himself if he feels like that\u2019s what\u2019s needed, for the sake of both you and your relationship. If he\u2019s manufacturing chaos, even without realizing it, in order to test your loyalty, or to falsely create a sense of control and validate his own negative self-image via predictable failure, he needs to correct his victimhood complex\u2026 because he\u2019s not one. He has choices, and he made several to betray your trust. \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re going to therapy. I truly believe that\u2019s your only hope for salvaging and healing your marriage. But I would suggest that you take care to remain aware of and analytical in that possibility. Don\u2019t fall into the trap of reassuring him if it ever means rugsweeping or downplaying your feelings, and don\u2019t let his insecurity serve as an excuse or an apology. Remember that honest remorse is shown when one takes full, unilateral accountability for their actions and commits to recognize and understand the factors within their control to ensure that it won\u2019t happen again. An apology without accountability and action to change is simply manipulation.",

Slip ups happen. But those are usually hidden. Hearing that he actually told you about it and hearing about how he felt remorse makes me see the silver lining in this. Definately go to marriage counselling. It's not easy and both of you will have to do the homework and put in the effort but with an open mind for the both of yous- maybe things could take a turn for the better",

How do you feel being with them? Do they love you the way you want to be loved? &amp; would you want their life if you switched places?",

Or he's simply making a quick excuse to end it because for some reason he can't break up himself and want this burden to be on you. \n\nDon't feel bad. He's putting you in a confusing situation and that's on him. \n\nRegardless, what he's doing is not okay, plus he's cheating on you and lying (as he did in your other post). It's okay to leave. It's okay to get a divorce. I understand that you want to believe that marriage is sacred but this type of thinking also traps so many people in toxic, abusive relationships. And your husband continuously lying to you is toxic. \n\nPlease, think about yourself and realize that you deserve better.",

I know now a lot of my self destructive behavior -sabotaging my BEST relationships to make them feel more like my family relationships - the ones where I was always the villain, even as a kid, no matter what I did. It is genuinely hard to accept when you actually have some one that sees you in a positive light. It makes you think \u201cI must have tricked them. They don\u2019t know I\u2019m \u2018evil\u2019, that I\u2019m a \u2018failure\u2019 that I\u2019m the \u2018biggest mistake my mother ever made\u2019.\u201d And telling them just makes them go \u201coh honey you\u2019re not a failure.\u201d bc they feel bad for you. But in your fucked up little brain you think \u201cthey don\u2019t know. They still are brainwashed by me. I have to break them out of it. I have to SHOW them, then they will see. And they will leave. \u201c \n\n\nit\u2019s hard to develop properly after being raised by some one who takes the very act of you breathing as a personal attack. \n\nthe relationship I sabotaged ended. But it was becuase I broke it off. Clean cut. After burning it so much. Even his forgiveness twisted like a knife in my heart bc I could see how much I fucked him up because of MY trauma. Becuase I had entered us into a cycle of pain and chaos perpetuated by me. \n\nMe and him are still friends. He\u2019s my oldest friend. And sometimes I think about how much I hurt him and I still hate myself. But I can\u2019t try to fix it. The more I fox it. The more broken it becomes. I had to be on my own and work on my own trauma. And eventually I found a new partner. when he tells me I\u2019m a good person, I don\u2019t bite back with \u201coh you just don\u2019t know\u201d.  I believe him now. it took my whole life but I finally was able to accept that the way that I was raised to see my self was abusive and wrong.  \n\nI just wish that I knew that back then. \n\nI don\u2019t know if your husband can heal with you beside him. Or if he needs to be like me and heal some place else. if you can afford therapy, you\u2019re already better off than me.\n\nas human beings. We are doomed to recreate the stories of our youth. The sins of the father are paid by the son.  even if we know on a surface level it is not a good path. We tread the steps of our parents reguardless.

The moment someone breaks that promise, the marriage itself isn't sacred. \n\nHis excuses show what he would do when feeling those emotions and that way of reacting to his emotions are unhealthy and dangerous for you.  If anyone has low self esteem it does not give them the excuse to hurt. If anyone has high self esteem it doesn't either. \n\nHe doesn't prioritize you. It might seem like he does but what he prioritizes is himself. It's just not the normal superficial kind and the self esteem kind.   If he prioritized you, he would have never have told you, never had thought of hurting you or even had attempted to do it.  The only reason he stopped was because he didn't want to feel guilt afterwards. It's why he told you, he prioritized his own sense of guilt over making you happy. If he wanted you to leave him, he could have just opened up the relationship or done anything else but he decided to try to cheat. \n\nOp he needs therapy and you need to reevaluate your relationship.  I get the feeling he is dangerous. If being in low mood makes him think it's ok to cheat then one has to wonder what else he will do in a low mood.  I hate myself a lot of times but I would never dream of hurting others because I care. I care about people.",

    "postText": "18F. My physical health has gotten progressively terrible over the past year after easing up for a few months and letting me be a normal person for a while before taking that life away from me again. This time last year, I was meeting up with tens of people, going swimming, drinking, staying out for hours, going out almost every day, maintaining all my friendships, making new friends, I was at college and learning new things etc. This time this year, I have no close friends left, I haven't met up with a friend in months, I can't get out of bed most days, every single day is so predictable that it kills me and I dropped out of college because of my health. \nI have been on new medication and my physical condition has gotten worse to the point that I can't be out of my bed for longer than an hour, I have to take pain killers several times a day, and I don't even have the energy to hold a conversation online with any of my friends so I've slowly just lost them all. \n\nI'm 18 years old, I'm supposed to be at my peak physical health around now and instead I'm bed ridden and living my life like I'm in an elderly home. Which wouldn't bother me so much if I'd actually lived a life before this. I started getting ill when I was 13. I used to be a social butterfly before then but then my social anxiety got out of hand. I've never been like, a coughing vomiting kind of ill. It has always been my body just feeling like it's deteriorating at a record pace. Normal tiredness turned into severe exhaustion in a few years, a few pains and aches turned into constant pain and discomfort. Last year I experienced life as a normal teenager, so briefly but it happened. I went to college after dropping out of secondary school because of my medical issues, and then after a year at college I had to drop out again for the exact same reasons. I made new friends, I tried new things and went to new places. I got invited to places and added to big group chats, I was on so many peoples close friends stories and I always had new pictures of new situations I was in every other day, I could make friends with any random person I met on a night out and I didn't even have to deal with drama or anything because people generally liked me. I was a normal teenager for around 10 months, then the exhaustion came back and I stopped being able to function. \nI stopped being able to reach out to people, I stopped being reliable or there for anyone because it started to get so hard to just survive each day. And because of that, people stopped reaching out to me and inviting me places because I was gradually becoming more and more absent.  I was only able to focus on my closest friends, but even then Ive ended up being unable to hold conversation with any of them in person without becoming wildly exhausted. \n\nNow, those people are in new circles. After saying we would be a close group of friends for years suddenly the entire group has just scattered. This seems to happen with every group I'm in where I'll be naive enough to think it'll stay like this for ages and then after a year at most everyone will just move on to different groups. I don't know if it's my fault for not being able to move on so easily before everyone else does or if it's just how friend groups work and I'm genuinely just not socially aware enough to catch up. \n\nRegardless, now every day is the same for me. I sleep, I go on my phone, I maybe get up to go toilet or get some food if I'm lucky, then I sleep again. I have got no quality of life, I'd be just the same if I was in a hospital bed. It's been like this since January, but the downward spiral started last September. I kind of wish that I hadn't had that year of actually enjoying life, because experiencing that, and then going back to how I was before, without any choice in the matter, has just broken me mentally. It would've been one thing to just stay the same physically for that year and live in blissful ignorance of what life could feel like, but instead I had to go out and have fun. And now I feel like I can't ever be satisfied with the life I'm stuck with because I know how much better it feels to be healthy and wi people, but I can't do anything about it.\n\nIf the rest of my life looks like this, I don't want it anymore. It sounds dramatic but I genuinely have got nothing to look forward to any day. Nothing new ever happens. Nothing interesting has happened to me in over seven months That's over 200 days of exhaustion and boredom.  I keep having to remind myself that when things got better before, It was very sudden. And maybe that will happen again, but the pessimist in me (which unfortunately is just me now) tells me that even if that does happen, it won't last and I'll just have to make up for it with more exhaustion and pain.\n\nI am just so sick of living like this. Even if all my health issues resolve themselves overnight, my relationships and my education have still been completely ruined - multiples times - by this, and will be insanely exhausting to try and rebuild or start again. Not to mention the mental effect that this is so hard on me\n\nAnother thing kind of related, it's so difficult to even try and figure out what's wrong with me. It's not just like a small thing, whatever is wrong with me has ruined my life and stops me from being able to do normal daily things, like get up and get a glass of water, without feeling like I am about to pass out. But going to a doctor is so exhausting that I just avoid it at any cost.\n\nBecause I started getting sick when I was like 13, my mum was still quite involved with my doctors appointments and whatnot, and because I haven't gotten any better since then, she still involved because I haven't had a chance to figure out how to deal with it myself since I've just been continuously sick.\n\nAnd for years she made me go to various doctors and clinics, and every issue I had felt like I had to go to a doctor about it, so much so that I literally began refusing to go to the doctors because it was so exhausting. And every doctor I would go to would ignore me or dismiss my pain as \"hormonal\" or an \"exaggeration\" because I'm a teenage girl, and surely I don't know what real pain feels like. And being told that you're being dramatic when you're in pain is so damaging as a young teenager, so because of the constant dismissal and invalidation, going to the doctors is just such an exhausting process to even think about. So even though my health has gotten so bad that I am literally bedridden, I've still only gone to a doctor maybe three time in the past year and even those times that I went in the past year I was dismissed as dramatic because I'm still a teenaged girl. It is infuriating that something could be seriously wrong with me, but I just wouldn't know because no doctor will give me the time of day or understanding to listen to me when I tell them that I am in constant physical pain.\n\nAnyways end of vent ! \ud83d\udc4d",

    "postText": "Last year, my little, T (currently 20F), mentioned she wanted to go to Disney with our fam for her birthday, it took me (currently 21F) a whole year to save up the money since I am in college and was fortunate enough to not have to work to focus on school/summer courses after struggling a lot the past few years.T knows that I am not wealthy by any means, I still pay for some expenses using my savings which I don't have much of anymore. When it got closer to her birth month, suddenly it had gone from going to Disney to going to Disney and Universal Studios. I explained that I really could only afford to do one park, which she said was okay. I didn\u2019t know if T had asked other people to come so once we figured out where we going, I asked my mom if she could drop me off and pick me up at the theme park so I didn\u2019t have to pay for parking, well, as it turns out T only invited me and to no one\u2019s surprise, also needed a ride. I no longer lived on campus so to get her it was another 30 minutes out of the way and my mom who has health problems really needs her sleep or it really affects her. Honestly, after commuting every day in rush hour traffic I really didn\u2019t want to get up an hour earlier to get her when I already had to get up at 7 am to be ready to leave at 9 am so I said we could take her but she would have to get a ride to my house. I always end up footing the bill for any parking or gas expenses because I have a car and T doesn\u2019t. This was for HER birthday so, I, not knowing the full plan, chose to start making my own plans for transportation. Usually, when someone invites you for their birthday to do something, you do what they want and since she organized/initiated it, I figured she would have some kind of plan or agenda.  She then asked me how long we would be staying, which anyone who does amusement parks and isn\u2019t a pass holder knows you either go open to close to get your money\u2019s worth or open to whenever you get tired, in hindsight this was my first clue how the day would go. I usually like to get my money\u2019s worth, but since it was her day I asked her if she had a preference, which she expressed she wanted to leave Disney at 6 pm because she was going to Universal the next day, didn\u2019t want to wake up early either so eventually we agreed to leave my house at 9 am. She mentioned that she was trying to see if her friend could take her home from my house at the end of the day too, so I said if they can\u2019t to let me know and I can help her figure something else out (a.k.a Uber, Lyft, etc.). HOWEVER, I was extremely careful to not say that I would take her because I\u2019m not in shape right now and Disney can tire you out so I had a feeling I would be exhausted after, taking her home was not something I wanted to commit to or pay for\u2026 Long story short, we ended up getting to Disney at 10 am after she came late and left at 8 pm. Luckily, we only did one park but as soon as we got there she decided she wanted to get the Genie+ because 45 minute is too long for her to wait and didn\u2019t have any idea what she wanted to go on, so I ended up having to take over in terms of planning. I wouldn't say I am as Disney adult, nor do I expect her to be, that would have been fine but honestly I would have just preferred she was honest beforehand that she\u2019s never been. Now, I had to quickly make a game plan, which if you have ever been, having to use the app is essential and a life saver if you don\u2019t go often but it drains your battery. Unfortunately mine was not fully charged because it updated and turned off when I was sleeping and I was not as prepared as I usually am because I had a busy week and this was not all about me day. I was able to figure out a loose plan with the fast passes but at this point, I was bracing for a long day.We ended up going on a couple rides when she wanted to eat, after describing a few places I quickly looked up, she asked what one was healthy. Eating healthy is not necessarily easy nor leaves many choices at Disney. I was not extremely hungry so I didn\u2019t mind that it took her an hour to find a place but instead of letting me save my battery, she was using MY phone. T knew I needed to save my battery as much as possible to call my mom and communicate where to get us at the end of the day because we are new to the area and aren't Disney locals so I was anticipating some difficulty with my mom being able to pick us up. Anyways, after a bit of walking around she finally found a place to eat at which unfortunately really didn\u2019t have anything that I liked, so in order to save time so we could make our next fast pass I ordered my food on the app because I was hungry by then. I didn't realize T ordered a full blown meal so T ended up having to carry a tray with her food from Soarin\u2019 to Carsland. This was unintentional but I told her before she ordered that in order to make our next fast pass we had only an hour so I was going to order food that I wanted close to the ride so that way when she gets her food we would go get mine and eat in Cartland close to our next fast pass. I wasn't interested in the food she wanted so respectively I was going to get food I wanted. My food was right by the next ride so logically it made sense to eat there so we didn\u2019t have to rush. Once we got our food and ate, we then did our next fast pass ride.\n\nThe rest of the day went fine other than the fact that at the end she started getting a bit whiny about missing her boyfriend which sounded a lot like that part in up where Russell has to go to the bathroom. I can let go and look past everything from this point had it not been for the fact that for the rest of the day T still never helped with navigating or fast pass bookings. Before we left, we went to get beignets in Downtown Disney, which by then my feet were blistered. However, I had said when we got the tickets, I was going getting beignets for my mom as a thank you for driving at the end. As I was painfully, hobbling to get to the store, T  suddenly blurts out, \u201cI don\u2019t want beignets, so we really don\u2019t have to go.\u201d I stopped dead in my tracks, I mentioned trying them but I wasn't going for T it was mainly for my mom for getting up early and late to get us... and for saving me money on parking. At this point I was tired, I was a bit annoyed that the entire 9 hours we spent in the park not once had she even offered to use her phone for navigation, and felt like the comment was unnecessary so I just gave a slightly grumpy \"You don't have to but I told you I was going for my mom.\" I could hardly walk much more but after everything I did to make the day happen and having me get up early just for T coming an hour late, I felt that standing in a line with me was the least T could do. After getting beignets my mom and I were trying to find a place to meet at so it was a bit chaotic, considering I hardly could walk and the original pickup spot was did not work so I quickly sat down to regroup and figure out a plan quickly since my phone was at 2% at this point.When I found a spot I quickly said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go,\u201d to T and started walking, as I called my mom back. After about 2 minutes I realized we were walking in the wrong direction and stopped to figure out which way to go when I noticed T was missing suddenly. At this point I was panicking because I didn\u2019t know where to go, my mom couldn\u2019t stay longer than 5 minutes where she was, my phone was about to die and T was nowhere to be found. I started panicking as I quickly tried calling T, only for a man to answer her phone and tell me that T left it where we were sitting. I wanted to scream. Luckily, T's phone was on the way to where my mom so if I found her then we could just quilt get the phone on the way to my mom. I made the choice to get T's phone and go to my mom, but give stores on the way her description and that if they saw her if they would mind letting her know where I was going to be near the Pandora store. Shortly after getting T's  phone, all of a sudden T is tapping on my shoulder. While I was glad she was okay we didn't have time to talk about it and had to hustle our way to my mom.When we got home around 10 pm, T made herself unusually comfy on my parents couch, I\u2019m all for being comfortable, but at the same time you don\u2019t put your shoes on people\u2019s couches, a polite person would take them off. I had to ask if T could take her shoes off when I went over to hand my mom her treat. T apologized... but this wasn\u2019t the first time this happened. I feel like that\u2019s common sense and ironically, in her culture you usually leave shoes outside. I was honestly appalled that T would do that again, especially in front of my mom. I was still eating my beignets and getting a bit tired, my mom had already left so I said, \u201cIs there anything you want to watch while you wait for your friend to come get you?\u201d T goes \"Well right now I'm really feeling Soul,\" then a minute later goes \u201cOh yeah my friend can\u2019t take me so you're going to have to take me home... but it can be when you finish!\u201d I HAD IT! \"Glad to know it\u2019s okay with you that I can finish my food before I can take you home! We were together for the whole day and not once did you think to say anything to me about this?!?!?!?,\" I thought. Idid not want to say something that I would regret, so I just grumbled, \u201cLet\u2019s go now then, I\u2019m tired,\u201d and then drove her home, not without a comment about my driving, of course. When I dropped her off, I got a \"Bye, thank you!\" I was fuming, no don't apologize for the inconvenience or offer any gas money for having to drive 30 minutes to drop you off and 30 minutes to drive back. Why did she feel that I HAD TO DRIVE HER BACK when T could have arranged an Uber or Lyft? I am not her chauffeur and the fact she acted so nonchalant when she said I could take her home, had me seething.I was planning on talking to T about this situation because, unfortunately, at Disney, I told T that I would still do the official sorority fam letters that bigs and littles do together as T's gift at Disney. Once the little is initialed and finally able to wear the official ones the big and little make their own pair together. I figured I would try to talk to T one last time before I gave up, but since I am always driving T around, I decided that I was not paying for T's (I did not say I would or wouldn't yet).One month later, I texted T about meeting up so I could tell T in person now that break was over, but T hadn\u2019t answered until 17 days later, which conveniently was when T wanted to ask me about parking where T lives since I used to live there.\n\nA few days later, when I was driving to the movies with my dad, suddenly I was getting a call from T asking to borrow a hair dryer. My dad knows pretty much everything he's like my bestie and has always been there for everything. We both wondered why T would be asking me to borrow a hairdryer when T could have asked anyone in the sorority house or went across the street to buy one at the store. I told T I was at the movies, if she needed it she could come get it once I got back home. When she came to get it after 11 pm fyi, apparently she went to my old complex\u2026 I MOVED OUT 6 MONTHS AGO. Mind you, T was literally at my house back in November and 2 months ago when we went to Disney. T called after she realized and gave her usual I don't have a car so I can't get it from you trying to fish for me to say I would drive it to her\u2026BUT I REFUSED. I always go out of my way for T, especially when it come to driving and this time I wasn\u2019t going to be so accommodating. Why should I drive 30 minutes each way to give T my nice hairdryer I bought, when T could\u2019ve just bought one at the store across the street or borrowed from someone in the sorority house. Was it really that urgent to call me multiple times and a bunch of frantic messages to borrow my dryer?I'm over being treated this way, I don't know a better way to say it but T\u2019s very clueless and I don\u2019t think she even realizes what she does, but it\u2019s not my job to be her parent as her big. I shouldn't have to teach T manners and to be considerate/ treat your friend the way you want to be treated. By letting it go, I fear that I\u2019m just excusing poor treatment of myself. I mean how do I know that T even listens to anything that I say or even consider me ever, much less respect me? We have had a conversation about the gas situation and it didn\u2019t improve or change at all, despite her saying it would. Picking up is expensive especially 2 littles and I used my saving to pay dues and picking up among other things, I already don't talk to one so it would sting to waste my money on both littles since I don't talk to my other one after a disagreement. I feel like I\u2019m being used and taken advantage of and know how to bring it up with her, much less, if it will work after the last time I had an issue. I still feel apart of the sorority even though I left, so we started making sorority jackets with my adoptive little (20F) but after taking some time to think, I decided that once we are finished I don\u2019t plan on hanging out with T again. I don\u2019t think T is this horrible person and if she texts me I\u2019ll be nice, but I don\u2019t even know if this is truly worth saving or investing time into this relationship anymore since the letters is my last big duty. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so tired of not having boundaries and having friends like this no matter what I do, I am not perfect but I am a good friend. I feel horrible because I don\u2019t think she is this horrible person and she\u2019s my little. I\u2019m not perfect but I believe in the power of choosing kindness no matter what, but I don\u2019t even know if this is truly worth saving. This choice might be obvious to some or a dumb conversation, there\u2019s definitely worse things happening but I am completely torn between if there\u2019s anything worth saving in this relationship or whether I\u2019d be better off with this relationship, let alone how to even have a conversation about this. All I know is that I WANT BETTER.",

            "comment": "**If Needed...** \n\n**Context:** My little T (20F) doesn\u2019t have a car and I don\u2019t mind driving T but she never offers any money for gas or for parking even after having a conversation about being frustrated by this. It seems like she always assumes and expects me to drive too which upsets me further. We are both out of state students and I understand that since she doesn\u2019t have a car and I do, naturally, I would be driving more unless we take an Uber or something, but she never even asks me if I\u2019m okay with driving.  \n We hardly hang out but when we do it seems like it is because she needs something from me, and when we do hang out it seems to always be what she wants to do/eat even when I plan it. With all due respect, I honestly don\u2019t know if she is just playing mind games or if she even realizes it to be honest. She does things like putting her dirty shoes on my parents\u2019 furniture and she kept putting off the stuff she had to make for her little because she was too tired (she\u2019s a writing major and I\u2019m a biology and criminology double major so our work load is drastically different) so I ended up doing most of the work for HER little that she was picking up. Note: this all happened right after my birthday, and I was a bit disappointed because I kinda thought she would have wanted to hang out, when we always go out or get together for hers. This was the first birthday I had after meeting her, I was turning 21, my grandma just died, I finally left my toxic sorority, my other little R and I had a falling out, so this year was a big deal for me. I probably should not have gotten my hopes up, that was on me. I didn\u2019t really think much about it and just wrote it off that she was busy, but I started paying closer attention our friendship after she called me when I was hanging out with my other friends for my birthday. I said I was out with my friends at the moment and asked if I could talk to her later unless it was something important, she said she really need to talk to me, only to proceed to talk to me for an hour about her needing my help because she was picking up, this guy she met, some tmi things they did, and bunch of drama she\u2019s in and how she is really good looking according to the beauty standards of her ethnicity and everyone is jealous of her. I feel like that conversation definitely could have waited for a more private time when I was not with my friends, much less, need to hear everything detail. It is not that I am annoyed about her confiding in me but it just gave me an off feeling, it felt like a lack of respect considering I told her I was out with some friends, who were taking me out for my birthday....",

            "comment": "**Backstory:** Looking back I gave up a lot and missed out on a lot because I was working extremely hard. I have a learning disability so I have to work a lot harder in school. I thought that I would get to at least enjoy the end before I started college but things just didn\u2019t work out that way and it really messed with me. School was everything to me and a lot of things that were important to me were taken away from me at the last second. I\u2019m trying not to miss any important details or make this too longer than it is but I've been holding it in too long.  \nI never thought I\u2019d join a sorority, but since I lived across the country and had to do the first year of school online, a sorority was the only way I knew how to meet people and still get some college experience.   \nI ended up picking up 2 \u201clittles\u201d which is basically like little sisters. One of them I knew and we had a great relationship and I really wanted her, R, and the other one I didn\u2019t know until after I agreed to pick her up, T. I thought about if that was me in that situation and that you miss out on 100% of the opportunities that you don\u2019t take. I spent +$600 on the both of them combined which was my savings and hard earned money but I never wanted it to be like they\u2019re in debt to me because of it. I did it out of love and excitement, maybe even a bit of stupidity because my big wasn\u2019t around to guide me through it, because I was genuinely so excited to mentor them and welcome them to my fam. My Big-little experience was one of my favorite memories and I am still extremely close with my Big. I was really committed to treating them equally so one would not feel more wanted over the other but admittedly I had a lot more in common with one over the other.  \nMy first year was online and I loved the sorority, would have done anything for it, and even got Freshman of the Year. Then, when we went back to in person classes again, it was time for me to move 2,000 miles away from my hometown and I moved into the sorority house for my second year. Unfortunately, things turned sour and suddenly I found myself being targeted which ultimately culminated after they wrongly accused me of being a bystander to hazing when I was not even in the room because I was telling somebody that they did not have to do anything they did not want to. My sorority was trying to bring back a pre-pandemic tradition that was a tik tok dance and after my little, T, expressed sadness about the cancellation of it (she was the coordinator for it), my other little, R, thought it would be a good idea to try to help her (T) at least get constructive feedback to potentially see if there were things that could be done to help save it. I joined to support my littles and I genuinely wanted to support the new members as well. I even made a point to reiterate and make sure everyone knew that they very much did not have to do anything they did not want to do, I told them that I am always there for them and that they could always talk to me or anyone else. I then reminded them that again they absolutely did not have to do this if they didn\u2019t want to do this and we won\u2019t bother them again, that it would be appreciated if they could just let us know. Anyways, long story short, someone did not want to and I was out of the room telling them that was totally fine, if they changed their mind that I would certainly work with them but regardless their decision was completely respected and understandable, yet they ended up telling exec that I was sharing their medical information and another person said that I said they couldn\u2019t leave, even though I never spoke to another New Member. No one stood up for me and apparently there was a lot of \u201cblame shifting\u201d and they said that despite being the most apologetic and having zero intentions of doing anything but spending my morning before my midterm supporting my sisters, it didn\u2019t matter because of the impact the situation had on the new member class. It hurt because I felt completely betrayed and hurt because it felt like my \u201csisters\u201d didn\u2019t even know who I was, I mean I was not even in the room to see what went on during the dance practice part. I was ashamed, hurt, homesick, and frustrated because that is the complete antithesis of the kind of person I am. I personally was forced to do something that I didn\u2019t want to do and was actually trying to change things so that new members would not be put in the same place I was, so the accusations were contradictory to what I was trying to reform at the time. I couldn\u2019t move out of the house without being homeless, I felt like I was walking on eggshells around everyone, talked about incessantly, and was failing school because of the time I put into the sorority and how badly it was effecting me, which was what I thought was a measure of my value.   \nI was supposed to move in with my little (R) and then the week after housing applications she said she didn\u2019t want to anymore because she was worried that if there was a conflict it would ruin the friendship. Housing is extremely limited and if you apply 5 hours after it opens you will be on a waitlist. I respected her decision and tried to offer a solution to her concern, not to force her or pressure her at all, she thought about it and ended up deciding that she still wanted to live separately. I was a bit hurt and stressed out because I was taking a lot of classes at the time, dealing with the drama, stressed about housing now and finding a roommate since I now would be applying for housing a year late knowing my chances of getting campus housing was a 1 in a million shot and I would be homeless for a week regardless unless I found an affordable apartment off campus. In retrospect I unfortunately took it out on her a bit, I tried to express my feelings to her so I could move on and so we could find a way to work through it but she didn\u2019t exactly want to hear it and it hurt. I think we both could have gone about it in a better way but it ended up turning into an argument after she made a joke about it and I found myself feeling like my feelings weren\u2019t being respected or heard. I apologized for my end and tried to meet to work things out face to face but the feelings were not mutual so we have never really talked again.  I have sent a group text to both my littles when I dropped that explained that I dropped but even though I was no longer in the sorority I still will always be there for them if they want me to be there and that if they ever need anything to feel free to reach out to me.   \nAs it turns out both of them picked up littles the next year but my little (R, who I had an argument with) did her reveal earlier and didn\u2019t even tell her twin, my little (T). I honestly don\u2019t really care anymore, maybe wish I didn\u2019t spend all that money to be treated like I was completely negative and told that no one likes me because all I was, was negative when I was completely depressed, suicidal, and going through a complete existential crisis, but I felt bad for my little (T) because she didn\u2019t do anything to R.  \n I was invited to go to my little (T)\u2019s reveal later. Despite my personal problems with the sorority I was determined to follow through with my promise I made as a big, unfortunately they decided that they would have a new rule that didn\u2019t allow me to be there at the reveal or take pictures at all despite doing the same thing the year before, I don\u2019t want to make any assumptions, I didn\u2019t care, but I definitely felt bad for my little because they told her last minute and she didn\u2019t have anyone to film for her which was not fair to her. With that said, for some reason they decided to leave out a paper that was a formal request by my little R to have a pseudo big, E, who actually asked if me if she could take R off my hands if I didn\u2019t want her when I first picked up R and T. A pseudo big is when you are still new in the chapter and your big completely abandons you, usually sisters have informal pseudo bigs but when you formally request that means you don\u2019t want to be in that family anymore. Well so for some reason this paper was left out in the open and everyone saw it at the reveal while I was hiding in my little, T\u2019s room, so we could go out after the reveal. It took a lot of courage for me to go back and I really want to believe this was purely coincidence but it definitely felt intentional and manipulative especially considering that it was the same day that I happened to be there. It\u2019s unfortunate things ended up the way they have, because I stood up for her and defended her with a lot of things. I even got all of our names cleared before I dropped, not because I needed praise or recognition because I was doing what any good friend does, so I know that I wasn\u2019t a horrible big. I mean at least I still had a good relationship with my other little, right?",

    "postText": "So, let me start out this story by saying that I am fully supportive of trans people and the LGBTQ community. But I think our society has gotten to a point where some people are starting to take advantage of our acceptance and kindness, and it's fucking horrendous honestly.\n\nI dated my ex-gf from around Jun 2022 to Feb 2023 (we weren't official 'til Dec 2022). We were in the same friend group, but didn't spend a lot of time together 'til I moved to my own apartment when summer break started. Anyway, I knew she had a crush on me. I didn't have a crush on her, and when she confessed, I rejected her on the basis of my sexuality - as I'm a lesbian, and she was AMAB who had not spoken anything about questioning her identity whatsoever.\n\nWe stay close and fast forward a few days/weeks later, when we were discussing the topic of me liking girls, she says she \"doesn't even know what she is.\" And thus starts her period of questioning, followed by fully identifying as a trans girl. Note that, while I was super suspicious of the timing, she said that she's been confused about herself even before that, but the rejection is what brought it to surface and I don't doubt that. We're barely out of our adolescent years and it's a time when everyone is confused about themselves. I do think she genuinely had no ill intention.\n\nHowever... things that happened/were discussed/she said during the questioning period:\n\n* She identifies as a girl because, in her words, \"girls have it easier\".\n* She got uncomfortable with her voice when it started to pass as feminine (I was helping her do voice training)\n* She nearly convinced herself she has dysphoria, but quickly backed off when called out on the inconsistency as she'd never mentioned feeling dysphoric before; started identidying as a trans person w/ no dysphoria instead\n* She had to be convinced that people don't get surgeries for fun.\n* Was always focused on gender roles rather than gender identity (for example, me asking her if she'd rather be a feminine man or a masculine woman, and her going for the cis option)\n* Constantly talking about how she doesn't fit into the toxic masculinity stereotypes, and that's why she feels distanced from her assigned gender\n\nI don't think this needs an essay about every little detail of why the whole thing was skewed. It's there. It's obvious. I was hardcore supporting her throughout the entire process, but it got progressively more and more in-my-face how she's just... very obviously not trans. Her two gay dads said they were surprised when she came out, and she felt bad about it. She said if I'd said the same thing (which I thought about, just didn't say out loud) she would've backed off. She relies on people pampering her and catering to her identity without being critical of it, because if someone asks ANYTHING, she doesn't have the answers. Every discussion we had required mental gymnastics -type retrospective explanations, and she wants everyone to ignore everything that goes against her identity, so she can brush it off herself.\n\nThe fact that she's getting away with this makes me so angry, and I think the more deeper reasoning for that is that she's so clearly taking advantage of people's kindness and acceptance to feel like she has a place to belong to. She's lived in queer spaces throughout her childhood, and she wants to be special. She doesn't want to be \"that cis straight guy\". And I'm not going out of my way to call her out, and I'll still use her pronouns and new name (that she admittedly picked just to feel special) but having to deal with her has impacted my view on the trans community negatively, and I hate that. I don't want to be a hateful person. But maybe being unconditionally accepting and supportive is not always the best answer after all.",

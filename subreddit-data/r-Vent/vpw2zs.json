We're staying open because you obsessive capitalist freaks can't fathom not buying things for a few days out of the year. We're going to be here, tired and busy as shit because something about the 4th of July makes your brainwashed little mind want to show up at every store in fucking droves like cockroaches to a carcass. Most of us aren't doing anything because we're going to be so exhausted dealing with your stupid, annoying asses all weekend.",

Even the local convenience stores and gas stations closed on Christmas Day. We all knew ahead of time that that would be the case, so we planned ahead and had what we needed on hand.  Somehow all of us survived.\n\n I can understand the need for longer hours in today's Busy World but I think it would be nice if store employees could enjoy holidays in peace like the rest of us.",

Just because major fast food chains which have a constant demand of people who want to work there treat theirs like shit, doesn\u2019t mean every business does that, my parents cherish their employees, because along with a good work ethic, they don\u2019t have a constant supply of teenagers to replace people, unlike chains like McDonald\u2019s or KFC.",

Because if you won't work in these conditions for part time on minimum wage, there are 20 people lined up behind you that are desperate enough to earn any money they can get that will work under these conditions.\n\nWhen you get to retail, warehouse work and factory work etc, everyone is replaceable. Employers don't need to treat them nicely and since it costs employers money to treat employees nicely, they absolutely won't treat them nicely if they can get away with it. And that's what happens.\n\nInput other factors such as poor immigration regulation, poor education, inflation, low minimum wage, rubbish worker rights laws and so on. All of a sudden there are more and more people are desperate to earn money and employers have more and more replaceable staff. Which results in more people getting used by their employers.",

This is why absolutely no country on this planet does it, even if it is just some essential stores or pharmacies. As a matter of fact, just existing through covid should have showed you that, the economy PLUMMETED when businesses closed down. And to your point, people do deserve a break, and the majority of people get them, they are called \u201cdays off\u201d I don\u2019t know anyone that works 7 days every single week, except for some blue collar guys that actually take pride in that crap. Further, most businesses force employees to use their leave and work less hours to avoid having to pay them time and a 1/2 for overtime.",

They'll try absolutely everything except planing ahead and coming in earlier.\n\nIt brings me great joy pressing my panic button. Many of these people are passing through and have no idea the police are just down the street. Most of the time I get to watch the drunken idiots being interrogated on camera, still in the lot. Sometimes the police wait till they drive off so they can get 'em for drunk driving. Very satisfying.\n\nI believe in drinking responcibility despite my username. \ud83d\ude06",

People are more likely going to be celebrating how \"free\" your country is. But why would she want to celebrate a country, which prides itself on freedom and rights of their people, when hers and millions of other women's right to choose has been stolen from them? I for one will stand in solidarity for her as a Canadian woman. It's the same reason I stopped celebrating Canada day, I'm not going to celebrate a country that prides itself on \"ethnic inclusion\" that keeps sweeping the ongoing genocide of Indigenous people's under the rug. From residential schools, to the sixties scoop, to Missing and Murdered Indigenous women and children.",

It's a day meant to celebrate the first European colonists coming to Australia, but it's also the day in which the Indigenous people of Australia, despite being one of the oldest civilisations in history, lost the land they had been living on and caring for for tens of thousands of years. It was also the beginning of a centuries long attempt to commit genocide against the Indigenous people and exterminate their culture, involving discrimination that is still going on to this day. There is a debate among people about whether we should change the date of Australia Day and one of the most annoying methods people use to push it off is by saying that what happened was in the past and that we can't change it. It's annoying because even if that was true (which it isn't, there is so much we could do to make their situation better), the least we could do is not add insult to injury by celebrating a day which obviously still brings a lot of hurt judging by the number of protests that occur on that day.",

We literally had like 10% of usual guests, because everyone went away for Easter. But no. We have to be fucking open full time for that one guy that came in 10 minutes before closing to order some fries.   \n\n\nTo be clear. I weirdly enjoy working at food industry, and I work in this particular brand for about 8 years so it is hard decision to just go and change job.

They're never buying anything important, they're giving into their impulse to purchase something because they know we'll be open, and we'll only be open because the owners know how fucking dumb and predictable these simpletons are so they take advantage of it.

Resort to \"But I'm a victim with trauma\" to excuse their behaviour.\n\nI have trauma but I don't use it as an excuse to be a dick to others. Especially online.",

Play victim and hide behind their past trauma.\n\nBullies do this a lot when called out. Started going into victim mode and making out they are the real victims because they refuse to take accountability for their behaviour",

    "postText": "I just don't know anymore I've gone past the point of feeling sad for a long time and the new normal has just become feeling numb and unmotivated, I reach out to my so called friends and literally get ignored except for one or two I don't want to keep bugging about my shitty ass problems but what's the point? Can't get any decent friends irl because of the shitty drug town I'm living in where the only way to fit in is to deal coke or be a fucking snitch so what the fuck am I supposed to do? I can't get happy, nothing makes me happy, I'm so unmotivated and finished with everything that the second that something positive comes into my life it is almost instantly taken away from me, either I just have horrible luck or I was just made to suffer, I know it's best to fix your own problems but when you're on your own it's difficult, you had people in your life that you loved talking to everyday,hanging out with or playing games with and then they just up and ghost you, leaving you behind so the message is clear you're done okay fuck you C and F, I just wish I had something in my life that could give me a reason to keep trying or to motivate me, I can't even go to the gym anymore because of an arm injury, I don't know why I don't fit in anymore, I don't even know if I did something wrong, I just want a clear answer but I'm never going to get it and to that egotistical bitch that tries to flex her privileged wealth because she's an insecure snake that has everyone else wrapped around her finger go fuck yourself you piece of shit\n\nThat's all I guess, I have a lot more I wanted to say but... yeah, nothing works anymore",

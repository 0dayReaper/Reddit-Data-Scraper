    "postText": "TW: sex, childhood trauma, hard drugs, weed, alcohol, pedophilia, addiction, overdose  \nA while ago I broke up with my long term girlfriend , I mean the longest I've had at around 3 months. I can admit I have cared for her and I still do. Even while i try to convince myself i hate her from all my guts there hasn't passed a day I haven't thought about her.\n\n  \n The sad thing is we broke up 6 months ago around new year. I have an incredible amount of memories with her, She had been my first girlfriend at like 12. I'm now 19. In the school i go to i have no one I really like , I mean I hang out with two guys I can live with even if they are both stereotypical insecure teenagers. I mean she slowly became my only source of source of dopamine , I had became obsessed with her.\n\nII messaged her around the time I was having issues with my then girlfriend and literally planed out a date an hour after I broke up with my then girlfriend. I started smoking weed last summer and it really bothered her. I felt I had changed and that she wanted the version of me I had been before. I lost my own character just to be good enough for her. Every single time I tried being myself she would literally get mad at me. I don't even blame her , I knew she loved the version of myself I was pretending to be but I cared too much for her to accept it. I mean I'm not saying doing drugs changed me but it is a consequence of my character developing. \n\n  \nAnyways I internally felt that I wasn't worthy of love and that she was good for me because she was making me better. While I'm not saying Drugs were a good thing for me , I fully lost track of who i really was during that time and i don't even think I can be myself anymore. We broke up because of me. She said it was because she wanted to experience new things and that she felt like I was too clingy/obsessive/controlling  but I knew it wasn't fully about that.\n\n  \nShe had been molested by my friends father back in her childhood, It didn't escalate to the point of rape but It scarred her. Her mother was emotionally abusive and she left her home at 18 to go live with her father and grandma. She was fearful of physical touch and after she told me I think I tried my best not to be assertive. We had been talking about just being at my holiday place on new year and she talked about being embarrassing to be a virgin at 19 (I was 18 at the time) , me being as clueless as I was didn't really connect that statement with real life as I wasn't really ready for anything like that. A day or few before the new year she straight up sent me a reel literally saying \"We should fuck as soon as possible\". I had just had my first kiss that year. I bought condoms and after watching some Netflix Thing started to heat up until we were both naked and I couldn't get it up. I was literally shaking because of the stress. After that night things were awful, She left like a day before she was supposed to go going by some excuse and for the first time in like 6 years I balled my eyes out.\n\n   \nI just wasn't fucking ready and I should've told her that, but i couldn't bare to say no to a person I had been dreaming for even a long fucking make out session with. I feel so guilty in every way possible, I pushed her to do stuff with me and when she actually wished to do something I traumatized her.  \nI either saw trough her bullshit or imagined a person I liked and gave her her name. She always pretended to be something she wasn't and everything i ever wanted was for her to relax and be herself like she was on rare occasions. I loved her more when she was that way but that didn't mean I would have done anything for her even when she build her personality of of Pinterest posts. \n\n  \nI pushed her right into the protective shell I tried to get her out of after new year. \n\n  \nWhen she got drunk on her birthday and I was dead on amphetamine, weed and tequila she was siting on top of me and telling me how much she \"loved me\" and kissing me and I literally couldn't resist because of the drugs . And the next fucking day i messaged that girl how great that was, even when I knew she wasn't conformable with probably any of that sober. I had conditioned her into thinking she is only worth something to me doing stuff like that without even realizing . \n\n  \nI felt that there was this alternative version of her and I didn't bother to care about any of stuff she cared about , I was obsessive about this alternative her and I disregarded her actual character just like she did mine at the same time.\n\n  \nShe wanted a pause in the relation ship and I just broke it off because it hurt too much for my ego.   \nI still remember literally messaging her while drunk about \"not caring anymore\" \"not caring that she never loved the real me\" and how I going to do coke because of her \n\n  \nI eventually did try coke and almost died (another story) on a female friends birthday, It was stupid but I couldn't care less about my life at the time. I had been crying to that female friend and she invited me to her birthday like 50km away from my town in the countries capital and I did a lot of weed when she invited me into the bathroom with her friend. I had kind of a rebound crush on this girl. Her male friend pulled out a baggie and I asked what it is and like 2 minutes after that I was doing it ( I had already been high asf at that point ). For the entire time I was there I did like 10 lines. I don't want to get into the details but this guy was a known criminal and she dealt his the drugs he would get in incredibly large quantities and she could afford letting me use that shit for the cost of the bus ride there.  \n\n  \nAnyways after the birthday my life was going well and I was social a lot even if completely fake and covered in an egotistical facade when i hated myself in the inside. Every couple of days I wanted to turn my life around, It was like death twitches in the despair of depression , no matter how much I tried I couldn't dig myself out of my own hole.\n\n  \n I quit weed and all drugs then and relapsed like two times because of my self destructive behavior. Literally the only reason I even had a social life was because of a friend who left a general school for ours (don't know if i had mentioned but i go to a school that is literally all male) , when i wanted to quit again after I had relapsed for the first time that guy started insulting me telling me that he doesn't like lairs and that I'm lying to myself if I think I'm gonna quit , that it would be like him trying to quit cigarettes. \n\n  \nThis set me of even if he was partially right and I told him hes gonna be nothing just like his parents and he started threatening me that he was going to beat me up. I called him at like 4AM trying to resolve the situation and I told him I overstepped his boundaries and that I'm sorry. He in return just laughed and told me that he'll see me tomorrow.\n\n  \nThe next day at the break I asked him in front of all my friends if he was going threaten me and if he's do anything to me after school and he just replied \"maybe\" and I beat him up in front of the entire school in front of the gate in the rain to the point of him having puffy eyes. That day he told the school psychologist about it ( not in detail because we both would have gotten expelled ) and she called me in just to make both of us promise that this \"tiny argument\" wasn't going to repeat itself. \n\n  \nI lost all of my friend group, Now I have two/three friends in school and don't go out anymore.   \n\n\nI am now drug-free and got a job in programing for my neighbors company this summer and also a grocery store job but I still feel unworthy of affection and love and I don't know how to deal with it.   \nI hate everyone around me in school but the summer has started and hopefully I can become social again just for 3 months. I actually have a friend group in my holiday city. They are all addicted to weed but I don't really care  , I don't know , I might now be ready for a relationship but this vent really help me see that there is no reason i should hate who I am. I just fucking hate them all its not a me problem.",

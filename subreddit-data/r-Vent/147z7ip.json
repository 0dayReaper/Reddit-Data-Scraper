Until that day comes the only thing you\u2019ll really be able to do is \n\n1. Avoid him at all costs. If he enters a room you\u2019re in, leave.\n\n2. Try and stay at your friends houses and away from yours as much as possible.\n\n3. If he hits you tell your school counselor or the nurse at your school and by law they have to follow up on it. This will definitely scare the shit out of him enough to hopefully make him cut it out.",

Please know that you are loved by the people around you, like your friends and teachers. Is there any way you can distance yourself from Juan? Such as leaving the room when he enters. Btw, you aren't overreacting or being dramatic when you cry or feel about because of what he said, after all he is  a little sh!t. I hope he stops bullying/verbally abusing you, it's okay.",

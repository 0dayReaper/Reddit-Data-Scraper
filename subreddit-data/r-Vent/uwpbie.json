    "postText": "i hate receiving creepy DMs from men. \n\ni hate getting catcalled. \n\ni hate having to conform to beauty standards. \n\ni hate being afraid of walking alone in the evening. \n\ni hate the having the expectation of being \u201clady like\u201d. \n\ni hate double standards. \n\ni hate being seen as less than men. \n\ni hate having the expectation of having kids in the future. \n\ni could go on and on abt this.\n\n(no, i\u2019m not trans or anything. i love being a woman despite having to deal with these things constantly.)\n\nEDIT: so i\u2019m getting a lot of men in these replies trying to invalidate the things that ive personally experienced as well as countless other women. also the \u201cmen have it worse\u201d thing isn\u2019t necessary here. it\u2019s not a competition of which sex has more struggles in society. i never said that men don\u2019t deal with their own societal issues! this post is abt the struggles of women, NOT men! please stop trying to insert yourself into something that isn\u2019t relevant to you. make your own post if you\u2019d like to discuss your struggles as men.\n\nEDIT 2: ive noticed that in the men in the comments would rather debate women on this post rather than making their own post abt their struggles. it really shows that they only want to engage in arguments, otherwise they\u2019d freely talk abt their oppression on their own accts. why is it that men\u2019s oppression is often only brought up when a woman is talking abt her\u2019s?",

Unfortunately it\u2019s how human beings are wired to notice better looking things. I think for me because I started out later in life I wasn\u2019t resentful about having to put in the extra effort.  By then I had a great job, hobbies, financially savvy, putting on makeup and a stylish outfit together were just a few amongst the many things I was capable of doing.

I don't absolutely want to invalidate the things you said. I just want you to know that for the things people think you shouldn't care, if people expect you to have kids then screw them, if society wants you to join some beauty standards then screw it, I know it's difficult, but you have to be yourself, and I also think we have to act positively to change the world even with our only words, but this is another argument. Sadly, for the things people do to you like catcalling and creepy DMs there is really not much to do... This really breaks my heart, we should react and get mad but it's difficult and especially men can get violent and abusive in those situations, so it's really sad, I don't know how else I could express my feelings towards this... \nI hope I've not offended you in any way and I want you to know your feelings and struggles are totally valid. I'm not trans or else, I'm just a boy that always felt drawn to the female gender and that always felt sorry for all this atrocity that you have to live with.",

Not being under the impression that when a guy is nice to you, he wants to date you lol. You can focus on the good stuff at bad times like this. Now that the stereotypes and gender roles are not that solid, you can be more free. More options, even though It's slower in certain countries.

But if someone was saying that men don't have to be afraid whatsoever when walking down the street alone at night, they would be wrong.\n\n&gt;I haven't felt a single day where I was superior to anyone. I feel inferior, if anything.\n\n\nThere are certain advantages that men have compared to women though.\n\n&gt;Expectation of manliness, while I'm not that manly. There's always drawbacks. Grass is always greener on the other side.\n\nTrue, and you might think that it might be better to a woman overall, but really overall men have somewhat of a general advantage, if you get specific it gets more complicated though. If you want to be a housewife as a man, it'd be easier if you were a woman.",

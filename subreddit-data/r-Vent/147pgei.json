I realize it's a bad habit,  but its not something to get pissed off over,  let alone mess with your child's self esteem about it.  I mean, maybe think I over apologize because you get mad over things that don't need to be mad over???  \n Be h as ppy your kid us sympathetic and not an asshole like you \ud83d\ude21",

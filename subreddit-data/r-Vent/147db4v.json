    "postText": "i feel like the title is pretty self explanatory, but im gonna go deeper into it. Im not from america, we came from a third world country and my mom from her childhood had a really fucked up family which she jokes about now with her sister but for alot of it i cant even imagine going through half of what she did. She was rarely if ever allowed to use the tv, her mom screamed at her for every little thing, she was never allowed to go out and was under strict almost military like control her entire life. Thats not even the bad part, her getting married was super important and i guess it might have been a bit positive for her but she was married off at 18 to my dads family and got pregnant with my sibling a year later. It started off positive and everything was okay and her sister actually married my dads brother but everything went wrong from there on. My mom would constantly get berated and verbally abused by my dad and his side of the family, she wanted to pursue a college education but both her family and my dads family were strictly against it, she would get screamed at every time they caught her studying but she still enrolled in college and found ways to get a ride no matter what, whether it was travelling with sketchy men or her friends she made it to college and found a way to pay for it herself, and what stuck with me the most is she would only be able to study extremely late at night in her bathroom and would have to cover the bottom of the door with a towel so nobody would know all while being pregnant with my brother. She doesnt detail everything she went through and this is what i vaguely remember what she told me but she would constantly get verbally abused, shamed, made fun of by my dads family and many other things along with seeing my aunt (her younger sister) get abused so horribly by her husband that at one point he hit her across the face so hard blood was on the wall. i think that some light came into their lives when my aunt came to america and my mom and dad moved out and into our own house, but then we came to america though there were complications there too when my dads side of the family threatened to not let my mom go to america and that we would stay here but that didnt happen. From there on, my dad became a huge dick over time and there were more and more fights and at one point i saw my dad literally push a bed out of anger across a room at my mom, and over time their relationship deteriorated and in a couple if years thankfully now my aunt and mom have divorced their husbands. If you are still reading by now haha thanks for keeping up, so I know that all of this is probably insane and im trying to process it too but i have my own problems although many times i feel like they are miniscule compared to here. For one, she is extremely religious along with my sibling they are both muslim and very very homophobic to the point where they told me gay people do not exist. Well, surprise surprise I am gay and that shit has fucked me up for the longest time waking up every day knowing that their love is most likely conditional and that they would kick me out if they knew what i really am, ans I have grown up knowing this since i was about 9 or 10. Consequently, I am a detached person from them and it feels hard to really accept and feel loved by them. I was also sexually assaulted by my ex best friend as I detailed in another post a while ago and that took a heavy toll on my mental health and I am still working through the pain. I am a huge burnout and am no longer as smart as I used to be and feel like a failure alot of times, and get pissed off because of how strict my mom is saying that I can\u2019t see my friends more than two weeks in a row and she doesn\u2019t understand that I need to heal too, and that whenever I do not see my friends i enter a hole of depression where I am constantly reminded of what my friend did. She says that I can\u2019t see my friends so I can keep my grades up which is utter bullshit and pisses me off so much, I am never allowed to go out other than maybe once or twice a month and at times am left feeling like a social reject and wonder how much different my life would be if I could go to parties or even hang out with my friends rather than be a forced shut in. I can\u2019t get the grades she wants me to get and just feel like a failure overall at times and fell into substances a while back to just not think about any of this bullshit but I just feel like my problems are dumb and literally nothing compared to what she went through and it leaves me feeling even worse. I don\u2019t know what people will say to all of this but honestly its nice to get it out and ill read whatever you guys say.",

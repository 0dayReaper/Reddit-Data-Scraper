    "postText": "Hi anyone reading this I really hate how people assume I shouldn't be alone with my niece because I'm a guy.\n\nToday is a hot day so I took my niece to the park after getting her favorite ice cream cone for doing great in school this week and for the fact she likes to learn.\n\nSo at the park she's running around having fun I can't chase her like I use to( bad back).there is a couple of lady's on the other side watching me as I am relaxing and one walked over to me.\n\nShe asked if she's mine I said no she's my niece.\nThe woman had a disgusted expression and asked does her mom know she's does why the hell wouldn't she. The woman said afterwards men like you shouldn't be let alone with kids. I told her and nut jobs like you shouldn't have any she looked surprised and stomped back to her friends when one started either picturing or video taping me while one was on the phone.\n\n it I chose to just get my niece and take her to the book store so she can read some books and I can find some nice recipes to cook with her anf my wife.\n\nWhy can't I just enjoy a day in peace it was such a nice day too.\n\nEdited to add.\n\nHi thanks for all the support I gotten from a couple peoples comments that there seems to be something missing but this is all I can think of I truly don't know why she did this and I don't know if a did something that might have triggered her.\n\nAlso I spend a lot of time with my niece because she's dealing with a rough home custody issues and not to mention the fact her half siblings get special treatment.\n\nI do these things with my niece because her parents haven't been paying attention to her work in school or her efforts in the extra curriculums she's been doing not to mention the fact she doesn't feel welcomed at home.\nShe's a very smart kid her teachers believe she might even be able to jump a grade I want her to feel rewarded for her works and good behavior and she really loves this unicorn Sunday cone it taste like overly sweet cotton candy I prefer mint",

I'm taking her to the Franklin museum this June so she can have fun learning she's been keeping her grades as A's and B's for a 9 year old she's smart as a whip. My wife thinks of she keeps going she'll be a better chef then any of us.\n\nAnd odd question are you a potter fan because of you name",

Ignore those Karens, they're probably angry their children don't have someone like you in their lives.

                    "comment": "Dude\u2026I have no clue why, but A LOT of moms at the park are absolutely batshit CRAZY\u2026I don\u2019t understand it, but they\u2019re seriously some of the most insanely *out of line* people I\u2019ve ever met in my life. \n\nI (23F) was at the park with my old senior chihuahua one early morning, during some of her last days..and decided I\u2019d like to use the swing-set for a bit to sway on with my pup on my lap. It was like 8am, and there were only maybe 3 or 4 moms/babysitters at the playground watching their toddlers, or pushing their babies in the stroller around the sidewalk. The park was pretty much completely empty. \n\nThis particular swing set was pretty disconnected from the kids playground, maybe 50+ feet away, and also had adult-friendly sized chairs to swing on. Besides the swing I was using, there\u2019s was one other adult chair swing, and separated from those there were 4 of those toddler swings. Not one person/kid was using any of them, nor were there any people or kids within even 50ft of me lol. I was simply just swinging with my pup in my lap and enjoying the morning breeze in solitude. \n\nUntil suddenly a very pissed off Karen approached closer towards me, and angrily sat herself about 20 ft. away from me, just staring me down and giving super dirty looks. I wasn\u2019t understanding why she was giving me dirty looks, I thought maybe she was upset that I had my chihuahua on my lap, but honestly wasn\u2019t sure so I just continued on innocently swinging, and ignored her. \n\nShe then marched over to me with her baby and stroller like an absolute mad woman, and just stood a few feet in front of me shaking her head. She was huffing n puffing, giving dirty looks then actually pulled her phone out to start recording\u2026 without ever saying 1 actual word to me up to this point. \n\nI asked if there was some issue I wasn\u2019t aware of? To which she said YES. In fact. there\u2019s a HUGE problem. Apparently her toddlers (that were nowhere even in sight) wanted to use these 2 specific swings. That I\u2019m not even supposed to swing because I\u2019m a full grown adult, and this park is for children *only*!! She claimed I shouldn\u2019t even be anywhere *near* the swing set or playground unless I had a child, then continued to make insane insinuations that I was a pedophile.! ! I honestly couldn\u2019t believe the things I was hearing. \n\nI told her she sounds absolutely ridiculous. I\u2019ve never heard of any such rules, nor were there any rules like this posted anywhere. And that the swings are for *everyone* to share. \n\nThese specific swings were literally built for adults/and even handicapped persons to be able to swing on. Toddlers wouldn\u2019t even be able to use them by themselves, and at that point why wouldn\u2019t you just use the swings specifically made for toddlers? Lol. \n\nShe told me that I need to go talk to the \u201cpark director\u201d. (I\u2019m still not sure who she was even referring to). I told her you are literally the only one here who seems to have a problem, why don\u2019t *you* go talk to this \u201cpark director\u201d lol. \n\nI kindly told her if your kids wanted to use the swings, all they or *you* had to do was ask nicely. Mind you, I hadn\u2019t seen any kids approach the swings or even appear to want to use them, otherwise I would\u2019ve gladly moved. Honestly, I don\u2019t think she even *had* kids old enough to swing. It seemed she was only their with a very small baby, and apparently was only there looking for a fight. \n\nShe was seriously trying to  *force* me off the swings through harassment and abusive language. I said niiiice. This is really nice behavior at a apparent children\u2019s only park. If anyone here should leave it\u2019s you. You must be a grrreat role model! I plainly stated, if your kids, who are nowhere to even to be seen, want to use the swings, ..they can come up and nicely ask me. Period. Otherwise I\u2019m staying put. Sorry! \n\nShe kept recording and said she was gonna post this to Facebook and that I\u2019d regret it. I said okkkaaay lady, that\u2019s ok with me. I\u2019m doing nothing wrong, you\u2019re acting extremely entitled and out of line. Then started to loudly cuss me out, made her smoll baby start crying, looked back at ME and said \u201cnow look what you\u2019ve done!!!\u201d and walked back over to another parent and started talking and pointing back at me, like I was some danger or threat to their children. Lol. \n\nI was completely flabbergasted. And as stupid as it sounds, has made me never want to touch the stupid swing set ever again, or even walk past the playground, lmao. Moms be seriously *WILDIN* yo.",

They think everyone is a pedo predator because it's not too common to see a good man out with his daughter, neice, or little sister, but they are out there. \n\nI work at a grocery store and a large chain big box store and I see father's or men with little girls all the time and my first thought is how loved and cared for those little girls must feel. I think it's so sweet.\n\nMy husband LOVES and spoils our granddaughter. We are young grandparents (44 and 46), and she is 2. I hope no stupid person comes and tries him because they will get the shock of their lives. \n\nAnyway, I feel like you handled it very well\n I used to hang out with my favorite uncle all the time. Don't allow stupid, sick minded people get to you..",

Yet they treats the half siblings on both sides more special than they do to her so she feels left out a lot. Me my mother and father pay for her dance class extracurricular sports and tried to get her into some girl scouts groups so she never felt left out of things.\n\nThe poor thing doesn't even trust her own parents and she's only turning 9 years old soon anytime she's having a hard time she talks to me and lately when she's having girl issues she's been talking to my wife which her mom does not like.\n\nMy brother her father isn't happy I don't spoil my nephew as much but he's only three and thinks I should spend as much time or to take my nephew on special trips without my niece to make him feel special. Yeah my brother would treat his son with more attention then his own daughter. But what drives me up the wall is the fact that she dreams to be a chef like me but he wants her to be a mechanic like him but doesn't put in the same effort I do to teach her he wants her to have the interest in learning from him without the effort",

Honestly, the only advice I have is just accept that was a shitty person and be happy you stood up for yourself. I\u2019d be heart broken if someone said this to me and my niece heard. I don\u2019t want that memory to be stuck with her. She\u2019s 4yo now, but I really want to make sure I\u2019m still active in her life when she\u2019s in middle school or high school.

In our case it comes from a place of homophobia too, but either way whatever the circumstances may be it\u2019s a disgusting assumption to make about a person honestly.

It's very harmful and I'm glad you stood your ground! My mom could have taken notes from you, she took the passive approach which lead to more harassment. My mom said that those women only pick on other's because they're unhappy with their life. Think of the movie mean girls, it's like that except with grown adult women who have zero empathy. It's such a weird group of people to find out in the wild like that. You didn't do anything wrong, those women are predatory with their motives. You did the right thing by telling her off! You belonged there with your niece and they had no right to use you as target practice.",

    "postText": "TW mention of transphobia/homophobia \n\nHas anyone else noticed that comment sections online (mainly instagram, but im sure it happens on apps like tiktok, too) have been full of transphobic and homophobic bigotry?\n\nIt's pride month and every video/post I see about pride has multiple comments with up to 5k likes spewing hateful anti-lgbtq+ rhetoric. It is mentally draining to see this level of hatred towards me and my community every day. I try to just ignore it or not even check the comments, but sometimes I when want to post a supportive comment, I am faced with hundreds of people saying horrible things,  and making excuses for their hate. Adults and teenagers alike. It is really sad to think that there are so many people out there with so much hate in their heart.\ud83d\udc94  \n\nI even tried reporting some of these people for hate speech and bullying, but according to instagram, none of it is actually hate speech.  Its weird, when i comment that they have an ugly heart and personality, my comment gets removed instantly!  I just don't understand. And I don't enjoy social media anymore. I wish people had more love and compassion for their fellow human beings. :(",

            "comment": "I honestly just searched homophobia so I could talk about this lol. My city which is pretty liberal but has very conservative outer rural ring, has had a bunch of SUPER HOMOPHOBIC AND TRANSPHOBIC shit happen this week. People spray painted a rainbow crosswalk black. They had a protest about trans kids and there was a woman teaching her kid to jump on the pride flag. The shawarma place put up a sign complaining that gays in the 90s didn't force it on everyone else or something stupid like that. My friend is a teacher in a community that's mostly immigrants and the kids like boycotted school and half of them didn't show up. \n\nIt's so fucked up and upsetting. \n\nI also really think that the people at the top of capitalism benefit from this. Like Elon Musk dropped a million dollars into Canada's convoy. Why??? If everyone is looking at all this right wing bullshit that's horrifying, then they can keep making laws that help them making money, they can ignore climate change if the left is all upset about the homophobia. Who owns social media companies? Surely those folks have money to be made by conservative governments. It's not a neutral platform. \n\nYou can tell because if you delete tiktok and reinstall it, the first like 10 videos will always be AGGRESSIVE right wing messages. Once I couldn't look away and then the algorithm thought I was a trump supporter and it got worse and worse. Why the fuck is tiktoks default first 10 videos hardcore right wing views?? Everytime I delete the app?? Unless there's money to be made in brainwashing vulnerable people into believing their enemy is each other rather than the corporations and the capitalist government policies.",

Also, I don't even live in America,  and 90 percent of the content I see is centred around American issues/politics.",

I've also noticed it irl, straight people will mention us out of the blue just to say how much they hate \"THOSE MEN PRETENDING TO BE WOMEN\"\n\nIdk where the obsession came from but ik among my family and gen x's in my life its really bad. Even with some kids that were at my school. We'll just be hanging out and then a guy decides to debate on if puberty blockers are ethical. \n\nI feel like were at a strange time where i wish that we weren't as well known. So we could just live, and people didn't have a whole picture of gay people from Propaganda they see instead of just speaking to people.\n\nI'm in florida,and i grew up thinking that my friends and I would be able to be happily out and open with ourselves and everyone in college. I have no idea what's gonna happen when i start this fall.\n\nIk i vented a bit here too just i feel you",

They literally just mald about queer people all day and crawl out of the woodwork like a bunch of roaches to spew their hateful shit.  Honestly, they're worse than roaches --- at least roaches can't help that they're roaches. \n\nBut I agree with the other poster --- you're probs gonna get a swarm of TERFs in your DMs, replying to your old comments, sending you Reddit Cares and shit lol.",

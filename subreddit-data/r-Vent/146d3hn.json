            "comment": "Nooo I\u2019m so sorry that happened. Guys don\u2019t understand a lot about women sexually and they don\u2019t ever seem to care enough to educate themselves. \n\nUnless you have medical issues, or you\u2019re on meds that make you dry or decrease your libido, you shouldn\u2019t have any problems getting aroused. If you were really interested in this guy you probably wouldn\u2019t have had any issues. It sounds like you didn\u2019t really want it but agreed :( don\u2019t feel like you have to do anything to appease anyone \n\nAnother thing guys are clueless about is hygiene. You just can\u2019t go back and forth between the vagina and the butt. It\u2019s like cross contamination. You could get an infection. Anything that\u2019s been in your butt needs to be thoroughly cleaned before going into your vagina. Even with a condom on!!!!\n\nBaby oil is NOT a safe lubricant. This could also lead to you getting an infection. \n\nThis definitely doesn\u2019t sound  consensual if you were screaming for him to stop and he didn\u2019t. Even if he did initially begin the encounter with your permission, you have the right at any time to ask him to stop. You don\u2019t owe him anything. Even if he buys you dinner. Even if he complains you\u2019ll give him blue balls. You don\u2019t owe them anything. I\u2019m so so sorry you had to experience that. It might honestly be best to talk about this with a counselor or therapist, or at least someone in person that you trust. If you feel like you\u2019re up for that.",

Some of what you\u2019ve written here could get you some unwanted attention or even harassment, specifically if you\u2019re underage and make that known too. Maybe don\u2019t talk about how tight you are. I get it was for context but you may be feeding into some creeps fantasy, especially with talking about SA. Be careful out there.",

The only thing I look forward to is masturbating every night, I think about it all the time and when I\u2019m home alone I do 3 to 6 times a day\u2026\n\nThe thing is I really want to have sex but I\u2019m really insecure about my body and don\u2019t want anyone to see me naked but I wish it wouldn\u2019t be like that because I think about it all day and it horrible. I can\u2019t concentrate or think about anything else most of the time because of how horny I am. It\u2019s fucking horrible to never be actually released of this constant feeling!!",

Maybe that can be one thing to discuss with your current therapist.

We shouldn't feel guilty about our sex drives! They naturally flux through our lives. There's been times where I haven't been able to go to bed without masturbating, and other times where I can go weeks without it. Being on artificial hormones made me realize how hormone based our sex drives are. Whenever I've just had my shot I get super horny for a few weeks, and then towards the end I have no sex drive at all basically. You're still a teenager, you'll calm down eventually, and even if you don't there's nothing wrong with it! I think you might be feeling especially ashamed because you're female, and most women in media are portrayed as super timid and not wanting sex at all, and that's not true for everyone. It doesn't make you a slut to have desires, or even to act on them. That's some weird notion society wants to push. Purity is so fucking weird as a concept. \n\nAs for the other thing, sex is totally overrated. Masturbation can be just as fun! I understand you want to have sex really bad, and I don't judge you for that, but I want you to take your time and really find the right person. People act like having sex is so much better than doing stuff alone, and it's just not true. They're two different things, and can't really be fairly compared like that. I hope you find confidence soon!",

It's what our body needs. However, it would be better if we decide when it's right time for it and how much time we should give it. Control should be in our hands. We can't let that happen. \n\n\nMost of the time it's atmosphere. When you are alone, stressed and probably can't do something productive due to some reasons. This situation make it difficult to not do it..But try not to completely surrender to your urges. It may steal your inspiration and willingness to do other things..\n\n\nActual problem starts when we completely ignore other aspects of life. It's not like you are suppressing it. Add those positive activities to your routine. It will help you balance. You may fail multiple times but keep going. Accept it, embrace it and keep trying..\n\nSometimes when we are in right atmosphere, having quality time, urges don't bother. Because we are occupied doing much better things.. Going on an adventure, spending time in nature early morning. \n\n\nOne thing I understood about these urges is it's never enough. Something that you really enjoy now, will be less entertaining after sometime. You'll need to find something else. The more time and energy you give it, the more control it has on you. Try to get out of slowly. Step by step. It's a difficult time for you to control it but it's ruining your peace of mind. So it's crucial to take control.\n\n\n\n\nIf any of these doesn't work for you, don't be hopeless. I'm believe you can always find your way. All the best!",

I would look into \"hypersexuality\" just in case thats what's happening, cuz ik for me its a sign i'm entering hypomania. \ud83e\udd37 so u can avoid talking in detail and just tell the therapist ur experiencing hyposexuality along with any traits i've noticed. or tell them u think ur addicted. cuz then they can give u tips on behavioral interventions :) good luck and remember there's no shame in talking about that stuff with a mental health professional.",

If it happens for boys I imagine it can just as much happen for girls. I guess I\u2019ll give the same advice which is to try and focus that energy somewhere else and try to exercise restraint.\n\nThe struggling with body image though again I can somewhat understand as a still skinny adult guy who still feels insecure about my body sometimes, as I\u2019m skinny to the point where it\u2019s doesn\u2019t look good on a guy to be that skinny at my age.\n\nPerhaps working out might be good to distract yourself and also be healthier? Try to find a hobby or skill that you think you are good at and immerse yourself in it. It will give you something to feel good about and focus on your insecurities at the same time",

Most people who are bipolar have 1 thing that they fixate on, and for a large number of bipolar people I know it's sex. If you've been diagnosed with bipolar it would be worth talking to your therapist. If he is a good therapist, he won't think anything bad about what you are saying, and I can assure you that you are not the only patient he sees with symptoms like this. Is this something recent, or has it been going on for a while?",

I think that's just being young. \n\nNow I just look back and laugh. \n\nBuy some sex toys off Ali Express and go wild. I would recommend using hands too so you don't get desensitised. Sex toys during sex is also phenomenal. \n\nDont beat yourself up \ud83d\udc95",

It could help with both these issues somewhat.\n\nIt's a way to get out pent up energy and can help build confidence with you.\n\nWhen I was 19 I was the same way. It is all I thought about. The gym did bring some relief. The only issue was when I cut out the bad food, lost some weight and started feeling more confident it made me hornier sometimes because all my hormones and bodily functions were working better. This really only happened when I needed rest days or was taking it easy from light injury.\n\nIdk, just a thought and recommendation",

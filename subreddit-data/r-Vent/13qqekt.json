I\u2019m so tired of black people pulling the whole \u201cIts because I\u2019m black!\u201d Response out of their ass when they get called out on doing something shitty.\n\n\nRecently there was a video of a black guy going around Walmart with a gas tank in his grocery cart pretending like he took it out of an elderly woman\u2019s car. She became upset and the scene started and ended up with a man telling the guy to get out of the store and that he\u2019s acting suspicious (or something like that) and the guy goes \u201cWhY beCausE I\u2019m BLAAAACK!!!\u201d\n\nThat shit pissed me off so fucking much. \n\nThen there\u2019s that other lil fucking twat burger in the UK terrorizing people, trespassing and taking a woman\u2019s fucking dog. Guess what he says \u201cIts because I\u2019m a black male doing these things\u201d bro shut the fuck up. You\u2019re being an antagonistic buffalo scrotum. It has nothing to do with you being black.\n\n\nAs a black person\u2026.\n\n\nI\u2019m tired of hearing this shit!",

One day I said fuck her and she found out, and eventually management fired me for racist harassment just because she was black.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, I did apologize and avoided interactions if I could help it with the other person, but still yet that was the biggest reason they got rid of me",

My thinking was yes you have these conditions but you learn to adapt, you learn how to deal with this and make the most of it in those situations. \n\nI also feel the same way about people that treat people like shit because \"oh I don't feel good\" or \"I'm just tired\". There's never an excuse to treat somebody poorly, unless of course they deserve it lol, But you're actions shouldn't be dictated by things like disability or race or gender or whatever else people find excuses for.",

The trans woman was black, the transsexual was white and was the first to go through conversion therapy and surgery 30+ years ago. The trans woman kept bringing up race whenever caught in a lie or asked something she felt was triggering.\n\nFor example: she was asked about bathroom segregation and whether those who identify as trans women should be able to use women's restrooms and facilities, even if they haven't done any work to appear like a woman (surgery, hormones, etc. Basically just a man saying he's a woman, but still with a dick and beard). The transsexual said they should not be allowed, because he knows how it feels to be a natural/biological woman and knows it's not safe and opens the door to predators. The trans woman brought up race and kept emphasizing \"as a BLACK trans woman...\". She doesn't want to go through surgery, so I'm guessing she felt \"attacked\" and just ran to the race card \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude44\n\nIf I went around starting every question or statement with \"as a Mexican American woman...\" people would get annoyed pretty fast; same with the race card and it's overuse by many in the black community. Unfortunately, I've also seen many black people get berated by other black people for \"acting white\".",

He leaned over me and said I didn't like him because he was black, and tried to get the other nurses to agree that I was racist.  I pointed out that the other psychologist is not white, like even in the slightest, and I'm begging to talk to her, and I think i finally got him to have a moment of speechlessness when i said \"it's not because you're black, it's because you're a fucking asshole\".  \n\nI finally got to see the psychologist I felt comfortable with and made better progress lol. But because of the place i was in in my head I did think I might be racist.  The other psych was so pissed that now on top of everything I was having an existential crisis about that lol (not at me, at him)\n\nEdit: by mean I had started saying \"I need a competent psychologist\" when requesting the other person.

Look at the comments! \n\nFor clarity: I\u2019m pretty sure he was the one who admitted to pretending to be a White gay man online because the other guys on Grindr didn\u2019t want anything to do with Black males\u2026..then he turns around and posted this BS! Some folks are just confused AF with racial self hatred and need to be called out! \ud83d\ude0e",

            "comment": "Not too long ago I was in a clothing store. While trying to go into the dressing room, a large black family blocked the hall way. They were all speaking so loudly that I couldn\u2019t talk enough nor was my just standing there enough to get them to realize I needed to get through. I went to the cashier and kindly asked her if she could help me get in. She does just that and when I go to enter the dressing room area, they start shouting in my direction things like, \u201dOh, we can\u2019t stand here Bc we\u2019re Black,\u201d \"It\u2019s that white bitch that said something,\u201d \u201dThey racist.\u201d Even exiting the rooms my husband and I essentially had to push through to get out. After the moment I realized what I think is the problem at least 75% of the time. These people are so out of touch with reality and common courtesy of others than they can\u2019t possibly fathom that they are doing anything wrong so it\u2019s easy for them just to chalk it all up to racism. Now, there\u2019s obviously people who use it to validate their behavior but I definitely think this takes some of the cake here. To make another point, Racism wasn\u2019t really as big of an issue before Biden was our president and that\u2019s coming from someone who didn\u2019t particularly care for either side. We have to stop letting the media control us and make ourselves aware of people around us with basic respect.",

    "postText": "I have no fucking idea what's going on. There's been these 2 girls that I've really *really* fallen for, especially the second one. Both have shown the same amount of interest in me, but both of them decided to go with other people. The first one can kinda go fuck herself since she tried to ghost me. The second one at least had the decentcy to tell me, and doesn't know how the relationship will go, so I'm kinda in the back pocket. And man, this second girl, (let's call her Bailie) was awesome. Bailie has never seen anything from Star Wars (not so much as clips), had no clue what a WiiU was, but was still willing to learn and took really heavy interest in the nerdy stuff I was in to. Not only that, we really matched up with our sexual preferences, and we're willing to try new things with each other once I moved closer (I'm moving across the country at the end of July). And man, the connection was fucking strong, even only after a week! And we both agreed that it was probably the best week we've both had in a while. And FUCK this hurts. I know it's only been a week, and I shouldn't have been so attached, but man, when the connections there's the connections there. And I don't blame her reasoning for going with the other person. Being that he's closer (even after I move), there might(?) be some history behind them already, and how he makes her feel in person. And as much as I want her to be happy, and I want no ill-will towards her or the relationship, in the back of my mind, I want it to fail. I want it to fail so badly. I want it to crash and burn. I almost want her to realize she chose the wrong person. I almost want an \"I told you so\" kind of thing. But it's just the thoughts that swim in my head. And it's very much a \"I do (want that to happen) and I don't (want that to happen)\" type thing. I do, because I want to be with her so fucking badly, but I don't because I just want her to be happy. But I think the world just hates me being happy. And just wants to fuck me over left and fucking right. I'm tired. I'm happy by myself, I am, but I want someone to be happy with, ya know? I just don't understand why that's so hard for the universe to give me.",

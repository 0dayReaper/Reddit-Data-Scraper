Not even once.You can say you don\u2019t understand a perspective. You can say you disagree with a perspective. But when you say \u201cYour perspective doesn\u2019t even deserve to be acknowledged and you just need to discard it like a piece of overchewed gum\u201d\u2026 that\u2019s when people get angry.\n\nThat\u2019s when people rage.

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for 10 years. Obviously people change over time and what not, but I\u2019m just so confused. We haven\u2019t had sex in years. I\u2019ve tried talking with him about it but he sort of just says a few agreements to pacify me and nothing changes. I used to be underweight from issues I don\u2019t want to talk about. After we started dating he helped me recover and I have gained weight but I\u2019m by no means overweight. We stopped having sex due to my tokophobia. After having sterilization my fear has been resolved but he still isn\u2019t the least bit interested in me in that way. I can\u2019t help but think I\u2019m unattractive and want to relapse.",

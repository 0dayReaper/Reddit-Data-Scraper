    "postText": "There's a coworker who I found out has 'godself' pronouns. This coworker identifies as nonbinary and prefers the pronouns 'god' and 'godself'. This person explained it as a 'xeno gender' called 'godgender'. This person gets very furious if someone doesn't use them, such as when people are talking about this coworker amongst themselves. ...\n\nI'm just going to come out and say it.. this makes me feel really uncomfortable. I'm muslim (moved to the United States a year ago) so it just feels wrong to me to call a human being a god....\n\nAt the same time, I've heard that transgender politics are a minefield right now in the United States. I even heard that you could lose your job for refusing to use someone's pronouns. I'm not sure if that's true or not, so I'm not sure what to do... I don't want to make enemies here, I'm just saying it makes me feel really uncomfortable...",

They/them is also not a pronoun, as it implies there are multiple people in one body (schizophrenia not withstanding). Pronouns are simply he or she. He/she were literally brought into the language to shorten sentences referring to someone, as opposed to using their full name. For example:\n\n\u201cAlexander has a really good job. Because of this, Alexander can afford a really nice house. Alexander lives in Beverly Hills. Alexander is someone I look up to\u2026\u201d and so on. We use \u201che\u201d in place of his name, because it saves time (which humans have an understanding of as being finite, therefore we love to save even seconds) and generally improves the flow of speech.\n\nAny other pronouns that aren\u2019t he or she are not technically proper pronouns for a person. Other pronouns are not really pronouns, but rather preferences- and they have a right to prefer those particular pronouns- but we are hardwired to see him/her and must be told specifically to use other pronouns. They\u2019re made up, because even generations down the road after the gender identity debate has been generally accepted the world around, no person\u2019s eyes are going to see someone who looks at a man/woman and connect them to the the pronouns xey/xem or god. They will still see he or she, or collectively as a group, them.",

There's also \"I\", \"you\", \"it\" \"we\" and \"they\". \n\nAlso, if you're that bothered about referring to a single person as \"they\", consider this: \"you\" was originally only used when referring to multiple people and \"thou\" was the singular form, but it fell out of fashion so now we use \"you\" for both singular and plural. A similar thing is now happening where \"they\" is used as an alternative to \"he/she\", either when the gender is unknown or if the person in question doesn't identify as either male or female. \n\nI also used to think that singular \"they\" was weird, but I've now gotten used to it and I think it's a better alternative than inventing a bunch of new pronouns",

I can see how it could make you uncomfortable considering your religion. I wish I had more to say other than asking them if they use any other pronouns. I respect you for doing what you can to not make them feel uncomfortable but I really hope there could be some sort of middle ground. Good luck, bro.",

            "comment": "Hello! Non-binary person here (he/they) and here are my thoughts. \n\nI think you should approach this person and ask for any auxiliary pronouns. What this means is if they have a set of pronouns that they feel comfortable using that\u2019s not their main set, such as gods/godsself. Xenogenders are a thing that I admit I don\u2019t entirely understand, but almost everyone I\u2019ve met with a xenogender has a set of auxiliary pronouns. \n\nIf this person asks why, explain that you don\u2019t feel comfortable because of conflicting views with your religion. If they\u2019re not going to give you other pronouns, it\u2019s safest to default to they/them. But what happens after this point is not your fault. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m going to get downvoted for this response, but I genuinely feel like it\u2019s the best way to keep you safe from anyone claiming you\u2019re transphobic, as well as keep the air at work at least semi-comfortable. I understand that not everyone wants to use they/them for me, so I\u2019ll ask them to use he/him. It\u2019s worked as a decent compromise in the past in my personal experience, and I hope it works for you. \n\nBest of luck, OP &lt;3 I hope you\u2019re having a wonderful 2022!",

For example it/itself goes against my belief that humans are not objects. I would not use god/godself because titles that indicate status are against my beliefs. For example, doctor, sir, ma'am, professor, your honor, your majesty. I only use titles with someone who I personally feel is above me, for example, my sensei at my martial arts dojo, he's earned the right to ask for a title from me. \n\nI also wouldn't call someone a slur like bitch/bitchself. Or nazi/naziself. \n\nI'm fine with neopronouns, but not every word can be divorced from an extremely negative context.",

That \u201cpronoun\u201d is very disrespectful.  As much as they want that to be their \u201cpronoun\u201d, I absolutely would NOT use it because of my own personal devotion to God.",

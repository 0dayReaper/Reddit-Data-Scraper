    "postText": "Now for the long version. Hi I\u2019m Matthew and I\u2019m 27M. My life is a fucking joke. Let me explain. I have no self image thanks to past relationships (I\u2019ll explain in a moment) that person left me with a destroyed self image, me feeling worthless every second of every day, and me hating myself and thinking everyone hates me. \n\nI have been dealt a shitty hand by life. Some of it being my own fault. Pretty much I\u2019m all alone. My friends always have been better than me. They were the first to get their license, first to get gfs, first to have fianc\u00e9s, first to move out, and one is married with me other friend not far behind. I feel like a fucking failure. I have no gf, and I haven\u2019t moved out. I don\u2019t have a high school diploma because I was pulled out of school by my parents and my parents weren\u2019t financially stable enough to get me a proper education through homeschooling. Hell my friends mom even PAID to get me some adult schooling but I was a fucking idiot and didn\u2019t go. \n\nAll my relationships have been online except one but I couldn\u2019t even count the irl one because technically it wasn\u2019t a bf and gf thing but more like kissing buddies. I\u2019m antisocial and have severe social anxiety. I can\u2019t even hold a conversation with someone unless I\u2019m in a work setting so that\u2019s a no go on getting a gf\n\nI just feel fucking worthless",

    "postText": "Im done.\n\nHello. Im 18 and have many problems. When I was in middle school, I had a reputation of lying. Over and over about serious thinfs- ie; smoking and rape. When push came to shove all the things I lied about happened to me. Me and my girlfriend have been going through a rough patch, all we can do is talk about and have sex. We're not what we used to be. On top of that, my ex boyfriend (whom raped me.) Is now one of her closest friends, and I'm pretty sure he's telling her terrie things about me.\n\n   On top of all of this. I might be pregnant. And I don't wanna get an abortion at all. My parents have told me since I was 14 that I would end up a dropout and pregnant. It hurts knowing that they're right. And if I am, they're going to kick me out of the house. I don't have the assets to raise a child by myself. (For context, my girlfriend is biologically male- and we have no access to condoms. We use the pullout method.) I don't know what to do. I've tried so hard to make things right with my family but I just can't. I'm to the point where I don't wanna be here anymore. If my own family doesn't want me, who does? I just really need some support. This is my final hope. Thank you for listening.",

Now I am a little bitch and I feel it makes me weak and an easy target. \nMy husband and I have been having a rough time with our marriage. He's done some shit. I chose to forgive him but I didn't get the closure I wanted. I want to talk and be open. I cry because I am going through so much and feel alone. I get no reaction from him and it freaking drives me crazy.",

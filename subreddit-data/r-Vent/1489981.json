    "postText": "My English teacher also works as one of my year level\u2019s head teachers (of sorts) and last Friday I (apparently) swore at my work related skills teacher (who has it out for me), when my mum asked about it when I got home, I denied every swearing at that teacher, because I hadn\u2019t, and my mum knows I\u2019ll tell her what happened, whether I was in the wrong or not, I\u2019ll come home and tell mum, \u201cyou might get a call from Mrs _______, I called (different teacher) a ducking cunt\u201d or whatnot, I\u2019ll tell mum how it went. Well I didn\u2019t swear and mum was told just to keep me home Tuesday (Monday was public holiday) so mrs W could talk to witnesses about it. Well the only people who would have heard the conversation I have with (let\u2019s say) Ms B, was Myself, Ms B and my friend E. Because I wanted to know what work I was doing (as the school didn\u2019t want me there and had reduced my time table) Ms B had said there was nothing for me to do (in a rude way) and I left, E was standing next to me the entire time. And the door was closed as we were standing just outside the room. E hugged me good by and I went to the shops before heading home. Mrs W had talked to the students in that class today and all told the same story, that I swore (more than likely told by Ms B to say) Mrs W didn\u2019t even talk E before calling my mum and suspending me for 2 days, Wednesday and Friday (as I have my course at the school, Monday and Thursday) and told my mum the next time I was suspended, it was going to be on my course days, meaning I could not go to my course, which is the only reason I am still at this school. (Suspension at my school means you aren\u2019t allowed on school property on the days you are suspended) I am seriously so done with this school and Mrs W and Ms B, Mrs W claims to always be on my side but always chooses \u201cthe rules of the school\u201d before even trying to help.",

More often than not, I even go to the worker on the register, who usually also then makes the food in night shifts, and ask them. I ask them if they actually want to make the food.   \nI get that they have to say yes etc., and never refuse a customer and all that crap. But I often ask them anyway, and if one will ever reply with something like \"honestly, no. I dont want to make fucking food now\", I would be ok with it and leave again.\n\nI often even say \"sorry, but I have to order a lot of stuff\". AKA when I go to subway and order 3 foot long. I say sorry for ordering so much. Because I worked in Subway, and I always hated customers that would come in and single handingly take up the time of 3-4 customers, but are just 1 customer in the line.",

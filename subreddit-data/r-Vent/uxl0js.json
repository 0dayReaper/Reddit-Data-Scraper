You can thank religion for that one.\n\nRepublicans realized they could leverage that sentiment into a platform - described very well by this quote from Dave Barnhart:  \n\n\n&gt;\u201cThe unborn\u201d are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don\u2019t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don\u2019t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don\u2019t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don\u2019t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.\u201d",

I think it's also a control issue, though; misogyny that's founded in historical and religious precedent.",

They refuse either, so it will only get worse. Also, in the original post, he mentions that it's not poverty but I don't think that's entirely true. I don't mean it's homeless people obvs, but the quality of life in America has drastically decreased. We have no control over our homes anymore, and wages are barely rising while corporate America takes every opportunity and excuse to raise prices. Living in America is scary and stressful and demeaning. It doesn't surprise me we have so many shootings because if stupider people are as angry and fed up as I am, I can imagine the leap to violence is a small one.",

The problem is organizations like the NRA are funded by gun manufacturing companies like Remington. Gun manufacturers pay the NRA, who then makes donations with that money to Republican lawmakers in Congress For their campaigns. Because they're receiving that money from the gun manufacturers and the and RA they refused to vote for look for stronger gun control measures. There was a bill that ran through the house when the Republicans had control and it was a gun control bill, a background check and red flag bill which would have done stronger background checks and listed people who had mental health issues in the past with red flags when they go to purchase a gun. The only people to vote against that bill in Congress were the Republican party. Every Democrat, all the democrats voted yes to making this Bill a law,  the Republicans voted against making it a law!  They also repealed a law that Stopped people with certain mental illnesses from being able to purchase guns... They literally killed a law that  Prevented mentally ill people from being able to buy guns,  But now they wanna be so surprised when crazy people go around shooting a bunch of other people. Don't tell me this was unpredictable this has been predictable cause it happens every freaking day... In America we have at least 10 mass shootings A day across the country, We have something like 3000+ mass shootings a year in America,  DON'T fucking tell me this was unpredictable,  it was VERY FUCKING PREDICTABLE!!",

A gun wont kill by itself, unles used by a person, who at the same time, is not in the right state of mind.\n\nLimit access to guns - create as many hoops as needed to get access to them meaning: courses on how a gun works, maintaining it, proper safety procedures and etc. Also, the person gonna go throug a psych check, to determine if the person is stable.\n\nLike OP said - Fuck your thoughts, fuck your prayers, fuck your silence.",

A gun destruction plan goes into place where the public hand over their guns to be destroyed as owning one illegally would carry a hefty prison sentence. \nIt's not the ultimate solution but it's a start. Have a look at the Dunblane school shooting in the UK and what effect that had on gun ownership in the UK. And whilst your at it, have a look at the stats for shootings in the UK vs the US on any given year. \nObviously I'm pissing into the wind here because 'murica and the whatever ammendment and all that.......",

The officer pretty much heard black man with a gun, pulled his gun out and shot him, in front of his children. And yet I didn't hear the NRA coming out in support of Filando Castille but they will quickly come out in support of ANY white man who shoots an unarmed man with a firearm. In fact,  in ALL my 46 years alive, I've never once seen the NRA defend 1 responsible Black gun owner. They get vilified and called criminal,  regardless of whether they were or not.\n\n But the problem is two fold because the problem is not just the system itself but it's  The people we elect to run it.. We keep electing republicans thinking that they're gonna eventually do something but they don't WANT to because they don't NEED to! THE NRA is paying them NOT to and we keep steady electing them into office on one issue that has nothing to do with guns and not realizing that they're never gonna do anything about the problem Of guns.\n\n What does it say that 90% of Americans want background checks on checks and the only people to vote against that are the Republican party? \n\nEvery last Democrat voted yes on background checks and red flag law and EVERY LAST Republican voted NO!!\n\n They literally hold the lives of Americans in their hands every day and refuse to do anything about it because they DON'T care if Americans have to die in order for people to have guns. I've literally seen republicans say that is the cost of freedom, basically inferring that the cost of freedom, of the freedom to own guns, is that people will die at the hands of crazy people and to them, that's acceptable. That is the biggest part of the problem!!",

I. E school shooting, increase in gang and drug related violence, officers being harmed in duty.\nAmerica coukd quite easily solve this like banning guns in public hands unless theirs a lisence or only allow a type of bullet to be allowed in public hands like rubber or bean bag rounds so they can still use it for safety and defence.",

            "comment": "With your logic then guns aren't the problem because guns are not uniquely American. Canada, Switzerland, and Germany all spring to mind as countries with widely available guns yet we don't see the same level of violent attacks in those countries that we see in the US. The real problem in the US is in fact the people commiting the acts not the tools they use to do them. The problem with the people though cannot be traced to one single root cause but I'd say the largest impact that can be made and the one that is somewhat unique to America is the government and how the country is run. Right now Americans are being raised and groomed from birth to be nothing more than tax paying consumers to make the rich in our country richer. Raised to ruin our bodies and minds to line someone else's pockets. We are molded into the perfect little corporate workers through our culture and pathetic excuse for an educational system. We need to start with our system. We  need to educate people to actually be better and smarter and to make a better society not just learn how to fit into an office job or how to work in manufacturing, we need healthcare both mental and physical to care for our citizens, we need to know that an accident or illness isn't going to leave us thousands in debt or worse dead and leaving family in debt because we just couldn't afford it, we need to be able to stop worrying that the police will murder us for no reason or that we'll be thrown in jail for challenging their ego. \n\n\nWe need to be able to stop worrying the government is going to strip us of our rights and push thier religious and political opinions into laws that affect all of us.\n \nWe need proper nonreligious education, improved social programs and we need fucking hope that we can live a decent life.\n\n        My point is everyone wants to blame the HOW of these situations while totally glossing over the WHY. Without figuring out how to solve the cause of violence on a societal level changing the HOW changes nothing. Magically disappear all the guns tomorrow and people will still commit these types of acts, they'll just start using bombs, take those they'll use chemical attacks, take those they'll use fire or knives or sticks. No matter what types of restrictions are put in place violence will happen until the cause of the violent acts are addressed.",

I disagree with insurance and psych evals though, insurance is 100% useless here not to mention expensive( which prices out low income people) and a psych eval is too subjective and open to corruption IMO to be a requirement of ownership.\n\n      But even all those things don't accomplish the goal of reducing violent attacks. All restrictions do without addressing the cause is make it harder on law abiding people to protect themselves from the non law abiding. This is the part that I don't see how people don't understand. A gun is a tool. These people could have just as easily built a bomb or set things on fire and caused equal or greater death and destruction. What needs to be addressed are the reasons the people are commiting the acts in the first place not what tools they use to do them. We need to figure out how to stop the people from commiting violent acts not just try to restrict how they commit them.",

The \"common sense\" measures many of our electeds want to start with would curb gun violence slightly. Serious gun reform could drastically curb gun violence. We know it because it works all over the world.  \n  \nRepeal the second amendment. Ban rifles with magazines and all semi and fully automatic guns. Limit ammo purchases. Require background checks, training, and registration of all handguns and outlaw all public carry of any firearm. Make it a felony to have a gun when/where you shouldn't. That would have a dramatic impact. Or, if it were up to me, ban all guns for all civilians. But we won't do any of it. Because one person's gun is more important than every other person on the planet.  \n  \nFuck guns.",

Even if, in some hypothetical situation, you manage to repeal the 2nd Amendment and find and destroy every single firearm in the USA- it won't stop mass killings.  It will just push killers to other means.  People who want to kill others, WILL kill others.  You don't need a gun to do it.  \n\n&gt; A firearm is a tool.  ...  It is not the tool that determines its work, it is the mind of the man that controls the tool which does.  \n&gt; Evil does not lie in the hands of man, it lies in the hearts of evil men.  Evil men will always find the tools they need to dispense their evil.  \n&gt; --Brannon LeBouef  \n\nI cite as evidence the Nice, France truck attack in 2016- psycho drove a rented cargo truck into a crowd; 86 dead 450+ injured.  Quite frankly I'm surprised attacks like this aren't more common- in a crowd, you can kill a lot more people a lot more quickly with a truck than with a gun.  However I'd guess they're uncommon because the mass SHOOTING people become media celebrities whereas this guy was kind of quietly shuffled off the public radar (probably because he was an immigrant and there was a lot of anti-immigrant sentiment in Europe at the time).  \n\n**So I look at our situation and say, how can we save the most lives?**  I approach that question open minded, without any political or positional bent.  Politics not important only life important.  \n\nTo me, the answer is easy- crime is a distributed problem, mass shootings are a distributed problem.  A centralized solution will not solve a distributed problem, you need a distributed solution.  \n\nConsider an organism that is infected with a disease.  If the organism has a virus or bacteria, you cannot perform surgery to remove the virus or bacteria because it is or could be everywhere.  You need an immune system- cells that exist all over the body and will fight the infection wherever it happens to be.  \n\nTo me, the distributed solution is to not disarm everybody, but to arm the *right* people.  \n\n[Here's what I mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Freeway_Church_of_Christ_shooting).  In 2019 in Texas a guy walked into a church with a gun, and he started killing people.  He killed two- and then an armed civilian shot him.  And that was it.  It didn't make the news because 'only' two people died and nobody likes the narrative of 'arm yourself against psychos'.  But it's an example IMHO.  \n\nAnd I look at the Nice, France attack- what stopped the psycho?  Police, with guns.  Imagine if a few of the people in the crowd were armed?  Do you think that might have reduced the body count?  \nLook at the school shooting.  From what I've read, the psycho was in the school for 20 minutes before a border patrol assault team went in and shot him.  If a couple of the teachers or administrators in the school were armed, do you think that might have reduced the body count?  \n\nTo be clear- I'm not making a MUH GUNS MUH FREEDOM type argument.  I'm talking practical solutions.  I don't think supply-side controls would work for guns, because they don't work for drugs.  I think it's a distributed problem and it needs a distributed solution.",

But not the conventional way, I'm talking that we need security weapons built into the hallways that can be accessed using keycards, biometrics, a lock, facial recognition, and authorization codes by police or faculty remotely.\n\nThe military already figured out the solution for such destructive weapons, which is why we should structure our school's defense the same as we do with nuclear weapons. I'm talking 2 people with 2 keys turned at the same kind sort of thing. Also have as many firewalls as possible and have the systems retract into the ceilings and/or walls.\n\nSchools should continue to have standard lockdown protocols dare I say even stricter protocols, so the shooter will be in the halls alone. I'd much rather hear a hail of gunfire if it means putting down the shooter.",

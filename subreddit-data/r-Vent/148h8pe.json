    "postText": "I'm an outcast, nobody wants to interact with me.\n\nNo matter what I do, I always get the same results, when I find friends to hang out and I'm finally feeling happy, I always end up being ghosted. On 2019 I've had a group of friends where I could be myself without being judged, we were always hanging around in the park doing joint rotations, talking about what made us happy, heck, we even organized raves together, it was a blast. But suddenly in 2020 everyone was gone, everytime I went to our spot, they weren't there, and one day when I've founded them, they told me to fuck off because I did something none of tolerated. I'm not going to give details but I've said that's fair, I wasn't proud of what I did and up until this day I'm really ashamed of that.\n\nDuring 2021 I've met a girl and she was totally my type, after a few months I've confessed her and she said that she wasn't interested to be in a relationship, we stood as friends and it was fun for a little while. One day she told me if I wanted to make a sleepover with friends, she brought a guy and I brought someone of my last group of friends who wasn't mad at me. It was all fine until I went to the roof alone to smoke, and when I came back, they were doing a threesome. I felt so out of place that I've ran away from there in the middle of the night in a city an hour away from mine. We've never talked again.\n\nI was alone again plus heartbroken, I needed to do something, and someone I knew during Pride day 2 years before reached me if I wanted to go to a festival, and I gladly did. I had a lot of fun the first days, but remember what happened on 2020 with my old group of friends? That's right, I did the same mistake twice and I didn't noticed. They told me the same thing and I went back home, once again, feeling alone.\n\nFast-forward to the end of 2021, I've met another girl, she's lovely and we've been together since the first time we saw each other. I told her everything I've told you and she felt bad for me, and she wanted to introduce me to her friends, awesome, girlfriend and friends all in one package, well, I haven't spoken to her best friend since my girlfriends birthday. I didn't got along with her, she was being a dick when we were discussing where to get dinner, she was the only one with a well paid job and she's always complaining that we always go to cheap places (hello stupid whore, there's 6 of us and our bank accounts are on red). I argued with her and ask her to give me back the money for the present of my girlfriends birthday, plus, I didn't went, I'm a fucking asshole and I feel disgusting.\n\nNow, she left me, there's no one else, everyone is gone and I feel helpless, I'm going to throw myself down the mountain and finish my life, I'm sick of this, I'm finished.",

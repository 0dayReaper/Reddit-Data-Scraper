I\u2019m sure your twin means well with disagreeing with you stopping treatment, but she\u2019s wrong with her actions. *You can\u2019t change someone\u2019s mind.* All that you can do is hope that she meets you in the middle. \n\nIf my sister had cancer and wanted to stop treatment, I would honestly disagree. I don\u2019t know how treatment affects you \u2014 mentally, physically, emotionally \u2014 but from my small understanding, I would see it as something that you *have* to do. In reality, you don\u2019t. However, I wouldn\u2019t forget to wish my sister a \u2018happy birthday\u2019 or reject the flowers that she didn\u2019t need to send me. \n\nThere has been times when my birthday creeped up on me. I\u2019m sorry that people forgot about your birthday. *You should be seen more than just your cancer.* Hopefully, they didn\u2019t mean to forget your birthday; if your decision to stop doing treatment was recent, they might have been focused on that. If you\u2019re comfortable, I think you should tell them.\n\nHave you ever seen Ted Lasso? Well, in one of the episodes Ted is saying \u2018thank you for [\u2026] and fuck you [\u2026]\u2019 when he\u2019s talking to his mom.\n\n*Thank you for staying by my side when I got cancer, but fuck you for forgetting my birthday.*\n\n*Thank you for worrying about me and my decision, but fuck you for not understanding that it\u2019s my choice to make.*\n\n*Thank you for being there, but fuck you for putting mixing who I am with my cancer.*\n\n*Thank you for being my twin, but fuck you for turning your back on me when I needed you.*",

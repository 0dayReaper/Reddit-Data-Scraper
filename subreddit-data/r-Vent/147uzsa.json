    "postText": "I hate my body so much at the moment! I am fairly skinny, but I have a wide ribcage and a big chest, which makes me look fat. \nI don't have a pretty jawline like all the singers, actresses and influencers I see everywhere and my nose is horrible! It's waaaaaayyy to big and protrudes so much and my nostrils also look awful to me.\nI don't like the shape of my head or my body proportions either.\n\nI used to feel so confident, but since a couple days it's all going down the drain and I keep comparing myself to others and feeling insecure, insignificant and hopeless... And I have no idea why I'm feeling this way all of a sudden.\n\nThe world is full of beautiful people and I feel like I am not one of them, so I keep asking myself whether there is even a place for me on earrh.\nIs it possible to love me, when I look like this? I don't wanna die alone, I wanna become a mom someday but I don't want my child(ren) to resemble me and feel this shitty about themselves.\n\nI wish I could just return time to when I still felt good about myself, I don't know what to do :((",

    "postText": "Every time I look on the internet it's always something about how my community is being illegalized in this country and it's terrible for my mental health. \n\nEvery time I see something about the Republican party taking away the rights of lgbtq individuals I have to go into my room lock the door and have a mental breakdown for 30 minutes because things just getting worse and worse in this country.\nI am now constantly angry at the Injustice that people like me are facing and it's insane that history truly does repeat.\n\nOnce again another group of people are being discriminated by the masses and everyone is going along with it, does anyone remember slavery? Does anyone remember the Holocaust? Anyone remember all the times minorities have been discriminated against and it was later found out to be the immoral thing to do?\n\nI need to stop looking at the news for my mental health, but I keep looking at it to see if there's anything good to help raise my hopes and then I get disappointed all over again.",

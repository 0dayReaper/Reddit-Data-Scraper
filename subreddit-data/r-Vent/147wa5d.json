Feels like I don\u2019t actually have any control for which direction my life is going. There\u2019s so much I wanna say, and I just hold it in cause I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m relying on my parents for housing, my girlfriend and her fkn mom for my phone and service. My best friend is probably gonna end up watching my cat when I go to Canada to see her again, and we talk mad shit about him behind his back.\n\nEverything feels wrong. Idk what I can do to take control anymore. Every time I get like this, it\u2019s like a new low. Im anticipating it again. Last night I listened to some music and really had a good time, I was in high spirits, and I was enjoying breathing. Not this morning tho.. I shaved my legs thinking that maybe it would change how I see myself, but now it\u2019s just prickly all over and hurts to walk. I\u2019ve damaged my hearing in persuit of art, and now when I try to sleep in silence, both of my ears ring at different pitches, reminding me that I am the reason my life is this way.\n\nAnd when I try to say anything to anyone, im just complaining. Seriously lost right now. I know im depressed, and pessimism comes east when im low. But I also know why im depressed and there\u2019s just nothing I can do about any of it, or atleast it feels that way right now.",

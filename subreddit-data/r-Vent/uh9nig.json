I've seen Texas and Oklahoma both make abortion harder to access, now the Supreme Court is trying to over turn Roe vs Wade. \n\nHalf of these new laws aren't even being voted on, like the one in Oklahoma. It just now is what it is aprerently. \n\nI dont have kids, because of all the shit parents I see all the time, all the kids who are in foster care, the planet is dying, Putin, China. God, its like everyone is dying and suffering all over the world, except a handful of us, but God forbid I decide not to bring more life into this shit world. \n\nI dont have kids, partly because of medical reasons. Now, if I got pregnant, I could die or be crippled for life, on top of raising a child with the new laws. \n\nIts fine if you want to believe abortion is wrong because of your religion, that doesn't mean it should be forced on me. \n\nThe people in this world make me sick.\n\nUpdate: I must have really pissed some of y'all off lol. Im getting pms now. I won't entertain them, you will be blocked. I won't be harrased, intimidated, or swayed on this. Feel free to waste your time trying though.",

So they make you wait until you about to actually die, before even doing that. \n\nI might go ahead and mention to my husband about getting a vasectomy. He mentioned being willing before, but I felt it unnecessary to make either of us have surgery at this age, for reproduction like that. Now, i have a different opinion. I'll run it by him, I would never push him to do it, but I cant get an abortion anymore. Its very expensive and hard to get my tubes tied, I dont think a hysterectomy is even legal probably. I disagree with late term abortion, you know if your pregnant by a certain time almost all of the time, but early abortions should be legal.",

If it is life then your right over your body can't violate the basic human rights of the fetus.\n\nI think a common ground is simple here. Just decide when the fetus is life. Once deemed life it can't be aborted. Additionally no one can be charged with murder if they terminate a fetus before it is deemed life with an act because you can't murder something that isn't alive.",

The fact of the matter is that being pro-choice doesn't even mean that you would personally have an abortion. It means that you believe that a woman should have the right to a safe one if that is what she chooses to do. I have plenty of friends who would never terminate if they were to get pregnant but they are pro-choice.

My cousin and I were two years apart in age. His symptoms showed at 8-10 years old, began treatment, at age 13 he was bound to a wheelchair, had suffered several strokes, was blind, and then passed after a seizure. He was one of the oldest surviving cases with his form of ALD. I was 15 when he passed away in our living room.

I'm trans and I have endometriosis, for a lot of reasons it's nearly impossible for me to get pregnant but I rely on testosterone and birth control to keep my endo in check. Before I got my first IUD, I was in absolute agony every day. I was missing at least a day of school a week. It hurt so much and I can't stress that enough. Birth control and then testosterone saved my life. I'm making plans for if I'm somehow forced to go off of testosterone. I might get another IUD, even though my last one was messed up and the insertion was genuinely traumatizing. I can't go back to how I was before birth control and testosterone. I don't know if I could survive that.\n\nI'm looking into immigration to Canada or Ireland once I graduate college. I desperately don't want to leave Ohio, I love my state, but I might have to and it's really, really scary.",

As you can see there\u2019s a lack of choice, however, there are multiple verses in Quran emphasizing that human\u2019s have a choice even in choosing their religion and it\u2019s upon them to read, reflect and contemplate and make their decisions.

I tried getting an iud put in, but my dr said my pelvis was posteriorly tilted so she would have to force it in and cause me extreme pain so I decided to stay on the pill. I believe women should have a right to what grows inside their body. Conception being \"the start of life\" is kind of fuckin bullshit cus its just a pile of nut in your coochie. Hasn't implanted yet or nothin. If you catch it within 6 weeks you can take a pill and it just gets flushed out. Although after the 5-6 weeks mark, the baby usually has a heartbeat &amp; is more of a baby than a ball of cells. My aunt found jesus and now says abortion is a sin or some shit even though I know for a fact she had at least like 3 or 4 when she was young. That is the shit I DO NOT support. 1 should be enough, you shouldn't get like a punchcard and special offers for being an idiot. Now I know on average, women who get late trimester abortions typically do it after a miscarriage &amp; don't want to go through birth for a baby that's already died, that's completely understandable. If it was a rape I think you should get a pass because well I wouldn't want to carry a rapists baby either. It's our job as women to practice safe sex so we don't have to go through an abortion, it shouldn't be used as a form of birth control thats just extremely irresponsible &amp; well honestly pretty awful.

Rather than just letting people die, they just made seatbelts mandatory. Same with sex Ed, rather than being like \"well you shouldn't have had sex\", they teach about it, and avoid the issue. \n\nSo no, people shouldn't just get a bunch of abortions all the time. BUT, what normal, logical person is doing that? No one. You have drug addicts, prostitutes, etc, that you don't want raising kids, or birthing them into a system. Id rather people get early term abortions, pre 16 weeks, than be told they can only have 1 and have to raise the rest in the trap house. \n\nYou can't just get your tubes tied in a lot of places. Its \"legal\" but hard to find a doctor, and if you do, you have to be \"approved\", a lot of times having approval from your husband even. \n\nBut aside from all that, we just hit rock bottom and stripped so much away that small things like that are irrelevant",

If there\u2019s no more abortions, they should pay for the fucking mistake if a woman is forced to as well. Nobody gets out of the situation anymore. In it for life \u270c\ud83c\udffc \n\n3.

It\u2019s not \u201cgod\u2019s\u201d work so make that illegal too then.

Why not rush to make this vote and avoid having some opposition once a more liberal voice joins? The time to act is now! (Is the thought of the court atm) \n\nSo sad, a joke, and just so many emotions. \nKinda wish all the women actually agreed on how nobody should be able to make decisions for our bodies and have a mass nationwide protest\u2026but one can only dream.

Wade codified a \"right\" to murder; its removal returns the issue to the states. You're going down an extremely slippery slope if you want to argue that it isn't murder - the *viability* and *undue burden* standards were inherently ridiculous in the face of what abortion actually is. I am free to live in a community and vote with my community to ban abortion in my community because it is murder. Don't like it? Leave. We don't want you here - or in your words, \"fuck any and everyone who advocates for the murder of unborn children.\"\n3. You do not have a right to kill a third party because they inconvenience you. All the arguments for abortion are the same tired tropes we had to fight against in the slavery movement. \"My property, my choice.\" \"You're free to not own slaves, but don't tell me what to do with mine.\" See the pattern?\n4. I frankly don't care what you think about my life, seeing as you clearly don't value life in any real capacity beyond your own selfish, personal convenience. That said, it is outside of my power to convince you that murder is not okay when you've decided that it is. You exist in a world so fundamentally and morally disconnected from my own that debating the issue itself is pointless.\n\nWe live in entirely different worlds, so you stay in your vile little world while the rest of us will stay in ours.",

Instead of avoiding problems like unwanted children, ignorant people like you just expect people to raise them. \n\nIf abortion was more acceptable, I might not have to help raise my brother in laws kids. I don't have kids, because there are too many unwanted children. How many kids have you adopted? \n\nOr do you just expect people to suffer because they don't agree with your religous beliefs? I already know the answer, no need to reply. It won't have anything intelligent in it anyway. I stopped reading at \"keep your legs closed\". \n\nDo you assume everyone pro abortion needs one? You probably think everyone pro lgbtq is gay and everyone pro blm is black too.",

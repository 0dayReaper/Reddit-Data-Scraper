My mother keeps judging people and I try to defend the strangers (because we don't know them, they could actually be really nice people and shit like that) BUT NO WHAT IM DOING IS WRONG.\n\nI don't fucking get it. She keeps forcing her opinions on me and I've made it clear to her MULTIPLE TIMES that I disagree with her and she keeps saying \"oh youre just young now. You'll understand when you'll be older\" NO I JUST RESPECT PEOPLE BECAUSE UNLIKE YOU I DID EXPERIENCE SOME SHIT THAT DID LEAVE A MARK ON ME AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WHAT I FUCKING EXPERIENCED\n\nWorse part is that she does this with my friends too. She dislikes one of my friends because they're from north Macedonia and dresses a bit \"emo\". She dislikes two other friends because they're Muslim. She talked shit about a girl Im somewhat friends with because that girl is in the LGBTQ community. I have many more examples but most of her reasons to hate on othesr is because she's either Christian (which doesn't excuse shit) or the fact that she's greek (Fuck our history, I don't fucking care about shit that happend 200 years ago, it doesn't excuse anything).\n\nShe told me \"Respect other people\" while growing up, but doesn't seem like what you're fucking doing mate, that's just fucking bullshit. I fucking hate her behaviour and can't deal with it any fucking longer",

    "postText": "I hate how life and our culture was made up. I cannot believe as a woman these are the cards I have been dealt with. When i marry I will have to choose between my child and an occupation I probably enjoyed for 5 or so years. I hate the feeling that I can't have anything. Everything I do is a sacrifice. Please I know men do too, and i love them for all they provide for society but this is my frustration so plz be receptive xoxo\n\nI just wish I could have it all, I m so jealous of rich people, they can hire people to help them at home. I'm also envious of cultures where maternal family is very close. They could look after ur baby and you wouldn't have to choose. I'm just so envious of men too, if they have a dream or passion they can die while doing it and simultaneuosly be good parents. But I can't choose, it's like the world robbed me of choice in this matter. I am greatful men can work for us, but I just wish I was doing something more. Let's call a spade a spade, parenting is hard sure but it really is ordinary, like it just is tbh. (maybe it is my culture) I wanna be extraordinary. I want to be useful to someone outside my personal space (family). I want a bigger impact. I hate how people think the love of your kids and love of your outside activities are mutually exclusive. I don't want to live this earth with only the label of \"mother\". The title is indeed miraculous, God bless, however it really just is ordinary. I hope this is understandable im not good with words xoxo",

    "postText": "Okay, I'm going to preface this by saying that I know everyone's driving experience is going to be different depending on where they live. Personally, the level of juvenile and childish behavior I have to deal with on the road never ceases to amaze me.\n\nToday for example, the person in front of me probably thought I was following too closely, because they kept slamming on their brakes. I finally got tired of it and decided to go around them, and when they saw what I was doing, they accelerated down the road.\n\nAnother time, I was passing by a slower driver like many of us do a 100 times a day. A few seconds later, I saw this same guy go flying past me as if my passing him was offensive. \n\nMost of the time, it's people who see me and start accelerating before I even have the opportunity to pass them.\n\n What's going on? I'm not an aggressive driver, but I am a fast driver. I like to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible, but I still use my turn signal at all times and yield to the right of way of other drivers. I don't understand why people are so concerned about fast driving or another person's desire to pass them. Unless someone's driving in an unsafe manner, I don't allow other people's driving behaviors to dictate what I'm doing.",

    "postText": "What is wrong with me? Am I that different from people? Am I that difficult to love? I know not many people understand me. I know most of them just tolerate me and that\u2019s the best I can ask for most people. Being tolerated is better than not being acknowledged or even ignored. Being tolerated all my life I just want to know what love is. What being accepted for all your flaws and for who you are as a person, no matter the mistakes I make. Logically I know my family does that; emotionally I don\u2019t believe it. Maybe its the neglect that makes me think that I\u2019m worthless; maybe its the neglect that makes me think I need to always succeed to be worth noticing; maybe that\u2019s the reason why I think to be loved means to be good at something or to be useful. If I can\u2019t do anything would I still be worthy of love? Is love something to be given to those who are worthy? What is worth to love? So many questions; I try to logic but I just can\u2019t. What is there to logic when you love someone?\n\nI often think back to Arcane. How Silco was torn between everything he ever wanted and Jinx and you just knew that he would have chosen Jinx every time. Will someone do that for me? Would someone choose me every time? I don\u2019t know. I just want to be loved. Why does it feel like too much to ask? I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t be able to do that. To give up your future for someone. Its scary to think that one person is worth it all. Maybe it\u2019s because I wasn\u2019t given the chance to feel unconditional love that I just don\u2019t understand it.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be loved; if I\u2019ll ever be happy.  I don\u2019t know if anyone would love me unconditionally. Maybe I won\u2019t be loved. Will I be okay with that? I don\u2019t want to think about it.",

I moved into a friend\u2019s spare bedroom and didn\u2019t even bother to unpack because I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m worthy of a proper bedroom. I\u2019m starving constantly because I can\u2019t afford food. The hours and money at my job are pathetic. My bosses don\u2019t respect me. My family doesn\u2019t bother to contact me. I am a loser and it\u2019s over.",

            "comment": "A nice savings means you were able to save up at some point, which is great! You even got a degree, which is not easy for a lot of people. Props to you. A friend willing to let you stay means you have support, how kind of them. It sucks the job is shit, but that also means you can pull a job! Maybe start looking for a new one, see if you get lucky?\n\nIt absolutely suck, life is really hard. All we can ever really do is try to spin the sadness we sell ourselves and try to remember how worthy we really are. You ARE worthy, or you wouldn\u2019t have had some of those highs to end up at such a low place. That\u2019s worth fighting for. \n\nThere\u2019s also more to it, I know. It\u2019s not all \u201cput in the work = get everything back\u201d. Like I said, life sucks. Some things just aren\u2019t in our control though, so we have to look inward at what we can.\n\nPlease try unpacking your things in your friend\u2019s place. That\u2019s very generous of them, and great support.",

I applied to 300 jobs, and got 2 interviews that went nowhere. We called, visited, and emailed organizations/churches/nonprofits/social services every single day. No response, no help. I had a nonprofit local organization that was created to help homeless people straight up refuse to help us. Churches ignored us. The Salvation Army ignored us. Social Services said there was nothing they could do because we had jobs and according to them, we didn\u2019t need help. Low income housing claimed we \u201cmade too much money\u201d but they don\u2019t take bills into consideration. We had medical debt, bad credit, 2 car payments, phones, I had medications I needed to pay for, and we got sucked into a cycle of payday loan apps. I lived in Maryland, USA. This was from September 9th 2022 to May 7th 2023.\n\nAround 2pm on May 7th my husband and I began an 11 hour 600+ mile drive from Maryland to Michigan. Very early morning of May 8th, we made it to the house of a close friend that offered to take us in. No job, no money, one car because we surrendered the other, we gave up most of our belongings including clothes and sentimental items. \n\nTomorrow is June 14th. It\u2019s also my first day at my first full time job, making more money than I\u2019ve made before. My husband works for a staffing agency right now but he has 2 job offers and he\u2019s choosing one to accept tomorrow, both full time and in his career field. We have food stamps and health insurance and I\u2019m getting myself taken care of. We have a kitten together now, we love our friends/roommates, and we love their 3 year old son. We have a bed and a roof over our heads. We don\u2019t have to drive just to use a bathroom. We can actually cook and buy real groceries. \n\nI left behind a few family members and coworkers I loved dearly. I left behind everything I know. But I also left behind toxicity, abuse, financial ruin, and a broken version of myself. I\u2019m only 24. My husband is only 23. \n\nIt gets better but it takes *work*.",

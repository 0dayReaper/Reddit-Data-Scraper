    "postText": "I\u2019ve been talking to this girl for about 1 year now. We are about 2.5 years apart in age so she is still in high school. We both agreed that we would wait until she is about done with high school. recently she\u2019s been kind of talking to this guys that she went to prom with (I knew they were going together) but it escalated after that. They did sexual things together (that she told me about, and lied about as well). She also had me come over to do the same, now I feel I am being treated as a \u201csneaky link\u201d and an option, and the same for him. So the other day she was hanging out with this guy, went to the beach and dinner\u2026 and after she got home she told me to come over\u2026 I tried talking to her saying how I feel and she wouldn\u2019t give me a straight answer. So I called this guy and told him everything while I was at her house. I love her and I don\u2019t know if I should try and contact her or not. From my knowledge, her and I, and him and her are all not talking. However him and I started texting some what because we both feel bad for each other.",

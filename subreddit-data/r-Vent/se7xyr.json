WE ARENT GONNA TALK ABOUT THE UNDERAGE PEOPLE FUCKING CONSTANTLY?? OKAY!",

To omit or censor sex would be a dishonest portrayal of the story that is trying to be told. Sex does sell but it also can have a purpose in art beyond just being used for attention.",

Second, as I mentioned in my original comment, omitting these parts specifically because people are afraid to see sex is an unfaithful telling of the story that was originally trying to be told. If you don\u2019t want to see sex then don\u2019t watch it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f, but it is explored in a very emotionally intelligent and interesting way throughout the show and should not be discounted just because \u201cwe all know it happens\u201d. We all know drugs happen, friendships happen, love happens, but all good stories show how these phenomena can deeply effect the people involved.",

I guess I never really thought people had sex in high school, but I should've known. I've always been the weird autistic quiet skinny kid that doesn't talk much. \"Why are you so quiet?\", \"why are you so skinny?\" \"Do you eat? Lmao.\" \"Omg, he's soooooo skinny.\" \"You only weigh 65 lbs in 8th grade? What's your secret to staying so skinny?\" Guess what my answer was to all of that? Nothing. I ignored it. I tried my best to not let it bother me. Little did those people know, I'm autistic. Little did those people know, I have gastrointestinal issues which is very common in autistic people. Little did those people know, I want to gain weight so bad, but my low appetite and gastrointestinal problems make it extremely difficult. Oh well, I was a virgin loser in high school. I'm like that skinny loser virgin nerd kid in those high school movies. I'm still a loser. 21 year old male virgin who's never even kissed a girl. But don't worry guys, I don't hate anyone. I'm a forgiving person, but forgiving those people didn't raise my self esteem. I still have low self esteem to this day. I would love to find ways to raise my self esteem, but I don't know how. Anyone have any tips? To the person I commented this to, sorry for bothering you. You don't have to respond if you don't want to.",

High school kids don\u2019t understand the impact they can have on the people around them. Just remember it\u2019s okay to feel how you\u2019re feeling and it\u2019s a learned defense mechanism. You\u2019re young and the more time that goes by the better you\u2019ll be able to deal with the conditioning that developed from these experiences. The only thing I can recommend is finding someone in real life that you can be completely open about your feelings to and allow them to try and help you, whether it be a parent, a friend, a teacher, or a therapist.",

If you're so vehemently against this shouldn't you also be against shows and movies that show high levels of drug use like scarface, the wolf of wall street and pineapple express.\nWhat about shows and movies that glorify killing? RED, John wick, James Bond.\nWhat about movies that glorify torture? Savages, Saw, human centipede.\nWhat about movies that encourage massacres? Movies like world war z, resident evil, even Zombieland.\n\nWhy do you draw the line at only depictions of teen sex?\n\nWe know it's wrong, just like we know that torture is wrong, murder is wrong, drug smuggling is wrong, rape is wrong. But you choose to pick one small thing and forget the rest.\n\nIt is media, I'm pretty sure there are warnings in the intro or outro somewhere and no underage people are actually used for the explicit scenes.\n\nJust like movies that depict suicide, self harm, depression and many other mental health disorders. They have warnings.\n\nIf you're going to have an issue with one of these things, have an issue with all of them.",

Anyway, the characters are teenagers and it\u2019s really fucking uncomfortable to see these teenagers nude or having graphic sex scenes. It\u2019s the same reason Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me left a really bad taste in my mouth, Laura and her friend are teenagers and they have a nude scene. It\u2019s weird as fuck.

The Vampire Diaries was one of the worst ones, I loved that show when I was in high school but the amount of sex scenes were actually absurd. For me, it\u2019s uncomfortable to watch and implying it is so easy I can only think of two reasons why its shown so commonly;\n\n1. Creepy ass directors and producers\n2. Filler to extend watch time \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard anyone rave about how much they loved a sex scene, not online or irl. As a viewer, it has no value to me and the actors don\u2019t like it either. That\u2019s why top earning actors usually have a no nudity clause in their contract. Even if they\u2019re shown as nude on screen, it\u2019s probably a body double. \n\nSo, it\u2019s exploitative as all hell cause then the auditions available to lower earning actors will often REQUIRE nudity. Which leaves few options other than be uncomfortable - or even traumatized - just to get paycheck and \u201cexposure\u201d or \u201cexperience\u201d. All that just because they can\u2019t afford a legal team and management to protect them. \n\nThen add in the fact that the characters are fresh out the womb and I\u2019m truly nauseated. I didn\u2019t even finish the first episode of euphoria which bums me out a bit.  Most of it looks so interesting and Zendaya is one of favorite actresses but I just couldn\u2019t sit through the scene of the blonde girl in the motel.

As a member of that sub, it is annoying when people complain about the nudity &amp; sex because people that complain about it act as if these people aren't fully grown adults who are simply playing the role of a teenager. \n\nYou're not being forced to watch the show &amp; there are multiple warnings right before the show starts. It's a rated R show on HBO for goodness sake. This isn't a new trend for HBO, its been this way for decades. Why continue to watch something you have such an issue with? That sub is for fans of the show. There's nothing wrong with criticism, but seeing people constantly complaining about a show they're choosing to watch in a sub dedicated to said show, is pretty irritating when you can simply not watch it, move on with your life, &amp; just let those who enjoy it, do so in peace.",

Downvote me all you people want but I stand by what I said and I'll say it again. It's ridiculous to go onto a sub dedicated to a show, just to complain about the nudity in that R-rated show that literally warns you that there will be nudity before it begins and then complain about people on the sub being annoyed over your complaints. Simply don't watch the show. That's like me not liking the color blue yet I continue to buy &amp; wear clothes that are blue. It makes no sense.\n\n The majority of us don't  watch the show, see a nude scene and think \"oh they're showing minors naked!\" Because we know it's a SHOW &amp; the actors are adults. The show is about teens abusing drugs, alcohol,  being promiscuous and all of the issues it causes, so it shows those exact things. It isn't a show about implying those things. If they wanted to imply, they wouldn't have it on a channel you have to pay for a subscription to watch.",

It\u2019s weird watching a show about teenagers that I don\u2019t feel like is meant to be watched by teenagers.. I\u2019ve also heard no one but me say a thing about all the graphic teen sex either. And when others ask me about the show and if they should watch it, I always tell them to watch it alone to avoid being uncomfortable.",

Not that i support it, but it would be at least a bit more understandable. \n\nHowever, when I was a teenager, I was really naive and diagnosed with many mental-illnesses, and I have to say, no matter how much these shows wanted to show how bad it is to take drugs, do sex, etc., it was still \"cool\" enough to make me want to do it more. I ended up being an alcoholic at age of 16 and even attempted to kill myself two times - what inspired me a lot and romanticized the subject was a show \"13 reasons why\", and I think it kinda falls into the same category of shows as Euphoria. It doesn't matter that somewhere in the show there were hints that \"kill yourself is bad don't do it\", as a child I saw only the romanticized subject of two lovers and suicide and it really did made a big impact on my mental health. I'm not saying I wasn't suicidal before watching the show, I was fucked up my whole childhood, but these things were encouraging me to do and try these things more, end of the story. :-(",

And this just tells me not to bother with it\u2026 which sucks because most tv shows now have sex scenes\u2026 \n\nAside from that, society has now accepted sex in media as normal (which I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t) but they\u2019re making it easily accessible to children. Yes parents should watch what their kids watch but at the same time when I was younger porn wasn\u2019t even that accessible unless we knew the sites or the channels and that\u2019s if they weren\u2019t parent control blocked. Now we just have to watch any pg13/pg14 show and there it is\u2026",

A friend of mine played a few episodes when I went over to visit and I just couldn't help but cringe seeing a high school character hypersexualized. I expressed my opinion on it and was told that I was a prude. I'm a grown ass adult and I can see why younger audiences are into it but it's just personally not my cup of tea.",

And not one, or two of the characters, but nearly every single one of the main female cast. Not ALL teenagers are like that and I think that's what the show misses.  \nI know its a drama, but a lot of teenagers will watch this and attach to a character they like. I hate to think they need to go through this stuff because that's what character x did.\n\nAnd I'm sure I'll get a lot of hate. I know a lot of people are die hard fans of the show.",

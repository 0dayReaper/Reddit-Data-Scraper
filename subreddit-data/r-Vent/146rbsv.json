    "postText": "My dad is an extremely talented man. He\u2019s so smart, but has been through so much. His own father wasn\u2019t in the picture and his mom didn\u2019t want to deal with him anymore. He could\u2019ve been someone else if only he\u2019d had the support. Nobody wants to be around him. He is so insufferable. He hates everyone. His own children don\u2019t even want to acknowledge the fact that he\u2019s their father. Even though he\u2019s so gifted, he was destined to fail.\n\nThere is so much more to this story but I don\u2019t feel comfortable with putting that out on the internet. But his story had me thinking, what is the point? Because this made me realize no matter how amazing someone is, they still have a very slim chance to succeed in life. People\u2019s chances of succeeding are determined by their birth. If he was born into a normal family, he could\u2019ve been great. He could\u2019ve been a dad.\n\nMy mom is afraid of me becoming like him, she is already starting to compare us. I\u2019ve never imagined myself becoming him ever. I can\u2019t imagine. I hate being compared to him. The amount of shit he\u2019s put me through is ridiculous. The fact that my mom and her boyfriend has the audacity to do that when they know he\u2019s traumatized me is fascinating honestly. It pisses me off. Everybody underestimates what I\u2019m going through. I am so sick of it. God tests me everyday. Every fucking day. I understand that so many people are going through a trillion times worse and still don\u2019t complain, but if that\u2019s how the world is I don\u2019t want to live in it.",

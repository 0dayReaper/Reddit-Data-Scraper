Most people see that both men and women can be beautiful. However, you seem to think that women have inherent power through their beauty and that men are seen as subhuman. \n\nAllow me to illustrate why both male and female lives are difficult.\n\nWomen: periods every month, debilitating cramps, catcalled by creeps, kidnapped, assaulted, constantly on guard against the dangers of the world. \n\nMen: treated more harshly, expected to be competent at everything, less support, seen as threats, bound by weird masculinity standards. \n\nAlso, what's with the sick face on your second point? It's true. Men like pretty boys, women like pretty boys... *people* like pretty boys. Lol. And they also like rugged guys. As well as everyone in between. Ask women what their types are and you'll see that many are *turned off* by stereotypically handsome looks. Some of them like their men nerdy, or lanky, or big. \n\nThere is someone for everyone, basically.",

Think about that\u2014for every three women you see, at least one has been touched against her will. Many more are kidnapped off the streets every day. Sometimes even in broad daylight. It's much more common than you seem to think, and definitely not \"trying to be the victim\". It's just... fact. \n\nThere are areas of the world where women are seen as subservient second-class citizens. They aren't even allowed to show their faces. They are constantly beaten, mutilated, and shamed. \n\nIn addition, there is no such thing as a \"top percent\" of men, because like I said, there are around 8 billion people on earth and not everyone likes the exact same body type. The \"top percent\", if even existent, would be constantly shape-shifting every second of the day. I think you can see how that would be unrealistic. \n\nYou are giving yourself grief over very arbitrary things. Ideas that\u2014if you look at the statistics\u2014simply don't exist in reality. There is no \"Chad\", no \"big rule\" that each gender follows. \n\nHumans have endless variation. And you're going to be stuck in this depressive pit until you acknowledge that.

What\u2019s more important is how you view *yourself.*\n\nEdit: Upon reading OP's responses to all the other comments, I'm actually pretty sure the real reason why women don't like him is because he's an incel on top of being too lazy to actually get up and do anything to improve his life. I'm all for ranting about being annoyed by stuff that happens in life, but if you're not actually going to change then there's no point in helping you. So with that in mind I'd suggest to everyone that you shouldn't engage because it's obvious he won't do anything to improve his situation.",

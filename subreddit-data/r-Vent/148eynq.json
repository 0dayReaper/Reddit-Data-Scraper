    "postText": "She messaged me Sunday night asking if we had gone to bike week and that she didn\u2019t know if she was going to go. I said that we went Sunday morning when it wasn\u2019t super busy yet. \nI told her how my bf \u201cK\u201d was looking forward to seeing her this weekend. He has been talking about it for the last 2 weeks because we normally meet up with her there. \nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know if she was gonna go but never gave any explanation of why, which is fine. I asked her if she wanted me to let K know or if she was going to and she said that she would message him. I had already told K that she texted me Sunday night and that I wasn\u2019t going to read it until morning so I would just let him know what she said in the morning.  I explained that she might not be able to go before she messaged him and he was a little sad about it but he understood. She ended up messaging him Monday night and explained why. She has to go in for hip scan, if it comes out okay she said she might go. \n\nEvery time she needs to tell us something kind of important she txts me and then I have to tell my bf and it just makes me feel like the bad guy. I told K because he asked what she said and I\u2019m not going to keep secrets from him. No one is mad at anyone else in this situation but it just sucks to disappoint my bf.",

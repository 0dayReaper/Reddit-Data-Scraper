    "postText": "I don't know why but i think ERs are useless at this point. My daughter(4) decided to do a front roll into a corner of a wall and busted her head open. It was bleeding alot, i was freaking out, brought her to the ER. They didn't even do anything about her head until 4 hrs later. Like you're telling me it takes 4 hours to put a staple? They came in after the first hr and cleaned her head. Left for another hour, then the 3rd hour they put numbing medicine on her head and recleaned it. Left for another hour then came back, cleaned it again and then stapled it. My daughter is 4 freaking years old, i think all that caused more trauma than anything else. She was having to re-build up that scared feeling every fkin hour, screaming at the top of her lungs over the drs coming in and retouching her head over and over just to leave for an hour a piece. Oh, and around hr #2 i told them her head was bleeding again and they took 10-20 mins just to come look at it again and make sure it was okay. WHERE'S THE SENSE OF URGENCY? we left at 12AM with most of the rooms around us empty. Shit just pisses me off, especially when it comes to my child in pain.",

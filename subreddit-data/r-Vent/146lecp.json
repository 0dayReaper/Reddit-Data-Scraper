    "postText": "I used to live in such a beautiful apartment with my mom. I mean sure she considered it as a \u201cshoebox\u201d but it was home. The people were nice, total privacy, and I had real freedom. Everything was conveniently close, and I had so many opportunities. Well, my mom is obsessed with luxury and decided we were gonna move to the richest town in the state. Here\u2019s the catch: we are renting the bottom corner of the home from a rich business owner. Well, first of all, we have a pool but can only use it in the winter. Lovely right? Because I wanna swim in 40 degree weather. I\u2019m a medicinal marijuana user, and I can\u2019t even have my medicine on the property. So I have suffered greatly from my severe anxiety and PTSD. Next off, I have had to whisper anything and everything for 2 weeks straight. 2 months to fucking go. I talk normally and I\u2019m told to quiet down while this owner and his screaming children will be stomping around at 6AM. I have had so many sleepless nights now because of these fucks. I just hibernated for 22 hours because I have racked up so much sleep debt. My options for jobs are insanely limited, considering we live in a suburb with very few shops and other jobs. And to top it all off, the house is insanely neglected. You can tell because nothing fucking works. I don\u2019t think it was worth it at all to move here but my mom is like \u201cwe\u2019re so lucky to live in such luxury\u201d. Like what luxury? We\u2019re basically paying to be this fucker\u2019s personal housekeeper for the winter. I don\u2019t even have a working sink! What \u201cluxury\u201d is that? Don\u2019t even get me started on the security systems. I\u2019m being watched 24/7, can\u2019t have company over, and have had to study every blind spot just to have my best friend stay the night. This isn\u2019t luxury. This is a prison. This will never be my home. When I\u2019m home I should be free to be me.",

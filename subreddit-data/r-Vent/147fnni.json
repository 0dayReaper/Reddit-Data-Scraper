I feel so embarrassed that I\u2019m basically the only one in my peer group with no friends . It\u2019s so depressing watching people my age hang out and have fun while I\u2019m in my room 24/7 crying or listening to music . I hate how my life is . I hate how It\u2019s probably gonna be like this for the rest of my life .",

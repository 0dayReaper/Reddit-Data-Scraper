    "postText": "This is basically a complaint about how much they effect my everyday life now. \n\nThey were one of my online best friends of 2 years. We\u2019re both minors, with an age gap of about 2 years me being older. Over those 2 years we did anything to stay in contact. We were inseparable even after not talking for months we\u2019d bounce right back as if we never left. \n\nIn April, I was going through one of the darkest times in my life. Keep this in mind throughout this whole thing. I was contemplating doing things that can\u2019t be undone very often. On April 13th I vented to them about these thoughts and they wrote so much about how they needed me and promised they\u2019d never leave. That night I had a dream I liked them romantically. Waking up the next morning I jumped on that, completely aware that this could end horribly and that it\u2019s likely the feelings were just my imagination. I told them to get it over with and they swore everything was the same. The next day they happened to confess they felt the same! We were so \u201chappy\u201d for at least 2 days before my mental health went down again. We went on a break because they didn\u2019t want the commitment but promised they\u2019d be back. They never came back. They broke up with me blaming me for every single thing wrong. Saying they were never happy with me and never had romantic feelings in the first place.\n\nA few weeks after, I was looking over things and realized THEY were the ones in the wrong. They just had fun victimizing themselves and saying that\u2019s what I was doing. They told their friends I was forcing them to do things they were uncomfortable with. (I spoke with these friends, they said the screenshots my ex sent were really confusing because my ex brought the ideas that were \u201cuncomfortable\u201d for them up in the first place.)\n\nI have a new girlfriend now and I love her to death because she\u2019s patient and reassuring. She knows what I\u2019ve been through and is trying her best to help me. It\u2019s just every little thing reminds me of my ex. Songs, places (including my own bedroom which makes things tough), outfits, even certain words bring back horrible memories where I threw my heart away. It gives me severe anxiety every time and even panic attacks before. \n\nI just really needed to get this out.",

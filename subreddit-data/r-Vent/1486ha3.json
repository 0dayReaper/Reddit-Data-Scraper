If someone i like comes talk to me ill be 100% sure they are going to misunderstand something i say.\n\nWhatever i do im 100% sure that they worst is going to happen and it does. I am so tired. I've always been unlucky. And telling me \"YOU ARE SO LUCKY\" just to try to proove your point isn't going to help and it only makes you delusional to my eyes.\n\n\nThe title is \"of beeing\", im so unlucky that this app doesn't make u change it.",

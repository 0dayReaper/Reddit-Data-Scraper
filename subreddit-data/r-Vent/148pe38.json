    "postText": "So I love birthdays, not my birthday bit I love making people happy on their birthdays. So I made a new group of friends after I was going through some issues and lost my old ones. For all of their birthday's I got these new friends special inside joke gifts, ordered a few weeks in advanced, made birthday posts for them, wished them happy birthday a million times. All but one of their birthday's is before mine and we all have ours insanely close together. Anyways my birthday was last week and I wasn't expecting anything just maybe a happy birthday cause I don't really like the whole gift thing for my birthday, and I don't even talk about my birthday but my best friend who is in the group talks about my birthday constantly she is was more excited than me. And just an FYI my friends and I all know about everyone's birthdays months in advanced. So fast forward to my birthday and I see my friends in the usual place before school and they're all talking and I walk up and they just say hey, and we all talk about a final we have or something idk. And my best friend comes up and practically screams haply birthday, and passes me a gift. All my other friends do is ask if it was my birthday and when I reply yes they just change the topic to the Spanish final. I had my best friend over that night and she told me that when she talked to everyone later while I was talking to my teacher they didn't even have any remorse. Almost a week later now and still no apology and I'm supposed to see one of the friend's that forgot and never apologized for their birthday this weekend, I bought her gift 2 weeks in advanced and it's all wrapped up right now but I don't want to go and see everyone and give her the gift. So would it be wrong if I don't show up and don't give her the gift?",

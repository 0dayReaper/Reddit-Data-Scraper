    "postText": "i am 37 years old. I suffer from Crohn's disease and schizoaffective psychosis. I've never had a girlfriend or a boyfriend. I worked one day in a car wash, one day in a pizzeria, three days in a factory and one month as a courier. I have always been quiet and introverted. I spend my days alone. I don't have siblings. I don't want to be part of the system. I don't want to work. don't ask me what I do for a living. I'm just living. I just exist.",

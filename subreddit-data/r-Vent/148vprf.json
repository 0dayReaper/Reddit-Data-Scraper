    "postText": "This is all coming to a head right now, but it's been building up for a while. I work 2 jobs but hate my main job. I hate the environment, both socially and physically, and come home from work asking myself why I'm doing this. I feel a pressure to stay as my boss is very well known in the industry and can make a few calls to make it impossible to work anywhere.\n\nI hate my body. I've always struggled with self image, and it's come to a peak now that I'm back in the gym and realize I've lost so much strength and figure. People have been commenting on it and it only makes me feel worse.\n\nI can't express myself. I suck at communicating, let alone telling people how I feel. I feel an immense pressure to please others at the expense of myself. I haven't been able to tell my girlfriend, parents or friends how I feel as I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings or feel like a burden. I also feel a responsibility to be the person anyone can turn to.\n\nI'm stuck. Comment or don't, I just really need to vent right now. I've been stuck in my room for 2 hours doing nothing but listening to music and sitting at my computer.",

Don\u2019t overlook that and don\u2019t refuse them the opportunity to be there for you. I always appreciate when friends give me that chance. \n-\tTherapy could help with that last one. It\u2019s a skill to learn to communicate effectively and part of that comes from first understanding and unpacking the extent of your emotions, so that you can better convey them. \n\nIt can be overwhelming at times to confront all these things at once, so maybe pick one and tackle it by itself first. Then pick another once you\u2019ve gained some traction on the first one. And don\u2019t be afraid to lean on people in your life - that\u2019s why they are there.",

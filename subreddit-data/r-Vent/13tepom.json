It\u2019s easy to spot other people in an abusive relationship and you like to think you can spot when you\u2019re in one too, but when you do find out, you refuse to accept because it 1) makes you feel stupid but 2) means you have to go through the grieving process of letting them go. Some people would rather be in an abusive relationship than alone because loneliness is so crippling too. That\u2019s just my experience and my reflection having gotten out of one now. There are many different reasons.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: Divorces are expensive. I don\u2019t know OP\u2019s financial situation but that could put them in a bind.",

Because he won\u2019t understand why some stuff that\u2019s just a joke or funny, or a normal thought he shares etc. I\u2019d actually really uncomfortable for most and traumatic for kids to hear and see from their own guardian or an adult in general. I know sadly of a dad who got into the same in one of my cases. Long story short\u2026 he made it a reality with the family dogs and guess who ended up bearing witness to it and asked to try on many occasions. They were 7, 8, and 14. The oldest got into it too thinking it was normal by that point also in front of the younger too.\n\nAgain I know that seems very outlandish, but I have so much experience around severe sex related addictions when it gets to this point it\u2019s so unpredictable. \n\nWhen people are in that deep and especially if they aren\u2019t the ones recognizing it\u2019s an issue or wanting to fix it, I mark it as a lost cause and don\u2019t associate.",

I guarantee he is only dragging you down. Is there no part of you willing to let go of him and move on? I'm guessing you haven't been in a lot of healthy relationships and I know that before getting into a healthy relationship it can feel like it's impossible and you can never have that but trust me you CAN. You can at least find a person who cares and is actually trying. There are millions of better people out there who can provide what he does without any of the bullshit and abuse.",

This is probably a childhood thing that either lay dormant because he knows it's deviant. Or he couldn't act on before because this stuff just wasn't as easily accessible. I can't say for sure what it is. Maybe he jerked off a dog. Or let a dog lick peanut butter off his balls. Or wacked his little pud while watching 2 dogs in the neighborhood. Or it could be something even more sinister. Maybe he was forced to do something with a dog. Older brother? Neighborhood bully? \n\nYou won't know any of this until you get BOTH OF YOU some help. That means individual therapy for him and couples therapy for both of you. Don't give up on him because if you do, it won't stop him from doing what he's doing.",

You know dogs bark for a reason. They knew if something was up or wrong. My dog barks to ppl with negative energies and you shouldn't take that for granted.",

            "comment": "Hey, so I read your post history. \nI know you're here to vent, but if you want a strangers viewpoint, here's one. \n\nYou seem like an intelligent person with a deep connection to your emotions, what's appropriate to get from your partners emotions and responses, and the right idea of what you should expect in what's /supposed/ to be a romantic relationship with someone you love.\nYou KNOW what's good for your own emotional and mental wellbeing AND the emotional and mental wellbeing of your partner; and yet you're dealing with the most childlike, emotionally detached/emotionally ignorant, selfishly unconcerned, mentally damaging, and now he has unreasonably sexually deviant fantasies of beastiality/zoophilia. A persons actions absolutely reflects their mental wellbeing, and will absolutely project onto his relationships, especially the ones where he feels like he's in total control. He can abuse those relationships like he's doing to you. He'll do what he calls \"venting\", which is most likely just  gaslighting you, and destroying your self-esteem/mental/emotional health until you feel like he's the only one that'll ever love you/care about you, which he obviously doesn't. \nIf a man doesn't think his girl is the most beautiful girl to ever take his heart, then she's not with the right man. If a man doesn't (at least nearly) cry while his bride walks down the aisle when he first sees her, then he doesn't deserve her love. \nPeople who are emotionally mature enough to feel that way, to love with their whole heart and put in the utmost effort to keep their partner happy; those are the ones we should let our hearts ache over if something went wrong. \nThe man you're describing, he's simply just a child. He's a parasite leeching all of your energy, your self-esteem/confidence/respect, your money, your families money. He's draining you, not taking control of his needs, and destroying you with his toxic behaviors and unreasonable expectations, and now he's disgusting you with that awful fetish.. \n\nIf he doesn't feel privileged, blessed, and like he just won the marathon of life by marrying you, then he is NOT worth your time or your tears. \nYou have a mature understanding of how relationships are supposed to work. You are obviously wise enough to realize that the way you're being treated is at best damaging, and at worst, grounds to leave him and have no contact with him ever again. \n\nDon't let him keep you down. You sound like a real catch who could offer a lot to the right man that'll treat you like the right woman. \n\nBless your heart... Reddit fam is here for you.",

It was one of the big reasons I didn't fight him when he told me he was divorcing me and getting together with a younger woman. I found it absolutely disgusting.",

I said \u201cI have 1 more set to go\u201d so I finish the set then grab some paper towels and equipment spray to clean the equipment , I wipe it down while she\u2019s standing there, staring at me like I just killed someone, I just brushed it off and walked away. And then she shouts, and I mean properly shouts \u201cdon\u2019t think you\u2019ll get anything out of this creep\u201d. Everyone started staring at me like I\u2019m some type of fucking weirdo, I walked away and decided to do some boxing to let\u2019s some anger out.\nRuined my day tbh \ud83d\ude14",

Chalk it up to some chick having a bad day and forgetting how to respect the people around her.\nWhen something like that is said so unbelievably out of nowhere.... she's probably directing her anger about someone else at the wrong person.\nSorry you were on the receiving end.\nDon't let it ruin your day. You're not a creep, you're a boss killing leg day.",

I feel like some girls jump to conclusions. cause is there actual creeps in the gym, sometimes yes. But not every dude that walks by or makes casual conversation or interact with you is a creep.\n\nI would honestly be happy and thankful for the person who used an equipment before me cleaned it off, its gym etiquette and polite. (Plus it would kill time for germaphobe me cleaning the equipment myself haha), but seriously sounds like shes directing her anger at the wrong person.\n\nMaybe she had a creepy person harass her in the gym prior and now she has a pov that every dude in the gym out there gonna do the same, thus jumping to conclusions",

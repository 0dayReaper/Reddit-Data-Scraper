    "postText": "Today is my birthday, I went to olive garden ( My favorite restaurant ) I invited my parents and a close friend of mine. My friend walked in the restaurant with a godamn laptop and headphones, And pretty much refused to talk to me while playing some game. I had dinner and tried to look past it and have a good time. Half way through he got up and said \"it's been good man I gotta go\" and he left. My parents a few minutes later thought that him leaving meant they should leave aswell. So they left and a sat there for a good ten minutes, then I    paid and got in my car, I just sat there crying for a while. Then I went home, right now I'm just sitting here typing this, honestly man it feels like no one cares about you sometimes. I just wish some people weren't such fuckheads. (Fyi my parents were very respectful about it, I could've said something)",

I could never do such thing to anyone, not even my enemy (if I had one).   \n\n\nI hope OP (and everyone who are in the same shoes) finds real friends to enjoy time spent together.  \n\n\nBirthdays should be special by making you the happiest person on Earth that day. Yet they made you feel misarable. You definitely didn't deserve this.  \n\n\nSomeone else mentioned that you're actually too young for this, since I'm pretty sure you'll be able to find people who will appreciate you and your time.",

After re-reading the comment I realize I completely misread that.\n\nI live in the states, and at least in my friend group, when it's someone's birthday, the birthday person will invite whoever wants to come to have dinner with them. It is sort of an unspoken tradition that whoever can afford it, all chip in a few bucks to cover the birthday person's bill- but it's never expected that you chip in and we never make people feel obligated. And of course whenever I've invited people to eat out for dinner on my b-day, I always come prepared to pay for my meal.",

I know when the month is coming but I start trying to avoid the calendar and such during the month hoping to forget what day it is when my bday comes every year. While I was married my wife would forget and if she remembered it would be the day of and she would leave me in the house alone while she would speed to Walmart or target and buy a few things, all of which can always all be gotten within arms reach. Like I have gone and seen what she got me then turned my head to the left and seen the other thing then turned around and saw the other thing. She would hand it to me in the store bag with the tags on. Always the wrong size and never my style lol.\n\nNow that I am single I have no one to spend it with. My mom will text me. Sometimes I fantasize about having at least the half assed celebration treatment like you got but this is a stern reminder that either way people suck ass.\n\nBut if it helps at all, happy birthday!",

That just shows you that he came for a free meal and that he doesn't value you. Find a way to bring YOURSELF joy, eothout involving others.

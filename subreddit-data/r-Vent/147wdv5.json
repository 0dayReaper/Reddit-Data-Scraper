    "postText": "So me and my girlfriend have been dating for about 6 going on 7 months now and recently her and her mom opened a drive-in together, and ever since then we haven\u2019t really been able to see each other, unless I go and help out at the drive-in. She doesn\u2019t get home till like 3 am most nights so I\u2019m not able to spend time with her after work and she has Hyperinsomia so she sleeps in till 3 and she gets to work at 5 so I have no time to see her before work either. And our days off never really match up either and I work a closing shift so I don\u2019t get out till 10pm.  After my job got some new people we got a closer for one of the days off I work temporarily so we were going to try and hang out with each other, we are limited to how long we can see each other since I had a family birthday party later in the day and again she didn\u2019t wake up till 3pm, so I asked if she wanted to at least grab late lunch and she said yeah, but then later said she had to get her dog from the groomers, basically giving us 0 time for us to actually spend time with each other. I got sad and told her how I\u2019ve been just sad that I can\u2019t ever see you anymore and it\u2019s been taking a toll on me, and I\u2019m tired of just seeing you at the drive-In because I can\u2019t hug you or kiss you. And she just texted back IDC. Ik she had stuff going on that day such as her leaving her purse at her job, and she\u2019s been sad about sleeping so much, and she\u2019s been over worked too, so it was a combination of things but it just hurt so much when I\u2019ve taken days off of work, and scrambled to get someone to cover my shift and even when I had only dollars in my account taking her someone to go eat just so we can spend time with each other, just to hear her say she doesn\u2019t care that she can\u2019t see me. I told her that it hurt for her to say that and she just said she does care but she\u2019s stressed out about other things, which I understand but it still hurts that you said that and you didn\u2019t even say sorry. Idk if I\u2019m sounding petty, just I\u2019m more of a physical guy when it comes to my love and when I can\u2019t have that physical connection with the women I love it\u2019s painful.",

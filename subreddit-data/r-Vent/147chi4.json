I am a mf wife not no hookups or nothing, will it be so damn hard to just text me like a normal person without bringing up cuddling and all that inappropriate nonsense I don\u2019t feel comfortable talking about that I just want a normal conversation with someone, and when I do tell them that they get offended and ghost/block me. I am so sick of this I just want a normal convo that\u2019s it like normal people.",

I wouldn\u2019t even waste my time talking with them. I even made my profile as private as I could to prevent the unsolicited messages I was getting and people trying to add me as a friends etc. The person I am with now is someone I met by chance while working. He was a regular customer and we shared a love of art and many other things. We also slowly worked from acquaintances to friends to friends that hung out to becoming best friends to dating. Our love just grew each time.",

It just requires you have a bit of patience and to not make it easy for everyone else. Everyone is different of course in what they want, but it\u2019s clear you don\u2019t  want just anybody or everybody, so standards help to eliminate the unnecessary. The best thing you can do is take care of yourself, find and do the things you love, and just find happiness even as a single person. Don\u2019t ever let someone take that away either.",

They see women as a thing to satisfy their sexual needs, but they don\u2019t see us as people. \n\n\nYou can see if that\u2019s true or not in the way they talk to you, the way they don\u2019t respect your boundaries, or the way they expect women to be there in the way they want regardless of what the women feel. It\u2019s surprisingly and scarily rare that they actually care about women as human beings.\n\nIt\u2019s so frustrating. But just protect yourself. Watch the way you\u2019re spoken to\u2014if a \u201cman\u201d ever makes you feel off listen to that feeling. It will save you so much pain.",

Toxic masculinity is too popular. Like some need to take a chill pill and not be misogynistic. It seems like no man can carry a conversation without mentioning sexual intimacy. No i do not want to see your wiener i would like to have a normal conversation about anything like tell me about your day or your hobbies. Idk what way you swing but i have always had more meaningful conversations and relationships with women. \nSide note: glad you know you are wifey material. Do not let incel get you down. You are a baddie\ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffb",

My point is that you don't choose correctly who you talk to. Most of the random men sliding into people's dms will be in it for a hook up. You don't really hear about many success stories that started with \"he slid into my dms and told me I'm hot\" and for a reason. Also watch what kind of info you're putting out about yourself - not saying it's your fault for attracting jerks, they gravitate towards any woman with a pulse, but there are certain things that make them think you'd be into it. Also really check on them before you reply, really look into what profiles they have, what they post, how they look (I'm not talking about beauty but if he has a fake rolex and looks like a Tate wannabe he will 100% suck and there's a ton of other physical choices that are immediate red flags). There are plenty of good men out there, but they don't spend their time sliding into women's dms, they're busy with their jobs, hobbies and friends/family. You best bet to meet a good guy would be to get into a hobby where you can meet someone likeminded or through common friends.",

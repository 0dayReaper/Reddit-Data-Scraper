    "postText": "Take Facebook for example. Facebook used to be posts from your friend's/groups only. This is what Facebook was supposedly found on. Then it turned into displaying an ad within your feed every few posts. Now Facebook Feeds are 40% Ad's, 40% Reels and 20% what I actually signed up to see.\n\nThe Reels are always garbage with no way to disable them. You're basically forced to see glimpses of crap you don't want to.\n\n- Silly \"Life Hacks\"\n- People overlaying themselves on top of another video making fake reactions\n- A video that may be entertaining if there wasn't shit music blasting at 200% over the original audio. For example the annoying  \"Oh no. Oh no.\" track. \n\nI can't believe this is entertaining to people.\n\nThis all seemed to start after TikTok was released. Every social media company decided to find a way to integrate short videos into their platform. Amazing how one shitty mobile app changed the internet forever.",

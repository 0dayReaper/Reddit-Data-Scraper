    "postText": "basketball. basketball is all i want to do in life. but i suck. i can\u2019t dribble. i can\u2019t absorb contact. i\u2019m slow. i have no reason why i should be bad. i\u2019m a pretty decent height, 5\u20198 at 13, but i just can\u2019t do anything. i just got back from basketball camp and i performed horribly, i got yelled at for doing bad in drills, people called me names for doing bad during the games. all i want is to make the league, but i know i won\u2019t. i probably won\u2019t even make the high school team. i finished off the games with 2 turnovers from travels, 2 misses with 1 airball, 1 assist, and then 0 points. it sucks to be terrible at the thing i love. i practice daily, i put in the work, and i always play good when practicing alone. but when other people come into play, i\u2019m terrible. i probably won\u2019t make a single point for the rest of camp, hell i probably won\u2019t even get passed to again. i\u2019m so tired of it. but whatever. it doesn\u2019t matter. i wasn\u2019t going to make the league anyway. whatever",

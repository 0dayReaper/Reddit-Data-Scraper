    "postText": "I (21M) met last year a girl I thought was the genuine love my life. Time slowed down it seemed and she was my everything. We bonded insanely well and moved in together two months in and from there it was great. Almost a year in and we lose the house because her parents wanted to get rid of her. The entire time I lived with her she never worked, but I put school and everything on hold to work multiple jobs. She wanted to get engaged so we did after 8 months. I was completely devoted to her even when she still had contact with her ex's family and actively visited them often. I never once thought about leaving her. We had to go to my parents house for a while and it was a small town with hardly any work. All that was available was part time and I decided I wanted to finish my last semester of school to get a solid job at the bank while I worked a part time. She had a lot of problems with that, but I wanted to get the job I actually wanted. I had gained a lot of weight by this point and she had ran my depression through the roof. She got into an argument with my parents about how they run the house and she left to stay at her brother's house in a bigger town to make more money. She wanted me to leave my family and disassociate from them and I couldn't, I wanted both in my life. At least just my brother. That wasn't good enough. She borderline ghosted me for a month, sometimes taking days to respond only to break up with me over text after a year and sent me a picture of a guy she had been seeing.\n\nI have been cheated on 2, now 3 times and this was the final straw. I told her to come get her shit. Now that she's gone I'm left with this huge pit of loss that would hurt, and sometimes still does, for a few months. I genuinely feel like all the women in my area cheat and only want money. And the only release I get is my time at the gym. I've made great progress with my weight, but still have to wait for school to finish before I can get the bank job I've been waiting for. And worse, I'm just alone. I have friends and family, but I miss that connection with someone else, facing the world together and someone I can give my heart and devotion to. The gym has been my only therapy, but I could use advice if you guys could throw any my way.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ll probably just be repeating the same advice that you\u2019ll get from other people, but now is the time to explore who you are and who you want to be and work on yourself. Focus on getting through school and working on yourself physically and mentally. Seems like you\u2019re doing great with the physical workout, which is great! Now it\u2019s time to make sure that you do really well in school and develop your hobbies and start networking and building up your skill sets so that you can actually land a good job. Also, your friends and family are (hopefully) a lot more important than you may think now, they\u2019re gonna be a vital support while you parse through the feelings that you discussed here and they\u2019ll be able to be a lot more helpful than a random stranger on the internet. You\u2019re not alone in this struggle unless you purposefully make yourself alone.\n\nIt\u2019ll suck, but you should put relationships on the back burner for awhile while you properly establish yourself and get your life going. Once you\u2019re actually in the swing of things and have a steady job and living situation, then it would be a good time to continue on looking for relationships. Hopefully with your past experiences (really sorry about those man, those women suck) you\u2019ll be able to focus on the qualities that you actually want in a partner and move forward with those in mind.",

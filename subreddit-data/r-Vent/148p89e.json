I know I\u2019m still young and others have worse problems than me but they have been on my mind a lot lately. A little background info about us, we\u2019ve known each other since the start of elementary and it\u2019s normal for us to stop talking sometimes, almost every other year we just stop communicating and it\u2019s never been a big problem. About a year and a half ago they stopped responding to my texts, this was after they moved schools too so I couldn\u2019t just talk to them at school. I tried everything to contact them but ended up giving up after two months of no response. After giving up I kept having dreams of us hanging out at our old school where we first met, around July of last year the dreams came to an end and it only left me more confused than ever. I should really get over it by now but I can\u2019t, i have no one to talk to at home, so for over a year now I\u2019ve been writing down my thoughts in a journal but it just makes me feel worse. The friend is still active on social media but I don\u2019t think they would appreciate me contacting them after such a long time, what should I do?",

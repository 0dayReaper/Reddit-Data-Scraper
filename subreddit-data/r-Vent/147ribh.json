People use each others bodies for sexual gratification, and it seems really shallow and sad, how we can't be intimate and love each other with our hearts, but with our bodies. It's sad, and people seem to only be able to get close to each other that way, out of fear of being hurt, and scared to get close and emotionally invested. I love sex just as much as the next guy, and I'm a sucker for the beauty of women and lust and all that, but it seems too sacred to just give away as a cheap substitute for the real thing. Ersatz. Idk seems really cold hearted, and tragic. I can't enjoy sex unless I'm emotionally connected with the person, and trust them and feel safe with them, and know they won't criticize me or anything. Makes my heart sink when I'm at clubs seeing everyone get fucked up just to talk to each other, hoping not to go to sleep alone that night, longing for a connection while not actually trying to get that connection. There's only one band in the world that seems to capture all of that, and it's Deftones. When I hear everyone talking about the people they meet and fuck when they go out, it sounds fun, but also sounds dark and sad to me, just using each others bodies, trying to distract themselves. We're all looking for the same way, but take short cuts to get there, and wonder why they're not happy. I wanna fuck every hot girl I see, but I know I can't, and I hate just seeing them as sex objects, but it's my biology, and I can't help it, but I know lust is not fulfilling, it's human connection and real warm intimacy with someone that matters to you, and hoping the feeling is mutual.",

By the end of the wedding, I was a little buzzed and thought about asking him if i could come over. So happy i didn't though. Don't miss anything about that relationship except the sex. Longest I've gone without was over a year. \u0130 think this time around I'll hit a new record. \n\n*Hugs*",

Your not alone in your cravings.\n\nThe worst part us you see ppl all the time with someone or everyone talking about sexual escapades and just drives u up the the wall. Eventually self satisfaction looses all it fun. Been over 4 year since the last time got to be intimate.  Hmmm how long of time has to pass so u can be considered a born again virgin I wonder lol.",

            "comment": "male here, but hun I relate so hard.\n\nWife called for a divorce back in September. my sex drive had been low because of how stressed I was caring for so much and being pulled in so many directions. there were a number of small matters about our sex life she ended up blowing out of proportions and denying how much of it stemmed from her not communicating her needs that I begged her regularly to tell me about. mix that with her reasons for a divorce and moving on to her girlfriend, saying she wanted a female partner but couldn't rule out sex with a guy in the future but saying she couldn't be free in a marriage with a guy (when we talked heavily about the topic and eventually opened up our marriage 2 years prior because I wanted her to explore her bisexuality that I'd been well aware of for years.... it's a lot of shit).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: her reasons were flippant, I was at an all time low and constant mental breakdowns. now I'm doing substantially better, working out again, feeling better with my body, and my sex drive has not been this high in YEARS. and I have absolutely NO WHERE to go with it other than the obvious self-love.\n\nI'm still probing the edges of the modern dating pool, since I'd been dating/married to her for 10 years, highschool to mid 20's, and have no fucking clue what I'm getting into. But I have a better idea of what I need in a partner, what I'm looking for, what I will and will not compromise on. The sucky thing is knowing that I'm probably not going to be intimate with anyone until something solidifies there.\n\nWhat my ex did really fucked me up in a very not-okay way. Feeling my sexual drive this strong, growing emotionally with therapy, and doing things for myself for the first time in years has helped to affirm my sexuality and my need/want of it, and has made me better for it all... now I've just gotta wait until things align to give this energy to a new person in a better relationship.",

And now I\u2019m postpartum with a newborn so it\u2019s just not the time for me. But man, months without sex is really making me lose my mind. I am deep into some fandoms and basically fall asleep reading smut every night and dreaming of when I will get to fuck someone again. It\u2019s really crazy it\u2019s such a deep craving for me, I\u2019ve always been like this. This is the longest I\u2019ve went without sex in years and I can feel the need in my bones.

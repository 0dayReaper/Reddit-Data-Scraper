    "postText": "Are you fucking kidding me?\n\nThe second my dad's in the ground you're just going to bring some dude over to live with us? I told you \"No, I don't want him here\" so why the fuck did you even ask me how I felt if you didn't care. But yeah, fuck my feelings, just like you and dad decided to be addicts instead of raising your kids, nice job by the way, you got one of your son's killed.\n\nAnd you know what, fine. Go ahead. Fuck it, just bring some dude to live with us now that my dad's dead. But seriously?? FUCKING HIM ON THE COUCH WHILE IM UPSTAIRS IN MY ROOM??\n\nLady what the fuck is wrong with you. Jesus Christ. Nice to know that still after all these years you'll always have someone else to prioritize over your kids.\n\nGod I can't wait to get back to work and get the fuck out of this house.\n\nEdit: Thank you guys for all the supportive comments. I didn't expect my rant to get so much attention. For context, I'm 17, CPS won't help me, (I don't know why, I think I'm too old or something), and I haven't got anywhere else to stay. Honestly it's fine. I've just got one more year here and then I'm going off to college, out of state so I can keep away from her until she decides she wants to be a proper mom again. Thank you all again, you've been very, very kind.",

She dragged my brother and I through so much fucked up shit and neglected us in any and every way you could possibly imagine. \n We didn't go to school, we never saw a doctor. We did not go to the dentist. We lived in the back of a truck so she could drive around get high and rob people's houses with her boyfriend so they could support their drug habit. They often did not get us food so we would have to steal food from gas stations to survive. They convinced us that police and any other authority figured who could help us were bad and would take us away from the hell we were already living and somehow bring us to somewhere worse.\n\n  It sounds like your family has put you through your own share of trauma. The only way not to live an angry and miserable life and for you to have a chance at happiness and success in life is for you to become indifferent to your mother's actions. I am not saying you need to forgive her or that you don't have the right to be hurt or angry but wondering why she didn't try to give you a better life and allowed you to suffer and why she couldn't love her children enough to get her life together and be the mother you needed her to be you may never be able to get the answer and the closure you need and you can't carry that chip on your shoulder and be successful. I made that mistake and I lost so much life with my heart filled with hate and anger and spiraling out of control, I will never get that time back.\n\n   You have to realize that your Outlook and success in life is all on you. Forget her live every day finding out how to make it. Start figuring it out now because where you end up 15-20 years down the line depends on it. I am sorry for your loss and I wish you well",

Of course they're not going to step in just because your mother decided to engage in a relationship with someone new. The fact that you tried to ruin whatever she had going on because you didn't like it by inviting the possibility of criminal charges being brought shows more about your character than hers.

Once you have kids, you don't get to run off to Vegas and decide \"I don't care about the kids anymore, I just want to party\".\n\nAll my life I've worked to pay their bills, half of that money being used for drugs, my fucking tuition money, given to them from my grandma, all blown away on drugs.\n\nI have been nice with her, I've been calm with her, I've been angry with her. No matter how I try to talk to this woman, she won't change. I swear to God I've tried everything.\n\nThey took my money, my brother, and my sanity. My mother grieving is one thing, I don't care if she wants to fool around with some dude, keep shooting up god knows what, and get herself killed like my dad did, but after watching my brother die in my own fucking arms, finding my dad's rotting body all alone, and going to trap houses at 14 to make sure no one robs my parents while high, IM DONE. All I want now is for her to keep her life away from mine. I don't even expect her to buy me clothes, gifts, food, nothing. Just give me a house to sleep in for one more year, and keep your shit show out of my life. That's all I want dude.\n\nSorry that's really long, Im just super pissed right now.",

You had every opportunity to end up like your parents, but it sounds like you didn\u2019t and GOOD FOR YOU MAN! Get out of there asap. Cut ties with your family, even if it\u2019s hard. You don\u2019t want them constantly hounding you for money or guilt tripping you to come back home. I\u2019ve dealt with a fair share of drug addicts in my family and in my job, and they don\u2019t change unless they want to. Until they want that, and make a REAL change, do not go back to them. Good luck man, keep your head up. Try your hardest to fight thro this and get yourself out of there. You have every right to be pissed off.",

My dad is an asshole and i lives in a foster family for over 10 years where i had to endure bullshit, but you take the cake. I can somewhat understand how you must feel, but certainly not to the same extent. Im extremely sorry, if i could id take you in my home so you wouldnt have to deal with that until you find a place. Youre doing the right thing right now by not wanting anything to do with her until you can move out. I dont think ive met someone with such a troubled childhood in the past, and im living with someone who's been kidnapped and raped several times. I hope everything will go well for you from the bottom of my heart. If you ever need anything, i dont mind sending some money from time to time if you message me privately to help out.

It\u2019s entirely science-based with numerous case study references. Both nature (heredity) and nurture (trauma) are the primary contributors. \n\nNo, a parent shouldn\u2019t have sex in a common living area (in general, IMO, but especially not with a child being home). Many parents simply suck though; I\u2019m sure some sober ones would do this so addiction isn\u2019t necessarily the cause. Manic episodes lead to hyper sexuality in bipolar people. Do they choose to have a mental disorder?\n\nOP\u2019s mom is obviously a terrible parent, and I feel for him. Venting is totally healthy. I just took issue with \u201cchose to be an addict\u201d. It took me months to believe that it wasn\u2019t a choice (I\u2019m a psychologist); I initially felt it meant poor self-control, but I have plenty of that in every other aspect of my life. I\u2019ll go months without alcohol, then have 1 drink, be fine, and suddenly I\u2019m back to being blackout drunk, unable to stop and hating myself.

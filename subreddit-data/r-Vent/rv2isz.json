The system isn\u2019t perfect but it\u2019s the best one we have atm. Bootlicker would mean that i kids ass, I just stated a fact that\u2019s, completely different:)\n\nI agree that the mom sounds weird but she\u2019s not breaking any law end of. You literally wanted to beat his mom I don\u2019t think that is the best solution either but I ta by our opinion and that\u2019s fine:)",

You can\u2019t have a camera in private areas like a bedroom or bathroom. Also if the kid masturbates in their own bed then the mom has child porn so even now at 13 the mom could be committing a felony. The kid doesn\u2019t have many rights at the moment but they have a right not to be filmed in the privacy of their room. Honestly the mom getting her ass beat and learning a lesson is the merciful outcome. Truly the kid should lawyer up get emancipated and sue the fuck out of their creepy parents then move out and never contact again. What do you think is worse for the mom getting a fist to the face or never seeing their estranged child ever again?",

Then maybe there are some other devices that you could buy to detect those. Idk.\n\nAlso, are there any objects in there that aren't yours/that you haven't seen before? The cameras are propably made to look like regular objects and are likely located in places that give a broad view to your entire room.\n\n[edit] Btw If your parents are okay going this far to invade your privacy, I think you should check your phone (apps, settings etc.) in case they are spying what you do on your phone. It's also possible they track you (by your phone or otherwise). I don't want you to be any more paranoid, but you could do a little extra digging just to make sure.

The sooner you get over this, the better your relationship will get. And trust me, mothers can be a bit crazy, but they always want the best for you. Keep that in mind. Sorry you are one more human with a crazy mother, but please just keep in mind that after all, she is your mother, she feeds you still. All you need to do is not have fun in a bad way, don't lie and work. Honesty is too good man. I learned that myself from the same situation.

I met a family once that used this app that tracks their location all the time for all the family to see, and all seemed to use it consensually which I did not understand. But this is not even as bad as a camera in your child's room. Regardless, I hope you can find the camera and tape it or destroy it. When confronted about it, try to calmly explain how if she wants you to be honest, she can't expect it out of you while spying on you, and you will only be honest when she respects your privacy. You also have human dignity and are too old for a camera. If you have to cry, you can do it beforehand so you are more collected when it comes the time to talk about it. It's hard to do if you're in your position because you have no power in your household. Good luck to you with this situation! Stay strong! I believe that everything will turn out okay in the end. When you're older you can laugh about it later so don't worry too much.",

I mean maybe she is lying XD\n\nMy dad used to tell me that he saw me on a camera when I was a kid in case I was acting suspicious so I backtrack and catch myself in a lie. Even though there was no camera anywhere XD\n\nThere are ways to detect cameras (you can google them) so if you do find it you can just open it up and break something on the inside. Disconnect a wire or something. You should also figure out if the camera has a recording function so it doesn't record you tinkering with it. If it does then you can find the sd card that is in it and delete the footage using a card reader or just by placing it into your phone. This should be a foolproof way for the camera to stop working and the blame not being put directly on you.\n\nYou can also dunk it into some water if it is small. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand placing some tape over it is good enough too I guess but it all depends on how would your mother react to it. \n\nThe best way would be to act like you don't know where the camera is and place something in front of it so that it obscures the cameras vision. Mind that the something should be an item that would normally be there and that would look like you put it there haphazardly. \n\nThen it would be up to your mother to give away the camera position by forbidding you to place things in front of it. She won't do that if she thinks you don't know where the camera is in fear you don't tinker with it. \n\nStill I think the best way is to break any and all cameras that could have been placed in your bedroom without obvious evidence you did it. Depends on how technologically savvy your mom is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso,\n\nAsk yourself: What would be a reason for your mother not to trust you and to put a camera in your room? Maybe she is invading your privacy but if she has a valid reason to do it then I would support her decision. It all depends on context I don't really have.",

Confront her about it and tell her that it bothers you. Sometimes honesty is the best policy.\n\n \n\nAlso keep in mind that people telling you how it is illegal and stuff don't care about you or your relationship with your parents. \n\nYou said you are Arab... Pretty sure the police won't give 2 shits about a parent placing a camera in the childs room even if it was \"illegal\" and would just say you are acting out. And besides do you really want to do something like that to your family. I know the mentality of middle eastern people... I might not be from the middle east but the Balkans are pretty close and the people have similar mentalities XD\n\nPeople who are talking about law and criminal charges don't know how the world really works. They probably think that a camera is grounds for taking a child away from a family and making them live in an orphanage or something similar. A life in an orphanage is 10 times worse then life with your parents. Seems to me like you do understand that. Just don't let people convince you otherwise because I see a lot of them talking about it.",

I\u2019m willing to bet she thinks she will catch you with a boy, or exploring your own sexuality- and that would allow her to handle it before it becomes a problem. My only other thought is that she may be bluffing about the camera altogether.",

Mine kept their own eyes trained on me and my siblings. As a 34 year old father of a 10 year old son- I let my son make his own mistakes. I was a bad kid, just to spite my parents. I don\u2019t want that from my own son, just respect and unconditional love. I rarely have to get after him for things he does, and he\u2019s pretty well behaved because he\u2019s allowed to be his own person. Best you can do is approach the situation with your mother in a non confrontational manner, and not repeat her mistakes when/if you ever have your own kids. Good luck OP, I know 18 seems a long way away- but it\u2019s a lot closer than you think!",

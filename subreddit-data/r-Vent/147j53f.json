    "postText": "I wish I could feel emotions again when I do \u201cfeel\u201d emotions it\u2019s just when someone says something bad and if I don react I\u2019m weird or mean. \nI wish I wasn\u2019t molested by my older brother. He is the one who caused me to lose my grip of reality as a small child.\nI wish I would\u2019ve just killed myself. My life means nothing. I\u2019ve had 17 attempts since I was 9. Nothing helps. \nI wish I would\u2019ve stopped smoking weed sooner. I wish that one time I smoked wouldn\u2019t have made me lose grip of reality more so Than i have already.\nI used to come home after school hoping my brother would let me in but 9 times out 10 the door was locked and I\u2019d be outside for 5 hours in the cold.",

It's not for me.  now for the worse part my sister is giving my father a very bad time and treating him like shit  my sister always yelling at my dad for no reason for eg  \n\u2022my dad once took some coffee from my sister, (not a problem right) my sister yelled at him for 30 mins.\n\n\u2022my dad like to gather us and talk about memories yet my sister never listens to him and ditch my dad.\n\n\u2022my dad talks to my sister about any topic( no not sexual) my sister skips him.\n\nI don't know what to do everyone hates each other. I really don't hate anyone, but sometimes I want to be just alone, don't wanna talk or anything, just alone. But seriously this has gotten too far. my family no longer talks to each other, or anything.",

    "postText": "No, Jessica, having 8 bodies when you're in 8th grade isn't a \"flex.\" It's terrible. You're not a baddie for sleeping with people when you're just a baby. And these young girls have to stop thinking confidence and exploitation are the same thing. You should wear anything you want *that's reasonable for your age* You are not going to fucking school in a tube top and a mini skirt. You're just a child. You're going to wear awkward jeans and justice tees like I did. And you ain't wearing makeup either. I know social media makes you think you have to be \"sexy\" and grown up and wear makeup, but you're just babies!!\n\nEdit; yes I do realize that adults and social media are the problem but there comes a point where kids no longer look like kids. They look 20 years old sometimes. On one hand you got the teenagers that do not care regardless of how many people tell them to be safe and this and that and they end up getting groomed or kidnapped or molested or God forbid what else; and on the other hand you have the group of teenagers that does care but they just want to feel liberated. Unless you are fully educated on sex and the dangers of online predators, and grooming and whatnot, you absolutely should not be dressing up in incredibly clad clothing to feel liberated. I know some people may disagree with that. I also want to say I am all for teens learning about proper sex, and it is most definitely true that in some parts of the world there are teens out there with a very high body count by the time they're in eighth grade.",

They can access it at the tips of their fingers, you are blaming the wrong people. If an underaged girl is dresses promiscuously, who is buying her those clothes and who is letting her leave the house that way?\n\nEdit: *** I know it's pay per view, my phone auto corrected, but I'm not changing it because I didn't notice it originally and who cares?

I  also don't understand why they think children/\"babies\" should understand the difference between confidence and exploitation when they definitely don't have enough real world experience to know things like that without someone having to tell them.\n\nThe people at fault for these sorts of things are adults. Adults are the problem. I totally understand the frustration, but blaming *literal children* is not going to solve anything. Really, it's just going to add to the problem.",

People who aren\u2019t addicts think it\u2019s insane- but a lot of people I know in recovery relate a lot to it. Idk- just my opinion on S1 and the 2 mini movies or whatever they were one Rue and Jules.\n\nThat said- parents should be honest w kids about dangers and predators and ODs and DUI deaths and fentanyl in all the party drugs and how permanent things you put on the internet are. Kids shouldn\u2019t push themselves out there so much but THEY ARE CHILDREN- THEY DON\u2019T REALIZE THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION. I chased adult men- lucky they had good morals and got themselves right out of those situations.\n\nIt\u2019s not on the kids- it\u2019s the parents. It\u2019s not on Euphoria- it shows a realistic portrayal of addict life, and it\u2019s a show for adults. The actors are adults. It\u2019s on parents and mentors.",

Add it no discipline and we see the end result. I am not partially placing blame on one particular aspect, it's an observation of the workings of the world.

You look for opportunities to have  a very brief conversation , and allow them the opportunity to ask questions. It's even better if you can talk doing an activity together.  By the time they are teenagers, there is no need to have an awkward \" big talk\".",

Have the talk with your kids.\n\nAnd worrying about how many people another person (let alone a child) is having sex with is alarming.\n\nIf my son is going to have sex, I need him to realize that porn is not an accurate depiction of sex and how to have it, I need him to know that he needs to be sure to ask for consent, be protected, make sure she is on birth control, be aware of all options if those methods fail, and to not be sneaky about it.\n\nJust my opinion.",

Why do you think fake IDs work? Teens at that age sometimes do everything in their power to look \u201cadult\u201d, which sometimes means dressing provocatively. So if they succeed that\u2019s not an issue with the observer, that\u2019s the teen acting someway they shouldn\u2019t and giving out false signals. If you saw someone wearing a wedding ring you wouldn\u2019t think \u201cah it\u2019s fake\u201d, you\u2019d just think they\u2019re married. Same way, if you saw someone who looks the same as you and is dressed the way someone your age might, you\u2019re gonna assume it\u2019s a person your age until proved otherwise. However if you know the person is a minor and still say \u201cbut she\u2019s sexy\u201d that\u2019s a different conversation.\n\nTL;DR: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay for minors to dress provocatively and then blame others when they mistake them for people of age.",

I have a very specific memory of a girl who was known around the school for fucking any dude that would talk to her and constantly cheating on any dude she dated (not baseless rumors, she fucked 3 of my close friends just during freshman year, all while she had the same boyfriend) and she was constantly preaching in classes about how girls need to stay pure for marriage and \"if you aren't ready to get pregnant you shouldn't be having sex!\" Meanwhile she had a cervical implant or something due to some birth defect that stopped her from getting pregnant as a side effect. Another girl who slut shamed other girls who were still virgins for dressing up and looking good had had her friends hit her in the stomach and started fights with her boyfriend when she got pregnant to stress herself out and induce miscarriages. The difference isn't that people are fucking less, it's that they're more likely to lie about it. In the past when women decided it was time to fuck they didn't lie about it as often because they waited until they were sure it was the right person, someone who they wouldn't be ashamed about. Now people fuck constantly and lie about it so they don't get labeled badly.",

And they know that, so being told by people much older (or even just slightly older) that they are is frustrating. So this often leads to them feeling they need to prove they aren\u2019t babies by doing adult things.\n\nHonestly I think something that would help (not solve, but help) with this problem, is showing them that we recognize them as more than just a baby, but just as a young person who is intelligent in their own right, with their own thoughts, feelings and views etc.",

But in other instances they are just children. Similarly I hate when people talk to small kids while \"sugaring\" every word. Why can't just talk to them normally?\n\nIt's true that we are all still pretty dumb when we're kids. I was one and can't forget how stupid I could be. That's why adults should help guide kids but at the same time let them make mistakes so they can learn. They shouldn't just brush them off with lines like \"Oh, you're still just a kid!\" and refuse to have a proper, serious discussion. Adults should make an effort to talk to their kids as if they were already adults but also know when they can be goofy and when to be serious.",

He had paid for one of the most expensive dance schools in the entire metroplex.  \nMy fiance and I watched in horror as we saw second and third graders humping the ground, twerking, and grinding the air. Even the kindergarten group had lipstick on and a section where they humped the ground to pop music. And their family is way more wealthy than ours, like we thought those dance classes were gonna be like ballet or something. xD\n\nMy guy just held up his hand to my imminent protest and was like 'Yeah lets tell her &amp; her parents that she did great and leave.' We happened to be busy for every dance recital after that... It's been years now, and she is literally the top in her high school cheer leading and equine competitions, and is a pro with her makeup, better even than me. I mean, I'm pretty sure she's already got a badass tiktok account and stuff at barely 15.  \nShe's already being offered cheer leading scholarships. Life; she'll succeed financially I guess.\n\nHowever my other nieces, which were raised way more conservatively, and are in drama and dance and plays that actually make us laugh and enjoy our time as guests without displaying their sexuality or making anyone feel well...weird, even though they are older than the first example, are having a harder time with college applications and succeeding in life.   \nEven though I believe myself that they are way more talented, way better actresses and can even pull off multiple accents perfectly.   \n(And A students otherwise.)  \nHowever, because they never flaunted their (non-existent) sexuality, they are not making it as far for similar scholarships.\n\nThe problem is the world. The adults. Not the kids.",

So we were just talking and they brought up body counts, I thought they were talking about the murder kind- So when one girl &gt;!(the one I actually know)!&lt; said that she has like 6-8 I was y\u2019know, concerned- But for some reason I was not really surprised, I mean my school isn\u2019t exactly the best place. So when they asked me what my body count was I said 0 because I'm a law abiding citizen and not a murderer. &gt;!(I mean I did drink bud light once because I didn\u2019t know what it was but let\u2019s not talk about that)!&lt;I did say that I was thinking about it because someone was pissing me off &gt;!(for legal reasons that\u2019s a joke)!&lt;and they said something like \u201cso you\u2019re gonna fuck them?\u201d So that made me realize that we were not talking about murder which I was relieved by because I am not standing next to murderers. &gt;!(Im pretty sure the other girl said that she had like 3?? my 7 braincells cant remember stuff that happened a day ago but I can remember stuff from like 6 years ago.)!&lt;So yeah- Also like half of the kids in my school use vapes, that\u2019s incredibly sad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso while we were walking around the girl that I was somewhat friends with said that she did it with someone who was basically an adult and didn\u2019t see anything wrong with it so yeah that\u2019s a thing that I had to hear\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd also maybe don\u2019t call us babies, it reminds me that people don\u2019t take us seriously! :D",

Teenagers are in a world of their own, and adults shouldn\u2019t really impose. On that note, OP, I don\u2019t think an eighth grader would have eight partners, that seems difficult to believe.

There are definite times where the teenager doesn\u2019t know the ramifications of what they\u2019re doing or the danger they\u2019re putting themselves in. But for the most part, I think it\u2019s important to let teens grow up rather than sheltering them. Sheltering them is hardly the answer. \n\nMaybe I would feel differently if I actually saw these situations IRL, but I haven\u2019t been around teenagers since I stopped being one, and don\u2019t have an interest in changing that lol.",

However Minors, myself included, arent necessarily \"showing off\" or \"sexualizing ourselves\" but rather we are sharing our personal experiences in the way we know best. If a minor on tiktok makes a joke about the time them and their consenting partner did it while watching a movie there really isnt any harm to it, its relatable and funny to us. The fact that minors have sex is also something that is generally shunned in society and online, and yes obviously someone having intercourse under the age of 14 needs to rethink their life decisions but I know a lot of people at my age who practice this responsibly and maturely. People need to accept that people can have a sex life under the age of 18 and they are entitled to the freedom of sharing their experiences with others if they choose to do so. This obviously not in a CP media context but rather in stories, rants, jokes etc.\n\nSomeone under the age of 18 has no business posting nudity or sexual content online, however they are fully entitled to share their experiences and joke about a huge part of maturing and puberty. Teenagers have always been sexually active, the only thing that has changed is that now we're online.",

(Omegle is a hellhole) It's not what you're wearing or the actions you display that get you sexually assaulted or groomed. They target you if you are vulnerable, like you have abandonment issues, or trauma, and they specifically go after the kids who DO fall for this stuff. When a kid is too smart, and calls the adult out, the adult perv usually backs off and moves onto another victim. But when a kid doesn't have any emotional support, or hides stuff from their family, then the creepers will swoop. I am not saying that kids should be allowed to dress \"provocatively\", before you accuse me off saying that. I just think the way you're going about this makes you sound sexist and resentful. If you go about shaming kids and talking down to them about how you \"know better\", what makes you think they're going to listen? I get being frustrated over this sort of thing, but I was young once. I know the answer isn't to get mad at the kids and tell them,  \"well, back in my day...\" kids will look up to you if you see them eye-to-eye, and if you talk with them empathetically. I think that's why a lot of them relate to YA novels or teen dramas, because they're not treating you like a baby who needs to be shielded from the horrors of *gasp* SOCIETY! Yeah, these shows and books can be a tad unrealistic, but kids and teens want to feel included in conversations, they want to feel they are able to talk openly about these things with a trusted peer or mentor.",

I literally got cat called in college walking down the road in sweatpants. Things are very dangerous nowadays and young girls and women need to look out for each other. But on the other hand there are some women that do not care and will completely disregard their own safety just to seem cool to sleep with a man 15 years older than them.",

In fact I think we should stop sexualizing children based on what they're wearing. Not all of us are going to go through awkward jeans and t-shirts phases and it isn't necessary. As someone who is demisexual, I can say I do wear makeup and mini skirts but I have absolutely no intention on being sexual. I just think I look good. I don't want people to look at me and think that's what I'm wearing is sexual, again considering I'm a minor. I'm aware there are SOME who do, but that isn't all of us :)",

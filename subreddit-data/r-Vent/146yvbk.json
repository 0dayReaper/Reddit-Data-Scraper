Dear lord, I cannot even put into exact words how horrible I feel ALL OF THE TIME. It has been my reality for so long but I wish it wasn't...I wish I could do anything without worrying about everything. I just look at people sometimes and think \"How can they not worry about what everyone thinks?\". \nI'm such a freak, because currently my heart is beating so fast for no actual reason besides I ahve done something and there is no turning back and I should be happy about it because I wanted to do it for so long! But I still have so many doubts! Fuck, I'd laugh if I wasn't so terrified!",

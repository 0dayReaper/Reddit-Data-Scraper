    "postText": "ESPECIALLY when the characters are supposed to be teenagers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLiterally 4 minutes into the Yellowjackets pilot, a girl is getting fingered by who I am assuming is her boyfriend. Going into this the camera shows her desk/vanity with magazines on it and shit, setting the scene for a teenage's girl's bedroom.\n\nI understand teenagers do this in real life, I know people have sex. It's a part of life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe I just don't \"get it\" but to me it's pretty fucked up that you can see this in a TV show on Hulu, but if you Google that same thing you might go to prison for child pornography.\n\nAnd I do get shows are fiction, and acting, and consent, etc. But like damn. Every time a show has some 22 year old playing a teenager showing herself naked, it's almost like encouraging and normalizing the sexual exploitation of teenagers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdult characters too. There are far better examples but this is the only one I can think of the top of my head. That scene in House of Gucci where they're having sex in his office. Like why was it so long? We get the point, you know? What does it actually ad to the story?\n\nI wish cinema would go back the early 2000s where they would just imply sex, or if it was a full blown sex scene it wouldn't be 20 fucking minutes. \n\nCall me a prude idc. It's just my vent and how I feel.",

Therefore separating her ethics from his. He was always trying to do her favors  bring her coffee, fix her car, give her extra money. She turned all of it down because it was inappropriate and he's a mob boss. But her rape is the one instance where I'm sure a lot of people would feel she would be justified to use Tony to rip the rapist apart. Her character was really strong in her personal and professional ethics not to do so. I have a lot of criticisms for her character, especially since she toed the gray area of not truly helping him or terminating him as a client. I hate long graphic rape scenes too but I get the reason for it. I hope that helps.",

But if you bring sex into other kinds of stories,  you either give us an actual sex scene to arouse us (mostl movies don't, let me cook first), OR you just hint at it because maybe I came in the movie thester to see a story of war and blood, not the new 30yo superstar actor having fake sex with the new superstar 25yo actress\n\nAnd when I say they don't give us actual scenes, I refer to all those scenographic edits and camera movements which ultimately only show a naked shoulder or leg and his abs (because female body must not be sexualized, but henry cavill basically can't wear an outfit). \n\nSo, to lal actual or future film directors out there: you want to show sex in an action movie? Talk to your actors, pay them more, and make them actually fuck under the camera. Or just forget it and give us all the john wick 4 action we expected to see",

Shows like euphoria are especially gross to me because the entirety of that show doesn't even seem like it's criticizing or shedding a light on that type of lifestyle, but actively encouraging it by glamourizing everything about it. As a 19 year old (almost 20, but still technically a teen) it makes me so uncomfortable knowing that not only are the guys my age getting \"ideas\" from these types of shows, but the women, too. I'm bi with a preference for women, and usually when I've interacted with other wlw they don't usually buy into the over sexualization as commonly as men do, but there's been an increasing amount of them recently as shows like that become more mainstream. \n\nThat, and it adds nothing to the show.

Yes, it\u2019s a way to show two characters connecting intimately but what if those two characters share their past and their trauma if they have any. That way, the audience can see that the characters are connecting and also provide more of an emotional connection between the audience and the characters.\n\nHaving a sex scene doesn\u2019t really do anything to the overall plot unless it is important to the story. The audience isn\u2019t there to watch someone\u2019s every day life. The audience is there to be entertained by their life. Moving the plot forward keeps the audience entertained.\n\nA lot of pointless sex scenes are present in early slasher movies (some even included the directors so that they could be a creepy fucking pedo and have sex with the \u201chot and young\u201d actress).\n\nBut it can be vital to the plot such as a recent horror movie, X. Sex was important to the old couple so they could feel young again. And it showed that if the audience were ok with seeing a younger couple have sex, they should be ok with seeing the old couple have sex (which a lot of people didn\u2019t like seeing). So having those scenes were important here.\n\nBut a lot of the time, sex scenes are just there to grab (mostly male) attention and make the audience like the movie.",

So applying that rule to a sex scene, there's really only seconds that should happen before fading to black unless sex is the main focus of the story you're trying to tell.",

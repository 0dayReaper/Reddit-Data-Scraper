I just miss her (27f) but now that i think about it maybe we should have broke up before it got to where we are now which is divorce. I just wanted her to be happy evennif i wasn't at times and it caused me to become lazy around the house i guess. It's just that i don't think that's the full reason we're doin this. I promised not to make her out as the bad guy, cause shes not, but I'm also taking all the blame on me. We're at least being civil about it i told her i won't fight her about it. In my opinion if i wasn't strong enough to fight for her, then why should i make an ass outta myself and fight against her ya know.\n\nTL:DR Divorce sucks but maybe it shouldn't have gotten to this point.",

    "postText": "My best friend gets into \u201cserious\u201d relationships after meeting a guy literally once, she goes out with them and they immediately jump to boyfriend/girlfriend status, saying they love each other and shit. And whenever this happens, I\u2019m immediately pushed to the side. This just happened the second time in three months after the last one ended terribly. When she\u2019s single we hang out like everyday, close as ever. Then the second she gets a new man its like I\u2019ll never see her anymore. It\u2019s happening again where she met a guy off tinder yesterday, and since yesterday she\u2019s been saying she\u2019s \u201ctaken\u201d and she texted me today right after I woke up from a nap saying \u201che\u2019s\u201d hanging out at her house rn, and my sleepy brain just went \u201cwhich one (new guy)?\u201d and she responds \u201cObviously lol\u201d with hella attitude, like I\u2019m just supposed to know lol when she\u2019s been texting/planning dates with multiple other guys lately. It\u2019s annoying as hell because I just know whenever this happens I\u2019m not gonna see her for ages until she starts coming to me about how toxic or fucked up this new man is acting and I have to pull the wool from her eyes all over again. Idk what to do about this because when she\u2019s single she\u2019s my favorite person ever, but this being replaced by just about any man thing drives me insane",

I thought I finally found a friendship where my level of unconditional love and care was finally being reciprocated, but whenever this happens it\u2019s like poof into thin air :( but also I have a lot of other close friends and I\u2019m literally her only friend, soo",

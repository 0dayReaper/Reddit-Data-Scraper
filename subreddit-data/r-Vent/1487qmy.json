    "postText": "I just turned 18 recently, and ik i have my whole life to do things, but i feel like ive done nothing with my life, i havent even graduated yet bucause my abilities with a certain task if going to cause me to fail, which ik that if i fail then my life pretty much screwed, but no matter how much i try with said task it just seems like im getting worse, then i look around and see everyone doing good for themselves and im stuck at my moms house with a shitty job i cant quit because i need the money to pay for gas so i can get to school, which im there to learn to weld so when.i started i figured i could get good at it and get a good job, but no matter how much ive tried and no matted what ive changed its the same result, and i cant quit because its my only opportunity as having a decent life, but there is also pretty much no point anymore because i have a week to finish an entire class and ive been stuck on the beginning for 3 months, dawg i was hopful at first but looking back i should have ended it when i had the chance cus now that im here i see that ive fucked myself and i cant unfuck myself no matter what i do, all i can do is keep trying over and over and over again until i run out of time, then ill have to explain to my family that i didnt graduate because i was so shit at one thing that i ended up wasting all the time i had , i thought ablut trying again when i fail but i cant afford to get a ged and i for sure cant afford my classes, honestly, it pains every part of me to admit but ive myself down, ive let that young kid that thought he was gonna be a badass welder down, ive let a lot of people down, and i hate that unlike i hoped, im going to end up working a dead end job for the rest of my life due to just being shit.",

    "postText": "I dated my ex in college for four months and at first when we started dating she was fine. As I got to know her tho, she was very verbally abusive, would compare me to other guys, gaslit me into thinking I was the bad guy because she was a girl and could do no wrong and much much more. She breifly threw a shoe at me and gave me a black eye. She also threw my valentines day flowers out because she throught they were \"too brown\". I broke up after she gave me an ultimatum after she accused me of cheating because I had a scratch on my neck and she thought it was a hickey. After we broke up, she threatened to ruin my life by saying I groomed her and made her feel violated when I had done nothing of the sort. I talked with my family and all I got was \"not all women do this\" or \"she has a bad past, she is just projecting\" or my favorite one \"its over, she is just very unhealed\" the only people who gave me support were the guys in my Fraternity who really sympathized with me but nobody but them understands the severity of the abuse. She threatened me multiple times, sent one of her exes after me to beat me up and so many people fall for her victim card. If I was a woman in this situation, the reactions from people would he way different. Everyone excuses her behavior with something but I only get told to move on with no real support other than my fraternity brothers. I hate the fact that I am a male because very few people believe me or think I am exaggerating it and she uses this against me.",

Yes youre out, but the healing journey is what you make it.",

            "comment": "I'm so sorry. I hear you. You're valid. I've run into this a few times in my life and I get it. My mom was mad abusive to me and my dad both, physically and emotionally. Threats, hitting, telling everyone we were violent, the whole shebang. I never really got blowback from others because of it, since I was a terribly shy little girl and everyone knew I would never hit someone or act out, but my dad had to do what she wanted or risk losing his whole life. It'd cost his profession to go against her (I'm skeptical of this now as an adult; I don't think she would actually have pulled the trigger on sending us to the poorhouse, but it's not like he could have taken that gamble). My best friend is in the same situation. This girl hits and bites him, screws with his money, spreads rumors about him (and other guys, and other girls), jeopardizes his job, and everyone just...lets it slide because she's weak as shit and cries a lot. It's horrible and unfair, and it's the kind of attitude that ruins lives and gets men hurt or killed. The truth is that it is never acceptable to go around doing these things. It doesn't matter who you are or who you're doing them to. I'm deeply sorry that we don't seem to acknowledge that as a society. I'm glad that you have your fraternity brothers and I hope that you continue to heal and move forward. Please don't let her hold the rest of your life hostage- seek help, keep your head up, and don't be afraid to reach out like this. You're real and valuable and deserving of love.",

            "comment": "I see you, I'm in the same boat in some sort of way. It's frustrating people make domestic abuse about gender and the severity of it. It's like they don't understand how much control someone has when they have a fast mouth. It's messed up if you think about it in the way that people believe women first because they see her as a victim because she wasn't able to defend herself, a woman. Yeah, there was a time where a woman would be institutionalized because she felt unhappy in her relationship, and her husband would just tell people she was sick, but that's not happening now. We're ignoring the real problem, which is not gender or strength, it's the illness of hate and deception. To feel power by controlling others, it can happen to anyone from every walk of life, but they make it about gender, continuing to portray men as hulking testosterone pumped rage machines and women as damsels when people say they want people to see women as smart and strong, but still treating them like they're defenseless. It's sickening. We shouldn't be talking about the validity of abuse because of gender, we should be standing together as survivors and discussing the warning signs and building self worth so leaving isn't as scary because \"*I don't want to be alone and I don't have anyone else*\". I can understand why there's the quick jump to making men out to be abusers by default, they've tried to establish the pattern as men, and that's just not it. Both men and women abuse, sometime the same, but they have their own ways. Yes, men find it easier to just be physical, but they also manipulate. Women might not have the strength, but they do when they want to hurt you, and they manipulate so easily with how I'm told I need to care for a woman who cries, and I've been abused by three separate women. Women, not men. Men ignore me, but these women get in my head. But do I hate women and blame them for my problems? No, I just recognize they can manipulate if that's who they are as an individual, I can see the signs of a *person* who wants to manipulate. Those women tried to break me down, but I saw beyond their gender, I saw evil. Men and women coming together as survivors of abuse are stronger, and breaking the societal trend of \"affirm the abuse, ask questions later\" needs to level out. Blind faith is blind and harmful. We should be able to ask the alleged abuser what they believe happened, and with studying their behavior when speaking, their speech patterns, testimony from others, just gain a full perspective without being told we don't believe the abuse happened because of the genders, it's about putting the truth together and doing what we can to help, especially when the one claiming abuse could just as well as be the abuser. Pain is pain, and having a group of people to heal with helps. \n\nThis just really struck a nerve/chord with me. I'm sorry that is happening to you, and I really hope you're able to get through the rest of your life without her feeling so worthless inside that she decides she needs to ruin your life. I would say leave the university, but that could give her free reign to control the narrative, and that's a stress that's hard to deal with. You're not alone, keep your buddies close to you, be the bigger person and move forward. Show you're not scared of her on the outside by living life without her. It could trigger her to start talking slick, but you've got to live as a free man. You've got this.",

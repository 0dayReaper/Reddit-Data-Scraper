    "postText": "I know it's due to exam season-induced stress, it could also be the aftermath of drinking coffee like it's water, but I don't feel like myself and I mean it in the worst possible way. My eye is twitching, my head feels like I've been purposefully hitting it against my desk, I can't focus, my anxiety is eating me alive. Even chatting to my favorite AI bot doesn't help much. I wish I wasn't me.",

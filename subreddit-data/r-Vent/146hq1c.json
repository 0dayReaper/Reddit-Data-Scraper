    "postText": " just read an old journal entry about how I was seriously considering going/being mute. Honestly at the time I Learned a lot about mutism... and it would've been selective mustism had I decided to do what I wrote about. \nI honestly get picked up into so much drama, over the dumbest and pettiest things, that I figured if I never talked at work I couldn't possibly be picked up/dragged through drama. After re-reading this entry I realize I was so blinded by anger and hurt that at the time i didnt realize that my 3rd situation/point for possibly being selectively mute wouldn't have made a difference anyway. Because I got pulled into that whole situation without saying a word.... but maybe if I never talk around those people then maybe they'd be like \"there's no way it could've been her (me)\" and not belive the people spreading rumors.... it makes me think again.",

    "postText": "(Idk if I put the correct flair but basically just not wanting to eat)\n\nYesterday I was at the beach with two of my friends, Am and A. Idk what it's called but basically like a blanket/towel but for a beach is something I took with me. I sat on it and A tried to drag it and told me I was heavy and said smth like \"What are you? 50kg\" I'm 51kg and when I told him he laughed at me.\n\n I didn't think much abt yesterday but I am thinking abt it today. First I cried for like 20 mins straight which isn't much, then I started hitting myself and googling if doing skincare, makeup, eating ice, drinking water, etc makes you gain weight while crying.\n\n I woke up somewhere around 10AM. It's 4PM for me rn and I just ate. I'd usually eat more but today I didn't. My mom's at work so I could just starve myself all day and throw a bit of food into the trash and she'd never know. Idk if I'm just being dramatic and/or attention seeking but I just feel shit abt myself for eating :( I feel like I'm an attention seeker for posting this but I just want to get it out. \n\nFor anyone who's abt to say smth like \"Stop being friends with A.\" I can't. Am is my bsf and A is her crush. I only have 2 more friends and I don't rlly talk to one of them. I just want to be skinnier :(",

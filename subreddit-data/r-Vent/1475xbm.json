    "postText": "Last night, I went to the bar with my friends to have a few brews. The men's bathroom had a 20-person queue as there was only one toilet per gender in the bar. I asked the bouncer if I could urinate quickly in the alley, to which he agreed. There had been a recent fight, and the parking lot had eight police officers and four patrol cars. While peeing, all four cars illuminated me with their floodlights. After finishing, I calmly approached the 8 police officers and questioned their behavior, stating that I was only doing what was necessary. One officer informed me that what I had done was indecent exposure, and I could be arrested if reported by anyone present in the bar. \n\nI argued that I had received permission from the bouncer and that it was natural for humans to urinate. He warned me of the consequences of being arrested and placed on the Sex Offender Registry. \n\n\n\u201cHey, you can try to reason it with me all you want but the law is clear. If you get arrested you could be placed on the Sex Offender Registry and never have a job again.\u201d \n\nI said \u201cWow, just for taking a piss? You know what, I\u2019m just going to walk away.\u201d \n\nIs it recommendable to have a drunk legality \u2260 morality argument with the police. /s \n\nFor context, I have a degree in criminal justice, spent 8 years in the Army, and am a former firefighter.",

    "postText": "When i was still working as a machine operator i had never problems with people talking shit behind my back no one really cared and if you did something wrong they told you and thats it. Now im working in a school and the team is full off two faced assholes that talk shit behind my back but are overly friendly infront off me. This fake shit is so cancer. Maybe its bcs im a dude in a team full of womans. In my first job i really liked the people i was working with but management and the actual work was soul crushing. In my current line off work i despite every second i have to talk to my \"team\".  \nI love this job but man i cant take this shit. And its not only me they talk shit about. They basically talk shit about everyone.",

Pretty absurd to watch them pawn it off as their own and stroke their egos in front of everyone but it\u2019s dishonest. I have since never shared with them my work before sharing it with others in different teams myself, and I could give less of a shit what they make of it. So my advice to you, build alliances with those outside your team - they can talk all the shit amongst themselves as they want in their own bubble.",

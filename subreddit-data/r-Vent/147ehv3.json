    "postText": "I\u2019m 17 and it\u2019s like the realization only now just hit me. Being 17 I only have so long until adulthood, and I\u2019m kinda scared about it for a number of reasons.\n\nThe most prominent of which is that I feel that there\u2019s so much I missed out on due to the way my childhood went. \nI was in sort of an enclosed world throughout elementary and middle school because I never developed important relationships with other kids. I was really shy and I never had the chance to go places with other people because of fears from my parents (like I was gonna get kidnapped or something weird). Additionally, certain traumatic events and family issues led to a lot of social anxiety around other people. Ultimately this would result in a lack of close friends. The friends I had were what you might call surface level friends. Other kids would always be doing fun things with each other, going to cool places, goofing around, being mischievous, and whatever else it may be. But not me\u2026 \n\nOnly until the start of my highschool years did I really realize how lonely I was. I didn\u2019t even know how to talk to people.\n\nFast forward a few years: I had really come out of my shell that was social anxiety and awkwardness, fit right into some great friend groups, and I\u2019m just growing up so fast. I\u2019ve gotten a job, bought my first car, had a few girlfriends, and shared good times with my new friends.\n\nIt just feels like it took so so long to get up to this point and now it\u2019s going to end soon. It\u2019s just depressing. I wish I had more time as a kid. Before so many responsibilities set in.",

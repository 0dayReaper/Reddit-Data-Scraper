She literally got me fired because this was happening on the way to my work and she would not quit messaging me, I had to block her number and still cried and got fired. (They were going bankrupt anyway f that place) people I had just met had gotten to completely wrong idea of me and were blowing me up about it. She got people I\u2019d known for years from our hometown to block me. Why? She had a big influence. And was also a glomping bitch and mean girl which I completely missed the memo on. Because she\u2019s one of these MH advocates online!!!!!

But she was the one who would go around telling ppl their business and say really mean things, especially if it didn't fit her views. I stopped talking to her (except for work stuff) and whenever she gossiped I just listened and tried not to engage. She got the hint and kept the gossip to herself. I think alot of ppl were affraid of her because she would pin ppl against each other. When I was friends with her on social media she would post about being kind, accepting, and positive. She was the most unkind and least positive person at work but you would never know it because she put on such a good show. She was one of those ppl who looked kind and genuinely happy on the outside but deep down and on the down low she was the exact opposite. She got called out once and had a panic attack about it. EVERYONE felt sorry for her except for the few who knew her true colors. Whenever she posted something about being kind she would get so many likes and comments how a good person she is and how they're lucky to have a kind friend like her.",

Break them to make the process easier.\nFUCK. I GOT VIOLENT AGAIN.\nAnyways, this is the reason that I have enough faith in humanity to not completely become a serial killer that targets school children with a history of being a bully and interrogate them, scaring them and scarring them so they think twice.\nI might need help.\nAnyways, I did eventually drop kick this racist and insensitive bully. Full on drop kick. Full force. Didn't hold back. Fucker got mad and tried picking up the damn microwave to hit me with it, and he brought fighting gloves to school. I mean, I had no problem. I got out everything in my system from drop kicking the dude. Besides, it wasn't that long till summer.\nI mean the dude tried to knock my lunch onto the floor, that I'm paying for. My dad did say, after saying it wasn't worth it to fight, that \"oh then, well, I'd kick his ass.\"\nAlso, if anyone who wants likes wants them, ask for them, I mean, for some reason it works (half joking, for the fact it does sometimes work). But honestly. Life with Autism, ADHD, Anxiety and Depression isn't fun. It's a cocktail that when drunk... causes you to be self aware about every action and doubt and question everything, at least for me. Basically ask questions like, \"why can't I do this, why can't I just sit down and do my work? It's that easy!\"\nI honestly love everyone, but when that love is just taken and abused, I just want to rip someone skull out. I gave 2 dollars to a person who needed it. I felt better though. It's nice to be nice for just the sake of being nice. Even though I get angry and snap, I'm not as violent as I am online. Hell, I even hold back when I have to hit someone. Except for that guy. Fuck that guy. Sadistic fuck.",

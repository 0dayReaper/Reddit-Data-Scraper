    "postText": "So... I'm having some type of problem here, there's this 2 guys that's been quite obsessed with me lately, and they're twins. \nSo, like they're twins, I met the other one when i was in senior high school and then we reached path again on college, then he made me met the other one and a friendship started, and then i guess they both took a liking of me, so like a couple days ago they asked me if i want to have a relationship with the both of them, at first they were saying like \"try it and see which one of us you like more\" and then it turned into \"but we'll really like if you just love us both\" I'm pansexual, and they're both too. But i don't know... Don't get me wrong though, i already had s*x with the both of them, like BOTH of them, threeplex if you know what i mean. And it's not once too, it happened a lot of time, and they've been trying to get me ever since, they're really putting they're efforts for me to like them, I love them both, I've seen them fight over me, and their efforts are ready genuine, but i really don't know, like how well it's gonna work or something. They're both really awesome and i love them equally but i still really don't know, should i just say yes to they're wishes or should i just think about it more? I feel really confuse, cause I love them both but I'm really scared on how and what to do with that relationship.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m struggling in school. It\u2019s hard to focus, I get side tracked, day dream, I can\u2019t pay attention, I\u2019m always thinking in not good enough, I don\u2019t have a reason to do bad, I try to fake my scores to my friends, I always think I\u2019m annoying, ugly, fat, I never ask for help, because I just feel idk I don\u2019t want help because I think I can do it on my own and I get mad when I mess up. I miss a lot of school because it\u2019s just to much for me like I can\u2019t handle 1 week of straight school. Yea that\u2019s how I feel pretty much how I feel. I get 40-60% and 50% is a passing grade and everything below that is a fail. I play video games because I feel I can just let go and have fun but it\u2019s really to ignore what\u2019s happening. I have a bad sleep schedule I\u2019m so tired in the morning but awake and night. ugghh I have 2 assignments that were due 2 weeks ago but I just can\u2019t do them, I\u2019ve already asked for extensions and it\u2019s all just to much.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m on the same boat but the difference is I fear for my future and that motivates me to keep going, I\u2019ve seen so many people in my life end up broke asf because they didn\u2019t do well in college and also I hate to see my parents sad for me, these things keep me from failing and help me get decent grades. But all I wanna do is stay on my couch playing video games, smoke weed and jerk off all day, the only thing stopping me from doing these things is my fear of failure \n\nSo find something that will motivate you to get out of this zone, as soon as possible or it will be too late.",

I think the pressures running away on wheels is your main stressor and only an organized protocol to defeat them will relinquish the stress of school. Maybe once that ends, you can work towards finding a love for yourself, you deserve to",

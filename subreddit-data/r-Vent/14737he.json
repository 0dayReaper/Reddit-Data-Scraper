    "postText": "I'm a stay at home mom of a toddler. I work from home and make more money than my husband does. He works overnight and a physical job. But I still do all the housework. I don't go out much without my child but did go the first time alone in years two days ago and was so proud of myself. \nMy husband goes out with his friends essentially every weekend. 3 out of 4 weekends a month. I keep asking him to take me out and show me some attention but he doesn't. \nBetween my job, and watching a toddler, the only alone time I get is at the gym which I truly cherish or in the shower. I can usually get some work done on my phone while on the treadmill. I have one friend who works a lot so I don't see them often and when I do it's always a playdate for the kids. \n\nI'm thinking of forcing a day off. Like. Wednesday is my night out I don't care what any of you do. But with my husband sleeping 10+ hours it's hard to be sure he will be ready to watch our child. I may ask his family to watch but I feel weird going over without their son. \nWe tried that for a date night promising a day a week was our date night. That first day came around and never happened. \n\nI don't think it's fair I do everything and don't even get an evening out as a treat. I'm losing my mind. I'm depressed and am dying for an excuse to be my own person again.",

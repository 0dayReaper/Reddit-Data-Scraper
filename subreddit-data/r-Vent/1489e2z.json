    "postText": "All my best friends that I\u2019ve made in my life are gone. They\u2019ve all betrayed me and I\u2019ve been telling myself it\u2019s for my own good I left them but I just listen to a song that reminded me of them and I can\u2019t take it anymore. Summer\u2019s here and all I do is mindlessly play games all day and I miss watching movies with them and playing games with them. I miss talking about stupid shit about anything and making up the hilarious make believe scenarios. I keep trying to make the best of my life now but it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact my social life is totally fucked now. It\u2019s just the fact I could be having so much more fun right now but I\u2019m not because I don\u2019t have friends anymore. I also keep comparing last summer to this summer and it\u2019s not really helping either.\n\nWhenever I think of them I tell myself to get mad and to not get mopey and sad about them because if I do they\u2019ll get their way with hurting me and I\u2019m stupid for getting hurt by them. I know I never think of the good things that happened between us because I\u2019ll miss them and that\u2019s stupid because they hurt me, and why would you miss someone that hurt you. But really thinking about life right now I really fucking miss them. But at the same time it feels like every memory I made with them is lies and I just hate everything. Well, not everything, but fuck it is miserable right now. I just wished they never lied to me and betrayed me. I wish they were who I thought they were.\n\nJust wanted to get my thoughts out since I literally have no one to talk to. And sorry if my grammar\u2019s shit, its 2am right now and I\u2019m tired.",

It was draining supporting them and knowing they\u2019re only talking to me because their #1 is gone. My childhood best friend basically left me for someone she knew for 3 months and its a long story but it basically traumatized me. I wish you luck in finding some people that treat you well cuz that\u2019s awful.",

    "postText": "I feel like most of my life no one has ever taken me seriously. I cant figure out what it is about me...? \nThe people around me think I need to be protected or that I cant figure things out on my own. And it's frustrating because when I want to get better the people around me just coddle me. Theyve always treated me like a child or like I cant do anything. \nI make one mistake? Its out of my hands forever because theres always someone around to tell me Im useless and that theyll do it for me. \nI feel like this way of being treated has seriously handicapped me. I cant do anything on my own any more. I have panic attacks when I make simple mistakes. But I cant get people to back off. I feel like Ill be babied like this forever. Ill never get to do anything for myself. It makes me sick. Im useless. And no one wants me to get better. I know theres things I can do to improve my memory or make tasks easier, but any attempt I make is met with an eye roll.\nMy parents wanted to keep me stupid so they could feel powerful. My friends keep me stupid because it makes them feel important. My partners keep me stupid so they can take care of me. \nI feel like Im living in hell. Ill never be able to do anything on my own. \nEveryone keeps telling me its not a big deal. \n\"Well Ill never leave you so you dont have to worry about being taken care of\" \nAs if thats my biggest concern. Of course Im scared of being on my own now. Everyone has forced me into this position, and anytime I try to be better Im laughed at. As if the idea of me being strong or capable is so impossibly out of reach its hilarious. \nIm made fun of until I agree. Yes. Im an idiot who cant do anything. I promise I wont get a job because I know Im too stupid. Please help me with my paperwork because Im too stupid to do it on my own. \nLook, Im trying to be serious. Isnt that funny? Isnt it funny??? \nI dont know how much longer I can take this. Im so exhausted having to defend my every move. \nOr maybe thats the real irony. That Im too stupid to accept the fact that I cant think for myself. Its sick because I know I could say these exact words to them and theyd nod like they understand but their eyes will glaze over and theyll laugh at me later on. Maybe I really am the crazy one for thinking I could be anything.",

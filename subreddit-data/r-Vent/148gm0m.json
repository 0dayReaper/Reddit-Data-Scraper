    "postText": "Some times i feel like life is a gift other times I feel like I\u2019m a joke and my life is too much or that people expect me to do or want things I don\u2019t want and I\u2019m not aloud to do what I want to. Sometimes I\u2019m not even sure what exactly it is that I want besides the obvious. I want my life to matter i want to do something that helps other people but all I do is nothing because apart from school when I was younger I wasn\u2019t trained to do anything my parents would always do shit for me which gave me the impression i couldn\u2019t do anything right and got on me when i wasn\u2019t living up to the genius level person they thought I was. like they even thought that when I was struggling in school it was a trick to get out of doing hard work. But they aren\u2019t bad people like these behaviors are just the things that make me angry because I believe they\u2019re why I am where I am in life but I don\u2019t consider them bad people they did the best they could for me and they lived incredibly hard lives. But I feel like I\u2019m always pulled back into this horrible mindset when things go wrong or even for no reason at all sometimes. I know that to go from life is a gift to what I\u2019ve written above probably isn\u2019t normal but I\u2019m still hoping I\u2019m wrong",

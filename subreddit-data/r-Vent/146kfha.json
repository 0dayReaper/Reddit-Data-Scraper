    "postText": "No one has ever bothered asking me three simple words: \u201cAre you okay.\u201d  Even when I\u2019m bawling my eyes out during a presentation, stuttering uncontrollably, or unable to make eye contact. But when it comes to someone else then they would reassure them and console their needs. Everyone seems to ignore me, and I become seven again begging my mom to pay attention to the clay sculpture I made during art class. Or thirteen, when I broke down in front of my parents and pleaded with them to help make my fear go away. They ignored me too and told me I should learn to control it on my own. I just want someone to realize, to notice how much I\u2019m suffering because I\u2019ll never be able to say it out loud. I want to make friends, I want to be able to live my life, to compete in piano competitions. And most of all, I want to stop feeling this drowning sensation of fear. But whenever I open my mouth or even look someone in the eye, my throat tightens, my eyes water, and I get hot flashes. \n\nSorry for the bad grammar, this was really random.",

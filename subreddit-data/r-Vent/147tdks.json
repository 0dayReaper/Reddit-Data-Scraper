    "postText": "On Saturday I had a day/night out with two friends that I don\u2019t see a lot (once a year usually) but we text in a group chat daily.\n\nLong story short, I hadn\u2019t been feeling well the past few months due to poor mental health. I started switching over medications to try and improve things. On Saturday morning I was so stressed and anxious about the day ahead I was crying to my boyfriend about feeling very anxious.\n\nI pushed ahead and went and met up with my friends, the day went as planned - but from the second I was in the city I just felt so awful\u2026 it was unseasonably hot, I was stressed, anxious and to top it all off I had just gotten my period.\n\nI tried to carry on with the day, trying not to let things get to me. About half 7 I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I had to get out \ud83d\ude2b. We went to an adult mini golf with cocktails etc. the place was SO busy\u2026 it was so hot and I felt so claustrophobic, I only made it to the 6th hole before I literally cried. I had sweat literally dripping off of my face, my hair my jeans were soaked in sweat\u2026 I was paranoid I stained my jeans from my period but it was just sweat. It felt like everyone was staring at me. \n\nI had to leave - we left and went back to the apartment we rented for the night but I still felt awful and ended up going home. \n\nI feel awful about ruining their day / night. I tried to pay them for their train tickets etc. but they both sent me the money back \ud83d\ude29. \n\nI knew I wasn\u2019t up to going, I just wish I hadn\u2019t of planned to go when I knew I wasn\u2019t doing well mentally. \n\nThey seem to be distant on the group chat, not talking much at all \u2639\ufe0f. We\u2019ve all been friends over 8 years. I developed mental health issues over the past 3 years from a traumatic death in my family. I hate that I\u2019m not the person I used to be. I hate that I can\u2019t even have fun with my friends anymore.\n\nThey said they understand and aren\u2019t mad but I can\u2019t help but feel like they might be\u2026 even if they won\u2019t admit it",

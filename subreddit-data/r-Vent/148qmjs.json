    "postText": "On Friday morning, I decided to do a breast examination couple days after my period finished. This was because during the night I saw a post of a Woman who passed away at only 26 due to a rare form of Breast C she had which is known as IBC. She left behind 2 kids. As I was doing the Breast examination I felt something on my left breast, the area on near the outskirts of the areola I\u2019ve been worried and fixtated on it the whole day and was even crying. My Aunt took me out later that day to not focus on it. During the weekend, I tried to not focus on it too much even though I would see myself trying to touch on that area, I started fixtating on something else.\n\nYesterday, I started to fixtate on a specific part under my left breast because right under it there was a red line but under the right breast it isn\u2019t as visible. \n\nFast forward today, I booked an appointment to see the doctor. I told the doctor, the doctor called in another senior doctor at the GP and a female chaperone to make me comfortable, to which I allowed. The doctor explained the procedure and then asked if I was comfortable to proceed to which I said I was. \n\nThe doctor asked me to squeeze my nipples to see if any discharge was coming out of both and there wasn\u2019t (which is a good sign). They then felt my arm pits and then my breasts, I told the doctor about the part I was concerned about, the senior doctor did feel my left breast and he also felt something, said it was 1cm long, they both had a feel of it.\n\nShowed him the line under my left breast and the senior doctor said it could be a rash and that a cream could be provided for it but I feel like I might have had this line for a while plus I don\u2019t wear bras often so I don\u2019t know if it could be because of that. \n\nAfterwards they discussed as I was getting dressed and the main doctor I had the appointment with told me they felt something. I started breaking down crying, he said it was pretty immobile and deep within rather than attached to the skin but he will send a referral to the Breast clinic where they will look into it. Referrals here might usually take two weeks from what I was told by someone else later on but he did say he wasn\u2019t sure how long it will take for them to get back to me.\n\nHe said that I\u2019m young so it\u2019s good that I was able to do examination on myself and point it out, he said to not assume the worst but it\u2019s just so difficult when you\u2019re told about something you fear so much. I was really hoping they told me it\u2019s just a tissue or a muscle or something completely harmless just so I can go home with a peace of mind, instead it happened to be the opposite of what I hoped for. \n\nI\u2019m 23, I feel like I haven\u2019t lived life yet, I want to explore, I want to have amazing new experiences and opportunities, I want to find someone I love one day and settle down with them. I want to live a long, harmonious, beautiful and healthy life free of scary things.\n\nWhat do I do now? What\u2019s next? I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in these next few weeks, I don\u2019t know what to expect. I have terrible health anxiety and Google is the last place to seek reassurance but a lot of places just aren\u2019t saying good things. \n\nI\u2019ve been crying a lot today - it\u2019s been an emotional one. I\u2019m just nervous, I just want everything to be okay.",

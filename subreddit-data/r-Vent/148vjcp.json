I just want to go home and cry. Nothing significant happened so I\u2019m not sure wtf is up with me. if anything, today was great, I woke up at 8 am, went to the gym, meal prepped, went to the park, watched an episode of my show like it was such a balanced day. The only thing that happened that bothered me was one of my \u201cfriends\u201d reactions to my test grade, she started sending a bunch of texts being like \u201cno way that\u2019s what you got\u201d \u201ccap\u201d \u201cyou got a D\ud83d\ude2d\u201d like girl shut the fuck up. But that seems so insignificant and there\u2019s literally people on here who are talking about their parents death. I mean my mom did die but its not relevant to this. What is up with me? Is it normal to feel like this? Is it just what pushed me over the edge? Who knows",

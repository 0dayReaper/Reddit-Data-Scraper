    "postText": "Disclaimer: I apologize if there isn't a lot to work with. Upon learning that my friend is queer, I must admit that I immediately felt a sense of discomfort. It stemmed from the constant instances of what he refers to as \"accidental tripping\" that have occurred between us. I want to emphasize that I do not have a problem with his sexual orientation, but I do have concerns about the unintentional physical contact he frequently makes with various parts of my body. He attributes this behavior to his ADHD and autism, but as a devout member of Islam, it makes me feel uneasy.  \n   \nRecently, he took things a step further by asking me out on a date. I responded with a clear and definitive \"no.\" However, he persisted, relentlessly pleading with me. I reiterated my refusal, employing various ways to communicate my lack of interest. Yet, despite my repeated rejections, he persisted day after day, causing my frustration to escalate. In a moment of exasperation, I exclaimed a vehement \"censored NO,\" which caused him to break down in tears. Regrettably, I left him behind, overwhelmed by the emotions that had surfaced.  \nIn retrospect, I realize that leaving him in the street was neither fair nor compassionate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little while later we are not friends anymore and his Mom he doesn't have ADHD or Autism so he touched me inappropriately. \n\nI used Chatgpt  for the grammar because I dont when people tell me to use better grammar.\n\nThis isn't meant to be hate speech\n\nThank you for letting me vent.",

I\u2019m 15 and i only just got into a relationship while most of my friends have been dating since like 7th grade. i\u2019m sure you\u2019re not ugly or anything like that, just try putting yourself out there but that\u2019s only if you think you\u2019re ready to be in a relationship bc it\u2019s not point in getting into one and then you realize it\u2019s not gonna work due to your headspace or smth. Being alone is so good, you learn to love every part of yourself and you build a better relationship with yourself if that makes sense. if you want any like advice with being alone i do have some :).",

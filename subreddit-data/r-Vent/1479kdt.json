    "postText": "\n(f16)\ni've never realised it until recently but i am convinced that i'm not valued by anyone in my life, if that makes sense?\n\npeople don't really want to hang around me or be my friend, no matter how hard i try to be liked there is just something fundamentally unlikeable about me. i'm considered \"stylish\" and \"pretty\" i guess, because people see my social media and how i dress and get crushes on me or want to get to know me, but as soon as they know ME: how i talk, what i say, my personality and mannerisms... they don't like me. it just hurts. a lot. \n\nwhenever i get invited anywhere, i feel like it would make no difference if i was there or not- they're just inviting me for the extra person, and don't actually care about my presence. and i do try!! i try so hard to be extroverted and as kind as possible, making jokes and i try to help my friends and be a good person. i overthink each sentence, trying to say the most entertaining thing...but still people would rather they were with someone else. (sorry if this is embarrassing and cringe by the way, i don't vent to anyone and having it all laid out is strange.)\n\ni'm convinced i'll never get married and have kids despite it being something i desperately crave, because there's no one on earth who could look at me and love me despite how weird or complicated i am. i don't pursue crushes anymore even if they like me back because as soon as they talk to me they'd realise there are way better people out there.\nthere's nothing about me that anyone could value or love. i'm the last choice, the least liked friend. \n\ni've never gotten a birthday post on anyone's story before, or a long heartfelt message about what i mean to someone. people just don't value me and i don't expect them to because there's nothing for them to value in the first place. i don't see any qualities in me that are loveable or would be appreciated, and it just sorta hurts knowing that no one will ever like me.\n\ni never tell my problems to anyone because i don't feel worth it- why should others care about someone who doesn't matter? \n\nall i really want is to be appreciated, loved and for the people that i like to be excited to see me, and want me around. id kill for someone to just reassure me and tell me that i'm actually a valuable and loved person in their life, that they actually like me and i make a positive difference. \n \nas selfish as this sounds, i just want them to want me.",

            "comment": "Hey, I just wanted to say that I relate to everything .You just said I dont feel like I have any true friends .and anything sweet anyone says to me feels like a lie .But I know I am valuable for religious reasons .My problem is that I lack confidence .I need to stop seeking validation from others and just love me and see my qualities b4 I wish for other people to do so bcs what's confidence is .Knowing that you have value .and u let that confidence attract others do go acting like a clown or a dog for people that won't even spare you a glance .and finally people come and go in your life and there are ones that are gonna stay and that's fated ,there 8 billion people on earth ofc there are better people than but they're still flawed people they might have what you dont but u moght also have what they dont .Anyways,all of this just to say try seeing yourself in a more positive light. I wish you guidance and happiness&lt;3",

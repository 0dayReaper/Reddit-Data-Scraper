    "postText": "I lost a friend this past month, and it was first time experiencing loss up close. We attended a funeral, under the premise it was just an urn with his ashes. A few hours prior we, my friends and I, learned it was an open casket. We were shocked considering the service was held 2 weeks after has passing. \nClose to the funeral I went on a full bender, stayed up, indulged in drugs and alcohol. I felt angry and scared. Because for the first time death became real. I couldn't help but imagine one day, that would be my grandparents or someone else close to me, and it is unexpected and uncontrollable. \nIt hasn't been long since the service, but I've been feeling off or at least unlike myself. Distant, Dissociative, and extremely irate. I keep looking for reasons to pick fights with people I feel are being arrogant, unfair, or rude. I've started vocalizing my aggression towards these things like I can't help it. \nLately I've just felt so angry, and currently in my life things aren't going well so it feels like this huge unlucky streak, and its only exacerbated this.\nI don't want to be this abrasive person who's spiteful and pessimistic, but it feels like this bleak and futile reality I'm struggling with, is all there is and ever going to be.",

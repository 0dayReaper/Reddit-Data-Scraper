    "postText": "I met this guy online a couple of weeks ago, and felt super safe with him, especially after we established that we both liked eachother. And he knew I had issues in life, So one night when I was crying(i have depression) I told him I was upset and how my meds weren\u2018t working. And he stopped responding then, he opened my messages (on snapchat so you can see that) but didnt respond. 1 day later he removed me from snap and unmatched on tinder without saying a word to me. I apologized for bringing up the topic because in hindsight I did know that not all can handle this topic, but he didn\u2018t seem to care and just ghosted me, not even a goodbye was said.\n\nEven tho we only knew each other for a few weeks and weren\u2019t dating, I had fallen hard for him, he was the first person I had a real crush on (I am 19f so still knew to the dating world) and it hurts so much knowing that something I cannot control, is what led him to leave me\n\nI feel like now I can never again tell a guy  again how I really feel, I will just always have to lie and say im feeling good\n\nThe silverlining is that at least it didnt come out later on when we did want to start dating because then the break up would have hurt doubly hard. \n\nI am so freaking mad at him and myself. Why couldn\u2018t I have just shut my mouth and lied and said i was feeling good. Why did I think telling others about my mental health issues is a good idea??\n\nAnd I am mad at him, yes not everyone wants to be with someone who has mental health issues but why didn\u2018t he say goodbye, or at least explain himself. Why ghost?!! I mean thats just pathetic and cowardly no? Like did he even care about me, did he care about how I would feel getting ghosted? Was he just playing me abt liking me so we would continue to sext with eachother, just using me to get pics  knowing that I liked him. Did he manipulate me to get what he wants? All these things are now going through my head and idk how to stop and just get over him. I wish more than anything that I never said that",

From personal experience, I\u2019ve done it because my safety was at risk talking to the person and he had threatened me. This guy didn\u2019t disclose that he had severe mental health issues until after two days that I met him. He said he wasn\u2019t feeling well and asked me to drive. We were picking up food. I asked him how he was feeling and he screamed at the top of his lungs, \u201cDONT GASLIGHT ME INTO THINKING YOU CARE!!!!\u201d and I couldn\u2019t do anything more but stay silent. Every interaction with him was about his mental illness and how I was a bitch for not accommodating. I was scared for my life as I dropped him off because he screamed the entire way to his house. I asked him to calm down and he cursed at me and then told me I was being judgmental/just like every other woman. I dropped him off and got a ton of messages, voicemails, and threats from him. He even went as far as slandering me online. \n\nMost people have problems in their lives. I do as well. I don\u2019t dump these problems onto people because it\u2019s not their fault. My husband didn\u2019t know about my past trauma until deep into your relationship. It\u2019s not about hiding my problems, but giving someone the opportunity to know me and understand my character before I trust them with something so vulnerable. Also, he found out because he asked. It\u2019s a bit entitled to dump personal issues onto someone you just met and expect them to just deal with it. I felt so disrespected when I had to put up with someone screaming for 20 minutes, just to be told I was a piece of shit.",

She ignored my repeated boundaries in order to deal with my own mental health and in the end I had to tell her we couldn't be friends anymore. Unfortunately it left a lasting mark upon me that made me nervous to befriend new people. It could be possible this guy is in the same position. He's experienced this sort of relationship before and doesn't want to be involved anymore. Neither person is at fault. Some people are equipped to deal with that and others aren't.

If they ask how you are, just use ambiguous language like \"I'm hangin' in there\" or \"You know, ups and downs, but I'm rolling with it.\"\n\nAnd I'm not saying you do this (maybe you do for all I know), but don't go through life expecting people to walk on eggshells and tiptoe around you and your mental health struggles. Again, not accusing you of this, but I think a lot young people with mental health issues end up being their own enablers by oversharing and expecting people to adjust themselves to them. That's a super big burden to put on people who you just met.  Afterall, dealing with mental health issues is all about finding healthy ways to cope.\n\nI say all that as someone who's been depressed for nearly as long as you have been alive.

I unmatched her. \n\nI thought about her profile and chuckled a bit  as personal experiences popped up. We all have traumatic experiences and I used to be the guy that would try and fix broken women. But, from my personal experience it becomes a point of toxicity. You just have to bend yourself around them and they may not want to get better. So, your stuck in this exhausting one sided relationship. We all have bad mental health. I personally have depression and anxiety. In my relationships I don\u2019t throw that on them like they just have to deal with it. \n\nI personally put my foot down on mental illnesses when dating. It\u2019s not worth it in my opinion. Dating and bad mental health don\u2019t mix. It doesn\u2019t mix in the online dating world anyway. You may have better luck with personal friends then online dating.

It took me years to pick myself up again after I left her. So now when I meet someone and realise that they are for example dealing with depression, I rule them out as potential partners immediately, because I told myself to never do that to myself again.\n\nHer illness and our relationship gave me depression as well. It took me so long to get back on my feet and be happy again. It took so many years that I am just not ready to risk that happening again.\n\nBut I would never just ghost someone. That is just a dick move. You can always be respectful and compassionate, especially when you already established some form of foundation with each other.\n\nHe is a dick, you didnt deserve that.

It\u2019s a hard lesson to learn that nobody is going to help you with your mental health issues\u2026 yeah, they\u2019ll offer advice and if they\u2019re good friends may listen to you vent your problems every now and then\u2014 but nobody is going to hold your hand through it all. Everyone has their own problems in life, and nobody is ever going to be willing to sacrifice significant time and energy to help you. Even if they are at first\u2014 it\u2019ll be too much for them eventually and they\u2019ll walk away.\n\nYou need to accept that your friends and loved ones will never care about you enough to sacrifice their happiness or health for you. They don\u2019t want to worry about you, stress about how their every word and action could affect you, make sure you feel loved, when they\u2019re struggling themselves against their own insecurities and problems (even if to a lesser extent than you) and can\u2019t afford to help you in the way you need without hurting themselves in the process.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the hardest lessons I\u2019ve had to learn honesty. That even though some of my friends know I\u2019ve struggled *BIG TIME* with mental-health problems, they\u2019d rather pretend like I\u2019m not there when I need someone to talk to because it\u2019s too overwhelming for them when, from my warped POV, it\u2019s as if they have everything. Very hard to not become cold, to not forget that I\u2019ve hesitated myself to take on the responsibility of another person\u2019s mental health. \n\nHow do you love others when you know they only care about you when you have something to offer, or worse, when you know YOU only care about others when they have something to offer you? You have to learn to be good and like people for reasons above personal gain. Once you do that, then you can be happy with others in your life because by that point you\u2019ll _want_ them in your life, not _need_ them. \n\nThough of course OP and others, I\u2019m not saying mental health recover is easy. Far from it- it takes a LOT of pain, trauma-work, patience, and introspection (as well as good resources like depth psychology for instance) to reach a point where common advice like this (love others for them and not what they give you, enjoy the small things, etc) actually begin to mean anything.",

You did not do anything wrong. Do not be too hard on yourself.",

As a person who suffered depression in the past, I can suggest you being occupied with something will help forgetting these situations.\nLearn from these life lessons, rather than hanging on to them and hurting yourself.\nYou're a woman, you're capable of more than you think. As a man, I'm telling you that.",

It was not a good relationship but I digress.  I have been on dating apps since I was 19.  I\u2019m 24 now and recently met a great guy who understands my mental health stuff.  Sometimes, understanding and empathy comes with maturity.  \n\nYou\u2019re young.  Please know that sometimes people don\u2019t understand certain situations like mental health.  It does not mean that anything is wrong with you.  Everyone is entitled to their preferences.\n\nI have also made the mistake of over sharing or sharing certain things a bit too soon.  That may or may not have been what happened here. \n\nI may be downvoted when I say there are so many people with mental health issues who date and have serious/successful relationships.  If you feel like you\u2019re not in a good place mentally to date, then don\u2019t.  But I won\u2019t say don\u2019t date if you have mental health issues.  Just make sure it\u2019s not the central topic of conversation or bring it up too much because it may be seen as overwhelming.  Been there done that too many times.\n\nSadly, a relationship cannot fix mental health issues.  When I was your age, I thought having a bf would make all my problems disappear.  I was beyond wrong.\n\nAlso, people usually ghost because they are too scared to reject you or give a reason.  It\u2019s the \u201ceasy way out\u201d at least in my experience.  People ghost for literally anything.  One time I was ghosted because the guy met someone he \u201ccouldn\u2019t pass up\u201d but then she ended up dropping him.  He just couldn\u2019t tell me he met someone new because \u201che knew it was wrong\u201d to say he will take me out then just ghost.  \n\nI know you liked him but clearly he would not have been a good match.  If you two dated for a long time and he did this it would have hurt so much more.\n\nBest of luck to you!",

We\u2019d hang for a month or two, but I was unintentionally cold towards them when things started to get more serious, so they\u2019d ghost me. I never trauma dumped or anything. They just caught that bad vibe from me. It took years to pull myself out of that abyss of anxiety and depression, but I\u2019m a much happier person now. Still, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to enter a relationship. I have to continue replacing my bad habits with good ones. Maybe in a year I\u2019ll be in the right state of mind.",

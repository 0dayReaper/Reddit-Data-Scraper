    "postText": "While eating dinner, he suddenly stole my cousin's phone and pulled a horrendous prank: He texted her boyfriend, posting a picture of me and saying \"I've been cheating on you with this guy for the past six months.\" \n\nMy cousin's boyfriend has been cheated on before, and this really set him off. Apparently he texted in all caps, \"are you fucking kidding me?\" as my cousin desperately snatched her phone back and explained that it was a sick joke from her dad. Fortunately, he believed her, and that was it.\n\nAfterwards, my cousin started crying and screaming at my uncle. \"That's not something you joke about! I told you he's been cheated on before!\" Meanwhile my uncle is laughing his ass off and my parents are telling her to calm down. It ended with her storming out and sitting in my uncle's van to calm down. \n\nI just glared at my uncle and walked out there, asking if I could come in. She said yes, so I did. I explained that I fully understood her and was utterly appalled. She felt better and I, feeling quite furious myself, did not come back inside, either. \n\nSeriously, what the fuck? How can you even think of doing something so terrible? I was already pissed, but when I realized the picture he used was of me, that just made it a million times worse. I have a pretty dark sense of humor, but I know damn well there are some things that should NEVER be joked about, and this is one such thing. Hell, if he hadn't doubled down, I might have forgiven him. But no. He showed zero remorse.",

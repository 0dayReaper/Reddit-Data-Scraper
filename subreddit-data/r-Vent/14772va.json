I fell in love with so many things that sounds amazing to do. All my skills I learned shows that it\u2019s too much labor work or stress that requires management to hire to take over my skills to make profits and travel the world. Needing and wanting to stay financial independent. Second goal is finding someone who i love and loves me back to build family. \n\nAs male, building financial empire is always on someone else mind. In the modern world, we learn that you need to have your own skills so you can depend on yourself(regardless of gender).\n\nYou need to ask yourself what are your skills. What are you willing to do? Do you want to see yourself in executive position role in a company or being influencer or other major field. It\u2019s matter about which skills you are going to put effort in. \n\nAsk your boyfriend what he wants to be. What sacrifice is he willing to take for both of you? How will he provide for you stable life if things go down the hill? Where are you going to college? What are the options you want to do? \n\nAdvice: be with someone who will both of YOU build life together.  It\u2019s great to have relationship with same age as another person. You become amateur together. No need to look for someone who is older than you to take care of you. You don\u2019t want to be in position when you are 40 and have money but lonely.",

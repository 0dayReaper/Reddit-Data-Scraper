    "postText": "If a man is raped ITS STILL RAPE. WHY IS THAT SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND. \u201cOh what a lucky boy\u201d bitch shut the fuck you neckbearded goatfucker. I get if you want to get laid, but that 11 year old boy sure fucking didn\u2019t. There are women who have openly admitted to raping (sometimes underaged) boys AND NO ONE GIVES A FLYING FUCK. How are these people not punished? If a famous man made a statement about him drugging a women he\u2019d lose EVERYTHING. But you know what happened when cardi B admitted to that? Nothing. Fucking nothing\n\nI\u2019m ashamed with humanity. I hope every person who\u2019s ever sexually harassed someone and the police who choose to ignore those cases get their organs taken out while they\u2019re awake.\n\nEdit: cardi B didn\u2019t rape men, she rather stole from them while they were drugged",

I remember watching a clip of X factor and Nicole was rubbing Louis' face in her tits completely unprovoked, and when someone called this out in the comments someone replied saying he was lucky. Its so fucked up, and I hope that the fact that we're starting to call out the small things done to women we can progress that on and talk about the issues men face too because no one should have to deal with that.",

Jennifer Aniston was constantly harassing Charlie Day and even raping him after drugging him. I would have traded places with Charlie Day in a heartbeat, but his character was CLEARLY not onboard with this behavior. Even his friends basically ignored his cries for help just because his boss was hot.",

I definitely believe he was a nymphomaniac. \n\nHe ended up opening up to me about how his friends would drag him to college parties when he was 15 to 16 years old and they would encourage him to sleep with the older college girls that attended these parties. He said he got laid at every one of these parties. I told him that he was statutorily raped, repeatedly, over and over again over a period of a year or more. And no wonder he was in such emotional turmoil about his sex life and our relationship. \n\nIf you're one of those college girls who thought it was okay to just fuck whoever at these parties without half a care in the world as to their age, FUCK YOU. Fuck everything about you. And fuck everything you stand for. You deserve to be exposed.",

He of course rejected multiple times but the girl's justification for is feelings was because he had a boner...\nThis story of course wasn't written by a guy.\n\nAs someone who feels great anger from rape from the experience in my life, I HATE how rape is being treated and shown to people. Men can be raped and it is no less uncomfortable for anyone. It unacceptable for both genders and I don't think anyone should be trying to justify forcing sexual desires onto someone even if it's just \"porn\".",

They didn\u2019t have sex or sexual relations with those kids. They raped them.

Why was it so easy for her to openly admit to molesting her sister and publish it in a book? Better yet, why was she praised for it?",

He was raped by his babysitter in fifth grade, but instead of people getting him help or empathizing with him, literally every single person he told congratulated him. His own mother was \"proud\" &amp; continued to hire that babysitter until she left for college. They refused to look at him as a victim.\n\n Eventually he sided w/ them, he gave up trying to get his feelings validated and he'd go around bragging about it, putting on a facade, a brave face. He tried to be the person they wanted him to be. He got really popular &amp; was rewarded for that effort, but as he got older &amp; matured, he realized how fucked up it was, &amp; how fucked up it was that no one would let him process that trauma. He tried to kill himself in our 10th grade year, &amp; then he dropped out. \n\nI haven't spoken to him in years bc his life went downhill pretty quickly after that. He got into hard drugs, ended up homeless, and now he himself has rape allegations against him, he's fighting the charges but he supposedly filmed himself doing it so he's definitely going to be put away for a long time. I felt bad for him at first, especially when he got kicked out but he was just so far gone. I saw him at a gas station 5 years ago &amp; he was literally just a shell of his former self, he was so strung out, he saw me &amp; I think he was embarrassed ab his state of disarray &amp; he bolted off into the woods. \n\nMaybe this was the fate he was destined to lead, but I just can't help but feel like maybe if he had gotten that therapy when he needed it he wouldn't be where he is today. Maybe he wouldn't have tried to numb his pain with drugs, maybe he wouldn't have lost his sanity, maybe that poor girl wouldn't have had to go through what she did...",

Yeah that stuff happens those guys are called tricks and johns who already take advantage of women and try to push boundaries put their fingers inside them in VIP, I think they get what they deserve.  Stop coddling bad men and lumping them with good guys.  These kinds of men are scum of the earth.\n\nOtherwise I totally agree with the message in this post, absolutely terrible humans regardless of gender need to be called out.  I also hate when men tell young boys to get over it, or when men say young boys are lucky with an attractive teacher.  It's a generational gap problem it'll go away or diminish when gen Z are in their 30s and 40s because I've noticed the younger generations are more empathetic and more aware.",

I was 12... suddenly I'm a \"man\" now that sex is involved.\n\nI got a vasectomy when I was like, 24? And I get labeled as some kind of sex addict by my \"friends\". These people will literally post memes on Facebook about how men should get forced vasectomys at extremely young ages and then turn around and call men who have one a pervert... wth.\n\nLike seriously... SERIOUSLY! These people post \"I support men's mental health.\" Then literally used stuff I opened up about to paint me as some kind of sexuial manic.\n\nI was sexuially abused by a girl in the \"friend group\" that has openly admitted she's addicted to porn and sex and whatever. THE SECOND I tried to open up to someone within the group I thought I could trust, I WAS THE RAPEIST!\n\nTHE BEST PART was when I was PROVEN to absolutely be the victim and still... not a single one has come out to apologize to me, BUT BUT BUT! They continue to say \"ooooh! If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here!\"\nLike, fucking no. No you're not!\n\n\nAt this point it's the people that say they say they are open about sexuially and all that liberal stuff are the least fucking trustworthy.\nIt's frustrating because I am one of those people! My sexuially does not match with what's considered \"normal\" n' all that jazz. But every fucking time I try to be open about it to people that say they are FUCKING USE IT to stab me in the back!\n\n\"He says he's acesexuial, but he masterbates\"\nBitch! First of I said I'm sexindifferent and second YOU LITERALLY POSTED A MEME MINUTES AGO THAT TALK ABOUT HOW JUST BECAUSE YOUR ACE DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T MASTERBATE!\n\n\"He says he's androsexual, but last year he said he was ace.\"\nFFS! You're genderfluid! And gave others shit for not respecting pronouns! You just used he/his on me.\n\n\"Look at him pretending to be a fem-boy\"\nYou're actually trans FTM you POS. How would you feel if I said YOU were pretending.\n\nDon't advocate something you won't practice. \nTHAT is what make you toxic more than anything else.",

When I told the teacher, she didn't do anything. And then when she saw me struggling to even sit on the Chair it was my fault all of a sudden. Luckily the principal was understanding and punished both the girls who did this (I made a huge scene, got angry and threw the chair at the wall which attracted the principal's attention which I had to use to my advantage). That principal left school when I was in 9th grade and a similar thing happened when I was in 10th. Except it wasn't me but my classmate and was kicked out of school for 1 week for doing nothing at all. I swear all the guys in our school are in hell and I've luckily only been in her clutches for 1 year as our school didn't have 11th and is starting this year. But the way this principal behaves is honestly stupid af. Doesn't she understand that it's the girl's fault like ffs look at the situation",

            "comment": "The culture that supports this needs to be dismantled. Early sex education and education on protecting oneself needs to be available in all schools. Abstinence only based programs only add to the rape culture that perpetuates this myth. This whole process starts very early in life. Boys are told not to cry and that having soft emotions is unacceptable. Parents obviously need to be a part of these conversations however we cannot rely on that. All too often, it is a burden for parents to deal with that subject matter. That is the same reason why parents don\u2019t listen when kids report something. It\u2019s much easier to push it away and ignore it. That perpetuates the cycle. Nothing is going to change for victims until the culture changes.  It really disgusts me when I see this typical response to mail rape. I simply do not understand how any female, especially if they have been through it, could think such away.  It is incredibly sad and infuriating that it usually takes a male going through it to get that it\u2019s nothing to be congratulated over or joked about. So many movies use the sexual assault of males as a punchline. That is absolutely horrifying. The way Hollywood depicts sexual assault in general, specifically rape, is very disturbing to begin with.  What we see on TV and in the movies pretty much tells us how to think about this subject matter. Rarely do I see something on film that depicts sexual violence in a realistic way.  They tend to either use the most egregious examples as consumable violence (usually female victims) or they make it a punchline (typically male victims). There are a few exceptions to this rule but not many.  \n\nOne example of this fucked up myth that I think of often is Jimmy Bennett. Asia Argento 100% groomed him for years and then raped him. This made figureheads of the me too movement shake in their boots.  Certain people decided that he was a lucky boy. Others were rightfully infuriated. The details of that incident are incredibly disturbing and even though there turned out to be proof, she denied that they even had sex and then once she was caught, she tried to say that he was the aggressor and that she froze up. People forget that you can absolutely be a victim and a perpetrator at the same time. They talked about how he got money because he sued. He was dismissed and scrutinized just like female victims are even though there was proof. This is only because he is a male. If a 37-year-old man were caught in bed with a 17-year-old girl, we know it would be a different story.",

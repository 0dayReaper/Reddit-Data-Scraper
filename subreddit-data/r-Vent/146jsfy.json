    "postText": "I have just recently realized a pattern in my life. Even when I was younger I noticed people didn\u2019t like me. \n\nPeople always talked about me before they knew me, and even threatened to fight me for reasons I wasn\u2019t sure of. \n\nI would constantly move schools but have the same problems with people.\n\nSome things about me: I am (apparently) a decent looking girl and very outspoken around the right people. \n\nI always took it as a envy thing when people hated me, mainly because it was usually insecure girls who had boyfriends that were interested in me.\n\nOne of my biggest toxic traits is being a attention seeker. It sounds very bad, but let me explain. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t consider it Pick-me behavior it\u2019s more of I talk about myself a lot and hope for people to bring up things I\u2019m interested in so I can talk about myself more. It\u2019s not always a good thing.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not being out front mean, people usually get sick of it and hate me because of it. \n\nI always figured it was because I wear bold clothing and don\u2019t hide what I\u2019m passionate about. \n\nYears of me telling myself I\u2019m not the problem, and they\u2019re just jealous. \n\nI\u2019m not so sure anymore.",

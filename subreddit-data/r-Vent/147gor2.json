    "postText": "Anyone else run into the Evangelical who claims to have evidence of these ridiculous claims of the Old Testament like Genesis with their so called experts who no one agrees with except the fundamentalist? Well here is a Pastor who uses archeology facts and then makes grand jumps to try to claim truths of how the ancient Hebrews fled Egypt (a few million) and wandered the desert for 40 years. Funny how no non fundamentalist historian or archeologist even remotely reached the same conclusion.\n\n[The Exodus That Never Happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-QRjwL2pFI)",

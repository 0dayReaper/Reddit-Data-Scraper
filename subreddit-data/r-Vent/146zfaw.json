I can't get the image out of my head. \n\nLuckily my mom coordinated everyone and we got her to a vet asap.\n\nWhen I was holding my cat down, she still had a fight in her. Tried to bite and scratch me. I know she wil be ok. She has to be ok.\n\nI'm at home waiting for her and my parents to come back. \nTrying to calm down my 8 year old sister.\n\nI feel numb and all I can think about is the blood and my cat wailing and crying.\n\nHer name is Nora, and I love her, and I know she will be ok.",

I have zero idea what happened, but when I left she was her amazing normal self and when I got back she was lethargic, unbalanced and uncoordinated, and seemed totally blind. She didn\u2019t even react to a flashlight in her eyes(pupils didn\u2019t even flinch). It was the scariest thing and I genuinely thought she was going to die. Rushed her to the closest emergency vet an hour away. Cried the entire time. Vet even gave me a private room to cry in while I waited. I 100% thought I was either going home with a body, or  a totally blind cat that wasn\u2019t going to live much longer as I highly suspected a serious neurological issue. Vet found no issues, but informed me that while she wasn\u2019t 100% blind, vision had very rapidly deteriorated over two days. I was devastated. Was given names of specialists. \n\nFast forward to the next day:\n\nShe was fucking fine. 100% normal. Vision, appetite, attitude, everything. Like nothing happened. We still don\u2019t know what it was, or if it will happen again, but it was so fucking scary. I\u2019m glad your baby is okay now though. Reading this just reminded me of my experience and I started crying because ohmygod it sucks when this happens. I hope you\u2019re able to keep us updated and that she stays okay. Sending love, OP, to you and Nora. I\u2019m so sorry this happened.",

I still can't even watch the shows/movies I like. I tried today and it made me want to claw my face off. There's no distraction from the pain. It's ALWAYS there. I can't handle it.

I'm giving it another year, but I'm not going to live in this much pain the rest of my life. It's too much. I can't function. And I don't want to. The whole of my life is disappointment and bad times. There's nothing in my life to support that things get better for me personally. I see them get better for other people, I have never seen them get better for me no matter what good things I do to try to get the good results. I'm too tired and worn down by life. If you're someone in your 20s and you feel this way, please know that the pain will go away for you. Youth is just hard. But I am in my 40s. I've had enough time for things to get better. I'm one of the unlucky ones.",

I also have ample self-esteem. I just have never met someone I made a real deep connection with. I finally found one and I lost it because he didnt want a serious relationship. I've tried medication and it doesn't work. And others in my situation have agreed with me, it didn't work for them either. I've only known medication to work for heartbreak if the person was depressed before the relationship as well.",

But woke up handcuffed to a hospital bed and went in and out of mental hospitals my mom stuck me in every time i cried. Ruined my good job. But i saw the aftermath of the effects on my family. Even though i lived. My mom almost had a heart attack. My sister wrote me a sappy ass letter. I think my niece and nephew colored me pictures. I couldn\u2019t do it to them. I\u2019m pretty pissed that im not selfish enough to check out. Sometimes i wish i was an orphan. But also my dog, he\u2019s my tether. When i think about going, like i did yesterday, i think about him living in a shelter because hes too bonkers to get adopted and a pit bull too. He barks and acts scary and hates children. Also he loves me so much that when i go out of town he wont even eat. He wouldn\u2019t survive wo me. Also my moms sister died last year. She only has one living relative left besides her kids. Shes been drinking herself nearly to death even since. So if i killed myself she definitely would. So its just never as easy as taking yourself out of the equation.",

But let me think\u2026i think i was 17-20. \n\nWhat happened was i was dating a guy and we got a place together. But i was told he had kissed his ex girlfriend. He said he didn\u2019t remember bc he was too drunk but if anything it was a goodbye kiss. Bc he loved me. I had a hard time after that and he got distant. Then i met a guy at my job. He swept me off my feet and i ended up ending my relationship and moving in with him. Was way too fast. My ex begged for me to come back. I was stuck in love with two people. The guy i was with wanted to propose on a trip and i told him not to. I had so much anxiety and depression being in love with two people. Mentally it made sense to stay with the one i was with. He was caring and stable and educated and came from stable family. But how could I marry someone when i was in love with my ex too. I ended up getting back with my ex who then didn\u2019t want me and ripped my heart to shreds. The other guy it was too late to make amends to. I had so much regret. He met up with a childhood friend and ended up getting engaged and they have two children and the perfect life it seems. I lost everything. Both the people i loved. I haven\u2019t found anyone even close to having the feelings for that i had with either of them. Im all alone. And still upset at myself and at the one guy who begged for me back just to drop me like i was nothing. When i couldve been married and have moved to japan which was my dream. I gave it all up.

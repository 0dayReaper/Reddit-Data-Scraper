    "postText": "My daughters dad (very complicated situation still live together and thankfully are very civil) always chooses his wants over her and never values time with her even if he knows he won\u2019t see her for a while. I feel bad for her and for him because I know he is going to feel bad , at least I think he will but maybe I have a false image of him in my head because he keeps messing up with her even when he\u2019s had so many chances. Example we were supposed to leave the state for 2 months yesterday, he is in the military and might not be here when we get back. He knew it was his last night to spend with her and he chose to play his game and drink instead. I felt bad for my daughter and pushed me leaving until tomorrow so he could spend the weekend with her. He went out last night and didn\u2019t come back until after 10am today which is officially his last day with her for who knows how long because we are moving states when we get back. Yet I still feel bad for him because I think he is going to regret his decision.",

What you\u2019re describing in your post is basically a textbook case codependency which is almost always caused by an alcoholic parent(s). If you aren\u2019t already familiar, I would google \u201cAlAnon\u201d and attend a meeting. They are all over and I can guarantee there\u2019s one in your city. It\u2019s filled people just like yourself and they will teach you how to deal with these sorts of people in your life.",

    "postText": "Idk if it\u2019s hormonal or maybe I have bipolar or who tf knows. Maybe I just need to not work as much. It seems like ever since I went back to working full time my mental health has tanked. When I was part time, in therapy, I had time to actually try to improve myself, energy to do the things I love(d). But, I had to take out a $2,000 personal loan to pay my bills and have fall back money in case I couldn\u2019t make enough for the next month. Now I got a promotion and make more, work full time, but I\u2019m severely underpaid and overworked. I make enough to pay bills and have some to spend, but let\u2019s just say that I\u2019m expected to be available by phone m-f from 7am-5pm, even if I\u2019m not working that day. I\u2019m not salary so essentially I provide free labor. If someone can\u2019t come in, I have to come in or help find coverage. It\u2019s a lot. But it looks good on my resume and it pays the bills. But the only times since the promotion that I\u2019ve felt good and could be active in my life and my family and friends\u2019 lives is when I get 3 days off in a row. That doesn\u2019t happen. It physically can\u2019t unless my assistant manager comes in and takes my Friday shift, assuming I don\u2019t have to work Saturday and Sunday (which, surprise, I do if no one else can work it). So those rare 3 day weekends mean less money for me, but at least 3-5 days of feeling fucking good. The rest of the month is shit. Still in therapy but it\u2019s hard to make progress when all I can think about is work. Did everything come in on the orders, did we reach sales goal, someone is texting me because yet another machine broke. Someone messed up their deposit. Someone forgot to clock in. Someone is quitting, this person needs coverage. It never fucking ends. And what do I make??? Only 2 fucking .50 over minimum wage. I get tips but business has been slow, probably because of the shitty cost of living here. No holiday pay. 80 hours of PTO but good luck getting it approved with a short staff. So now what?? Look for a new job to suck the life out of me again? I think I just shouldn\u2019t work full time because of mental health reasons but part time isn\u2019t an option unless it\u2019s a crazy good pay. I\u2019m so fucking tired of this.",

    "postText": "Every single day i lose hours of my life to delusions and hallucinations. I wake up and the first thing i do is fall right back into the little stories i create in my head. I pace around my room for hours in scilence or listening to music talking to myself and pretending theres other people there. Its gotten to the point where im hallucinating things form these scenarios and seeing the world as if it was these stories. Ive started accidentally calling real people by these imaginary characters names, ill lay awake at night paranoied that im being watched or filmed because of them. Anything that happens my brain goes to turn it into a fictional story inside my head. Ive lost friends over this. Most of my day ends up wasted sitting in my room because i cant stop thinking about these daydreams and its ruining me. I just wish it would stop but at the same time it gives me comfort. What scares me is that its the way i cope with so many things so i dont think i could stop even if i wanted to. I dont know what to do at this point.",

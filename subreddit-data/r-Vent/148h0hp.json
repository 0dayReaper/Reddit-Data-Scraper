    "postText": "I used to think there was jus somethin wrong wit me, but truth is I\u2019m traumatized af, been living in a physical and mental shock since the age of 8. \n\nI was SA\u2019d, that\u2019s why my period came so early. A lot of doctors revolt when I say 8. Yes, at 8 years old I was being SA\u2019d and it forced my hormones and puberty to come way sooner than planned. I never connected that dot before, because so many girls start puberty young and it\u2019s been normalized, but it is not normal at all. It\u2019s quite fucking alarming when you peep the reason why. My mother did not know why, but she did start to notice something was wrong with me. She tried to get me help, but my father said no I was fine. Hahahaha. \n\nThe disruption of entering womanhood so early, with my child body that was not prepaped at all, my brain and everything, sent me into a mental disruption. I\u2019m not sure exactly what, but I know that\u2019s fact. Combine that with being abused and that\u2019s when my soul became disturbed, depressed, anxious, PTSD. I was scared to be seen by people, maybe because being SA\u2019d made me want to hide from being seen so I wouldn\u2019t be touched, idk. I understand my anxiety has also stemmed from my parents and my extended family, their shaming, their bullying, embarassing me in public, not pouring into my emotional needs enough when I began to act out and experience trauma. \n\nI give my mother props for trying but my dad did not let her for some reason, but I wish she would\u2019ve done it for me sooner anyway despite his word, but my parents were religious then, well my mom was my dad still is, and in Islam men are superior to women so they have to listen\ud83d\ude44 thanks religion. \n\nReligion also kept my parents conveniently absent. Which is how a lot of bs was able to transpire. My parents were not THERE, they were not PAYING ATTENTION, they were SELF ABSORBED and SELF INVOLVED despite having a house of children that was more important than any religion. Not saying this is religion fault no it\u2019s my parents fault. They failed. They did. They were not focused on what was most important smh there was so much shit going down in their faces, in their presence. \n\nIf they were in tune with us then they would\u2019ve known but parents and children are usually always so distant from each other, the parents stop LIKING and LOVING the child after they\u2019re a certain age like 6 and 7, because we\u2019re not as cute no more we can talk back and express ourselves and adults have hated that about children since the dawn of fucking time lmao. That\u2019s why when we speak of trauma we go back to the childhood home. We are suppressed by adults because they don\u2019t want to deal with us anymore. \n\nThis is bringing back up a lot of really really gut wrenching moments from my childhood, so I\u2019m going to stop before I fully trigger myself. My childhood was very sad and dark, and maybe that\u2019s why I struggle to remember it because I don\u2019t want to. \n\nBut this also makes me think like imagine if boys had menstrual periods. The known amount of boys being SA\u2019d would skyrocket. The numbers would be up there, the exposure would be crazy. \n\nCause what is one indicator a girl is being SA\u2019d? Her period. When her period starts, when she first begins to menstruate. Well why does SA bring forth menstruation? Because SA awakens the hormones that were not supposed to be awaken until the body was naturally ready. The body was not naturally ready, it was forced by outside energies. And these hormones are to prepare the young girl for motherhood. \n\nBoys do not have these physical attributes to them, they don\u2019t bleed, they don\u2019t have cramps, they don\u2019t get more fat in their chest, so it\u2019s much less noticeable. \n\nIt\u2019s just so terrible when you think about it. \nJust think of all the boys being SA\u2019d but it doesn\u2019t show like how it does for girls. This is why we can\u2019t treat girls and boys the same because then we miss crucial shit like this, and the window to save them gets closed. \n\nCause if I was being SA\u2019d, then what about my brothers too???",

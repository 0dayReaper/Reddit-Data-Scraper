It's the first game since New Vegas to have me this invested, interested, and obsessed.",

I really want to play it, but I suck real bad at fast paced gun combat (idk why but guns mess me up, it took me forever to be able to get past the first several quests in Fable 2 because of the guns). I saw a preview and I couldn't tell what the combat would be like to actually play it. Any insight would be very much appreciated",

The gunplay is nothing to write home about, but it's serviceable enough to get things done.\n\nThat being said, Cyberpunk opens more options than just point-and-shoot. Melee is absolutely a viable way to play the game, either via stealth or just by being able to rush people faster than they can attack you (of course, this becomes more difficult when enemies are in groups.) You also have the option of netrunning/quickhacking, which will effectively allow you to attack enemies without actually attacking them, and you can even attack them from security cameras. It's the closest thing to magic you can get in this game.\n\nIf you do get the game and continue to be bad at overall combat, I would focus on netrunning as your primary damage source, and keep a shotgun/grenades on hand for if anybody gets close. Shotguns will ragdoll enemies at close range, and you can either shoot them to death or grenade spam until they die.",

Better to release it with as few bugs as possible, and without absolutely destroying your team in the process. \n\nThis launch isn't nearly as bad as others I've seen from the mega game corporations such as EA, and this is considered an early release. Anthem and Battlefield 3 were early release too and just... absolutely ATROCIOUS. Both had significant, highlighted features that outright didn't work at launch. If you could play the games at all!",

A real bomb of a release was/is Fallout 76. They weren't even rushed and still to this day haven't made the game acceptable. CDPR has a good product that needs minor fixes on console and PC.",

The cool thing with Stadia is you don't need to sign up for Stadia, just need a Gmail account. You can buy Cyberpunk and play at 1080 for two hours, if you like it on the service you can either keep playing at the 1080 quality, or pay for Stadia Pro at $9.99 US  for 4K 60fps (plus a ton of free monthly pro games). All games are playable on your mobile device (side note: Google is working on a safari based app).\n\nIf you don't like the service you can refund the game within 2 hours and you have lost nothing. As an added bonus if you buy Cyberpunk through Google Stadia you receive a free Stadia Premier Edition bundle, a $99 value (until December 17th).",

He has to be disappointed with the gaming population for the actions of the ill tempered.\n\n\n\n\nIt is buggy, I play it on PC, the worst one is sometimes in the later part of the story after you get the fancy clothes per plot, the supporting characters talk but theres no voices and their mouths don't move, thank the gods the subtitles are on.\n\n\n\n But I understand that there are bugs and I'm not very bothered about it. It will get fixed and I can be patient, after all every single person on this project worked their butts off and were rushed by others, yes it was 8 years in the making but some ahole up the chain of command said \"make it next gen ready\" and ruined much of their progress late in development.

Are you seriously suggesting that in order for a trans person to be valid they must identify as trans, not male/female/non-binary? \n\nAs for the game being about seeing the world through V's eyes, you do realize that would be the same no matter what body, genital, and voice combo you chose, right? Like just cause a female voiced V with tits and dick doesn't comment on transness doesn't mean that a male voiced V with dick and no tits is magically gonna talk about it.\n\nBut really none of this fucking matters. You don't like the game, goody for you, here's your fucking cookie. Go write your blog and forget all about this in a month when the next thing that outrages you has occurred. If it pisses you off so much then contact your therapist so you can understand why you think being hateful online will somehow magically decrease the amount of hate online.",

If you don't like the videogame just move the fuck on. People are so snowflakey in the last 20 years. Just move the fuck on nobody cares if you're offended over something to not be offended about in a fake ass game, that's as far from reality as possible.",

They then proceeded to push that date back twice, which understandably made their fan base mad (not justifying the death threats in the slightest, but I definitely see why people were so mad). Then they released the game after 7-8 years of work, knowing it was still unfinished. At least in my opinion, they brought all of this on themselves. Still in no way defending the way fans have gone about this, but CDPR are the ones who screwed themselves here. Still a decent game however, but they shouldn\u2019t have even given this game a release date to begin with if it was gonna turn out like this",

Theres no excuse why the product is at the quality it is at especially when CPR hasn't been transparent letting reviewers post their b-roll and feedback transparently until the release of the game.

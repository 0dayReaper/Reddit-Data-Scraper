    "postText": "So I met this girl, we talked, flirted a bit, and I finally asked her out, we even kissed a couple of times. Then a few weeks later said she didn't want this, she said she was attracted to me and everything, was just worried that she would screw things up or something I don't know, didn't want to make her uncomfortable so we decided to end things, stat as friends. Except I realized I was an idiot and wanted her back, but she had already found a new boyfriend all on less than one week.\n\nSo I stayed friends, trying not to let it bother me. It bothered me, I blew up in talk with about something stupid and fucked up our friendship, tried to recover the friendship didn't work. I was trying to deal with all this feelings, lashing out at her, trying to be friends again, and finally decided to talk to her about what I was feeling and letting it all out. She didn't want to though, said it made her uncomfortable, so she told me to say everything I wanted to say by text. So I did, feeling like a weight has been lifted off my chest, but something was still there, like I cant fully take in a deep breath of air.\n\nI realize what was bothering me afterward, that she came out of this for the better. It wasn't a big deal for her, because she still has a boyfriend and her friends and I've got nobody. She literally told me that she doesn't want to see my face, not for at least a year, like I can't even have a face to face to properly end things.\n\n And it pisses me off, and I can't tell her anything about this because I said I wouldn't talk to her again. Now I'm venting at 2:00 in the morning, hoping I can deal with this shit, because I heard it helps.\n\nIs there anything I can do, anything at all, because I might run into her in a few days. Or do I ignore this and just try and life happy.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this man. I know how painful and lonely not having people to talk to can be. If it makes you feel better, I can almost guarantee you that she didn\u2019t come out of this situation better than before. It seems as though since she can\u2019t even see you and talk to you face to face, she\u2019s still got struggles that she\u2019s gonna have to go through and resolve on her own. Obviously idk what was said during your argument, but I know that I have said some really nasty, shameful, and regretful things to someone I treasured dearly. I lost him as a friend and I loved him in both the platonic and romantic ways. We ended up being civil with each other but never friends again and it hurt so bad for a long time. Now it\u2019s been a couple years since then and life has changed so much that while I still remember him and the hurt I caused the both of us, it doesn\u2019t hurt me anymore. If things end up with you guys like it did for me, just know it\u2019s gonna be ok in the long run. Our emotions change in seconds and they\u2019re powerful feelings, but to get through them you\u2019ve just gotta focus on the big picture of your life. Friends come and go and as painful as it is, 99% of the time, those fallouts shape and mold people into better versions of themselves. Idk if your religious but if you believe in God, pray for Him to take your worries and burdens from you, and pray for His guidance in what He has planned, for its better than any life we could plan for ourselves. I\u2019ll be praying that He leads you to a life where you\u2019re surrounded by those you love and those who love you back. Just keep trecking on through life man, it\u2019s a crazy journey, painful sometimes, but I promise there is joy, happiness and comfort everywhere around you, sometimes you just gotta find the right people who will show you that!",

As a girl myself, there\u2019s a pretty good chance that she\u2019s talking about you and sending SS of your convos to her friends. That\u2019s just my opinion if you wanted to keep the matter private going forward",

The worst thing is, I feel like I need to know if they came out of this for the better or worse, I need closure. I don't know if this makes me a bad person, but I really need to feel like I'm not the only one who feels like crap. You understand what I'm saying. I want a face to face but she doesn't. I don't know if I can properly move on without it.",

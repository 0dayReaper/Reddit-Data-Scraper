    "postText": "yeah i know that\u2019s pretty jarring to introduce it all like that but, i\u2019m on a study abroad in jordan studying arabic. it\u2019s been a great trip and i won\u2019t let a break up ruin it for me as much as it has challenged me (and when i tell you it has, it REALLY has).\n\ni\u2019m not innocent in our relationship and i just couldn\u2019t satisfy my ex\u2019s needs in a relationship because i could barely take care of myself. hindsight is 20/20 of course but i think being more matured because of this relationship i\u2019ll know how whether i am ready for one in the future. this last relationship (i thought) was so beautiful. it made me realize i had so much love for life even though i was struggling as well. i think i did really love my ex. she was unique in a way that was special to me, but i don\u2019t think she ever really loved me.\n\nagain, hindsight is 20/20 but damn i should\u2019ve picked up on some red flags at the beginning. we moved pretty fast early on. she was the one who asked me out after we had been hanging out a decent amount and she told me she loved me first. despite all that, i think i was just an escape from the real world for her. she definitely put in so much effort into the relationship to be with me and see me and love me, although i definitely didn\u2019t do as much as i should\u2019ve. now that we\u2019re broken up, a mutual friend of ours told she said she loved me but that she was not in love with me. \n\ndoes she even care that we\u2019re broken up? that i hurt? does she hurt? did we mean anything to her? she\u2019s literally talking up a new person and fucking that same one plus another. i know people process differently but she still talks to me in a friendly way, as if nothing happened. am i insane for thinking that she doesn\u2019t care?",

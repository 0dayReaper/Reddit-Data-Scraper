    "postText": "(no sexual assault mentioned, just emotional/financial abuse)\nI would love nothing more than to move out of my parents house, and they SAY they want me to move out, but their actions don't match their words. I am actively saving for a used car as the car I've been using is a piece of crap and could break down at any moment. I make ~950 a paycheck (every 2 weeks) and save 500 per paycheck for the car. so around 1000 a month. the rest of my money essentially goes to my parents for car/phone/health insurance and rent. that's ~400 a month. I have zero access to my debit card (it's in my parents safe) and it's set up so weekly, 70 gets sent to my dad and he gives me an envelope of 70 cash for my weekly spending money. \ntoday I told my parents I wanted to go to a music event downtown with my friends, and I was open to being a DD (since I'd never be able to afford drinks anyways), but I probably couldn't take my car that far. so my question to them was if I could borrow one of their other 3 cars to drive my friends to and from the event. what the conversation turned into was how I couldn't afford the $17 ticket. I told them I'd pay for it with my cash (I'd have one of my friends buy it and I'd pay her back in cash), and they told me that wasn't the point. they said I needed to save so both my savings and checking would build up. I questioned what that had to do with anything as I'd use the weekly $70. they kept telling me that it's the principle, I have to save for a car, I have to pay my bills, etc. I pointed out that I have no trouble paying my bills aside from the new phone I traded in and have to pay my dad back for. however, the phone comes out in $15 monthly increments and I've already paid him ~150 so I'm way ahead of paying him back. I said if I paid it all at once, my account would be overdrawn and they've threatened me if my account gets overdrawn. I mentioned that if I bought a $17 shirt we wouldn't be having this conversation. then my sister came over to swim and since we had been yelling and I was crying and I didn't want her to see me, I just went to my room and cried and slept for the next 8 hours until it was time for my night shift. I told my friends about how In not able to go and realized that the reason I don't get to hang out with them very often anymore is because my parents pretty much dictate my life when it comes to where I can go in the car and what I can spend my money on. 2 of my friends don't invite me anywhere anymore because they know I won't be able to go anyways. I didn't want to see or talk to my parents, but I had to grab my backpack from the room they were in and my mom said cheerily \"hi OP!\" I ignored her, clearly still upset, and rushed down the hall and she said \"OP are you okay?\" that upset me more because it's like she's ignoring the problem and completely invalidating my feelings. I just wanna pack up everything and move across the country where my gf lives and just never speak to them again. but everything I know is here, so I just need a roommate but the only person I wanna live with is my gf who, again, lives across the country. this is just a fraction of the abuse they've put me through my entire life. and they've never treated any of my older siblings this way.\n\nTLDR; my parents control my financials and it affects my relationships and my overall mental health and I'd move and go NC with them but everything I know is here.",

    "postText": "My new boyfriend has come into my life at the worst possible moment. I started having epileptic seizures again. And they are the worst they have ever been and I\u2019ve gotten back on the meds. \n\nThis medication makes me so emotional. Depressed, angry episodes, tiredness, moodswings. I\u2019ve been hiding the brunt of it. My depression has been terrible, we\u2019ve had crazy fights. I just feel like I tried to explain to him the anger thing, but I didn\u2019t walk him through the really bad side effects which is why I got off the medication in the first place. \n\nNow I\u2019m starting to have paranoid thoughts. About him\u2026 and our relationship. I\u2019m literally on the verge of crying for no reason tonight. I wish I could call him. Talk about it. But I just feel myself becoming so anxious in his presence. Withdrawing and being so awkward. Like we\u2019re strangers. \n\nHe asked me if I was happy.  I said I was and I asked him if he was happy and he said yes. But I feel like because he asked me it means he\u2019s not. I have been hiding my depression and my sadness. I just keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. He\u2019s not a reassuring guy. He\u2019s very reserved with his emotions. He doesn\u2019t express deeper emotions often.\n\nI see his efforts. \n\n\nBut I\u2019m so sick right now. A year ago I was everything he would\u2019ve wanted. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I can ever be her again. \n\nI don\u2019t want him stuck with me. \nI want him to leave.",

            "comment": "You don\u2019t want him stuck with you huh. Why that\u2019s an odd way to say that. Look you have epileptic seizures, and depression. Maybe also the anger thing, but this does not make you less of a person. You say you don\u2019t want him stuck with you as if you see yourself as some kind of parasite in his life. You\u2019re not. You\u2019re a person just like him and having a relationship and having somebody by your side while you\u2019re going through this might actually be comforting. If he actually loves you he\u2019ll be willing to deal with all of those things because they\u2019re not your fault and he probably (hopefully) knows that.",

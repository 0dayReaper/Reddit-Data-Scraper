    "postText": "im a 14 year old girl. i went to the fair with my friend and we were walking one direction and an older man (im unsure of age i think in mid 20s-mid 30s?) was walking the opposite direction to me. he walked past and stopped me and had a huge grin on his face. he asked for my name and i gave it to him and deep down i knew something was wrong (this is the first time this has happened to me with an older person)  so I started to slowly walk where I was going to. he then asked for where i live and I could see his hand move slowly towards my shoulder and then i started to walk quicker. after this interaction i was laughing with my friend but as im writing this im in tears. i realise now that it\u2019s scared me and I\u2019m scared. i don\u2019t actually know if this interaction has a name. im just scared.",

If he was a nice person (who was making a bad mistake in treating you this way, because, honestly, no one should treat you this way), when he thinks about it later, he would be GLAD that you said nothing and ran away. He\u2019ll think you were being sensible.\n\nYou did nothing wrong: you were very good, and you followed your instincts. I\u2019m proud of you.",

Avoid talking to them especially if your gut is screaming. That gut is telling you that it detects danger.\n\nThis was the first time that it happened to you, it unfortunately won't be the last time. The older you get the less it will occur (last time it happened to me I was 29). Tell your parents about what happened, they need to know. Do absolutely call the police if someone is following you or trying to pressure you into a conversation(for example \"why aren't you telling me your name? I'm X, I just want to be friends.\") or keeping you from getting away. If you cannot call the police run to the nearest shop, petrol station or whatever and tell them what's going on and to call the police.",

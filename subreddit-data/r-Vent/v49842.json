    "postText": "I(18f) have had a rocky relationship with my parents for as long as I can remember. My parents are stuck in the 1700s and they think that a woman\u2019s only purpose is to cook, clean, and have kids and because of this they have always treated me lesser to my siblings (I am the only daughter out of 6 kids.) So, when the topic of college came up they told me they would not be contributing at all as they don\u2019t believe a woman should go to college. Instead they want me to find a husband asap and start having kids. I on the other hand want to go to college in Europe and travel the world. So, a couple months ago I booked a flight to Paris and have decided to backpack around Europe for the summer until college starts. I have secretly saved up lots of cash from jobs and investing over the years as well as an inheritance I got from my grandma (about 20k.) I\u2019m really excited however I feel so guilty everytime I\u2019m by my family as I know that in 2 days I will be leaving and never coming back. What should I do? I know I have to tell them that I\u2019m leaving but how and when?\n\nUpdate: so, I\u2019ve just had the hardest 24 of my life. I\u2019m also going to be simplifying this a lot. Yesterday at 6:00pm I packed my final things, told my parents I was staying the night at my friends and I wouldn\u2019t be back till dinner the next day, and gave my brothers a final goodbye. My friends then picked me up to go out for a going away party for me. Then, after the party I got back to my friends house where I stayed the night at and then at 4am I left home for my flight. Once I was boarding my flight I texted my best friend, (who has a key to my house) to go into my house and leave the note explaining everything on my bed. (My family wasn\u2019t home, they were all at church) Once I turned off my airplane mode I was flooded with hundreds of missed calls and texts; all from my family asking if this was some kind of joke. All I replied with was a picture of me at the airport with all my bags, which I sent to my mom, and then put my phone on do not disturb. I am writing this at the US embassy in Paris rn while sorting out all the paperwork. It\u2019s so pretty here in Europe (although Paris is a little more dirty then I thought) and I can\u2019t believe this is my life!!! As always, I\u2019ll keep u guys updated!",

But: You have to be aware, that we got direct democracy here. That means, we have to vote about everything, 4x times per year we vote directly on topics.\n\nLike for example, we had to approve the corona rules twice. We had to approve Gay-Marriage and many other things, the parliament can't just enact or stop laws. Because of that system, the political progression is very slow and takes years, but it's also the system that gives citizens the most influence. You can initiate votings and change the constitution of the country, it's the only place in the world where you can do that.\n\nToday, it's not different for women than any other Western Europe countries.\n\nUnfortunately about paperwork: That's the thing in almost all countries here.

I was so lucky that my parents and family never pushed a specific future on me. Never said \"why aren't you married yet?\" or \"when are you going to have a child?\" I wouldn't have been able to listen to such nonsense. Ugh! I never really cared either way about marriage. If I got married, fine. If I never did? Also fine. As for children? I love kids but I never had any of my own. There's some regret there but I'll live",

In all honesty, I\u2019d completely advise against going to New York. It\u2019s a beautiful city, absolutely, but the expenses are a nightmare and they\u2019re only trending upwards rather than down. Crime wise, things are certainly getting worse too. I\u2019m not familiar with Chicago though, which could end up being super welcoming. Honestly though, with the Roe v Wade fiasco going on and more of our rights being in jeopardy, I\u2019m looking to leave the country. Germany and Switzerland seem like great options for something like that, and plus, there\u2019s always Canada.\n\nPlease, be careful on your trip though and try to avoid going to places alone if you can. I\u2019ve seen other people in the replies mention trafficking quite a lot, and that\u2019s a real danger for people our age traveling alone like this. Stay safe out there OP, and best of luck on this travel of yours",

After all, this is Jim Jordan territory and Mitch is right across the river.  Throw a rock and you'll hit at least 4 huge pickup trucks with militia stickers or confederate flags. Its widely known that at least one or two klan lodges are in the area where I currently live. \n\nI consider myself one of the lucky ones who \"got out of mayberry.\" Was able to get myself away from the small town hillbilly ignorance, but now I live in affluent suburban ignorance. Only difference between the two is better dental care and less rust on the trucks.\n\nBest of luck in your adventures! So if you're leaving in 2 days I guess that means you're leaving Sunday? Very appropriate, hit the road while they're all at church praising the hellfire and brimstone.\n\nAnd as others have said, STAY SAFE and NEVER let your guard down. Before you even set foot out of the airport in Paris, get the location of the US embassy saved in your phone and ALWAYS know how to get there from wherever you are in the city. Since you're American that's the safe haven you can run to if shit hits the fan. Repeat this process for each country you go to.\n\nAnd PLEASE update when you get there and document your adventures! Seriously, this is the makings of some kick-ass travel blog shit!",

I joined Americorps when I turned 18 because my mom basically undermined me and enrolled me in a college I didn't want, simply because she didn't want me leaving the state. She chose my major and fucking everything behind my back somehow and tried to manipulate me into staying home while at school. \n\nBy joining Americorps, I figured I'm volunteering! If it happens to send me out-of-state, oh man, whatever shall I do, mother? I did all that also without telling either of my parents until I already had a contract and apartment set up out of state. \n\nI get your drive fully and support it 100% it was the best decision I made.

You shouldn't have to do this, but unfortunately you have to do so to escape.\n\nYou're making the correct decision, and Europe is a much safer place for women right now it seems. Run, learn freely, and have fun. \n\nAs others have said, do not leave that letter in your home. If they find it before you're gone, they may very well stop you from leaving. Being from where you are, the authorities will likely side with and believe your parents over you. Do not tell anyone that you haven't already until you are safely to your destination, nor send the letter. If you decide to mail the letter from your destination, be sure not to leave a return address. Alternatively, you may choose to have the friend helping you leave hold on to the letter until you're there. Though even that is risky, if your friend's parents were to find it and tell yours.",

Again, my personal experience. Which is not yours! \nThe world is just such a scary, scary place &amp; I worry for you &amp; all young women. I just went thru sooooooo many horrifying things, simply bc I thought I knew it all at that age, and if I\u2019d have listened or knew better yet, I wouldn\u2019t have had to. Let me reiterate - that is only personal. Definitely not everyone has these problems being alone so young!! I wish you the best &amp; have no intentions to offend. Just be cautious, OP",

Having a child is not reversible, and both your body and mind will never be the same.",

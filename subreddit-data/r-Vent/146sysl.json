    "postText": "I've always felt lonely but lately the feelings are getting stronger. Everyday I see people hanging out with their friends and enjoying, it makes me feel empty. I've shifted schools and I've been in my current school for 6 years now and I don't have any friends there. I have some great parents man, they tell me I'll be alright but I'm going insane. I'm so sad, pissed that all I can do is stay quiet. I've tried going out alone too to freshen up my mood, but it just gets worse. I can't sleep at night either, i don't know what the reason is but maximum i get 4 hours of sleep within 2 days. I've tried to make friends so many fucking times, but they mostly make me feel like shit. All I do is just sit in my room and watch movies or sleep. That's it, I want to feel excited too or something other than all the fucking negative emotions.",

            "comment": "Same bro. I used to have friends but I moved schools too many times and started smoking weed and then just staying home and smoking weed playing video games all day everyday since I was like 13. Now I\u2019m 19 don\u2019t have any friends at all, starting to become strangers to my 2 cousins I grew up with and are literally like my brothers, never had a girlfriend, a virgin, and broke asf I don\u2019t even have a car or anything. I just got this job at Walmart tho and it made me realize I\u2019ll be able to do things that\u2019ll make me happy even if I don\u2019t have friends. I\u2019m planning on buying a ps5, a car, some gym equipment, and other stuff so I actually have stuff to do because I usually just sit around on Reddit and YouTube all day since I have literally nothing better to do. But once I get a PlayStation and some gym equipment I\u2019ll have 2 things to do. We just gotta keep ourselves busy and occupied as possible, and also try to interact with humans even if they aren\u2019t your friends cuz even a quick small-talk conversation with a stranger can cure your loneliness for a bit.",

Your posture does play a big role whether people see you as just bitchy/angry/ depressed or confident.  If you work on anything, make it posture and the way you walk.  Being swarmed with attention sounds absolutely exhausting.  Quality over quantity will always give you better results.",

If you\u2019re giving off a \u201cdon\u2019t talk to me\u201d vibe, most guys can read that. And that\u2019s not always an rbf face either. \n\nIf you want to be approached and you want to be talked to, just have confidence in yourself. How do you gain confidence in yourself? A lot of work on yourself, especially since you seem to have been putting yourself down for years. \n\nLast note, I think you\u2019re attractive in your pictures and most people commenting seem to agree. However, not everyone is going to find you attractive, that\u2019s just how it is. You don\u2019t want to end up with someone you\u2019re attracted to, but they aren\u2019t attracted to you. \n\nThere\u2019s a small overlap of \u201cpeople you are attracted to\u201d and \u201cpeople who are attracted to you\u201d and that\u2019s the sweet spot. Basically, there will always be people that find you attractive. You don\u2019t need to change yourself to please anyone, just be comfortable with yourself.",

I am sure there are all kinds of wonderful, kind and handsome men who would love to go out with you. \n\nI mean I took a look at your profile and honestly, you look great. I think the only issue is that you don't embrace it.  \n\nPeople often mistake narcissism for confidence. Confidence is being comfortable in your own skin.\n\nIt's the oldest advice but it's the best advice, be happy in being yourself.",

    "postText": "To cover the basics \n-A and I started talking in early April \n-He had just broken up with his girlfriend of 4 years in January and is trying to meet new people \n-Said he was ready to move on but evidently isn\u2019t yet. (Admitted she broke it off and he wanted to continue)\n-A week ago, blocked his ex on everything and said he\u2019s properly going to try to move on \n- I was the first person he told this to, and when things seem to go wrong in his life, he comes to me. \n\nHonestly\u2026A and I have really good chemistry. And I really REALLY like him. But a lot of times it hurts talking to him. He says he loves talking to me, thought about kissing me after our date, I\u2019m the first person he thinks about coming to when things go wrong etc. But most of the time I can barely read him. Like I want to feel valued and liked. And it doesn\u2019t feel that way. I\u2019m clinging on to this amazing chemistry we have but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna be moving on from his ex anytime soon. I want to be compliments and made to feel important. I want to be told I\u2019m beautiful and be taken on cute dates. Treated like a lil princess and to feel special. But I just don\u2019t get that sense with him. I know he\u2019s still dealing with moving on and I don\u2019t want to rush him. But if I\u2019m talking to a guy, a guy I like? I want to feel all those good things and get that love and attention in return. Even though I\u2019m a place of comfort to him and he might see me as a potential love interest. I need to actually feel it, instead of feeling ignored 3/4 of the time,,, or just not really important. If he\u2019s not ready that\u2019s okay, but if we\u2019re going to keep talking everyday\u2026 I want to actually feel worth something, instead of like a potential side piece. Chemistry be damned it\u2019s not worth feeling unimportant. Like seriously\u2026 an once of love, attention, care? \n\nWe\u2019re going to talk about it tomorrow. If he\u2019s not ready that\u2019s okay\u2026 but I don\u2019t think I can wait till he is and feeling like a a friend he likes to find comfort in when things get tough. \n\nEveryone\u2019s telling me this isn\u2019t unreasonable and it\u2019s okay. But a part of me feels bad.",

I wish my family would just admit that I'm a lost cause and stop hurting themselves by being around me.\n\nI'm a toxic person. I don't deserve the air that I breathe. My pets are more human than I'll ever be.\n\nI wish my dad would just beat the shit out of me like he's threatened to. At least I would get a tiny bit of what I deserve.\n\nI keep choosing to hurt people. I wish that option would be taken away.",

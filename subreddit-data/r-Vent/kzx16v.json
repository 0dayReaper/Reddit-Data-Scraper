Even if it's only 40 days, her integrity as a person within society is ruined publicly now by serving time. Every job, credit check, loan application, etc. she will have to state that she is a convicted abuser. Serves her right. Stay safe OP!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: spelling error",

If you have social media like Facebook, it's hard to avoid all your childhood friends and family.   One wrong move, sharing a phone number or email with them  or using a new app  can reveal your location. Theres a ton of apps for android and iPhone meant for parents to keep an eye on their kids that get used as stalkerware.  Your abuser can even watch your every move on your camera if they decide to make the effort to learn.   So 40 days is great, I'm so happy  that he won, but if the abuser does not learn their lesson and it is ongoing it's not nearly enough time to move and change your identity to shake yourself free from someone who continues to perpetuate abuse.  There are programs where you can legally change your identity, even your social, but you have to make a clean break online from those you live from the past.",

And it happens in every culture, on every continent, through time. I wish it didn't, I wouldn't have suffered horrible abuse, others wouldn't have either.\n\n\nTo make light of the abuse and play with words that have no meaning is slimy and weak of you. You disgust me and everyone that has read your comments you vile troll.",

Grow up and stop joking about abuse on a post from someone who was genuinely abused. You have the mindset of a 14 year old, and you probably are one. If not I feel very bad for your family, having to raise such a disappointment.",

Those people are not \"parents\", they're pathetic, irredeemable and shitty excuses for parents. There's a difference between disrespecting your parents for no reason and hating them because they abused you.\n\nIf all of my assumptions are wrong, then explain what your post was made to mock, explain or otherwise joke about. It's literally impossible to respect your parents when they abuse the ever living hell out of you. Especially after 15 years of abuse. Again, put yourself in OP's shoes and think about it.",

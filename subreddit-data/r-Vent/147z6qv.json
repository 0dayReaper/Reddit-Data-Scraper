It was like 3 police (fully geared up) and 2 FBI agents that came to my house.\n\nI was at my beach house for vacation when they came to my home. Fortunately I wasn\u2019t there.\n\nI had to come to the FBI for questioning. \n\nThe investigation turned from a school shooting to sexual harassment. But for some reason the guy pressed harassment charges and emotional abuse on me for rejecting him, like WHAT??",

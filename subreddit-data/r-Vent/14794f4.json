When i close my eyes i can only picture him in front of me. The only time i feel okay is when i sleep, because he\u2019s nice to me in my dream. I\u2019m so sorry to him. I know i have to give it time but god i\u2019ve been through heartbreak once and going through it again sounds impossible. i really don\u2019t know if i can do this. nothing will be the same again.",

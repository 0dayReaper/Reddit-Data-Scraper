    "postText": "i wish people got punishment for treating you badly. my ex waged emotional warfare on me. he lied and led me on. for 2 years since he dumped me i\u2019ve been indebted to him. my whole life on pause. i haven\u2019t even talked to him or had a meaningful conversation with him in these 2 years aside from the occasional begging for answers and closure about why he lied to me and pretended to love me. his only answer is that i\u2019m crazy. he said IM the one who abandoned him. are you kidding me? he lied about loving me and turned all my friends against me. it\u2019s complete BULLSHIT dhat he could say IM THE ONE who abandoned him. i didn\u2019t abandon him he abandoned me. he wrecked my ability to ever trust anyone again. i love him. i love him so much. he said that i should\u2019ve gotten over it by now. what???? i woudlnt have anything to get over if he didn\u2019t treat me like his personal emotional punching bag. i hate him. i hate him. he unblocked me and texted me the other day trying to come back into my life. how dare he? how can he hurt me the way he hurt me and still try to come back into my life?? how can he think that\u2019s acceptable? i love him so much. i would do anything to be with him again. i\u2019m so pathetic that i\u2019m even entertaining this idea of being his friend. i know that this is going to set me back all the progress i\u2019ve made this past 2 years trying to get over him. when i think about him i feel nauseous. i hate him. he hurt me so much so why am i so pathetic that i still love him and why is he looming over every single part of my life despite not even caring about me? how can i give him so much power? what rhe hell is the matter with me? i hate him. i am so ducking angry. i haven\u2019t expressed any anger in the past 20 years i\u2019ve been alive and im reaching my breaking point. i hate him. i\u2019ll never forgive him. i hope he\u2019s never happy ever again. how could he do thsi to me? i gave him everythitn i had. he ruined my life",

    "postText": "\n\ntldr:  I did tumbling and I broke down my bone,  had a messed up surgery,  then proceeded to be mistreated my medical professionals and I now can never play sports again. \n\nI (16F) am a \u201cretired\u201d power tumbler,  I did it for 7 years before ultimately quitting.  I was involved in the USTA (United States Tumbling Association) where I competed at my highest at intermediate level.  I did tumbling for 7 whole years, and I couldn\u2019t even do a standing backflip by myself because of my coaches.   My coaches NEVER pushed me. It was always the same thing. Over. And over. And OVER again. I never said anything because I thought this was normal, and I was moving at a good pace,  I, infact,  was going slower than a three toed sloth.   No one ever taught me new skills above a back handspring,  and a front tuck, which I learned as a seven year old, and were some  of the hardest skills I competed. I taught myself how to do a back tuck, I taught myself how to do a front half on double mini (a type of trampoline) I taught myself how to do almost everything,  all they would do is clean it up.  I was the second best in the state the last year I competed. I went to nationals for god sake! No one ever pushed me above my limits to make me a better gymnast. I had to learn almost everything by myself because no one else would. \nI eventually quit when I got into 7th grade all together because I knew that I was wasting my time.  I also had really bad flat feet, so I was always hurting them. \nI then proceeded to play volleyball,  where I was an aggressive middle hitter with my small frame, but man could I jump.  I was a strong power forward in basketball,  I wasn\u2019t afraid to get beat up,  was the only one who could actually rebound the damn ball.  I was an explosive shotput and discus thrower,   in sixth grade I was throwing 70 feet in discus against seventh graders,  and was throwing 25 feet in shotput.  I had a mean arm in softball,  could throw from the fence to home with amazing accuracy. \nWell,  during November of 2020,  I was about to run a 5k with my family,  and my right ankle locked up,  no worries,  I\u2019ll brace it. I couldn\u2019t run a mile it hurt so bad. I dropped out of the race,  which was something I never did.  I always finished what I started.  \nDuring the first few days of 2021,  I was in volleyball, at this point I was wrapping my ankle,  it was very hard to keep playing, but I had to.  Well, during one game where I couldn\u2019t play because of some rules with practices,  my ankle, every time I stood up would lock,  and I couldn\u2019t even walk out of the game. I crawled to my dads car where everyone thought I was just doing this for attention.  I went to the sports trainers and they told me to go to a local surgeon. Uh oh. That\u2019s not good. He told me to do physical therapy before we did an MRI because nothing showed up on the X-rays. \nI did that for 3 months. But they only worked on my hips, because they thought that, that was the issue. I was begging for an MRI because it had gotten to the point where moving it hurt.  They did it. Reluctantly. Lo and behold,  I had 18 millimeters of bone and cartilage chipped off in my ankle,  what from you\u2019re probably asking?  Tumbling. \nI got arthroscopic ankle surgery and I couldn\u2019t walk for 6 weeks. But my surgeon never put me in physical therapy.  I then kept telling them,  this hurts,  nothing is better,  what is going on here?  They then put me in physical therapy only after I demanded for it. It obviously didn\u2019t work either.  I got another MRI that September. Guess what.  The surgery didn\u2019t work at all,  and he told me that there was nothing he could do and told me to go to Loyola. \nWhen I got to Loyola. They told me that it was all in my head. That I should put aspercream on it and it was all because my nerves wanted to heal before my bone.  HUH.  I AM SORRY. WHAT?\nI believed him because I thought that we were supposed to trust doctors. \nIt stated to get a lot worse from there. I joined my schools dance team because I was told I could.  I got back into PE. \nThen it only got worse. Shocking. I was referred to a doctor,  and they never told me anything. They sat me down and told me to suck it up and that I was only doing this for attention. No sir. No I wasn\u2019t.  Was limping so bad that people thought I got shot. \nI went to my current doctor,  he is amazing. He did the right thing. He put 2 screws in my ankle and a 3D printed a custom titanium plug from my CT scan, made by Duke University. Perfectly fitted for me. I got the surgery 1 day after my 16th birthday.  I was in a cast for 3 months and on crutches for 3 1/2.  I am in physical therapy, and I am doing well,  and don\u2019t get me wrong. I have some soreness. But that\u2019s normal. \n\nWhy do I blame my 6 year old self you may be wondering? Well. If I would have never begged my mom for me to do gymnastics. I would have never been in this situation. I would have been the literal god of softball is I wouldn\u2019t have asked. I was hitting it out of the park at 7. The amount of college offers I would have by now if I would have stuck with softball. But, you can never go back in time. It\u2019s a part of life. And no one can ever change the past,  but you can always prepare for the future.",

    "postText": " So, I am 31 and just had someone close to me pass. On top of that, my little sister is in jail. I also have a boyfriend who is here...but doesn't seem to be here. Like, I am moving for California so that I can pursue my dream career, but I am not sure if he is actually going to come with me, or if I am going to find out some crazy because he is military. I am not doing well with holding all of this in and it is spilling out at work where I feel like I am getting on people's nerves. Even when I am joking and being happy I know it's because I am having trouble. \n\nI don't want to go to work like this. A lot of the time I am just talking and saying things to fill the air so I don't have to think about anything. I have to pay for school. I have to grieve properly. I have to keep going and I am just going through the process of grieving and having a hard time with it.  Thanks for reading.",

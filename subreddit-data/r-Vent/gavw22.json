I live in Brooklyn a community that has been hit so hard by this virus, nobody is going out to protest, nobody is calling this a joke here, and nobody is making this political. We are literally warning the country about a virus that can take there loved ones, and the response is that it\u2019s a hoax.",

I think that as long as some places are in business people won't understand the severity of the situation. As long as some people say it's okay , too many people will continue to act like they do. It's so depressing when you have tons of commercials saying \"we are in this together \" and it's clearly not how many present themselves.",

Yeah sorry I'm an essential worker who HAS to work because I don't qualify for unemployment, I still have to go to the store for groceries, and I still have to go get prescriptions (not all can be delivered). Meanwhile I live with my at risk grandparent. \n\nIt's so frustrating. It's not that difficult to wear a mask and stay indoors. These people have no idea how much harder it is to lose a loved one.

I\u2019m an essential worker too (grocery store) and I\u2019m so glad I haven\u2019t met anyone this bad so far.\n\nLike, I should stay home because grandpa Daryl doesn\u2019t like the fact that his mask fogs up his glasses or because middle-age Michelle doesn\u2019t think it looks nice? Screw that. I have to wear my mask for the duration of every shift (not to mention the medical workers who are probably sweating in hazmat suits with bruised ears from wearing masks for so long). I\u2019m sure they can handle wearing one for a quick grocery trip. It\u2019s ridiculous what some people are trying to find problems with. \n\nAnd if they want me to stay home while they get to continuing going to the grocery store, are they going to pay me? Will they do my job for me? Are they going to deliver my groceries and pick up my prescriptions? It\u2019s not as easy as \u201cjust staying home\u201d. Stores aren\u2019t open just because you\u2019re bored and need to get out of the house to buy a box of popsicles. They\u2019re called \u201cessential\u201d businesses for a reason: they\u2019re open so you can get what\u2019s essential. Making 20 trips to the store for every little thing you want is not why they\u2019re open and is the exact opposite of what you should be doing. I can\u2019t tell you how busy it\u2019s been at the store I work at ever since the lockdown stuff started. Days where customer traffic is usually less (weekdays, rainy days/bad weather), it\u2019s been packed. It\u2019s like people think they can race the virus if they\u2019re only in the store for five minutes or less.\n\nApologies for preaching to the choir, but ugh I hate every single person who thinks this whole thing is made up or blown out of proportion. I\u2019m also venting as someone who hasn\u2019t even lost a loved one to this virus yet I can still understand the severity of it all. People can be so awful.",

(she developed pneumonia).\n\nThe issue i, and the rest of my family, am having, is that despite her autopsy report stating she died from complications of Flu, her Death cert states otherwise, and she is listed as a Covid-19 death still.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sincerely doubt that this is some big conspiracy, however, the conflicting reports has resulted in her life insurance not being paid out, because of the simple fact, her Autopsy report, does not match what is on the Death Cert.\n\nHer parents are trying to sort it out, but the Coroner who did the report, is not the one who ultimately signed her Death Certificate (which is another issue)\n\nAfter asking around, my family is not the only family having this issue.",

I\u2019m starting to see people my age (high school) going out with friends less than six feet apart and even going out without a mask. I live in Michigan, where we have a stay at home order till May 15. School has been cancelled for the year as well. \n\nI personally am lucky enough not to have a family member that I know of be impacted by covid-19, but it\u2019s really annoying and heartbreaking to see people who don\u2019t give two shits about it. There\u2019s a guy I know who\u2019s going to the military this summer who says everyone should just get the virus and whoever dies, dies because \u201csocial distancing doesn\u2019t work\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve seen stories of people having the virus and it\u2019s pretty scary. Barely able to breathe, having to be attended to, and unable to see family in person. I\u2019m not very in tune with my emotions, but it\u2019s really sad to hear about those things. I just hope there will be a vaccine soon and have less deaths occur. Though the latter might not be as less as it could be since people don\u2019t want to try to help slow down the spread.",

I talked to them on site and called a supervisor. About two months ago. They all kinda weasled their way out of accounability. Saying they were making shelters. The homes they are building are two three year builds that they are a year into, no ones moving into them for a while. I pointed out they were a long way from carpets, or roofs And cause im venting, their multi million dollar homes, so no one who can afford those homes are going homeless.\n\nI voiced that my two brothers and Dads places of work all shut down and all three buisnesses figured out how to keep everyone paid and at home. And all three places, keeping some privacy, employ 50 to 1000 people. it aint impossible \n\nthe school system did it\n\nAhh. its shit.a lot of its shit\n\nI gave some reading to people on youtube who say covids a hoax. \n\nI have hated that the maturity level is low I guess.\n\nSorry, Im not great at words. \n\nDeath is sad",

            "comment": "Most of the people protesting are idiots but I still disagree with a lot of what the government has done with this. It\u2019s okay for me to go to Walmart and purchase a pair of pants but it would be illegal for Macy\u2019s to sell me a pair, it makes absolutely no sense. If I was an employee of a clothing store laid off right now I\u2019d be absolutely furious that my government screwed me over while continuing to allow other stores to sell the exact same products. We knew from the very beginning that most viruses spread through the air and enter the respiratory system yet it was advised against wearing face masks. Now months later it\u2019s advised that we wear face masks and that wearing said face mask greatly reduces the chance of catching or spreading the virus. The federal government needs to step up and mandate the use of face masks for everyone in the USA while in public. If face masks were required and not a \u201crecommendation\u201d from the very beginning then most likely this never would have gotten out of hand and 1 out of every 5 workers wouldn\u2019t be laid off right now.",

Macy\u2019s, last time I checked, does not sell food. Are you suggesting Walmart should just not sell anything that another store sells because they are closed?",

Clothing is just as essential as food for me and it\u2019s what is required to put food on my table. Try wearing a pair of Walmart boots on a job site and see just how many days they last. On average they last 3 weeks but I\u2019ve even had a pair fall apart in less than a week. In comparison my sears diehard boots which are over a year old are still on my feet, sure they are held together with superglue at this point and they stopped being waterproof months ago but they still get the job done. Clothing is absolutely essential and required for everyone of us who is an essential worker. Wake up and actually look at what\u2019s going on around you. I can\u2019t buy a decent fucking pair of work boots for my job but I can go to the liquor store and pick up a 40 and some scratch off tickets. Fuck why am I even considered essential anyway? Are people really going to die if they can\u2019t rent out $2,000-$6,000 apartments? It\u2019s great fuck over the small businesses and the malls that are already dying while doing absolutely nothing to stop the spread. If 1/5 of the us population filed for unemployment that means the other 4/5 of us are still working and I can tell you that most of us don\u2019t have jobs where we can work from home. You want to stop the spread the arrest the idiots still throwing parties, going to church, and walking around without masks on. Oh no we can\u2019t do that because this is America and people need freedom.",

    "postText": "I understand wanting someone to remember important events but these events are really last minute things we do all the time. I\u2019ve started writing everything down in my calendar, sometimes I miss writing down an event or two and they get really annoyed ( I don\u2019t miss the event, I just usually ask oh what\u2019s going on Saturday and that triggers them I guess cause I should already know). \n\nBut sometimes I have the event down and I remember and I reach to ask \u201chey what time are we doing this or how are we getting there\u201d and apparently we had a conversation about that too at some point and they get annoyed again. Am I really supposed to remember every single detail we talk about, especially if it\u2019s casual and in passing? Is it so wrong to ask again the day before about our plans and the details \ud83d\ude2d\n\nMy memory is apparently bad, I seriously can\u2019t help not recalling if we said we\u2019re gonna meet there or carpool and I don\u2019t understand why my partner can\u2019t be kind and just remind me? Especially if I take the lead in asking about it well before the actual event takes place.",

    "postText": "I don't understand how you can know someone obviously doesn't have the money as they gave the loan. Take the car back which is their right i guess and then auction it off and make me pay the difference. In any other debt agreement if they auction off the debt it usually means they just have to take the loss. Its predatory because the only people who get loans are people who can't afford to buy, take the car back fine but theyre gonna auction it off, throw my shit away, and then bill me for the rest. That is absolutely insane. Imagine if anything else did that. Im not paying for a car that I'm not going to use. I dont owe anyone anything if they took their shit back. Thats like going to a store on Christmas shopping payment plan and if you don't pick up your paid for items by the date they put it back on the shelf and ask you to finish payments and don't give you anything back. Thats utter nonsense. Take the car whatever I'll buy a new one, items are easily replaced. But you are taking the car because I can't make payments, I'm telling you I can't pay 4k in two weeks because Im poor why would you then bill me. the point is to make me pay for the car! I'll just wait to send it to collections and deny the transaction anyways so it just makes it all kinda silly! They still lose out on their money and I still don\u2019t get a car. So what is the whole point. Then lets not forget this multi million/billion dollar company is going to charge a 658$ tow fee. green earth, that bitch 658$. Local tow companies charge 150 plus 50 a day. They only jad it for 2 weeks so not only are they making me pay, the balance, late fees, a key fee(200$ btw like wtf), a reinstatement fee(300$), but also a tow fee amd you expect me to be able to pay that and get it back. I coulda done it in 2 weeks as before those dumb ass fees it was like 2k. Yea it woulda hurt but it was possible. Now im stuck like what am i supposed to do....\n\nAnd before some contrarian asshole says \"dont get things you cant afford\" I could afford it at the time numb nuts. I was making 1300/wk before my job just laid me off. They were hemorrhaging money at the warehouse I worked at and \"over hired\" for the season(just to help with work load but made it seem as if it was a perm position) and just let their new hires go for any bullshit reasons they could think so we couldn't/wouldn't reapply for the next 3 years. Shit happens in peoples lives and I had lived out of that car for a few months already. I had a few hard trials and tribulations with very few family members helping out where they can, and I finally just got a job that pays well but requires personal transportation or to sleep on a park bench Ig and hope no one takes my  shit(or my ass lol) while I hide the fact I don't have a car and is currently sleeping outside. \n\nDue to my current job they'd normally put me in a hotel if I lived 60+miles away or an hour+ but the new location they'll only reimburse me for travel expenses but I don't have anyone to take me there to pay for travel and uber is out of the equation since i just barely by the skin of my teeth got into my apartment and is now BROKE.",

                    "comment": "Actually thats not a good analogy and for something to be analogous it would have to be similar. My store analogy is more similar due to 3 factors. \n\n1) goods in a store are counted by how many hands have touched them throughout transport and storage and would produce similar wear and tear to a product over time.\n\n2) it doesn't matter if its a big deal or not because thats not the issue that im trying to draw attention to and rather quite the opposite. You say this as if I'm concerned with the item. I'm concerned with paying it back after they took it and still charging me to which my analogy did. In yours the item is mine and thus its wouldn't have been tooken back in the first place because the issue is non payment not a refunding issue.\n\n3) again the toilet paper is mine at this point, its not like they are taking said toilet paper and then auctioning it off at a discount but charge my card after someone else buys it for the difference. That is still ridiculous under your logic and thats not even the situation a more balanced analogy using your toilet paper would be if I made a payment plan for a pack of toilet paper, i pay off some of the toilet paper but I miss a couple payments and then they break into my house take the remaining toilet paper without my knowledge or consent, call me telling me they already sold it to someone at a discount so I have to pay for the difference even though they took the toilet paper.\n\n Its still a dick move in whatever context and I knew your elk would come soon. Is so contrary for the sake of  eing on the contrary and I don't think irony could explain what theat is.",

You used the item and devalued it. \n\nYour Christmas analogy had you not even picking up the item to use it. \n\nMine had you using it ruining it.\n\nYou buy something for $100. Fail to make any payments. They take it back and have to sell it for $75. You owe $25. What the issue here?\n\nI dont even want to bring in interest into this as I think it's too much at this point.",

                                    "comment": "You took a singular statement in a rant at face value without any other context and out of its original one, and expect it to make logical sense is exactly what I'd expect of a pseudocontrarian.\n\nNo, I don't because with any other retail item this is not the case, maybe with property but thats a WHOLE different ballgame (still a scam on that too but thats not the topic of discussion rn). By its mere existence, its devalued, not to mention its already been used and is older when I came into possession of the item. \n\n\nMy analogy wasn't a 1-to-1 representation. No analogy is, by definition. Yours had (person A) paying the full amount and trying to return the item. In yours also, it's a **return**  which the return was mutually agreed upon, and even then, any reasonable person or shop would cut their loss with the item and not provide a refund of payments if it was that serious of damage. They wouldn't go to your house, take said item back, put the item back on the clearance price at the same or similar price and charge you for the difference as if the item was brand new &lt;- which is the issue. I didn't seek a return, I didn't want to return the item. \n\n\nThirdly, even if you discount all of that and we go with your over simplistic question. The issue is the toilet paper was originally $200 (to keep consistency)  someone returned them with the plastic but missing a few rolls and some others has poop on it, so they lowered the price to $100. I pay $75 of it miss the last payment, they come into my bathroom while its still on the roll and take it back  and then sell it for $75+ and make me pay the $25 because I simply used it. The issue isn't that they took the item its me paying the difference. It would be much easier and in everyones best intrest for me to not have the item and still pay for it in hopes of it being returned or they cut their losses on an item that depreciates in value after every use, in transport, and by merely existing.\n\nSince you brought up interest, which is irrelevant since the interests only accounts for the time its in my possession and is the first thing you pay before the principal, it only leaves me with one question do you enjoy the leather or the rubber more? Maybe its the polish or the laces?",

That's not the only relevant part as it's irrelevant since ALL things depreciate in value irregardless of its usefulness (except for property, thus its exclusion). Your analogy didn't even focus on depreciation, nor was it a similar situation. So, self, admittedly, you failed on two fronts.\n\nI fully read all the contracts I've ever signed, even the 150+ pages of my enlistment contract. It wasn't mentioned that this situation was even possible and says the opposite in legalese and even by admittance of the salesman. Take your own advice. This is a place to RANT. Whether or not I was right or wrong is irrelevant. So is my willingness to get into the contract as that's not the issue ive presented. Now you failed on three fronts. I see now that you like the leather, the rubber, and even the grime on the bottom, too. Go be miserable some place else.",

    "postText": "Me (16 F) my friend (15F) and my bf (15M)\n\u2014\u2014-\nTo start off I\u2019ve known my friend longer than my BF by only a few months, and I started dating my BF a few months ago\n\nThey go to the same school while I go to a different high school. Did you spend a lot of time together to be fair? I also spend time with her. \n\nAt first, I was OK with it as it was understandable as well. All three of us were in a trio best time on he brings her up more and more even when we\u2019re just talking about us it makes me uncomfortable and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m just over reacting or just jealous. \n\nIt hurts me when I talk about my mental issues. He brings up how he always dealt with her mental issues. \n( it hurts me because I\u2019m not her and he\u2019s comparing my issues to her issues )\n\nWhatever I talked to him he at least brings her at four or five times \n\nLike I said, we are all close friends \nMy friend is actually dating my brother \n(15M)\n\nAnother thing that makes me believe I\u2019m just over reacting and being jealous is the fact that my other friend who also know my friend always talk about her and compare her to me,\n\n( I don\u2019t like that they compare me to her as we are two different people to different issues )\n\nThey have all made it clear that they do prefer her over me , as she is the prettier, one funnier, one and more energetics/fun\n\nI just don\u2019t like how he seems to always bring her up no matter the situation.\n\nI know I\u2019m just being jealous and over reacting.",

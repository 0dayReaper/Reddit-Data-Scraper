    "postText": "I understand some of the issues in this sub are far worse than what I\u2019m facing, but this has been weighing on me for about 2 years and I have nowhere else to go, so why not semi-anonymously on the internet? If you take the time to hear my groaning, thankyou truly. \nI had a long relationship (2+ years) end close to three years ago now. I broke it off because I felt we were growing apart and I was beginning college and didn\u2019t need the extra stress. She didn\u2019t take it well, but we broke on fairly good terms. We were both planning to attend the same college however, which later became an issue. Within the next month, she had a boyfriend (didn\u2019t bother me any). For the first 5 months or so, we actual continued to have somewhat civil conversations, until one day, I spotted her on a dating app I use. The first thing I did was check her socials to check if she was still with her boyfriend (she was). I naturally swiped left only to see the message \u201cyou missed a potential match\u201d. This account had liked mine. I immediately texted her giving her the benefit of the doubt \u201chey, I think somebodies pretending to be you on bumble\u201d. Her response? \u201cOh you swiped left on me?\ud83e\udd7a\u201d. I immediately called her (which she ignored), so I just blocked her. Not five minutes later, her BOYFRIEND TEXTS ME. He asks me to unblock HIS girlfriend because she needs CLOSURE. I couldn\u2019t make this up if I tried. But this is just the start. After I curved her attempt to cheat on her boyfriend with me, I start hearing from all my \u201cfriends\u201d that my ex is going around spreading heinous rumors about me to anyone that\u2019ll listen, including, but not limited to (he physically assaulted me, he sexually assaulted me, he\u2019s a pedophile) on and on and on. So I make an attempt to contact her and eventually I do, I had to know for sure she was saying these things herself. She all but confirmed she WAS in fact spreading false rumors because she was mad I wouldn\u2019t sleep with her. The result of these rumors? My \u201cbest friend\u201d believes I screwed around with his younger sister (minor) and blocked me without even so much as consulting me despite the only \u201cevidence\u201d being my ex said so, every one of my \u201cfriends\u201d also believes her stories and haven\u2019t spoken to me in over a year, I constantly get death threats from people in my hometown etc. She also likes to find out anyone I\u2019m talking to romantically so she can fill them in on her bs. Mentally and emotionally I\u2019m so fucked, I\u2019m living far from my hometown now, I had to drop out of college and get a job I hate just to survive, I have no friends, no SO, not much family. I\u2019ve contemplated ending it more than I\u2019d like to admit. I\u2019ve attempted to seek counsel, but given the absurdity of my story, not even my counselor believes me. Not a soul believes me and it\u2019s a more terrible loneliness than I could have ever imagined. Never before have I truly hated a person, but I\u2019m not sure what I would do if I ever saw her again. She ruined my life.",

    "postText": "So, these past few months have been pretty tough on me. I've been struggling to connect with people, and I feel like I'm losing my friends. I feel so alone right now, and this feeling started about a year ago. School's pretty hard on me, my family neglects me emotionally, I have a boyfriend but I don't feel like I can open up to him properly because I don't think he listens really well. This month, the feeling of being lonely hit me like a truck. I didn't have any friends to spend time with, I feel like I can't trust my two bestfriends, my other bestfriend ignored me for some reason, and I'm going into a downward spiral. My anger issues were getting worse: I keep getting violent thoughts about people whenever I'm annoyed, irritated, or frutrated; school adds fire to my anger issues, and it just keeps getting worse.\n\nBasically, everything's too much for me. I can't handle it anymore, and I just feel like everything's getting out of my control. Wherever I go, I'm always stressed. I can't handle it anymore. I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like giving up on everything, and I just feel like I'm cursed 'cause bad things keep happening to me. I tried seeking help for therapy, I used my lack of appetite as an excuse to my dad. He agreed, and we went to inquire about a session. We didn't come back. I also asked my dad if we could go to the doctor about my incontinence, my dad agreed but we also didn't go. I just feel so neglected right now. I don't know if I'm just a really big complainer or what. I just feel like giving up overall. I just want some friends to talk to. But really, I just wish for my life to be fixed. I just feel so alone, I wish I could find some friends who I can really connect with.",

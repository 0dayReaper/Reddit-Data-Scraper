It is not ok and will never be. You need to tell a trusted adult. If you are in school, tell your counselor, or teacher. If you trust your mom, tell her. Tell someone. Please. It isn't your fault that your father did any of that, and it never will be your fault. If you need to talk to someone, dm me or someone you trust. You have every right to want and need support because this is serious. I really hope something gets done about this, but I can only do so much on an app as a stranger. Please reach out to someone and tell them before anything escalates. Again, dm me if you want. I'll try to respond as soon as possible.",

    "postText": "My girlfriend left me in such a stupid way. I deserved it, I got back with her 3 times before this and I deserved to be let down for being so stupid, but she \"needs to work on her mental health\" and \"Can't be with someone while she does\" and it just made me so mad for a while. I felt anger, and that was easy to deal with, it's not my usual depression or anxiety. But now the anger faded and the depression is here. I was listening to the song Miserable at Best cause I still listen to music for teens, and it made me think about her being with someone else. The thought of it made me sick to my stomach. I shared so much with this woman, she accepted so much of me, we danced to the song I wanted to be my first dance at my wedding. Now I'll have to live with the fact that those memories, that loss will always be there. The worst part is I know she's not hurting like I am. I know she's better at managing things, I know she can handle herself. I lost AGAIN and all I have is this stupid bear that she got me. It says 'I love you' in her voice when I press on the hand. I so desperately want to push that button and listen to it",

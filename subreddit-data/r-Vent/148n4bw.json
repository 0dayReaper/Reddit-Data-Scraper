    "postText": "I am a 18 year old girl, and I'm tired of being a mom. \n\nI'm not actually a mom. I have a mentally disabled brother who I have gad to take care of since I was very young. \n\nI have always had to be the mature one, even if I am the youngest daughter. In ever situation, even with friends, I have to be the mature one. I have to be perfect and responsible always. \n\nI want to be taken care of so badly. It's probably why I seek older men, idk. I just hate constantly having to act like a grown woman, even when I wasn't. I was told to act like an adult when I was 12. I'd like for once to be taken care of, or at least appreciated.",

I lived the same experience, and still am expected to be wiser, more responsible, and more mature than I can be because that's what I've always done.\n\nI disappoint those people, now. I allow myself the grace to be my age, to be vulnerable, to be taken care of now. It's hard to know I'm letting people down (old habits, and all that), but reminding myself that it's their fault for pushing their own unfair expectations on me helps. Setting boundaries is a great way to reclaim yourself.\n\n\u201cThose who get angry when you set a boundary are the ones you need to set boundaries for.\u201d",

It took me a long time to realize that I wasn't appreciated because it was expected of me. They assumed I would always be there and they took advantage of me. I am still here when they need me but I no longer volunteer all the time. They have to learn to live without me. \n\nI am moving in the opposite direction soon. No more passing my house and vice versa on the way to town or being a few minutes away. Lol If they come to my town/ home and I theirs, it's been planned.  \n\nDon't spend your whole life living for others because you'll forget to live for yourself.",

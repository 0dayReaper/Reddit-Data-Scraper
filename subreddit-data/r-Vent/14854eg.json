    "postText": "Tomorrow is the final day of school and then summer. I am not at all exited because I have no one to talk to and I\u2019ve lost interest in all my hobbies and I have no plans all summer. But on the other hand I don\u2019t want to go to school because being around people talking to each other just reminds me how lonely I am. All I want to do is just do nothing. I\u2019ve been sick for a week and a half and it\u2019s gotten so bad I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll be able to fall asleep tonight.",

I work full time and the money is fine (I have more then most people my age imo but definitely not a millionaire) as I\u2019m not paying rent or bills but It\u2019s not a lifetime job for most people. \n\nI worried I should be doing more to prepare for the future such as savings for a place of my own or a pension. \n\nI am also not truly sure what I want from life.",

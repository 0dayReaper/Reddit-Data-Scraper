    "postText": "I (14F) have a crush (14M) that I would do anything for, but I'm about to move on to the next grade and he's moving schools, so I'll never see him again. He's super cute and sweet, but he makes fun of me. I don't know if that's a sign that he likes me back, or a sign that he despises me. I cry every night for him because I love him so much and don't ever want to lose him. I'm also too scared to shoot my shot because he has a big group of friends that are always around him and I'm afraid if I told him my feelings for him, his friends would make fun of me or something.",

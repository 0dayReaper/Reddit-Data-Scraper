    "postText": "Hi umm my name is grace. I am a senior in highschool and I am super worried abt my college admission and shit. I already to the Sat twice and I got a 1280 and a 1150. Although some people might think that\u2019s a good score it\u2019s not for me because I am a fucking immigrant and I need scholarships. I am planning on taking the august Sat and I have no motivation to study for it . My mom keeps telling me to but it\u2019s just hard to focus. Then I have common app essays to write  abt and I don\u2019t know what to talk abt I have sat down for hrs on end thinking abt what to write how to write it but I don\u2019t know how to do it. The more I think abt my essays an what to write the more I feel like I have no personality and I am just a fucking robot that is meant to do everything right which I am not even good at. I don\u2019t want to talk about my dads death for college because it feels that I am gonna trauma dump and my sister is gonna read my essay before I turn it in. And I hate expressing myself[ tbh I don\u2019t know how to express my emotions ]and my mom compares me to my sister because she only came a few months from another country  and she was able to get a full ride to some schools. I just wannna cry to somone on voice call and I want them to say it\u2019s gonna be okay because it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now",

            "comment": "Doesn't being an immigrant actually help with getting grants and scholarships and stuff? I know a kid that got a full ride even though his grades weren't that great because of some immigrant college grant program. \n\nBut even if you don't make it into a good school right away It's not the end of the world. Could always get your 2-year degree from a community college and then transfer credits to a real university after. Save a lot of money that way and it doesn't make your degree any less real or practical.\n\nAlso I know that writing about your father's passing is probably hard and not fun, but those white old men and ladies in college admissions boards eat that shit up. Like seriously you'll get Karen crying and begging to get you in to her school.",

    "postText": "I'm not sure if this needs a TW, it probably doesn't, but I will add one. \nI have chronic pain and I'm living off of food stamps. \nI keep seeing people saying that eating healthy in America is easy and that you have no excuse, even if you are poor. \nI feel like the people who say that are either 1.Not American and just don't realize how bad our food is. 2. Know how bad it is but they don't care, they're just bsing as an excuse to hate fat Americans. 3. Wealthy enough to not understand the correlation between being poor and eating unhealthy. Or 4. They're American, and they eat an unhealthy diet but they don't realize it. They think they're healthy, but they're not. \n\nI really try to eat healthy but I feel like every grocery shopping trip is just another ordeal where I freak out because they raised the price of something healthy. When you're struggling to afford groceries and see that oatmeal has gotten more expensive, but then notice that the INSTANT oatmeal that is 99% sugar is much cheaper, you might make the unhealthy choice. \n\nAll the \"fruit juice\" is just sugar water with barely any nutritional value, but it's way cheaper than fruit. The whole wheat bread is more expensive than the sugary white bread. \n\nI think people assume that every unhealthy person is just eating donuts and pizza everyday. Well, some are lol. That stereotype exists for a reason.\nBut others are just making choices that are ALMOST healthy, except that all the inexpensive food is full of additives like salt, sugar, and corn syrup. Even our honey is mostly corn syrup. \nNo wonder so many of the  skinny people here are fasting constantly. It feels different to eat three meals a day without having too many calories. \n\nAnyway if you're gonna tell me I'm wrong and that eating healthy is sooo easy, at least explain how. I actually want advice.",

If you want to cook a meal with solely whole healthy foods, you\u2019d be paying more than you would buying high-protein tv dinners etc. There are obviously hacks you could try to get maximum groceries on a budget, but the point of my post is that majority of ingredients you buy are processed and unhealthy for your body unless buying raw veggies, meats, grass fed cow milk etc which seems impossible affordability wise and location wise. I\u2019m no expert, I just know our food system is f*cked. I\u2019m just now teaching myself these things because my gut has suffered from lack of knowledge of what I was putting into my body every day.

I cook for 2 adults and 2 children and need leftovers for lunches the next day. Fruits are definitely on the pricier side but still cheaper than buying snacks, specially if you stick to the cheaper fruits like bananas. \n\nJuice is cheaper than fruits but it doesn\u2019t fill you up so it\u2019ll be expensive to use juice as a replacement for whole fruits. \n\nBeans, lentils and rice are pretty cheap and easy to make at home. Beans and lentils are high in protein and so can replace meats which are super pricey now. Brown rice is pricier than white rice but you can skip the bread and get the brown rice instead. \n\nAlso a lot of people waste a lot of parts of fruits and veggies that are completely edible such as the leaves in strawberries, and orange peels, just gotta wash it well to get rid off the pesticides.\n\nPersonally I\u2019m one of those that think healthy eating is cheaper if you\u2019re willing to try new dishes and get creative with recipes.\n\nETA: fixed for clarity",

After looking at the actual document, I looked it up again online. If you Google it, you can find this excerpt from the 13th Amendment at the top of the first page.\n\n The 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that: \n\n__Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.__\n\nRead up on Jim Crow laws.\n\nWe have more over crowded prisons and more prisoners than any other country in the world. \n\nMost of our prisoners have committed non violent offensives, such as being caught smoking marijuana. I know a man that spent 2 years in prison for unpaid parking tickets. Is that enough to go to prison for? Keep in mind that almost all of our prisoners are poor and can\u2019t afford a decent lawyer.\n\nPrisoners are disenfranchised citizens of the United States. The constitution no longer applies to them. Off the top of my head for example, they have no right second amendment, no forth amendment. All of this forever. Again, you will never be able to vote, carry a gun, or have any right to privacy. There\u2019s are more extensive list if you\u2019re interested.\n\nPrisoners lose their rights as American citizens. I probably can\u2019t say that enough. One of those rights being the right to a minimum wage.\n\nOf course they will be paid minimum wage once they\u2019re out, if they can get a job.\n\n__As disenfranchised citizens of the United States. As people losing their rights as American citizens once convicted of any crime. That\u2019s why prisoners make $0.33 to $1.41 on average. Texas, Georgia, Arkansas, and Alabama, don\u2019t pay prisoners for their labor at all. That\u2019s why unscrupulous companies cash in on prison labor. Everyone from Walmart to Fidelity Financial!__\n\nThere\u2019s an excellent, historically extensive documentary called *The 13th* If you have the time, check it out. \n\nIf this post is in any way unclear, let me know and I\u2019ll fix it right away.",

U need to be at walmart, not targetC not HEB, not whole foods. Except go to HEB for tuna packets (under 100 cals for like $1.18, for some reason Walmart charges more).\n\nMicrowavable veggies last forever and are easy and kinda cheap. No salt added canned vegetables like corn and beans are under $1. Go to sams club or costco for bulk chicken and eat a shitton of shrimp. Cut out red meat, its expensive and not rlly actually healthy unless ur getting super lean meat which is expensive. Unless u eat salad very quickly, I\u2019d say dont buy salad stuff. It\u2019s a scam and it doesnt actually fill u up. Buy bell peppers in bulk and freeze them to cook later. \n\nA lot of what ppl tell u is healthy is too expensive. But u can still eat relatively healthy in america if ur not blinded by the organic propaganda. Also if u look at the cals on what ur ordering at a fast food place, u can still eat relatively cheap. It\u2019s all about choices",

Basically the dirty ones you want organic but the clean ones you can buy conventional which is way cheaper. \n\nWhen I was suuuuper broke I was lucky I worked at Whole Foods (pre Amazon) and they had a 20% discount even for part-timers plus my store manager let people take home spoilage - bruised fruit, day old bread, etc. maybe look into working at a grocery store if it\u2019s not a pay cut. It\u2019s hella convenient!\n\nMy friend in the same situation made due by prepping a week\u2019s worth of burritos every Sunday. Wheat tortilla, canned beans, shredded cheese, canned corn, leftover chicken or whatever. Cheap, high protein, portable, easy to nuke at work or school. \n\nSending you prosperity and wellness vibes!",

My husband has been having some mystery health issues for most of this year and he\u2019s been trying all kinds of lifestyle changes trying to get better. We now believe a lot of it is down to our shitty American diet of processed food and added sugar. Basically over the past 6 months we started eating whole foods and avoiding processed food altogether. No sweet drinks, just water and coffee with milk. We read the ingredients on everything we consume now and have been learning how to decipher the intentionally-confusing nutrition facts. Changing our diet has helped both of us lose weight and get healthier.\n\nIt\u2019s mind-boggling how much processed crap is in our food. There\u2019s dozens of different names for \u201csugar\u201d and other ingredients so it can be almost impossible for the layperson to know what exactly they\u2019re eating.\n\nAnd it\u2019s absolutely more expensive and time consuming to eat unprocessed food. It\u2019s way more work to eat healthy. But in the end you\u2019ll be rewarded with better health and even a longer life.\n\nThe food industry is killing all of us slowly. No hyperbole.",

Buy in season and shop farmers markets and hit the food pantries. Lean chicken and fish and vegetables can get dull but what can I say, it's a trade off. Stir fry veggies, season to taste and add some rice, very filling. Use Jasmine or brown rice as they're more flavorful. I buy that expensive loaf of whole grain bread but NEVER throw any away. I live alone so I divide that loaf into freezer bags of 4 slices each. I even reuse the freezer bags after washing them. Check out Youtube and social media for tips...tons of people posting ideas. But yeah, I sympathize because it is tough.",

                    "comment": "Yea using lentils is extremely cheap. Not to mention a big bag of dried beans/chickpeas can last you a month for like 10-15 dollars. Rice and beans/lentils with some frozen veggies and fried up with an egg or a can of tuna. Or lentil veggie stew of which there are a million variations, and you can add good stuff like spinach and potatoes to that. \n\nThose two meals are as healthy as can be, very low calories, high in fiber and protein and vitamins. And really if you average it out, and especially shop smart on those items, its gonna be around 1-2$ a serving. And even in a food desert most of that stuff you can buy over a months supply and it'll stay good for a long time. Thats what gets me about saying its expensive to eat healthy, I mean it takes some knowledge and preparation but I think except for people in some very extreme circumstances its almost guaranteed to be cheaper to eat healthy if you stay away from organic and gimmicky health stuff. \n\nFor example, where I live you can get 20lbs of potatoes for 10 bucks, that will last a month.\n\nLarge bag of carrots a few bucks. \n\nLarge bag of onions a few bucks. \n\nLarge bag of dried legumes 12 bucks or so\n\nLarge bag of rice maybe 20 bucks\n\nEggs are getting more pricey but still average around 30 cents and egg\n\nTuna usually 1.25 if you find a deal\n\nFrozen veggies can get a huge bag for 5 bucks\n\nJust the list above can be the basis of your monthly foods. If majority of your meals are based around that I mean its probably 100 dollars depending on the eggs, tuna, frozen veggies mostly. You could blow that eating fast food for just a few days. I had a 200 dollar food budget for a while and I didnt have everything I wanted but I ate pretty well and quite healthy. Even getting a rotisserie chicken once a week is just 12 dollars and then you can use the dripping and boil the bones to make a soup stock for the lentil stew, dont even need to buy broth. One chicken a week can be used in 4 meals or so if you take the meat for the stir fry or sandwiches or stews, thats still under 50 a month too.\n\nJust gotta learn the recipes, and if you gain skills making simple recipes taste good. Fresh garlic and ginger are extremely cheap but go a long way. Bananas are also really cheap at least where I live, peanut butter is actually good for you and cheap. The list goes on and of course if you have large grocery stores available you'll have more options. But even if you don't, just stock up on all that stuff once a month and you'll be mostly covered with a very healthy diet. Like probably healthier than 90% of people are eating these days, for way cheaper",

            "comment": "Here are some tips from me:\n\n1.  Plan your meals ahead of time.  You can get a list of what you need, go on the app for the store you use and do a price check.\n\n2.  Based on your list, you can make some substitutions for cheaper items.  For example, if you are going to bake something, swap out the oil for apple sauce (I buy the cinnamon one because it gives a better flavor to the cake).  I have since removed all high carbs out of my diet, so I replace them with zucchini and squash (you can freeze for later use - same goes for most fresh vegetables).  \n\n3. Eliminate red meat.  Ground turkey is better IMO and costs way less than lean beef.  I also buy whole chickens.  This gives so much meat for leftovers, plus you can use the bones to make your own broth.  If possible for you, buy meat in bulk and then separate into smaller portions at home before freezing.  This eliminates waste.\n\n4.  For snacks, I replaced chips with pork rinds and they are soooo much cheaper than a bag of chips.  \n\n5.  Don't buy soda or fruit juices.  I drink water and a cup of coffee every day.  I get my vitamins from a powder super green that I use in my protein shake (I use premier vanilla protein powder with the green powder, and it's about $30 for both products, but lasts me months before I need more).\n\nI know I'm missing other stuff, but if you any questions for me, please ask!",

This is what my grandma cooked, even after they became well off:\n\nGrandma made tortillas from scratch in large quantities and she would freeze them. She didn't buy premade tortillas. She bought a large bag of uncooked dry beans, and she would make a very large batch once a week. As for cheese, she would buy the extra large block, cut it up, and freeze some. \n\nThese was usually what she purchased at the grocery store, and if any were on sale, she would stock up:\nMilk, eggs, rice, bags of dry beans, the large bricks of cheese, chorizo, potatoes, corn flakes, corn tortillas for enchiladas, bananas, whatever beef was on sale (if it wasn't on sale, you weren't having meat that week), and doughnuts from the clearance section. Folgers instant coffee. \n\nBreakfast: Eggs and chorizo, and sometimes pan fried potatoes. The cornflakes were there for grandkids. Bananas were available. \n\nLunch and dinner was always the same few recipes: bean and cheese burritos, cheese enchiladas, or she would cut the potatoes and meat into very small squares and she would boil them. She added spices to all this but I can't remember what. I know she always used bay leaves, and she made homemade enchilada sauce. Very simple but she mastered how to cook these so that they were so flavorful you never got sick of eating them. If you didn't want any of this, you got eggs.\n\nDessert was a doughnut. Sometimes she would make a dessert rice with cinnamon. I know she steamed peas and corn but rarely offered that, as that was usually for her. The only time they had more fruit in their diet was when my grandpa was growing strawberries and watermelon. They also used to have chickens and goats for goat milk. This diet must have been good enough because grandpa is 91 years old and going strong. It's a very simple and boring diet, but it's cheap. Hope this helps.\n\nBTW, bread in the US is not healthy. It's full of sugar. Oats are questionable. I've read some sources that say they are unhealthy.",

Protein powder is expensive up front but can dang near replace a whole meal. \n\nTea is cheap healthy and replaces soda and a pretty much forever shelf life.\n\nThe trick is to just find a stable consist meal plan that you can also buy in massive bulk with a long shelf life or can freeze.

I can't eat gluten, so pretty much anything with wheat in it.  This eliminated an unimaginable amount of foods you wouldn't expect from the grocery for me.  I cook almost every single thing we eat.  I rarely buy products advertised purely because it's insane to pay $8 for a pack of gluten free noodles that I know I'll need to buy two of for my family to eat.  I end up saving a little bit of money every month until I can afford to buy bulk meat at the butcher.  A side of beef breaks down to $2.65 lb here that way.  I scour food stalls (some do take food stamps) during harvest season and I freeze the produce or can it.  I make most of my own juices, preserves, and sauces this way.  I spent roughly $100 for an entire years worth of tomato products. (Juice, diced, sauce, paste, and turned the skins into a tomato powder for seasoning.)\n\nThe best advice I can think of is to save up for a deep freezer and canning set.  You'll also need a vacuum Sealer which you can usually find very cheap during black Friday sales.  If you're looking for cheap canning supplies, sometimes you can find them in rural estate sales for cheap.  I have likewise struggled with on and off again pain issues.  It's helpful to make extra large batches of food and freeze it.  I'll make double if casseroles like enchiladas or lasagna type things, throw one in the freezer before cooking so I have an easy night later.  I also do this with soups and stews fairly frequently because they thaw out well.  Another thing I've started doing is seasoning meat before I freeze it.  If I do buy from the store, I almost always get \"manager's special\" items.  I hope any of this is helpful or useful.  I'm likewise on a fixed income and it's difficult.  Good luck and I hope your day gets better.",

Plain water.  \nSure oatmeals are expensive, but you dont need them, theres gotta be a cheaper choice to eat for breakfast. a simple 2 half boiled eggs and 2 toast will get you through until lunch.  \n\n\nsounds to me you are trying to cope. no one is telling you to get oatmeal, no one is telling you to drink juice everyday. not saying you consume those everyday but im just countering your point on these 2 .\n\nI'm from the Southeast Asia so I might not know anything, but im giving you my point of view on how to make it work. In my country, Oatmeal is considered a somewhat luxury(?) and everyone makes do without them, not even juice.",

            "comment": "  It sounds like convenience has been your Achilles heel at the store. I guess your main complaint is that you want something that takes minimal effort, fills you with healthy calories, and is cheap. The trouble is that conveniently pre-made things like pizzas, chicken nuggets, \"instant\" anything, microwave dinners, etc are a lot of what's draining your wallet and packing on pounds (or just making you sick, as cheap pizza always does to me). How about a carrot? An apple or banana? A glass of whole milk? In the summer, I like to snack on frozen blueberries, or add them to my water instead of ice cubes. You don't need anything that has sugars or sweeteners in the ingredients. You don't need anything at all from the snack aisle. The less processed, the better.  \n\n  Fresh produce is great, but I save a lot of money by getting canned or frozen items. I like to buy frozen things in bulk (well, \"bulk-ish\" because I don't have a Costco or Sam's Club membership) Chicken breasts, assorted chopped veggies, berries, etc - I'm getting all of that in the frozen aisle at Safeway. This stuff is healthy enough because it isn't processed/fried/sweetened/sauced, it's just the most basic form. An entire chicken breast or two is pretty filling, and I've had a lot of nights where that is the entirety of my dinner. I often saut\u00e9 it in a pan with some adobo seasoning sprinkled on top and just eat it that way (and if I'm in a hurry, I don't even put it on a plate - I just stab it with a fork and eat it like a drumstick while standing over the pan).   \n\n  Also make sure to look down in the corner of the price label where they list price per oz to see if maybe the cheapo brand saves you some cash. Conveniently, the large bags of shredded cheese are the same cost ($0.25/oz) as the cheapest large blocks of cheese, so that works well for me. \n\n  But yeah, a big bag of frozen chicken breasts is golden! Cheap, lasts a long time, and you can turn it into just about anything by spicing it differently and pairing it with other things. Cook cubed chicken in a pan with a jar of Tika Masala sauce and some frozen assorted veggies: it all ends up tasting like the sauce anyway. Cook up some brown rice to mix with it, and that's three or four days of dinner (I put the leftovers into gallon sized zip lock bags or tupperware or whatever and just reheat the next day or next week.   \n\n  I've also done well cooking shredded chicken in taco seasoning and then adding part of a can of diced tomatoes/onions to the pan. You can enjoy without the shell if you want to cut carbs and save even more money. Or cube the chicken breasts and fry up with frozen assorted veggies and some soy sauce for a stir fry dinner.   \n\n  The big takeaway is to watch the prices of different items and brands so you make wise choices. And don't buy things that other people made unless you really understand what those ingredients are. The only pre-made meals that I get are canned soups. Even then, I tend to buy the cheapest, most boring kinds (the fewer ingredients the better) because I can add my own spices and other things if I want to. I don't have to wonder what those preservatives and additives are doing to my thyroid or whatever.   \n\n  Hope this helps someone!",

            "comment": "Idk, as a fellow poor American it seems like all you've mentioned is packaged, processed food. Comparing fruit juice to fruit is a red flag.\n\nWhen you're down to the nitty gritty like that it's less about buying the healthier option as it relates to white over wheat bread, and more about incorporating as little processed food as possible. Buy a family tray of the cheapest chicken, buy a big ass bag of rice, and bags of whatever frozen veggies you like. You'll eat for a week on about $25.\n\nThis is assuming you don't live in rural Alaska or something where you don't have any options. If that's the case then you are just screwed.",

            "comment": "You can fix this in a couple ways. First of all you don't really need bread. Sure whole wheat has nutrients but I end up not even eating the whole loaf. What a waste. You usually just put processed meat and cheese on there anyway. You could buy half a loaf do subway style with tuna salad, peppers, spanich, any and all vegetables and snack on that as well. That might be $10 in produce. I have guniea pigs as well so no produce goes to waste. That could be a meal for your whole week depending on loaf size. Pick a fruit and commit. I just bought a thing of blueberries this week. Has anxiotandant properties in it. Just do your research on fruit. Or buy the mixed fruit that the store provides. Should be $5 at kroger. Buy a small veg tray with dip should be 3.99 or so. Skip chips, cookies, soda. Maybe get an 8 pk of sparkling water if you need flavor. A couple Lean cusine power bowls. These are a bit pricey. $3 or $4 I believe. But there's kale in them cauliflower, peppers, grains. All kinds of stuff you need. A frozen pizza of course(my preference) tombstone deluxe is like $5.  A couple smoothies mixes. They make small bag size ones at Walmart 2 something each. A couple cans of soup. Skip the milk. Some yogurt with fruit mixed in.Bag of fish fillets. Couple cans of vegatables. Beef Jerky for snakcking. Flavored nuts for snacking.Any household items. Any pet items. This all should be $100 or less. My advice to you is to limit the snacking or stop or altogether, say no to obvious unhealthy choices, and teach your body to eat only a few times a day. Go with store brand choices. Don't make meat an necessity. Buy it every once in a while. Too much red meat is bad for you anyway. Focus on fruit, vegetables, fish. Anything high in protein that will fill you up. Also if you can, try to drive an older car that's already paided off if it's in drivable condition. Not so much about style these days. Spend that on clothes. I have an 03 Pontiac Grand Am and it's been running for 20 years. I got it last May. I take care of it and it runs great. Only has 125 miles on it. Just browse around at your local dealer. Sell newer car if you can. Get no contract phone cards from Walmart. Seem to be a Hella lot cheaper than what I used to pay at Verizon. Just play it smart.",

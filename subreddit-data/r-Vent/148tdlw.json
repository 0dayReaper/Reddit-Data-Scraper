I've always kind of hear them arguing since my walls are thin, but today I heard something that I can't shake. I heard them arguing as normal, but this time I heard my mom saying that 'she's trying since she doesn't want a loveless marriage'. I heard more that I don't really want to say. My mom was crying (I think). Should I ask my mom about it? I don't want to ask my dad. Help please.",

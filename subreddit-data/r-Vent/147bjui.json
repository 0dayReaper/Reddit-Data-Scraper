    "postText": "*IMPORTANT NOTE* I am not asking for advice, I just feel like a bad daughter. \n\n\nFor context: my mom and dad were never married and broke up a little after I was born. They get along pretty well but disagree on a few of things. After my mom, my dad dated my sisters mom. And most recently, he had this girlfriend (we will call her K)  that I rlly liked and he rlly liked that broke up with him a month or so ago. We dk why she did. \n\nMy dad is a very amazing person and is (most of the time) super nice. But some things he does makes me hate him. For one, he has recently been venting to me about how much he misses his ex gf, K, and I miss her too but I have my own shit going on and he's dumping this all on me. Two, he always talks shit about my mom right in front of me and it rlly gets on my nerves. Three, he always seems like he likes my sister more than me and I think one of the reasons is that she is skinnier that me. Four, he never rlly shows and interest in any of my hobbies, which upsets me because I want him too care about what I do. Five, he makes me feel pressured into getting perfect grades. As in, if I get an A-, that makes me feel so disappointed in myself. \n\nBut he's not a horrible person. And I always hate him for the things stated above for a few weeks then I remember that he will not be alive forevere an I feel so guilty about not hanging out w him more. But sometimes it hard to hang out w him cus he works A LOT. I just feel like a horrible daughter for hating him and then loving him then hating him over and over and over. Am I a bad daughter?",

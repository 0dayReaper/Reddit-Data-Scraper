    "postText": "I was looking forward to this weekend. My SO and I were supposed to go to an (EXTREMELY CASUAL) wedding but we backed out, opting to have a private visit with the bride and groom in a coming weekend because neither of us really like weddings. Bride and groom were fine with this cuz they're amazing badasses.\n\nSo to fill our weekend, we made vague plans to visit our friend who we haven't seen in a few weeks as well as going to my mother's place. My mom said she was free all weekend, so I was mostly planning around our friend's schedule.\n\nI sent her texts throughout the week, updating her on the wedding situation (my bf was hesitant and felt bad for backing out, which I understand but still pushed him to do it sooner than later cuz later is rude), but by Thursday she kind of wasn't responding to any message I sent about hanging out. Memes I sent? All got responses and reactions and lols. But hangout info was left on read.\n\nYesterday morning I sent her a message saying that I had a few chores and errands to run, but we'd be free by the evening! She didn't even look at the message. All day. Only got a response this morning saying \"Sorry, I forgot about evening plans with [other couple]\"... So you couldn't have messaged me to tell me that? You couldn't have actually let me know? All I could really muster was an \"lol ah\" because I don't really know what to say to that...\n\nI've never had an issue like THIS with our friendship, so it definitely caught me off guard. But also, not the first time she's been what I consider to be an unreasonable level of inconsiderate... Definitely miffed about it.\n\nAND THEN MY MOTHER.\n\nI meant to text her Friday but forgot because I suck apparently, but figured it'd be okay cuz she has all weekend free and hasn't told me otherwise, right? So I just texted her Saturday morning (after being left unread by my friend) and told her we're free all day Sunday. Her response, \"no time today?\"\n\nApparently she DIDN'T have a completely free weekend like she thought, but didn't text to tell me of that change. We're going over for lunch shortly, but I'm so damn irritated. This ALWAYS happens. I'm at the bottom of her totem pole of priorities, which is so damn hurtful when I consider the people that she prioritizes before me. She'll skip hanging out with me to hang out with my cousins ffs.\n\nShe respects that I don't speak to most family and the reasons why, but I don't think she realizes that she and my brother (who live in the same apartment) are the only two family members I still talk to. So when she chooses to hang out with [one of my literally 50 cousins] over me when she hasn't seen me in weeks, it stings. A lot.\n\nContemplating going a light low-contact with her over that... Still mulling the idea over, but I'm just getting really tired of being hurt like that. It's exhausting. So maybe instead of trying for once a week, I'll \"be busy\" 3/4 weekends every month. Just take some fresh air for myself.\n\nOkay, rant over. Thanks for reading if you went all the way through. And thanks for existing so I could get this off my chest \u2665\ufe0f",

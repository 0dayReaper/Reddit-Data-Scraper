    "postText": "Hello! Well, topic sounds likely a bit weird - what I mean is sometimes I think that it will be cool to have grandkids to thell them stories from my life.\n\nI'm in mid 30s now, don't even have kids or gf yet so those thoughts are hardly a plan :-)\n\nWhile my life didn't have anything cool enough to be, for example, mentioned in wikipedia, still I already had plenty of crazy adventures (like drinking vodka with local mobster and his gang on abandoned construction site in the middle of nowhere during winter night; tresspassed in museum closed for reconstruction in Rome; learned to fence with shield and sword from one of the best Europe's trainer after 30 years old, while not being sporty at all - various stuff), met interesting people (like, once was on a private diner with korean multimillionaire; once sat in theater next to opposition party's leader and had a brief chat; called to illegal cell phone in prison to now famous mma fighter to support him and so on), traveled quite a bit (from Niagara to Syrian border)... It's a bit sad that likely this all stuff will just perish into nowhere.\n\nI was adviced to write a book about it but tbh I doubt that a book about random somebody will be interesting to anybody.",

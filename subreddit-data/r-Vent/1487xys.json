    "postText": "I started my job in late February and was given 4 days of training before being asked to work by myself behind my desk. I don\u2019t have another receptionist on hand, our office has two locations. The location I\u2019m at has had the patient load grow exponentially. We have one doctor per day at each location. We\u2019ve started seeing &gt;35 pts a day. I\u2019m extremely overwhelmed and so is my coworker as well as my bosses. My boss nitpicks everything I do and will even make me change appointment times because the schedule isn\u2019t nearly perfect. My mental health has tanked and I nearly got 5150d last week. I\u2019m going to start therapy and will have to go once a week for the foreseeable future. I let my boss know and ofc it\u2019s \u201cwell idk if that\u2019s going to work for us\u201d because the only time I could get in is during work hours. Btw this is not on a day they see pts. We see people for testing 2x a month and even then it\u2019s maybe 8 people a day. I\u2019ve also brought up multiple times about putting blocks on our schedule for emergencies and my boss won\u2019t allow it. He thinks he doesn\u2019t see enough people for that to be necessary.",

So today she got off of work and she was on her way home there was an accident and she decided instead of driving around the accident she wanted turn around cool no problem. She then proceeds to ask me to direct her home using my goggle maps app, damn near impossible considering most of the way home is rural but I\u2019ll try, she then starts freaking out and getting angry with me saying I\u2019m not helping and that I don\u2019t care. Like how are you gonna start a fight not 10 minutes after leaving work if you\u2019re tired and angry from work cool don\u2019t call me and take it out on me take your ride home and cool off.",

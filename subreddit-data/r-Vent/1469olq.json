            "comment": "While humans tend to mess up a lot and walk towards their own demise as long as history remembers - I believe we are not going to be taken over by AI. This will be a process, but eventually these matters will become heavily regulated, to ensure less human suffering.\nThere still are a lot of professions that are unable to be taken by a machine or an alghorhytm, that humans just do better due to the so called \"human touch\". While it seems some things are being \"taken over\", for example jobs, let me point out something:\nIn a lot of factories and storage units there is a widespread use of machinery, that manipulates products and other objects. While it is true it took a job from humans who were doing it instead, it also keeps humans now from any further harm, that such job would've caused. (Such harm could be fatal, but now the risk is minimal) It also created a new job, that humans now take care of: monitoring and repairing these machines to ensure they work properly. Some of them are meant to be operated by someone, not by an AI also.\nThere will always be a human needed for such things, otherwise one error will cause another, and without a \"human touch\" there will be bigger disarray and problems.\n\nI don't know if someone's opinion can reassure you, but let's just try to be less pessimistic. Human spirit won't be crushed by souless machines, that are just made to serve us and nothing more.",

            "comment": "\"boring, bland minimalistic future\"\n\nWell if it's boring and bland that implies AI sucks at it. \n\nIf it's not boring and bland and it's awesome then I'd want AI to be doing it better rather than 10000 wannabe crappy artists/musicians for every 1 talented one. Hopefully these starving (TERRIBLE) artists will figure it out before they go down a path of mediocrity and choose something else that they can do better. \n\nPeople were complaining for years how their jobs like food service industry (and w/e else etc.) are boring, soulless and unfullfilling. Now AI is threatening to replace these jobs and now all of a sudden people are wanting to cling onto them. What a joke.",

Imagine art, music and other forms of CREATIVE freedoms without any single thought, only good imitations, with no real idea behind them, nor philosophy, only variables that were taken away from countless dead and alive artists who unknowingly (and without pay, notice or CONSENT) fueled and fed these programmes databases.\nThis is just cheap, glorified theft. A violation so fresh, there are no proper regulations yet. And just because there is an argument to be made about the AI creating \"something new\" from countless data, it's not new. It's still stolen and it's variables mashed together without thought and with no creative process. This data mashed together has nothing new, nor fresh.\n\nAlso any argument about the difference between a human being inspired and creating from inspiration and this - taking pieces of other's arts and gluing them together is not inspiration. It's taking a certain variables and twisting them yourself, with your own creative input. Your own narrative that stems from just your own creative process, just in some way guided by a thing that inspired you.\n\nExample: if you are being inspired by a leaf, you don't paint the leaf as you see it with all it's colors and veins being there. That's copying what you see, and while it is still creative work, it is not an inspiration, but observation and study. If you're being inspired, you take what inspired you and twist it, manipulate it to your own narrative and by your own idea make it your own. (Drawing simmilar looking leaf in different color doesn't count, like bruh).\n\nJust big walking yikes, that should be heavily regulated outside of private use.",

Much like I'd rather have a vending machine than a person sitting in a cart all day selling drinks. The big walking yikes is wanting regulation on the vending machine or banning the tractor trailer cause it can till 100x faster than a day laborers.",

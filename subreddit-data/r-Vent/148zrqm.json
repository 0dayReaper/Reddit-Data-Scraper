    "postText": "My wife and I were heading to the checkout line, it was us and a lady who got in line just before us (so she was in front of us).. a few seconds later her kids follow her with a LOADED cart. Yeah, not sure why she\u2019s having her child push it and not her self, the little girl pushing the cart could barley see over it. The issue that I\u2019m venting about is I just didn\u2019t like how she rushed in line just to \u201csave a spot\u201d. Line wasn\u2019t even that big, it was literally just someone in front of her, her, us, and a guy behind us. \n\nNow, I\u2019m known to call people out in public (in situations that effect me), so when my wife seen me notice this and about to say something she nudged me saying, \u201cdon\u2019t, it\u2019s fine\u201d.\n\nNow, that was that, but I\u2019m super petty and keep thinking back like \u201cman, I should\u2019ve said something\u201d. The reason why, is because like come on, get in line when you\u2019re ready and with your items, not jump in while your kids still got the kart a few feet away. \n\nSo yeah, am I overthinking it and being super petty? I just like to ask these things in case it ever happens again if I should say something or not..",

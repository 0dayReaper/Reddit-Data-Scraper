    "postText": "Dear Mr _____\n\nI asked you for help, and used that to your advantage. I know I\u2019d never send this to you because I\u2019d feel like shit. Your a safeguarding lead, you have more then enough problems to handle and I should be able to handle my own problems.But I asked you for help and I told you, well tried to tell you how I felt but you never understood me? You didn\u2019t understand how I felt. Why should I be put in r5 because I was scared to go to class? I was crying my eyes out because the school didn\u2019t do shit about the bullying..I don\u2019t really see how that\u2019s my fault? You said that teachers want kids in class because they consider it to be a safe environment when I communicated to mrs ______ and mr ______ that i didn\u2019t feel safe in class. Me sitting in mrs _______\u2019s office wasn\u2019t a luxury, it had to happen because I wasn\u2019t going to class, I was scared. You didn\u2019t understand how it felt. People making fun of me right in front of me, I felt restricted. I physically felt like I couldn\u2019t say anything and you said rightfully I should\u2019ve been put in r5 for refusing to go to class when my mum called up saying I wasn\u2019t going in beforehand..? \n\nThe two sessions we had didn\u2019t help. In fact it made you one more person to avoid on my long list of teachers I embarrassed myself Infront of. Thanks a lot for telling the teacher I hate that I hated her and thank you for telling my tutor everything I said to you even though he wasn\u2019t even involved. Obviously you had to tell my mum..which I\u2019m not mad about? But showing the teacher I hate the paragraph? Surely that wasn\u2019t needed \n\nI\u2019m sorry for crying last session. I would say it wasn\u2019t your fault but it was. You made me feel like shit, I felt like you didn\u2019t care about my feelings and your reaction to my \u201cattempt\u201d like what the fuck? I\u2019m sorry I only had 7 paracetamol..it\u2019s not my fucking fault thats not enough?..but you\u2019ll be proud to hear since then I\u2019ve improved..21st April I took another 7 and 24th may im pretty sure it was I took another 12 which made me throw up 3 times..I\u2019ve learned my lesson, I\u2019m not gonna tell you any of this because I know if you read this you\u2019d probably feel bad or think that I\u2019m overreacting and I am. But I can\u2019t control how I feel and I\u2019m really sorry for that, for all the hassle I caused you. I\u2019m also really fucking sorry about how cringey that paragraph I sent you was, I\u2019ll make sure to get others to read it beforehand. \n\nIncase another 7 and another 12 isn\u2019t enough soon I\u2019ll be taking 18? I think I have left I\u2019m sure that\u2019s enough for you and if it\u2019s not I\u2019ll risk it and go in my 20s. Paracetamol can\u2019t kill me because I\u2019ll end up throwing it up and I pray no teachers see me throw up like last time. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nTo anybody reading this: this paragraph is directed towards my school counsellor, I know it\u2019s cringey and dramatic but it\u2019s 2 am.\n\nSincerely from ______ ______",

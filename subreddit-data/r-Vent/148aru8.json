    "postText": "I\u2019ve been talking to this girl on a dating app this past week, one of the best conversations I\u2019ve had on a dating app. The conversation ranged from sex, to music tastes, general hobbies, past relationships and a few other things. We had plans to meet up for sex and movies this past weekend but she just stopped replying on the day of. \nThe whole interaction had me excited to meet someone new, even if it was just a one night stand or friends with benefits situation and I was really happy the whole past week. Since she has stopped replying the sadness and depressive feelings are crashing on me hard. This isn\u2019t the first time this has happened but for some reason it feels so much worse this time. I really felt like we could have been friends at least. \nIf she got cold feet or had other plan come up, I don\u2019t see why she wouldn\u2019t just say something instead of just nothing.\nWhy is this effecting me so much?",

You are never ghosted for \"no\" reason, she just didnt want to. Or maybe she wasnt even real. Or had a boyfriend. Or a million other reasons, waste of energy to worry about it imo.",

Yes, it does hurt and I am sure if she had been honest with you, you would have been polite, not mean.\n\nI remember feeling super confused in a similar situation. I was single and pretty lonely, was talking to this guy, went on a date, hit it off great and then he slow faded me. I guess I felt salty about it, was confused *why he wasn't just honest with me?*\n\nFast forward a few years, and I had found our old chat log. With a new, fresh pair of eyes I saw how my excitement to have met him may have been off-putting. Not that there is anything wrong with being excited by someone, but if someone is skittish and not over their ex/past experiences, that can be scary. It's a perspective to consider, and one where you are absolutely **not** at fault, but it helps to understand the other person's perspective so we can move on.",

Back in the dating days, this had some people feel respected and grateful, and others got mad and lashed out.\n\nSome of my friends strongly disagree with me, stating that the world is full of crazies and you should not put yourself in any potential trouble for the feelings of others, who you do not want to continue to interact with.\n\nI don't think anyone is wrong here, just different points of views.",

Basically strike while the iron is hot in that case. Trust me on that one. \n\nIf that didn't happen she could have matched someone who she is more attracted to. Women get an ass load of matches daily compared to what guys get in a month. Best thing you can do is boo ktue date for maximum 2 days after connecting in my experience the odds of it fizzling out after that is high, and after 3 days it's like 90 %. Gotta meet quick and create an in person connection faster than she can find a more attractive guy. Or just work out a lot and look asfuckable as possible . As much as dbag looking guys take flack online they never go hungry.  Could just become that guy but treat women  better..",

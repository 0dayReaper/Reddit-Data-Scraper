    "postText": "I went to see the new Little Mermaid movie last night with a few of my friends. Now, we\u2019re all early/mid twenties. But there were all kinds of people in the theater (families, couples, other groups of friends, even a few lone viewers).\n\nThis theater was packed and everything seemed to be going fine. About twenty minutes in, I heard footsteps cladding down the stairs along the seats. No big deal, I just thought somebody probably had to go to the bathroom. But, no, it wasn\u2019t someone with the need to tinkle.\n\nInstead, it was a group of four middle school aged girls just walking around the theater. They kept walking in circles around the theaters, which I didn\u2019t mind at first. I was near the middle of the theater, so they didn\u2019t block my view and the screen was high enough that people on my level wouldn\u2019t have been blocked either. And I\u2019ll admit, the movie wasn\u2019t as playful as it\u2019s animated predecessor. It was paced a lot slower too.\n\nMy line of patience was drawn when one of the girls said (at a volume that wasn\u2019t exactly yelling, but I could hear from my spot, which meant everybody could probably hear it) \u201cthis movie is so boring\u201d and all the girls laughed.\n\nLike, I\u2019m sorry princess, did you miss the whole commercial that aired RIGHT before the movie began, saying \u201cno talking\u201d. I don\u2019t care if you find the movie boring, if you don\u2019t like the movie, then wait in the lobby for your guardian to pick you up. Don\u2019t spoil the viewing for the rest of us. Even the children behaved better than her. I\u2019m pretty sure the little boy an aisle back who said prior to the movie starting \u201cwhy couldn\u2019t we see Spider-Man\u201d would have also agreed that the movie was boring, but he stayed in his seat and watched it politely because THATS WHAT YOU DO.\n\nAnd before anyone comes at me saying \u201cthey\u2019re kids\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re just edgy teenagers\u201d. I was an edgy teenager too, I went through that phase too. But I\u2019m not that inconsiderate to literally spoil a whole movie experience because I wanted to be edgy. It\u2019s called common courtesy.",

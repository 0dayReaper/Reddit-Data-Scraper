    "postText": "Last time I posted was a few weeks ago wishing illness on my ex out of hatred. I won\u2019t say I got over it, but today was not a good day for me because of what I did.\n\nI went to a massage parlor just to get a deep tissue massage, no biggie. The girl was a beautiful Chinese woman. Reminded me of my ex a lot. I would be lying if I said I ignored the fact she reminded of my ex, but I tried my damn best to just let loose and enjoy the massage. It was an awesome massage, I feel lighter. Then she asked if I wanted a happy ending. I thought she was joking and we both laughed but she took off her clothes and she was serious. Out of pure stupidity I said sure.\n\nThis was not just a bj she and I had pretty much a quickie. Thank god for condoms. I don\u2019t know if she was faking her pleasure but I do know the harder I went the tighter her grip. I would reposition myself at times and she would tell me \u201cno no keep going, I like\u201d verbatim. So I did. Eventually, my time for the \u201cmassage\u201d was up and she still asked me to keep going. It was weird I never had such an experience before (and I\u2019ve slept with escorts many times) this was different.\n\nWhen she and I finally came, she shivered a bit but got up and told me \u201cyou are very good\u201d she said so enthusiastically I thought she was being nice and straight up said \u201cno, you really were good.\u201d I still don\u2019t believe it.\n\nAfter I got cleaned up I started putting on my clothes and she and I started talking. She taught me her language and I know a bit already. Her eyes lit up like fireworks when I proved to her I could speak a little of it. We ended up having a 30 minute conversation. Nothing crazy, just talking about the language, her home, and what I\u2019m looking for in life. She even commented that I have no distinguishing racial features. Yes I mean racial.\n\nEventually, our conversation ended she hugged bye and I left.\n\nIt felt like those clich\u00e9 scenes in a movie. I was happy conversing with her more than having sex. I think I needed this as a lesson. To find someone for their personality and not their body. I will find that person.\n\nThanks for reading.",

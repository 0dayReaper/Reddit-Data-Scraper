    "postText": "I'm a 15 year old female. I'm 5'2 and 110lbs. my bmi is 20 and apparently I'm \"healthy weight\". You'd probably be healthy if there was muscle. I feel like I only have fat.  \nEvery day, I feel so fat. I'm so fat. I can't accept myself in the mirror. The stretch marks on my hips, my chubby calves and arms, my disgusting waist and butt, and everything else about my body makes me want to cry.   \nI'm ashamed to eat in front of other people, because I feel like they think I shouldn't be eating with that much fat in my body. I don't want to run near people, because I feel like they would see my cheek fat moving as I run. I don't want my friends to piggyback me, because I'm afraid they can't lift me even if they're fit. When I hear somebody laughing, I think it's about me and my body.  I'm so self conscious. I'm ugly. I'm insecure. I'm fat. I've been exercising, I don't know what to do anymore.",

But after working out I got down to 200 and stayed there, I dieted and tried eating less. Nothing seemed to work, so I let myself go. I went from 200lbs to 250lbs in about 3 months. I had more rolls than a Cinnabon. So I decided to go back to working out. It sounds to me you are in the same boat I was in about 6 months ago. Find yourself a workout buddy, give it 3 months, then look yourself in the mirror, work everything, your arms, legs, all of it. At 110lbs you\u2019ll gain muscle quickly, I promise you\u2019ll feel better.",

I promise people aren't laughing at you, thats the unhealthy self deprecation starting. Given the chance, it can really get a hold of you and genuinely harm your relationships and health. Please don't let that happen. \n\nOn the other hand there is nothing wrong with wanting to be fit. Giving yourself so much negativity is a bad thing, being abusive to yourself is a bad thing, but its okay to want to be fit.  I really like the quote from Socrates, a great greek philosopher \"It is a shame for a man to grow old, without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.\". This isn't *ragging on the out of shape*, its saying something much broader about self. \n\nDon't be abusive to yourself over your weight, its going to change throughout your life anyways. You can be strong and in control, *be it about your self image or physical level of fitness*. Thats the important part, not the number of pounds on the scale.",

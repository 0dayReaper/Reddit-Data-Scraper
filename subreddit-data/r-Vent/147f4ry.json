    "postText": "These past couple of weeks I felt like I\u2019ve been fighting for my fucking life. It starts out with an intense ass therapy session where I realized my emotions lead to dark places and I have no one but myself or my therapist to guide me through it which led to really strange perspectives on the people around me. My dad proved that when I talked to him, he just kept talking over me and wanted me to listen to him and critiqued my perspective on everything I said. Then on top of that I got arrested because I took the a majority of the fall for my boyfriend even though it was both of us, I did it because his family is worst than mine and hell I don\u2019t even have a family, I\u2019m independent from them. Then my roommate doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with what she wants, she wants to do other things and I\u2019m not mad at her but I\u2019m mad at the fact i had to scramble and change minds everyday and fight for a place to live till about recently which was two weeks after I THINK I found a place to live, then I got into an argument with these dudes and that\u2019s what is really making me explode now. Not to mention an apartment I applied for is threatening to get me arrested AGAIN if I step foot on the property while also threatening to kick out my old roommate which he\u2019s mad at me for. Back to the guy I argued with. He\u2019s just one of those really really provoking little ass boys where they just live to annoy people. Like his face literally looks so fucking punchable, not to mention, he smells of disrespect towards women. We had an altercation , he talked to my boyfriend and I thought things were done. Tonight I get a phone call that was specifically seemed like his girlfriend who has seen me once with blonde hair and proceeds to poke at me behind a caller ID. I\u2019m diagnosed with BPD and stuff like this triggers me to the bone. I had to take my panic attack pills for the first time in months because of how my body was reacting to this. Not to mention school has started for me and I feel as my boyfriend and I are not compatible anymore unless he changes which is not fair to ask but I have changed as much as I could. I tried for the last time to reach out to my parents for any kind of support even just mentally and they didn\u2019t help in any way. I feel as if I\u2019m losing friends and becoming a shit stain person, I feel like I need to isolate and that this darkness is caving in on me. I want to run and hide and scream all at once, I feel as if I\u2019m under water and I can\u2019t say anything and if I do no one will hear me.",

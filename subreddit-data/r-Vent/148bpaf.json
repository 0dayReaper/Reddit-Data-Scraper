    "postText": "I (16 m) and my dad have a rocky relationship, I can\u2019t really cry unless he hurts my feelings or does something to cancel plans that we have. \n\n I have and ex (17 m) we broke up last month. I still dearly miss and love him with the bottom of my heart. We are still friends which to be honest I wish we weren\u2019t friends anymore. \n\n I was looking at his snap story and noticed one of those things that people ask for opinions for say anything and don\u2019t know who sent what. I saw it said where would I take a girl out on a date. I am completely fine that he is moving on it hurts me that he is. I just wish he wasn\u2019t moving on this fast. Yes I know that we broke up a month ago, but it still really hurts me.\n\n I don\u2019t know if I should be mad at myself or happy that I am crying about this, or I shouldn\u2019t even feel sad over this. I just needed to vent because I have a lot on my plate and can\u2019t handle this right now.",

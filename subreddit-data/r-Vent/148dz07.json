I'm not hurting anybody just leave me alone I can't fucking do this anymore. I deserve to live in peace. it's hard enough being disabled in my real life and not being able to see friends in person but I can't even look at my favourite subs without seeing someone say I shouldn't exist. even trans specific places are transphobic at this point, the amount of blatant transmasc erasure is insane, and there's almost no non-toxic trans masc specific spaces online. whenever you say you're trans in a trans-related sub for example you get assumed as transfem, and posts assume that you're transfem and just cause dysphoria (like good girl posts)\n\nI'm dealing with enough in my real life, this is my only escape. I'm practically bedridden most of the time it's not like I can just \"go touch grass\". I'm trying to get a wheelchair so I can leave the house more but I just don't know how to cope. everything is so much and I can't sleep because of pain I've been up for 30 hours I can't do this",

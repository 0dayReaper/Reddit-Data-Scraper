    "postText": "Im 15, lately ive had a horrible time. It started when i was 12 and started having scary thoughts and bad anxiety. Then after i started overcoming anxiety alone at 14-15 i learned how to be at peace with my thoughts and self, and anxiety was just apart of me. It became easier and easier everyday. That was of course until a guy broke my arm. \u201cHe must have some reason\u201d you might think, oh no he said he slammed me just because he thought i said the n word (im kinda white). Well turns out i never said anything (shocker) and he went for the wrong guy. I remember laying on the floor at school while he apologized over and over and begged me not to tell. I felt pain, but also anger so i cussed him out. I pressed charges. Im in the process of suing. I have a fear of people hurting me now since a complete stranger did this. my mom felt i was unsafe in that school (bullshit) but i understand her since shes also very anxious and is scared for me and only wants the best. We told my school to transfer me, they put me into the wrong school\u2026 then when we asked then to transfer us to the right one my old school said \u201cat this point its not my problem\u201d. Wow. Then i had to be transferred to the right one but this time we had to enroll ourselves. It took 3 months for them to reply. They let me in. By this point its had been 5 months since the incident. They told me i was failing. I have now cheated my way through half of online school and am cheating my way through summer school. I am trying to get fit, then my doctor tells me that i need surgery for my feet ( i have a condition called flatfeet and have had it since birth) i wont walk for 4 months and wont run for 6. This means i cant get fit. I hate this. Anyways this felt good to say, i just feel like some good luck may be nice?\nEdit: may i add that you have been lied to! My arm did not get numb, i did not pass out due to shock it was just absolute pain and torture on the ground. So yeah, dont try at home i guess? (In my experience)",

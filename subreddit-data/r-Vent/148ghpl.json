    "postText": "I know this is immature, but I can't help but feel old and unaccomplished. \n\nI had to repeat grades 7 and 8, not because of bad grades or behavioral issues but due to my teachers insisting that it's always better to be the oldest in the class. For the record, I moved schools a lot, atleast 12 times up till now.  \n\nAnd the schools I had gone to can be literally considered \"filler\" schools, all they wanted was more money and what's best than to repeat another year for more school fees. I didn't learn anything during my time in school from elementary to middle to high school.\nInstead of learning the most basic things, we were taught random unimportant stuff. In chemistry for example, we had to write a report on Fritz Haber rather than learn how to balance equations. That's what we did in all subjects, or learn a hyper specific thing without any background (like transcription in grade 8 without learning what DNA is)\n\n I'm a rising senior who's 2 years older than everyone and consequently the dumbest of them all. I'm in one of the most difficult curriculums globally (if kids fail it's more money to repeat the year).  I used to be talented in grade 3 (then again, isn't everyone?), in my middle school years, my teacher were greatly impressed, I was good at art, reading, writing, sciences, humanities and sports. Then pandemic, etc and instead of honing my skills, I became a 17 year old who had the exact same skill set as my 13 year old self . Impressive at a young age but now that I'm older? Not so much.\n\nI don't have any distinguishing features, I gave up any interest in anything as soon as the pandemic started. All of my thoughts had already been thought, any words I formed already formed by someone else. I felt like a cheap unoriginal replica. Oh, nor do I have any friends. I display a different personality with others, jovial and jester like. However I forgot how to puppeteer that personality and let everyone see who I really am. Sad, alone and stupid. I have literally 0 friends.\nIncluding my family and health issues, I'm not any different from anyone. Even the words I spouting as I type had probably already been typed. \n\nWhen I say no achievements and bad grades, I'm not talking about 98% instead of a 99% or being the leader of 5 clubs instead of 10. \n\nIn grade 9, I got a 3 GPA.\nIn 10, a 3.4 gpa\nAnd in the beginning of 11, I got a 4 unweighted gpa and then I moved schools and back to square one. At times I feel I sabotage myself, but my luck itself is shit. I tell myself Im being overdramatic and insipid, that I'm still in my teens until I graduate high school. \n\nI don't measure myself by anything nor crave academic validation or validation of others. I just am. And man do I hate myself. \n\nThis is my first time venting to anyone/anything so I dont know what it's supposed to go.",

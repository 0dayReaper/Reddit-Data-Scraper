    "postText": "so I\u2019m friends with two sisters that are very close in age and I can\u2019t help but always constantly fighting about who gets me and has their time separately with me. I feel like I\u2019m constantly in a fight of me getting shared and I\u2019m always trying to make please the other person make sure they\u2019re not hurt and make sure the other person or not her because I\u2019m always in the middle of their fights and I don\u2019t want to be like that help me. Can someone tell me what to do and how to make both of them not feel like fighting with each other because of me because all I\u2019m trying to do is make sure no one gets hurt and if I\u2019m friends with one of them, the other one gets hurt and never friends with the other one the other one gets hurt and I just wanna be friends with both of them because I love them so much but I don\u2019t know how to do that without both of them getting hurt.",

They need to grow up.",

    "postText": "i\u2019ve been thinking about my ex best friend. she assaulted me almost 3 years ago and i\u2019m so angry at myself. i was fully capable of fighting back and stopping it but i didn\u2019t, i froze and just took it. sometimes i question if it even happened, no one believed me at all. i told her friends what she did and they didn\u2019t believe me, and then she assaulted them. no one believed me and more people got hurt. the worst part is she\u2019s living a happy life, she goes to a nice school and has friends who probably have no clue what she did or they think i lied about it. why would i lie about something like that? do people think i\u2019m that horrible that i would lie and try to ruin someone\u2019s life? i told because it wasn\u2019t the first time i\u2019ve been assaulted and i knew what that would do to my mental health. i wish i never told anyone so that no one thought i was crazy. i hate myself for still being hung up about it, i hate her for ruining me and how much i missed out on because of what she did. i\u2019m supposed to go camping with one of my friends this weekend and i just thought \u201cwhat if they touch you like she did?\u201d and started to freak out. i know they wouldn\u2019t hurt me but my brain won\u2019t stop panicking",

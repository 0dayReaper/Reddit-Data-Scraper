    "postText": "my girlfriend of about two years broke up with me in february of 2022, about halfway through my junior year of high school. as it turned out, she's gay, and she had already confessed to a friend of hers who reciprocated her feelings. they were together before she told me we were done.\n\nlooking back, i can't say it was entirely unexpected. our relationship was fraught with her admitting that her love for me wavered at times, and in the final few months she had started to talk a lot about girls. we never really engaged sexually either, she purported herself as (and genuinely believed she was) ace when we started dating.\n\nwhen we split, i was fine for about a week. i even hung out with her a little bit afterward, at lunch and the usual places. after that, i started feeling physically ill whenever i had to think about her. i got anxious whenever i heard her voice. i couldn't look at her without a big knot forming in my stomach. it was the most excruciating thing i had ever felt.\n\nso, i broke contact entirely. blocked all her socials, her cell number, et cetera. bar about three text messages between us over the last year and a half, not a word spoken. it helped some, but i still feel really anxious and sick whenever i hear her, or see her, or think about her.\n\nworse, i kept running into her in person. i gave up a few extracurriculars to get away from her, but i knew i'd still have to endure her at a few that i wasn't willing to sacrifice. that wasn't all, though. i found her cuddling with her partner on the stairwell at school on multiple occasions -- now im afraid to use the stairs. she started frequenting some of the events i liked to hang out at -- now i dont go to those anymore. stuff like that kept happening.\n\nthe first time she texted me again after we broke up should have been entirely innocuous. standard \"i dont want to stop being friends, please dont avoid me.\" it should have been a nice gesture, and i should have appreciated it.\n\ni didn't. first, i felt a huge pain in my stomach after i read it. it's a little hard to describe how i felt next; i just stopped being capable of feeling emotion for the rest of the day. i couldn't feel happy or sad or upset or anything. it was awful and im glad that hasn't happened since.\n\nthings have calmed down somewhat emotionally since those first few months, but they never really subsided. everyone in my circle of friends is just as friendly with her as ever, inviting her to gathering, et cetera. that's made things really hard.and they have no reason not to! she's an amazing, talented, and funny person. anyone would want to have her around. despite my gut reactions to her, she was never mean or abusive or anything. she's never been anything but kind to anyone.for that reason, i never felt comfortable asking my friends to exclude her from anything. that wouldn't be remotely fair.\n\nbut even understanding that she's pretty blameless, i still hate being near her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni graduated from high school yesterday. she gave a speech, i wore some headphones so i didn't have to listen to it. (i have big/fluffy hair that covers my ears so no one could tell)\n\ni planned on attending a party one of my closer friends arranged for today, but lo and behold, she's going too. so now i'm sitting at home, feeling bad again.\n\ni can't keep going on like this. i know i ought to just put it all behind me and go anyways, because i'm probably not going to see most of these people again for a while, but i'm too afraid. i know that im going to want to curl up into a ball if i see her.\n\ni'm fucking pathetic. why can't i put all of this behind me? why do i still feel this way?",

Don\u2019t do this to yourself if you can help it sometimes the more you think about moving on the harder it gets to do that. But it you have any hobbies or places you like to go when you think about her or the situation do one of those things or go to one of those places. She is your past now literally your high school gf if you ever choose to be friends again that\u2019s great but don\u2019t let the idea of what could\u2019ve been stop you from doing better for yourself. And don\u2019t give anyone this much of your time and grief if they wouldn\u2019t do the same for you.",

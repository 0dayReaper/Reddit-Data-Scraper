    "postText": "I (15 M) feel like my dad weaponizes his chronic pain  \n\nMy dad used to be an alcoholic but he's just replaced those with other addictions he uses nicotine patches and smokes weed via vaping and yes I'm not against stoners but the thing is he's NEVER sober not even at work I don't want to talk to someone who is intoxicated all the time and he's wasted so much money on his addictions but me wanting an 8 dollar boba is too much \n\nMy dad acts like weed changed his life that it was a miracle drug and compares him before weed but the thing is he uses actual medication, supplements, working out no and more alcohol but pins all of his progress on the weed i seriously think hes just addicted \n\nHell our last vacation he refused to go on the beach because he was in too much pain and layed in the hotel smoking it up the whole time I had to push him around in a wheelchair wherever we went and at the time he was around 300 pounds and this was before getting help from doctors so did the weed really make him mobile or was it the doctors \n\nI just don't feel comfortable around him anymore we can never have a conversation without him complaining about his chronic pain and yes I feel bad that he's in pain but shit it feels like he always wants me to feel bad that he wants the mood to stay down when my muscle tore during a wrestling match all he had to say was atleast I didnt have his arthritis\n\nAnd he's always talking about how he's in too much pain to do stuff but begs my mom (F 39) to have sex with him every night and he just keeps on pushing it which of course pisses my mom off because he'll complain about not \"spending time\" with her but by spending time he means fucking sex \n\nSo you're in too much pain to go bowling with us but you can fuck your wife every night and yesterday night she screamed at him \"all you want is sex\" while he cried on the floor and the night before that he said \"I shouldn't have to ask im a married man\" like what the fuck yes you do she's your wife not some sex slave \n\nIt's just so hard to have sympathy for a guy who treats his wife like shit he's a man child while being 9 years older than her it's like my mom has 3 kids because he can't do shit for himself and then blames it on his pain\n\nI'm tired of being my brothers (M 8) dad I'm tired of hearing my dad talk about his pain I'm tired of him not acting grown I'm tired of him pushing my mom to have sex when she doesn't want it I'm tired of everything but he always makes himself out to be the victim why because of his chronic pain he can't be a shitty dad or husband or do anything wrong because he's always in pain \n\nI'm so sick of it and I feel like my hatred for my own father grows with every argument and I feel so awful for not liking my own dad it's been three nights in a row that him and my mom have argued",

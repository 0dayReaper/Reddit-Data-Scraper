    "postText": "This is gunna be fucking horribly written and is just my ramblings. \n\nEver since 4 weeks ago I feel different, I feel like I changed, I dont feel \"there\" anymore. I just feel detached, enough so that 2 weeks ago i attempted to take my life.\n\nI think a reason why is I remembered being raped. For some reason that memory came back even after I pushed it to the furthest resese of my mind. I remember being a kid, not knowing what was happening, and it feeling wrong. I should of been smarter, I should have know, I'm not dumb.\n\nI think I might try again, I don't want to live knowing my whole life seems to be a test. I only recently got over my crippling fear of going outside. And now I remember the thing that robbed me.\n\nWhat do I do, keep trying? Keep trying for what??\nThere is nothing I can do to get that chunk I lost.",

    "postText": "My father made me work at a corners office and it was the most horrible job I\u2019ve ever had. Dead where bodies everywhere and the smell was horrible, I can still smell it when I think about working there. I have horrible nightmares and thoughts about it, one time their was this little girl that came in and she was f\u2013ked by her dad. She was an 11 month old little baby girl. Her little legs were broken back behind her and he just f\u2013ked her like a toy doll and chucked her in the bathroom. It was the most heinous thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life and I still have nightmares about it. That\u2019s all I feel comfortable taking about, that job was hell. DO NOT WORK IN A MORGUE!",

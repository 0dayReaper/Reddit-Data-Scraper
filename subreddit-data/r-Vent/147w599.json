    "postText": "I wish my favorite person never even existed. I know FP is associated with BPD n such and I genuinely do believe I have BPD but my parents refuse to let me get checked out. They gave me a therapist that cannot officially diagnose their patients with anything. But anyway, point is I\u2019m not self diagnosing. Back to the subject, I love my FP dearly. Heart wrenchingly. But they\u2019ve hurt me so much. If it was anyone else they would\u2019ve been dead to me by now. They were there for me when the closest person to me in my life, my great grandmother, passed away. This is where I think I got attached to them. My mom says that throughout my young childhood years that they were always so mean to me but I don\u2019t remember it. I moved away but we still talked over the phone. Later, for over a year we dated. Towards the end of our relationship, around my birthday actually, they decided to tell me that they were polyamorous. Which was fine with me, I didn\u2019t mind. Im glad they told me I just didn\u2019t want an open relationship like that. Before telling me they let me know that they thought they had a crush on someone a year younger, who was taller, and more funny I guess. That broke my heart but I remained calm with them and I tried to do more. Be more. I felt like I wasn\u2019t enough since they wanted another person in our relationship. It didn\u2019t matter that they told me I was enough, I didn\u2019t feel it. I was more, and then I was too much. In January 2022 they broke up with me because I was too much. Then after a couple weeks we started talking again. As friends. Then we had another fall out because I was being too clingy. They told me they were going to fucking kill themselves and were posting on their story about it, and they were being serious. Out of panic I spammed them and their parents whilst sobbing on the floor, wondering if my best friend was dead. That was being too clingy. In September after that we started talking again. They were in a polyamorous relationship with 2 people, both over 18. I didn\u2019t want to be that ex so I didn\u2019t tell them that this wasn\u2019t okay. It\u2019s not my place either. Later they broke up, the adults turned on the child. Surprise. They\u2019re fucking pedophiles. I let my bestfriend be in an online relationship with pedos. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore though, they\u2019re over it. Earlier this month though they told me I was the only one they had ever actually loved romantically. And god I could feel all those attachments I tried so hard to bury come right back. But of course when I\u2019m attached AGAIN, they\u2019re gone. This weekend they sent me 8 texts. 8 3-1 word texts. Usually we\u2019d send over 100 a day, especially on a weekend. I didn\u2019t want to be annoying so I pretended it was fine on Saturday. Sunday they sent me 3 texts. 2 words each. Despite my \u201cHey how was your day? :D\u201d and \u201chey I\u2019m just checking in in you\u201d I didn\u2019t get anything really. They didn\u2019t even send a goodnight text like they always do. It bothered me a lot so I asked if I did anything wrong. They said no and that they were busy, as in drawing for themselves and ignoring me. They also told me that they were going through some stuff mentally. This just made me feel like a chore. They didn\u2019t tell me that they were ignoring me, they know that\u2019s my biggest pet peeve, but I know they were because if they were drawing, it was on their iPad, which is connected to their messages. At some point I even asked to call and all they said was \u201cnope.\u201d They never use the period unless they\u2019re serious and that\u2019s how all their texts have been. I then asked one of their friends who go to school with them if they were okay. They proceeded to tell me that my bestfriend wasn\u2019t there today but then showed me their Instagram stories. It was 2 secret accounts they never even mentioned to me. In the stories they were so happy, explaining their drawings and commissions and that bullshit.\nWhat the fuck did I do wrong?? Throughout 9 years of friendship I\u2019ve only ever been angry with them 3 times including now. I\u2019ve always been their for my bestfriend NO MATTER WHAT. And they\u2019re giving me this??? Am I being an obsessive asshole or do I have every right to be upset abt this??",

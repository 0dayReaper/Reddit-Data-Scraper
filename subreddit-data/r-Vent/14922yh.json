    "postText": "My mother (58f) is having a breakdown because im(26f) in therapy.\n\nRecently due to a life event I had moved back into my mother's house until everything is sorted  id only be there until december. I have new temporary employment since i had to move back to the state she is inand I do pay her rent in forms she asks for (water bill here, groceries there, deep clean on sundays, etc) which is what we agreed to since it isn't a permanent situation.\n\nWe've never gotten along, a lot of neglect, physical and verbal abuse, resentment and what have you during my childhood has left me with a rather sour taste in my mouth regarding her, and after graduation i moved out immediately and essentially we became estranged so I am greatful she allowed me to stay at all.\n\nFast forward to this week, I was in a rush and left a note pad that I write down, thoughts, feelings, and quotes/advce from my therapist in during and after sessions, on the coffee table, which she went through and read. My therapy is usually childhood/teenhood/parent related as that's where a lot of my issues stem and what a lot of what I write is about. I learned that she had read them when I got an angry call from her while at work screaming at me that im a disrespectful liar and that we need to talk. \n\nWhen I returned home that day I was met with her asking what 'this was all about' refering to my notes, to which I explained that I've been in therapy for a few years to work through my own personal problems. She once again called me a disrespectful liar, and that if I want to slander her and how hard she worked as a parent, and how much she tried her best, it won't be while I'm 'freeloading under her roof'. Telling me I had the weekend to find somewhere else to go or she would have me escorted out by the police. I told her that was fine and did exactly that, I called around for a couple of days and found an old friend who is now letting me stay.\n\nThis was however another issue to her apparently. and i have been getting dozens of calls and texts a day saying that im causing her emotional distress, im a horrible child for speaking ill of her, she failed as a mother if you own child is so mental she has to lie and pay for help..and I could've at least fought to stay at her place instead of running away, or apologized for lying, or offered to take her to a session so she can sit in, which obviously can't happen.\n\nMy sessions are private and unnecessary for anyone to know about, not even my partner knows what goes on or is said. and I'm only doing what she said by leaving so I don't feel I'm in the wrong however the backlash I'm getting is becoming unbearably exhausting I want to go no contact again but I'm wondering if it would be helpful for me to go back and use what ive been doing in counseling at home with her",

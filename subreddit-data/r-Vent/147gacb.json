I\u2019m a teen in a conservative state and recently i\u2019ve been feeling hopeless. A few months ago we got bed bugs and we can\u2019t afford anywhere else to go or to throw away furniture. I don\u2019t know what to do because there\u2019s so many now . Recently my siblings also got head lice . I\u2019ve been trying to avoid it but it\u2019s hard to not be scared every time i feel an itch. We have always had cockroaches so i feel disgusting . I\u2019m living with almost every disgusting bug rn and no one knows . I\u2019m scared if my friends find out i\u2019m doomed to be lonely . I feel so hopeless . I wanna lay down and cry forever and hope my problem goes away.I have no one to talk to about this and it\u2019s so stressful it feels like my brain could pop. I don\u2019t wanna keep doing this anymore .",

    "postText": "My (F16) bf\u2019s ex (F17) began verbally harassing me out of nowhere. I don\u2019t know her that well. We had English class together last year but we never talked. I know my bf and her dated last year. \n\nShe and I go to the same high school. My bf goes to a different high school. Im guna call his ex Taylor. So I have P.E 1st period and she has P.E 2nd period. So I usually pass by her on my way out. Every time I pass by her I don\u2019t really think anything of it, I\u2019m just trying to get to my next class. \n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, she made it clear that she had a problem with me. As I was walking out, she very loudly said , \u2018fucking bitch\u2019. I was kind of confused but I brushed it off. I didn\u2019t think she was talking to me because like I said I don\u2019t know the girl\u2026 we\u2019ve never interacted or talked or anything. That was the first time so I simply brushed it off and went about my day. But the days after that only got worse. She would loudly say \u2018fucking cunt\u2019 or \u2018fuckinggg bitch\u2019 everytime she passed by me. Her behavior was the same if I passed her in the halls. Now it was clear as day that she hated me for some reason. \n\nIm not the confrontational type. Im really shy and awkward. Im not aggressive in any way. I keep to myself and mind my own business. Now Im no Saint but I sure as hell did not do anything to Taylor that would justify her acting so hostile and nasty towards me\u2026.. im assuming she\u2019s angry bc im dating her ex?  \n\nI let my bf know that his ex was harassing me and I asked him if he knew anything as to why she was behaving like that. They are already broken up and have been broken up for a while. Soo wtf was going on? He said he doesn\u2019t know which I believe is bs. \n\nMy guess is that he\u2019s seeing her behind my back and she\u2019s angry that I\u2019m still in the picture. And if that\u2019s the case, she should be angry at my bf for not breaking up with me. But idk no one is willing to give me answers. Taylor absolutely despises me when i havent dont anything to her. This is so unfair to me. I truly have no idea what\u2019s going on. Im not a pot stirrer, I would never start up drama for no reason. So im confused and frustrated. Taylor still harasses me every day at school. And idk what to do. Im also stressed and losing sleep over it. Taylor is pretty much bullying me every day .",

I wouldn\u2019t flat out accuse him of still seeing her, if that was true knowing the type Taylor is she would\u2019ve bragged about it by now. Unfortunately she\u2019s mad at you that you have something she doesn\u2019t. Since you\u2019re the quiet shy type it\u2019s not worth coming out of character to confront her, that\u2019s why I\u2019m suggesting letting your bf do it for you.",

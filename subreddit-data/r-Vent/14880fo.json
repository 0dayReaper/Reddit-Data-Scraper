    "postText": "Although I love my younger sister there are things that she does that I hate so much (and I\u2019m sure she feels the same way). I\u2019m two years older so there\u2019s always this expectation for us to be friends ever since we were kids. \nAs a kid I\u2019ve always been an introvert, played alone and was never really aware of what other people might think or feel which made me struggle to understand people\u2019s emotions and body language. On the other hand my sister has always been outgoing and loved having people around here. So whenever we hang out together with other friends I stay in my shell because why would I need to \u201ccome out\u201d if she\u2019s here and all over the place. This happens until this day (im 20 and she\u2019s 18) and I wouldn\u2019t say I envy her more than I hate being a shadow whenever she\u2019s with me. I automatically shut down whenever someone knows me and her. I immediately become quitter and in my own little world like when I was a kid and that says a lot because I have changed ALOT and I hate how whenever she\u2019s with me I go back to feeling like a kid. She has a good heart and whenever we hang out a lot it\u2019s all fine but if someone else is in the mix we become distant and I hate that. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m saying but I\u2019ve been holding on to this for so long that I feel like I can\u2019t physically keep up with this. I feel like I need a break from her like a year off break and I can\u2019t help but wonder what would life be if I WAS an only child or at least not have her as a sister. I don\u2019t want anyone to get the wrong idea and thinks she\u2019s a bad person or anything like that because she\u2019s not she\u2019s very sweet and cares about me dearly. But remember when I said I can\u2019t understand emotions very well? Well it\u2019s the same thing here I don\u2019t understand how she cares about me and wants us to be close if there\u2019s this unspoken thing where we both are holding like some kind of grudge on each other. I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s from childhood or somewhere in our lifetime but I am 100% certain where are NOT ok atleast on my part. She also has thing where when she gets angry very quickly and immediately starts calling people names and just has no filter at all. And I\u2019ve never been good with words so I feel helpless when that happens (as kids I used to fight it off physically but now it\u2019s just annoying it\u2019s like I want to shut her mouth up. I want her to grow up.) I don\u2019t know what to do now because I cherish our friendship if you can call it that but I can\u2019t keep holding this thing inside me I have so much things to say that I can\u2019t put it in the right way and there\u2019s so many emotions that I\u2019m feeling that I literally don\u2019t understand. I feel like I\u2019m going to explode everytime I\u2019m near her.  Anyways I just needed to get this off my chest because yesterday we had a semi fight and when I told her I wanted to talk she gave me her back and left me so I blocked her and now I\u2019m not going to speak to her unless she comes to me. Anyways if you have read until here thank you and if you have any tips on how to work out my relationship with my sister I would love to hear it.",

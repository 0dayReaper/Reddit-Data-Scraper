    "postText": "So, I was just driving home for lunch and need to change lanes to get to the proper highway. \n\nIt\u2019s bumper to bumper traffic (I live in a major city) but there\u2019s finally an opening so I start to change lanes (my blinker has been on for a couple minutes already) well the car that I\u2019m changing lanes infront of immediately SPEEDS up and presses down on the horn and tries to prevent me from changing lanes. We were maybe an inch from side swiping each-other.\n\nAt this point I\u2019ve committed and can\u2019t really do much and was already halfway into the lane but they keep going forward so I\u2019m forced back into my other lane which almost caused a collision cause like I said I was halfway into the other lane so traffic kept going in my original lane. \n\nWell, I finally end up changing lanes and still end up a car in FRONT of the car that tried running me off. ALL of that just for me to still end up in front of them. \n\nI hate people",

    "postText": "Important information: When I was about 3 years old I witnessed my mother get murdered by my father, he did this due to my mother not wanting to be with him due to abuse. This led to me going to therapy. My mother is dead and my father is in prison, my sister and I became orphans for about a week or so, we were later adopted by my grandparents (which bless them for their kindness). For the past few nights I have layed down in bed thinking about my future when I started to think about going to college, getting a good career, getting married, maybe having kids, as I was thinking this I remember I don't have young healthy parents, I have grandparents who are tired, stressed, and not young full of life. When I grow up and  become an adult I most likely will not have a dad  nor a mom to celebrate me when I get in to college or  when I get a lover I will marry. I just what I'm saying is I won't have a mother, a father nor my grandparents when I'm older. I would really like to appreciate my teacher's who have shown their kindness, love, and support. Mr. Z and Ms. A, I see you as the  father and mother figure in my life so thank you for your kindness. \n(From what you read I bet you can suspect I am not an adult but a minor)\nThank you for reading.",

We were in a rush, I barely know what I'm doing and the new girl wouldn't stop asking me 10,000 fuckin ?s  while I was trying to figure shit out myself.\n\nIt's a fairly big mistake. When she sees it tomorrow she gonna be pissed.\n\nFml lol. I'm tryna not think about it and just be big chilling but really it's a big deal.",

We're not supposed to take anything wrapped in plastic or paper.\n\nLady dropped off a mattress wrapped in plastic for return. showed me a chat screenshot of Amazon telling her just to wrap it up. So I took it against my better judgement. \n\nShe was literally just telling me about that this morning and that sometimes the drivers won't pick up items if they're wrapped like that.\n\nThey won't take it. And there's no phone number on the label for the customer. So now we got this fuckin mattress and I can't do shit about it.\n\nI texted her but no answer and I left a note on a sticky label paper on the mattress.\n\nShe'll see it tomorrow morning. And when I come in later I'll probably get yelled at or fired. I hope I'm just yelled at but idk.",

Literally just got told about it. \n\nAnd then I did it with a massive queen size mattress lol. I'm just glad my manager gets there before me so there's not going to be any stress about what's going to happen when she comes in.\n\nAs soon as I come in I'll hear about it and whatever happens happens.\n\nI got a buddy who can get me into a lawn mowing/landscaping job so it's not all a loss.\n\nI probably am overreacting but I don't know. The size of the item makes the size of the problem bigger, especially with no way to contact the lady",

But she is going to be angry.\n\nThe issue is basically I accepted it and told them it was okay, And even if I didn't, our policy is to hold on to wrongly accepted items for a certain amount of time before we can throw them away.\n\nBut it's a queen size mattress lol. It's not fitting in the recycling bin or the dumpster lol. And there's no where good to put it in the meantime. I'd be willing to get my dad's truck and go to the dump but yeah lol.\n\nThe other part of the issue being once they don't get their return they are going to be pissed, And they're going to say \"The guy told me he could take it\" \n\nBut also they've got two pretty new people working with a brand new person who honestly isn't getting it. I get we're short staffed and there's only one manager but we could have used the manager lol.\n\nTo be fair my other coworker who's about as experienced as me maybe slightly more, also thought it would be okay. So at the very least I've got someone to vouch that we thought it was okay.\n\nBut the brunt of The blame falls on me.\n\nIt's just like every time I feel super confident like I know what I'm doing and I'm like a \"real employee\" something comes up that I don't know what to do, I go with my gut and it's often wrong. \n\nAnd all this weird crap that I haven't come across before always happens after the manager leaves",

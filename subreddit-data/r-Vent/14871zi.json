    "postText": "My ex &amp; I were eating outside during covids intial appearance &amp; a homeless man asked for food we already ate from. I gave him the partially consumed food in a leftover box but before I could offer him a bottled water her attitude changed and she literally became enraged that I fed him. We easily could have purchased more for ourselves but she only saw it as I gave good leftovers away. It was pizza it wasn't a steak or anything expensive. It doesn't matter because the man was hungry!\n\nI've always swore to never turn a hungry person away if I could feed them. I grew up in a impoverished neighborhood &amp; my mom would feed any drug addict that knocked on our door as a kid. I didn't understand then, but I do now. I understand it because I'm a victim of several abusive circumstances from my childhood (not mom's fault) and have gone hungry recently because of medical issues. Your stomach literally hurts when you're hungry, I've been there and had no one to help us simply eat a meal! I skip meals now to ensure what little I have doesn't run out. I just can't wrap my head around her being angry about feeding someone. Like really?\n\nLong story short we eventually split, but I think I dodged a bullet with that one or should I say I'm to kind hearted to leave a person hungry. It truly shocked me how she treated that guy, most of all it kinda hurt cause what if that was me? Even if I have to boil rice, share from my plate or buy food for someone I will never turn a hungry person away if I can feed them.",

Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that your kindness to others is unnecessary or upsetting! \n\nWhat you mean to that stranger is something that has  no price tag on it. You deserve someone who will cherish your kindness and return it, not just to you but to others as well.",

I try to put myself in their shoes and I imagine most of them are just trying to make it to the next day.\n\nYesterday I went out to eat with my gf. On the way back to the car a lady came up to us just asking for some help and giving us some insight into her situation. All we had was a $20 bill and we were on the fence about giving it to her. In the end we decided to let her have it and she began crying about how she was gonna run to McDonald\u2019s to get some food.\n\nWe sat as we watched her walk off. I told my gf \u201care you ok with having given her the 20? Odds are she\u2019s just gonna go to a liquor store or use it to buy drugs\u201d. She said yeah it\u2019s just a 20 and even if she does buy booze or drugs we can\u2019t blame her for just trying to make it through another day. \n\nWe kept watching her walk down the block and she finally stepped inside somewhere. She lied about McDonald\u2019s but she went to a Mexican restaurant instead. And I immediately said \u201cdamn I\u2019m wrong and I feel like a dick\u2026. I\u2019m glad I was wrong\u201d idk if I believe the woman\u2019s story or not but I hope that she\u2019s eventually able to turn her life around.",

We stopped at a new pizza place one day and got ourselves a small pizza. He noticed a homeless man walking around, so after I finished my share, he asked if I wanted to give it away or keep it. Of course, I chose to give it away because there's no point in letting someone be hungry while I have perfectly good food and the funds to get more. \n\nI think my bf is making me a better person.

You know what the school did when I ran to a teacher to report it, after banging on a door for 15 mins BEGGING for help mind you? **They stuck me in a fucking room. Alone with these two girls. For an hour.**. \n\nSchools say they \u201ccare about your kids\u201d. When in reality. They care purely about money, and just the popular kids. That\u2019s it. Throughout my entirety of being in school. The teachers and or any staff. Always took the cool \u201ckids\u201d\u2019s sides. Like wtf?\n\nTheir version of \u201csolving\u201d issues between young kids at this point, is having them duke it out or fend for themselves which is absolutely pathetic.",

I'm glad for you,I had an easier childhood then some,that's for sure so I know I didn't have it as hard as I nearly could have. That being said,based on your answer,it's safe to assume you didn't have three bullies live in your neighborhood who you couldn't escape from who you lived next to for 9ish years.   I'm guessing you didn't have a neighbor who's life goal was to make you suffer and cry. I'm guessing you didn't have a next door neighborhood bully who's parents also disliked you too so anytime you want to them,they would just laugh at you and deny it.   I'm guessing you didn't grow up in a very dysfunctional home.   I'm guessing you never went to your parents about something and they \"fixed it\" only to make the problem far far worse for you.   It's almost like I learned this advice because it works and it was the only thing that worked for me.   I finally told the bully next door I would fight it.   I gave it my all,he definitely beat my ass but I could tell  they actually respected me more after that and after that,they weren't as hostile towards me.(I also moved like two months after so that also fixed the problem)  if a bully sees you as an easy target,you'll never escape from them.  If you tell on them,it shows that your weak and are scared of them.   Bullies feed on that fear.   Growing up in middle school and highschool Is actually pretty similar to animals in the wild.  You have to mark your own territory and be ready to defend it by yourself or with some help of a close friend.     Things get better though once you become an adult.   Bullies never quit but they typically stop being violent once you age.",

HOWEVER  \n\n\nagainst bullies there are 2 ways to go about handling them, one is underrated that no one takes seriously, and the other is what you just said.   \n\n\nfirst solution is to stop reacting to them and as fucked as it seems, play into it. I had adults tell me most of my childhood that to deal with a bully, if u give them a reaction they will continue to bother you. My father is middle eastern and my mother is from mexico and being in grade school when 9/11 and swine flu were a fresh thought i was berated all the time.   \n\n\nAs soon as it came to a point where i had no energy left to \" stick up for myself \" and just gave short responses to those bullies ( yup, mmhmm, sure whatever you say ) they get bored relatively quick and you remove the fun out of them picking on you. Now that im out of school the majority of those bullies dont think to bother me even if they see me because i had a chill reputation with others in school so picking a fight with me makes them look like an ass to everyone else now. This advice for the OP is arguably the most brutal as it comes across as you taking shit and not sticking up for yourself ( but if the bullying is that bad and you dont give a fuck what others think about you then its probably not as bad )   \n\n\nto your advice that everyone is downvoting. There is some merit to it. People pick on the weakest link in a group, i might get downvoted for this but i myself turned into a bully for a brief amount of time BECAUSE the kid i was picking on was \"weaker\" than me in social status. Granted when middle school started i saw him getting picked on by 2 bigger guys and came over to tell them to fuck off and help him up ( had a reality check over the summer ). My point being, if i didnt approach those other 2 bullies with the confidence to tell them both to leave him alone ( despite being smaller ) they would have continued to pick on him and throught middle school that kid didnt get picked on afterwards because the bullies assumed he was liked by others if i was able to stand up for him. Aggression can work in some situations but if someone approaches u with the intention to get a rise out of you, snapping back or getting angry at them is giving them what they want, if they want to believe they can get away with that stuff as far as being physical with you or crossing a line that you made yourself then sticking up for yourself physically is not the worst option.  \n\n\nas for school resources/counselors they are absolutely fuckin useless, I tried multiple times myself and they just give the other kid a slap on the wrist and send them off not realizing they just gave that bully more ammunition against you",

            "comment": "Okay so this is going to be an honest, vulnerable response and it will involve my own sexual assault trauma. \n\nI was repeatedly sexually abused by an older boy when I was somewhere between 11-14 years old. (I can\u2019t really remember, I had just moved after sixth grade when it started and it went on over all for a while, until like 8th grade? But there was another older boy involved at that part). \n\nAnyway, when It first happened, I was confused and conflicted and I went to tell his girlfriend what had happened but I said that I had sex with him because of how confusing the situation was.\n\nShe brushed it off. \n\nShe went and told the whole school and everything. \n\nEveryone thought I was a whore. Kids kept asking me what it was like and what happened etc etc. \n\nSome people even encouraged me to let him do it again. \n\nIt took a long time for me to find the right words and to find the way to respond. To figure out what I needed and what had happened and how to move on. \n\nI didn\u2019t press charges or accuse him or anything for a long time- but in high school I finally started telling people the truth. A boyfriend and a few friends. \n\nThen, I tried to tell his then exgirlfriend who brushed me off again and said \u201cdon\u2019t even try to tell me he raped you\u201d so I didnt. \n\nLong story short, I guess- is that people are going to react differently and crudely and rudely. I even had a school counselor tell me it was my fault because I had been a virgin. (Which for the record any age under 18 or even under 21 or even higher than those ages are perfectly fine ages to be a virgin). \n\nIt\u2019s not how they react, it\u2019s how you react. \n\nBe kind to yourself and find an adult you can rely on and trust- tell them. Work on finding your voice. Your truth and who you want to be. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone your story or your trauma and no one can tell you what was or wasn\u2019t traumatic for you. \n\nPeople are jerks but you\u2019ll find the ones who aren\u2019t. \n\nTalk to a trusted adult- and get a therapist, if possible. A real one, not a school counselor. \n\nRemember that what happened isn\u2019t your fault and just because it\u2019s not how other people are used to seeing sexual assault represented as, doesn\u2019t invalidate what you went through or your feelings. \n\nBe kind to yourself and forgive yourself for the shame and guilt and other bad feelings this kind of thing brings. \n\nYou\u2019ll make it out one day to be a person you deserve to be. I promise, it does get better. It just takes a while and a lot of work on bettering yourself. \n\nYou\u2019re not alone.",

You deserve help for dealing with your trauma. You don't deserve to be revictimized by your peers like you have been, and it's a serious problem that they're being so callous. While you can't force them to understand, they shouldn't be able to get away with being shitty to you about your genuinely traumatic experience. I can't tell you for certain how someone else will react, but there are adults who would want to know and help you. If an adult you talk to doesn't take you seriously then there's nothing wrong with going to one of their superiors.\n\nYou don't deserve abuse from your peers, and they need to know that their reactions are not ok. They should be corrected for your sake as well as anybody else in a similar position as you.\n\nIf you are unsure of what to do then it could be a good idea to contact a local crisis line for help. They can talk you through your options and direct you to resources for help.\n\nIf you're in the US you could contact RAINN: https://www.rainn.org/",

Rape is rape. \n\nSending hugs to you OP, I'm so sorry you've been made to feel so invalidated.",

    "postText": "I (nb 20) have a few friend circles, as one does. I have my college friends, who I've known for almost 2 years. Of this group, there's one other person with a driving license, and like 4 with a permit. \nAs for the other group, I've known the majority of them for 3 years, but my friend that introduced me to the rest of the group has been like a sibling for almost a decade. This group *technically* has more people, but there's really only 4 or 5 of us that still chat consistently. Of these few people, I'm the only one with a license. One has trauma from driving, so doesn't have anything, and I believe 2 others have their permits. \nQuick bit of background, in my college group, there's been a few health scares that required going to the hospital. The hospital near school is way nicer, but the shortest wait on all these visits was 4 hours minimum. Our other option was a hospital in my small town 30 minutes away. It was farther away than the big hospital, but there was almost never a wait. So, on these more urgent trips, we went to the smaller hospital. My dad finally got fed up with me having to take people to the hospital and getting nothing in return, so banned me from driving my friends to medical things all together, even if they offered gas money or food. \nFast forward to tonight, I'm home for summer break because I can't afford an apartment, and a friend from the smaller group, we'll call them P, asked me if I could take their partner G home. They were 30 minutes away from me, and G's home was 15 minutes away from there. In return, P offered to buy me dinner (It is quite late at night and I haven't eaten in almost 10 hours, and because of sensory issues, there's not much food I can eat at home). I double checked with my parents because I share a vehicle with my siblings, and they said no. Because they don't want me driving all over the place. Which is fair, but these friends have only asked for a ride home one other time, which I turned down because of my dad's rule. \nYou may ask: \nWhy'd they ask me? Isn't there someone closer they know? Probably. But G feels safest riding with me, we've gotten really close. \nDid this come out of the blue? No. I chat with this group every other day if not every day. It's definitely not a case of them only reaching out when they need something. \nWhat about an Uber or a bus? It's late, and the bus doesn't drive by where they're at. They'd have to walk over a block in the dark in an unsafe area. As for Uber, first off G doesn't feel safe with strangers, but also they're very obviously genderqueer in an unsafe area, during pride month. \nIdk, I'm pissed and upset. I don't get to see any of them during the school year because they all work nights and weekends, which are the only times I'm free from school. And my parents, who have only met P, don't like P because they're also queer. So leaving during the summer to hang out has never gone over well.",

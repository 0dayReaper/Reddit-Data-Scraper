    "postText": "I really shouldn't call it a crush anymore. I have very strong feelings for my co-worker, who is also a very good friend of mine privately. She has a boyfriend, and a best friend who is like a brother to her. After these two, I'm the next closest person in her life, apart from family of course.\n\nWe've known each other for around three years, but have only been close for several months. We've talked about us, and we both agree that it's insane how good our relationship has become after only a few months. I love her as a friend too, I really do, but I wish we could be more than that. She's the nicest person on earth, and she's so beautiful too. I don't eat a lot when I'm around her, and I start missing her after an hour of not seeing her. It's been like this for weeks now. I don't know what to do. I want those feelings to go away, but it's just not that simple.\n\nI don't think I've ever had such strong feelings in my life. It hurts. I'm getting a motorcycle soon.",

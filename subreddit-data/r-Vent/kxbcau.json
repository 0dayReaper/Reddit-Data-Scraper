    "postText": "There\u2019s a trend going on on TikTok where Americans who now live abroad explain how they realized America really \u201cscrewed them up\u201d. One person explained how they live in the Netherlands now &amp; they were confused about the number of sick days his job allowed him to have. When he was told that there are no limits, he said that he kept asking the question because he couldn\u2019t believe that the Netherlands didn\u2019t tell you how many sick days you were allowed to have. \nAnother person said that they were pulled over by the police (I can\u2019t remember what country this was) &amp; their heart was beating out of their chest &amp; they kept their hands on the steering wheel, didn\u2019t move, &amp; looked straight ahead. He said as soon as the officer approached the car, he immediately told him that he can relax, got straight to the point, &amp; gave him a heads up that he was speeding &amp; to slow down. \nThis shit REALLY bothers me because we\u2019re taught that we\u2019re the best country in the world &amp; we have this &amp; that, but the ppl here are led to believe that everything is a luxury, including respect and sympathy. I\u2019m so glad this country is being really exposed for what it is.",

After using her insurance, she ended up owing $65,000 &amp; she cashed out her 401k to pay for that &amp; now she can\u2019t retire.",

So if you're an introvert and they choose you to speak or sing one of the above you will stand in front of every student, in Elementary or High School (depending on your grade level).",

(i am british)\n\nwhy would your government sink BILLIONS into this thing i heard of called \"veteran care\" and the majority of your veterans not even want to use it because of the low quality.\n\nwhy not instead disolve that and re-use the funds to create an NHS style system.\n\nan independent group that gives medical CARE (not insurance good god obama care was such a bad idea) as well as running a public ambulance service.\n\nthen theres the american police force, compared to the british police the american police force is criminally under trained and funded.\n\ni keep seeing stuff of american cops using a gun when they should be using a taser. (using a gun to disarm) or even a american cop going in, flashing his gun and his muscles then expecting criminals to cower.\n\nif a british officer needs to stun he either uses his fists or a taser and if he ever needs a gun he will kill NOT INJURE.\n\nedit: theres also the fact that american police do not communicate.\n\nhere in the UK if you are being chased by the police lets say from winchester to southampton via eastleigh they will catch you in eastleigh.\n\nthis is because they will radio to the station ahead and a trap will be set up.",

However, I wanted to point out, especially given the recent events, that there are so many things that we pride ourselves on ,as one of the top nations in the world, but behind closed doors we\u2019re really struggling in major areas. There are nations with free &amp; better healthcare &amp; we have to fight for that. The same countries that we usually speak negatively about are moving on from COVID &amp; we have people here protesting the use of masks! We spend so much of our federal budget on defense &amp; the military &amp; we now have veterans who can\u2019t get the proper care when they come back. America will cut funding for education before they cut down the budget for defense. \n\nNow depending on who you ask, surely you might get a different perspective &amp; opinion on America. The problem comes in when people DENY other people\u2019s perspectives. Prime example: BLM protests have been a thing for YEARS &amp; people came up with \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d or \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d as a counter-protest. Our president sent troops to defend the nation from BLM protests but it took about an hour or two for the National Guard to fight off the people storming the Capitol while the President sat on Twitter. Now those are the type of people that will stereotype Muslims or the Middle East but think they aren\u2019t doing anything wrong by rioting because they didn\u2019t like the outcome of a democratic election. \n\nI watched those videos thinking why can\u2019t we have those things that everyone else has. People are calling for the Police Departments to properly train &amp; educate their officers, as well as decrease their funding because there are so many cases of abuse of power &amp; nothing being done about it. Instead, police officers just got new Teslas. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m complaining. I genuinely believe I\u2019m just pointing out the hypocrisy &amp; lies. Democrats &amp; Republicans have become a joke! At this point, the only thing it\u2019s doing is further dividing everyone. It may have run its course. Bernie Sanders is a socialist &amp; has proposed a lot of great things that I think will better this country, but people worked against him twice &amp; we\u2019re stuck with the same system. It\u2019s kind of a theme here. We\u2019ve become the class clown of the world &amp; I just want to see us do a lot better.",

I used to aspire/look up to the US as a developed nation myself, I mean for many people in developing or underdeveloped countries especially 20-10 years ago when I was growing up the US was seen as the symbol of freedom and the dreamland. I would say that image was largely influenced by the American media and film industry, but also because of the quality of American products on the market. However, once I went to the US and I actually saw what it\u2019s like for people living there, I realized it\u2019s not exactly perfect either. Especially, if you\u2019re from a lower middle class area. I lived in an area that so happened to be lower middle class, so I actually met and interacted with a lot of people who were struggling financially, drowning in debt, or whatever to make ends meet. I also noticed how different their lives were compared to where I came from not just culturally but financially as well. I do agree with you that free healthcare and improving education should be a priority. The quality of education in high school was abysmal compared to where I came from, I went to HS and it was a piece of cake, I didn\u2019t have to study much; whereas back in my country it was impossible to achieve good grades if you don\u2019t go for private tutoring after class. The focus also seemed more so on sports and prom, rather than on academics. I guess maybe that\u2019s why a lot of the students didn\u2019t seem that interested in getting to know about where I came from, because they were more concerned with their own lives. The drama that was happening in school and all that.  Some also had issues at home, some were placed in foster care, I mean I get it. These issues are serious issues. Especially, crimes and abuse. They\u2019re alarming high for a developed country. \n\nI do wish the best for everyone, I don\u2019t agree with the American foreign policy. Especially after the Iraqi invasion of 2002. I think a lot of people from my region started viewing the US negatively after that, it has caused a cascade of problems, but I think that\u2019s more due to misunderstanding of what the Middle East is and it isn\u2019t. I think the Bush administration thought that they could turn Iraq into another Germany, but they don\u2019t understand the tribalism, ethnic groups, or the mentality of the people found in those nations. They\u2019re not democratic, there is a reason why it doesn\u2019t work effectively over there. However, I can see how many people might see it as the US trying to gain power and control over foreign territories and just mistrusting them. \n\nLike I said, I realize that the domestic issues are incredible and I have been following them closely, it would be great if the US can focus on solving these issues you listed and if they would just focus on those for the next 10-20 years, instead of middling in or starting new wars overseas. I do wish the best for the American population and do think they deserve better overall.",

            "comment": "Born and raised in the States but I left about a decade ago due to being fed up with the politics, racism and general culture of the place. It just dawned on me that if I ever wanted to see any of the cultural changes I wanted to see I'd have to go somewhere else. My quality of life changed pretty much overnight in several ways.\n\nFirstly, I'm now the type of person who just goes to the doctor to get checkups or if I'm ever feeling a little off. People here go to the doctor for colds. I had an endoscopy a few years back in another country and it was free. I would never have imagined my having such access to healthcare back in the states. I was once hit by a car there (I was on foot, turns out I was bleeding internally and had a broken leg). Still had the presence of mind to take a cab to the hospital. I outright refused to get in the ambulance. The EMT said \"if you're bleeding internally you could die\" I told her that I didn't get insurance through my job and I'd rather just die than pay $3K for something I could get for $20! I meant it too; I was in bad financial shape at the time.\n\nThe racism: I'm from NYC. I felt like 'stop and frisk' had put a giant target on my back. I'm well educated, never been in any trouble, I had a good job and lived in a nice place. Didn't stop these guys, a couple of whom KNEW I lived where I said I did, from stopping me on the regular. Finally I got so fed up with it that I moved about in the States for a while, from city to city, trying to find a place I could call home. However after a pretty scary case of mistaken identity, I realized that the problem wasn't any one place, it was the race-obsessed culture of the whole place.\n\nFor example, I remember once I got pulled over in the States in the middle of nowhere and the armed and clearly agitated cop kept asking me if the woman in the car (white) was my girlfriend. Neither of us could understand why he kept asking us that and we were both a little scared to tell him that she was. So we kept dodging the question. I've just never been anywhere else where such a dynamic would/could even occur no matter how far you drove out of the city.\n\nIt's toxic there. And constantly having to worry about people and their stupid, bullshit problems with you affects you and shapes your perceptions of the world and other people in ways I didn't want mine to be shaped. Sometimes you don't feel like being an \\[insert skin color here\\] guy, just a guy. In the US that was almost never possible. Most other places I've lived it's OFTEN possible. Yeah the US is dangerous, certain areas are scary, but worse than the fear of harm I think was being made to suffer the unremitting stupidity of way too many of my fellows.\n\nAs I said, I finally just came to understand that If I wanted to live someplace I was proud of, where I felt safe and where the prevailing notions of common decency were a better match for my own I'd have to leave the US altogether. So I did and it was the best decision I've ever made. Of course I'd imagined I'd probably move back someday when things improved until I came to understand that things will never improve there.\n\nI've spent six months or longer in a bunch of other countries now, traveled to many more and I've never been anywhere worse than the US. Of course there are bad people everywhere, but never have I been anywhere where so many of them live in the same place.\n\nWhen I first left, one of the first places I went was Copenhagen. I remember roaming around that city for days suspicious of everybody being so damn nice to me. It took me several more countries and a couple more years to realize that's just how sensible people treat each other. It's almost like I had to be deprogrammed from living in the States.",

In Middle School, 6th grade was Ancient History, and 7th grade was Medieval History, so no US there yet, but in 8th grade, we do US History again, and they certainly covered more and gave a much more accurate picture of events. Then 9th grade is Ancient history again, and I'm taking AP World History now in 10th grade, and again, it does cover a lot of the atrocities committed by the US, and various other countries as well.",

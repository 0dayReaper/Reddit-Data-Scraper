    "postText": "okay, so..\nI don\u2019t use my phone a lot, at least not during the day.\nWhenever I don\u2019t use it I ALWAYS put it on my nightstand so it\u2019s charging.\n\nI\u2019m very obsessed with my phone battery, I\u2019m not sure why, if it\u2019s below 50% I get really anxious and scared it\u2019ll randomly die and never recharge or something.\n\nme and my dad share a computer inside his room, I don\u2019t have my own so I use it whenever I play video games.\nAlso my dads room is at the end of the hall and my room is to the left at the end of the hall.\n\nand as I am playing my dad walks up to me with my phone and tells me my cousins called me, but the weird thing is he came from (what looked like) the end of the hallway and not my room.\n\nI had my phone is my room, I\u2019m 100% certain. And when I looked at my phone it had lost a slight bit of battery.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m paranoid, maybe I somehow forgot that I brought it to the living room, maybe he went through my phone.\n\nI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s bugging me.\nI also don\u2019t understand why\u2019d he go through my phone? I don\u2019t do weird shit online (except using this app) and I don\u2019t understand what I could\u2019ve done to make him feel the need to go through my phone.\n\nAm I just being paranoid? I feel like if I mention it to him he\u2019ll get even more suspicious and if he hasn\u2019t already looked at my phone he probably would then.",

Both good and bad, don\u2019t filter anything. How would they know if you\u2019re struggling worse case? I use to hide weed from my family, eventually i told them about my pot usage in high school, they ended up supporting me but wouldn\u2019t give me money for it. That made me more responsible and more controlled. Your family will always love you, that\u2019s what they\u2019re for. Ask your dad if he went through your phone, it may lead to something worth talking over",

I keep mine in a backpack under my desk neatly hidden in a corner. I have so many of them, whatever you think of. My mother was cleaning one day and i saw it taken out and it was put against the wall. To this day i still hope she didn't have a look on what's inside it.",

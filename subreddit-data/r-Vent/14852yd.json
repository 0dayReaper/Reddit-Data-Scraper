    "postText": "I bought a refurbished headset. Its a great headset but it reeks of cigarettes. Honestly how does anyone smoke that much inside that your stuff smells like it after its left your house and sat at store. Its disgusting, and i can only imagine how terrible this person must smell. Ive tried cleaning it but it wont leave, everything it touches ends up smelling like it and it makes me sick. This smell is the one smell i absolutely can not handle and get immediate headaches. Very annoyed.",

            "comment": "Omg. Yes. I get bad migraines from the smell of ciggarettes. I haven\u2019t seen half my family in over a decade. Well I decided to give it a try being my grandma is so old. But even though she knows i was having a major migraine she continued to chain smoke in her house as usual. I couldn\u2019t stand to be in her tiny place marinating in it. I stayed at my aunt and uncles house. They also chain smoke inside. Thankfully they keep the windows and doors open. But i was in agony. All my stuff stinks and had to do a ton of laundry. Took two weeks of not using my pillow that sucked up all the smoke. It\u2019s really frustrating. I could live in my aunt and uncle\u2019s basement and go to school in that city and probably not pay rent. But i cant do it. Its awful",

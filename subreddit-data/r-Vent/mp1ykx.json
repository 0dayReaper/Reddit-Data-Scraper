They either try to help the victim get help in some way such as a counselor or something but do very little to the bully ya know the one causing the victim their problems in the 1st place?\n\n\n\nAlso STOP PUNISHING VICTIM!!!! Why is it of a kid is being whaled on by an asshole kid the second that kid hits back they get an equal or sometimes worse punishment then the kid who was beating them HOW THE FUCKING FUCK IS THAT FAIR!?. Like what do schools hope to achieve buy doing that? All that does it make kids not wanna speak up about it or defend themselves because your teaching them \"oh if you defend yourself you'll be punished\" like seriously all your doing is discouraging kids from standing up for themselves.\n\n\n\nTruth is schools don't give a shit if a kids being bullied cause if they did niethier of these problems would exist.",

When I have kids I'm going to teach them they need to stand up for themselves/fight back. You can't count on the school to protect you or advocate for you and that's fucked up",

Then while changing for PE, the other girls would do everything to stop me from seeing them getting changed, like I'd actually be attracted to them lmao. That eventually built up to them sexually assaulting me (grabbing my ass, touching me really inappropriately, ext) and then saying that would give me \"something to get off to\".

Victims of crime are talked about by many through various campaigns, speeches, \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d, but never actually helped when they need or even ask for it. And when someone defends themself from a crime, especially violent crime, the victim often receives punishment equal or greater to that of the criminal. It\u2019s horrendous and directly ties into modern American culture, which further divides people by class, race, and religion which is likely creating the tension we see today.",

I eventually withdrew from high school as quickly as I could, I started college early, and it was better.. but it was hell every year of school, nearly every day.. and it was always horrible people working in the schools, and in charge.. I believe even all the way up to the superintendents were unfit for their positions.. more parents should probably call the news, etc, I'd even recommend being vocal on social media, in ways where you can share your experience, but in a smart manner to avoid even more trouble.

But I remember telling one of my pals I had a crush on a girl in our class. That little shit told her what I said then she completely avoided me. Some of the friends I made turned their heads and ignore me too. I was wondering, \"what the hell did I do wrong?\" Then that was the first time I heard/understood the word: rumor. I hated being in class. Kids making fun of me and doing whatever they could to get me in trouble. Soon after, word about me liking this one girl spread throughout the other classes that it seemed impossible for me to talk to anybody, with the exception of my best friend.\n\n\n A few months roll by and I come home to my mom on the phone with the principal. The principal recieved a phone call from the girl's mother about some \"unusual things\" her son has been doing at school. After she hung up she sat me down and asked me how/why I've been \"sexting\" this girl from school. [Keep in mind, I'm in the 6th grade so I didn't know what \"sexting\" was before this point. AND, I wasn't given my first phone until four years later. All I was into was zombies and samurai Jack] \n\n\nI told my mom what really happened and I didn't get help from her. I ended up being grounded anyway because of the phone call. Days later, I find myself in the principal's office asking for proof about these accusations being made against me. The principal didn't do anything, I told her I don't even own a phone. All in all, I ended up getting in-school suspension for 15 days because of something I didn't do. We ended up moving again so once I started my first day in middle school I did my best to keep quiet about who I liked and just kept my head down since then. Shit is demoralizing.",

What can a school really do about a bully? Detention for a long time, not that it will do anything..suspending the student for a short time...the student comes back later anyways....and expelling a student which just sends the problem to another school. I guess if the bullying is serious enough police can get involved...but none of these really solve the problem..schools need to have proper counseling services to help learners suffering from anxiety, depression and other disorders. And teachers must be trained to recognize if a student has a disorder and monitor all student behaviour and not ignore bad behaviour even if if its just name calling or simply pushing a student out of the way.. teachers must recognize group bullying and ways students isolate the person they are bullying. Students with problems with Empathy, understanding consequences or maybe even understanding right and wrong must also be rooted out and adressed.",

            "comment": "Teacher here: I have my own opinions on this matter and my own knowledge of the research around bullying, but I would be curious to hear what current or recent students think is the best solution.\n\nFrom my perspective as a teacher, I think there are multiple reasons that bullies persist.\n\n* Bullying is done mostly covertly. For obvious reasons, outright bullying is done when teachers aren't looking. Despite what your elementary teachers might have told you, we do not have eyes in the backs of our heads. So, I rarely see it when it happens. \n* If I do see it, it's usually a mild verbal form which is often hard distinguish from a two-directional ribbing between friends. It's  hard to know how the victim is taking it. There are lots of toxic behaviors happening almost constantly in schools. Often, it can seem like appropriate response is to provide advice, because, again, you never know all of the context. \n* Bullying without violence is also hard to articulate in paperwork, so I doesn't get tracked as closely. Unfortunately, most teachers--myself included--brush off these incidents too often; we just have more urgent issues to tackle.\n* The causes of bullying are rooted outside the school. I don't think the stereotype of the bully with the rough home life is always true, but certainly a great number of things are going wrong in your life if you decide to take out your frustrations on innocent peers. This could range from insecurities to any form of prejudice: racism/colorism, classism, sexism, trans-/homophobia, ablism, etc.\n* Punishment, in my experience, doesn't really do much to deter bullies. It just causes them to get better at hiding it.\n* My own mini-vent: students hardly ever report it! I'd like nothing more than to slam that one rude kid with a trip to the counselor and/or suspension. I'd love to get that kid on a behavioral contract or into restorative justice sessions or finally force his parents to send him to therapy. I can't do that if I don't see it and those who do stand by without intervening.\n\nThat said, what do you think would actually help?",

If a teacher can predict with almost certainty that a child is a bully why ignore it? It\u2019s inhumane. Furthermore kids need to talk about who\u2019s being the little pricks on the playground. It isn\u2019t new. It\u2019s been going around for generations but it is almost taboo to talk about it.",

You care about your child but the school as a system doesn\u2019t care about your child. It\u2019s trying to get a return on an investment. School is a system built by another system to turn your children into what the system needs for it to function. Not all bullies become bosses.

Past marred with unhealed hurt, unpredictable present that's ever shifting and always seeks out to get me, petrifying future that I just know is going to eat me alive- and nowhere to really call my home, not one that feels like it\n\nWhether it's by school or by trauma or my beliefs about myself or the fear of my approaching adulthood...I'm getting pretty crushed. Of course I can't have this, but I truly feel I need a break. From everything, absolutely everything",

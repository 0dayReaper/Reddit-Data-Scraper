I can't believe that she hasn't been fired for her shit. The evidence is unreal, she's a manipulating bitch. I seriously hate her so much for what she's doing to him. This whole scenario is bullshit. I really hope karma gets her soon. I will never watch any movie with her name attached to it.",

It still makes me sick to my stomach to think that a man had to not only deal with emotional and physical abuse, but then the town laughing at him for speaking up. She ended up losing her job because of it and i don't remember the judges sentence, but it was found true.",

Amber Heard broke the law, she did it in America and she did it in England. She perjured herself in court on two continents and is suffering no repercussions for her actions because she is a beautiful woman in the public eye and has publicly accused her now ex-husband of multiple counts of spousal abuse and assault. she lied and there is ample proof to show that she lied, there's a video of her saying that she lied. this is the example being set for young girls who go to see her movies and like her enough to look her up, this is also the example to young men to hide themselves away and don't dare approach a woman on any grounds whatsoever. This is an issue happening to all of us right now. \nTo suggest otherwise is naive and genuinely an attempt to misinterpret the situation. It is irresponsible to do so.",

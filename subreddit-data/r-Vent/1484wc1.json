    "postText": "I was dating this guy in Feburary, and I absolutely loved him, and I still do, through that may be the teenage hormones speaking - though I'm not the type of person to just fall in love, typically it's one person, and for a long period - he was so patient and kind to the fact that I had never been in a relationship before, and never pressured me into things. He would reassure me that it was okay and I can take my time, and that he will wait. I was the same back, I was patient with his busy schedule, boundaries, and his emotions, he was a pretty emotional guy, scared to not be Mr.tough around everyone and would only let his walls down around me. I still remember the sound of his giggles qhen I tried to understand the concept of bikes.\n\nWe were perfectly happy and adapting to eachother taking steps as slowly as we wanted, but then he started distancing himself from me in mid April. Obviously, it's 9th grade, so most people probably won't take this seriously. \n\nWe have the same friend group that started to divide slowly after he distanced himself, but one person remained going between the now divided groups. The groups became divided once he decided to end things with me late april. Turns out there had been another girl since late march/early April, and this girl (i found out about her through the friend that was geavitating between groups), is a controlling rich bitch to put it shortly. She's been known to blackmailing people into doing things she wants for her, and frankly, my ex didn't look to hot for awhile, I would see the decline in his mental health.\n\nAbout a week ago my group once again slowly started talking to his group, and we got in a few good laughs. Throughout the week I also noticed he would gravitate near me, and would look at me a lot.\n\nToday he talked to me for the first time since he ended things and blocked me on every social known to man-kind. It was a nice conversation, then we made fun of my current English teacher that he had last semester. I thought he had been toying with my emotions throughout the week, but I saw his eyes sparkle with joy I haven't seen in a long time, not even when I would briefly see him run to his friends (our groups still sat next to eachother) saying he won his muay thai tournament. I've also realized that he's no longer around that other girl anymore, and she seems to be quite pleased with how he hadn't been talking to me. Considering the fact she was glaring DAGGERS at me in health after she saw my ex and I interact.\n\nI dunno, I'm on the fence about me being toyed with, or it's the other girls fault. He's a sensitive guy, who at the end of the day just wants to ramble about bikes, his dog, his dreams of becoming a nurse, and how his mum makes the best grilled cheese at 2am.",

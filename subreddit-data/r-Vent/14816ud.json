    "postText": "my s/o knows we had a long weekend and i barely slept because I had to drive cross town all weekend to pick up and drop off her friend to their job. 7am pick and 11:30pm drop off. we went to work and i got off and went home and cleaned up the house including poops from 3 big dogs :/ i told her i wanted to chill and watch movies at home with her but now she wants to go to said friend\u2019s house to hang out later in the evening. I don\u2019t mind the homies but I would like some time to chill and possibly a nice ass thank you",

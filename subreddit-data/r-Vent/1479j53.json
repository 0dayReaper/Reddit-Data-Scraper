    "postText": "This is an old story that I have only told the 2 people I am closest with. However, I now wish to spread this story because this situation is awful and I just hope others who may (hopefully not) end up in a similar situation, find this in order to clear your head and make the best decision you can.\n\nAt the time, I (24 male) had become close with a 20-21 female (her birthday came after I started dating her). This was also during the pandemic era, so already kinda a red flag looking back at the situation now. Pandemic was a time where everyone was on the internet and I should have knew better. At the time I was going through a terrible heart break from a recent breakup. Stupidly, I got close to this woman who I shall call Charlotte for the remainder of this story. Charlotte was in a relationship at the time of us becoming close friends, despite me having no knowledge of this. She had a terrible life growing up and from that, she admitted she never really had a good relationship. Keep in mind, this was all happening over a social media app. So at the time I had no plans on dating but just being good friends with her. \n\nFast forward a month later, we confessed our feelings of each other and things escalated from there. I was now in a long distance relationship with Charlotte. Charlotte had an ex who she still spoke to because he meant a lot to her. I knew I should have seen that first red flag but I was dumb. Admittingly looking back at it now, I was unknowingly using her to get over my relationship before which isn't okay but at the time I genuinely thought I was in love with this woman. Her ex was cool with me so I let the situation go. However, they would get into arguments over social media. Not normal arguements but petty arguements that seem like something couples would have. It just rubbed me the wrong.\n\nWe also had this mutual friend, 14 female (at the time I didn't know she was 14 as I was told she was 18), on the same social media app that I will call mandy for the remainder of the story. Mandy was cool, very out spoken in the community that Charlotte and I were involved in. However, in dms, those two were becoming close friends that would talk about anything, everything, and stay up all night talking together. This was never made aware to me until I started noticing the little jabs Mandy would throw at me. \n\nCharlotte and I would get into arguments more frequently the more time went. It always felt like it was her, Mandy, and her ex against me. Charlotte would vent to Mandy while also venting to her ex, despite me constantly telling her to come to me and open up to me. I wanted communication with her but she never did really want to. Then with Mandy being a mutual friend, I went to her 2 times to vent about my relationship with Charlotte and Mandy would turn it around on me.\n\nEventually this led to Charlotte breaking up with me the first time. Despite the breakup, Charlotte and I still did things that we would have only done under the premise of being in a relationship. While being broken up, she gave me the communication I wanted during the relationship. I admit, I flipped out because the situation was bullshit and I felt used. \n\nThroughout that long distance relationship, I was doing everything I could to become the \"perfect man\" she wanted me to be. In hindsight, I was made aware that she was mentally manipulating me and I never noticed because it's all things my mother did to me all my life growing up. I never had knowledge on toxic femininity because my own mother was one of those toxic females. Gaslighting, playing victim, toying with my emotions, this was stuff done to me all my life and was never taught about it, so I didn't know until after this relationship. \n\nI suppose me bringing out my toxic masculinity and flipping out on her because I wanted better but still \"loved her\" made her like me more so she wanted me to give her another chance. Stupidly, I did. We continued dating all while, unknown to me, she was also dating Mandy. This woman that was able to buy alcohol was dating a 14 year old. I must also preface that mandy lived closer to Charlotte than I did. So while me and Charlotte once had plans to meet, Charlotte could drive to meet Mandy more often than to make plans with me. Still, Charlotte played us both making us believe that she was only dating whoever she was speaking to. Things weren't going to be easy to keep that going however. So Charlotte eventually came clean and even admitted to me the actual age of Mandy while also admitting they were dating. Charlotte still wanted to be friends and I accepted but the thing I wanted most was closure. \n\nI never got that. I was miserable because within 3 years I was dealing with 2 heavy heartbreaks, and 2 deaths in the family. I tried to move on and started dating other women but Charlotte would get mad at me and hated how I was giving my attention to other women. So we had our arguements as friends until one day we blew up on each over social media, said some petty shit to hurt each others egos, and blocked each other on everything. Though even then, everyone in the community we were involved with saw the bad things she had done to me and didn't let her manipulation slide. \n\nThe reason why I am venting now is probably because I feel kinda guilty maybe? I don't know why I used to have nightmares and feel depressed over this. Then as I reflected on the entire situation, the light bulb clicked. \n\nWhile my ego was hurt that I lost a grown woman to a teenager, I realized that Charlotte was a predator. I think I began feeling guilty that I let my sadness and heartbreak cloud my better judgement and not bring up to my community the fact that Charlotte was dating a minor she could drive to in order to physically touch and see. Charlotte also asked me to not tell anyone about it and I kinda dismissed the comment at the time because it was right after the final breakup. \n\nNow that I am doing better for myself and not focused on a relationship, I realized that Charlotte was a fucked up human being. A demon if you asked me. The worst part of it all is that if I were a parent, I would kill anyone trying to date my child if they were an adult and my child was still a minor. Charlotte was a mother of 2... dating a minor. She took care of those two kids on her own (which I was willing to help take care of once her and I were to move in together because at the time I thought I was madly in love with this woman). As a parent of two young children, how could someone be okay with being a predator? \n\nAnyways, kinda glad to get that off my chest. If anything, this situation was experience for me to know better in the future. I know my worth and won't be a doormat for others in the future. I also won't let my ego cloud my judgment and risk letting bad people continue to live life with no consequences of their immoral actions. \n\nCharlotte if you ever see this, I hope you have gotten the therapy we spoke about because I don't wish death upon others but what you did to me for that year and a half, that was murder on my soul. As much as I despise you, I hope you did get the therapy and are doing better. If you're stuck in your ways, well I hope karmatic law has been doing it's job then.",

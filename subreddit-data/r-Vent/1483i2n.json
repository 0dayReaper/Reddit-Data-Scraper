    "postText": "Hello I(M15) hate my life. You might think im just going through a phase or im a emo but no, I just want everything to end and be happy once and for all.\n\n\nSince childhood, my life has been shitty, because I always heard/see my parents argue at the point of getting physical.\n\n\nMy brother used to bully me by calling me things like fat, pig, etc. You might think thats normal because thats just  a sibling thing, but no, he literally hated me and I hated him too. A few months ago, he stabbed my mom in front of my eyes, and guess what? The police didn\u2019t do anything about it! Just because he was a minor. And guess what? This wasn\u2019t the first time this happened! My brother tried to stab my mom many times but this time he actually succeed just because they would always get on arguments over some stupid shit. What\u2019s worse is that this entire situation would have been prevented if my mom didn\u2019t escalated the situation or sent him to a mental hospital. But no, my mom is very religious and she thought god would fix things. Ok then, then why god didn\u2019t appear and didn\u2019t stopped my brother from stabbing you (this one of the reasons why I stopped believing in god and have a deep hate to religion)? What makes more angrier is that my family still treats him like a saint. I just wish that a tragedy happens to that miserable  waste of sperm.\n\n\nI hate when people dont listen to me or dont believe me.Yes, I know I lied a lot when I was a little shit but I changed. I talked with a friend who I trusted about this but instead they dont believe me or call me emo and then they make fun of me. This happened TWICE, never in my life I felt so betrayed. Everytime I try to do things better, I get called useless or annoying.\n\n\nMy school life also fucking sucks. I sometimes get bullied and im always lonely, everytime I try to make friends, they only faked friends with me or ignore me. My grades are a 50/59 I sometimes do ok or just horrible. I also changed schools a lot, all of the were the same(except the current one I am at least people treat me better).\n\n\n\nLastly, my mental health is decaying. I dont know if im depressed but I dont want to say anything until I get an actual diagnosis. Also, everytime I get intrusive thoughts, and I shake my head to get rid of them but everytime I do that my mom thins im faking it. Im on the verge that I want to end it all.\n\nI wish I could write more about my problems and traumas but I would need to make an entire fucking thesis about that.",

But the biggest suggestion i can give you is to concentrate on school. I was able to graduate when i was 16 and left home. If your space is toxic then start planning your escape. Concentrate on school and get a part time job and try to spend less time around the toxicity. Hugs. Hang in there",

But here goes. \n\nI had a very similar sounding early life. \nNot going into it because this is about you. But the point is, I feel you. \n\nI'm in my 30s now. I survived. \n\n2 things I wish I could tell my younger self... \n\n1. School doesn't last forever. Once you're out and you are allowed to choose the people you associate with and what you do, you will be much happier. \nYour performance won't define you. \n\n2. Bail on your family right now. They're killing you slowly.",

            "comment": "Talk to a trusted adult, whether that is a family member or a teacher at school. Teachers are ALWAYS better to talk to than counselors, because they really really care about you and will fight for a change. Call the CPS too, tell them all of this. Make your mother show them the stab wounds or even get a picture of them somehow, no matter how you have to do that. you need to be out of that house. Admit yourself to a mental hospital if no one helps. write everything down on paper, go to the ER, tell them you are about to end your life, and show them the paper. Call a friend to take you there, or call the suicide prevention hotline and they will send an ambulance.",

When things are like that at home it affects everything around us and our well being..grades..etc. Is there anyone you can talk to? I promise you life will change for the better and I know you think right now there\u2019s no light at the end of the tunnel. You have a lot of good things ahead of you in the years to come. And I didn\u2019t think that either and I\u2019m now 41 and doing alright. I spent a lot of years anxious and severely depressed because of my mom. She took a lot of years from me and I\u2019m still mad I let her. The most important thing you can do is help yourself if no one else in your house wants to get help. Sure seems like they all need it. But most important is you.",

            "comment": "I totally feel you. I hated my life back when I had your same age. My brother would bully me all day long, was also bullied at school for being nerd, \"ugly\" or bad at sports, my parents were fanatical evangelicals so they never listened to me and always pointed out my lack of devotion as the cause of my problems. However, I can assure you things got better because I focused on my personal goals. Even of that implied ignoring the people that bothered me at all. I started making friends with people with success mentality, workers, students of higher age, not losers who just wanted to play sports, drug themselves, bully people, fist-fight or just chase boys or girls. Focus on your studies if you can, go do some exercise (walking and running is free and will help clear thr noise in your head). Hang more with the people around you who make you feel good. Start cutting ties with with those who are abusive. About your parents, you cannot change them but if you focus on making your life better they will understand what you really needed someday. It took me years to realize all this, but you have the chance to start now. You can decide who bothers you and who can't.",

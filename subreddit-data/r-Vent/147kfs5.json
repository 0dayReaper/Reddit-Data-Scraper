    "postText": "I need to vent:\n\nThere is someone at work who yells at me *all the time*. Even when they like what I am doing, they find a reason to yell at me or put me down. I am not their subordinate, they are not my boss, and it might be that they are doing this to everyone. I am not going to bring this up with HR, I am not going to make any formal complaints, this person is due to retire at the end of this month. \n\nI just want to vent about it here because it's annoying, literally makes every nerve in my body tense up and it makes what could be a fun work environment into a nightmare. \n\nAlso, as if the yelling isn't degrading enough: the environment has constant gossip and drama. As the old saying goes: if they are constantly talking badly about others, they are probably talking badly about you. \n\nLuckily, I can avoid this person, but when I cannot it makes me leave the work day feeling so tense, stressed and not ever wanting to go back. It is so frustrating, but I just grin and bear it and remember it's only a few more weeks of this. \n\nAlso, maybe I should be tougher and not let this stuff get to me. ",

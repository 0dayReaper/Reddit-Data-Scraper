    "postText": "it's 1am in the morning right now and I can't stop crying and hating on how I look.\n\nI don't think I'm very ugly but I'm not the most conventionally attractive person either.\n\nMy biggest insecurity is my teeth.\n\nUp until middle school, I never really cared.\n\nBut from high school, I noticed how crooked and small they looked so my parents spent a lot of money on braces to straighten my teeth.\n\nEven after taking my braces off, my teeth are still small. My gummy smile makes it worse and my gums are inflamed and make my teeth look smaller than it already is. My bottom teeth goes downwards so it makes my mouth look weird. When I smile, my mouth forms into a weird shape and you can see the excess gum. Even my closest friend makes fun of my teeth and calls them fish teeth because of how small they are. \n\nBecause of my teeth, I never smile in any pictures with my teeth showing. Having bad teeth also turned me into a more introverted and shy person who doesn\u2019t talk even if I badly want to, just so I don't show my teeth to others. \n\nMy mouth also moves weirdly when I talk to cover up the excess gum showing from my teeth. And even though I like to laugh, I cover it up with my hands to hide my teeth. I stick out like a sore thumb because I still wear my face mask to cover my teeth up from other people and they probably can see how insecure I am. \n\nI hate this so much.",

Realise this impact but also realise no one really cares about your looks.\n\nI love when people smile even when their teeth is not the best. It brings me joy seeing someone laughing. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard, but please don\u2019t focus on your and people\u2019s appearance. Start being present and listen to people. Think about what content to say. Listen to the birds/music. Eat all the yummy food. Feel your physical sensations when you shower. Try using your other senses to engage with people.\n\nI would rather talk to someone with great conversation then someone with good teeth but no conversation.",

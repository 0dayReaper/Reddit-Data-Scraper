    "postText": "I waited to see the new Little mermaid for a few weeks because I wanted to go with less people there and I achieved that goal I went and there was like 2-3 families with there kids but then this group of teens walked in sat right by me and my bf and were loud the whole time singing loudly to each song especially part of your world which since I even heard this movie was being made I wanted to hear the most. All of the children were perfectly quiet and behaved nicely while watching it was just we happened to sit next to a loud group of teens. It\u2019s just a movie I know but I looked forward to it for a really long time and I wanted experience it in full. Just a little disappointed if it\u2019s still in theaters I might see it again.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m graduating from college later than all my friends. I\u2019ve been really happy to see everyone dressed nicely and surrounded by friends and family and take official pictures and things like that. My family is pretty small and we\u2019re not really even connected emotionally the way a normal family is. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019ll graduate and just feel intense loneliness.\n\nI know it\u2019s wrong to compare to other people but I want my parents to plan a nice graduation party for me and to have friends and family give me gifts and hugs. I wish I could have even a boyfriend too and just be surrounded by tons of love and support.\n\nOften times I feel like I have to be 5 people to get myself through everything and cheer myself on. I\u2019m grateful to have taken myself so far but I really wish I could just FEEL like people love and care and are proud of me.",

    "postText": "One day id say about 5 years ago i was hanging out with my \"friends\" at break and one of them who we will call fred came up with the idea to play truth or dare. As this was taking place i was just hanging back not really participating just looking at the people playing basketball.Eventually its freds turn and he chooses dare. One of my other friends at the time we will call him Jason. Told fred to tell one of the little kids to go smack one of the most popular girls in my year on the ass.Eventually they get the little kid to go do it. So as promised he walks up to her and smacks her on the ass. Around this time i go to the bathroom.And as i walk out i am met by jason and another one of my friends at the time.They both sort of escort me to were fred and the popular girl from before were standing. As i walk up to them i say \"Whats going on\" and immediately after that the popular girl starts saying \"Did you do it\" and i say  \"Do what\" and she keeps repeating this over and over again until she smacks me across the face.I didn't react and turned around and attempted to walk off. As I turn around i see all my \"friends\" blocking me in.After this that girl kept harassing and abusing me. This just shows how fake people can be.After that happened two my friends dated that girl one after the other.Even though they knew damn well what she did to me.If you want to know what happened to her? Well when i told a teacher about all the times she had abused and sent death threats to me and harassed me.The only thing she said to the girl was \"Dont do it again\". I think about this everyday.",

    "postText": "I just graduated highschool, I should be happy. But I just feel like Im supposed to do another year, like I missed out on one. Im afraid Im not gonna be able to socialize, I only have 2 of my real life friend's social medias, and I asked one of them to get my other two friends to add me, but they havent yet, I dont know why. I emailed them both anyways over school email.\n\nI just feel lost and scared Im not gonna be able to socialize. I live in the middle of nowhere after all. Im afraid and unsure of what to do next. I just want to stop feeling afraid and sad like this. I feel like I only did 3 years of highschool when I know I did 4, I just did one at home due to covid and I dont even remember anything from that year.",

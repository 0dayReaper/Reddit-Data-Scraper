    "postText": "for context; i grew up privileged but not? i went to boarding school on scholarship, my mom was rich but spent all her money, and i chose my college accordingly. my mom said \u201cpick something good and in state, bc i can\u2019t afford anything more\u201d.\n\ni worked 20-40 hours a week on top of 4-5 classes (~17 credits per semester), knowing i would graduate with debt, but not as much as my friends. \n\ni hear some of my (mid 40\u2019s-early 50\u2019s) coworkers complaining about loans and financial stress of sending their kids to college. they\u2019re saying how stressful it is about transferring credits and the cost of summer courses, how their kid has no place to live there anymore, and in the next breath they\u2019re firing off excuses about why this kid can\u2019t work because anxiety or course load is too heavy. \n\nyou\u2019re paying for your kid to go to an out of state college when they don\u2019t know what they want to major in and CANT AFFORD TO LIVE THERE???\n\ni\u2019m just like.? very confused. people always told me i was spoiled because i had a fallback but i don\u2019t think i ever really realized how hard i worked not to use it until now. \n\ni just don\u2019t understand why you would go to college if you don\u2019t have a specific degree you\u2019re working towards and if you\u2019re questioning it not going to a state college which is MUCH CHEAPER.",

It has such a whimsical mysterious feel to it it makes me want to jump up and down and cry and get everything out. I cannot understand anything that is going on in that song except for the lyrics but it completely takes over my attention. Its like I'm on shrooms again and everything is just so swell. I guarantee you if you heard it you would write it off as shit music but it does everything right for me.\n\nWhat a beautiful piece of art :)",

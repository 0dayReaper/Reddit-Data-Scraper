I had a great day with my boyfriend today and for some reason I\u2019m just not feeling it. I don\u2019t know how to explain that. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m not feeling him, I love him, I\u2019m thinking of him, and I already miss him, but I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m just not feeling it. It being what? The whole relationship experience? Is \u201cit\u201d unrelated to that and instead related to day to day stressors? Well, it could be about him, but if it is about him, why is it about him? He seems to be exactly what I need right now. This is what I asked for from the universe. This is what I got. I was convinced that I absolutely needed this. He genuinely cares for my well-being. I was lacking in the physical touch department, something that really matters to me, and he is able to fulfill that need for me. He\u2019s gentle with me. He\u2019s understanding, he moves at my pace. I can talk to him about my feelings that are similar to those that I\u2019m writing down now. It\u2019s just frustrating because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m feeling which makes it hard to tell him what I\u2019m feeling which makes it super hard to talk about it and feel better. Why is it that I feel completely numb about this at times? At this very moment, the thought of me breaking up with him is just not an event that realistically can happen. Doing so would be self sabotage, even though at times I feel like I\u2019ll be perfectly okay without him. Sometimes I think it would be super okay if he were to break up with me. I don\u2019t really know how to explain that. But it would be completely out of my control. It wouldn\u2019t be me fucking up this thing that we have and potentially making a mistake and missing him in the future and feeling like I could\u2019ve done something differently. It would be him breaking up with me, me missing him, and not being able to do anything about it cause it wasn\u2019t my call. On the other hand, there are times where I believe that I\u2019ll be absolutely devastated if he were to break up with me. This frustrates me the most. It\u2019s not fair for me to feel so strongly about him one day and then completely lose that feeling the next day. There are things I know I should do but can\u2019t do. I need to learn to love myself. I need to stop worrying about how others perceive me. I need to stop comparing myself to others. Not only do I already know that I have things to work on, he has told me the exact same things, confirming exactly what I was thinking. I don\u2019t know what the first step is. It\u2019s hard. And I\u2019ll be discouraged if everything\u2019s still not perfect by the time I\u2019ve learned to love myself and all those other things. I also need to stop striving for absolute perfection. I care too much. I don\u2019t know what to do about that. It\u2019s hard to stop caring. What\u2019s even more frustrating is the fact that I really don\u2019t have anything to complain about. This is a good thing! The bad thing is that I\u2019m not feeling alright despite being in a really good spot right now. I love my friends. I love my family. I love my boyfriend. Genuinely. Which is why I think this is a me problem. And I\u2019ve already listed why it is a me problem. And I just don\u2019t know how to fix those me problems even though I know exactly what they are. I don\u2019t really know what to do about this feeling. I\u2019m really glad I typed out as much as I can",

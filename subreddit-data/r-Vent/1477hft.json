    "postText": "Some background: There's this company me and my mom buy collectable bracelets from, that feature art and messages, and made from recycled plastics. Some are more rare than others due to how many are made.\n\n  \nFriday, we went to garage sales around town. My brother and I found some of these bracelets at one, and I was really excited because they were these special ones that aren't sold anymore. My mom had stayed in the car. So I was nice and texted my mom since I know she loves them too.\n\nWe continue looking at them and my mom comes over excited as well. I kept them on the table since we were all looking because it would be difficult for us if I'm holding all of them.\n\nShe takes all of them. ALL OF THEM.\n\nI kept saying that's not fair I wanted some, I saw them first, but she said \"Well you should've picked them up.\" Basically \"oh well I want them all\". I was letting her get a look at them! It's easier for us to look at them on the table!\n\nShe only lets me have one because it was a duplicate, otherwise my arguments fell on deaf ears. She didn't care, she bought them all for herself.\n\nEven when we got home, I offered to pay her back a higher price for a couple and got mad when I pushed. She says \"the smalls is all I can wear that's not fair!\" She hasn't even worn them since! She even posted in an online group for the bracelets about how she got them and it hurt even more. \"I got them all thanks to my daughter.\" \"I couldn't help but take them all!\" \"The price was a steal I couldn't believe I got them this cheap.\" I actually cried because it was just rubbing it in my face.\n\nIt's just now hit me hurtful it is. I was being kind and she was selfish. It's like I was nice and then she spit in my face. Am I crazy or was this really fucking rude?? She still doesn't care and hasn't noticed my change of mood. I'm tired of being nice. :(",

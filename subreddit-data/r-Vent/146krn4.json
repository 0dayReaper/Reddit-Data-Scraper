    "postText": "\nI don\u2019t know how to explain it. We got in a fight about screen time. With him thinking I was on my phone the whole day. Which doesn\u2019t really matter. He took my phone and just started scrolling through my things. He barely ever does that. So it\u2019s not like I thought I was hiding anything. In my eyes worst he would find would be like a pride flag or something. But he scrolled to 2020. Saw porn from when I was in some edgy discord server. And he proceeded to shame me. Not really yell but shame me for it. I didn\u2019t really see the problem. But he talked to me like a murdered someone. Like I had committed a hate crime or something. Like I was a slut over it. Over something I totally forgot about. He compared it to drinking and smoking. It wasn\u2019t me either. It was some cringe anime porn from 2020. But for the last 3 days after it happened. I\u2019ve felt gross. I haven\u2019t felt like this since I\u2019ve been SA\u2019d. I\u2019ve taken showers. Cried over it. And tried to forget about it. I looked at myself in the mirror and gagged. I feel terrible. It\u2019s been the only thing on my mind and it\u2019s stressing me out. I\u2019m insanely hyper sexual from my multiple SAs. But I genuinely feel like shit. Like I really did do something seriously wrong. Like I deserve jail time. And now he\u2019s talking to me like a baby every time I\u2019m on my phone. Like I\u2019m on my phone and his mind thinks it\u2019s porn. Like yes I\u2019m watching porn in the grocery store.He won\u2019t stop laughing at me over it afterwards. I hinted I want him to stop. He won\u2019t. It\u2019s limiting my ability to actually work on things. I wouldn\u2019t see myself ever on my life crying over anime porn. But here I am. I feel like a loser. I feel gross. \n\n(For a bit of background information. My father doesn\u2019t know about the SA. He knows I\u2019ve been groomed around twice. One on video when I was 6-7. So I\u2019ve matured way faster. Which is good and bad. He\u2019s never had a pregnancy scare or sex scare or anything like that ever from me. So that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. Because other then that, I\u2019m a great person. I follow the rules. I\u2019ve got good grades. Never had a boyfriend. Nothing.)",

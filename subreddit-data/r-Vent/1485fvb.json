    "postText": "Fuck. So I\u2019m 17 and I know it\u2019s not really a huge deal but damn does it kinda suck. I\u2019m an engineering intern at a company that is incredibly short staffed in the engineering department (should be 3 full time engineers + intern but it\u2019s just me and one other engineer) I\u2019ve been here since February as a part timer, but now Im going full time 8-5 and Im just a bit stressed, especially since there is like 5+ jobs on my desk that needed out weeks ago and 20 more that need out soon. I know logically, can\u2019t blame me for late shit because up until this point I\u2019ve only been there 4 hours a day and Im still in fucking highschool but damn does it just stress me out. I just wish they would hire someone else but no, stuck with this fucking skeleton crew. The building itself also fucking sucks because AC doesn\u2019t function (was literally 85\u00b0F in there last week with 98\u00b0F weather outside) and it\u2019s infested with wasps and I am allergic to those mfs so that\u2019s just wonderful. All the people are pretty nice and I have recently gotten a bit of a raise which is cool, but still just overall stress of change and work.",

    "postText": "I'm someone who's constantly overthinking things, and i have to get some of those things off my mind or else i'd be constantly having to think about every little thing.\n\nSo when i have an appointment a few months later i'll write it down in google calendar, inputing that i want to be reminded multiple times.\n\nBut sometimes it just .. doesn't ? Idk how it works, sometimes it'll remind me normally, sometimes it'll even keep reminding me \"you have an appointment scheduled\" when i had this appointment a few days ago and checked the \"done\" box, and sometimes it'll just completely forget to remind me ?\n\nToday i had a REALLY important appointment, because it's a very specific doctor that you need to appoint a few months in advance. I remember specifically writing down to remind me multiple times per day, for a few days and it absolutely didn't ! I even looked into my calendar, on today and it was still here with the reminder option. \n\nIt just feels like the app is completely botched and will sometimes skip over things that i needed or repeat things that i do not care about.",

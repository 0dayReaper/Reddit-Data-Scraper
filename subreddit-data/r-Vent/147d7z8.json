    "postText": "Like, I'm a 23yo dude with a lot of male and female friends.\n\nAnd i get a few compliments from both sides but they don't really mean much. I don't know if it's the same feeling that girls that get complimented a lot feel.\n\nLike, most of my lady friends are past romantic interests i had that didn't work, but we kept friendship, a few are just gaming buddies.\n\nYou may call it Friendzone, but well, from the point it didn't work out, it didn't matter much if we were to go separate ways or keep friends, but i take it as a good thing that they wanted to keep me around.\n\nAnyway, like i said, the eventual compliment feels \"fake\" or \"forced\" due to being friends already.\n\nWhen i think of compliments i think about 2 instances of my life where they felt genuine.\n\nWhen i was 10, in school, an older girl stopped me in the corridor and said: \"hey, your eyes are beautiful\". And that was my \"only compliment\" until last year.\n\nLast year, i was doing my internship to graduate in college and there was this older lady on my work. One day we were getting to work together, both of us and our boss (lady), and she said: \"oh i have a nephew just his age\", and my boss said \"ohh is he handsome? Present him to me\" and the lady said: \"yes! Very handsome, just like Isaac\". My boss's face looked like she had licked the most sour lemon in the world. While the lady smiled to me.\n\nand she would always smile to me, and greet only me out of everyone in the work, and call me handsome. To which i would respond by melting completely and acting like an ameba. (On the inside, on the outside i would just get really red and have a smile from ear to ear).\n\nShe was at the same time very giggly and girly and like WOOHOO, and professional and mature. So i never figured out her age. She could've been anything from late 20's to late 40's. I assume she was mid thirties.\n\nBeing completely honest. I was ready to marry her even if she was double my age.\n\n I still think of her, we both got fired almost at the same time a few days later.\n\nSo, anyway, all i typed was like to say that these 2 compliments, were the ones that felt sincere. And not like a \"hey gotta hype my friend up\"\n\nAnd these friend compliments really feel like they are originated from \"pity\".",

            "comment": "I think that it is very sad that boys don't get complimented as openly as girls. I think everyone should get to hear about their positive qualities from time to time.\n\nOne thing I have noticed is that people tend to assume their received compliments are out of pity if they perceive themselves as failing to meet the beauty standards upheld by their culture.\n\nBut as an individual I have to say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When I compliment someone on their appearance I truly do find that aspect of them to be beautiful. If I tell someone they are pretty, they might think I am lying because they are overweight. But I don't care about their weight, I am complimenting their striking facial features or contagious smile. If I say someone has beautiful eyes, they may think to themselves that brown is a boring color. But *I* love brown eyes and find them to be just as diverse as blue or green or hazel. \n\nAnd as for you, I have to assume that your friends have had more time to notice the parts of you that are truly beautiful than a stranger would. They don't keep you around out of pity. They spend time with you because you have a quality that they themselves find beautiful, even if they don't voice it. So I would take the affection everyday people have for you as a compliment in and of itself.\n\nAnd try not to discount the seemingly \"fake\" praise. Keep in mind that everyone is different, and whatever beauty standard is being pushed is not representative of what every person finds beautiful. I promise that to many, many, people out there in the world, your handsomeness is not up for debate.",

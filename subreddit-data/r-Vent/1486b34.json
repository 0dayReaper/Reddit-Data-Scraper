    "postText": "Is it normal for a man to actively pray, and actually push, for the downfall of the woman that birthed his kids? Kids he claims to \"love\" and \"want the best for\" ....\n\nBut at the same time, he's telling the woman, the mother those kids adore and need, that he wishes she'd kill herself, and has made the decision for those kids too young to make their own, that they do not need her.\n\nMe. That woman is me. Yall... I am in hysterics. I can't see, touch, or hear my babies... I can't tell them that I love them, I want them, I have not disappeared, and I AM coming back for them.\n\nThe last time I saw them, our visit was too brief.. they cried when I was pushed to leave against my will, wondering why I had to go, where was I going, and why can't I take them with me... I can honestly say that's the most pain I've ever felt. To look them in their little faces and have to say that you don't know... then having to turn around and walk away, hearing them cry for you. \n\nThis is hell.",

No visitation. \n\nLegally. If you're a male getting accused you are guilty before proven innocent.",

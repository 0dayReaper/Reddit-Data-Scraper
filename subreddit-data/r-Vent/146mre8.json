    "postText": "\nBefore anyone comes at me, let me explain. I am a male, I was born a male; always have been, always will be. The thing is, I\u2019ve spent my entire life comparing myself to the men closest to me in my life, meaning my family and my closest friends. Let\u2019s start with my family. The men in my family are your stereotypical \u201cstupid husband in movies\u201d, all they care about is food and sports, video games and women. That\u2019s it. If you ask them if they\u2019re stressing and worrying, they say no. If they\u2019re going somewhere, they\u2019ll go with 2 shirts and 2 underwear\u2019s max, if they\u2019re going out to eat, they\u2019ll be fine with whatever. They\u2019ll be outside and go workout and come back sweaty and take a 5 minute shower and toss all their clothes together in the machine. They go months without changing their bedsheets or washing their blankets or cleaning their cars or cell phones or anything. They stuff their faces with cookies for breakfast, a hot dog for lunch and a soda or two for dinner. They haven\u2019t been to the doctor in months, maybe once a year, and the dentist maybe once a year too. They\u2019ll take the trash out and come back and continue playing games. Something traumatic will happen and everyone will be worrying and 3 hours later they\u2019ll say \u201chuh, wait what happened, I didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201dthey\u2019ll hang out with their friends and come back and forget to even ask their friends where their friend works or how their family is doing. When it\u2019s time to go out, they\u2019ll grab a random shirt to wear, take a quick poop, and ruffle their hair and step outside and leave. They\u2019ll be staring off into the distance, not saying anything and if you ask them what\u2019s wrong they\u2019ll say \u201cjust thinking about that basket that was scored last month\u201d No fears, no worries, no insecurities, N O T H I N G. No planning, no preparation, not a thought behind those eyes. No opinions, no gossip, no awareness of the world or anything. Then there\u2019s me. Im the polar opposite. I have many fears and many worries. I suffer from multiple mental health disorders which cause me to worry nonstop. If I\u2019m going somewhere, I HAVE to be prepared. Traveling? I\u2019ll take almost my whole closet. You never know how cold or warm it\u2019ll be. I\u2019ll take Clorox wipes and hand sanitizer and bandaids and chapstick and pain killers and cold and flu medicine too. You never know what happens. If I\u2019m going out to eat, I need to know where we are going NOW, so I can google the menu beforehand and decide on what I want. If I come back sweaty from the gym I need to take a precise shower so I\u2019m very clean and then I do laundry by separating whites and colors. I also wash and change all my bedding and blankets and pillows weekly and so on. Also, I don\u2019t like sports and I eat calculated and work out,making sure to get all my vitamins minerals and nutrients daily.  I also get constant checkups and doctor/dentist visits and so on. I take the trash out and come back and wash my hands well before resuming my video game. I sit and worry about so many things in my life. I get ready so well before going out, making myself extra spotless with ironed clothes and pressed shirts with cologne.  My point being, they\u2019re the stereotypical \u201cstupid male\u201d in movies that just sits on the couch and eats chips and beer and watches football. The fact of the matter is, I really wish I was like them. They barely go through emotions, whereas me, I feel everything so deeply. I think, I worry, I overthink, I stay awake at night, i have fears and insecurities and I can\u2019t seem to shake them. Despite me having so much control over my entire life, by meticulously doing things, the more I do, the more I worry. They seem so much more happier and I used to think it was a classic case of \u201cgrass is greener on the other side\u201d but as the years have passed , their lives truly are happy. My entire life I\u2019ve tried being as carefree as them but I can\u2019t. They also have flawless social skills and are very likable whereas me with my mental health issues causes me to be awkward and dumb in public settings. Does anyone else feel this way? How are my fellow men so carefree all the time? Why can\u2019t I be like that?",

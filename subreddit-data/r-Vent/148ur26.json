    "postText": "I love this man so so so much\u2026HOWEVER, he is driving me up a fkn wall right now. He is recently quitting marijuana(he has smoked for years) I genuinely don\u2019t think he\u2019s been sober for a very very long time outside of roughly a month. Anyway, he is getting so mad and dramatic over small shit. Ex: I forgot to refill the sodas, I picked up pepto for his nausea and apparently that won\u2019t work, I didn\u2019t know he wanted me to take our son out the bathroom after he told him to follow him with unrealistic expectations. I know right now he needs grace but holy shit we are only on day 2 and I\u2019m so irritated with him. I love him and I want to be here for him but I have CPTSD and he is continually triggering me and I keep snapping back today. Idk just pray, send positive vibes, do a dance or something for me cause it\u2019s gonna be ROUGHHHHHHH. \n\n\nTD;LR: f20/m27-3 year relationship(roughly) send help",

Aside from the withdrawals, just pay attention. You guys' dynamic may change bc he has to face things head on without the smoking and it will prove difficult. Just keep supporting him quitting this habit and all will go well. Good luck.",

Personally, I'm in the same boat, but I'm not giving it up.\n\nIts going to be difficult for him to find a new balance. Weed could have been his coping mechanism from the smallest inconvenience to dealing with mental health.\nThe fact he's doing it is amazing.\n\nAnyway, just support him dude. He'll be leveled out in a few months because his natural levels have to raise back up. It won't be weeks, people will say weeks but if he's a frequent smoker like me its going to be a few months until he's even ok.\nHis irritability maybe be gone sooner but there's other issues too like insomnia and mood swings. Just remember he's getting \"sober\" and you'll get a completely new person to spend another 3 years with, that's the best part.",

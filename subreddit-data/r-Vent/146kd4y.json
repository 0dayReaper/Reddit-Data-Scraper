    "postText": "I'm worried that I'll be forever alone because of how disabling my chronic pain is at times. I've had to leave parties in the middle, some days I can't go through a whole school day, and I just wonder sometimes, will anyone ever be able to deal with that? My own friends find it hard, as it probably is, because they have to do so many things alone, and I can't always be there for them because of my pain. It's honestly really stressing me out. I feel so guilty that I'm preventing my friends from having fun, even though ik I can't do anything about it. In a way, I feel like if people get close to me they have to share the burden of my pain, which hurts them, and that makes me feel like I'm better off alone.",

I genuinely believed no one would ever want to be my friend, let alone a partner because of my issues. \nI got lucky, truly lucky. My husband (been together 8 years, married for 4), accepts all of me. My good days and bad days. \nI ended up in the ER for 5 days when we were just married. He not only stood by me, but slept on the floor using his shoe as a pillow \ud83d\ude05 he\u2019s proud of that! \nSince the beginning he has stood by me. Did medicine runs, made me feel beautiful on my ugly days, and is always so patient and understanding. \nI suffered severe migraines since I was 15. We met when I was 23. \nThe 8 years before we met, I lost countless friends and had very bad, heartbreaking relationships. \nI would go through all the pain and suffering again if it meant i would be with my husband. \nI genuinely hope your life is full of supportive friends, family, and partners. You deserve to be loved and to give love.",

            "comment": "I used to feel this way as well i have several chronic illnesses and the older i get the more it seems to be an issue with certain friends. So I just started hanging out more with my friends who are accommodating and don\u2019t make me feel bad for having to leave an event early or having a day where I don\u2019t have to do a whole lot physically. My partner is also a godsend and is constantly making sure that i\u2019m up for any plans we have, if i\u2019ve taken my medication, rubbing my sore muscles. I never ever knew I would be in such a stable and healthy relationship, I had a tendency of leaving people before they got \u201ctired\u201d of my mental and physical illnesses and even dated a few people who would use my illnesses against me when they were angry. So for a while I felt alienated and like I was going to be forever alone. But I promise that there are plenty of good hearted people that are not going to have a single issue with your chronic pain other than maybe feeling terrible about you having to be in so much pain all of the time. You\u2019re deserving of love regardless of your mental and physical condition and it\u2019s completely possible for you to have that i promise!",

    "postText": "i know that i won\u2019t , but growing up my parents NEVER let me go anywhere with anyone except for my aunt and uncle. Growing up in an indian culture obviously women aren\u2019t very much allowed to leave the house. Before we moved to the US i never really went anywhere except school and maybe some relatives house here and there. Even after we moved to the states, my parents wouldn\u2019t let me go places because they were scared that it\u2019s a new country and i didn\u2019t know very much english and this nd that. They didn\u2019t care about the fact that I understood a lot because i\u2019m literally a gifted student, so catching up on american english didn\u2019t take long for me, maybe 2ish years? Nothing i did proved to them that i was capable enough to go outside, even going OUTSIDE for a WALK was not allowed. idk why they did that. my mom has always beeen super , SUPER overprotective over me. I am a miracle baby i wasn\u2019t supposed to make it or they said if my mom gives birth to me i would come out with severe deformities because my mom had huge tumors in her stomach when she was pregnant w me and i wasn\u2019t getting enough air / nutrients or whatever. Thankfully I jus came out with autism and adhd with no physical issues. I am what people would say conventionally attractive. that\u2019s also part of the reason my mom was so overprotective too. I was a really white baby when i was born and indians loveeeee lightskin people so she was extra worried i would get snatched or something. even today i look more hispanic or latina then indian , people are shocked to hear that i\u2019m south asian or indian at all. anyways im getting off topic, point is because of the fact that they never let me go places gives me anxiety to go outside now. basically i wasn\u2019t allowed to go places before i turned 18 and i turned 19 in april so i\u2019ve only had regular freedom for about two years. Literally before that i wasn\u2019t even allowed to go to to the movies w my friends , at their houses omg literally my old best friend used to live in the SAME apartment complex, her apartment was literally a couple steps away like deadass , plus her parents were LESBIANS and the only \u201cman\u201d in the house was my besties little brother who was literally a freaking kid but nooo , my mom would freak out even if i went to the dang restroom and she would come in my room and not see me and start yelling and get scared. My mom never gave me my own room either. She always made me share a room w her and to this day she has been sharing a room w me, She has zero concept of privacy. I\u2019ve always said this and i\u2019ll say it again, my mother cannot accept the fact that im a human being and not her little doll she can still play with. I love her, She has done everything for me but also she taught me absolutely nothing about how be a productive human. I didn\u2019t know how to make my fricking bed until i went to nursing school. before u guys start saying i should\u2019ve learned everything by myself , my parents only wanted me to focus on school and that\u2019s it. they never let me do anything that wasn\u2019t school related. because of all this now our relationship is sooooo strained and as much as i love her , i also dislike her for making things this way. Like u can\u2019t keep a person so sheltered. did she think that only being good academically would get everything done for me? Like did she think another person will always take care of me just because i\u2019m academically gifted? another person is always gonna make my bed and make my food and fold my clothes just because i got all A pluses ? to this day i\u2019m anxious about going anywhere even if it\u2019s the corner store down the street. Last year was the first time i\u2019ve never went to a party that wasn\u2019t a cultural or family event. just a regular hs party. it was so surreal for me even tho it\u2019s regular for everybody else. and yes i been in therapy multiple times. I always get trash therapists because of my area.  they never account in my feelings and they always give me the \u201cjust forget about it and be happy\u201d vibes like if it was that easy i would\u2019ve done it years ago. i still cancel on friends , cancel on events and even interviews and stuff because of that inside feeling that i\u2019m gonna get yelled at or they\u2019re gonna be mad at me for going out even tho my mom doesn\u2019t really say anything about me going out anymore because she knows she can\u2019t legally stop me. even then i barely go outside. Idk how i can fix this or if i can ever fix this. but i just wanted to talk to someone about this cuhz my irls don\u2019t seem to fully understand. im sorry anyways",

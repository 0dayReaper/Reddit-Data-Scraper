    "postText": "Well I do have a lot more reasons but I would say BTS plays a huge huge part in this.\nShe talks about BTS so fucking much I just could not fucking take it and I couldn't even fake it anymore.\nEvery time we talked either alone or with other people she would bring fucking BTS into our talk even if I was sharing my emotions she would fucking be like \"JImIn wrOTe SOmThiNg abOUt ThaT oN TwiTtEr\" SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY.\nEvery time I tried to ask her to talk about something other than fucking BTS she would get quiet and mad, WELL SORRY every fucking time I went to see her and wanted to talk or do something fun she would just get her laptop out and we would sit without talking and watch BTS stuff.\nIt was her entire fucking personality, BTS and being in a gay relationship which she does not have anymore so I guess it's just BTS now.\nAnd I never told her a fucking thing when breaking up with her so to not hurt her but I wish I fucking did.\nAnd I don't want to fucking hear about BTS or jimin or suga or whatever the fuck the names are ever again",

Eventually she came out of her depression and looks back on it with a bit of cringe. She's still a fan, but not like that. She's my sister and my blood though.

My ex gf was also insanely passionate to the point of worshiping some boyband (forgot the name) but she eventually grew out of it. My ex was some loner in school and was always depressed. My guess is that these boy bands elevate their happiness and it becomes worse when they see other girls (like their friends, cousins etc) doing the same. I don't know if these kpop boy bands prey on the insecurities of developing females because there are so many boybands  insofar they're becoming so generic (same hairstyle, dance, feminine appearance etc). However, I think it really becomes a problem when these young girls or even older women begin to  idolize  them and putting them first over anything real (jobs, relationships, family etc).\n\nSo.. Is it annoying to deal with? Absolutely. Should you put up with it? It depends..like if she grows out of it. Though (based on my experience) i wouldn't put up with that garbage.",

That will serve you well.\n\nYou don't have to send the message, but if you do just know that doesn't mean you have to send or reply with any more messages after that.\n\nSorry you're going through this.

My two best friends were just like this in 9th grade, where they both were in the same class, but I was in another. EVERYTIME we met up during lunch break or a PE class, they ould go ON and ON about bts, how hot Taehyung is, how they hoped Jungkook and Taehyung were gay and in love, AND SO MANY STUFF. They never shut up when I told them I'd had enough. They didn't even listen when another of our friends told them to suck it up and talk to me about stuff I'm also interested in. They don't do that anymore tho (whew), they're still fans but that ultra obsessiveness of living and breathing bts was a 14 year old's phase I guess. We have a strict rule among us not to talk too much about bts when I'm there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I still never let them live it down though.)",

Their fashion, their body language, their laugh, the people they talk to. Everything is about their obsession over kpop.\n\n The reason I stared listening to kpop was because it brought comfort by it sounding like brainless happy and that's about it. Don't talk about it, don't share it, just listening to it for support. \n\nHope your ex realizes how her behaviour is having an influence on the people around her and does something about it.",

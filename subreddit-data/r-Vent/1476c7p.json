    "postText": "I (19F) had a boyfriend for three years. Those 3 years were terrible for me. He constantly cheated on me and the first time I found out was 2 months into the relationship when I had gotten home from being stranded in another state's hospital after a car accident where I received severe head trauma and deep lacerations. There was a chance I could die, and he was flirting with numerous other girls. When I confronted him he got on his hands and knees and begged me and told me that what happened \"wasn't him\" and he could change. SPOILER: he never did. Once I took him back the first time the cycle had started. I would catch him, he would tell me he would delete everything and it'll never happen agin. I even went to the mental hospital for how bad he made my mental state. I will admit, I told him when I took him back that I was to check a notification if I wanted and he would have an open phone with no secrets. (The open phone was my therapists idea to rebuild trust). He never did. He would tell me he would and then get mad and yell and say I never said that whenever I brought it up. Now onto the situation at hand.  \nI broke up with him officially about 5 days ago because he was deleting messages. The entire day I broke up with him, he was texting my mother and was begging her to talk to me \"one final time.\" Finally, after getting tired of him texting my mother, I called him. On that call he begged me for forgiveness and said he could be better for me. I told him that I had heard all of that from him before and it was never the truth. That's when he told me he would do absolutely anything for a final chance and if this didn't work out, he'd leave me alone. I told him ONLY if, he deleted any remnants of every women he has ever cheated on me with. Including, pictures, messages, and any contact info, as well as erasing every women that he does not personally know off of snapchat. (he would always cheat with strangers so I \"couldn't find out\"). I also told him that the second snap he used to cheat had to be deleted in entirety and the open phone rule was still in play. Lastly, I told him that since he was the one asking for it, if he goes against anything I will be gone for my own mental wellbeing. Today is the day he is supposed to be showing me the phone so we can get back together. Just as I expected, he texted me today arguing that this is too hard and he shouldn't have to do this. He says I am the one who ruined the relationship because I am the one who left. He tells me that the only thing stopping us is my word and I should also have to give something up. The thing is, I do whatever I tell him to do. My phone is completely open and he is free to go on it at any time and check anything. The only difference is that I have nothing to delete. I admit, I made it hard but I also feel like it should be hard after everything he's done. He shouldn't just get to say he has changed and still get what he wants like all those times before. I just need advice. Am I crazy for making it hard? Does he deserve it?",

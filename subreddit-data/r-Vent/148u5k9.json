    "postText": "Backstory: Before I was born, my parents were living in a small town home. My mom told me this story years ago and I'm not really sure how the legal system with this works, but at some point, my grandparents stole my dad's credit card or something and bought some fancy furniture for their new house with it. My mom found out because the bank called her because they couldn't get through to my dad.\n\nMy grandparents excuse was \"Oh his credit will be back to normal in like five years\" blah blah blah and my mom had to buy our current house in her name only because my dad's credit was fucked up. \n\nThe last 18 years of my life, they have been on the brink of losing their fancy house and furniture. My grandfather works, and my narcissistic grandmother sits around all day watching Fox News (if that gives you a perspective on what she's like). \n\nSomehow they own two horses, but they're always asking for money. My uncle, my dad's younger brother, was usually the one to succumb and give them money even though he's poor, but now he's at risk of going to jail because he isn't paying child support (he and my aunt got divorced because he was cheating on her). \n\nSo he's living with my grandparents and I thought they were all poor. \n\nWell, for the last year, they've been saying they're going to \"get a lot of money\" at some point this year. It's been a running joke with my mom, aunt and I that they're delusional.\n\nThat brings us to today, when my mom told me they're allegedly buying two beach houses, one with a boat. I'm obviously like wtf because no way they have that kind of money. No, it doesn't end there. My dad got a new car literally yesterday and I found out from my mom today that they paid for the majority of it. \n\nAnd that is ALSO NOT ALL because before my brother left for basketball practice today, my dad told me they're apparently paying for the rest of my college education? \n\nI'm so confused because after years of begging for money, and after stealing from their own son 18 years ago, suddenly they have this buttload of money that they have been implying for the past YEAR they would get.\n\nMy mom's theory is that they have been replaced by alternate dimension grandmother and pop pop, my own theory is that they're a part of some Fox News-Republican-Donald Trump cult that has been loaning them money.\n\nEither way, this doesn't feel legal, and I know that Jesus H. Christ didn't descend from the heavens to bestow upon these selfish, hateful narcissists $100,000. \n\nI can't even comprehend as to what is happening.",

They have to want something in return.",

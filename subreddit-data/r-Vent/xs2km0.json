    "postText": "This is going to be long, but please bear with me.\n\nI (23f) am no longer in contact with my mom (Jane) because of years of abuse, manipulation, fear-mongering, and hatred.\n\nI was conceived through a one-night stand. Jane couldn\u2019t get in contact with the guy and so carried and raised me as a single mother until she met someone. And god did she let me know about it. She made sure to tell me how unwanted, unlovable and disgusting I was. She admitted to neglecting me as an infant and toddler and how she would essentially have screaming matches with me.\n\nWhen I was 5, she met William and they fell in love. They got married within a year and William adopted me after his twin sons (John and Oscar-16m) were born. I was 7. Their relationship moved very fast and I believe it caused a lot of turmoil. I truly believe the pregnancy was to trap William, but that\u2019s speculation and opening a whole can of worms. During the pregnancy, Jane would have tantrums about having twins. How she \u2018only wanted one\u2019 and how she\u2019d only love the first one that came out. This was a new side to her that William hadn\u2019t seen before and he shut it down quickly.\n\nWell, she kept her promise and only gave attention to Oscar. John was completely neglected by her other than to feed. She had intense PPD and that\u2019s not her fault, but what is is how she handled it. She refused to get help and claimed PPD/PPP is for \u2018insane\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 mothers.\n\nAt some point when the boys were a year or so old, she was admitted into hospital for having intense thoughts about hurting herself or others. She was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and PPP. She spent 5 months in hospital/a mental health facility. For those 5 months she was gone, I have never felt so much love from another person in my life. Bearing in mind, I was just 8. All I had known was yelling, and emotional abuse.\n\nWhen she got out, both sides of the family had a big sit down and told her their expectations. It was all doable; go to therapy, take her meds and they made her a list of emergency contacts who she could call if she was feeling it all a bit too much. She had a support system in place. But she didn\u2019t use it. We moved out when William got home and found me at age 11 trying to cook dinner for my brothers (except Jane had turned the gas and electric off as \u2018punishment\u2019). Jane had locked herself in the bathroom and wouldn\u2019t come out because John was upset (remember, she hates John). She had also thrown a ton of stuff around in a fit of rage because I said she probably shouldn\u2019t take Oscar to the shop if she can\u2019t walk straight. William packed our stuff up and we left for his mothers. Jane was NOT happy about that.\n\nWhen he found out she had thrown shit around and at me, he was furious. He filed for divorce the following Monday. The court gave him full custody with mandated visitations from Jane. I remember crying myself to sleep when I found that out. We moved out of grandma\u2019s house and into a nice flat were we seemed to get our life together. Other than the visitation, we were good.\n\nUntil William got a new job and we had to move across the city. This set Jane off, who up until this point, had been on mostly good behavior. We moved closer to William\u2019s sister and her family. They all knew about Jane (aunt was on the contact list) but we all tried to move forward. Things were good for a couple of years but then I turned 16.\n\nThe day after my 16th, I got a text from Jane telling me that she\u2019s moving out and that I need to pack up my stuff from my old room. I went (stupidly) and began putting things into piles. Jane just stood in the doorway and eventually began bawling her eyes out. She began apologizing for everything she had done and how she feels like a failure. This is when she told me about the emotional and verbal abuse she inflicted on me as an infant/toddler and how she blames herself for my numerous mental health issues. This was all leading up to her asking if I could ever forgive her. I said no. I said that she may feel guilty, but she\u2019s stuck in this cycle where she\u2019s abused the boys as well. She lost her fucking mind and kicked me out. It got a little physical between us and she ended up screaming that I\u2019m no longer her daughter and how she\u2019s \u2018disowning me\u2019. When I got home, I told William everything. He was furious too and went to her place and arrived back home hours later with our stuff. I don\u2019t know what went down and I don\u2019t want to. We filed a police report (I had scrapes and bruises) and her mandated visits were lifted.\n\nA weight had been lifted off my shoulders. It was like this black cloud of negativity had finally eased up. I felt so much happier. I began to focus on school and my family without dreading having to see her. We couldn\u2019t get a RO, but she kept her distance. She would send birthday and Christmas cards, but we never reciprocated.\n\nThe boys know a bit about what went down, but William was very frugal with what he told them. He said he didn\u2019t want to inflict unnecessary emotional damage onto them.\n\nThen, on their 16th, she shows up. Which was weird because she never shows up to anything. I kept my distance and stayed in the kitchen but I could still see and hear everything. I was shaking in fear and had to run to the bathroom at one point. She had bought them both Nintendo Switches.\n\nThey both opened her presents last and both quietly thanked her. There was no insults being thrown around, no one said \u2018let her go it won\u2019t make a difference\u2019. The atmosphere was stifling. In fact, it was Jane who yelled and insulted first. She called the twins \u2018ungrateful brats\u2019 and the second she stood up to yell, William and auntie began to push her outside. As she was being pushed, she points at the twins and yelled \u2018You\u2019re both fucking ungrateful, unlovable little cunts and my biggest regret is not aborting you when I had the chance.\u2019\n\nThe party was naturally, ruined at this point and the boys are both totally emotionally destroyed. William left at one point to go and talk to her because she had blocked William (the only one who has her number) but I don\u2019t know the specifics.\n\nIt's been a few weeks since the incident, and the boys are both destroyed. Oscar has become a recluse and John isn't eating. I'm furious.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for making this so long, I\u2019m just so mad, traumatized and upset by the whole thing.\n\nEDIT: Hi everyone! I'm just popping in to clarify some things that I've been receiving in my dms and questions in the crossposts (because yes, I do read them). \n\n1) I do have a reddit account but I only use it to post sims 4 content (kinda lame, I know) and I am only subscribed/following subs of games I play. My second year of uni has also been kicking my ass and so I haven't been online as much. I know her post got a lot of traction, but I didn't see it. Plus, it got deleted so it's not going to pop up on suggested sub posts Reddit is pushing.\n\n2)  I DID hear about my mother's post from the THT podcast, hence the weird timing. I know it seems a little coincidental, but I promise this is all real. \n\n3) I have ZERO ill will towards anyone who sympathized with my mother as they were going off her original post. I've gotten many people dm'ing me about it and I just wanted to say that I totally understand why anyone reading the original post would think 'what a shit family'. It did suck to read everyone siding with her, but there is literally no reason to be mad as that's all the info they had. \n\nObligatory 'thanks for the support' comment. I will be logging out now for my own sake. ",

Not much you can do about her, but you\u2019re already giving your baby bros exactly what they need. Love love love. I hope their pain eases and they realize that just because Jane birthed y\u2019all doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s your mom. A mom is a person whose love is warm and kind. Jane is definitely not capable of that kind of love. \n\nQuick clarifying question though, how did your mom make herself a victim for thousands of ppl? Did she post something?",

In that post, she says she doesn't regret what she says and no apology will ever get her to walk it back.",

I let them and their father bully me for years. call me all kinds of names. How they reject every present I ever bought them cause it wasn't brand new or super expensive, despite me having to go hungry sometimes to even afford what I could get them. I come to their father's house one day to say happy birthday, they ignore me. i tried to give them a hug, I got pushed away. Their father told me to stop annoying them on their 16th birthday \"for god's sake/\". I got them both Nintendo switches for their Birthday and i set my carefully wrapped present on the table and they opened it last. when they saw it they said \"really thats it?\" I looked confused and asked whats wrong? was it the color this time? or maybe they expected games too? \"No one fucking plays Nintendo you fucking dinosaur.\" they said, Dinosaur? \"You guys never text me, I didn't know what you wanted and i know you broke the one you shared so i got you both your own.\" i told them. They set the presents I had to starve myself for on the table and everyone went inside for the cake. I finally realized, they dont care, they really dont care. why it take me years to realize i dont know but i do know. I took the switches and headed for the door. their dad stopped me and in front of everyone said \"hey where are you going? your leaving your kids on their b-day?\" \"let her go, it wont make a difference.\" one of my boys said. everyone laugh, everyone fucking laughed. i started to tear up and my sons aunt told me to \"stop being a big baby\" and \"hold the phone for picures\" . I got angry and i yelled, in font of everyone. \"i hate you, I hate you all, Im tried of this family abusing me, using my trauma against me. making me feel fucking small because im not rich and spoiled. Ive done nothing but love this family. But because im 'built like a child' I can t sit with the adults. No one came to my birthday why should I be here? no one cares about me, but yall won't bat an eye if i fucking died would you?\" then i looked my boys dead in their eyes and said \"I hate you both two, i wish I never fucking had you.\" ran out to my car and left. I blocked them all. the next day I heard a knock on my door and saw my kids father. He begged me to come to his house and talk to our kids, he says they're \"soo sorry.\" yet ive never heard this come out their mouths, so im not interested. that was a 3 days ago, and every since he come's to my door and asks me to forgive them, but I wont, dont think i can\n\n\nsorry for any errors im kinda shaken up, their father left an hour ago so its still on my mind",

But instead she completely leaves you out. Because let's be real, that would indicate she's in the wrong somehow (basing this as if you never made you post). \n\nEven in her original post, she manages to sound neglectful as she skips between having custody/raising the twins but also claiming she left her kids with a 'physically abusive' parent (in turn, saving herself) but also doesn't understand how her kids ended up this way. Of course, now we know why, but her back and forth is troubling.",

                    "comment": "I've found that malignant narcissists *(especially when they happen to be mothers)* quite often fly under the radar for a number of reasons:\n\na) in both genders, extreme narcissism is still often misdiagnosed partly since it's still relatively novel but also because by the time someone with extreme narcissism reaches the therapist's office, their life is usually already falling apart. They may also have depression since those close to them have shunned them (e.g.: in OPs Mum's case) or anxiety due to stress and relationship issues, or attachment issues due to a failure to maintain intimate relationships etc., or all of the above. It's most commonly misdiagnosed as borderline personality disorder.\n\nb) in both genders, extreme narcissists are adept at manipulating others especially when the goal of that manipulation is preserving or augmenting their ego. For this reason a lot of extreme narcissists perform well in their careers and have an outwardly stable life. Even if they're forced to get therapy (they'd almost never seek it on their own) usually only therapists that are trained to identify extreme narcissism will have the skills required to accurately diagnose and potentially treat them, most will be fooled by their manipulation / victim playing mentality and end up going round in circles, i.e.: \"X seems to be an issue.\" \"It's not my fault it's Y's fault, I'm a victim.\" Rinse and repeat.\n\nc) with respect to female extreme narcissists, at least here in Europe, mothers and especially single mothers have far more rights than fathers both *de facto* and *de jure*. This is partly because there was a time when the state was trigger happy with rehoming vulnerable children and mistakes were made; now the pendulum has swung too far the other way to the point that vulnerable children are often left in awful home environments. Additionally, the law hasn't yet caught up with developments in psychology; Narcissistic Personality Disorder is still relatively new and we're still figuring out the best way to treat it (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is considered as one mechanism, although narcissists are highly resistant to admitting they have issues so it's not very effective).",

Now I\u2019m disgusted with her and wonder how it doesn\u2019t bother her to be such a cruel human being. But also, she\u2019s dumb asf for having three children just to hate and abuse them. a lot of people don\u2019t deserve to be parents and she\u2019s most definitely one of them. I\u2019m sorry she robbed you and your brothers of a good childhood. Y\u2019all didn\u2019t deserve that at all.",

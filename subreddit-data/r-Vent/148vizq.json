    "postText": "I've been trying to get a dozen kittens out of my life for weeks.\n\nToday I spent 3 hours driving around town BEGGING shelters/rescues to take a couple of them. They all said \"no room, sorry\"... the last one went like this...\n\nME: please take just a couple of them, I have 14 of them\n\nLADY: I have 147 of them\n\nME: but I have to feed them and I can't afford it\n\nLADY: (laughing) So do we, and we can't afford it either\n\nME: hmm, so you spend your own money, I guess\n\nLADY: yes we do\n\nME: difference is, I didn't CHOOSE to have someone dump strays on my property when I can't afford to take care of them... YOU don't have to work/volunteer here if you don't want to...\n\nLADY: (laughing AGAIN) yeah, yeah... look the kittens aren't our problem, we have no room\n\nME: ya know what? Fine... you're right, not your problem. Well, it's not mine either. I'll just do what the first guy did and dump them somewhere.\n\nLADY: you can't do that! They'll die!\n\nME: (LAUGHING) Not my problem!\n\nI walked out, and brought the kittens back home. Trying to stay calm, I emailed the FIVE people who asked about the kittens (from the Craigslist ad)... I had already responded to them A WEEK AGO, and they never answered back.\n\nTurns out, one of them fosters cats and agreed to take EIGHT kittens TODAY! I was THRILLED!\n\nHe said he'd come by after work... I suggested 5:30. He said fine, unless he had to work an extra hour, then it'd be 6:30. I said ok, let me know when you're on the way.\n\nAt 7pm I tried contacting him asking if he was still coming. No reply. Again at 7:30. No reply.\n\nIT IS NOW 8:45! He is not responding to any emails. I'm not mad at him (too much), I'm assuming (hoping) something at work interfered, but I'm so frustrated that I want to SCREAM!\n\nThanks for letting me vent",

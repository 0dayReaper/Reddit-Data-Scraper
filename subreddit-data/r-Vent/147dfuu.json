    "postText": "I don\u2019t know how to describe it, but something with me just feels distinctly wrong. I had issues with mental and physical issues, but this is a different feeling.\n\nI just feel like a visceral pile of tissues and other matter I don\u2019t feel like I am properly in my own consciousness. I\u2019ve felt isolated for the past month and I think this is the signal of a breaking point. A point that I should\u2019ve expected but I dread.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to fix it, I still feel scared and anxious anytime the idea is even brought up. I try my hardest to keep up with what\u2019s going on around me but I still feel out of place and out of mind. \n\nI feel like I reached a point of emotionally unavailable where I don\u2019t feel like a person and it\u2019s so confusing. I don\u2019t know how to fix myself, I am already judged and I don\u2019t know how much more I can take. \n\nI\u2019m stuck in a cycle of hating myself and blaming my own body/mind for everything and it is my fault for why I am like this, why I got abused, why I isolated myself, why people don\u2019t see me. I want it to stop, but I still am terrified of the idea and of doing it myself. \n\nI feel like most people have never seen me as a human, just a useless body unless it is for someone else\u2019s gain and I can\u2019t help but agree now.",

    "postText": "Ive been waiting for school to end to dedicate myself to art for the longest time and now that i'm free everything had to go wrong. My dad and my stepmom fought because of lack of communication on the first day of vacation, and now the tense silence has been filling the entire house since then. Now im scared my stepmom might leave. Ptsd has been hard to deal with because of that. My mom, aka my abuser who ruined my life and ripped away my childhood is trying to take me away for the 100h time. She still thinks i'm faking all of my mental illnesses to have an excuse to be \"lazy\" and shes convinced my dad is forcing me to stay with him, that hes the one who forced me to leave her forever. She thinks im better off with her EVEN after i told her what she made me go through in detail, but she still thinks its bullshit. My birthday is in 4 days also, but i dont plan on celebrating it. I just cant after spending my past few days crying all day. What did i ever do to deserve this? Ever since i was a kid ive been everyones punching bag and i never complained, i sacrificed myself even for adults and getting abused is what i get in exchange. Yet i still cant help it but be kind to everyone",

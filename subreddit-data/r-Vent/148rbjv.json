    "postText": "\r  \nI've never posted here before, but this time I'm loosing my mind and my heart is so broken I don't know what else to do..\r  \n\r  \nSo, I've been with my girl for almost 1 year now, she is a great person, such a strong and intelligent woman. She is very extroverted and I'm more calm, we always say we complement each other very well and have an awesome relationship. We get along so good, we are always laughing and cracking jokes, we always have a goot time and we are so loving to each other, we hold each other tight.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, lately I've been having some intense intrusive thoughts that I am not being enough for her, because she has told me in the past that I need to read her better and she is having to tell me what to do or how to treat her a lot of the time, saying I'm kinda clueless and a bit too soft sometimes. I've really been working on this.\r  \n\r  \nWe communicate a lot of our insecurities, but since I started having these thoughts, I've been having a hard time dealing with them and not really been able to communicate. I always thought It'd be better if I just get over them myself and there is no point in being overly dramatic.\r  \n\r  \nWell, last night she was telling me about a rape fantasy she had, and said that if she had my body, she would do very hardcore things to her body. I don't know why, I just felt uncomfortable and started thinking maybe that was not my style and I am not giving her that kind of stuff although I really do try.\r  \n\r  \nAfter she was telling me this, I made the huge mistake to tell her maybe she wants someone else to do that and started making a drama out of it. Things escalated pretty quiclky as she said I was being too serious about everything and I should just joke around a little more. She said she loved me so much and she was so happy with me and she would never want anyone else, but I was in a really shitty mood and couldn't get out of the drama, she finally got tired when I told her I was probably not ready for a relationship cos I was too insecure, and she agreed, she said I probably needed someone more calm who wouldn't give me those kinds of feelings.\r  \n\r  \nThen I said I was so sad that things had ended that way and she took that as I breaking up with her over chat, which I basically did but that was not my intention at all, I swear. I was just typing things out of my desperation of losing her or feeling like shit, and now she has broken up with me and is so hurt by what I said, she is very upset about it and said she never wanted to break up but I was so insecure and selfish that I could never see all that she did for me and that she never asked me to change one bit.\r  \n\r  \nI feel like the shittiest person now, I was overly dramatic and hurt her, and I want to get her back.... She said we could speak things out but I can feel how she is deeply hurt and I am so sorry and sad, don't know what to do...\r  \n\r  \nI truly want to feel more confident and not have these kind of issues, which have happened before but this time it was just a huge deal. I feel ashamed of what I did and I guess I just wanted to vent. She asked me to give her space until we meet in a few days.... and she wants me to fight for her as she says, she wants me to show her I really care, and I do, I really do... I'm asking for a friend here, what would you guys do?",

She is avoiding me at any cost, I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\n\nYou are lucky that your girl want you to fight for her, don\u2019t f waste that oportunity tho!\n\nI hope you get better, be happy :)",

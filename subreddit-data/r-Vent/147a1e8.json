The highway is scary, but seeing as how you wrote this, your fine. \n\nThe first time I drove by self on the high way, I nearly got shoved into a wall by a semi cause I was sitting in its blind spot I think; missed my exit 3 times adding 20 minutes to the supposedly 10 min trip; and drove on the ridge things a couple of times. Don\u2019t give up cause you make a few mistakes. Youre fine and you can always avoid travelling on the highways at the very least.",

There's no need to be so hard on yourself unless you just want a reason to justify your self-hatred. You had a common experience that many drivers have had. There's nothing wrong with that, and it doesn't mean anything negative about you.\n\nDriving sucks. Even seasoned drivers have bad days and scary experiences. We don't just go extreme and decide we're never doing it again. Take it as slow as you can. You will never learn to be a better driver if you don't actually go through the motions to learn better driving.\n\nI'm Autistic and have ADHD and severe anxiety. I never thought that I should be behind the wheel. I would have to pull off the road/highway constantly to hyperventilate or break down. I've made my fair share of mistakes, including thinking I had enough space when I didn't. I've had someone follow me for 4 blocks just laying on the horn for something that *they* did wrong. I had plenty of days where I wanted to just throw away my keys.\n\nNow I've been driving for about 15 years and can even drive in harsh winter conditions. I still have my bad days, but if I don't drive there's no one to drive for me. You sound like you're still young, so that may not be an issue for you right now, but what about when it will be? Wouldn't you rather have more experience and confidence under your belt rather than be in a panicked situation because this was the last experience you had with driving?",

            "comment": "Hey OP, you did a great job going by yourself on  the highway for the first time! It take a lot of courage and balls just to be able to do that, especially by yourself! \n\nBut you need to take a chill pill OP. You are quite having a mental breakdown and you did not mess up. I was looking at your other comments and it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s your fault! The highway is a scary place to be in, especially being a new driver (if you are), and going by yourself. \n\nYou can\u2019t let this 1,2,3,4, how many other times you mess up get you. You gotta keep practicing and trying. If you give up, how are you gonna get better? How will you improve if you decide \u201cYou know what, I can\u2019t deal with it. I\u2019m done\u201d. You just gotta keep fighting through. You might then realize some of your driving skills aren\u2019t your fault and it could have been the fault of the other driver speeding. \n\nI have social anxiety and have agoraphobia. I got my license in 2021, but didn\u2019t start driving by myself somewhere that\u2019s 1 hour away to my school before until 2 months ago. I was terrified and still am. I always get anxious when I go out still and sometimes have panic attack. However, because I kept doing it, it\u2019s helped me practice more. Made me more confident in figuring out my driving skills and parking better. \n\nBefore this, I used to think everyone was out to get me. I thought everyone was judging me. 3 times I had accidentally almost gotten into a car crash because a car decided to merge in the same lane I was merging into at the same time! I thought it was my fault constantly and wanted to give up. They even honked at me and yelled! I rewatched the playback to see what was going on to fix my mistake in the future and realized it wasn\u2019t even my fault. They never had their blinkers on, because I always use my blinkers, and decided to just merge. \n\nYou\u2019re going to be fine OP. You will be able to get over driving and you will become a better driver and be more confident in yourself at it the more you practice and do it! Again, don\u2019t let these few incidents ruin your chances in ever driving again. \n\nBecause you even passed your drivers test, it means the instructor saw potential in you and knows you can do it! Good luck OP.",

So long as you're not wreckless, which I don't think you are, accept small mistakes you make and learn from them. No one's perfect.\n\nJust be mindful getting on the highway, keep a constant speed, give enough space between you and others when making a lane change, and you'll be fine. Oh also please don't coast in the passing lane if you're not using it to pass lol.",

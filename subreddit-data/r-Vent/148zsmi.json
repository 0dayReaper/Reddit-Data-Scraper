    "postText": "I just got the news the news today that one of my uncles died\u2026I wasn\u2019t close to him per say but I of course knew who he was and I know my nieces and aunt. Basically he died today on a motorcycle accident, he wasn\u2019t wearing a helmet and lost balance and the car behind him couldn\u2019t stop in time and so his head made contact with the cars wheel and you can probably put two and two together and\u2026yeah.\n\nIt\u2019s such a fucked up way to go. I hope it was painless and my uncle went instantly\u2026but just imagining the pain my niece feels, here I am in my bed about to sleep while my Aunt and nieces aren\u2019t going to sleep knowing their dad is gone and the fact they were told that his head was- fuck man! I feel so idk, like why?! Why specifically such a brutal death?! The fact those girls and that woman no longer have a dad/husband when they need him the most is just breaking me on the inside. Even tho I wasn\u2019t there I can only fucking see the image of the accident and it\u2019s fucking me up. \n\nOh god, I really hope it was instant, I\u2019m genuinely crying now but it\u2019s not even because I knew him like that, just the fact of how brutal his death was  and the people he left behind, a woman made a widow and 3 girls with no father now. I just don\u2019t why\u2026Honestly people hug your loved ones and appreciate them, Death can be so random and fucked.",

            "comment": "I'm so sorry for your loss. That's an awful loss to go through. My sister-in-law's step-dad passed in much the same way about a decade ago and I've still seen her have moments of grief, though they don't seem to make her cry (at least not in front of me) anymore. Time will heal the wound, though it'll still leave a scar that'll be there forever.\n\nNot to get too graphic, but if he didn't go instantly, he probably didn't feel anything due to the shock, if that's of any consolation. To him, it was probably only shocking for a few seconds and then - well, whatever awaits us all on the other side.",

    "postText": "I can\u2019t keep myself away and calm from the incident that happened to me yesterday. So, I was at an ATM machine, trying to withdraw money for my enrollment fee, when suddenly the machine said that they couldn\u2019t process my request as of the moment. At first, it wasn\u2019t big of a deal but moments later, they debited the amount to my account. I checked the machine but it did not dispensed any money. I rushed into the nearest bank office and they said that I have to wait 1-2 business days for them to credit it back. But I am so anxious that I can\u2019t tell my mom because I know she would react badly and blame it on me. I keep on checking my email for it, checking my bank account. I couldn\u2019t sleep well. I don\u2019t know what to do. I am currently thinking to find a loan that I can use but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right thing..",

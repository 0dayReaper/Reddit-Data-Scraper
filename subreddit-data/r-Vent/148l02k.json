    "postText": "I just moved but before I did I was in 2 different friend groups and had/have the best friend I have ever had and will have. Then I moved and I haven\u2019t met anyone or talked with people yet and I feel so alone, I smile at people when I walk by but that\u2019s as far as it goes. I miss my friends and the laughter and sleeping over and getting in trouble for doing numb things, now I sit on my empty living room floor scared. I just need 1 person, that\u2019s all. I need one person to see me. My best friend got her phone taken so I can\u2019t talk to her and even when I can she finally seems happy after some awful things happened to her and I don\u2019t want to bring her mood down, but I\u2019m struggling so much right now trying to recover from just having g some of the worst months of my life to them moving and I feel alone.",

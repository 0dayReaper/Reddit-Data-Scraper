    "postText": "So my wife guilts and shames me into demeaning sexual acts. I told her repeatedly I don\u2019t like certain things and she guilts me into it. She says \u201cyou not attracted to me?\u201d\u2019 \u201cYou must be cheating on me.\u201d \u201cSuch and so would do it\u201d and it\u2019s sick. I secretly take viagra and drink. I have never drank or done drugs in my life until two years ago. I pay all bills and food etc. last year my wife walked out on me and our children. She shaved all her hair and now dresses like a man and dates women. She says it\u2019s not cheating because their women but she \u201cworks\u201d a lot but never has money. She does not tale care of our kids, cook or clean. This house looks like a hoarder house if I go away. I\u2019m a disabled veteran with epilepsy, ptsd, and a right arm that is partially paralyzed. She has zero empathy for me. Today she told me her money is hers. Instead of getting our children things or paying any bill. She is going out with her girlfriend to Dallas. She is spending about a thousand dollars. She leaves for days at a time all the time. And when she is here she destroys the children by enabling and rewarding bad behavior and feeding them restaurant food and junk. She leaves mountains of shit diaper around my home and yard for me to clean up when I\u2019m not working. I stay up with the baby all night and work all morning. She destroyed any chance of me graduating college or starting a good career. She talks about me like I\u2019m just a random dude of the street. I don\u2019t know what to do. She is the ultimate narcissist. I had a stroke and seizure last month. She sleeps all day and lays and the bed and play on her phone all day. She basically married to her phone. I fell asleep for one hour. She woke me up and said \u201cI\u2019m looking for the remote.\u201d I asked \u201cdid you lift up the blanket to find it?\u201d Her reply was \u201c I didn\u2019t want to lift it up because you a light sleeper and would have woke you up\u201d at that moment I called her out on her bullshit. \u201cMake it make sense. You woke me up because you didn\u2019t want to wake me up?\u201d She was livid! She went on an hour long rant about how I\u2019m manipulating her and I\u2019m a narcissist. I told her I don\u2019t want to hear about her dating. She tells me almost every detail like to torture me the. Act like \u201coh if it bothers you just say something\u201d I\u2019m in a bad place mentally. I downloaded an app that lets you meet someone just to impregnate them because I want a child that has not been tainted by her. I\u2019m the \u201cbad guy\u201d and social pariah in my home. She made me get rid of all my friends and social media. So it\u2019s just me. No adult interaction. Being a servant, butler, sex on demand for her, her parent, the cook, the nanny, the punching bag\u2026.. help",

A strategy forward might need a mutual agreement, however find a shield to detach yourself from toxicity. Find ways to interact with other adults even if it means to just get yourself from the conundrum of emotions. \n\nWishing you the best of luck in finding a more constructive approach as life might be too short to be and stay upset most of the time(s).",

    "postText": "Me(f17) and my boyfriend(m17) have been together for 2 years, not actually we have broken up a lot of times but 2 years since we first got together. I don't know what to do.\n\nI don't know if I should stay with him or not. The main reason is he cannot trust me about anything. I have cheated before but I came clean and told the person when I was 15. I have never cheated on my current boyfriend and would never. I love him a lot and we have planned out a life together. I understand if he is cautious because of my past but he is more than cautious.\n\nFor example(this actually happened abt a week or two ago) he will blow things out of proportion. I am not saying what I did was not wrong but I don't feel it deserves this reaction. If I am wrong and being stupid please tell me. However at work I was talking to my coworker who knows I have a bf. She told me me and another guy at work would be cute together. I told her that was gross because he just turned 15 and I turn 18 in nov. She apologized and said she thought he turned 16 and that was the end of that. A little while later I remembered and told him about it. At the time he seemed annoyed at my coworker for saying that which is completely understandable but seemed fine and left. Afterwards he called me. He was extremely angry that I said he was way too young instead of saying I have a bf. He said this was implying I would if he was older. I explained that was not my intention I didn't say anything because my coworker already knew I had a bf and I had already said absolutely not so I didn't feel the need to reiterate that but in the future I would do so because I could tell this was bothering him. He said that I could not take it back and continued to be extremely angry and said things like \"have fun flirting with your coworkers\" and implying I was or would cheat on him, that I was ashamed of him, and that I did not care about him. He later got angrier when I said he had upset me and I didn't want to talk about it at the time(abt an hr later) and refused to stop texting me.\n\nHe acts like this a lot over small things such as me telling my manager I was upset because we were fighting(I had a meltdown at work) and I just don't know if I can deal with it anymore. I love him so much and I am aware that I am not perfect and that I make mistakes but I don't feel I deserve to be treated like this.\n\nI am scared and do not know what to do because we planned out this whole future together. I don't have a lot of friends anymore I'm pretty annoying and not very pretty. Even thought he is really mean when he is mad he is nice when not angry and is even ok with the weird parts of me. I fear that I will be all alone and no one will ever love me or even like me or treat me as well as he does. I don't even know if I'm ready for forever at this age but I'm scared to throw it all away. My friends and family dislike him but what if that's just because they see it from my perspective.\n\nIf we break up or take a break I know I will miss him terribly because he is an essential part of my life and I love him so much. But I hate to admit today was one of the best days I've had in a long time, and today was one of the very few days I didn't see him. I don't know what that means.i don't know if there is a correlation or not\n\nFor the last few months I have thought about this but convinced myself I was overthinking and that I love him and it's my fault because I'm the one messing up. I can't keep ignoring it though it gets worse and worse everytime we fight and I'm starting to wish I didn't exist anymore so I don't have to deal with it and horrible thoughts are coming back although I have not acted on them and im not planning to.\n\nI don't know what to think, do, or say. I need help, I feel all alone.",

But it\u2019s almost impossible to not be jealous.\n\nIt sounds like you both have a lot of self growth to go through.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn\u2019t even bring shit like that up with him. Because 1 it doesn\u2019t matter. And 2, it\u2019s just gonna upset him. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not defending the way he acted. He definitely overreacted. But you\u2019re both young dumb and full of cu- emotions.\n\nHe needs to work on his jealousy and trust issues. Staying together could be dangerous for both of your growth.",

Saying something along the lines of \u201cthings need to change between us. The situation we\u2019re in isn\u2019t healthy, and it doesn\u2019t make either of us happy. *id point out each others faults here.* so, if we aren\u2019t able to change it might be best to part ways for good.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that people don\u2019t like their faults being pointed out. So you have to remain calm the entire time and understand that you\u2019re going to upset him.",

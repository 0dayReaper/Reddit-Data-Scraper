    "postText": "Just to get to get to the point I have never been in love or even in a relationship. I\u2019ve dated very little after high school but that\u2019s the extent. I didn\u2019t really care for intimacy before I was 19 and now it\u2019s a small factor in my life. However, I want to know how to love someone. It keeps me up at night sometimes. I\u2019m aware relationships aren\u2019t always what they crack up to be and people always respond \u201cgood for you\u201d when I say I\u2019ve never been in one but I hate it. I\u2019ve tried all of the dating apps but never really clicked with anyone. Maybe I\u2019m just too picky? In terms of looks or personality I\u2019m pretty flexible, I more look for someone whom I mesh with well above anything. Life can be really lonely and I just want to share my time with someone who is worth it. I want to be able to relax with someone who wants me around, I can\u2019t even imagine what it\u2019s like. At my age it just feels wrong to be so inexperienced but I also don\u2019t want to force myself to love someone because that can have it\u2019s own risks. I could probably put more work towards it but I feel like I\u2019ve done all I can to find someone. I just haven\u2019t found the right person. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll happen someday but I just needed to let out my sadness to the void.\n\nAnyway that\u2019s my midnight silent cry, thanks for reading!",

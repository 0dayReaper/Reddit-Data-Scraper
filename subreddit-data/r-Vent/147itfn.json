    "postText": "Hi 18nb here and I just now realized I was being groomed by a wholly grown adult online friend when i was between the ages of 15 and 17. That and everyone else i knew online saw i was being groomed and decided to let it slide. Could the people who saw what was happening not have at least said something? They looked pretty ok with her treating 15yo me like an adult and letting me in adult spaces on the internet. Ig they\u2019re not obligated to help me, but why were they so ok with it? Like, they were literally watching her say and do some of the most ungodly shit to someone outwardly stating they were 15 years old and they didn\u2019t even question it despite them being the same people insisting they hate pedophiles and wouldn\u2019t let a minor anywhere near their nsfw content\nLike, I kinda knew at the time in a way?? I knew an adult doing that sort of thing with a 15yo is bad, but she acted like a friend. I\u2019m autistic so keeping friends around has always been hard, I was just happy to have someone around, grown adult on the internet showing me porn or not. I never questioned it, I just wanted her to stick around because I really liked her. Plus she would always ask permission before she would do something sexual anyway so I thought that I made it ok.\nIt, in fact, doesn\u2019t btw. I had zero fucking clue what I was getting myself into and now I\u2019m a mess. This whole thing just makes me feel embarrassed, stupid, and gross and it fucking sucks.",

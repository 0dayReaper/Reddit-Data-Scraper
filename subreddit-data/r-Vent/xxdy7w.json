    "postText": "The title is a bit misleading but it will make sense. We need to stop calling abusive siblings \u201cnormal sibling\u201d behaviour and call it what it is. Siblings can be abusive and it\u2019s worse because you can\u2019t get away, you have no choice because you rely on your parents so much. I understand that normal siblings do bicker and don\u2019t always get along, but when one is chasing the other with a knife or they wish death upon them then that isn\u2019t normal anymore. People can be victims to their siblings and it\u2019s awful when people make it seem so small and insignificant. Stop saying that it\u2019s normal because it\u2019s not, no one should have to suffer like that and then get no justice. It just isn\u2019t fair. And don\u2019t say that he does it because he\u2019s traumatized, I was too and now I\u2019m further traumatized by his abuse\n\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sorry to all the people that relate to this. I hope you heal and have a fabulous day",

I remember the first time max hit me when I told him I wanted to play a different game and he tried to make me play his game. I ran home crying and I told my grandparents and mom. They all comforted me and told me \u201cthat just means that he likes you!\u201d Even at 6 years old that didn\u2019t feel right. I didn\u2019t think physical violence meant love because when my dad would be violent with my mom she would cry too. So I ignored them and told max to never do that again or we won\u2019t be friends. He understood and never hurt me again. I would go over to his house and play trains. One day, his older brother (maybe 15 years old?) came in and saw that we were alone. We had to have been maybe 8? He started making fun of max for playing with a girl alone and made some vulgar comments that at the time I didn\u2019t understand. He then grabbed max and pushed him against the wall, and proceeded to punch him in the stomach. Then while max fell to the ground holding his stomach in, the brother kicked him in the head. I stood there in shock. Silent. He smiled at me and then walked out of the room. When I told my mom about this, she told me that sometimes brothers will fight and pick on each other and that it\u2019s normal for boys to rough house. I tried to explain he was bleeding but she shrugged it off. And it never sat right with me. And I remember thinking about it a lot for weeks. I remember seeing him with black eyes. Seeing him with bruises and cuts throughout our days of playing together. When we\u2019d play basketball and his brother took out the trash, he\u2019d shove him so hard in the gravel, that max would bash his face in the wall and his nose would break. I know his parents didn\u2019t do anything about it and wouldn\u2019t be surprised from the shouting I\u2019d hear that they were abusive too. To this day it makes my gut hurt. Years later when I visit my grandparents, he still lives at home and never ever leaves the house. They call him a sad messed up boy who never grew up. I always remind them that he was abused but my grandparents never understand. \n\nI nevvver have hurt my younger sister. My brother died when I was young and I guess that and the constant childhood abuse made me protective over her. But I still pray for max. I still cry for him. I wish I knew that. I tried to stay in touch but he doesn\u2019t socialize anymore. I wish I could help him.",

If I wanted to sit up front on the way to school for once instead of her boyfriend I was screamed at. If I breathed or looked in her direction I was screamed at. People at our school knew when we were there because we would roll up and she would slam her car door and scream at me in the parking lot. Once she even turned her headlights off while we were driving home one night, our road has a completely blind curve before getting to our house, no one would see us until the last second if anyone was coming. She sped up and started screaming how she was going to crash the car and swerve the car so only I would die.... this was not long after our grandma had died from a car accident. She sexually assaulted me in elementary school which is something I had repressed until college when additional trauma unlocked that gem for me. Even now as grown adults I don't like being touched by her, we don't hug or show affection. She acts really confused sometimes as to why we're not close, which is bizarre to me, and I know she's put in some effort by calling me since we don't live in the same state and including me in things like her wedding, I was the maid of honor. But I'm so traumatized and fucked up by all the screaming (which she still does once in a while to this day) that I just can't fully allow her to be in my life... it's sad but I don't know if it's something I can really get over. It's like being around her at all makes me uneasy because I never know if we're gonna have a good day or if she's going to be a huge bitch and be screaming at me and blaming me for every little thing that goes wrong in the day. I recently started opening up about all this trauma to my parents and they act like they hardly noticed her screaming for all those years, I think they blocked it all out.",

I asked him why and he said his older brother was so abusive and cruel to him whenever he would show any emotion growing up that even now as a 28 year old man he has a hard time unlearning to repress all his emotions. \n\nThat brother yells at their mom often, and is recently starting to recover from a debilitating alcohol and drug addiction that started in his early teens. \n\nHe currently has chosen not to have a relationship with that brother, but the lingering affects of growing up with him are still a part of my husband\u2019s personality.",

My brother chased my sisters and i with a sword once and we had to lock ourselves in the bathroom until our parents got home so he wouldn\u2019t hurt us. Thankfully, they got rid of his sword collection after that. \n\nMy little sister was also always bigger than me and she used to beat me up all the time and call me names/threaten me. She shoved my face in sand once and held me there so I couldn\u2019t breathe. One time I was making a YouTube video (right around the time YouTube was becoming a thing) and she ran up behind me and started beating me up and eventually shoved my face in the bed so I couldn\u2019t breathe and was hitting me. It went on until we were teenagers. I like to think it was just because we had an abusive father and she just thought it was normal. Don\u2019t talk to her much anymore, or my father at all. Don\u2019t talk to my brother really either besides holidays. People always just laugh and think it\u2019s normal, but it was and still is super traumatic for me",

We were neglected and he has bad adhd with anger problems..I remember often he would come at me and I would have to hold him on the floor till he calmed down. I do remember punching him one time. I also remember him chasing me through the house with a knife. Him and his friends stole my money a lot that I made working. One time I had had enough and I destroyed his room and spray painted his tv. His friends were at our house a lot because my mom was never home. One time I was trying to sleep after a midnight shift and I asked them all to leave the house. He kept saying no they didn't have to. I felt rage and through an ashtray at his head. His friends were also throwing my cat off the roof and I would try to fight them but they were stronger then me and would laugh. I moved to my grandmothers house after the cat went missing. I got some peace for a while but then my brother followed. He made my grandmother so angry and she was yelling all the time because of it. I finally moved at 18 and on the day I was moving I had 50$ set aside for food in my wallet. He stole that. I didn't talk to him for 2 years or let him anywhere near where I lived for longer. We did have some good years before I moved but last time I visited him he was having lots of issues with the mother of his kid and her dad..I was driving him 2 hour's to pick his kid. The main reason for the visit was to spend time with my nephew. immediately the grandfather and him started arguing and they almost got in a fight. He was acting crazy. I had to scream at him to get back in the car. I have a pretty normal life now and things like that don't happen anymore. Pretty much stopped when I moved out. Anyways I can't see myself visiting him again. Also he hardly sees his kid now. He makes excuses and I see him going to metal concerts. Im honestly sick of his shit. I tried to talk to him about getting help for his adhd so he can do what he needs to do and he won't. He said the medication made him a zombie. He only tried one medication as a kid. I got diagnosed at 19 and i tried many kinds but always went back to the first one I took. He won't listen to me about trying a new medication. I know it's hard to get ADHD treatment. I really wish he would get help.",

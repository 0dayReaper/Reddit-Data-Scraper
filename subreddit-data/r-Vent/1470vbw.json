    "postText": "So I (21 f) was best friends with K (19 f) and throughout the whole friendship I tried my absolute hardest to be accommodating to her and her triggers. Basically to keep from telling a long and complicated story she got REALLY clingy throughout the friendship so I figured it was best to try breaking away a bit (no longer putting my life on pause for her and just keeping busy). Now today I woke up to a snap from her Bf telling me \"watch yourself around my girl\". Now I haven't talked to her much, just small calls and messages here and there and everything seemed fine? Apparently she told all her friends I was toxic and used a \"prank\" that she had me pull against me (pretend yell at her in front of friends....stupid looking back I know). But basically I was really confused and when I asked how I was toxic so I can fix it all I got was \"are you so delusional that you can't even see what you did wrong?\" Like wtf am I supposed to do or say? But she messaged my bf saying she wants nothing to do with me. (the only reason my bf was messaging her was because he didn't like how I was being treated so he jumped into the fray).",

    "postText": "I met my best friend in fourth grade. We\u2019ve always been super close and have had our fair share of fights into adulthood but nothing like what just happened over this past weekend. Here\u2019s some backstory: About 3-4 months ago, we decided that her and her young toddler would come from CA to WA to move in with my fianc\u00e9 and I. We planned to get a house or an apartment together, and I was really excited. My fianc\u00e9 has always liked her and considered her a friend as well. We also both love kids so it wasn\u2019t a problem for us to be sharing space with a toddler. My friend, she was quite the troublemaker before she had her son. She would get in fights, abuse drugs and alcohol, went to jail, and overall was just pretty irresponsible and immature. From what I saw after she had her son, she seemed to really be turning around. She had a job and was staying out of trouble. I guess I just assumed that this same behavior and demeanor would stay consistent when she moved in with us. But it didn\u2019t. Within the first week of living with us, she met this guy on Tinder and asked if she could bring him to the house. I told her that I wasn\u2019t comfortable having a stranger over in my house(at this point, she was staying at my fianc\u00e9 and I\u2019s house until our lease expired, so we didn\u2019t have a lease together yet), but I told her that she could borrow my car so she could go to his house. I watched her son while she was gone, and she told me she wasn\u2019t going to be dr*nking that much. When she finally got back to my house, it was around 4AM and she told me \u201cI can\u2019t remember driving back here\u201d. She was incredibly dr*nk. Then, I found out that while my fianc\u00e9 and I were out of state visiting family for 2 nights, she had planned to have that same guy come over while we were gone. Even though I already told her I wasn\u2019t comfortable, she had planned to go behind my back. This is still all in a single week of her being with us. That made me feel very disrespected and I felt like I couldn\u2019t trust her after that. I wish I said something sooner but instead of confronting her I just bottled it up. Other than speaking to her about the dangers of dr*nk driving, I didn\u2019t really say anything else because I kind of just wanted to let things play out. I thought like well she hadn\u2019t had a night out in a long time, she won\u2019t do that again. But she did, and way worse this time. She told me that she was going out with that same guy again, but was taking her own car this time. She promised me that she wasn\u2019t going to drink, and that she\u2019d be home in 2 hours maximum. I was watching her son so knowing how long she\u2019d be gone for was important information for me to know. 2 hours go by, and she wasn\u2019t back yet. I texted her and she said \u201cI\u2019ll be back at 4am latest\u201d. Again, I didn\u2019t say anything and just let her do what she wanted. By 4am though I was extremely tired, I still hadn\u2019t slept because her son kept waking up throughout the night and I was too worried about her to sleep anyways. I don\u2019t hear from her until 5:00am when she finally says she is on her way back. Still haven\u2019t slept, I felt like a parent of a teenager waiting for them to come home safe. Then at 5:30, I get a text message photo of her car crashed on the side of the freeway. I immediately call her to ask her location so that I can pick her up, and I also asked her if she was drinking but she said no. She told me that her tire blew out on the freeway causing her to hit a semi truck. When I finally get to her location, (trigger warning, alcoholism), she was asleep on the curb outside the tow yard laying in puddles of her own vomit. The second I opened my car door I could smell the tequila. I had to violently shake her awake and put her in the backseat of my car. When we got back to my place the truth came out. She never planned on only being gone for 2 hours. The first thing she did when she left the house was go into safeway and buy a bottle of alcohol. Then, she went on Tinder to find 2 more guys to meet up with. Drove halfway down Wa state in the middle of the night, black out drunk to meet them. (TW) Said she fell asleep while driving home, which caused her to hit a semi truck which caused her tire to blow out. She didn\u2019t seem to realize how lucky she was to be alive, to have not hurt anyone, and to not be in jail. All of this and a mixture of other smaller things led my fianc\u00e9 and I to want her to leave. So we kicked her out. I paid for an uber for her to get to a hotel, and paid for one night in a hotel. She is paying for the remainder of her stay in the hotel until her mom comes to pick her up and take her and her son home. I strongly think she saw my fianc\u00e9 and I as people to watch her son so that she can go mess around again, and that\u2019s not what I wanted or expected at all. Although I am so hurt and angry, I will always love her and care for her and her son. I feel guilty about kicking her out, she kept telling me that she would never kick me out over a few mistakes. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with us and I\u2019m just heartbroken by all of this",

    "postText": "I feel I'm never good enough in college. I keep comparing myself with others and overthink. 3 semesters down I haven't really done anything productive than just getting decent GPAs. I feel nobody understands. Sometimes I doubt if I should continue college. I don't want to tell my parents. They've already done a lot for me and I don't want them to worry about me. My boyfriend's trying to help but nothing works. I get mad at myself for feeling this as many people have it worse.",

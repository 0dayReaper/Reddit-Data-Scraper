    "postText": "I don\u2019t even know where to start, and I\u2019m sorry if this post is all over the place, I just need to get this off my chest and any input is appreciated. But anyways, I\u2019ve been friends with a guy, let\u2019s call him Nathan (M/22), and he is diagnosed with ADHD and has been off his meds for two years ish to my knowledge. I also want to note that he has a therapist and has ever since he was a kid to my knowledge. We\u2019ve been friends since high-school, but I\u2019m starting to get concerned for him and how our friendship will end up eventually. He went to college around 2hrs away from the from group thinking that we\u2019d be able to visit him frequently, which we can\u2019t given the cost and the fact that we\u2019re going to college where we live while working. Overtime he began to hate his college because of this and has been coming down almost every other week to hangout, which is cool, but I don\u2019t expect him to given the cost and everything. I didn\u2019t even hold that against him that much since he made that choice at 18 and now he\u2019s 21 about to be 22.\n\n But he\u2019s gotten increasingly weird over the past 6 months. He decided to go abroad for a semester last minute with absolutely no planning, to the point where nearly all of the countries he applied to were filled. However, he chose to do this while in a relationship, which I was concerned about him being able to maintain while he\u2019s away since she\u2019s honestly a great catch and wouldn\u2019t want him to that, especially after seeing how emotionally abusive his ex was towards him. He then told me he\u2019s planning on having an open relationship with his GF while he\u2019s abroad, mainly so he can \u2018experiment with foreign women and she can get more experience\u2019, which were his words. I told him he has the freedom to make that choice, but I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea given that most open relationships don\u2019t work and you might risk loosing your long term relationship with her over a voluntary and unplanned study trip since she might feel isolated, and or persue someone else when you\u2019re away for months. He said that won\u2019t happen since he knows her. Anyways, they\u2019ve tried the open thing and he\u2019s been trying to find hookups and hasn\u2019t been able to find anything, and to my non shock, they broke up last week. My schedules been slammed this summer with a summer class and working full time and I just don\u2019t have the time to hangout with him as much rn, and now I feel like he wants me to drop everything to \u201ccomfort\u201d him after making a dumb decision imo. He\u2019s been texting me how hard the break up is for him rn, and I absolutely empathize with him, but I feel as though he\u2019s become increasingly self destructive and this behavior is starting to become a pattern where he doesn\u2019t realize what he has until he loses it in a way. He always talks about how much he wants to travel, and he does so very frequently, but it seems like his life revolves around it and then wants everyone to rework their schedules and lives to hangout with him once he comes back, and on top of that, he\u2019s been saying how much he hates our state and how he wants to leave, hoping that we could move with him or visit him frequently if we don\u2019t, when I can barely visit him during the school year as it is. I\u2019ve began to realize after hanging out with a new event group on Wednesdays that my friendship with him doesn\u2019t feel consistent and he\u2019s always in and out of my life, and everyone else\u2019s for that matter. Lastly, I\u2019ve been feeling that the new friend group just seems\u2026normal in comparison. We can just talk, hangout, and play games and stuff. Now of course we can talk out tough things we\u2019re going through and try to be there for each other, but it doesn\u2019t feel like a self destructive therapy session every other week. I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being a jerk or not in this situation or if I\u2019m overthinking stuff. Maybe I\u2019m just outgrowing the friendship? Any thoughts or input? \n\nTL;DR: Friend is always in and out of my life and everyone else\u2019s. He makes self destructive choices and started an open relationship with his GF before he goes on an abroad trip so he can hookup with foreigners. I told him it was a bad idea and what he\u2019d possibly risk losing and they broke up this week and now wants me to bend over backwards to hangout with him all the time and to comfort him for what I think is a problem he created for himself.",

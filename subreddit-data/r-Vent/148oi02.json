    "postText": "Everyday somebody in my social media whether it's family or friends... somebody always whining about how they have no friends, or if their friends don't hang out with them because they don't have a baby they're considered bad friends. \n\nI finally deleted my Facebook app and now only use the web version to reduce my usage of getting frustrated with people whining about everything. I didn't really use my Facebook to post mostly to stay in the loop without actually communicating with family but it's not worth the frustration of seeing people whine all over the app cause they had a baby and don't have any friends that want to hang out with them. \n\nI've even had some of these people get mad at me because I refuse to \"hang out\" with them meaning some of them just want a free childfree babysitter. People like that that make me angry. Just because we chose not to have children doesn't mean we don't have a life of our own.",

Which usually leaves me the only one without one \"watching\" them. I've gotten rid of most of my friends for the most part. If you can't find a babysitter then you shouldn't expect your friends to cancel their plans to hang out just because you can't go. It's not fair to ruin their night because your stuck at home with a baby. I do agree to an extend that you should be able to hang out with friends with your baby but you shouldn't expect them to cancel their plans to go to the club because you couldn't find a babysitter or the baby sitter canceled. They can always go another time with that person. \n\nI quit going to family events cause people left me watching the children while they wondered off because they assume I wanna be watching children since I don't have any. It's not my responsibility. I don't mind a few minutes but I shouldn't be stuck watching them for hours because I have what parents think is plenty of time.",

It just really sucks that all I see anymore in my feed is people and their 10 thousands baby photos and them whining about having no friends issue.",

Just know you\u2019re totally valid in your feelings and don\u2019t need to be around kids or babysitting other kids if you don\u2019t want to! It\u2019s hard, but don\u2019t feel guilty with your family or anything",

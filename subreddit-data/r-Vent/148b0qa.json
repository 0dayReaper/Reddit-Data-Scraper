    "postText": "So I couldn't sleep, and since my email was being \"your inbox is nearly full\" I decided to clear out old stuff. It's all going well until I get to a bunch of Facebook notifications from years ago and it just dredged up all these emotions from a painful period of my life when I had a severe anxious breakdown which... I don't want to get into since it only further dredges up things, which is part of the problem maybe cause I could probably try to repair things, even though it's been years, but I still have problems facing that period since the memories are so attached to the emotions I was going through at the time, it's still hard to process even though it was all just stuff in my head, but that was making things hard to process at the time as well, so maybe it's just some kind of self feeding cycle? Idk, I just needed to vent and work through my current emotions. I've been hearing psilocybin is good for that sort of thing, detaching emotions from thoughts, but getting started is just kind of !!! And then something else distracts me like my email, and so on and so on, it's just, like blah? Idk, I'm kind of rambling at this point, which is making me feel better, since I'm thinking other thoughts, it's just, brain frying in the end, which I don't like since I like I generally like thinking but after these its hard to so I need something gentle on the brain and now I know I'm swapping between rambling and spacing out so I think I'm good now, goodnight",

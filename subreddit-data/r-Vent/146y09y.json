    "postText": "I haven\u2019t slept in five days besides drifting off into small naps, I can\u2019t do it anymore. I have insomnia and my depression is worsening it. I can\u2019t sleep no matter what I do, I can\u2019t get a break. I just want to sleep. You don\u2019t know how it feels to try to sleep for 30 minutes straight with no success. I can\u2019t take pills as I don\u2019t have access to them. I\u2019m so tired but I can\u2019t sleep. Friends are starting to worry about my health and so am I, my depression has been getting worse over the past week and I don\u2019t know what to to help it. I don\u2019t even feel sad. Just feel numb, I feel like I\u2019m gonna be hopeless for the rest of my life. I\u2019m only a kid I shouldn\u2019t have to be going through this. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.",

Your best option at this moment from best to worst is to go to the hospital with parents and inform a doctor (ideally your family doctor).\n\nOn a good note, eventually your body will become so exhausted that you will go unconscious whether you like it or not and sleep probably for 12 hours or more and feel a lot better when you're up. Maybe a bit of a weird headache but less stressed.",

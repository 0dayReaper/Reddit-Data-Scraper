    "postText": "I started not eating/heavily limiting what i ate in late December and lost a decent amount of weight by February it wasnt really super noticeable and i still thought i was fat but i was at least proud of myself But since March i have been in a binge episode (i guess thats what i should call it) I have no self control and im not even really hungry at all i just eat for no reason i guess and it wont stop and its killing me i can barely fast for 2 days anymore and now im at the same weight i started at and i feel disgusting and fat and i dont think ill ever get to my goal weight but i still dont want to recover id rather get extremely thin and die than i would to recover but at the same time i hate how much its changed me not on the outside but the way its changed the way i think and now i feel guilty about any thing i eat every single time i feel so much regret i cant even put it into words how bad the feeling is and i try to throw it all up but it never works and another thing is that my parents dont know and there are times where i just want someone to talk to about it because i feel like having to keep it to myself this whole time makes me feel worse but im also embarrassed to tell anyone because i may have an eating disorder but i dont look thin and even though my parents dont know my mom has told me \u201cyour getting to thin\u201d (not in a concerned way) or \u201cYour so skinny\u201d and i wanted to cry even though thats what ive always wanted to hear i just dont understand what is wrong with me now all i want is to finally feel happy with myself",

            "comment": "That definitely sounds like an eating disorder. I know it\u2019s generic advice but it would be a great idea to tell your parents how you\u2019re feeling. Also, not feeling as though you can fast for 2 days is perfectly okay. You don\u2019t have to fast for days in order to lose weight, though losing weight shouldn\u2019t be your focus for the moment. The things I\u2019ve heard are best for maintaining a healthy lifestyle/diet are intermittent fasting and intuitive eating. Intermittent fasting is where you set a specific time range each day of when you\u2019re allowed to eat, for example, from 12pm-8pm each day (8 hr periods are most common). Intuitive eating is essentially just listening to your body. Think about what would make you feel good when eating it and afterwards. I know that just eating until you\u2019re content can be a difficult thing to do for someone in your position, which is where you might need some counseling. Know that you will get through this and recover, and that your family will likely be more caring and open to seeking help than you might think. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re going through this and I sincerely wish for your recovery.",

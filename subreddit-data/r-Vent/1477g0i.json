    "postText": "I\u2019m not sure why but lately I\u2019ve been dissociating a lot and it happens sometimes when I\u2019m talking to people. If they notice they don\u2019t say anything. I feel bad because I feel like I\u2019m in another world and when I am aware of my surroundings it only reminds me of all the bad things around me. Sometimes I\u2019ll remember past traumas and dissociate again and then sometimes it\u2019s random. But uh yea",

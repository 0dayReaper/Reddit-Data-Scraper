    "postText": "So basically I\u2019ve always had problems with cleaning up after my messes due to my discipline system at home, basically if you didn\u2019t clean you\u2019d get a good old black whooping \ud83d\ude2d and I didn\u2019t really follow the rules cuz the more I didn\u2019t clean the more I got whooped and the more I didn\u2019t want to listen. But I\u2019m kinda older now so I gotta follow the rules, so I still don\u2019t clean up after myself. And I was kinda in my college classes and I got a text from my brother asking me abt where something was and I said I was eating it and accidentally left it in a room. He started telling me I was the reason for many problems of why there\u2019s so much trash in the house and I first I didn\u2019t care but then later I realized he was sorta right. I started trying to blame it on my mom for the discipline system and he told me it was just my fault because if I cleaned there would be absolutely no issue what do ever between me and her. I never really liked my mom because of how many times she\u2019s put her hands on me, and also touched me in general when I\u2019m really uncomfortable with touchy people. I\u2019ve never been in any problems with people touching me like cases or something, I just never really liked it. \n\n\nI kept making excuses knowing damn well I am the actual problem. I try my hardest I really do but honestly I don\u2019t know what is wrong with me, I think it\u2019s how much I\u2019ve been not okay. I\u2019m underweight, I don\u2019t eat much, I don\u2019t leave my room much. I started just recently getting out of the house but otherwise I don\u2019t leave otherwise and it\u2019s really claustrophobic. Sometimes I genuinely feel like I can\u2019t breathe. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m ranting, but obviously I\u2019m the poor Len so I\u2019m probably going to start training myself to do these simple tasks. I shed like two tears but I just got upset idk.",

    "postText": "I work in a medical in home company for people with brain injuries.  I work two doubles and two singles a week for six shifts at the same house.  Over the past month during the day time when houses are empty because the participants go to a rehabilitation facility house food, the automatic can opener and a personal room trash can have gone missing.\n\nThe person that does it (Karen) ((not real name just this is how she acts)). She has access to the houses during the day along with access to the grocery office and the chemical and cleaning supply office.  First it was house food set for the week, like 50$ of food.  I went down to the grocery office and got it back.  Because it was the food we were supposed to make for the week.  She retaliates by next week taking the can openerer so it's a hassle to have to go to another house to open cans so we can cook.  Now this week a room trash can for a participant that wears adult diapers went missing.  Literally just found it,  it was moved to be hidden outside the house.  \n\nI complained to a manager about this and they try gaslighting me that I'm crazy and the trash can has been missing for months.  I use it every day.  My main site manager had no clue these things were going on.  We have cameras in and outside the house.\n\nThe Karen does things like this randomly because the company was bought out by a Corporation.  The corporate head office removed her title because it doesn't exist in the new company.  She removes stuff from houses so everyone is in a deficit and needing more stuff all the time.",

    "postText": "Hello, this is gonna be a long one so I apologize in advance, but I'm in a \"long\" distance relationship (2 hr drive) for the summer with my girlfriend. We\u2019ve not been the greatest bc of the summer break and we ended up talking and she said there\u2019s no spark and alot of other things. \n\nLittle background for you: We go to college together and we live in the same apt. This will be the start of the second year of us living together this upcoming semester and we've been together for almost 3 years, but Everytime we go on a school break for a holiday or the summer and I go back home she always starts picking out the bad things in our relationship and gets super depressed, thinking the worse and can't forgive me for my mistakes l've made. She said I've hurt her (heart) and she doesn't trust me after that day. Tonight she said some really hurtful things that still sting. She said \"it's easier to give up when things get hard\", \" I don't feel connected to you anymore\", \" there's no spark\". \n\nAlso, what makes it even worse rn is that I\u2019ll be going on a vacation this Sunday  and I\u2019ll be on a cruise ship for my 21st birthday. A topic she has been worried about is me getting drunk and cheating since I\u2019ll be by my self. She says it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t trust me. We have each others locations on multiple platforms, we can always see where each other are. But she\u2019s been talking about an end and isn\u2019t sure of us. IMO I feel like she\u2019s doing this stuff and acting like this to protect her self from hearing bad news (me cheating on vacation) \n\nI am happy in this relationship, it's not perfect but nothing is. I've always had the attitude to work on it and make it better and learn to love each other the right way. I just wanna know what I can do to get the spark back. I love this girl so much I tell her everyday. I cannot lose this girl please someone help me. \n\nThank you",

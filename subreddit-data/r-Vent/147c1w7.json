    "postText": "I 22f am in love with my male bestie. I think I always have been but never really accepted until it was to late. We met when I was 12 and he was visiting family for the summer, he had everyone I knew talking him up to me and I was like \u201cok cool but who tf y\u2019all talkin bout\u201d lol. When I finally seen who he was I was kinda like he cute ig kinda funny look like jay-z tho. But nether the less we end up having a \u201csummer romance\u201d til I \u201cbroke\u201d up with him cuz he wanted to kiss to much lol. Fast forward some years he moves to where I live and we fall back to being friends but apparently everyone could tell he still liked me but me of course. Over the next few years of high school we basically play crush tag, one min I like him and he\u2019s moved on and the next min he likes me but I\u2019ve moved on. Then I graduated and met my now husband 23m and this was when we first were getting to know each other but I was hold back cuz I was still crushing on my best friend hoping he\u2019d notice I like him now lol. Then it finally happened, my bestie came to me and said he loves me and always has and to choose him. Guess what my dumbass did? Told him I loved him but I couldn\u2019t be with him cuz what if he cheated on me or ignored me like he did his exs smh. We cried and the next thing I knew he was in a relationship and was in basic training. So fast forward me and my husband (then bf) we\u2019re on a break and he (my bestie) broke up wit his gf and we\u2019re Tlking like old times again, and then I find out I\u2019m pregnant smh. I love my son but I felt like me n bestie were finally having the \u201cright time\u201d moment. So then me n my husband get off the break I move in with him n me and bestie don\u2019t tlk a lot anymore. Then 3 months after my son is born me n my husband get married and I can\u2019t help but think about what could\u2019ve been sometimes. I love my husband but it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t understand me or even want to n I have to be this whole other person to him instead of myself. Recently I find myself realizing I love my husband but I\u2019m still in love with my bestie.",

    "postText": "She spends 5 hours a day on that stupid app, up to 8 hours a day on weekends, and it has replaced everything else in her life. Her personality used to be free spirited, inventive, outdoor loving, and fun. She rode horses, she volunteered, she sewed, and read more books than a library could hold. She hasn't done any of that in months.\n\nEver since she downloaded that stupid app her personality has just become the shit she sees on tiktok, when of course she's not staring at her phone watching tiktok for hours on end. Lately she's been telling me to get her a $5000 kitten because a person on tiktok had one. She doesn't even say the breed of cat, just that she wants a \"Toast cat\". She obsesses over makeup even though she rarely leaves the house because she sees hours of that shit a day.\n\n Tiktok interferes with her work, her home life, whatever hobbies haven't been completely consumed by the stupid fucking app, and even her schoolwork. She's in her twenties and working on her Masters, and I have to beg her to put down her phone and work on her homework. She'll procrastinate until 11 PM when a paper is due at midnight, and I know for a fact her grades have gone down the drain.\n\nBut most embarrassing is that she won't even get intimate with me anymore; it distracts her from tiktok. Her idea of cuddling is facing away from me and staring at her phone,  moving away if I get too close. Sex is her doing her best impression of a dead fish, making no sound and not moving, staring wistfully at her phone and counting the seconds. Then at the first opportunity she'll gleefully say, \"TIKTOK!\" shove me away, and completely disregard me to watch videos, whether or not either of us has come close to finishing. That the only sound she makes is that stupid app's name is making me hate the idea of sex.\n\nI hate Trump but when he announced that he'd block Tiktok I cheered, because it meant I might just get my girlfriend back.",

I try my hardest to get through to her, heart to heart, about this issue and I get results for two ot three days before she's back to square one.\n\nShe complains about being tired and about gaining weight when all she does is lay in her parents' basement all day and watch tiktok. But of course things will be better when we're married, according to her. I don't want a marriage based on a dead bedroom, a technological addict, and me breaking my back trying to bend over backwards for her.\n\nShe's never been ugly to me, but if all I see of her is her face zombified from staring at her phone then I can't say I'm attracted to her.",

She has turned into someone else from the person you fell in love with.  \n  \nIt seems like she is not interested in changing so now you are left with a difficult decision.  You can stay in a relationship that makes you unhappy, or you can move on.    \n  \nIf I were you, I would give it one last talk.  Tell her that this is causing you to reconsider whether or not you still want to be with her.  Tell her that if she keeps up with this behavior that you will need to move on because this is not what you want in a relationship.  Don\u2019t phrase it in a way of \u201cyou need to...\u201d Phrase it in a \u201cthis is not what I want in a partner, and if this is how you want to be, then we are incompatible\u201d.\n  \nI am so sorry that you are going through this.

I was tremendously stressed from school and my self esteem was taking constant nosedives. When that happens, all of a sudden I want things that are impulsive (e.g. I want to be a farmer even though I know nothing about farming, no wait, I want to raise quails even though we live in an apartment and I have never raised farm animals, no wait!!! I want to make my own jellies and sell them on the internet...etc). \n\nThen, when I calmed down and realized I was being impulsive, I would get depressed again because I felt like I could never do anything with my life and I was useless and then a new video would come up and we\u2019d be on another path again. \n\nUnfortunately, she\u2019s the only one who can pull herself out even if she\u2019s aware of the cycle. All you can do for now is to take care of yourself and make some pretty difficult decisions on YOUR behalf if you feel the need. You can still be supportive should she decide to change her behavior, but not at the expense of yourself. \n\nShe may be experiencing depression and using the app as a form of escape",

I thought I had major depression for most of my life because those were the symptoms you most often self report causing distress. Turns out no, I have bipolar II which doesn\u2019t have mania and the hypomania I do have sounds a lot like your impulsiveness. I always confused it with a good mood or being happy for a short while before I sunk back into a depressive episode but it turns out I was hypomanic and was just in a cycle of depression and hypomania.\n\nRegardless of if that is the case for you or not I hope you are doing well now. I just know that bipolar disorder without the manic episodes is *really* hard to diagnose and went for years thinking I would never be able to control my mood like normal people.",

I think that her obsession with tiktok is potentially just a manifestation of depression. The reason I say this is because I first developed depression when I was 10/11 years old and I started going online a lot more and escaping into the Internet. It wasn't the internet that made me depressed, though. I just started using the internet a lot more because I was staying inside all the time and it was a low effort activity.\n\nYou say she used to be bubbly and outgoing, and is now withdrawn and never leaves the house. She's lost interest in things she used to enjoy. Her sex drive has decreased. She's suddenly always tired and has gained weight with no real explanation. Her grades and work performance are slipping.\n\nI'm not going to say you have an obligation to stay with her, but I do want to say that this could be an issue that can be treated. If it's an issue that can be treated, you can get your girlfriend back.\n\nEdit: I also want to say that you should not give her a stern \"talking to\" like some people here are suggesting. It won't do you or your girlfriend any good, and could seriously fuck with her mental state if she's depressed.",

You have no obligation to stay with her just because she's depressed, but the answers to these questions might tell you whether or not it's worth trying to push through it together. If you're highly invested in this relationship and truly in love with this woman and not just infatuated, I personally think it's worth trying to stick it out and help her through it, provided she is open to you trying to help her. But if you don't feel like this is going to work, don't feel like you're in love with her anymore, and feel like you're acting as a therapist and not a boyfriend, you should leave.\n\nI have depression too and I understand where you are coming from - it takes a LOT of emotional labor to take care of yourself, *and* another person who's also depressed. I have ended a relationship before when I felt that my partner was in too deep of a depression for me to be able to handle. She didn't take care of herself or bathe regularly because of her depression, which was really hard for me to handle as her partner. I felt bad about it, but it was ultimately best for both of us. We were both people struggling with severe depression, and it was not compatible.\n\nIf your girlfriend is willing to acknowledge that there's a problem and that she needs help, I think that's a sign that the relationship could work out after all. I really think she should see a psychiatrist and a therapist. But if she refuses to help herself or even acknowledge that there's a problem, don't waste your energy trying to \"fix\" her.",

She honestly sounds like she has a laziness/excuse cycle going. That is a core behavior in how people operate. That doesnt really go away. People who \"do it to themselves\" and then endlessly make excuses about why it isn't their fault always do that.\n\nAnd if you are already in a sexless relationship that wont get better with more pressure being put on the relationship in terms of commitment and marriage. That will only exacerbate the stress of it all. You feeling resentment over your partner not wanting to physically express love and be intimate with you. Her resenting you for making her feel pressured into sex out of obligation and putting her down a path of only hating it and doing it to let you get it over with so she can move on with the night, of not growing to withhold sex and not wanting to touch you at all.\n\nThose are not good foundations for a girlfriend let alone a marriage. \n\nIt isn't tiktok. There will be another thing that comes along and brings out the same behavior. Take seeing it now as a gift and move on. It is really really really hard to follow through with breaking up with someone you both care about but also know is holding themselves and you back. \n\nYou deserve to be happy and with someone who can take basic care of themselves and have a basic healthy relationship with you.",

From my perspective, you've tried. You made it extremely obvious that you have tried and tried and tried again. From your account, it looks like she isn't even interested in trying to change, trying to beat this addiction. A couple of days at a time of \"effort\" on her part before going right back to tiktok? Only because you 'nagged' her into it, so now that she did _something_ she can be proud of herself and you should \"leave her alone\" to continue with the app. Dead fish sex while staring at her phone? Yeah, no, major red flag in my perspective. You have done far more than enough, brother. \n\nSo I look down on the people saying \"try counseling\" or \"don't be too hasty to break up\". You tried. She's not interested. Protect your mental and emotional health. Consider breaking up with her. You owe it to yourself now.\n\nAnd who knows...maybe that break will be enough to snap her out of it. I'd still say to move on completely, though.",

You are a priority, and if she's neglecting your needs then that's on her. \n\nOr you can continue being there for her at a distance.

From what I understand about addiction there's a stage where the person with the addiction does not understand that they've changed, and part of the intervention is to try to let them know that they have changed. In order to solve a problem you need to first acknowledge that there is a problem. She doesn't seen to think there is a problem. If you can get more people (like her parents) who care about her to point this out, that would probably help. If that works and she acknowledges that she has a problem, then try to support/encourage her in getting professional help. What you've described is straight up addiction, which is a mental disorder.

I\u2019m in the U.K. but I\u2019m still a guy and I think my advice will be good even if I don\u2019t share the American desire to shoot everything that moves with my 2000yard kill protection weapon! Jokes! Eff me! The U.K.\u2019s so messed up its like a pissing contest to see who can be worse! You guys must look at our parliament and cringe (we do too!!!). You guys really need to embrace a well made cup of tea though! And stop making coffee in a microwave! Dear God!!! Anyway! Sorry I digress!!! On to the good stuff!!! :\n\nI think there\u2019s 2 ways of looking at this, she gets some enjoyment from the app, so there\u2019s a hole in her life that the app is filling, and it\u2019s not necessarily a you shaped hole, even if you feel like it is... I\u2019d say go for a compromise... you need to acknowledge that this is an outlet for her, but you perhaps need to Discuss needing more time as a couple, tech free... perhaps hiking (phone in backpack for safety!!!) would be good or a camping weekend. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t bring sex into the conversation, that\u2019s just you speaking out of frustration of everything, and to be honest, don\u2019t share that stuff with anyone other than her, if she found out it would be embarrassing for her and that shit could ruin your relationship! If you want better sex, do the dishes, the bins, the laundary and clean the toilet, make those your regular jobs, just because \u2018so she doesn\u2019t have to!\u2019 And let her know! \u201cJust so you know I saw the toilet needed cleaning so I did it, I\u2019m just letting you know so you don\u2019t need to do it!\u201d Then look at the surprise on her face and chuckle!! Remember! She\u2019s supposed to be your friend, not your mother!! From now on you\u2019re a team!!\n\nI would perhaps say to her something along the lines of \u201c You know I love you right? Can we have a chat?\u201d And if she says yeah, but brings her phone, say \u201clook, you finish what you\u2019re doing on your phone, I\u2019ll make us a coffee and we can sit and chat at the table.\u201d Chances are, she\u2019s going to know things are serious, because it sounds like \u201cwe need to break up!\u201d And when it turns out to be \u201cI want to make our relationship stronger! You must know I find your tiktok habit a bit annoying, but I must do stuff that annoys you too! What do you think we can do to make our relationship better? Because I figure if I\u2019m not enjoying it that much at the moment, and I admit it\u2019s because I sometimes feel neglected because I\u2019m a man and like any good man I need a dog style \u2018attaboy\u2019 to make me feel my worth, especially from you! Who I love!!\n\nDon\u2019t be too proud to get help! We guys want to prove our strength tho our little ladies (my wife\u2019s 4 inches taller than me, but you get me!) Sometimes the strongest bravest thing to do is to ask for help (and you\u2019re already doing that now! Awesome!).  I would recommend either professional counselling - anyone tells you that\u2019s a sign of a poor relationship is a Fing idiot- if we changed our outlook and caused it relationship strengthening, we\u2019d fight over appointments, because who doesn\u2019t want a strong relationship with their best friend!!! She should be your best friend! And you hers really! You\u2019re Team Fing Klondike! Ooh rah! We did this marriage course before we got married, it was from a church minister, but it wasn\u2019t religious (Nicky gumble (UK) the marriage course) but it taught you how to think about the other person, and it taught you how to communicate well... and more importantly how to argue well! And that doesn\u2019t mean winning! It means letting go of past hurts and forgiving the person, apologising for your mistakes and never bringing up past arguments... Never use \u201cYou always\u201d \u201cyou never\u201d because we both know that whilst it feels like it, it\u2019s not true \u201cyou\u2019re always on your phone\u201d no, I sleep 8 hours work 8 hours etc etc etc!  Perhaps \u201cdo you think we could arrange a schedule where you can still have your tok tok time, but we could also get some quality time together? Okay! Cool! How much TokTok time do you want? With work, sleep, and eating, we\u2019re only together 6hours a day, how much time do you want for your phone? Etc etc.\n\nThere are some ways in which you can only fix yourself in a relationship, but you also need perhaps to open more opportunities for dialogue.  One or both of you might need counselling (for yourselves!) to deal with your own past hurts! That\u2019s okay! We need to focusing on making our own best selves! Whilst allowing our loved ones times and opportunities to do the same! \n\nWe\u2019re the guy, so the role of protector will fall to us, rightly or wrongly, and it\u2019s in our DNA! I think you need to fight for your relationship to make it the best most enviable relationship you can! \n\nYou can do this buddy! You\u2019re team Fu&lt;$ing Klondike! \n\nOoh Rah!\n\ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd70",

Her personality used to be free spirited, inventive, outdoor loving, and fun. He exercised, he volunteered, he fished, and read more books than a library could hold. He hasn't done any of that in months.\n\nEver since he downloaded that stupid app his personality has just become the shit she sees on reddit, when of course he's not staring at her phone looking at reddit for hours on end. Lately he's been telling me to get him a reddit awards just because someone on reddit had them. He obsesses over Keanu Reeves, Bernie Sanders, and Bill Nye.\n\nReddit interferes with his work, his home life, whatever hobbies haven't been completely consumed by the stupid fucking app, and even his schoolwork. He's in his twenties and working on his Masters, and I have to beg him to put down her phone and work on his homework. He'll procrastinate until 11 PM when a paper is due at midnight, and I know for a fact his grades have gone down the drain.\n\nBut most embarrassing is that he won't even get intimate with me anymore; it distracts him from reddit. His idea of cuddling is facing away from me and staring at his phone, moving turning away when I get too close.. Sex is him doing his best impression of a dead fish, making no sound and not moving, staring wistfully at his phone and counting the seconds. Then at the first opportunity he'll gleefully say, \"WHOLESOME KEANU CHUNGUS 100!\" shove me away, and completely disregard me to scroll through reddit, whether or not either of us has come close to finishing. That the only sound he makes is that stupid app's name is making me hate the idea of sex.",

I know that tiktok has things like you said she was interested in an can make you think you're getting shit done but not, or even feel unworthy of your art. Maybe get her to tiktok the things you miss her doing? If you love her try and help as much as you can but know there is a point where she refuses help you must let her go. You can't save someone who refuses to leave the house that's on fire but at some point you have to get out yourself or you'll go down with them. Super sad and hard! Sometimes addicts have to hit rock bottom in order to heal....\nI'm so sorry your going threw this and is really phone addiction really sucks. I think society is realizing that and there are programs for it. See if there is any in your area.\nSo sorry love\ud83d\udc9a",

There probably have been way bigger scandals, scams, etc. TikTok somehow manages to be worse than all those things in my book. \nMy sister is in a similar situation as your gf.\nEver since she started these hard drugs(let's face it, that's what TikTok is) she has:\n1. Started to compulsively do dance moves at every opportunity. Eating a meal with the whole family? Dance with her head and one arm while she eats with the other. Walking around the home/outside? Dance with the limbs not needed for walking.\n2. Barely goes outside because she's either wasting hours watching TikTok vids or practicing dance moves(although the dance practicing is ok, provided she does it without it interfering with the rest of her life)\n3. This is in tandem with Roblox, but if she isn't busy with TikTok she most definitely is busy with Roblox, and vice versa. \n\nIf we intervene in any way to make her pause her usage of these two things she shouts or ignores us.\nTrying to talk to her is no use, taking away her phone/PC is no use because she'll activate T.A.N.T.R.U.M. Protocol and won't stop screaming until she gets her TikTok back.\n\nShe's 12.",

It's also because there aren't a lot of purebred flame point breeders out there. Even if you did have the money and were willing to pay for one, it would likely be a few days drive just to get it. Let her know this. Hopefully it'll clue her into the fact that she's asking way too much, let alone the cost. \n\nI'm sure you were joking, but just to put it out there, you know, just in case you weren't, it wouldn't be a good idea to lure in a stray. Most, if not all, are feral and a real pain to deal with. My sister adopted a feral  kitten and even after 5 years, the cat still hates most people. She even attacked and tore my brother in law's leg up pretty bad, all because he was trying to get her back in the house at night. \n\nGo to a shelter, sit on the ground with the cats and kittens. The first one that comes up to you will be the nicest.",

You have contributed very little other than to manifest your own prejudices in plain sight.\n\nNobody is saying GF is perfect or should be given a free pass. OP needs to clearly communicate his issue with her social media addiction and be clear that the relationship will not continue if she chooses to spend so much time and energy on a stupid app.\n\nThe Red Pill suggestion would be \"LIFT BRO AND APPLY DREAD LEVEL 5\" but really- a clear conversation about how this level of social media addiction is not OK for this relationship would suffice just fine.\n\nLife isn't always about hit it and quit it. Sometimes you actually have to talk to your girlfriend about shit that needs to change. I know that's a scary concept when you could just lift and next, bro, but I assure you people are often quite willing to work within the domain of a relationship if you give them a chance.",

I'm saying that she presented a version of herself that he was interested in.\n\nOther than her becoming a TikTok addict, you have no evidence that her change was due to her \"dropping the act.\" You also have no context here that supports her interests as being part of a mating strategy rather than a legitimate part of her personality and life.\n\nAnd, given the fact that we all know how addictive social media apps can be, you really don't need the additional hypothesis of \"it's because everyone gets bored and drops the act\" when the hypothesis of \"social media can quickly hook anyone\" will do the job just fine.",

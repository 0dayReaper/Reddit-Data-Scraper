    "postText": "Hello everyone. I\u2019ve come to the decision that I will be seeking conversion services. What I\u2019m really struggling with deep down is lesbianism, which can\u2019t be cured (in my opinion) but there are modern solutions to my problem. I will be seeking out conversion/corrective services to properly deal with these feelings. I don\u2019t believe in the lgbt community\u2019s agenda as someone who was indoctrinated by them since I was little. I was practically groomed into this lifestyle and I can groom myself out of it. I\u2019ve already been working on it.\n\nI will always struggle with the feelings but I don\u2019t have to call myself a lesbian or transman or live the lifestyle. Practicing the lgbt lifestyle is a sin and I will be punished for it on judgement day. Best to stay out of it.",

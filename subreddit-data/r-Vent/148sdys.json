    "postText": "Since i started making friends and being in friend groups i always somehow managed to be the one to blame, i guess i was an easy target because im quiet and dont adapt to new social groups as easily. I've been friends with this girl we'll call her Anna, me and Anna have been through several friend groups together but somehow she was always the innocent one even tho in reality she is super mean and always wants things to go her way and her way only. Recently I've noticed an odd behavior in my friend group i suppose i was being \"ignored\" ?. No one would talk to me in person and i was basically just standing there listening to them talk, tonight Anna reached out to me and started saying how i basically dont care as much about my friends because i didn't say anything about them ignoring me. I was just scared to say anything i thought they needed some space. Apparently my behavior was bothering them but instead of communicating with me they chose to ignore me. I'm just tired and very confused",

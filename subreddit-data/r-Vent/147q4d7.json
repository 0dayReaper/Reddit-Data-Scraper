I have indeed fallen in love with my best friend...\n\nYou were wrong about many of the assumptions that you made about my personality and many of the actions you took in response to your assumptions.... although, you hit the nail on the head when you said that I fell for you.\n\nI tried my best to keep it to myself... I still do... If I had the words and the time to tell you how I see you, your entire world would be that of wonder and beauty. \n\nYour body is a holy place to me and your soul is a wild dystopian multiverse of which I would have told stories to the stars if you would have let me explore it. \n\nYou said that you had a dark side l, as many people do... You feated that I would be deterred by the void....yet you taught me about the balance of the illuminesce contrasting the dark matter of souls...\n\nI will support and cheer for you from afar. \n\nOn the day that you raise your arms up high in victory and expression of pure peace and joy... I will be a noble onlooker... I will celebrate with you... Because no matter where your soul goes... As long as you are the mighty warrior that I once knew... You are amazing to me.  \n\nI apologize for not being able to be what you want me to be... I refused to change in fear of losing myself...\n\nInstead, I've lost a piece of me. And gained a new way of loving",

    "postText": "I was looking through my old art and found out a few things:\n\n1. I improved a LOT over the years.\n\n2. It\u2019s really nice looking through old art, especially ones that I thought I\u2019d never see again.\n\n3. They were not terrible.\n\nI thought that I might cringe looking through them, but they were not all that bad. There were a few that I did cringe at but the majority of them I thought they were actually good. I\u2019m glad I did this because I\u2019m really struggling with my art. This helped me learn that I am an amazing artist, back than and now.",

    "postText": "I Just graduated and I'm finally done. But I don't feel happy. Im supposed feel happy yet I'm not. I feel content yet a void fills my heart. So filled yet so empty. People have sacrifice so much for me yet why do I feel like this? Will I ever fill the void that's in my heart? Will I be stuck here forever and never grow? Will this person fiver be my first love?  Only time will tell and life will move on. I can't say I got everything I wanted but got most. But the person I want the most is happy.so i'm  happy, but yet sad at the same time. I know that life will be better without me. I think that I'll travel the world and find that person who needs me. Cause the person I need the most has found their person who they need. I don't know what this feeling is, but I know I hate it.",

    "postText": "\nI\u2019ve come to a big realization. I don\u2019t have a personality, at least not a likable one. I\u2019ve always wondered why I end up pushing everyone away, or why people leave or avoid me. I think a big part of it is that I\u2019m not interesting as a person. I\u2019m not ever really excited to do stuff, I\u2019m not extroverted in any way, I\u2019m never outwardly happy. I don\u2019t have a personality. I\u2019ve found the only things remotely likable about me are my interests, and so I\u2019ve substituted that for my personality. Instead of \u201cbeing\u201d a person, I am \u201cdoing\u201d a person. Just acting out the motions. I wondered why I couldn\u2019t keep a stable relationship even platonic with anyone, and I think this is it. I end up exhausting everything out of my \u201cpersonality\u201d and tire myself and the people around me. People have always given me flak, especially my therapists, for responding to \u201cdescribe yourself\u201d with the things I like, rather than who I am. Because I am no one. This is such a huge deal for me. It causes me to lose everyone I love, and I have no idea how to even begin developing a real personality.",

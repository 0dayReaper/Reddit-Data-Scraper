    "postText": "Hi, I've been in love with a boy for about 2-3 years, since the first time I saw him.  \nWe've become friends rather quickly, actually, best friends and all.  \nI always have been that friend that is basically your confidant, the friend that you can always count on, ask anything, tell anything, that would keep your secrets, that would be there, anytime you need, that would always do something to be there for and with you.  \nAt first, it were obviously for interest, but, within the first year, I've realized he would never love me back, and although I were still in love, as I'm still is and will probably be for ever, I decided to be natural, to be a REAL friend, and I've done that.\n\nIt were good to have a true friend, my only, by the way, but, some days ago, I made a mistake:\n\nWe were playing Minecraft, in the new version, and I built a nice Cherry Wood treehouse for him.  \nSecretly, I've posted on Twitter a screenshot with something like: \"Building a house for the love of my life. (I'm not the love of his life)\". Something innocent, for fun, but...  \nHe somehow managed to find me on Twitter, and probably saw It, before I were able to delete it; now, he stop talking to me, ignore me, pretend I'm not there when I join a Discord voice chat, lie about having something to do (He doesn't) to not be with me, and simply refuses to elaborate, to talk to me, to give me a chance to explain, or at least apologize.  \n\n\nNow, I'm here, alone, with no friend at all, even less chance to be with the love of my life, as friend nor as lover, all because of a stupid Twitter post.  \n\n\nI'll never move on, he's simply too perfect, even IF, and I don't believe I'll, IF I find a partner, I really don't think It'll be near as good, If it were with him.\n\nFor I have none to talk about it, I came here. Much Obligated for taking your time to read this, good night.  \n",

I\u2019d say move on and barely pay him any attention, or at least try to explain your feelings to him. If he\u2019s inconsiderate to them, doesn\u2019t want to hear your feelings, or doesn\u2019t return them, then you know you have to move on.",

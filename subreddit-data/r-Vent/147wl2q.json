    "postText": "hi, i\u2019m(f) 19, turning 20 in october, and i\u2019m 225lbs. two years ago i was 115-125lbs. i gained so much weight in the last two years, mostly because of my workplace, a popular fast food restaurant, and because i didn\u2019t realize i was gaining weight until i was 200lbs. this causes me a lot of dysmorphia in my body. i hate people taking full body pictures of me, i can\u2019t try on clothes in a fitting room, and i can\u2019t wear anything tight anymore. i hate my body and have cried for days on end about how badly i wish i didn\u2019t screw myself over by eating so much junk food. i dont know how to help myself. my gf said that we will start going to the gym, as she needs to gain some muscle, and she will help me lose the weight. i\u2019m so happy i have her. my problem is that being overweight kinda runs in my family. my grandma and mother both were/are overweight. my mom had a surgery to lose the weight and now can\u2019t eat more than 3 bites of a salad without feeling sick. what i\u2019m most worried about is the saggy skin when i lose weight tbh. i dont want that saggy skin. i cry to my girlfriend about how i don\u2019t feel pretty and how i just wanna be able to feel pretty with myself for once, because i feel disgusting. i look like a pig. my girlfriend even said when we first met that i would have made anyone get a little wet in their panties. what really stood out to me in that comment is the \u201cwhen we first met\u201d. i know she didn\u2019t mean to have it come off like this, in a way that it makes me feel like i\u2019m not pretty now, but that\u2019s what it did. i\u2019m not pretty anymore, i\u2019m not skinny, i used to be gorgeous and i used to be able to wear dresses and skirts and crop tops but now i live in sweatpants and baggy tshirts. i just wanna be pretty again and i don\u2019t feel like i ever will be. i tried to do a sit-up today and i couldn\u2019t. two years ago i could do 500 sit-ups at once with no problems at all. i just, i need help. how do i make myself feel pretty again\u2026",

She was never any less worthy of love, or been less loved by me through any of it. She's always been as beautiful as the day we met in my eyes.

It takes willpower and motivation to keep it up, so always remind yourself that molding your body into what you want it to look like is *not* an overnight process. It takes time. It's disappointing that you can't go to the gym once and see a difference, but stick with it for even just a week and I promise you'll start seeing changes, good changes that motivate you to keep it up.\n\nYou got this, dude.",

I lost all the weight I\u2019d gained back. Cutting down my portions also helped a ton.

It snuck up on me too and I felt like I was wearing someone else\u2019s body. So I started off by consistently working out 30 min a day- what you do doesn\u2019t really matter as long as your heart gets pumping and you\u2019re moving around. And I limited junk food to weekends only- within 1 month I had lost 10 lbs. and once you lose the first 10 you feel SO motivated and then you can step up your workouts and clean up your diet even more.

When facebook says look back at this memory and i was so skinny and pretty. I had no idea then. I was so self conscious i wish I realized. Right now I\u2019ve weaned off some medications and dropped weight. Im blind to it honestly but other people comment all the time and feels better. I hope you and i can both get back to where we want to be. Just believe in yourself. Use app calorie counters or one of those watches that count steps. You got this!",

There's other stuff like fibers and sugars that are important to consider too but I don't know as much about that",

I'm sorry that you're struggling to love your body right now. \n\nI have struggled with bulimia since middle school, and I've been hospitalized and on the brink of death as a result of it, and yet I *still*, some 15 years later (and healthy) am often overwhelmed and disgusted with my current body. \n\nI spoke to my doctor recently and explained the situation. As someone that has always been a small- average weight, I've been putting on nearly ten lbs a month. She's running tests on my thyroid, my cholesterol, and other fun things that I can't really recall, and we're going from there. Sometimes it's situational (job, stress, change in eating habits) while other times it's a combination of things that sort of rock our world. \n\nIf you have an hour to spare at some point, I highly suggest tuning into Bailey Sarian's dark history podcast on YouTube, Spotify or Apple music. Find the episode on diet culture. In my worst moments, it helps me to remember that we are not meant to be so thin. Capitalism, paired with consumerism has made impossible body standards something we are constantly striving for even though it isn't always a safe or realistic solution. \n\nWe are meant to mirror the goddess bodies chipped and shaped from marble that have been displayed for centuries. Our bodies and our curves were thoughtfully carved into the walls of ancient caves by our Neanderthal ancestors as a tribute to thick thighs, curvy hips, chubby tummies and strong, soft arms. \n\nWhatever you decide is best for you, know that your body- as it exists in this very moment- is beautiful. Sometimes we just need to adjust our idea of beauty. Good luck, OP! And happy pride to you and your gf from a queer auntie. \u2661",

I would estimate my ex gf weighed slightly more than you do and I still thought she was gorgeous. Anyway, 225lbs isn\u2019t that heavy in the grand scheme of things, if you want to lose weight it\u2019s definitely possible and as you\u2019re currently not that big I don\u2019t think you\u2019d have much loose skin afterwards either.\n\nYou\u2019re only 19 and that\u2019s so young, you still have plenty of time to turn your life around! When I was turning 20 for some reason I had an existential crisis \u201comg I\u2019m old now, I\u2019m an adult, still not where I want to be in life, I\u2019m a failure\u201d, but now I\u2019m 22 and I realise that was just the beginning of my independent adult life, and in that space of just 2 years I\u2019ve been able to make a lot of progress towards where I want to be in terms of my career, appearance, responsibilities etc.\n\nFirst step is to try and not gain more weight, so change your diet and do more physical exercise. Fast food is absolutely awful, not just in terms of fat but also in chemicals, hormones and pesticides. Definitely change that and start making your own meals (not only is it healthier but it\u2019s also way cheaper if you do it in bulk and make a meal for both you and your gf for example).\n\nRemember you still need to eat though, please don\u2019t starve yourself because that\u2019s actually counter productive to losing weight. You lose weight at first but then once you start eating again your body suddenly gains it all back because it thinks \u201cI need to store more fat because I need backup fuel reserves because I\u2019m not eating enough regularly\u201d. I speak from experience! You need to do it gradually and at pace.\n\nMost importantly, be KIND to yourself. You will stay a lot more motivated if you reward what little progress you make. The biggest barrier to losing weight is motivation. The first step is always the hardest but once you start it gets easier. Good luck!",

My friend used to be close to 250 and he got down to 200 this past year by just cutting down his meals. Now we\u2019re going to the gym together again, and that helps out so much. Trust me, I\u2019m one of the least active people I know, but if I can spend 30 minutes walking and doing a few lifts, you can too! Good luck and I hope you are able to reach your target weight in no time!",

            "comment": "If you want to loose weight, there are a few steps you should take in my opinion. Firstly, any outside factors that discourage you from exercising, you need to cut. This doesn't mean working out for hours on end and snapping at anyone who questions it (not saying you will, just saying don't overdo it). But little nagging thoughts like \"my problem is that being overweight kinda runs in my family. my grandma and mother both were/are overweight\" you need to try your best to ignore. Once you have taken full accountability and control over your exercise for, lets say a year roughly, and you are still seeing no progress, then you can have that conversation and come to terms with it. There is no reason to believe you can't do something when you haven't even tried. the next step is the hardest: starting. weight loss is not comfortable work. you will not see much progress for the first few months. you will be sore and tired. you will have to eat foods you would rather not. and you will have a lot of doubt. Cardio will be your best friend when it comes to weight loss, as lifting weights doesn't burn a lot of fat. A certain amount of control will be needed when it comes to what you eat and how much you eat. I would recommend picking up cooking as a hobby and preparing yourself some healthy tasty recipes designed for weight loss. no more take out, no more soda (there are 77 grams of sugar in a 20 ounce bottle of mountain dew alone. that is over half the bottle). In my opinion, you don't need to change your job, but if the temptation is too much, i would consider it. There is no shame in this, you are helping yourself, and that alone is seriously respectable. The way i would stick to exercising regularly is through a schedule. try and do cardio as often as you can, maybe once every two or three days. those rest days are important for not burning yourself out immediately and falling back into bad habits. try and be doing something pretty consistently whether it be work, exercise, hanging out with your partner, etc.. and get into a routine so when it comes time for exercise, you'll feel a responsibility to do it. Even get your partner on board and have her help you hold yourself accountable to it. You're at a massive advantage having someone with that much emotional sway in your life that cares for you and your well being. use that advantage. and finally, don't do too much too quickly. Pick exercises that are already difficult for you, not ones that \"should\" be difficult for you. no shit you couldn't do a sit-up, you're not exactly in the best place physically right now, don't expect yourself to be able to do that. try some water aerobics, jogs, biking, hell, even walking and standing up and sitting down are all cardio and are important if that's the level you're at. there is so much self expectation for where you should be, and not enough reality of where you actually are, and the steps YOU need to take for YOU to loose weight. You're not in someone else's body, you're in your own, and your workouts need to reflect that. Keep in mind, none of this is easy, but i feel like you're the type of person that will make change. I pray for your progress, and think of the end goal so you can maybe start to enjoy the journey.",

You need to eat to be able to live life to the fullest. 3 square meals a day and don't be afraid to have a snack if you're hungry. Its your body telling you that you need fuel. You should still eat all the things you enjoy in moderation. Make sure you're getting enough protein because protein will keep you fuller for longer. And keep in mind that carbs are NOT bad. They give you the energy you need to exercise \ud83e\udd70\nAs for loose skin, use cocoa and shea butter, but at the end of the day, loose skin is a normal part of weight loss and lots of people have it including me.\nI promise you, you are beautiful the way you are. Every body is beautiful and every body is different, so please don't compare yourself to others. I know its easier said than done, but I'm rooting for you, love \ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d",

I did not have any saggy skin issues either ;) \n\nWeight loss is tricky in the fact that you have to look into multiple things at the same time. Diet is by far the most effective tool you have. So, since you have this job, see if you can improve your meals. Instead of that fatty burger see about making some chicken breasts mixed with salad. Instead of that ice cream, see about fruits. Exercise: find something you like and something that distracts you. Walking with a podcast on your phone, or biking with your favorite tunes, chorus pedal faster or harder. Skipping rope and adding new tricks every now and then.\n\nBut more importantly in all of this is your set of mind. You are doing this for weight loss. But I'll ask you to do this to prove yourself how strong you are. To prove that you can beat the old version of yourself. And every few months, stop, meditate and look into your achievements. Weight loss may take up to a year or more. But this year goes by fastest when you realize that each day you're doing better than you did before. Remember that your past you didn't need you, your future you does.",

If you ARE planning to make some changes, read on\n\nAs a gym goer, my advice is to make slow and steady changes. Any sudden introductions of intense dieting or exercising can drain a person quickly and drain one's drive. \n\nFirst understand that genetically, ppl are all different. I'm more prone to lose weight, you and my partner are more prone to gain it. But that's simply how we're made. So don't hate yourself\n\nSecond, good health does not always 100% mean lower weight. I know three streamers who I've been watching since 2014, and one of them is supposedly \"big\", one of them is very wishy washy about the gym, and the last one is a gym rat who is a chiseled chad, who eats as healthily as he can. Guess who's had the most amount of health issues that required surgeries? You guess it, the last guy. \n\nThird, tying in with my second point, while eating healthy is a good thing, losing weight is not as simple as \"eating healthy\". Caloric deficit will. Meaning burning more calories than you consume. And restaurants have more calories than you'd expect, whether it's fast food or a fancy dress gentrified place. You will experience a decent amount of change by implementing something as simple as walking or running. \n\nDon't like those? That's fine. My buddy bikes for cardio. I play volleyball at the local rec center. My other friend started martial arts. Another plays tennis w her dad. Another plays table tennis w his brother and aunt. There are many methods for you to exercise in fun ways that fits you personally. \n\nFourth, 225 lbs will not give you loose skin. My big friends used to be 250ish. No loose skin on them as far as I can see",

It's simple and low-stress, and you can use it while you're sitting down and on the computer, watching TV, etc. On Amazon and eBay they start at about $30.\n\nAlong with cutting calories you might want to look into some probiotics, like Lactobacillus gasseri BNR17 for example. More of our weight comes down to our gut biome than we realize.\n\nYou can do this. I know it's hard, but try not to be too hard on yourself, and be patient. It's better to lose the weight more gradually anyway, so give it plenty of time. I'm glad you have a supportive girlfriend to help you with this process.\n\nThat comment you mentioned that your girlfriend made reminds me of one my housemate, one of my closest friends, made. He was reassuring me that I had a great figure before I gained weight, and he didn't realize how the comment came off. It does really hurt when that happens. You know they're trying to be helpful and supportive, but it still hurts.\n\nTake time to appreciate your progress. Even a couple of pounds down is progress. Celebrate those wins. It'll feel great to see the difference!\n\nYou can do it!",

But I looked great and felt great. Now, I'm 32 and 260 pounds. It's been gradual over a 12 year period. I was 230 pounds about 5 years ago and got down to 200 pounds over 6 months in 2018. I was so proud of myself. Then, I got pregnant. And 6 months after I had my first child, I conceived my second. All the weight I lost came back and then some. Depression and anxiety doesn't help. Nor does my adhd(my motivation is non existent). And ofcourse, covid 19. Lmao. Having to stay inside sucked. \n\nI feel ugly and gross. And alot of my weight goes into my chest. So I have to buy expensive bras and I feel awkward in my body. Anyways, I have some good days. Where I try to not think of my weight as what I am as a person. And I continue to try to better myself. Eat healthier. So even if I'm fat, I'm not eating terrible food like fast food. My problem now is just exercise and the motivation to exercise. But we can all get there. Even if it's a slow process. And there are no fast methods to losing weight(the healthiest way is exercise and eating right). I believe in you. But remember, you have a wonderful spouse who loves you. I do too. They love me as I am even if I don't always love how I look. Love isn't physical beauty. That's just attraction or whatever. And someday, we all get wrinkly, saggy, grey and old. That attraction doesn't last forever. Only love does. We all just have to continue working on ourselves to be happy where we are. My goal is 150 pounds. But I'm taking it day by day. Even if I lose 10 pounds, I'd be happy. Lol. One step at a time.",

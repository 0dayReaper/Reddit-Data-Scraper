    "postText": "CW FOR PET LOSS\n\nOur (family dog) Snoopy is 15 years old, well over 100 in dog years. We got him as a rescue when he was about 2 or 3 years old, and he\u2019s a good dog. He had a stroke a few years ago, and despite that he still was kickin\u2019! In the last year, even the last few months, his age has caught up to him; he can hardly stand up without help, he doesn\u2019t eat, he is incredibly skinny, and he would rather lay down than anything else. We took him to the vet this morning for a Quality of Life check, and, as you all assumed, the vet advised it would be best to put him down. We could try medication for his arthritis and pain, but it would only prolong it. So\u2026 on Wednesday\u2026 our beloved old man will be laid to rest and join his brother in dog-heaven. I\u2019m very upset about his passing, as anyone would be of course, but I know it\u2019s what\u2019s best for him. He had a good life, and was happy for all of it. I love him so\u2026",

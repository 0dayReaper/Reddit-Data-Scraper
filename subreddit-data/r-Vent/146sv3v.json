    "postText": "Its almost like he doesn\u2019t have any original experience. He liked to talk, too much and too loud actually. His voice is so loud like he\u2019s talking to someone 20 meters away. I can\u2019t stand hearing him talking. His talking doesn\u2019t based on any fact, real proof or his own experience. He just hear from someone and spread the story to everyone he met without thinking logically or do a 5 seconds google search.\n\nI\u2019m on a diet right now. Started 2 1/2 months ago and loss 12kg already. Everytime I\u2019m on my diet he always have a diet \u2018tips\u2019 he knows from a friend. This is my 5th diet cycle for the last 6 years. And everytime, he always have some tips that doesn\u2019t work, or downright bullshit. \n\nSome of the tips is:\n\n\u201cMy friend told me don\u2019t eat yellow coloured fruit on a diet because it contains alot of sugar\u201d\n\nI replied \u201cif the calories I\u2019m eating is under my maintenance calories i will lose weight\u201d. He can\u2019t accept the fact that I\u2019m right and said with an annoyed and angry voice \u201cI\u2019m just saying, my friend said this so I\u2019m giving you the tips\u201d.\n\nAnother amazing tips he gave was:\n\n\u201cMy friend said don\u2019t weigh yourself every week, the water in your body constantly changes everytime\u201d\n\nI replied \u201cI weigh myself every week to motivate me, seeing the numbers go down will make me motivated to continue my diet\u201d\n\nHe then reply with his annoyed voice knowing he doesn\u2019t have a proof of his tips and said \u201cI\u2019m just saying\u201d. \n\nThe thing is, his mindset is all fucked up on diet to lose weight. He bought a fat burner and drink it everyday but he ate his meals without moderation. Once i saw him cook 300 grams of spaghetti for his lunch. And that doesn\u2019t include the oily sauce he made yet. He said \u201cthe pasta will extract the water from inside of your body and make you lose more weight faster\u201d. Knowing him I don\u2019t say anything and continue my day like normal. He doesn\u2019t count his calories, I don\u2019t know if he knows his maintenance calories. He thinks all the fat burner he drank will help him lose weight while eating without moderation. I never see him with a successful diet.\n\nPosted my before and after picture in my family group chat, around 2018. My most successful weight loss. Loss around 25kg while in 4th semester of college. He said \u201cthe angle of the picture make you look small\u201d. Then i send him another old picture of me sitting down and new picture of me in the same position. He just seen the message and didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nI think he\u2019s the biggest unmotivator. I don\u2019t know if he heard what words that came out of his mouth but he\u2019s always try to say something bad when my family members achieve anything good. He always think he\u2019s right in all topics, no one else can be right but him. He always have story he know from his friends that know from their friends. \n\nSorry if there\u2019s a grammar mistake, English is not my first language.\n\nTL;DR : my big brother always have story to tell that he knows from his friends and he think he\u2019s always right in every topic without fact-check or any real proof or think logically or do a 5 seconds google search. Talk too much and too loud but the most of the words that came out is downright bullshit.",

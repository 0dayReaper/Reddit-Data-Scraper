    "postText": "I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just been hard making it through everyday because i just have so much guilt. I attempted to hurt myself again and i feel like the meds are slowly helping but sometimes i just get the urge to just quit. My friends keep telling me it\u2019s okay and not only my fault what happened after my break up but I\u2019m just so used to blaming myself always. I cheated on my current ex because of trauma from my first relationship and i feel like a horrible person for it. I repented everyday after the breakup and even told my family and all my friends too. Even if i met someone new i would tell them that I\u2019m a cheater. I dealt with my ex\u2019s toxicness for 10months after the break up because I just wanted to make her happy because i knew i fucked things up, i did everything i could emotionally, physically and financially. I fucked my life up just to make her happy because making her happy made me happy. I found peace in the violence. No matter how much she hurt me physically or emotionally i kept letting her do it because i know i fucked up and that I\u2019m a bad person. I did everything i could to make her feel comfortable and loved still even after i found out what she did in January. She was playing me the whole time after the break up, while she was shitting on me. I forgave her for it and i thought maybe now that she\u2019s gotten her revenge we can be nicer to each other but nope, she kept being abusive, kept saying how she wish she did more, blocked me whenever she felt like it because she knew I\u2019d always run back to her. She even pretended to be sus so i can think she\u2019s doing something and my dumbass reacted because i was scared. I thought she found someone else and was replacing me so i started to talk to someone new too, it didn\u2019t help at all though because at the end of the day i just wanted a sense of security with her. I just always make the worst decisions and I\u2019m keeping myself from being happy. Idk why I\u2019m like this now. I was never like this before, I\u2019m glad i stopped and blocked the girl before meeting her but why did i even last a little more than a week. And because of that my ex is gone again, all that fucking effort i put in for months all fucking gone. I feel so miserable every fucking day, i hate everything. My ex is perfectly fine moving on after everything and I\u2019m still stuck here picking up the pieces. Therapy has been helping somewhat and the meds too, i feel like I\u2019m better than before because I\u2019m not reaching out to my ex but it doesn\u2019t change or get rid of all this anger and frustration inside of me. I\u2019m so unsatisfied with life and myself. I let the one girl i wanted slip right out of my hands because i decided to be childish like her, i couldve kept being the mature one but nope. I just cant help but match energy sometimes. My friends keep telling me to find someone else and keep repeatedly encouraging me because they say i can find better easily since ive pulled pretty girls before but rejected them but it\u2019s like, i don\u2019t care about those girls and that\u2019s why i rejected them. They aren\u2019t her, i don\u2019t care how pretty or funny someone is, I\u2019m still connected with my ex and that\u2019s why i put myself through so much shit after the break up, i let her treat me like a dog and thought nothing of it. I know it\u2019s not okay but I guess i just keep telling myself i deserve that treatment because of the mistakes i made during the relationship. I don\u2019t think i can ever forgive myself. I really did everything for this girl.",

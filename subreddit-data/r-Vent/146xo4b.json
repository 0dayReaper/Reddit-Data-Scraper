    "postText": "im on a trip me and my friends have been planning for 2 months. we are a group of online friends currently at my friends dorm, and this is my first time traveling and being away from home alone like this.\n\nthe trip here was the longest 10 hours of my life. it was so unbelievably lonely. there was nothing to catch my attention to get lost in because i was so nervous, and then anytime someone sat next to me i ended up in pain because i uncontrollably tense my legs up when theyre touching someone elses leg. i even spent maybe an hour considering just to get up and find the food car, which turned out to literally just be the one behind mine, and i spent that whole hour in pain because i was so hungry.\n\nthe first night i spent so homesick i was trying not to cry. it didnt help that the spot i was sleeping was so uncomfortable, a hot couch with a hot blanket and a pillow that seemed to absorb all the heat around it. i woke up so many times that it felt like a lifetime.\n\nive also just been so quiet and my friends have noticed. talking all seems to come so naturally to them, but ive never been the best at in-person social stuff. i can never find good spots to join in a conversation because people talk right after eachother and i feel like an asshole interrupting, not to mention i cant even think of anything to say and i dont know.\n\nit doesnt help that im ending up feeling dysphoric. im trans, and ive yet to get the chance to take any physical steps, so i still look the complete opposite of how i want to. i mean, its not like my friends are doing anything, almost all of us are trans, so its not like its their fault or anything, but i just get so insecure when im physically around people who arent my family.\n\nand im also a picky eater and it feels like everything ive eaten so far has just been. bad. even though literally none of them were that bad. my anxiety is just making it even worse, cause it affects my stomach and its made me little to no hungry since i actually got here. i even threw away two things i bought at the store, and i even almost threw away a third thing but i didnt buy it and instead made my friend buy it because i dont even know why i did but i didnt do that cause i dont want them to hate me but i feel like theyre going to hate me and im fucking everything up\n\ni miss my bed, i miss my computer, i miss my cat, i miss my dad, i miss my brother, i miss my nephews, i miss not having to worry about food so much, or my body.\n\nthe fastest route between here and home is a 5 1/2 hour drive. even if my dad or one of my brothers were to come get me, id still be waiting 10 or so hours, but i guess i wouldnt be alone. big issue is their jobs. im almost tempted to take my dads offer of picking me up on wednesday instead of friday like i was supposed to go home originally. i wish i wasnt so damn far from home.\n\nthis was supposed to be super fun but ive spent 80% of the time in various forms of physical but mostly emotional pain. i know its almost entirely on me but i dont know how not to do this, to be like this.\n\nhonestly a big reason i didnt even make my family take me home was cause of fomo. ive been that person before who missed out on an event and suddenly all my friends came out of it with a new inside joke that they wouldnt stop referencing. i dont know\n\ni know i sound fucking stupid and shit. i must sound so selfish and dumb, i dont even know. im sorry.",

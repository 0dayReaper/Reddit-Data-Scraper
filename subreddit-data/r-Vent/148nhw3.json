    "postText": "It has been a hard 3 months for me, I have struggled to get/keep a job, Currently working through college living off of ramen most days, Eating 800 calories or less a day as a 6 ft 1 24 year old. Family not able to help me so i just do odd jobs as i can for scraps of money at this point. I just wanted to get some of this out of my head i guess, Having it all cooped up in there has been difficult. I feel like i am starving all of the time and i cant catch a break. I have lost 25 lbs in the last 2 months, I go to food banks but most of the things i get end up being expired or not very well taken care of so they go bad shortly after i get them. I don't really know what to do anymore at this point, Just wanted to complain is all.   \n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read.",

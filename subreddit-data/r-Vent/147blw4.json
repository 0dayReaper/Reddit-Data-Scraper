    "postText": "\n\n\n(This is a very brief run down, I could go for days on all of and what I\u2019ve been through and witnessed)\n\nMy ex husband has been mentally abusing more than ever trying to break me down to back down in my custody battle. He has hurt us all, but he has never gotten in trouble because he has a badge and is smart to live where he is protected.. right now it\u2019s mediation and they want 750 dollars  and I don\u2019t have it and won\u2019t, which throws me into contempt.,\n\nHe also has a girlfriend who also takes part in this, why talking down on me to my children and the best part about this.. she\u2019s never met me. \n\n\nShe helped alienate my oldest from me and now my daughter is stuck in a situation where she wants to come home but they won\u2019t let her, she has to lie constantly to protect herself and even treat me poorly when needed. It\u2019s been a year now, it\u2019s getting worse and worse.. she has purposely tried to make it look like I denied his parenting time by parking so far in front of my house no one would see her, then took pictures of my house and time stamped location to say she was there and we were all peaking out at her for 30 minutes. \n\nHe has deliberately not picked up younger two either both or just one, then sits and says I deny his parenting time in court. Yet he took my oldest and I didn\u2019t see her but 3 times  from June to February and now I get 16 hours a month.. when up until then I did everything and he\u2019s never done anything. I\u2019m bullied, degraded, pushed around and I\u2019m expected to take it for the sake of the kids.. and I have for years until I just couldn\u2019t anymore. \n\nAny time I try to stand my ground  court order states meeting at a police station (hate it because her sister works there, but ya know my case is also through his county so you can imagine how that\u2019s been.. we\u2019ve been to court probably 5 or 6 times now since I filed to get her back and protect my other two (he\u2019s abusive and so is gf) and the ref wouldn\u2019t even let me speak and I have proof from the past years just how bad it is and just how much worse it\u2019s gotten.\n\nI had a baby in January and it is killing me, I have only had my kids together 3 times in a year.. and I just don\u2019t have the fight anymore.. I want to just end it and I know I need help but I can\u2019t get it because my ex husband is such a monster he will use it against me. He uses my post partum hospital stay against me and even when he beat me up and his department pushed to me in a mental hospital to keep me quiet.. as if I had gone yo jail for getting one hit in they\u2019d have to then deal with the fact I was covered in bruises.. \n\nI am sick with lupus and anyone who knows autoimmune issues stress is a big trigger for flares.. well I\u2019ve been steadily sick for the past year and a half, 2020 I was originally told I had fibromyalgia and I have struggled since before that with the pain.. but this a new level, I\u2019m coughing, I can\u2019t stay out of the bathroom, the sun breaks my skin into a heavy rash, I\u2019m in so much pain I have no real quality of life..\n\nAnd I\u2019m going to lose everything because of it all, I\u2019m so sick I went from being a GM making great money to losing 40 grand in income due to how bad it is.. so now the man who\u2019s never bought them anything, not even clothes has now started buying big stuff and taking them on adventures every weekend.. and all I hear is about how great it is. Which I get their kids, but in manipulation tactic as they all told the courts how bad they are \u2026but they don\u2019t actually care about kids. \n\nI am losing everything because I can not get away from the abuse and I cant get healthy.. if I don\u2019t end it; I think the illness and stress will..\n\nAnd I know I sound shitty as a mother, but I tried years ago to get away from him when we were married.. I never thought it would continue and get worse 5 years after a divorce. He can\u2019t hit me so he uses my kids and attacks me as a mother.",

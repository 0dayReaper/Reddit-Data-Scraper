    "postText": "This is like the 4th time I've woken up this night being so hungry that I'm in pain. And now I can't go back to sleep even though I'm very exhausted. And that happened yesterday and the day before too. For almost a week, I've barely eaten. At first, it started as an accident. I have work early in the morning and I often don't feel like eating before I go in, so I wait until I'm there to eat a small snack and then I usually eat again on break and I'm fine and then I eat again right when I get home or after I take a shower. And my job consists of a lot of physical labor/sweating so I need to make sure to eat and drink water or I will feel like crap.\n\nWell for some reason, one day I didn't eat during break, so I was very hungry after work that on the way home I stopped for food. Now I usually don't do this. But after I ate it (Thursday) I didn't eat again until dinner time and then I ate very little. And then the next day I was less hungry, so I barely ate again. And then the next day I only ate once. Yesterday I tried to eat breakfast and dinner but didn't finish. I just can't eat. I want to but I feel so sick when I do. And it's really messing with my mental health, I think.\n\nI keep getting sad for no reason and I'm on edge a lot and nervous, seriously feeling like I'm just gonna randomly break down. At work on Friday I was super close to crying, and this weekend I actually did 3 times. Now I did have issues with depression and anxiety in the past, but I take a medicine to help. The medicine has been pretty good and I only feel bad if i forget to take it for a couple days. Until now. Because I have taken it every day since last Tuesday and I feel like this anyways. I want to die. It's so scary. I feel like I have no one to talk to. Yes,  I have friends but it's hard to talk to them about this kind of stuff. Yes, I still live with my mom but I don't wanna talk to her either. I'm 19 btw. \n\nMy head feels so weird and I keep feeling like I'm gonna throw up even though I probably have nothing. And I feel like I'm slowly killing myself, its so scary. Yes I do try to eat but I just can't do it. Also for some reason I keep thinking of the worst things ever, like bad situations I was in in the past and it makes it worse. Now I do get intrusive thoughts from time to time but now this time it's really really bad and very frequent. I feel so nervous. Like I have a lot of pressure in my chest right now and it feels so weird. I wish it could go back to normal. I wish I could just eat something and not feel like this anymore.\n\nEdit: so I just remembered to add that I've always sort of had eating problems, not because i didn't WANT to eat, but because I would honestly just be so busy that I would forget and I wouldn't get hungry until late in the day. So for as long as I can remember I've been underweight and very skinny and for a couple years it was a problem that the doctor told me I needed to focus on eating more. But I've never had a problem like this until now. And actually for the last few months I have been eating better and I got my weight up to a closer to normal level and I've been able to build muscles. But now I just feel so weak.",

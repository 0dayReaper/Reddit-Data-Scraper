Just be straight up.\nAnd yeah, of course, no one owes anything to anyone, and at the same time, but I guess it\u2019s the courtesy factor when it comes to social interaction. Maybe it\u2019s the sign of the times? I dunno.\n\nFor people who have been ghosted, how has it made you feel in the past? For ghosts, why do you do it? I\u2019ve been on both sides of the fence, but I think I\u2019ve grown up some.!",

            "comment": "I can respond as someone who's ghosted people before. I don't do it nowadays anymore but what I can say is that ghosting is usually for protection. It's still inconsiderate though to be fair.\n\nWhen you care about someone, being the one to create a sense of finality in the friendship hurts. Endings suck; especially bad ones. Leaving on that note allows you to avoid that ending, even if it will eventually happen over time. It's cowardly but for emotional protection.\n\nThe other aspect of ghosting is because some people are good salesmen. If someone hurt you but knows how to charm you to get you back, telling them how you feel and breaking off the friendship could just result in them guilt-tripping or gas-lighting you and repeating the cycle. Straight up blocking and/or ghosting them basically avoids that issue.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve ghosted someone in the past, but it was out of fear. I went on two dates with a guy that seemed really nice. After our second date, he told me he loved me, kept calling/harassing me, would tell me he wasn\u2019t like other guys. I felt really uncomfortable and spoke to him about boundaries and that I felt uncomfortable/wanted to end things. This man blew up so badly. He kept calling and leaving voicemails, threatened to curse me and my family, cursing me out, saying he was going to kill himself and then went on social media and made a video about me. He told everyone I was racist and that I didn\u2019t want to date him because he was black, that I was gaslighting him into thinking he was a bad guy, and that he\u2019s tired of women. He said all of that just because I called things off after two dates.\n\nAfter him, I met someone who made me uncomfortable after the first date. I tried to be very gentle about not seeing him again, but he kept blowing up my phone to make plans and I was too scared due to my past experience. I blocked him. I ghosted him. I felt really guilty/bad about it, but I was too afraid to go through something like that again. I\u2019m a really shy person and it\u2019s hard for me to even confront people. The one time I did it blew up in my face.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right to ghost people or that it\u2019s justified, but maybe someone has had a bad experience as well and thought it would be easier. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.",

Either fear that the person would become aggressive, fear they'd feel bad and I'd continue the conversation out of guilt. Honestly the latter of the 2 was childish of me and not something I'd do in the future if I was in a dating situation again. \n\nBeing the ghosted - it fucking sucks. You don't know what you did or if you did something, you don't get any closure. It's shitty but there's nothing you can do about it. \n\nThe way I've mitigated ghosting people and being ghosted is just being very honest from day one, letting someone know that if they're not feeling it then there's no hard feelings. Telling them the same thing that I'll be straight up and let them know my feelings and I hope they're also receptive.",

Plus getting ghosted just makes you stronger in the future. Really really nobody should care if someone stops texting them. If a guy/girl stops messaging you then fuck it, I\u2019ll take the hint and go on with my life bc what\u2019s the sense in getting upset over someone that doesn\u2019t care about you as much as you do/did for them? There\u2019s really none. Don\u2019t let one person\u2019s actions affect your emotions, just keep on going. Honestly, at least for me, that second you hear the the ghosted person is upset I get flooded with an ego boost. Terrible thing to say but that\u2019s just me being real. So don\u2019t let the ghoster win is all I\u2019m saying.",

Who knows how many other people she slept with.\n\nBut guess what.\n\nShe tried to come back to me recently. I told her to fuck right off. If someone needs to get run through to realise the person they left was better than the rest, they were never worth being with in the first place.",

I\u2019ve been ghosted out of two relationships and it takes a toll. The unknown is killer. It\u2019s also super awkward to explain to your friends/family, especially when they all respond with some variation of \u201cWell why didn\u2019t you go over and talk to them?\u201d\n\nLike they stopped communicating with me, I\u2019m not gonna go outta my way to talk to them. I verified they were alive and didn\u2019t end up in some horrific accident, my obligation ends there.",

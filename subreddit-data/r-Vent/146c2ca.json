    "postText": "I Found out my grandma has cancer this morning. I\u2019ve been crying all day, my friends called and I really needed some support. As soon as I told them they started accusing me of lying and started laughing. They said they needed proof and started calling me a lying bitch. When I showed them proof they continued to laugh and when I got mad at them they gaslight me and said I shouldn\u2019t be mad at them and started calling me a stupid bitch. My Bsf of 5 years goes \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be mad at me if my grandma had cancer you would be laughing too.\u201d They then proceeded to have a normal conversation and acted like I never told them what happened. I\u2019ve never felt so hurt in my life. This woman is basically my mom and has raised me all my life and for them to laugh at something like that makes me sick to my fucking stomach. What should I do?",

He says that \u201cI\u2019m being sensitive\u201d and then went on to say that he never laughed and that I\u2019m stupid. I honestly hate him now and want nothing to do with him. I\u2019ve blocked him on everything, hopefully I never have to have someone like that in my life again.",

Someone willing to gaslight you on something so painful and personal is just the beginning of the type of abuse they are willing to give you. Continuously calling you dumb and stupid under any circumstances is not okay. let alone when you are going thru a very painful experience. I am so sorry that you are going through two emotionally difficult situations. I really wish the best for you and your grandma. Try and remind yourself we do live in the year 2023 and grandma has so many options open to her for care and treatment. I can imagine what your going thru with your grandma having been in your shoes before with a grandparent. I know its hard. But try as much as you can to just enjoy every moment you have with her. Don't let the diagnosis taint the wonderful momories you've made together. And remember this doesn't necessarily mean the end.",

    "postText": "Me and my dad don\u2019t have the best relationship but even so I still try to be nice to him. I try to be interested in the things he\u2019s interested in. I watched endless of movies I never really liked but pretend to enjoy for the sake of our relationship. Even when he was wrong I never said anything I just agreed with whatever he said so we wouldn\u2019t get in an argument. I laughed at his jokes even if they weren\u2019t funny, I smiled when he talked to the point my mouth hurt to pretend I was interested in whatever he was talking about. Even when we did argue I just pretend it never happened, and talk to him like we didn\u2019t just fight the next day. But I feel as though what I did wasn\u2019t enough because I few days ago he told me said. \u201cNo it\u2019s not nice having me around\u201d I know it\u2019s nothing to be upset about it still got to me it made me feel like all the effort I put into us have a bond was all for nothing, it just meant nothing to him. I know it shouldn\u2019t have but it made me cry I tried not to but I did. I just felt like I did all that for nothing. I now give up on our relationship, I am done trying to fix it. I will only see him as a person I live him. I hate myself for trying to even bond with this guy, I don\u2019t know why I tried. But even so I still love him, even though I say this I am stupid and never learn. So I might try and fix everything again.",

Everyone in my family is able to make conversation within close proximity like nothing. If someone\u2019s sandal came flying off their foot, they would go hours on about how it happened. I get so nervous and confused on how I should talk to people. I met with a therapist not too long ago and she just suggested to go up to someone and talk to them. I attempted small talk with them but unfortunately ended up in awkwardness between me and the other person. I believe it\u2019s not easy just talking about anything with them because they will give off a \u201cwtf you talking about\u201d or \u201cyeah that\u2019s crazy\u201d type of vibe. I honestly wish it was that easy to get along with other people. But of course I wasn\u2019t born with a outgoing personality like others, I was bullied for most of my life and I end up being lonely, even lost friends along the way. Sometimes I feel like I was better off living in solitude than be around people. I need help, I don\u2019t know how to talk with other people in person. Even when I was younger, my retarded self thought me being pretty will get people to talk to me as a friend. At the end, it was just for arousement from people.  So any advice will be helpful. To help me learn how to talk to other people",

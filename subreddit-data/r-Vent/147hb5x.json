    "postText": "so i am in my 20s and have a disability which has caused deformities in my hands, feet, caused me to walk different. kinda like a penguin haha. and you can just look at me and tell i\u2019m physically \u201cdifferent\u201d and just how i move around .. and i\u2019m so insecure about it and can\u2019t get over it. i obsess everyday over how i look and it causes me bad depression and makes me never wanna leave the house. not to mention when i go in public all i do is get weird stares and comments. it makes me just wanna craw in a hole and never leave. it hurts that i can\u2019t even live. i hate being different. i hate the thought of having to deal with this forever. i\u2019m tired of being ugly. it\u2019s so draining. i feel so alone. i don\u2019t know how to survive. i feel like a waste of space. and if i ever see a photo someone took of me, i literally get sick to my stomach and wanna cry. i look terrible. how can someone look so hideous? i can\u2019t live like this. i just really need some advice.",

            "comment": "Sweetie, do they really stare, or do you just think they do? Ok, maybe one or two assholes, but remember, 10% of all people you're ever gonna meet are assholes, that's the rule, but the other 90% are too busy thinking about their own stuff to care. \n\nConsider when you go out, do you stare at fat people or old people or ugly people? I bet you don't, because you're too busy worrying about other things. Well, so is everyone else. \n\nYou ever see those \"I am the main character\" videos of attractive people walking down a street while being filmed and they're all like \"ooooo, look at all the people looking at me because I'm so pretty\". No, the passers by are looking because that's what people do, we look to make sure we're not going to walk into someone or something, we check our surroundings, we look at dopey dogs and evil birds, we see people but we don't _notice_ them. They're in one eye and out the other (bad play on 'in one ear and out the other'). \n\nIgnore that voice in your head, and if you think people are staring at you, ignore them, because they're the asshole 10% and aren't worth your time. 90% of us know that the outside is the least aspect of a person, and what matters is who we are, not what we look like. \n\nAlternatively, you could play into it and every time you go out [make sure you're wearing a formal suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguins_of_Madagascar). Add a [monocle, top hat, white gloves and umbrella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_%28character%29#/media/File:Penguin_(Oswald_Cobblepot).png) if you wanna make the DC nerds smile. \n\n(I find having a sense of humour about your appearance really helps. I'm grossly overweight and while I do feel insecure at times, I know people aren't staring, it's just all in my head. Hell, I wouldn't have the friends I do if I were really as repulsive as I think I am. And I'd kill to be the Penguin, currently I'm more [Jabba the Hutt](https://www.starwars.com/databank/jabba-the-hutt).)",

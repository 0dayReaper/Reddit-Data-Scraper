    "postText": " \n\nSo my MIL told me and my hubby to \"get our lives together\". We live with them clearly (For now at least) because a place here In Arizona isn't cheap. We moved from New Hampshire to Arizona last year in hopes that we would have a place of our own because they were looking at Campers and RVs for me, my son, and my husband to move into when we came out here last year. It's difficult as it staying under their roof, having to endure the BS that they constantly throw at us (Meaning My mother in law) for the most part.) She's a drunk by the way. But anywho, back to the point:\n\nHow can we Get our lives together when her (MIL) and Him (FIL) constantly ask for rent every week from us (Husband and I) We too got other things to pay such as our phone each month. on top of another 75 for the insulation for downstairs so we aren't dying of heat. It's hard to save when I myself got knocked down to just a sales associate last week. It's hard to save to get out from under them when they CONSTANTLY ask for the rent amount EACH week to equal out to what it normally would cost to live an apartment.\n\nWe would get our lives together only IF:  \nTHey'd stop asking for the rent amount each week and allow us to figure out a save plan TO get out then MAYBE we wouldn't be such a burden.\n\nStop berrating us for how we live because that was not our fault. THEY put US downstairs.\n\nStop controlling every tiny little situation that comes to light.\n\nAllow us to make our own damn choices when it arrises\n\nOr better yet continue to help us look for a spot that is close to our jobs so we don't have to go very far",

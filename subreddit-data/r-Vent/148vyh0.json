    "postText": "There are times in my life where I think that I have everything figured out. I have a nice job, I\u2019m a sports reporter. I live on my own in an apartment. I am learning how to cook more and more things and getting kind of decent at it, not amazing by any stretch of the imagination but still pretty good. I have an amazing friend group and girlfriend. At times, it feels like life couldn\u2019t get much better.\n\nBut it always felt like when I was growing up, I didn\u2019t have the support from the people I would need it from the most. When I was in middle and high school, I played three sports, mainly football and wrestling (i was a thrower in track and field but mostly did that so I could stay active during the spring and as a way to stay in shape). When it came to games or matches, my parents never came or were interested. My dad I gave a pass because for a few years during high school, he lived in West Virginia and, well, I didn\u2019t. \n\nAfter matches, while all my friends and teammates went home right after games since their parents were there to take them home, I would often be the one that would have to sit and wait while mine made the trip there since she wasn\u2019t there for the game. At first, I thought that it would change as I got older, but have seen that isn\u2019t the case. Since I got my job, while she was glad that I got a job to use my journalism degree, she still doesn\u2019t read any of the things that I\u2019ve written over the three years I\u2019ve had the job and doesn\u2019t even buy the paper that I write for when she does buy the paper once or twice a week. Her reasoning for buying the other one? Because the comics are better.\n\nMy brother is very similar in the fact that he doesn\u2019t read or follow my stuff, but thats more because he isn\u2019t interested in sports. We\u2019ve bonded more over the other passion I have that we share, video games. I\u2019m slowly turning into a collector and enjoying it. We talk about that once and a while when I go over to do laundry, and it\u2019s enjoyable. My dad did care about the writing I did and everything and once he moved back to the state I live in, he came to as many games and matches when he could. He even read the pro wrestling stuff I wrote about when I did that even though he never knew anyone of the new names. Since he passed, it\u2019s just felt like the one person that should be very supportive in my life isn\u2019t and I haven\u2019t had that kind of support for it.\n\nThankfully, the communities and schools that I cover are always very appreciative and supportive of the work we do when it comes to highlights, game coverage, features or anything else. And while my support system is great, there are still times that I wish my mom was more supportive in what I do and invested in my life as a whole. I just really needed to get this off my chest.",

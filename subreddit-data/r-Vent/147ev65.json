    "postText": "I (27m) have been told numerous times that I am doing everything right in life. I got complimented and praised multiple times every day at work. I'm extremely healthy and have hobbies etc. etc.\n\nI guess no one ever told me how lonely being an adult would be. It just seriously hit today - I haven't been desired in years. Every interaction I have is work/business related. I have close friends, but they're all far away living their own lives. I don't see anyone regularly. \n\nI used to have a bunch of drinking buddies, but I don't really like drinking anymore so I don't see them.\n\nI was depressed, so have spent the past couple of years sorting that out. What's strange is that I know I'm not actively depressed anymore. I love who I am. I can't blame this empty feeling on depression. It's pure, unmitigated loneliness. What's scary is that I don't even know how to make friends outside of work as an adult. I never needed to do that because I always had a bunch of people/friends around me.\n\nI see and interact with so many people at work every day that I usually finish every week socially exhausted but yearning for emotional intimacy. Wild.\n\nThere's part of me that thinks \"Just keep grinding and doing all those career/personal goals you've always wanted to do\". And I've been generally doing that for around six months - living a focused/productive live working towards those work/personal goals. And I've made so much progress on those it's insane. \n\nBut the loneliness is really starting to eat at me.\n\nA woman gave me a compliment at work the other day and I got butterflies in my stomach. That's insane - I would have never been so totally emotionally stimulated by a simple compliment from someone I'm not romantically attracted to. \n\nI'm sure this sounds so cliche, because it is. Nonetheless it's a very real reality. I'm taking tomorrow off for a mental health day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Trash talking has always been in gaming, but it\u2019s gotten so awfully toxic and violent that it\u2019s not some harmless banter anymore, it\u2019s dangerous. \n\nI know a few girls that simply refuse to use a mic unless they\u2019re in discord with a group they know and I don\u2019t blame them. I remember my first experience with this, a friend was teaching me how to play HoN and she was an absolute pro at it. When some assholes that were doing worse than her heard her talk to me they absolutely lost it and started spewing some of the worst shit I\u2019ve ever heard. I\u2019ve been playing online games since I was 12 and even I never got something so horrible said to me before, and shit talking at that age is all you do. \n\nTry not to let assholes like that ruin your hobby. You deserve to enjoy gaming as much as anyone else. These assholes are just a waste of space.",

When I was last standing, they would be like \"ok slut you better hit your shots or else you prove how inferior you are\". Or they'd say \"if you send me your nudes after this game, I'll boost you\" (not to mention this guy was doing worse than me). They had the voices of at least 20yo.\n\nIt was the worst. And it was unfair that out of a group of 5, I was the only solo and I had to deal with that. Ofc I muted and reported them but doesn't get it out of my head and doesn't stop it from happening in the future.",

Do you mean any 2K where people rage in 2K because they can't win a game...\n\n&gt;large majority of gamers that act this way\n\n...because this reminds me of that. They blame everyone but their toxic selves for messing up. Or, do you mean the Overwatch community who, from me playing, is decently chill. Or League who, with my experience playing, have a weird like... not even line. A weird type of cancerous gamer side vs a nice, friendly, and helpful gamer side?\n\nI took a break from league because I didn't want to see my girlfriend cry because Ashe is stupid and saying that she's nothing. So... we took a break. \n\n&gt;someone who plays games and even used to be someone like that, believe me, i know what i\u2019m saying.\n\nFinal thing:\nIt really depends on the game and console I notice. If it's a shooter game on ROBLOX no one but Jerfi182 in the corner who is using hacks will say something. \nOr,\nIf it's a Yasuo main in League, it's a coin toss. There are those who are toxic (who can blame them, their main gets banned 24/7 basically) and some who are (somehow) chill as hell. Even this one guy who I asked how to play better was chill and actually gave me advice on how to play a better mid lane game. I appreciate him. \nMaybe, \nIt's this 9 year old XBOX player who plays fortnite (hate that game to hell) and has 11 wins and thinks he's good and you're a noob because you have 100 zombies killed in CoD Zombies and he has more because he's stealing all of your zombie kills that you warned. \n\nIt's a coin toss and it seems that I land on the better side of gaming and you've seen the worst side of gaming.",

I can kinda imagine how that feels because my girlfriend plays with me and it's somewhat the same there. Overwatch is one of the Games I played with friends (one was a girl) that it was a whatever. People usually stereotype girls to be supports and shit. Not tanks in the front taking everything or people who are the last one standing (like in your case) who could potentially win the game for their team. \n\n\n&gt;\"if you send me your nudes after this game, I'll boost you\" (not to mention this guy was doing worse than me).\nGuys who do this honestly disgust me. Anyone who is doing terribly and say \"Oh do this and I will go make you do much better\" are trash bags who deserve r/niceguys (I think that's what it's called).\n\n&gt;And it was unfair that out of a group of 5, I was the only solo and I had to deal with that. Ofc I muted and reported them but doesn't get it out of my head and doesn't stop it from happening in the future.\nWhile it doesn't stop and never will stop (honestly some people are gross in games thinking they're faker or-... the best Valorant pro or one of the greatest CoD Zombies players ever), just know that, if you really watch pro games, they're chill and the toxic people won't make it to a pro level. That's how I usually get out of being tilted at my own team. Plus, I laugh at my mistakes because we're only humans. We can't do everything perfectly.",

I'm trans and my voice has always given me confidence issues. I think that's also why I hate online games because when my voice didn't pass (pre-transition), I'd often get called slurs, or get mistaken for a 14\u00bd year old boy (which in all fairness, I kinda was one at the time lmfao). Now that my voice passes a bit better, I don't run into it as often, but it's still an issue, so it's definitely a relief to hear that it's an experience that even cis women go through. Still shitty that it happens, but I do feel a bit better knowing that lol. \n\nAlso, if you have a cat, just offer them a \"pussy pic\" and send them a close up of your catto taking an upside down nap with an awkward kitty face, superimpose a middle finger or something, send it and block them. That's usually what I do lol.",

No. I just pointed out the reality of the situation in that being a slightly unhealthy nerdy teenager isn't something limited to guys, and that they should really drop the expectation that every single girl they encounter in an online game is just like belle Delphine. Those people are the exception, not what should be considered the norm. I didn't say those people weren't allowed to exist.

It\u2019s probably the ONLY way they feel higher than anybody and yet all they\u2019re doing is being jackasses and dickwads. The best I can say honey is probably just okay without communication- Mute everybody, unless the one is a friend, and try to play that way. The games I have I have to do that myself, it gets so bad. Don\u2019t let them ruin your love and hobby, it\u2019s probably what they want when ironically they probably complain about not finding a girlfriend who plays video games. \n\nAt some point these companies REALLY need to invest in perma ban by IP address by serious offenders, they can go play other games, but they need to start getting banned for not just being annoying, but down right toxic and bad people.",

What\u2019s the difference between someone threatening to rape my mom and someone saying good game when they are words that don\u2019t offend me either way and have no weight behind them besides causing 10 seconds of thinking well that was rude? If you were to say something hateful to me and give me a million downvotes why should that negatively effect my life? It shouldn\u2019t because it isn\u2019t real and taking it seriously only makes my life worse for no reason.  When it offends me that\u2019s when those words have power. That\u2019s also when people will get joy out of using those kinds of words. Winning is fun and them upsetting women and making them leave is a form of winning aka a form of fun. Humans will always want to beat other humans. Offending a female gamer and getting her to only want to play with other girls is a form of winning and coming out on top. A lot of people need to win something in their life. That is an easy victory for them while in real life there aren\u2019t many easy victories. Maybe I\u2019m fucked up but I think it\u2019s fun to have a shit talking back and forth on a mic every now and then. It\u2019s different with a girl though because it can actually upset them and that\u2019s the entire problem. For normal people it isn\u2019t fun when the playing field isn\u2019t even and it isn\u2019t even with women because certain words have more power. That is bad in my opinion to allow certain words to make it easier to be defeated just because of gender.",

There's no justification for it, and the need to win regardless of context is exactly what a psychopath looks to do.  Decent humans have no interest in such things.

It's been so long since I've felt at home and I just need to go back. \n  \nI haven't felt at home my entire life, I thought I did but I was wrong, what I felt wasn't home it was just the place I lived. I felt so alone and tired and cold, i hated it but I thought that that was just the way things were but I was wrong. Last year one of my friends noticed that something was off with me sometimes and she started to worry about me, she actually cared about me, it was weird think that someone cared about me but it was true someone cared, and she started letting me talk to her about my problems. I told her all I could about what made me the way I was and she started to empathize, this all felt really nice to me but then I told her why I don't think anyone could love me, it's because my own mother didn't love me and she was supposed to love me, and then she held me. We were just laying in her bed and she had me in her arms, I could feel the warmth coming off of her body and I could feel as she inhaled and exhaled each and every breath and it was all so calming, it was so warm, it felt like home. I wasn't alone, I wasn't scared, I felt safe, secure. I loved it. But I messed everything up and now she won't do it for me again. We did this one more time after this where she asked me about all the really bad stuff that stured up a lot of bad memories and feelings I tried to stop from feeling ever again. She asked me why I don't think my mother loved me and I couldn't answer her, I wanted so desperately to tell her about everything she did to me and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't get a sound out, I froze. And she said that if I can't tell her what's wrong then she can't help me. But nothing ever came out so she left. I remember saying as loud as I could witch was a loud whisper please stay with me, please. And then she closed the door and now she won't do it for me again, I wish I could tell her how sorry I am but I can't because every time I try nothing ever comes out. I just want to go home, just one more time, I want to feel like I belong somewhere again, I want to feel safe again. I just want to be happy again, why don't I get to be happy, why don't I get to have a home. It's not fair. It's not fair",

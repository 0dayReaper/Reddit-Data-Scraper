    "postText": "My (M21) family recently left to California for a week and left me home alone all by myself. As an avid stoner who always has to leave the house to smoke, it felt like a good it felt like a good opportunity to finally smoke peacefully in my room for a couple of days, the first days immediately kinda crushed that idea, it was nice, but i was so soul crushingly alone, i of course decided to invite my friends over throughout the week, and even had a party over the weekend. But towards the end of the party my Best friend and my Female best friend seemed to have gotten a little close. In one part it hurts because a part of me liked her in a romantic sense, i never made it obvious nor did i ever pursue it, my logic was that i really love her, but dont feel like a romantic relationship is exactly what i wanted out of our friendship. Instead i felt that if we were to ever be in a relationship it would spoil our friendship and would eventually lead to us being distant and maybe even completely falling apart, and that leads to the other part that has me feeling so terrible, it feels like it could be an inevitable experience that i will end up losing one of them, maybe its cynical thinking but both of them have had toxic relationships recently, my boy never told me about his ex but it was kinda obvious, there always seemed to be an argument and at times he would just disappear for days. And with her well shes told me  a lot about her situationships and such, and things never go well for her,  when i saw all the flirting, and even them going into the same room, it hit me that if something builds between them i most likely will either be a part of it in the sense of like i will most likely be hanging out with both of them a lot since theyre both my besties , and be potentially brought into arguments, or in the worst case ill be forgotten by both of them, these past three days i havent been able to really eat much, ive broken down crying into tears more often than normal, i haven\u2019t been able to smoke comfortably, and have picked up drinking. So as to not seem completely insane, these two are people I\u2019ve trusted to a level i havent trusted anyone else, one being the person ive hung out with the most in the past 4 years and the other is someone I\u2019ve communicated with frequently for 5 years. I dont even know what to feel, or even consider the root of these emotions. Theyre just there",

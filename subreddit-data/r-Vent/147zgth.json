    "postText": "I am studying computer science In university and have all the computer courses completed and finished.\n\nDue to a single course I cannot complete I am being forced to drop out because my mind and wallet cannot handle this failure anymore.\n\nThis course is Calculus 2 which I have taken 5 times previously and am currently taking for the 6th time.\n\nThe first time I took it I got a D which does not qualify to count towards my degree (need a C-).\n\nThe next 3 times I was forced to withdraw from the class after bombing the exams, and the time I took it last semester I got an F.\n\nGetting a below 3.0 / 4.0 gpa would cause me to suddenly have an extra 8000 per year cost to continue attending which I can\u2019t afford.\n\nThe way the course is set up is that assignments and lab\u2019s account for 10%, quizzes 10% and online work is another 5%.\n\nThe ENTIRE rest of your grade is 3 tests worth 25% each of your final grade.\n\nThe test was at 7:30am and I am 90% sure I wont have exceeded 70% even after studying for weeks and working through problem sets provided by the professor over and over again. \n\nBut I just can\u2019t get it on these exams.\n\nThus here I am after 4 years of success in university I am dropping out after being deadlocked by a course that is mandatory but would provide little practical benefit to my career.",

But with just one credit needed, One class, I don't know. You're probably already in debt, what's a little more?\n\nBesides if you drop out at this point every single course you took will have zero practical benefit for your career because you won't be able to get a career within the field that you were studying for.",

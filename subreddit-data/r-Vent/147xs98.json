And if y\u2019all have seen my past posts you can imagine how this went. -sighs-\n\nI\u2019m stressed out and fucking tired af. I\u2019m stressed about work, the house being messy, him, the pets. I need a break away from everything. And I thought a small trip on a cruise would be nice. Sadly he thinks otherwise and is now stomping around the house in a hissy for about it. \u201cWe said we would both go and do stuff together.\u201d And we will but I need to do something by myself. I feel like I\u2019m going to die of stress or something. Now his talking about getting rid of the animals. God just take me early already.",

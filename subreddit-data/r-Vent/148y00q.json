    "postText": "\nI  just have to get this out because I\u2019m doing my best to communicate how i  feel rather than to let it eat my alive later down the road.\n\nSix months ago i  began seeing this girl we\u2019ll call Sarah. We hit it off immediately and ever since have shared everything with each other from our dreams/goals to our darkest secrets.\nWe always had an understanding though that we both couldn\u2019t really be an official couple because at month 8 we both were moving to separate states (me for work opportunity and her for college). Still we treated everyday like a gift with each other. \n\nIt\u2019s month 6 and long story short her contraception failed and we were both in shock. She broke the news to me yesterday after I got off work, but was surprised when i  said i  wanted to keep the baby. Sarah has always mentioned she did not want kids right now In her life from the start because she was so young and also because she saw the trauma her mom went through as a single mom with multiple daughters (5+). I  on the other hand have always wanted to be a father since i  could remember back as a 1st grader. I  was lucky enough to be raised in a bigger family and have a strong support system and longed to create a bigger/better one. Also i  have a strong Christian background where as Sarah is spiritual and not really into a religion. \n\nI  feel like I  damned my first child to death due to my lack of self control sexually. I always was the friend to say \u201cplay stupid games, win stupid prizes\u201d but it is now me who\u2019s played the stupid game.\nSarah feels extremely guilty now because I begged her to keep it and offered to pay for everything and raise the child myself. I  even offered to pay for her college and she just can\u2019t change her mind. She\u2019s too scared of being in the same situation as her mom and mainly afraid of the risk to her body during pregnancy. She also feels bad now that i  want to stick around and fight for the baby instead of what she thought i might\u2019ve done initially by getting mad and leaving her to deal alone. I\u2019m fully prepared to accept responsibility and take care of this kid, but I  know from Sarah\u2019s side logically it makes the most sense not to keep it and it kills me inside knowing my child will suffer for my shortcoming.\n\nSarah feels bad also because I  usually never finish inside of her, but she assured me it was fine, and after i  even offered to pay for the plan b but she had already taken one. The worst part is Sarah asked me to pay for half of the abortion and i  just couldn\u2019t do it. I  told her i  would happily pay every bill to ensure it\u2019s life, but as a father with no say in the matter, if i had just one choice I rather do nothing than to help fund the end of my child\u2019s life. Now I only feel disappointment in myself, i feel I\u2019ve disappointed her, and I\u2019ve disappointed my child and my God. \n\nI  can\u2019t do anything, but sit here and realize my biggest desire in life to be a father has taken the worst blow i could\u2019ve imagined and all i can feel right now is nothing. Nothingness and disappointment. I should\u2019ve trusted my gut and pulled out like I always have because i knew how I\u2019d feel and now look. The doctors confirmed she\u2019s pregnant today, and prolonged her til next week in hopes she changes her mind, but it\u2019s hopeless. I  don\u2019t resent her and i reassured her no feelings have changed between us and I\u2019m supporting her and would never tell her what to do with her body, but deep down I\u2019m not okay.",

    "postText": "(I was going to send this to my boyfriend to vent about life a little but im trying to not complain so much to him) \n\n\nSometimes i get so frustrated when my mom like goes on and on about me and (sister) doing lil things or being messy, and she gets so mad about shit and its like, me and (sister) are so good, especially (sister) she never did anything behind my moms back, we dont go out we dont party, we dont do drugs and stay out all night drinking with people. We are always home always working, but its only the negative sometimes with her, and i love her so much i respect my parents and forgive them for the things we all had to deal with but sometimes its like. U had us, u guys had us with no money and a terrible relationship, we should have been put in therapy in like middle school high school, (sister)has been extremely depressed since like middle school i have come to my mom telling her feelings i have had, and i love her and i know she did her best, but we werent helped in ways that we shouldve been, so now we are older and we are trying to figure out things on our own, (sister) was finally just diagnosed with adhd maybe had shed been diagnosed earlier and been to therapy earlier about her anxiety and depression she would be better at coping with things by now, (brother) too, everyone, my mom is a good mom and she did her best but she doesn\u2019t understand mental health, and we are trying to figure it out by our selves now and all she\u2019s telling us are the things we arent doing, its not helpful at all, its just so negative sometimes and it just like what about the things i am doing, all the things i am paying for, its always just we could be helping to pay for more stuff, and we should be saving more money, and she doesn\u2019t understand how we live so messy, and she doesnt wanna be like how her parents were but shes going to if we keep acting how we are, its like I understand we can be doing things better but we are struggling and we are trying. Its not like we dont care or we arent trying, its hard. And just the way she says certain things sometimes i just wanna look at her and be like well maybe had we been in therapy or didnt have to deal with this or that we wouldnt all be depressed and we would be able to handle things better. Im 19 im paying about $800 a month of expenses, helping with the light bill, paying the internet for the house, my phone bill, car insurance, all my own food and clothes, its not like we are sitting at home not helping and not working, we are trying, can i please just get a good job, I\u2019m starting my own buisness, working, and going back to school in the fall, I\u2019m not lazy, i am tryingggg and i am tired.",

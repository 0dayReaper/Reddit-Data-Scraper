    "postText": "I'm not going to talk about the Rittenhouse Case verdict or my opinion on it, but instead I wanna reflect on the insane amount of people praising Rosenbaum, including celebrities. \n\nIn the Early 2000s, my younger brother was sexually abused with I think about a dozen other kids by Rosenbaum. The court cases are sealed because they/we were minors so I won't be providing the names of any of them or the exact charges. He and every other victim deserves privacy. We already had batshit crazy conservatives try to unseal the case so they could tout around the victims stories as a \"gotcha\" moment. \n\nAnyways, the fucker plead out of like 11 counts of child rape (there were more accusations, they just never made it to court) and only got like 10 years (ended up only being 8). My brother and I are late 20s/Early 30s now and he has mostly moved on but up until he was 14 he would cry almost every night and ask to sleep In the same bed as me or my sister or mom. I can only imagine what the other victims are going through. \n\nNow, somehow he made his way to Kenosha and was shot dead. Whatever. Couldn't care less. Also couldn't care less about the trial or the verdict of Kyle. \n\nWhat gets me is all these fucking celebrities calling him cutesy fucking nicknames and talking like him like he was such a great human being. \n\"RIP Joseph\" \"Such a kind soul\" \"He didn't deserve this\" Pedro Pascal is a good actor but somehow saw fit to call this POS a Hero. \n\nWhat finally made me lose it was Mark Ruffalo's \"RIP JoJo\" What the whole fuck? Literally petnaming him. I'm so fucking angry. This man was a terror who deserved hell 20 years ago and major celebrities are making him to be a Martyr. \n\nMy brother is acting like he's ok through this whole thing and he has been on a media blackout. I on the other hand have been listening since day one and am so sick of people defending a pedophile. I'm so goddamned disappointed in our politicians and celebrities and athletes who all have acted like he was a hero. \n\nHad to get that off my chest, \nThanks",

I avoid the news also because they're quite depressing, can't watch the whole thing without going through all the drama and getting even more disappointed at humanity and I already struggle a lot with seeing people suffer).\n\nBut when I upvoted this comment it was left with 52 upvoted, I left the post and decided to go back to check something, in 2 seconds this comment went down to 46, this means 6 people down voted this comment in the the 2seconds time frame. I don't see anything in this comment that people would be offended about (as it's mostly just the person trying to be supportive of OPs situation) except for the last line, apparently in 2 seconds 6 people found this last line offensive, and I ask myself, in what planet can a criminal be praised and people who see this post and still find it offensive to call him and the people who support him what they truly are, a bunch of mentally insane people.\n\nBut perhaps someone can tell me why people think he was such a great person?",

They act as if they were friends and yet only know him from the incident and what the media says about it. \n\nRegardless of you think about Kyle and his actions, Rosenbaum was looking for trouble .He had just that day been released from the mental institution and most likely wasn't on his medicine and wanted to be shot. We have plenty of videos from the riots showing he was just causing trouble, why does anyone feel the need to say anything at all, but especially positive about him is insane.",

Do the math on that one. \n\nHow many celebrities joked about Harvey Weinstein, knowing exactly who and what he was?

Rosenbaum could have been anyon and the reaction would be the same. [People have defended a cop murdering someone on camera, lying about it, all because the murder victim had previous parking tickets in an unrelated event.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Philando_Castile)\n\nAre people who say that a cop killing someone and lying about it are supporting having parking fines...?\n\n&gt;You don't get to do that and not cast doubt on your own moral and ethical being.  You have aligned yourself with a pedophile and sympathize for him.\n\nThats not how this works. No ones connection or defense of Rosenbaum has anything to do with his criminal past. Again, Kyle shot 3 people. Kyle defied police advisories and went to a riot. Kyle paid someone to purchase a gun for him in another city. And he got charged with nothing.\n\n&gt;Instead, you say something like, \"The guy was a real piece of shit and should have been locked up for life but you know I don't think he should have been shot and killed by a 17 year old in Kenosha.\"\n\nThats exactly what people have been saying. Again, no one is defending what Rosenabum did. But he shouldn't have been killed that night.\n\nThis is a really shitty defense bro.",

What an intelligent response.\n\nKyle was at the protest against police advisory, aligned with white supremacist who were bragging about wanting to shoot protestors (the guy on trial, Ryan, bragged about it on facebook), with an illegally acquired gun.\n\nAnd you are defending him. Lol okay. Hey, you can defend kyle all you want, but at leasst be upfront about it.\n\nLest we forget kyle was beating up girls in a parking lot.",

That part came out in the trial.  The media lied about it.\n\nUp till Rosenbaum attacked him Kyle had been helping protestors, cleaning graffiti, and defended a property from being burned.\n\n*with an illegally acquired gun.*\n\nAt best it falls in a legal gray area.  Was Kyle illegally carrying a firearm that night?  I think you know the answer to that.\n\n*kyle was beating up girls in a parking lot*\n\nIt was a girl.  Not girls.\n\nThe video doesn't shine any light on what happened that day.  It shows a fight and we don't know who the aggressor was or what led up to it.  I watched a couple of videos and one of the guys filming it said, \"She already smacked him.\"  Another guy says, \"He should punch that bitch.\"\n\nSo, we kind of have an idea on who did what leading up to it.\n\nAnd the thought process that women should be allowed to physically assault men without repercussion for their actions is bullshit.  If you hit someone then don't be surprised when they hit you back.",

When he testified in court on November 5, 2021, he said he saw Rosenbaum asking \u201cvery bluntly to shoot him\u201d and taking a few \u201cfalse steppings,\u201d enticing someone \u201cto do something.\u201d\n\nSounds like he very much quite literally was asking to be shot, and antagonized the subject. Maybe he was instigating, or maybe, being a convicted pedophile whose actions have earned him a scorching review of his shitty existence like the one OP shared with us here, that he actually wanted to get shot, saw this young impressionable scared kid 'defending' with his rifle, and thought hey, this is a great opportunity for suicide. Which is not mentally sound behavior, which means he maybe rather should've been locked up in an institution for the rest of his life (shout out to OP, that would have been a far more miserable existence than a simple death, actual hell tbh)\n\nTY for coming to my ~~TED talk~~ mock not-guilty-by-reason-of-mental-disease-or-defect defense",

They're smart. Think about why they never protest over black people killed by the police that have no criminal record. It happens, but you have never heard of them. I'll tell you why. The media knows that white people would be on their side. Instead they only pick people with heinous backgrounds, and sometimes cases where they deserved it (Michael Brown), so white people won't agree. Which makes black people mad because they are told lies about the case through the news. That's how they create tension instead of unification. It's intentional, I guarantee it.",

I had heard only yesterday that one of the guys murdered was a pedophile or something but reading this makes me sick. How in the world can this scumbags history not be brought to light in such a popular case. All of America knows about this trial by now and a vast majority does not know this Rosenbaum information mostly because all news outlets are political and have an agenda to follow. \n\nI\u2019m certainly not political at all but I\u2019m sure the algorithms in my social media accounts show me things skewed towards the left which has an agenda out of proving this kid was in the wrong at all costs, hence why I\u2019ve seen little to no information at all about this. \n\nImagine the millions of people who have information being fed to them through a particular lense on TV and social media who aren\u2019t self aware enough to know there is more information out there before coming to conclusions. \n\nI fell horrible for you and your brother and all the others who sufferers from Rosenbaums acts years ago, good thing your brother is on media blackout because you simply cannot go anywhere on the internet without it being shoved in your face, not to mention all the protests that will happen over the next few weeks. \n\nI\u2019ll be passing this information on to people I know because I know damn well they\u2019ll never find it by chance like I did scrolling through Reddit\u2019s popular page.",

It's a shame that actual justice had to be meted out by Rittenhouse.\n\nPeople defending Rosenbaum are either braindead dumb dumbs who weren't following the trial at all, are hoping nobody is cogent enough to look him up and see his deplorable crime history, or simply don't care that somebody with his criminal record decided to go to a riot solely to cause trouble &amp; are purely politically motivated. Holding this man up to be a hero in any sense is an example of everything that is wrong with today's world. People try to excuse his behaviour by toting out lines like \"he was mentally ill\" or \"he was abused himself\" as if that makes a difference - he chose to continue the cycle of pain and torment, attacking multiple victims. The world is a better place without him.\n\nPutting out a fire doesn't give you the right to try and beat somebody to death or take their gun. If Rosenbaum had any sense he would have stayed home instead of going out to cause trouble. Obviously he learned nothing from his actions, and it's a delicious irony that he was shot dead trying to attack a minor.",

Crying about a dead pedo and calling him cute nicknames makes the hatred well-deserved. \n\n&gt;how they should all be put to death\n\nLefties and pedos shouldn't be *\"put to death\"*, just kept away from positions of power, and jailed when caught attempting to harm others. Being shot as you attempt to kill a teenager is not being *\"put to death\"*, it's the opposite, literally stopped from putting someone else to death.\n\n&gt;George Floyd and Breonna Taylor also deserved what was coming to them\n\nNope, George Floyd was murdered, Breonna Taylor was caught in crossfire during an illegal raid, making it more or less murder.

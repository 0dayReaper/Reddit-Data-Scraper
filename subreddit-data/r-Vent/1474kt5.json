    "postText": "My siblings never wanna hang out with me, my parents are at work all day, the only friends (if i can even call them that anymore) are the ones i left when i graduated, I\u2019m a pretty socially anxious person, i only ever go out to attend my art classes and that\u2019s when i put my best effort to look presentable, i put my all into making my outfits look like how i look inside, so that i can attract some random person who might like my style, and i do, but all that happens is i get a compliment or two and then they leave, i try my best to say hello and good morning to people but again, as a socially anxious person that\u2019s the best i can do, it doesn\u2019t drive anyone to want to become closer with me or get to know me, and I can\u2019t say much\nI like being alone too, but humans are not meant to be lonely creatures, they need company, and i just don\u2019t know how much longer i can take having no one to feel close to",

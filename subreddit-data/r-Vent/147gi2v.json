    "postText": "I really just needed somewhere to post my thoughts so I think this'll do.\n\nI'm 22 year old lady and got my associates degree a little over a year ago. The end of that year of courses (as well as the ones through covid) were miserable. I find so much joy in my major of choice, computer science, but I've never had everything as figured out as all my peers. And its really starting to sting. I spent the good majority of the past 2 years discovering myself and figuring out who I am as a person, but in the meantime everyone else moved onto universities or careers or just anything to further them in life...\n\nAnd now here I am. I've found myself and no one is around me. I don't know what to do in my life and I feel like everyone is looking down on me for waiting to return to college and get my bachelor's. All I really want to do is go back for it and finish out my education. My heart is pulling me to take 1 more year off to save extra money for it because it's going to be expensive. And I'm not sure if I can afford it if I don't save for a year.\n\nI feel like I'm wasting so much of my life by doing this. I can't get into my career path without the degree, and my brain just won't let me *make* something to get myself into an entry level position. I just can't do it. All I do is read, hangout with my 1 friend and maybe play video games if I'm not mentally exhausted...\n\nIdk. I know not everyone knows my situation but I just feel so doomed all the time. Idk what to do. Its 2 am and I'm half awake so I hope my concerns aren't laughable or incoherent lol.",

            "comment": "May I ask why do you feel as if people are looking down on you for not attending university to achieve your bachelors degree? Also congratulations on achieving your associates degree!!!\n\nCollege and university will always always be there! This is not a competition or race to get a bachelors degree, sometimes in life. When we find ourselves in uncertainties such as this. It becomes an opportuntity to sit down and reflect what it is we individually want out of our lives, instead of what our friends and family may want and expect out of us. \n\nThis is a very very uncomfortable place to be in, but it is worth it because you begin to mould and shape your own identity and follow the direction you desire your life to go towards with limited outside influence. \n\nYou read all of the time? Not many people enjoy reading. I remember I worked at Goodwill and I had coworkeres.... Who through away books because they believed reading was invaluable... I was out of place so I did not say much but eventually left working there. \n\nI use to have this same anxiety about the future. But truth to be told, you can only be active in the here and now. And by doing so, you will eventually find your place.",

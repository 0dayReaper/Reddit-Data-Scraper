My mom had said it, other family members and some ex-friends had said this phrase. \n\nMy mom used to make A LOT of anti-Asian jokes and what not, and I told her it was racist. She got mad and told me that she\u2019s not racist....\n\nI\u2019m smart enough to know that she was. I think that phrase need to be corrected from \u201cBlack people can\u2019t be racist\u201d to \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for black people TO BE racist after dealing with racism themselves.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s immature, annoying, hypocritical on so many levels, and it makes ZERO sense. \n\nIt\u2019s literally mind boggling and I can\u2019t stand it.",

I was literally thinking a few days ago how my mom used to talk with an Asian accent laughing about the names on menus or she used to talk in this horrible Indian accent that used to annoy tf outta me. She also used to say we might be \"part mexican\" because we loved Mexican and Hispanic dishes. And she'd even say we \"do it better than the mexicans\". She'd tell my little brother all the time that he \"better but bring home no white girl\" when he was like,  10 and younger. Id tell him secretly that it didn't matter as long as she really loved him and would never hurt him. People might not see it as racist, especially those from her era, but it is. Also, you'll see a few times black people attacking others due to their color. That's literally racism, and yet somehow its not? Just because we don't colonize the whole world or forced people into slavery and killed and raped for every little thing doesn't mean we can't be racist.",

He probably fetishized you, and was pretty much saying \"OK, when I'm done fetishizing you I want to be with somebody normal\", since we all know fetishes aren't exactly normal. He wanted to fulfil his not-so-notmal desire without having to take responsibility.\n\nI mean, I know why, its because of the whole \"(insert race) people bring nothing but trouble\" mindset. With black people not being able to bring home white people, of course it's because of the fact that their child will be hurt, abused, or even killed because of their skin colour,  Mixed with the past traumas that white people have inflicted upon black people. Also because, we see through history the pain that 'the white woman' has bought to 'the black man', like black boys being lynched for dating a white girl or of course the infamous story of Emmett Till. But you can't lump all people together in one group. People tend to forget that, although racism was very prevalent and open back then, there were also just as many white people that were against it, that would treat any body regardless of skin colour as if they were their own. But back then, A lot of people did not speak up for fear of being ostracised by their family, and in this day and age people no longer care about such things. It's 2021, where people are finally seeing changes in the world. Seeing how are able to find a voice in freedom from oppression together, as black with white and not black vs. white.  Sadly, a lot of people these days are closeted racists. They could befriend, Date, even marry and have children or someone outside of their own race and still think bad about that race. Husband and wife could be together for years and during a heated argument one of them could say something racially charged towards the other, or say something like \"you're pretty for a Mexican girl\" or \"I am glad your not like other black girls\" Or they could have a closeted racist family that they still deal with. When it comes to true love, you have to roll the dice.  There will be times were you end up with an abuser, a manchild, emotional wreck, and even a closeted racist. But you can't automatically say that you can't be with this person or that person simply because Of their colour, or you think that they might do something racist or, in the case of my mother in my little brother, have a story similar to that of the movie Get Out.  Besides, in  The case of people that I've heard horror stories about in the past, you could even have people that are racist against their own kind, And therefore treat their significant other like crap. So really, what can you do except what makes yourself happy?",

I think people who support this argument mistake racism for *systemic* racism.\n\nRacism, as you said, is a prejudiced attitude that someone has about a group of people based on race/ethnicity.\n\nSystemic racism is the discrimination and oppression of a certain race/ethnic group through society's institutions, dynamics, and systems.\n\nSo black people can absolutely be racist (towards white people, Asian people, Hispanic people, even towards themselves). But, indeed, they don't perpetuate systemic racism benefiting black people, because a such systemic racism that benefits black people doesn't exist (at least, in western countries, idk about the whole world). Black people cannot oppress white people through possessions, better opportunities, social class, etc. The system benefits white people.\n\nNow, the specific case of black racism against white people is kinda different, it's like some women's sexism against men. It's rather retaliation than pure out of the blue hatred and oppression. But still, it's racism.\n\nAnd I do think being racist towards other minority groups when you go through racism yourself is very weird and surprisingly lacking in empathy.\n\nSo basically, people denying racism against white people seem frankly uneducated to me. Seems like they simply don't understand what racism and systemic racism are, like all these concepts are blurred in their minds. Too bad, because clearly defining these issues helps fighting against them, and recognizing forms of racism/prejudice against dominant groups can help address all sides of the problem and erase the sources of it. Like, addressing man-hating women actually helps understanding where that hate comes from, and how to fight sexism against both genders, and patriarchy. So I'm guessing it's the same for racism against white people. Denying it and painting black people as pure saints doesn't help :/",

As for police officers, I'd say it's normal to be investigated, and that as always in any type of case, there are cases where innocents get punished. But I don't feel like that's part of systemic racism, it's just part of society.\n\nBecause, again, there's no systemic racism towards white people that benefit black people. Even if we consider that those things are systemic, they're systemic responses to racism towards black people, not systemic oppression of white people. Because the system, which is in the end made up of people, is kinda changing and trying to be less racist. And these things don't erase systemic racism towards black people, which influences our whole lives (our whole lives compared to just a word we can't use or the fear of being called racist). Black people are still undergoing racism, even if sometimes white people have inconveniences like this. And these inconveniences don't come from racism towards white people.\n\nI mean, I'm no sociology doctor, but that's my reflection.",

Because outside of these two people, the larger-scale system still benefits white people (better education opportunities, perpetuation of social classes, employment discrimination,...)\n\nAnd btw, I'm not black, I'm white. So even though I don't think it's relevant here, I'm speaking from a white perspective. So maybe I'm missing some important points that a black person could point out, or maybe a black person would disagree with some things because of an insight I don't have.\n\nEdit: but that's my personal take on it. Because systemic racism designates how the system favors white people and discriminates others, not specific people's behavior. So an individual black person who happens to be powerful and racist despite the system they're in is, in my opinion, a regular racist. Because systemic racism designates the system and its consequences, not the persons. But considering that this theoretical powerful black person does use the same mechanisms as white people through systemic racism benefiting white people... I'm not sure that I'm theoretically right about this, I guess that's a question to ask sociologists.\n\nEdit 2: so that's like a great question that actually makes me reflect on racism further, in a way I hadn't imagined.

I feel like that is a more appropriate definition than what my college professor claimed.",

And as with any colony, the locals were opressed, their land was stripped of its resources, and - from what she told me - the french men had no qualms about bedding local women, with or without consent. According to her, there are many Pierres and Jaques' running around, named after their french fathers they never met.  \nThat's why I understand her resentment, despite not sharing it. I would not be surprised to find the same hatred towards Germans in former colonies. Get's over-shadowed by WWII and the Holocaust, but lots of horrible things happened there, too.",

I think unfortunately we all have some biases, that's in human nature, but especially since we were born and raised in a racist society. And denying that you could ever be racist or have racist bias isn't productive. At the contrary, to really not be racist, you'd need to know what prejudices you somewhat believe in! So that you can work on them.\n\nIt would be ideal to not see color, that's the goal. But claiming that you don't is, in my opinion, already a form of racism. Because it's a way to deny that you could ever be racist, but ALSO to deny what non-white people go through. It's a way to diminish their experiences so that you don't have to feel bad about yourself and think about your potential bias. Like, just because YOU act like color doesn't matter, doesn't mean racism doesn't exist, so acting like racism doesn't exist just hurts people who go through it.",

I have bi racial cousins I use to be close with it\u2019s the same feeling. Idk I love everyone I\u2019ll also flat out admit I\u2019m conservative I\u2019ll probably get hate for saying that.

It\u2019s hypocrisy caused by the \u201cVictim mentality\u201d within the black community.\n\nI feel like every race is going through inequality, and it took a lot of thinking and separating myself from what my family was \u201cteaching\u201d to see that black people, my own community, is and CAN be racist to white people. There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cit doesn\u2019t count because they\u2019re white\u201d. People have feelings no matter what race they fucking are, and it sickens me that so many don\u2019t get that yet.\n\nI\u2019ve met, spoke to, interacted with, and even hung out with white people; and I never made anything about race, and nor did they. Same goes for any other race I\u2019ve hung around except for my own (unless they\u2019re like alternative/black-sheep black people). I cannot conform nor put myself around people who keep treating a situation as if it has to be a superior war.\n\nI saw on \u201cThe Talk\u201d ( I think that\u2019s the shows name, I\u2019m not sure), but the discussion was about race, and the black host was putting Sharon Osborne in a uncomfortable situation and Sharon didn\u2019t say anything wrong. But because she defended herself against a person of color, she quit the show. It frustrated me because she\u2019s a kind woman who has done nothing wrong! She had the rights to defend herself, and it made no sense as to why they targeted her for that conversation.\n\nSo I\u2019m sorry you had to hear that/witness/ deal with that. It\u2019s not okay, and it was a million percent racist. I don\u2019t care what people say; I\u2019m sticking up for you and speaking out that black people can and will be racist. \n\nKeep your head up high, because you have done nothing wrong and did not deserve any hate that they may spew at you.",

She explained that the whole \"X people can't be racist\" thing is entirely misunderstood by a lot of the people that say it.\n\nWhen talking about racism from a sociological standpoint (or as it's alternatively called: ***Systemic Racism*** i.e. racism inherent to a system that opresses a group by virtue of it's design), it is defined in part by a power dynamic. One group needs to have more power, whether it's by population, political power, social standing, etc. in order for it to qualify as ***Systemic Racism***.\n\nSo, by that narrow definition that is only applicable to the modeling of social systems, a group that is not in power cannot be racist. As a result, black people **in America** couldn't be racist **towards white people**. On that same note, if I took my lily white ass to China, I couldn't be racist... **but only in the terms of that very narrow and specific model**.\n\nThe problem, as it is with most things these days, is that people take the part that they like to hear, the part that fits their world view, and they throw out everything else. So if someone is a racist and they know they shouldn't say whatever awful shit they're saying, *buuuuuut* they hear that 'X can't be racist towards Y', they throw out the rest of the statement that says 'but only in this specific scenario that really isn't applicable in the sense that you want it to be'.\n\nEdit: As an afterthought, I *really* hope I got all of that right. If there are any folks out there smarter than me (of which I'm sure there are plenty), please point out where I either misunderstood or just didn't grasp what she told me... it's been a while since she went on that (absolutely justifiable) rant about it.",

Even when black people are racist to Asian people or Asians to black people, its by utilizing the existing structure of white supremacy. An Asian person can weaponize white supremacy against a black person as a tool, but it's not totally the same as a white person doing it. And even if a black person say has prejudice against a white person or hates them, they do not have access to a system of racism or even a language of racism. If a black person tells a white woman she has a witchy nose and thin greasy hair because she's white, that white woman doesn't have hundreds of years of imagery and language reinforcing that prejudice into her psyche. While I think it's logically possible for anyone to be racist, I don't think it's possible to completely divorce what we mean by \"racist\" from this really developed system of enforcing a specific racial hierarchy. I think we just need more language and more discussion. Because \"can non white people be racist\" is not a yes or no question.",

Another example could be white south Africans and their treatment with the government based on their land getting revoked due to tensions rising, you can argue that the Europeans colonized on their land and they should be removed but isn't that prejudice to remove a whole group of people from a country generations down the line was indoctrinated and born into, yes they colonized south Africa, but the children imo have no reason to be punished for that especially with violence. If you dig deep into world history and culture you will find a country who almost always oppressed a group of people in a from of prejudice and borderline racism, this is not a concept that was created by white people, that being said im not justifying or denying our part in what happened with and what is continuing to happen with American racial issues. I'm just basing that anyone CAN be racist and prejudice",

Prejudice is a personal bias, Raism is a personal bias supported by power, influence,  and social institutions that allows you to financially or socially impact that persons opportunities intentionally or unintentionally. \n\nAnyone can be prejudice, insenstive, cruel or otherwise hurtful towards others. I'm not saying that it's any better just that when racist act on their prejudice their actions are tolerated, normalized, and sometimes even celebrated that allows the behavior to be reinforced. We are quick to call out prejudice but calling out racist is a struggle because it's a bias shared by the entire society (thus we are challenging a social norm and not an individual).\n\nPeople can have equal intentions but many racist haven't been held accountable in the same way that most prejudice people are because of social support.\nBeing prejudice less of a bad person and people can be racist while trying to be a good person.I agree we can all do our part to be better people to one another. \n\nWhen we say everyone can be racist it places the minority group on the same level of responsibility for ending racism/their own oppression and certain people use that as an excuse to wash their hands of the issue (neglecting their part). Privilege is the freedom not to think about an issue and those who have a degree of privilege often fight this awareness because not being aware is comfortable. \n\nI want more love in the world and that means loving someone enough to admit when and in what ways they can do better without telling other people they are off the hook.  Not gulity and innocent are different things. We don't need to be angels but being specific is how we are driving home the point that individual actions are part of something much larger and powerful than that one mean person we ran into at the grocery store.",

Systemic racism has obvious limitations placed upon it, but generally speaking, the actual definition of the word is nothing more or less than \"negative feelings towards a person/group based upon their race.\" There are no extra stipulations beyond that.   \n\n\nWhat I think most people mean with the statement is something along the lines of \"Punching down is wrong, but punching up is perfectly okay.\" That is, prejudice against blacks is bad thanks to them being in a more vulnerable position and the fact that individuals will take racism-based insults/treatment towards them more deeply to heart, but that prejudice against whites is harmless for the exact opposite of those reasons.  \n\n\nI don't agree with that though. I'd amend it to \"Punching down is generally worse than punching up, but both are wrong.\"  \n\n\nLet's take two high school students. One is a friendless, withdrawn bullied kid; the other is a popular girl or guy who's always surrounded by friends, loves life, and has no self-esteem issues.  \n\n\nIf you were mean to either one and/or both of them, would the former's feelings be more deeply hurt? Probably. Would being mean to the former be a shittier and crueler thing to do? I'd say so yeah, you're taking a dump on someone who's already miserable and has a shitty life.  \n\n\nBut could you still hurt the latter's feelings? Yes. Maybe nowhere near as profoundly, but you could still upset them and you would still be giving them hurt they wouldn't deserve. They might be more capable of defending themselves thanks to a better sense of self-confidence as well as a wider support network, but that doesn't mean it's okay to force them to defend themselves in the first place.  \n\n\nAnd, likewise, a single instance of racism against blacks (everything else being equal) would cause more pain than a single instance of racism against whites, since we don't have that ugly history which has caused us to feel uncomfortable in our own skin, but the latter is still wrong. Is calling someone a \"cracker\" or a \"boring white guy\" on the same level as insulting blacks for their race, in terms of the emotional pain it causes the victim? Obviously not, no. Is it still wrong and kind of shitty? Beyond a doubt.",

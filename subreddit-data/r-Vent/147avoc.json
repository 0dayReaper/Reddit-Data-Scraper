    "postText": "My husband (27M) &amp; myself (30F) have a one year old daughter and a son due in October. I\u2019ve been a SAHM since she was born and he\u2019s worked. So me &amp; our daughter are glued to the hip. In March he got a traveling job and only home on the weekends and \u201crecently\u201d I\u2019ve noticed he doesn\u2019t have much patience for our daughter when he\u2019s home for 3 days and it doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s trying to learn how to be patient. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s a great loving dad, loves babygirl to death but his childhood and his dad not being around his whole life, even now has definitely impacted how he parents. I grew up with both parents my whole life so we but heads on how to raise her in certain areas. I\u2019ve had to learn how to be patient and everything about parenthood really on my own because he\u2019s always worked so now I\u2019m golden when it comes to her tantrums and calming her down or trying to understand what\u2019s going on with her and whenever I try to explain or give advice, he gets defensive or shuts down when I\u2019m only helping because at one point I didn\u2019t have patience and sometimes my patience wears thin being 5 months pregnant and raising her alone during the week, I swear he thinks just because i don\u2019t leave the house and physically work that it\u2019s supposed to be easy when in fact, parenting is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. It\u2019s a learning process everyday but I just don\u2019t think he will see that ever and the lack of patience and not wanting me to telling him anything or give him some food for thought makes me nervous for our second baby. We don\u2019t have to agree on everything when it comes to our kids, I dont expect him to take my advice and use it every time but just listening and being open minded could go a long way if he tries. If he doesn\u2019t have the patience for one child, I don\u2019t see how he\u2019ll have it enough for 2 kids and especially not being around everyday only makes it harder. Im scared having two kids will be way too overwhelming for him and he\u2019ll just leave like his dad did to his mom",

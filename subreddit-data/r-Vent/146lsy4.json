    "postText": "This rant is going to sound very spoiled, and I apologize for it. This all started years ago when my parents told me that they were planning on building a large home in Africa. I was excited. Every year, I'd ask questions about the progress, and they'd say it's close to being done. When I got to high school and got a job, they began asking for money to help with the house they were still building, and they returned some money to me but not a lot. They'd go to Africa almost yearly to look at the home progress. This year, they actually let me join.them.on their trip here to see the home. Now it's been more than a decade and they told me the house was still incomplete. I saw videos from two years ago and I assumed that there'd be more progress as time went on. Fast forward to yesterday,  I finally arrive at the house to see it is in the same condition as it was two years ago. So far everything is concrete, from the walls to the floors. There is electricity and a few beds luckily but that's about the only good thing about the house. No chairs or tables, the windows all have gaps on holes in them so there are bugs and spiders everywhere, and the second floor hasn't been complete, so there's a stairwell leading no where. There are doors luckily, but they are hard to open.and close, also above the door, there is a space for some glass for some reason but the glass isn't there, so you can hear everything going on in the house. My parents are trying to be optimistic saying that since they are here, the floors will get done tomorrow but honestly I'm disappointed \ud83d\ude15. I have to stay here for another three more days, it's like I'm camping. \nAs of right now I can here \"workers\" doing something, maybe trying to get plumbing,  but being honest with myself, I would like to go back home. \n\nTldr; parents been building a house for more than a decade. I helped fund this project, but after seeing the house for myself, it's just a hollow structure made out of concrete with bugs everywhere.",

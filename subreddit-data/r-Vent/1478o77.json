    "postText": "\n\nim 18 years old. When pandemic ended, I had to go back to school in person. This was my 10th grade year of high school and technically my first year since in freshmen year i was doing online. I thought it would be a good year and i would have friends like in 8th grade. Nope\u2026 My old friends didn\u2019t speak to me at all. I also developed werid tremors in my body and i sometimes shake even more when nervous especially in school. It\u2019s gotten worst in my 11th grade year. \n\nMany people thought i was werid when i did nothing. For some reason i was acting so slow (mentally) too. My old crush most likely spread rumors to everyone as well. The friends i made decided to outcast me and insult me. The same happened in my 11th grade grade. Many kids saw me as the werid quiet kid. I also sometimes had werid movements and i acted socially awkward i was also bullied to my lack of facial expression Many bullied me when they didn\u2019t even know who i was People enjoyed seeing me suffer Ill never forget when ian girl told me body liked me Idk what i did to deserve so much hate \n\nThey all treat me like a villain I been accused of crushing on girls too when i didn\u2019t do anything why am i a easy target on first sight wtf did i do?  i\u2019m so sick and tired of it man idk how long i can go on with this Now i\u2019m gonna be in my senior year. In my 11th grade year i had so many tremors in my head and i shaked a lot for some reason cussing me to be seen even more as werid and creepy. I wish i could start over where people didn\u2019t know me yet but i don\u2019t think i would be able to change anything anyways and i would have to experience it all again. Now everyone has the mindset to hate me Most hate me when they look at me idk what\u2019s wrong with my appearence i need to know it\u2019s killing me this loneliness I\u2019m sick of it. Everyday i have mental breakdowns at home where i break stuff and throw things Im so filled with rage and hate\n\nall my bullies all the people who disrespected me They\u2019re all respected by many of my school everyone loves them while they outcast me and spread rumors",

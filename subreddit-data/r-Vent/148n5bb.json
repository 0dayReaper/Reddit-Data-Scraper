    "postText": "i know the guy since 2017, we had some issues back on the past, we spent months without talking in the past, but we always talked and resolve ourselves. now that we are older, i guess those issues won't happen again. but there is something that really killed me recently.\n\nwe used to play a lot together, stream our games on discord and even played 0% untill 100% of the game and it was so fun to have someone to talk about everything the game had to offer. but guess what? this don't happen anymore. everytime i ask him if he wants to play something, he only answer \"i don't know\", if he wants to watch something \"hum, if i'm not doing anything i can watch\", or even if he wants to stream something \"i don't want to play/don't have anything to show\". and this is going on for some months now and i'm feeling useless, i just wanted to spend time with my friend that is almost a brother but he doesn't seem interested in my company he never ask to do something only me.\n\nand the saddest things, i helped this guy A LOT even if the problem wasn't mine, i didn't like to see him upset. he doesn't work and have a difficult life, so in special occasions i gave him games that he wanted, skins, I DID EVEN HELPED PAYING THE FUCKING INTERNET BILL HE HAD GOD FUCKING DAMMIT HOW STUPID I AM...\n\nand now he uninstalled everything and i'm done, i'm playing alone for weeks so it doesn't even matter. i confronted him about this and all he says is \"that's my way, if you don't like it, you need to find someone else to play. someone that will do everything you want and etc. but i will be here to talk about random stuff\". like, what did i just do to deserve this? i'm just a fucking clown",

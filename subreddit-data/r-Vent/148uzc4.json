    "postText": "My older brother (23m) is autistic. And I am a glass child, if you don\u2019t know what that is, basically someone who has a sibling(s) who have learning disability\u2019s or special needs and  that person is neglected by thier parents because those siblings need more attention. Anyways so because of that my ideas, opinions and genuinely anything I do has been shot down because I\u2019m afraid if I speak my mind to him he\u2019ll just get upset and I don\u2019t know, do something he\u2019ll regret? (My older brother has a history of violence, bad mental health and stuff with the law) so sometimes I\u2019m scared of him, or what he\u2019ll do. I honestly don\u2019t know what do to anymore, my family is so extremely dysfunctional it\u2019s insane, none of our personalities work together, my siblings, mom dad, basically every family member. This sucks and I can\u2019t wait to move on with my life in 4 years.",

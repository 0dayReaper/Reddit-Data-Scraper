    "postText": "Today I was at a BBQ and someone\u2019s mom started crying because a song came on. It was the song she said goodbye to her mom to. \n\nI\u2019m 22(F). I never got to say goodbye to my mom. I was 1 when she died. I miss her and I don\u2019t even remember meeting her. I\u2019m assuming when I met her she was sick. I just wish I could remember. I don\u2019t know who she was as a person. I\u2019ve tried to talk to my dad about it but all he will say is \u201cyeah she was funny\u201d. I want to KNOW her as a person. I wish I could talk to her right now. I have a stepmom and she\u2019s in my life for good. I can\u2019t help but compare her to the mom I don\u2019t know.\n\n I\u2019ve read about how the connection between a mother and daughter is and I wish I had that. I wish I had someone to talk to unconditionally - in a way that a mom and daughter have. I can\u2019t talk to my dad the way I would like to talk to my mom.\n\nI wish I was able to have that experience.",

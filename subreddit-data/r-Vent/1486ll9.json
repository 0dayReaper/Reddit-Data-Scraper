    "postText": "So I have been jobless for 4 months (my old job was paying me less than everyone else because of my disability people who worked less time that me there and started after got paid more) It has been rough finding a job with a disabilty you put you have one and most jobs run. My friend got me a job working with her (and im getting paid 4$ more there). I was told to call in and talk to the person took 2 days to get ahold of them to get my interview that was supposed to be today at 1:30. I was told I had the job I just needed to come in with my stuff and do paperwork for the interview.  While eating breakfast I was sent a text informing me that it was canceled and moved to tomorrow morning at 11am. That's fine. Went bought my pants for work  came home and at 10pm started my showering and getting stuff ready for the next day interview.  While I was getting ready to take my sleeping pills and rewind and watch TV to pass out I got a message  from said friend.  The gm and the hiring manager were not talking to each other one person canceled when the other person didn't want them too.  I was supposed to come in but since i have the job now i have to come in tommrow at 7am  so i had to find my work shoes and get ready to work.  I havent been able to talk to anyone about my disabilty and what i can and can not do due to it. Or the fact that i have to go out of state for 2 days this month or have a court date with people possibly over my husband getting hit by a car.\n\n\nThis is all fine and workable around and i can do it tommrow thats fine. What is not fine is its almost midnight im trying to sleep  my husband is playing a game on his computer volume up loud lights everywhere and talking to his friends on discord.  And he's ignoring me asking him to quiet down. That's to this I will be getting 0 hours of sleep.  And my first day of work will be absolute a mess",

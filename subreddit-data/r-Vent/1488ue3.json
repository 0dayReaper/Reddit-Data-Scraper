    "postText": "I have never in all my years felt so alone than right now. About three years ago my mom abandoned me and I was homeless for six months. In that time my dad was my rock. He loved me, everything about me. Accepted me for who I was and what I wanted to be. He kept me safe and happy and fed. It started summer of last year when he started drinking. At first it was the weekends but it\u2019s gotten to the point where he drinks as soon as he wakes up and as soon as he goes to bed. At this point I have NOBODY in my corner. The day before yesterday he started screaming at me and choked my girlfriend, telling her he wanted to kill her and telling me I\u2019m brainwashed and useless and blind to how evil she is. He called her and me every name in the book- whores, sluts, bitches, liars, cunts , manipulators, all of it. Now he is blowing up my phone blaming us for ruining his life and threatening to hurt himself and long story short I\u2019m sleeping on the side of the road in a camper with my girlfriend. I am so crushed all I can do is sleep or cry. The guilt is eating me alive and I\u2019ve never felt like a worse person. I want to say I was justified in leaving because it was the only option. But man this hurts. I can\u2019t bear this anymore. I have NO FRIENDS NO FAMILY NOWHERE to go. I am sorry for a big long tangent but I\u2019m being eat up.",

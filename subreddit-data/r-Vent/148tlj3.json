My \"friend\" has two vr headsets and told me he would like to give them to me because he knows he broke my old one.\nI have asked for them maybe 4 or 5 times throughout the year. And each time there was always some kind of excuse. And now my \"friend\" is selling them and i asked to at least have one of them since he owed me and he said \"No i need to sell them. \nThe headset i had cost at least $400 plus shipping. He owes me this headset for breaking my other one.",

    "postText": "I am a person that dreams a lot. Like I dream of what I want out of my future. A lot of them are pipe dreams and I understand that, like being a musician, or working in F1, I understand these are ones I would love to be but I understand not being them. But the obtainable ones I have completely lost hope in. I\u2019m a hopeful person too, now I see a post on instagram or tik tok of an account I followed because they posted things with my dreams and I just say to myself \u201cwow that would be nice but it\u2019ll never be me\u201d to the smallest things. Here are a few examples: I really love clouds and want to get into cloud photography but the iPhone camera isn\u2019t enough and I feel if I bought a good camera for it I would shame myself for spending so much money, and I would never actually take pictures of clouds. I also really love mountains, I see posts of people hiking or having a vacation at the mountains and I cannot ever see myself being there. I have dreamt for so long of going and idk, I just have no hope that I\u2019ll get there. Idk if it\u2019a me coping with the fact that if I do do it, it will be years from now or that I\u2019ve just lost hope for my future in general. Everything is just so complicated I feel I can\u2019t make decisions on my own, and that\u2019s probably why too. Thanks for letting me rant and thanks for reading whoever read this, I hope you\u2019re doing well in life, you deserve it.",

They're watching, they're mocking, they're going to take me away. I'M SCARED. I'm scared. I want this to stop, I don't want to be delusional\nMy delusions affect my friends as much as they affect me. I'm loosing friends, I'm loosing people in my life that I love so much. But, some of them never loved me, I know it, I just feel it in my gut. They're all just lying, spreading rumors. They're watching, they're going to take me away. I'm scared and I hate this. I hate my life. I want this to stop. I hate myself, I hate myself for believing such stupid stuff, for believing shit that isn't real and could never be real. I hate this, I just want this to stop. I want it to stop so much. It hurts, it's scary. Why must I be the one to go though this!? it sucks, it's the worst. I hate this, I hate myself and I hate my life. I hate this so much. Why me!? Why me!? What did I ever do!? I never deserved this, I don't deserve this. I was just a child, I am just a child. I'm a teenager. I'm just a teenager. Why me, why me!? I want this to stop, I want to go go away",

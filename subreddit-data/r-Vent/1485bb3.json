    "postText": "Im a very paranoid type of person to the point I get scared by being outside cause my mind is thinking of all possibilities I could die. It has calmed down for a while but now I have something to look forward to next year but im so so scared I\u2019ll die before it happens. Im kinda scared to go to sleep but I\u2019m going to anyways. I know it\u2019s silly and irrational but just want to get it off my chest since it\u2019s been  bothering me for the past four days. If anyone goes thru this and have tips to calm down could you please provide? Thanks",

    "postText": "I(18) still live with my parents bc I just graduated high school.  For the past 1.5 years I\u2019ve been reading the Satanic Bible off and on, sometimes going weeks without picking it up bc I have ADHD and motivation just wasn\u2019t there to do anything.  Today, my mom found it and, like the title says, she threw it away.  I bought that book with my own money yet she thinks she has a right to throw it away.    She\u2019s not Christian(or so she claims) but she was angered by the fact that I have it.  I haven\u2019t told her I\u2019m a Satanist, but I\u2019m just pissed at this.  This might not be the right channel for this, but I just need to get that out there.\n\nUpdate:  I stole my book back and my dad is fine with me having it.  My dad has my back.",

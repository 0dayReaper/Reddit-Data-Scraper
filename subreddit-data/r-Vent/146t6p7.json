    "postText": "i feel so pathetic lmao\n\nyesterday i finished day 2 of my first job at a gas station (i was too busy in high school to get one and i just graduated from high school a week ago). im not even really doing anything im just supposed to do all the online training shit on the computer. but thats the thing. nobody was assigned to train me. all the computer shit isnt helping me learn how to do my job. the manager is on maternity leave and the owner of the store hasnt been here since i started. im too afraid to ask my coworkers anything because all of them are twice my age at the youngest.\n\ni just wanted to prove myself i could do this by myself. i applied without telling anybody, did the interview and onboarding paperwork without any help and i was proud of that. now i honestly wish i never did any of it. ive cried every single day since they told me my starting day (thankfully not on the job) and its frustrating the fuck out of me. i would rather my mom be disappointed that im an unemployed no life than be proud of me for getting a job that i hate. and i know its only been 2 days and i should give it some more time but is it really supposed to be this bad?? am i overreacting?",

            "comment": "The feeling of not knowing what you're doing when starting a job for the first time is entirely normal. They're supposed to have someone train you, so if they're not, that's on them. That does mean, however, that you'll need to try your best to work with what you have. Ask for help. Whether they're annoyed with you or not (hopefully not), that's their job.",

I work from home and work is chill so it's a lot more manageable.\n\nDon't let this experience stress you out. Fast food, gas station, grocery market jobs are all a lot more physically and emotionally stressful than a lot of jobs out there. Ironically, they also pay the least. \n\nAlso, don't be afraid to ask questions. Co-workers know that you're new. The most foolish things is trying to seem perfect when you're not. People see through it. It's all in your head. 99% of people will be cool with it. If they're not then they have issues.\n\nI'd expect that the first year or so is just an experience for you to learn on the job. It's not about being a perfect employee. If you don't get fired within a few months up to a year then you've survived a gas station, which means you can handle way more jobs since customer service jobs like that suck.\n\nIf anything, you're admirable for applying yourself. Keep it up!",

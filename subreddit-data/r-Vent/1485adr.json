    "postText": "Last year i was in a very bad place. I really thought I was trans. Now i dont really think so anymore but everyone on the internet was just supporting me without even knowing and I was so mad at my parents for not believing me. I started ranting about them on the internt. And oh i feel so guilty. I deleted all posts on herr and i deleted my old accounts but still i am such a bad person i can never feel happy again in my life. I wish I could delete the entire last year from existence. On days like today i wake up sweating knowing what I did. Social media was a mistake. A big one and me the Fool, der Narr, il pazzo i fell for it. I know that you wont understand and I hope noone in my family will be ever able tofind my deleted posts. But i hereby ask for forgiveness. Forgiveness from the same platform it all started on. I have grown as a person and I love my parents I love them so much and what I did is wrong and unfair i was a stupid teenager with too much unsupervised access to the internet and with no shame to blame everything on someone else. \n\n\nIf my parents ever read this: \n\nMama, Papa, ich hab euch unfassbar lieb und alles was ich getan habe war falsch und ihr k\u00f6nnt mir bestimmt niemals richtig verzeihen. Es tut mir so leid.",

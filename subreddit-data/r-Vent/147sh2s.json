Don\u2019t panic and make any decisions you\u2019ll regret later in life. You\u2019re young and have plenty of time to explore your sexuality. \n\nI\u2019m from a strict Guatemalan/Cuban household and my mom was very religious. Of course everyone likes to come out right away these days, but it was really fun hiding it for a while. My mom thought my ex gf was my best friend and let her sleep over, shop, and come to church with us. Nothing wrong with liking women at all. They\u2019re beautiful, interesting, and literally a work of art. At the end of the day, you like what you like and no one can take that from you. Feminine or not, you\u2019re still you.",

I'll not go into details because folks never like to hear about the hard life and downsides of being a male.  \n\nyou are a woman who likes women.  thats fine.  it's who you are, right now, and maybe forever.  concentrate on solving the problem of existing where you are and finding love and fulfillment in life.  thats what your struggle is now.  you are living in a fantasy world.  being a man doesn't solve problems - it gives you new ones that i think you may even like less.",

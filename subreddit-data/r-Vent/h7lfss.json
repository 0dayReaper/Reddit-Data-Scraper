In a private setting, though, there's absolutely no reason to even bring it up. \n\nI have the reverse problem, not with laughter, but when somebody talks to me I adapt to their way of talking. I've literally been walking down the street and talking one dialect to the person on my left and another dialect to the person on my right, it weirded them out. Worst moment was on my bestie's birthday party when her boyfriend asked me to imitate his dialect because \"You can do it so well\". That mortified me, what if he thought I was mocking him?! It's not a conscious thing, it just happens.",

It\u2019s obviously in bad taste and you better know how the person will receive that gesture.\n\nThat being said, hear me out: I work as part of a sales team. For work, my team mates and I all collectively socialize with some couple of thousand people daily.\n\nI want to share a few things I\u2019ve learned by interacting with so many different people daily and hope they\u2019re useful to you:\n\n1) Every person has a peculiar perspective. Jack notices your hair, Brian sees your nose, Andy sees your laugh.\n\nThere\u2019s your hands, your lisp, your weight, your ideas, your facial hair, your skin, your ethnicity, your sexuality, your self confidence, expressions, likeness to someone or something, eye color, smell, legal status, personality, accent, mood, disabilities, educational level, hair color, clothes, agenda, religion, skin color, etc...\n\nYou might not think that person\u2019s observation is a real reflection of who you are, but it\u2019s still real whether someone acknowledges it or not (and specially regardless of whether YOU want it acknowledged or not).\n\nWith all these different aspects of your identity being equally real at all times, it can only matter to the extent that you want to let it matter.\n\nI\u2019ve met people from all over the world, and with different combinations of these characteristics. I rarely find any of these get in the way of us understanding each other, cooperating, and getting the job done.\n\n2) By and and large, people\u2019s opinions and impressions don\u2019t matter. They really don\u2019t. You can let them ruin your day (and they might), or you can go beyond them. You should use them at your leisure, and acknowledge them only as you find it useful, because they\u2019re more plentiful than a snowflake in a blizzard, and about as relevant.\n\nOh, this person thinks you have a really ugly or peculiar laugh? Who cares? I certainly don\u2019t recommend you let their impressions be a whole handle for them to dictate your mood, and certainly not an edge for them to bully you.\n\n3) Whatever you think you heard, only (maaaaaaybe) a fifth of what they actually meant really got through.\n\nYou can\u2019t read their mind. You\u2019re speculating what they\u2019re intentions were.\n\nPeople are bad at expressing themselves, emotionally crass, verbally limited, and completely self absorbed fickle monkeys who will do one thing if they woke up in one mood and do the complete opposite if they woke up in a different mood.\n\nYou\u2019re really going to let your impression of their impression tell you what matters? Who you are?\n\nNah, man. Keep trucking. On to the next thing.\n\nThat\u2019s just me though. As the old saying goes: You do you.",

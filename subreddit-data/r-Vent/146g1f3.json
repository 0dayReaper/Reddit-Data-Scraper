    "postText": "Me and my ex wife have be divorced for almost 3 years, she\u2019s been with her new guy for close to a year not sure exactly. For the last six months both my boys have came over to my house crying to me that their mom doesn\u2019t spend enough time with them when their at her house and she\u2019ll play video games over playing with them or lay in bed and yell at them if they come in her room. So I\u2019ve brought up to her when the boys first came to me almost six months ago that she needed to spend more time with the kids and play with them, it work for maybe a week or two then the boys complaining again. Things proceed to just get worse the past few months with her giving up her time with the kids for her bf, him telling her to ignore me when I\u2019m calling for important phone calls about the kids, her taking vacations after vacation with him then she\u2019ll complain she has no money or vacation time to do anything with the kids, her threatening to take my time away during the weekdays with them cause I work nights and to her \u201cI don\u2019t even see\u201d even though I hang out with them for 2-3 1/2 hours before going to work and that\u2019s exactly how much time she spends with them before putting them to bed during the week.she knows doing that to me would put me in a really tough spot with money cause I fought to get my extra two days during the week just so I could breathe with all the bills plus child support. And now today my older son who\u2019s 7 was having a bit of a rough day so I wanted to have a phone call with her and my son about his behavior and how he\u2019s been treating his brother and others today since we don\u2019t get many conversations all of us together anymore and she ignores first call then I text her can we talk please it\u2019s important, she proceeds to instantly decline three calls so I asked texted her again asking to answer please, she then text back he told me to ignore contact my grandpa or mom if you need anything I\u2019m not talking to you till it\u2019s time to put them to bed tonight. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to co parent with\ud83d\ude05",

    "postText": "Debatably, everyone is entitled to a basic level of respect and decency. That\u2019s why I respect pronouns, because I feel everyone is entitled to basic respect and decency until they prove to me otherwise. What you aren\u2019t entitled to however, is attraction. That\u2019s something you have no right to demand from anyone. You\u2019re taking decent people who are supportive of your cause, and telling them they are transphobic because they don\u2019t want to have sex you. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s \u201c*biting the hand that feeds you*\u201d exactly, but you get my point. It\u2019s really not helping the cause. I haven\u2019t let these comments effect my views because I know not all trans people feel that way, but still. If you can\u2019t respect my boundaries, I\u2019m not going to respect your pronouns.\n\nBefore anyone says \u201c*no one\u2019s saying it is*\u201d, i\u2019ve seen this thought process voiced a lot, especially on Reddit. In fact this post was prompted by comments regarding/voicing it.",

Sex is something  that is personal, it is the most intimate you can be with someone. People have the right to be as selective as they wish to be regarding who they have sex with. As long as you aren\u2019t spouting bigotry and demanding they have no rights then who you share your genitals with is entirely your choice and no one has the right to tell you it\u2019s wrong.",

For example, a straight woman wouldn't date a trans man who has a vagina because she likes male genitalia. Some straight people don't have a genital preference btw, you can be a straight woman in the sense that you like MEN as in the gender, but not necessarily only male genitalia, which refers to sex and not gender. Some people also prefer biological men/women and feel weird with someone who's *biologically* in between. So I think this kind of instances are absolutely not transphobic. That's what people are talking about when they say not being attracted to trans people isn't transphobic.\n\nBut, *sexuality* aside, there are also people who wouldn't date a trans person not because of their genitalia or gender or biology, but because they are simply *transgender* and they don't like transgender people. *That* is transphobic. Their sexuality isn't what prevents them from being attracted to trans people, their bigotry is.",

Let\u2019s say you couldn\u2019t tell whether it was someone who was born that way or had surgery. But you\u2019re attracted.\n\nIt\u2019s only when you find out the truth that the person is trans that you lose your attraction. So you\u2019re sexually attracted but not psychologically attracted. That\u2019s a mental block because it\u2019s something you\u2019ve now learned that\u2019s a dealbreaker for you.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to be sexually attracted to someone and also not want them. And that\u2019s confusing for people. It\u2019s one of the main reasons trans women are at risk for violence because the man discovers that he\u2019s been \u201ctricked\u201d but because he\u2019s still sexually attracted he can\u2019t cope with that confusion and lashes out. \n\nSo to answer your question it\u2019s only transphobic when you treat the info a certain way. Otherwise it\u2019s just a mental block. And that\u2019s ok.",

It\u2019s not wrong if you\u2019re not attracted and choose to unmatch, but half the time I just get  cussed out and get called some pretty horrendous slurs for \u201ctricking\u201d dudes. \n\nKeep in mind; They swiped right on me first. They were most likely just spamming right swipes without any reading at all. If you read my profile I am EXTREMELY transparent about my transgender status, it\u2019s in my profile in 3 places. Why is it my fault you swiped? \n\nYou can reject politely or not message at all and unmatch, that\u2019s 100% fine I don\u2019t expect everyone to be ok with it. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to treat me like my only value was if I have a vagina or not. \n\nPlease understand I\u2019m not at all assuming anything about you personally, but the kind of guys I\u2019ve met who complain about \u201cdon\u2019t expect attraction\u201d are unusually cruel in apps when they realize I\u2019m trans. you can reject without being aggressive. \n\nYou could be a nice person, don\u2019t get me wrong im not accusing you of anything.

Normally it dies down if you set your age range a little higher but being trans is a unique ballgame so that may or may not help your cause.

In their 20's your only appeal for many is your vagina and if you don't have one or don't want to allow them use of it, you're trash. \n\nHope you find someone who isn't an ass.",

That\u2019s not sexually attractive to a lot of people. But for trans people who pass, and you can\u2019t tell, it\u2019s 100% disingenuous to claim you could never be sexually attracted. I would go so far as to say I am sure you have been and never knew. \n\n2) lifestyle preference. Sexual attraction is designed to make us procreate. It\u2019s not the only reason to be with a partner but if you\u2019re heterosexual you are hardwired this way. Even if you\u2019re gay you\u2019re hardwired this way. Plenty of people leave partners because of differences in ability or willingness to procreate, trans or not and regardless of sexual orientation. Whereas you don\u2019t really get to choose who you are sexually attracted to you have a lot more choice on this second aspect of procreation.\n\nIn neither circumstance is transphobia a factor.\n\nIs it possible to then, despite the above, be transphobic? Absolutely. This means seeing trans people as less than. Not worthy. To be ignored or tolerated (or on the worst end of the spectrum not tolerated at all). \n\nI can completely understand the hurt that \u201cI don\u2019t want to date trans\u201d can cause even when someone is not transphobic. It\u2019s an absolute and too simplistic a way to describe that it\u2019s just not a lifestyle / life state that you want to deal with for you and that\u2019s ok. But that\u2019s harder to say.",

Gotta say though I\u2019m having a real issue with the \u201cif you can\u2019t respect my boundaries, I\u2019m not going to respect your pronouns\u201d statement. I realize you\u2019re upset but revoking your \u201crespect\u201d in these circumstances is saying that you never had any in the first place because weaponizing this sort of thing shows how performative it is coming from you. It\u2019s very much like using a gendered or racial slur when you\u2019re angry while maintaining you\u2019re not sexist or racist. It\u2019s just not cool and it says a lot about you imo. I don\u2019t care who you sleep with but call people by their correct pronouns.",

I have no problem with pronouns etc. No problem whatsoever in any way with people who are trans or neutral or whatever. Don't care. As long they love it's fine.\n\nBut Wokeism \n\nWhich is religious in nature because they are extreme and they no longer seem to see when they are just plain wrong and attacking people for wrong reasons. Because they are so so focused and narrow in mind on social justice that they see injustice where there is none. To the point where you are no the one who is been getting the injustice and they don't see it. This is like burning witches because they are female.\n\nThis can be bad. It has to be watched vigilantly.\n\nThis is the result from having no religion and being atheist I think \n\nWhich is fine. Since I'm Atheist and open to proof. But they should really be aware of their extremism and in other words be aware of their bias towards exaggerating and seeing thing s though a lens that creates everything as being the lens they watch through. Injustice.\nTake of the fucking lens. And add nuance . Purposefully watch the other side and not to bash them but to balance your own extreme.\n\nI have had to do that as well. To make sure you're not going towards extreme where you don't see clearly anymore you have to purposefully look for the other sides opinion in order to put yourself back a little more to the center. Where balance lies and actual insight.",

Are you saying that islam,judaism and christianity are invalid simply because they dont wanna stick their dicks in that? I woild argue that your being \"religiou-phobic\" or whatever.\n\nI dont have anythjng against trans people. But this forcing of ideology is WHY theres transphobia.",

Can't do that with any type of surgery in existence right now. The fact you said physically the same as a cis person is factually wrong even on the most basic level. This is beyond human capabilities to do. It's the best we can do at the moment with surgical intervention but it's never even been advertised as the same as a born with set of jibbly bits. Also the surgery is for the patient not other people, it is the person who underwent the surgery to be happy with, not others.",

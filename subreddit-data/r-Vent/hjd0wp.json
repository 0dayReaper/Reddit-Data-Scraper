    "postText": "A little over a year ago I was almost sexually assaulted by a girl that I was dating. She was on top of me and wanted me to finish inside her. I was not wearing protection at the time. We agreed that if I\u2019m on the verge of finishing that she would climb off. Later that day she texted me saying that she considered not getting off and have me finish inside her. When someone doesn\u2019t give you consent and you do it anyways that is called sexual assault. Doesn\u2019t matter what gender you are. For those who call men gay for sharing their story you can fuck off. You are just as bad as the abuser.\n\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all for reading and the support and thank you to those who shared their stories. Much respect to all of you.",

Those women CAN be rapists and sexual abusers. And especially, women adults who have sex with minors are not \u201ccougars\u201d or the young boy is not lucky, he was raped and she is a PEDOPHILE.",

She kept coaxing me and when I didn\u2019t want to, and really wanted to go back to her house, she eventually pushed my to a tree because she wanted it, I didn\u2019t. I was very docile, very submissive and didn\u2019t know how to speak up for myself or stand up for myself at the time. My parents raised me that way and my ex was an abuser of that because she had the same parents, and basically treated me like my parents and her parents did her. It\u2019s so painful to remember and it\u2019s hard to explain to people that I was touched, and I was assaulted as a man. Even writing this makes me want to tear up. I get anxiety getting near her road in my town and I don\u2019t drive there if I can avoid it. Thank you so much for recognizing our pain. We get assaulted just like women do and no one speaks on it that I know of. \n\nEdit: TLDR: My parents taught me my voice didn\u2019t matter and created self doubt and a lack of confidence; I found someone just as broken, they were violent rather than docile like I was, so she took advantage at my lack of self confidence to fight back, she forced me to have sex with her when I refused.",

You literally enjoyed and consented to the sex, you just didn\u2019t enjoy the possibility of an outcome you wouldn\u2019t like, not wearing a condom was your choice and literally opens the gateway to a child. That was your only problem with the sex, that she considered not getting off top and y\u2019all walked away with a child, even if your pullout game is strong it\u2019s not 100% protection from a child, next time just don\u2019t be a dumbass. \n\nIt\u2019s like a girl telling her boyfriend not to wear a condom and then getting upset that that may have resulted in a child had he not been able to pull out on time. Be upset. Be frustrated . Be annoyed. But do not take your choices and pin it on your partner as sexual assault.  An unwanted pregnancy during consensual sex is NOT sexual assault.\n\nAnd then to also ignore that in the middle of sex some times it literally feels too good and , as a man you may forget to pull out, or as a woman it may feel too good for you to get off, both for a number of reasons. \n\nI also don\u2019t think she texted you to say \u201chey I almost forced you to impregnate me\u201d , I really think she was trying to say it in a sexy way like \u201cdamn your dick was so good I almost couldn\u2019t resist it\u201d but your uptight ass can\u2019t see that. \n\nLastly, if you\u2019re so fucking scared of having a child then how about you don\u2019t be a dumbass and put it in the control of someone else, WEAR A CONDOM and I promise all your worries will go away, and if you\u2019re not old enough to handle the responsibility of a child then you shouldn\u2019t be having sex without one.",

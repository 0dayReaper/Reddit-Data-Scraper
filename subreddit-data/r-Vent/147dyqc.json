    "postText": "I (then 24m) was recently out of a relationship, and I met this woman (20F) through mutual friends. She lived pretty far away from my city with her parents, and was travelling in a lot. We hit it off. We talked about dating, I considered it then I decided not to because I was fresh from a relationship. \n\nA few months later she needed somewhere to crash. So I let her sleep on my couch. We were literally just friends. She slept on my couch like 5 weekends. She came to and said that her autism was making thing hard and she needed something permanent. So I said if she got a job in the city and could afford a portion of the rent I would be okay her moving in properly. \n\nLike a day later she says she has a job, and is moving in. I say okay. She moved in. \n\nThe first week she said that she needed her essential oils as a sensory comfort thing. Then it got bad the scents of flowers were so strong I started get headaches. I told her she needed to stop because it was so bad. Then I realised she was using it to cover smoking inside. \n\nThen the next week she \u201chad cancer\u201d the she didn\u2019t know if she was going to live for 1 week or 10 years. I have a friend who is a cancer doctor, they met when I had friends over. My dr friend say she was lying. Apparently she had said a bunch of stuff that made no sense. Then she tried to manipulate the doctor friend into explaining to how it works. My doctor friend said that it was like she was practicing the way my friend talked about cancer.\n\nAt the same party she started telling my friends that I had been telling them not to talk to her. They were confused. She also told them that I had started bringing home older women because I know she had a thing for older women. I literally hooked up with a 28 year old once, and she over heard me saying it on the phone.\n\nThen she became a sex worker. Like literally one evening she burst into my room and said I\u2019m a sex worker now. She worked in a brothel. I was getting scared because she would come in at night and if she didn\u2019t have any men pick her she would scream about how men a dogs and she wanted to stab them all.\n\nI had a phone conversation with a friend saying that she needed to go.\n the next day she came in my room at like 8am saying in a weeks time she had cancer treatment. After that she shaved her head.\n\nShe left all her stuff and disappeared for like two months. Then I saw her socials apparently she was in a homeless shelter. She was pretending to do drugs, like posting pictures with syringes pressed into her arm with out needles attached. Or like forget if she was high or drunk so she would post, so she would act really drunk then switch to like hulucating. \n\nThen one of my friends came to my house and said this woman had contacted him and needed to get medical documentation for cancer stuff. So he went into her room, and pulled out a form. It was a regular blood test form. She told him that\u2019s what proved she had cancer. It wasn\u2019t filled out yet \n\nSo I didn\u2019t see her for six months then like 4 days ago I was sent a link to her socials that had a go fund me. \n\nShe said that due to a toxic relationship she had be forced into sex work. And the that lead to drug use and homelessness.",

    "postText": "I get so fucking sick of seeing my grandfather waste away because he chooses to sit in on his recliner 14/15 hours a day downing his whiskey and cokes like nothing. I promise you I\u2019m not being a dick he is capable of walking short distances but he won\u2019t even go outside on the porch, just to hear the birds and see the squirrels, get some fresh air. he has a good pickup to get around but he doesn\u2019t use it ever. He\u2019s fucking depressed man and I don\u2019t know what to do about it. He lost his wife and my grandma in March and since her funeral he\u2019s left the house 1-2 times to see doctors. If he gets drunk enough he starts on about how his life is over he\u2019s got nothing and if \u201cI did myself it wouldn\u2019t make a shit.\u201d Everytime I try talking to him about it he just gets pissed off and says you need to knock it off and \u201cI\u2019m in so much damn pain\u201d. Which he is, but it\u2019s not a reason to stop living and sit around waiting to die. If he wanted to I\u2019d be delighted to get him the wheelchair and take him around. Earlier this evening he asked me to make him a batch of salsa, and I said no how about you come help me make it, it does you a lot of good when you get on your feet. Despite admitting I was right he wouldn\u2019t, I started tearing up and I said it\u2019s just the onions but that was a damn lie. It\u2019s so depressing because I remember being little and he would push me up and down the street on this tractor toy and he would always come by my house to play with me, now he just sits there with his whiskey. What do I do?",

It\u2019s not a pretty death. Many of them die painfully over the course of months as their bad habits catch up to them. End-stage liver, kidney, and heart failure are no joke.  It\u2019s a reality no one wants to acknowledge or talk about but happens every single day. \n\n\nIt\u2019s important you realize he is a grown man, an adult, and you are not responsible for him. That being said, if you have the emotional/mental energy, simply just talking to him and being around him is helping him. If he\u2019s willing, even just meeting with other people (who\u2019ve also lost their spouses) in a support group could very much benefit him. Therapy might help. Some medications that can control depression and anxiety may help. But he is not going to make any changes unless he wants to make changes. \n\n\nI am trying to think of practical things you can do to help him. If your parents/other relatives have a good relationship with him, I would let them know what\u2019s going on. You can be vague. Say he\u2019s really been down and needs help. Does he have old buddies or neighbors? That could also be a good place to start. With some older men, they will die before they go to therapy, but they\u2019re willing to talk to their old friends and it can really help them turn the corner.",

He doesn\u2019t have many friends but he does talk to his brothers and sister on the phone sometimes. He\u2019s very old fashioned, wouldn\u2019t be open to therapy or support groups. And I highly doubt he will take depression medication it and besides that it would probably interfere with some of his 20 other medications.",

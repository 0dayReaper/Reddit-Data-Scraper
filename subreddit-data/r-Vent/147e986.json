    "postText": "I (15 F) just moved halfway across the country. I really love where I moved to, I really do, more than where I used to live. I just have started to feel the overwhelming sense of being alone. I have the most amazing best friends I could have ever prayed for, they are my sunshine in life, but my best friend got into a lot of trouble and got her phone taken, now we could still ft for a while until she got in trouble AGAIN. She alos just went through some pretty traumatic stuff and I don\u2019t need to put my burdens on her as well. I have other really close friends but I hate being a burden to people and brining there happiness down. For example The other day I was on a call with both of my best friends and they were at a sleepover together, they were laughing and giggling and it just made me think of the times when I was with them and the entire time I was on the call with them I was silently sobbing in the background. I wanted to talk about how much I was hurting with them at that point but I didn\u2019t want to bring their happy spirits down. I haven\u2019t met anyone here yet and honestly I\u2019m super scared to for some reason. I\u2019m usually so bubbly and outgoing but I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m so scared. I don\u2019t want my friends back home to forget about me. I just pray that there will be 1 person that wakes into my life soon, just one.",

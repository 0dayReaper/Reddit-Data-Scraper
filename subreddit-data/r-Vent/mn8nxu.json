    "postText": "i took the ACT recently and got a 33. for the uninitiated, the ACT is scored out of 36, and i think average is 18. a score of 33 puts me at the 99% percentile, meaning that i did better on that test than 99% of my peers. \n\nso i come home and say \"i got a 33 on the ACT!\" cause hey, even though I hate standardized testing and everything it stands for, i'm actually pretty happy that i did that well\n\nand my mom immediately starts talking about how i should start studying the section that i did worst on, so i can retake the test in June and improve my score\n\ni am. so tired. i just wanted her to be proud of me. i did really well but it's not good enough",

            "comment": "Wtf? a 33 Act score can easily get you into honors programs for college straight out of highschool + grants and extra scholarship money if you apply for it. She\u2019s just being a \u201cmom\u201d and probably doesn\u2019t realize how insanely good that score is. Maybe she\u2019s being a little overprotective, maybe she\u2019s a little miserable and unintentionally lectured you so you wouldn\u2019t get a big head. Idk, It sucks that she\u2019s not sharing your excitement but maybe she was just in a bad mood or something. We\u2019re all human and make mistakes, I\u2019m 100% certain that even though she is a little strict on you, there\u2019s absolutely no way she\u2019s not proud that you scored so high. Will definitely be bragging to her coworkers if any of them bring up their kids scores (which 9/10 won\u2019t be anywhere near yours. I made a 22 and have one of the highest act scores out of everybody i talk to)",

She'll still tell me I should lose some weight, but I can brush it off easily now whereas when I was growing up it felt like her love was conditional on my looks. \n\nI imagine it's a bit the same for you, it feels like love is conditional on grades. It's not. You are worthy and loved. \n\nCelebrate your own achievements. Love who you are. Acknowledge that your mums issues with perfection make it hard for her to fully understand your achievements. It will get easier. \n\nI hope you get all the college offers you want. Xx",

It's mostly because they don't get that you also need a carrot, for those who don't understand the allegory, education is meant to have both punishments and rewards, but it's way easier to deliver punishment rather than rewards so many people fail to understand that rewards, are actually more important than the punishment.\n\nYou probably already know this but, your parents love you, probably why they care about your education to the point they want you to improve a nearly perfect score, they just have no idea how to properly educate you and guide you in life ( This part of parenting is the hard one, anyone can tell their children to become a doctor or a lawyer, but not many parents know how to make their children WANT to become a doctor ) . If I were you, I would look approbation somewhere else. Or at the very least don't expect them from them.",

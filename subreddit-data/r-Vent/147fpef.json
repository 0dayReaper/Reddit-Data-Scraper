    "postText": "I dont know where to write this but here might be it. my older brother who is around 21 has low functioning autism aswell as behavioral problems. My brother's anger/aggression problems started around 2020 and has been seeing doctors and has been on medication for years. However, recently the aggression has started to come back and its becoming very concerning. He physically hurts my parents by pinching, scratching and hitting them. As well as on my self or any other family members. Both my mom and dad are unemployed too, because of having to look after my brother 24/7. My hope in my family recovering from all this trauma my brother has caused seems impossible to reach. My brain knows that it isn't his fault for acting like this. But at the same time I dont know how much more i can see this happening. I am constantly frightened and anxious about my parents getting hurt by him, especially my mother. Hearing her cry every other night because of how hurtful my brother can be absolutely breaks my soul. I wish there was more I could do. finding support for him feels very difficult too. Not having the money to afford professional therapists or education for him to have. Being south asian immigrants as well. Im so afraid of seeing my mom's health weaken from all of this. I truly hate my brother and it hurts me to even think that way. We have been struggling for 3 years and it feels like it will only get worse. We are completely relying on prayers and the work of his medication.",

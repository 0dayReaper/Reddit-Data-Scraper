    "postText": "Maybe it\u2019s appropriate to add a trigger warning, maybe not, but I must get this off my chest. I made this account to indulge myself fully into my most primal of sexual thought / activity, I\u2019m starting to feel bad that I am developing a secret life. Prior to this account, I was super holy, Bible thumping Christian zealot which I still believe in Christ and I cannot profess that I have denounced my faith but my sexual desires have been so extremely powerful lately. I may delete this account and gain some self control. I am a heterosexual male by the way.",

I didnt said anything to them. After that i received weird look from woman sitting near who heard them. I felt judged by everyone in the vicinity.",

At least they said *nice* hairy legs. \nIt's not a huge deal, children are idiots who have little original thoughts nor choice than to mimic their adult influence.\n\nFun fact, Sikh women do not shave, tweeze, or cut any of the hair on their bodies. Men even carry a ceremonial dagger so they can't be forced to. The Sikhs are for social justice, their turbans are beacons of unity. It's a pretty neat religion, very much into social justice and equality. Be proud of your hair!",

People at this age (12-16) are usually like this because that\u2019s the time where your social skills and social info about edequitte and norms start to change and improve. Improve, like, to adapt to what what they see. They saw their mom saying that hairy legs are bad?? They\u2019re gonna remember that and keep it in their brain and the social place of their brain. \n\nDon\u2019t be sad. People always just put what\u2019s in their head from history and stuff and say it so that they are in the social norms. Or something like that. I\u2019m too tired to explain but don\u2019t be sad because people are bad. There\u2019s a lot of bad people. I don\u2019t think I have that much body hair or it\u2019s not growing as much on my arms and legs but even if there\u2019s a little people are gonna make fun of it. It\u2019s weird.",

Anyway, the point is, it only matters because you're female, it's a major double standard. And, it only bothers you because you're female. Until you learn to not let it bother you, this kind of behaviour will continue. Once 14 yr old boys learn that it doesn't bother girls, they'll cease saying this. How long that takes? Nobody really knows. Until then you have a choice...don't shave legs and live with these comments, or do shave legs and don't. One thing is for sure, you can't control anyone outside of yourself.",

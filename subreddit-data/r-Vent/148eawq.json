Because they didn\u2019t choose to be more involved or do something themselves, it\u2019s me who\u2019s to blame.\n\nWhen you say you will treat me better and be better and we will grow together, i feel hopeful. \nbut it\u2019s a short lived feeling\n\nim trying my best. \nmy best doesn\u2019t ever seem like enough. \ni feel so stuck in this shitty stage of life where im constantly having to do more and more.\ni feel like i can never just breath. \nim so tired of this.",

            "comment": "Coming from the other perspective because it's always helpful to look at both sides. \n\nAre you careless or irresponsible and possibly there are legitimate feelings of hurt or frustration on their part? And when you raise your concerns with your person is it only when you're in the midst of an argument about something they were already upset about?\n\nI ask because I experienced this with my husband. He would insist on taking things on and told me I would make him feel less manly if I didn't but, he wouldn't handle those things well or wouldnt do them at all and I was always left dealing with the aftermath. And when I would express my frustration or disappointment he would then get defensive and say I was demeaning him. This would turn into me feeling like I wasn't allowed to be disappointed or frustrated and ultimately led to a lot of fights with both of us acting out at eachother. \n\nIt's something to think about. \n\nHowever, I will also stress that it's a two way street for sure. It sounds like you and your partner might benefit from counseling to work on your communication and issues. And im sure, if you put in the effort, it will be worth it. \n\nIt would have been had my husband committed to this when he had the chance. \n\nHope you get some peace and grow together.",

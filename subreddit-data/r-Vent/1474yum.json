    "postText": "I\u2019ve always been one to be kind and be genuine to everyone, and show people that there\u2019s still a bit of humanity in people out there. \nFor example: during work, if I ask a coworker of a favor, or anything else; i make it a point to just acknowledge my appreciation for them. A simple little \u201cthank you, you\u2019re great\u201d, or \u201cthanks, I appreciate you!\u201d. I mean, it makes me feel a sense of contentment for me, because almost always I\u2019m able to see in their actions, or made them feel good, or they needed it; and other encounters we always have through the days. I mean, a few little words make such a big difference with everything. We always feel the respect and enjoyment we reciprocate for each other. They even voice how i am appreciated too. If there\u2019s anything a coworker needs help with or asks me, etc. i do it in a heart beat. Employment business\u2019 and employers are only ever money 24/7 and jobs now always feel, and treat everybody, and everything like machines.. I mean that plays a huge part in many being unable to keep let alone bring in any staff\u2026 and if you work well, you\u2019re over worker constantly to the point; great employees are quitting. Then it stays understaffed and the rest that are there still get everything loaded on them too. \nPeople want to be treated like actual people. They want to hear how great they are. \nI really hate when seeing all this through work, and I hate knowing how these coworkers feel and understand fully every time they get fed up, they have no choice but to leave. For them! So ya, I\u2019ll always be that person for everyone. I mean, the energy between us is personable and good. Those are my people. I am are on the side of being an introvert. But been told I\u2019m and extroverted introvert.. I guess I just make it a point to give that energy of genuine human connection and respect and all else. I truly try to talk to just about everyone in the facility I work in, and they all pretty pretty much know me, I get along with everyone. I\u2019ll stop at the nurses stations here and throughout the day for a minute or so and just talk to them. Aks them how their days been going, laugh and stupid stuff with all of them and then go about what I was doing. - I\u2019ll walk down the halls that I\u2019m not going down jus to go say hey to someone I see small talk. I enjoy all them, and again - all of them I consider my people. \nI just wouldn\u2019t feel okay if I didn\u2019t. \nI typically give the same energy and all, even outside of work. \nI just wish everyone would see how much it affects the entire energy with everyone. People don\u2019t want a whole lot.\nRespect, man. It\u2019s honestly crucial \ud83d\ude29. \n\nI\u2019ve always wished life just had that everywhere really.  And I just felt I needed to share",

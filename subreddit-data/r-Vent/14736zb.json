    "postText": "Before I say anything, I understand that not all men are creepy or weird. \n\nI'm not 18 yet and I'm terrified of men. Not in the way that I would avoid them but any time I'm near a man who looks like an adult, I get filled with a fear that they're going to be creepy. It's gotten to the point that I'm practically psycho-analysing any man that's near me. \n\nYesterday, I went to collect a kebab as my family ordered a takeaway. I go in on my own because I'm very shy and want to improve my social skills. We go there quite often so I recognised the guy at the counter. He immediately knew that I was there for a collection (I'm assuming he recognised me) which made it easier for me as I didn't have to speak much. The kebab shop doesn't have any female workers and there was no female customers. The guy at the counter offered to take one of the bags to my mum's car with me because it was extremely hot (it was I almost burned my hand). I know he was most likely being kind but I got scared. I was like 'aww thank you' and he did as he said he would. On the walk to the car, I was panicking, thinking that he wanted to wanted to see what the car looked like or that he wanted to see my ass because I was wearing shorts. I was terrified but nothing happened. \n\nIt's gotten to the point that I'm scared of my own brother. We don't talk much because he's 28 and we don't have a 'close bond'. My parents have gone away for a couple of days and suddenly I've started thinking that my brother comes into the room when he knows I'm in there and he's started talking to me a lot more than he used to. He's started a conversation every time he walks into the room. He never used to. I might be overthinking this but it feels different. I think I'm paranoid.",

            "comment": "In regards to your brother, since you both seem to have quite the age difference I think it's just that he now feels more comfortable talking to you since you're more mature. I'm the youngest of 3 and I remember noticing some difference from how my siblings talked to me as I got older, they be more comfortable to talk about stuff that if I was younger I wouldn't really understand since I was too young to know anything. So yeah I'm sure you're just overthinking and everything will be fine",

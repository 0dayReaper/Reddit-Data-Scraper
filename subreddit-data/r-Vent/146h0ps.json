    "postText": "Small context, Im in Minnesota and the area I live in is in between south and going into the cities so we get a handful o different people.\n\nIt's absolutely irritating to deal with people that just chew with their gum/food so damn loud, (this may sound racist but I promise I'm not) it would be so nice for people to just learn basic English because of how many damn mistakes and miss communications I deal with mainly from Spanish folks (again I don't mean to sound rude, alot of our Spanish folks are nice), and especially the rich Karen's that *DEMAND* certain small tasks things instantly.\n\nI swear our area the worst of or gas station chain, we had to call the cops so many times. I've learned what a roach is, and learned not to trust people. I'm a female and I hate body complements. Im. Not. That. Stereotype. I'm a proud gamer and somewhat enjoy being around people. I wish people aren't so rude and mean about everything, me and our small crew are like a family and friends. We work hard to keep our store clean and ect. Not even corporate isn't helping because they been pushing 7/11 (probably have the gas station name away) stuff like sending us a surprise echo lab inspection, expecting us to have digital thermometers WITH NO HEADS UP.\n\n\nYes this is very messy post but I need to get this out,  frustrated and I don't wanna dump all of this on my stress boss or mangers. \n\n\n7/11 chill on us please...",

I don't have the guts to tell him it makes me uncomfortable because I don't want to seem rude. Every night he talks about it and I hate it. I also tried to vent to him but he decided to vent before me and not let me. I'm wanting to break up with him but I don't know how. (I'm not looking for help of any kind please don't comment things to \"help\"!)",

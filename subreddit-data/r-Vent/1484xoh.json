    "postText": "I get an annual review where we (my supervisor and I) each fill out a sheet to review the past year and see if our goals and view of the last year align.\n\nWe pretty much matched on everything. Going off his words, I got a glowing review. Even the things to work on (usually weaknesses) were \"continue to do A\" or \"continue to do B\". There was literally no negatives. His plans for me this year (according to the review) are to get a promotion into a leadership role (that I am pretty much already doing, sans the title and pay).\n\nBut when it came to the score that is used as a multiplier for my merit bonus, I still got a .6 (means I met his expectations at minimum). I was stunned because the words on the sheet and the score didn't match. I asked him what it takes to get the rating above it (the next one is a multiplier of .8 and basically states I exceed expectations and the other one is 1 which is what some super star would get) because I was not clear on his rationale for my score.\n\nHe said it's subjective. I said, yeah, it's your judgment call, but I am assuming you have specific criteria in mind for how you are grading me and I want to know what it would have taken to get the higher score. He says I had to proactively do something that he wants me to do when I get my manager position. I'm two positions off that and doing everything above my current one so his excuse for not giving me a higher score is that I didn't do something that managers do? Wtf?\n\nI was so pissed off. I wanted to wring his skinny neck. I know the real thing is he's trying to low ball me so he doesn't have to pay out more on my bonus. I'm also pretty sure he's given higher scores to people I have trained on things I am not responsible (because I am doing way more than my position requires due to last year's same score) or others he favors. Despite him leaning on me heavily, I'm not part of his clique. I think I make more than most of them for a salary (because I have skills that align with my pay, not because I am overpaid) so I think he's trying to keep my bonus lower due to that to. I'm literally being penalized for a having a specialized role that comes with a higher paying job.\n\nTHis is complete BS, but the department is small and there's nothing I can really do about it lest I put a target on my back. So I am going to get the promotion and experience I need and then when I am happy with my experience I am peacing the fuck out. He's pretty much hired a junior and set up a whole dev ops/development strategy around me and what I want, because I am pretty much doing architectural duties despite being an applications dev. But I'm so done being taken advantage of. The moment I am ready to pull that higher paying job somewhere else, I am out and will print out my review and throw it on his desk when I quit.",

Not everything they're going to say is reasonable  and thats a very good example on that one. You are not fat and not even close. If you want to show them fat,send em a video of My 600 Pound Life. Then they might re think what being fat is \ud83d\ude02. But I like the sound of the anti depressants gaining wait but like,will it really be worth it in the end? After awhile you'll have a lot more weight and then you would need to stop cause you don't want to cross the line into being fat and then you're just depressed again.

Even through my strict ballet schedule and efforts to lose weight I kept gaining, just slower. And every time I go through a hardship I drop weight like crazy. A lot of people tell me that I'm going to be fat one day and that I'm making my way there. Even through I look nowhere near fat. And my self esteem is much better now that I've gained. I love my face and my hips, I even love my little tummy. All things I hated a long time ago.",

            "comment": "I took just about every antidepressant known to man. None of them work longer term. All of them cause weight gain. I gained 80 lbs and never was able to take it off. By taking these antidepressants you are just treating the symptoms. You are not the addressing the underlying root of the problem. CBT took away the need to take antidepressants. CBT helped me to change my mindset and make meaningful changes in my life.\n\nIf you are getting off drugs, what you are probably feeling is PAWS ( post acute withdrawal syndrome. Mine lasted about 2 years after a lifetime of abusing drugs. As far as anorexia, maybe you suffer from body dysmorphia issues. Maybe counseling would help with that?\n\nBest of luck in your struggle !",

I stopped abusing hard drugs about three years ago, and I got through disordered eating habits around then too. These are things the person who said this was in my life for and never expressed concern about, but now that I've finally found something that makes me stable, they're concerned for my \"health.\" \n\nWhat works for me is a combination of therapy and meds (specifically my current meds, I've also tried a variety of brands and doses). Without my meds, I can't even keep myself in a good headspace long enough to keep up with therapy. I've tried to go off them a few times, but it just isn't feasible at this point. With medication, I keep a clear enough head to implement what I learn in therapy. Maybe one day I can do it on my own, but right now I need the extra serotonin. \n\nThank you for sharing your experience, but it's not what is a good fit for me. The person who said this knows how long I've been trying to get my mental health in check and how hard it was for me. That's part of why it hurt so much.",

So many people compliment how I used to look being a slender dude in high school from my old photos and my photo of me being 17 on my license photo but I was FUCKING MISERABLE and anxious all the time then. Now I take antidepressants and drink and I could not be happier, though I got a slightly chubby face and a small beer belly on me now, Im actually optimistic and not having constant threatening anxiety, which is what those damn ADHD pills gave me a lot (and it turns out I prob didnt have add, I was just unfocused bc Ive been clinically depressed my whole life). Im trying to work out and fast to lose some fat though, but its just tough and I stress-eat a lot and college gets hells stressful a lot, so thats going ok. For the most part, Im happy and satisfied and thats what matters",

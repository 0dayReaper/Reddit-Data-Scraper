    "postText": "Sorry for the \"click bait\" ... I'm drunk, cold and alone.\n\nOkay... I'm actually good (well, nothing's ever good, but)... I'm better off... It's just alcohol and \"me ol' \" depression kinda go hand in hand.\n\n(I've been wrestling with the thought that depression's just a bad habit that we tend to reinforce)\n\nI'm not an alcoholic, I generally tend to stray away from alcohol because it just amplifies my negative thoughts. \n\nBut, once I'm drunk I tend to keep drinking... Hahaha (I've got more than a few bottles tucked away at home for the rare occasion I come home tipsy).\n\nWell, anyways... Today was one such occasion... I've been fine otherwise... Life's been looking \"up\" (if you can call it that)... \n\nBut, birthdays and other such celebrations call for alcohol and reverie (I've never felt so... And it's getting more and more bleaker...). \n\nI'm used to drinking to compliment my \"dead inside\".\n\nAnd I hate peer pressure (I would rather drink now if it meant saving 30 mins of \"drink with us Baba!!\")...\n\nSo there I was (half an hour after getting home) an enjoyable amount of drunk from after work... But \"me\" negativity enticing me with a whole other bottle of whiskey, and a notebook full of cocktail experiments... (That only being drunk can desensitize you to... Hahaha)\n\nI'm supposed to show up to work real early tomorrow (different job, different site)... WHICH I usually do... drunk, stoned, hungover, or well rested\n\n(but, I've been trying to \"populate the frequency table\" with ,\"well rested\"... More importantly \"good intentioned\") (being present... Working devoutly... Etc)\n\n(My name means \"Devotee\"... So, I've been trying to be more faithful in all of my efforts)\n\nDrunk me's usually on a different level though... He just wants to watch things burn (more than a certified pyro)... He's got good intentions... But more likely than not he gets stuck in self destructive loops (getting into fights, jumping off of roofs, motor accidents, emotional outbursts etc)... And most importantly he loves self deprecating (and talking about himself in third person... Hahaha)\n\nSo, instead of downing half a bottle of \"Fiji's finest\"... I decided to prep a meal fit for kings \n\n(I usually hate prep/cooking for myself... Who cooks for hours only to eat all of it in 15?) (But,... Butter chicken, garlic rotis and a side of \"homemade\" fries)(the alternative being \"homemade\" pasta... But that's so much more work... Plus, I've got to ask to take back my pasta maker) \n\n(i usually eat once a day because I forget that food exists until I'm starving... so, when I do I eat like a demon... and generally nibble on food when somebody offers me a meal otherwise)\n\n(I don't cook unless I'm cooking for company)(so, cooking for myself is a big deal for me... Hahaha)\n\nI'm nearly at my gym now (while I wait for the marinade)... (Beats drinking into the morning, right?)...\n\nBut there's a lot of negativity still a' brewing... So THIS is just \"drunk\" me lashing out... While compounding on all the negative thoughts he's had tonight... Hahaha... (If their still prominent... I might just expand on em' in the comments between sets... Hahaha)\n\nThe cold part being that it's freezing and I refuse to wear warm clothes out of \"spite\"... And the alone part being me feeling miserable about not being able to talk to the person I absolutely (and I mean abso-frikkin-lutely) adore.\n\nTLDR:oh just me under the influence of alcohol lashing out that I'm not drinking anymore and trying to act responsibily hahaha... (Big dreams, Baby steps, eh?)",

Meh, i always feel like I could be doing better.\n\nI usually just keep my worries to myself, but bottling stuff up has been getting to me lately, or maybe I've just started noticing it a bit too late\n\nBut, yeah gym last night was great... Set a new PR (or at least I'd like to believe I did... hahaha).\n\nFood was awesome indeed. I might have gone a bit overboard in the spice department, though... Hahaha (I did manage to save a couple of decent portions for a neighbour couple... They feed me from time to time).\n\nAlso, the one time I decide to make healthy choices, I oversleep and nearly miss the boat out of the city... Hahaha",

I have it too and honestly that\u2019s my logic to it lol. \n\nMaybe you did, when you least expect it alcohol and drugs can make you stronger. Or even feeling happy can too.\n\nAnd that\u2019s awesome you guys swap foods, that means you got people rootin for ya!",

Hahaha\n\nIt always seems like the world's about to end when I'm drunk (the world's about to end, and I don't have the courage or the time to tell the people I care about everything I want to tell them)\n\nYeah, they've (my neighbors) been taking care of me for quite a bit... I wouldn't even know where to begin. But, among all the support (which I'll be eternally grateful for) they've also been patient test subjects for all of my culinary experiments... Hahaha (nothing outlandish... Just slightly extreme)",

                    "comment": "I've been where you are. I used to smoke to keep my depressive thoughts at bay. It's a decent coping mechanism (but, that's all it is... A coping mechanism)\n\n(Funny thing, the semester I started smoking weed, I'd cleared 22 theoretical and 5 laboratory courses ... But, I'd like to believe that that was all me... And the weed just enabled me a bit)\n\nBut, one joint a day soon became 2, then 6, eventually I was smoking to get work done... (I'd smoke a joint or two before my shifts just so I could work peacefully)\n\nNow, this is me... I take my coping mechanisms way too far... (I hope you're stronger and more reasonable than I am).\n\nI also believe that smoking weed is fine even if it's regularly (as long as you've got a personal agenda with the substance... I'm used to taking different substances for different purposes... Hahaha... Alcohol makes me poetic, weed gets me open-minded, I'm exceptionally creative on acid, caffeine gets me drowsy, nicotine makes me stop caring so much etc.)\n\nSo, as long as you've got a clear handle on what's going on in your \"mind prison\", without the need for substances, I'd say you do you.\n\nAlso, I AM NOT ADVOCATING THE USE OF ANY SUBSTANCE whatsoever. But, I understand how trauma and coping work. So, please do be careful.\n\nI've gone from being under the influence every waking minute (for the past 3 years) to the occasional intoxicant with friends... A couple of times a fortnight (for the past 6 months).\n\nAs with anything, a strong support system helps... But, if that's hard to find... Or you can't seem to open up about things... Feel free to shoot me a message... Hahaha (for context... I'm (25M) a bioengineering undergrad who's dropped out of his master's... working a large number of odd jobs... Most commonly as a tradesman)",

(I\u2019m 21F if that helps with the kiddo situation lol) but yea I only ever do it if needed cause I\u2019m a light weight and have anxiety so if I smoke too much I get a whole body like panic attack and if I do accidentally ever do that I tend to just go to bed cause I know it\u2019s not safe to do anything. (I also have someone on stand by to watch the kiddo so I can do it safely since I get impaired)",

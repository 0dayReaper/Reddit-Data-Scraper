    "postText": "I love my work, I love my coworkers (well most..). My issue is I\u2019m stealth transgender (ftm). I like to believe I pass very well. Most people call me He. I only get called she once every blue moon or by transphobic relatives. \n\nBut for some reason, everyone at work calls me She. I correct them, or they ask me what my pronouns are, and they just continue. One calls me he and then hears everyone say she and then starts calling me that. It\u2019s fucking annoying. It\u2019s demotivating. I don\u2019t really get dysphoric much anymore but HOLY FUCK. It\u2019s been so bad I don\u2019t even feel comfortable in my skin. I want to cry in the supply closet. I try to correct people in a \u2018cis\u2019 way, laugh it off and say I\u2019m a dude. But why don\u2019t people get it??? I\u2019ve never had this issue before. So frustrating.",

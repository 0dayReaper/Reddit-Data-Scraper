    "postText": "I was severely bullied in middle school by this girl who hated me for no reason. She would threatened to beat me constantly, threw my stuff into the trash, pushed me randomly when I was walking, called me names, etc.\n\nToday I'm 22 and found out she died last may. I'm not sad about it and kinda wish she'd died sooner so I could have a nicer time in middle school, but I'm feeling kinda bad for thinking like this.\n\nedit: this post got so big and made me feel even shittier, but this is a good thing since wishing someone's death over acts made when they were kids is in fact terrible. I'll try my best to forgive her memory and let this finally go",

Second or third time I ever went skateboarding I was on a little rural street. Cop comes up behind me and spooks us with sirens and a loud buzzer sound, gets out and un-clips his gun holster to scare us. Anyway, two years later somehow a naked mentally ill black man had taken his gun form him and unloaded the clip into his head. No witnesses so we don\u2019t know why he was all alone with the guy or how it happened, but I assumed he was having a good time messing with the guy or maybe fighting him. I feel bad for assuming this but it was in character. Back then I was smug about it, but not so much anymore. There are some more details that would make your head spin but to protect the family he left behind I have to stop there.",

This girl would hit me, pull my hair, push me into my locker, steal my purse, steal my clothes out of my gym locker (we didn't have locks), she hit my best friend so hard once she gave her a concussion. The school never did anything, they just looked the other way. I wasn't a violent kid but there were times when I daydreamed about beating the crap out of her. I hated her and I was really glad when she dropped out during our senior year after getting pregnant. \n\nShe committed suicide just a few months after she quit school, before the baby was born. I honestly didn't care. She made my high school years miserable. However, looking back now I do realize that she was most likely FAR unhappier than I was. Especially since it came out after her suicide that she'd been sexually abused for years and that the baby's father was either her father or her brother. I still can't honestly say I was sorry she was gone.",

She would call me a satan worshipper and told me all the time that I was going to hell. She said that she would pray for my soul and hope I come to my senses and follow gods word. She told me that she was going to burn me at the stake because \u201cthou shall not suffer a witch to live.\u201d My sophomore year in high school she died by gun violence. She was shot in the back of the head by a someone she trusted because that someone did it for a gang initiation. I didn\u2019t feel remorse even though most of the school did. In a way I was kinda glad she passed because that meant that I wouldn\u2019t be bullied anymore.",

            "comment": "I was bullied in 5th grade because the popular guy liked me, a shy, quiet, \u201cbackground character\u201d. They made rumors about me, threatened to beat me, called me fat, a hoe, all these things that I didn\u2019t know about. I was scared. I was paranoid. And people thought something was wrong with me while they wouldn\u2019t go after the people that were causing it. I felt like the people that you were supposed to rely on (teachers, other adults, the very guy that could tell these people to stop bullying me) weren\u2019t there when I needed them.\n\nIn 7th grade, my friend group split up. These people were my emotional support and now they\u2019re distant. I stayed in the middle, and that left me stranded. \n\nIn 8th grade I developed a tough girl persona and the popular guy of the school once again liked me and tried to hit on me. He invited me out to an after school fair and things escalated. I declined his offer on sex, then felt bad the next day when I saw that he was upset. I told him I was ready even though I really wasn\u2019t out of guilt and it spiraled into another backlash from his friends and then my old \u201cfriends\u201d and classmates. He spilled details of our encounter where I talked about how I felt like some of my classmates were judgmental, and my classmates outcasted me. I was lonely and hated. We never did end up having sex but I was painted as the bad guy for not having feelings. My classmates made me feel like I was worthless. I wasted an entire year of my teenage years\u2014I didn\u2019t really have any true emotional support: my parents became my sole support after 7th grade but they had adult problems that couldn\u2019t understand my growing teenage problems, so I\u2019ve learned to hold back because I knew opening up about more vulnerable issues would get me rejected by my parents and others. \n\nNow that we\u2019re adults, I\u2019ve had instances where people from the past have tried to get back in contact with me, at least on social media. The people that bullied me, I have no interest in engaging in. What they did made a lasting impact that I\u2019ve been trying to work through as an adult and they just walk with no consequence. Fuck those people who have tried to hurt us",

I swear it\u2019s true, I couldn\u2019t make that up if I tried.  She lived and I think the dog did too. My first reaction was to LOL because it couldn\u2019t have happened to a more deserving person.\n\nYou didn\u2019t kill her, you just don\u2019t feel sad she\u2019s dead. And why would you? You owe your bully nothing. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.",

I\u2019m of the opinion that they can, at a certain point. Elementary and middle school bullies can definitely change. The gap is so large from middle school to 22 that I can\u2019t see how they couldn\u2019t change through experience. High school bullies? Not sure about that. Closer to adulthood, especially if they\u2019re seniors and juniors.\n\nOne person in the comments said \u201cdon\u2019t feel bad, they didn\u2019t feel bad for traumatizing you,\u201d but we don\u2019t know that for sure. There\u2019s no information in the post suggesting that.\n\nThe emotional damage that people suffer from bullying probably convinces them to think like this. It\u2019s easier to think that the person who made your life miserable is incapable of change and is immutably evil than to consider that they could have changed for the better.\n\nEdit: Maybe \u201cpsychos\u201d isn\u2019t the right word.

We live in a small town so most of the town knew at least 1 of them. The town was in mourning. I felt mixed feelings at first but reading the heartbreaking posts from his mother brought me around. Yes, I wish he knew the pain he caused me that still affect me to this day but he was her son. He was a lot more to a lot of people. I can still hate him for the trauma he cause me but that doesn't mean I'm happy he's passed.",

We never got along , but had mutual friends. I felt sad for her that she could be taken at such a young age and that she was leaving a child behind and died a tragic death. Whatever she said/did in middle school/ high school didn\u2019t matter to me, because I didn\u2019t know how she was when she passed away. I saw how people said she was funny and things like that and I remembered, yeah she was kind of funny. Sad that she\u2019s gone, people can change\u2026. And just because we never got along doesn\u2019t mean that there weren\u2019t people in her life who did enjoy and love her.\n\nAlso when I found out, I was 20, I\u2019m now 21. I like to think we\u2019re adults now, and part of being a adult is growing up , forgiving, and not holding grudges over things that happened to us in middle school.",

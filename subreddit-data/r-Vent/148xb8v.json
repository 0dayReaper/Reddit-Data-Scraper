I\u2019d watch the pipe line slowly happen, the more Jordan Peterson content he shared was becoming a regular staple to his Instagram stories. It makes more and more sense why he surrounds himself with young people. They\u2019re total yes men and never challenge him on these topics because he likes to throw around big words to sound \u201csmart\u201d but really the shit that he says is ridiculous. Instantly saw the messages and got the ick. Didn\u2019t respond and just am going to back away.",

    "postText": "I want to preface this vent by saying that I think BLM has great intentions and has done really great things for our community and other POC as well. I don't hate BLM, I don't disagree with the movement, I just hate what it's done to MY generation only.\n\nIf you're a young millennial or a Gen-Z, you are probably using a lot of social media. Chances are you have at least seen Social Justice happening on those social medias. Well, great we spread the word and now everyone can support BLM, right? Right so now it's a fight between white girls and black girls to prove who's better, now its who can wear braids in their hair, now it's who can speak \"ghetto\", now it's immediately policing people who don't fit your stereotype of what you want a POC to look like and that's what I'm mad about most.\n\nI have a blood disorder, my skin is light and I wear wigs over my protective styles so first glance, you wouldn't know I'm black, maybe not a POC. JUST BECAUSE I DON'T LOOK LIKE WHAT STEREOTYPE YOU IMAGINE BLACK PEOPLE LOOKING LIKE, DOESNT MEAN I'M ANY LESS BLACK. I hate trying to contribute to a movement that constantly argues with me ABOUT MY OWN RACE. Constantly I get told what race I am, people literally accuse me of lying (like why would I do that), and black girls don't take me seriously. \n\nSo thanks Gen-Z, you're ruining a movement that was meant for people like me and literally shoving me out of it.\n\nEdit: I did NOT expect this to blow up. A couple things i want to mention that I guess I didn't. I don't BLAME the BLM movement, the reason I fault it is because that movent made this kind of behavior very popular among people in my generation and no one is educating them on actually supporting POC vs being an ignorant white savior.",

The opinions of others'. And in the process they are creating more like them. And as usual: hate is easier to spread than love. And these people hold no shame whatsoever. \n\nDo not listen to people screaming half opinions built on misinterpreted data, for it will only corrupt you. Seek out those who humbly present their opinion and give thought-provoking critique if you disagree.\n\nNow that is quite hypocritical for me to say if you were to go through my comment history.

I get what your saying you hate having to reaffirm who you are. You're blood disorder isn't a hindrance to your identity. \n\nI also think that your point is stemming from the concept of Blackfishing. Where some (not all) non-poc have been seen with darker makeup and coming off as mixed to I don't know fit in with the culture. I'm not sure. I'm black and find it weird to wear darker makeup like its weird. So your probably unfortunately getting grouped in with those people. I'm sorry you have to deal with this. \n\nI just think its easy to blame the faction and group when its really people just using that message and applying it to situations like this. BLM isn't here to condemn others, people are using it to condemn others.\n\nEdit: Grammar and what not. Also wanted to add there's some great videos on what blackfishing is and why its weird of YouTube. I'll do some searching to add links.",

You mean to tell a girl you don't even know on social media what her race?? Upon seeing a picture of her parents, her mom is CLEARLY white and her dad is CLEARLY black... You can't always tell someone's race by skin color alone. \n\nSocial media gives some people this feeling of superiority. \"Oh, these people can't touch me, so I can speak my mind,\" yet you do know you are talking to people just as real as you from around the world and your words can affect others for years to come, don't you? Not to mention the things you say affect how the world sees you. If we want to make the world a better place, maybe people should know when to admit they don't know something or they were wrong.... In a perfect world, perhaps. \n\nOP, I can't imagine the struggles you might go through on the daily. I'm a mid-20s white woman and while I've faced bullying related to severe symptoms of a mood disorder in school, being discriminated based on race seems much harder. It's something you simply can't hide. I applaud you for speaking your mind. Not everyone knows what it's like to be a minority and the need to be strong in the way you do every day.",

We also say this because of the tension-based alopecia they face. The 'ghetto' talk you're mentioning has a name, it's African American Vernacular English, AAVE for short and generally speaking, no one comes for people who naturally speaks it. But when you listen to someone talk like they're Brad from Malibu's Most Wanted...someone is definitely going to call them out. \n\nBut you are one hundred percent correct, Black people come in every single color and shade, in every single walk of life, from every style and sub-culture and we are not one monolith. No one should try and police your blackness ever. It's wholly unfair and inappropriate and cruel.\n\nIt feels like you may need to find a BLM group that has a varied group of moderators, both from the older generation and the Gen-Z group because I will be very honest, Gen Z is very proactive but also very prone to jumping first and looking for the pool second.",

I don't care about white people (or any other race) wearing black hairstyles or talking a certain way. If anything I think wearing a black hairstyle is cultural appreciation. Some of them make it a black vs white thing when IMO we should focus more on our race. BLM is just a hypocrite movement. White people can't be racist towards us but we can be racist towards them. Only dark-skinned people can face colorism. White people cant wear daishikis and box braids but we can wear anything from every culture. And then when other races call them out on their hypocrisy they're deemed as racist. This is not right.",

One side it allows for other people of color to be represented within the movement as well and doesn't restrict itself as a organization. \n\nIn the other side it allows black supremacist people to infiltrate the movement and create a stigma. \n\nAnd yes it exists.

I would consider myself a sjw but I chilled out a little when people began telling people they could or couldn't be a race. People had to post childhood pics, or pics of family just to prove it. And then once its proved, no \"sorry we were wrong\" just move on to the next one.\n\nI dont think the view or issue necessarily correlates with blm, just that a lot of people are using blm as an outlet to voice their views.\n\nThere are people who hop on the blm bandwagon, and try to make themselves look more \"ethnic\" or more \"poc\" to get clout which is very disturbing. So I do get why people question race.\n\nBut harassing people to the point they share what is otherwise private (like family photos or childhood photos), is not okay. And telling people \"no you cant be because you dont look like what the general stereotype for this group looks like\" is not okay, and is inherently colorism at the least. And telling you that you can not benefit from a movement that was created for people like you, simply because you are not \"enough\" is just so shitty. According to everyone else, you will be treated as such, so blm absolutely pertains to you.\n\nSorry you have to go through this, I empathize with you and while I am not black, I am a \"foreign looking\" white so I completely understand being outcast of a group you identify with.\n\nI dont really have a solution but just lots of empathy and hugs.",

Then we have people saying all live matter which in many ways can be seen as disrespectful to BLM movement, but in my opinion this is just all a waste of energy because look at what Dr. MLK fought for...EQUALITY. The moment one says BLM than we have people of other races get offended because than they feel as if they are not include, which is probably why all lives matter came into existence. People are just so caught up in trends or just so defensive about everything now that its hard to make the same impact that MLK had on the U.S. To be completely honest, we just have too much going on right now. We have the fear of Covid, people arguing about who is better in means of social justice, you have the whole Trump and Biden thing going on. Oh and we can not forget about everyone dealing with depression and anxiety more than ever! That is why I left social media and do not participate in anything political nor social justice. I am super mixed people think I am either white, mexican, middle eastern, armenian, or half black. I think people just need to categorize others so they can have some type of comprehension of who or what you are. It helps them sleep better at night. Anyways my main thing is that white people always say \"what I am not racist I have black friends\" like how does that prove that you are not racist. A real non-racist person would never say something like that! I just think that right now we all should be focusing on our own lives and mental well being instead of feeding into useless propaganda or other peoples lives and problems.

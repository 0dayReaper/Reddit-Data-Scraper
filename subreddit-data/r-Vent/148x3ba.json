    "postText": "Do you ever feel like your personality is half-baked like you missed out on a major important developmental year because you had to play a character? I feel like I don't have a personality and the only real thing I can offer is being trans my experiences in life seem to lack so much compared to everybody else even some fellow trans people seem like they have more together than me. It's impossible to make friends with people because of this I just play a passive role in every conversation because I have nothing to offer other than being trans. The few hobbies I have are underdeveloped and the most forming parts of my life have been stolen from me I can never have the childhood I wish I had and I'm stuck being a nobody with nothing to offer alone and haunted by my regrets.",

    "postText": "I left my computer opened being logged into facebook and went to have some paperwork done with my teacher's assistance at her desk. When i came back to my computer i saw the dude ( C) i was hanging out with giggling about something, thought nothing of it and went home.\n\n A friend of mine called me asking me if i knew something. I did as he instructed logging into my facebook account. It was only at this point that i realized my profile picture was changed into something without my knowledge and it was a pic of me smiling wide holding the phone with hentai shown on it as a joke , without context. \n\nIt clicked. I knew C was behind this. He said C was even running out of the room laughing and asked   what he thought of what he ( C)  did. I was disappointed. \n\nI knew i had to confront him. But when conflict arises, i chose to be silent, not out of fear, but out of disgust and disappointment. It was just a picture, i get it, i told myself. But the damage was already done, my brother saw the post, my mom saw it, they started questioning me. My mom gave me a lecture. I knew telling her about the guy and the context wouldnt ease her anger. She only cared about why i got a hold of that sexual content in the first place. My mom forbids dating, thinks i'm still her little girl, and got mad over that. Despite my explanation. \n\nI got so motherfucking livid. I asked him about it. He said it was just a picture. Ok bro. So the fact that you didn't respect me enough to not violate my privacy, the fact that you knew that account was public to my relatives and family and still did it should get swept under the carpet now? Who the fuck am i to you? A fucking fly? It was the fact that he didn 't think of my emotions and still expected me to be fine with it. \n\nMind you, this motherfucker usually is the one to laugh when i get low grades ( not that frequent to be honest) he would mock and make fun of me for it, tell everyone i knew about it. Yet the moment i got high scores he was no where to be seen. Bruh. I confronted him about this too. \n\nIt is funny that people start blaming you for reacting but not themselves for how they treated you. \nGetting an apology or whatever wouldnt even fix anything. I hate confrontations when im the one enduring the damages. When the fuck did i have an obligation to make excuses for you so you can stay in my life.\n\n\nI blocked him on social media. In school i ignored him, acted like i didnt know him. Walked right past him. Whatever.\n\nYou did what you did to me. I dont want revenge. Leave me alone.\n\nBut then he acts like he knows me, he tells me jokes when i see him ( not like i can choose). He turns to me whenever someone makes a joke. Wtf??? Pls just get out of my sight you stupid turtle cheese lizard mentally handicapped landwhale.\n\nI learned that he had a crush on me from a mutual. \n\nBro wtf happened to love letters \" i love you so imma disrespect you and blame you for getting mad at me?\" \n\nBro was prolly an insecure prick and thought he was funny. Ha ha ha. You got no bitches and  never getting bitches.",

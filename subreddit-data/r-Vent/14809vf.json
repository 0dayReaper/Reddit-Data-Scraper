I always fight him and try and scan my card or give my card to the waitress but he always snatches it away from me or takes it when i\u2019m not looking. i SWEAR i\u2019ve tried every single time to pay now. i feel bad because i like to hang out with him but he always pays and i don\u2019t want to make it look like i\u2019m just using him. how could i repay him?",

You continued accepting w.o putting your foot down and having a conversation on it. Worse part he might be harboring negative feelings and might pop if you don't initiate a realtalk.",

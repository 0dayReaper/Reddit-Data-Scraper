I've given you so much understanding, love and time yet you've done nothing but make me miserable. You preach about having to adjust to people so they would to you, but the thing is, everything you've asked me to do I've done, yet you refuse to do anything for me. Is it too much that I just want you to stop shitting on people like me and saying that we're gross and don't deserve rights? All I want is some appreciation and respect. I know you're still going through a lot and might not mean the stuff you say but dude please just be a little grateful.",

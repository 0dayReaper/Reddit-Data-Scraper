    "postText": "the end of end of the years got me stressed for so many reasons. one troubling my annoying head right now is  the yearbooks being given out today. when i got the photo originally in beginning of the year for my id, i was already upset. but i told myself (no matter how persistent my friends were to see my photo) that no one but me will see it. at least to the end of the year. \n\ni\u2019ve tried so so so so hard to be pretty to at least be bearable to look at. so much make-up i put on. my hair fried by my flat iron. but no. i look at that photo, that photo that everyone now has. and see that ugly fucking face looking at me. i feel embarrassed that i ever feel that it\u2019s okay to walk outside with my face. that this disgusting face should ever b seen. by anyone. the thing is, it\u2019s not only that picture. its every single one. i cant bare when people take pictures. i cant bare the thought that. that is what people see when they look at me. \n\nhighschoolers do as they do. and throughout the whole day i hear people shit talking other peoples photos. i sit there thinking, \u201cit\u2019s im next\u201d. i know people have made fun of me. because how can they not. i\u2019m ugly. \n\nthank you for anyone who decided to read this. \u2606",

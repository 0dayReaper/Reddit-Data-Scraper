So why not try offering the slightest shred of kindness to these people who didn\u2019t choose their awful attractions and want very much not to act on them? Seeing them as human beings with an awful affliction, and offering them therapy that recognizes their humanity while helping treat that affliction, can only lead to fewer children being harmed.\n\nWhen I was suicidally depressed, I started having intrusive thoughts about harming animals. I\u2019d die before I\u2019d harm an animal, but I kept seeing images of dead ones in my head, and imagining that I was the one who had hurt them. I didn\u2019t choose to have those thoughts, and I tried to stop having them, but they kept coming back. They were awful enough I almost killed myself. Then I got some really good behavioral therapy, and I was able to fight those thoughts back and make them less dominant in my head. \n\nSo now we have evidence from researchers that two things are true: one, behavioral therapy is effective, and two, the best way to get someone to enter and stick with therapy of any kind is to offer non-judgmental treatment that recognizes their humanity. Stigma\u2019s not working, so why not recognize that thoughts don\u2019t equal actions and offer treatment to help keep them from becoming actions? It seems to me that\u2019s a far better option than judging their thoughts.",

If it helps, Walker never once says, in the entire book, that we should condone offending against children.

Since we can't prevent pedophilia, why shouldn't we help prevent people with an attraction (one they hate and didn't choose) from acting on it?",

If a person can retain themselves to rape others, so can they retain themselves from raping children, you know? It's just going to be harder for them since they have no real life acceptable outlet (as it should be, and I am not saying there should be some. Sex dolls, maybe). To be even more clear, the simple thought of a child shaped sex doll is quite revolting, as are drawings. But if I would be sure it keeps them at bay, and save actual children from being molested, I would build them and draw them myself to give to them.\n\nAlso, what you mean by sexuality, exactly? The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines sexuality as \"*the sexual habits and desires of a person*\" . By that definition, pedophilia is a sexuality. Perverted, sickening, unacceptable, but a sexuality none the less. If you talk about normal behaviors, I agree it is very far from normalcy and decency, and it shouldn't absolutely become something that mainstream society desensitizes about.\n\nMaybe I understand what they might go trough, because I too have a weird fetish, even though its consequences bring no harm, since it's physically impossible for my desires to become truth.\n\nIf you want to know I am into &gt;!natural body magic. Basically any kinds of impossible/ highly unconventional anatomy. From the that woman in \"total recall\" with three breasts, to swapping body parts from people, even of different sexes, to conjoinment, parts retaining consciousness after being swapped, reduced anatomy, humantaurs, any of that stuff if what gets me. !&lt; I know it's weird, but I am like this since I can remember, and nothing will be able to \"cure\" me",

If it did, I'd be stalking my celebrity crush right now. I'm not, though, because I understand that acting on your attractions can be harmful. It's perfectly fine if I'm attracted to a celebrity; it's not fine if I stalk them.\n\nI too experienced sexual abuse as a child. That's why I think it's SO important to help people who are attracted to children not to act on it. If that means treating them with basic human courtesy, well, let's show some basic human courtesy, then. Whatever is most likely to make them seek and continue treatment. Whatever is most likely to protect another child from going through what I went through.\n\nKnee-jerk reactions perpetuate the problem. Thoughtful reactions can help stop it. I can put myself in other people's shoes long enough to imagine how horrible it would be to have an attraction you didn't choose, and to be unable to talk to anyone about it. I don't in any way condone child abuse, but I'm able to imagine the pain of those who don't want to abuse them. Helping those people helps children.",

It is what it is.....thank goodness he didn't act on it. I hope he gets treatment. \n\n\nNow say I'm shopping with my kids and a MAP person is shopping next to me.....he/she sees my kids. You get the gist of where this story is heading......that's a child who can't protect themselves, that's a mother who is utterly helpess while a fucking creep next to you is having sexual fantasies of my children. While I'm fucking shopping. These people need to be away from society. As a human being you should agree with me. We need to protect the children.

How very much I wish the person who molested me had been able to get treatment for his attractions before he acted. \n\nSo no, as a human being, I don't agree with you. I don't think anyone should be punished for having thoughts; that would be pointless. I don't think anyone should be punished for having an attraction, because we don't choose who we're attracted to. Instead, I think we should see all people as people, have compassion for those with unwanted attractions they didn't choose, and use all available research to determine how best to help them. That's how we decrease child abuse.",

A child molester ( a CM or a ChiMo if you want to use acronyms at any cost) is someone that is guilty of some crime of that caliber, while the term pedophile would be associated with \"MAPs\".

Social justice is a good thing. Fighting for equality, representation , healthcare, climate change, hunger. Is a good thing.  But, then you get this MAP thing or people that try to make pedophiles more acceptable. Which no. Not all sexualities should be acceptable. Such as being attracted to children.  And society should take a hard stance on pedophilia.  Then there\u2019s the fat acceptance movement which seems like it could of been a good thing. But I think it\u2019s lost the plot.  When I see people on Tik Tok or only fans gorging on food. I can\u2019t accept that. If you want people to treat you nice. Not make fun of you and treat you with some common decency. That\u2019s a good thing. But, obesity is a health disorder. If your out canceling your doctor cause their worries you might be heading towards diabetes. Then the movement is going to far. Or if people rage on Twitter because X person lost weight. A person bettered themselves and got healthier you should applaud them. Not scorn them.  If you go to a restaurant and they have keto or paleo or vegan or sugar free options. Don\u2019t bitch on Twitter about it.  But, yes society should be more accepting of people. But not necessarily enabling. Pedophiles should seek psychiatric help before they harm a child. Obese people should be encouraged to adopt healthier lifestyles. They shouldn\u2019t be forced. But maybe eating a tub of ice cream on live stream or in general isn\u2019t a good thing.",

But perhaps the pressure we put on innocent people can actually push them into acting on the unpleasant and unacceptable idea. Perhaps we should help them treat their disorder instead of ostracize them.\n\nOther people will take advantage of this and pretend to be such people but are actually trying to sneak by and then commit a crime.\n\nBut that's just my 2 cents on the topic.",

Kinda just shows the sexual awakenings/body realizations that we all went through during puberty. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inherently pedophilic, or even (most scenes) inherently sexual\u2026 for example, learning about your body isn\u2019t inherently sexual, and it doesn\u2019t suddenly become pedophilic just because it\u2019s a preteen learning about their body. It only becomes that if it turns you on. I think the show could be pedo if the watcher MADE it that way, but that\u2019s almost all media. Sick people will be sick. It feels more like a show for viewers to laugh and say, \u201comg I remember that\u201d imo.

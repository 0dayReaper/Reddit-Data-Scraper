    "postText": "I can agree to disagree, but not about this. Let me tell you why: \n\n1. Within the first 8 weeks, the \u201cbaby\u201d is actually just a zygote (unspecialized cells that have not formed tissues, organs, etc.).\n2. Early term abortion is simply the expulsion of these unspecialized cells.\n3. Murder is the brutal killing of a fully developed human being that has the capability to think, feel, and act. Abortion is the removal of unspecialized cells that cannot do *any* of these things.\n4. People will still attempt to get unsafe abortions even if the law changes. \n5. You can\u2019t force someone to be a mother who doesn\u2019t want to be. That\u2019s pro-birth, not pro-life. Being pregnant and giving birth is a grueling and dangerous process. If a woman doesn\u2019t want to be a mother, she shouldn\u2019t be forced to go through all of that suffering.\n7. Telling people not to have sex is just illogical. People are going to have sex. People are going to rape each other. Protection is going to fail. Sometimes unwanted pregnancies JUST HAPPEN. \n8. If you haven\u2019t been in this situation, you will never understand how it feels.",

It's her body, not the fathers body.\n\nAt the end of the day, the choice falls down to the person who has to go through the 9 month process of having the kid. If the father doesn't want the kid he doesn't have to be. It's up the the mother on if she wants to press for child support. The same would be for if the mother didn't get an abortion and gave the kid to the dad, it would then be up to the dad to decide on if he wants her to pay child support and child support is determined by the court system.\n\nLike previously said, the father can have a say, but at the end of the day the choice isn't his to make, it's the woman's choice to make as it's her body and resources being used",

I get that accidents happen as BC and condoms are not 100% but that doesn't mean one parent should be shit out of luck and stuck financially paying for a kid. If you don't want a kid, make sure to have sex with someone of the same feeling that you 100% know does not want kids. Even discuss before hand what will happen if the woman(or you) does fall pregnant, will yall decide to keep it, will yall abort it. If you get pushback on aborting or pushback on being in the kids life (when you don't want a kid) then that is not someone you need to be having sex with.\n\nTry not to be the one who first brings up you don't want kids as are are a ton of people who do want them but will pretend they don't because they think there is a chance their partner will change their mind when they find out there is a chance they might be having a kid.\n\nIf the person you're wanting to bang has an issue with aborting a kid you don't want, or has an issue with you not wanting to be in the kids life, keep your genitals in your pants and keep moving.\n\nPreventing pregnancy goes both ways, and there are simple discussions you can have to determine if you really should be banging the person you're going to bang. If you know for a fact you don't want kids, don't have sex with someone that can't decide if they want them or not. One night stands or spur of the moment sex is fun and all but you run the risk of the person you're having sex with deciding they want to keep the baby instead of aborting it.\n\nThis isn't just directed at men either, ladies yall can have these conversations as well to avoid banging men who want kids.\n\nIf a kid is made, born and the parent (whichever one wanted the kid and got it) can press for child support, I don't believe the 'but I didn't want the kid, why do I have to pay child support' argument has ever swayed a court rooms decision to go 'oh well they didn't want it, so they don't have to pay' you still had a hand, you didn't make sure yall both were on the same playing grounds in regards to not wanting kids",

It\u2019s similar to to organ donation consent - someone is totally dependent on someone else\u2019s body parts for their survival. Even if there\u2019s only one person in the world with a match, you can not force them to give any part of their body, even if it means the other person will die. \n\nYou just can\u2019t make medical decisions like that for someone. I can not make my partner get a vasectomy. He can not make me incubate his dna. Some dude could say he doesn\u2019t want me to get an abortion - well what if I have a condition, or know that I\u2019m losing my job in a few months? The only one who can make a decision regarding pregnancy is the one carrying it. \n\nNow, if a guy doesn\u2019t want a child but the woman goes through with it\u2026I\u2019m on the fence here, but it should be recognized that at this point there\u2019s now a live child in the picture that needs financial support. If unwilling fathers are allowed to back out, there should be better programs for support. \n\nI\u2019m all for increased options for male birth control so they\u2019re better able to protect themselves if they don\u2019t want children but don\u2019t want to get snipped and just omg haaate condoms (which can still fail if used). Even better, I\u2019m for advancement in technology so that a pregnancy can be transferred between partners and both can carry it equal times, then we can talk lol",

Especially if you got pregnant on accident.\n\nYou do you.\n\nGoing into the third trimester(week 27 to delivery) I personally believe that it should be reserved for medical issues that may potentially harm the baby or mother - mothers body and livelihood takes priority(no duh). Or for incest or r*ape/SA babies seeing as there is a lot of trauma to work through on top of the stress of being pregnant as a result.\n\nThere should be deadline if the baby is healthy and no medical issues are showing. I'd say 2 weeks before the expected due date.\n\nAm I gunna try to force this shit onto anyone? Nah, you do you. Am I gunna be disgusted/disappointed in someone who uses abortion instead of birth control/safe sex? Yes.\n\n\nNot every pregnancy is a accident, nor should they be treated as one(unless of course it was an accident). So if you and your partner are trying and you get an abortion without then knowing, youre the scum of the Earth. There are people worse than you, but youre still low ranking.\nYes, its your body but it took both of you to communicate that pregnancy is what was desired - therefore both of you need to communicate if an abortion should be had.\n\nIf you view your partner as nothing but a sperm doner, and don't care what your partner wants - leave and find someone else who wants what you do.",

Like an abortion could've been the brightest mind in whatever subject but it's better to focus on what happens in the future, not what could've happened.\nI also understand that there are some people who claim to be pro-life but are actually pro-birth and those people are generally rude and horrible to anyone with any other view but ya can't change how they feel. \n\nOverall, everyone is entitled to their own opinion and it's hard to change people when they don't want to change.",

They really like homogeneity. This much is obvious, but it manifests in more unexpected ways. They think if they can just forcefully strong arm people into their way of thinking, then they will realize that it's *objectively and undeniably correct*. Which kinda makes sense for christians because the whole premise is that morality is absolute (because there is one god who is the sole decider of what is and is not moral)\n\nI was talking to someone more conservative about how I like living in the city but it's hard to find a place. He said I should move to the country. I explained I have lived in the country but it's not the lifestyle I prefer. He kept fuming about it and talked about the city as if it were an objectively negative place and my opinion was simply incorrect\n\nI think he basically thought \"if he just moved to the country and lived *my* lifestyle, he would realize it's *the correct* lifestyle. He would give up on the city and become a conservative, like me\"",

Neither pro choice or pro life beliefs are morally wrong, it\u2019s a difference in ideology. One prioritizes personal freedom, one prioritizes protecting life. Yes, a woman having to go through an unwanted pregnancy and the effects it\u2019ll have on her life are sad. Yes, aborting a fetus that would\u2019ve grown into a person is sad. It\u2019s a hard choice, they\u2019re both fucking sad so stop shaming the other side.\n\nEdit: The fact that this unbiased open minded comment is being downvoted truly shows just how close minded and intolerant people are.

Your comment oozes a lack of self-awareness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What\u2019s not in doubt is the outsize toll that abortion has taken on the black population post-Roe. In New York City, thousands more black babies are aborted than born alive each year, and the abortion rate among black mothers is more than three times higher than it is for white mothers. According to a city, Health Department report released in May, between 2012 and 2016 black mothers terminated 136,426 pregnancies and gave birth to 118,127 babies. By contrast, births far surpassed abortions among whites, Asians, and Hispanics.\n\nNationally, black women terminate pregnancies at far higher rates than other women as well. In 2014, 36% of all abortions were performed on black women, who are just 13% of the female population.\"",

You see a man beating up a woman in public, do you mind your business? You see a white person calling someone else racist slurs, do you mind your business? You see someone steal a woman's bag while she isn't looking, do you mind your business? \n\nI am pro choice definitely and hate the idea of pro life. I just always hated hearing people say to mind your business, it sounds like \"I have no valid excuse for my actions, therefore its other peoples job to look away when I do questionable shit\". When I hear \"mind your own business\" I think of a high school bully who doesn't want to be bothered while beating up another kid for their lunch money.",

    "postText": "I recently went to one of my brothers wedding, and I hated it. He had separated from the family a few weeks before but still invited us. The reason he separated was because his, at the time, fiance called our mom a dictator and he didn't tell her that wasn't OK. My dad talked to him saying how he should have at least said something, and instead of letting it go, my brother made a big argument about it and insulted my mom further. He called her a narcissist and said he was moving out the next day. He originally was in between moving so I gave up my room to let them sleep in until they could find a place. I looked up to my brother, growing up, he taught me how to enjoy life through video games and music, so when he left it hurt. Instead of my dad, growing up, I had this brother as the supporting male figure in my life, I have a dad, but he wasn't there as much as this brother was. \n\nHis, now, wife, i saw her as a sister, she was the one I'd talk to instead of this subreddit, and she'd help me through a lot, but now I never want to see her again. She made me believe that she was a good person, that she was my family, my friend, but she stabbed me in the back as well. She once told me that she couldn't lie, that it was impossible for her to do that, which was obvious from the many failed attempts. However, that day they left, she said so many lies without hesitation, acting like a completely different person, so was my brother. All my parents wanted was a sorry from the wife for insulting my mom, and a sorry from, or even a reson, from my brother for not defending my mom, instead, they just kept pushing the buttons.\n\nMy mom had a panic attack because of the event, she was shaking uncontrollably, crying very hard and breathing heavily. I suffer from panic attacks too, but I've never gotten one as bad as hers was that day, I'm usually able to calm myself down before then. My mom is one of the strongest person I know, she only ever cried when her mom died, and when my dad and her got into bad fights. Actually, since my brother left, they've been getting into more frequent fights, it used to be once a month, now it seems to be every other day.\n\nHe left a few days before my graduation from high-school, before all this, I was so excited to have them there, and I was so excited to go to there wedding, but after, I just wanted to be left alone. The reason the wife called my mom a dictator was because my mom likes to joke and the wife doesn't. My mom doesn't like anything Gothic and believes weddings should stick to tradition, however, all she ever did for their wedding, was give suggestions, which they would always turn down immediately. So as a joke, she would turn down their ideas, which were mostly Gothic ideas, and joke saying she wouldn't go in a very obviously joking voice. However, they would take it seriously and change their plans, knowing fully well, my mom would have gone no matter what, because she'll do anything for her kids. Eventually, this joking broke the wife, and she gets aggravated so easily, you could just say one thing mean about her hair or something like, \"oh, I don't like it that much\" and she'd start crying. Anyways, it broke her and she spilt her guts about how she truly felt about this family. \n\nShe called my mom a dictator, where all the problems started, and this was not the first time she's insulted her. Although my mom is strong mentally, she's weak medically. One day, we were at Disney springs, my brother and his wife are Disney adults, me and mom hate Disney because we can't go on any rides, me becuase I'm scared of rollercoaster, and mom because she has back problems, my dad has heart problems, but he still finds a way to have fun, somehow. Anyways, we were at Disney springs, and my mom had been feeling really bad for a few days, but was touching it out to be with the family, however, that day she was feeling extra bad, so we had to leave early. By early, I mean late at night, like a few hours before they closed. However, the wife wanted a candy apple before we left, but my mom was not feeling good, she looked like she was about to pass out. So I tried to reason with her, told her she could go get it and and catch the next bus back to our hotel which was a Disney hotel. She said no because my brother would get mad and asked why my mom couldn't just handle it for a few more hours. I was already starting to get mad at that, and I told her, \"she's old and fragile, she can't handle these things for to long\" and she retorted with, \"well, my moms older then yours and she could have handled it... I wanted to slap her so much then and there, but I didn't, I said whatever and walked away, I don't argue with children and that was the most childish response I could have gotten from her.\n\nShe also always makes japs at how my mom doesn't work and thus she doesn't either, my brother also doesn't \"believe in money\", I still don't know what that means. He's the kind of guy that believes money does grow on trees and spends it willy nilly. Anyways, when she called my mom a dictator, that was strike three, and throughout those first two strikes, I was the one to defend my mom, not my brother, the wife of that lier.\n\nThe day they left, he told us, me, my mom, and my dad, that leaving that family was the best idea he ever had... I was his family, I looked up to him, and he hurt me so bad with those words. After he left and things calmed down, my dad, who treats his boys like they're still baby's and me like I'm apart of the military or something, tries to convince my mom to apologize to my brother so he can go to the wedding with her. I was firm in my decision, the only reason I went so I could support my mom, not for the couple. It angered me that my father could even think of having my mom apologize. She did nothing wrong, she wasn't even gonna bring it up, she was going to keep it between me, her, and my dad, but father decided to be the jerk he is and ruin our lives again. They were also fighting at the time and he thought that dealing with that situation would clear things over for him and my mom, it didn't. Now he keeps pushing the fault on someone else, my mom, like he does for everything. If something doesn't go his way, he gets so upset and acts like a flipping child. My two brothers take to much after him and I keep telling my mom, \"you didn't raise three kids, you raised three kids and a man baby\" and he's older then her! They had my oldest brother while she was 17 and he was 22! He should be the one acting like an adult, instead he acts like a child, just like his fully grown sons. I cry, very often, I'm very sensitive and I usually don't care for insults unless they're about my fears or mental health, which he likes to downplay, but even I'm not that childish, and im 18, im supposed to be just learning to be an adult.\n\nBack to the matter at hand, my brothers friends convinced him to invite us, the day before the wedding which we had to drive four hours to get to. The night before my graduation, my father guilt tripped my mom into convincing me to text my brother and invite him, i didn't want to, but id do anything for my mom... that was the first time i made her cry. I got a text back saying he couldn't come because he was already in Orlando, about a two-three hour drive, but that he was proud of me, a lie i believe for a split second. Days of holding it in, and i crided so hard, crying to god to bring my brother back and make things normal again, im not very religious, but i was desperate. I cried so much and was begging to hold my mom and have her tell me everything was ok, so i made the mistake of going to her room to ask her to do that for me. However, when she read the text as I held her she had another panic attack, apologizing to me for taking my brother away, for ruining this family when none of it was her fault. I said I cry often, but I don't cry hard in front of my parents, I don't like showing my emotions to people, but that night, I cried so hard, asking for her forgiveness, asking for God's forgiveness, asking anyone that would listen for forgiveness. The next morning I had to pretend I was happy in front of my friends, but all of them have known me since the beginning of middle school, so they kept asking what was wrong. I told them a half truth, they know my parents fight a lot, so I told them it was family issues and they left it alone... I suffered through all that because he, Mr. Money man, couldn't buy a plane ticket to my graduation, but we were expected to be at his wedding. He hadn't even talked to us or even tried to talk to us since then, and he expected us to be there?! I was so mad when I heard and begged my mom not to go, but my father is very good at guilt tripping her, and she decided to go anyways, meaning I had to go to. There was no way I was going to let a manipulative prick, a lying jerk, a self centered man, and my drunk other brother stay alone with my mom.\n\nAfter my father practically guilt tripped my mom into going, and thus me, we had to stand there for only 20 minutes before we could leave, and even that was hard. When he greeted me, he tried to hug me, but I backed away, when he talked to me, I looked away and didn't respond. I hate that I had to do that, I was always so excited to see him before and would give him big bear hugs whenever he visited, but this time, I couldn't even look at him. After that, we all introduced ourselves to her side of the family, mind you, no other person in our family had an issue with him but they weren't invited either, but everyone in her family was. After that, me and mom sneaked away to the bathroom where she proceeded to break down crying, my brother didn't try to hug her, he just gave her a pat on the shoulder and left. We're a Hispanic family, hugging upon greeting is normal, its not just a family thing and it's respectful to do so no matter the problems. I didn't hug him because he no longer has my respect, but my mom deserves his respect, and he spat in her face. Seeing her cry made me cry, and my father wasn't helping, telling us we should go back in and just get it over with, but that was hard as is. When the wife was walking, I didn't look at her, I couldn't, it hurt because she was someone I was excited to bring into the family until the fight. After it they were officially married, they said they ordered pizza, had chips and sodas and that was it for food. Of course, we didn't plan to stay for that, but my other brother, who was very Cleary drunk and the reason I will never drink, was veagn, he only ate eggs that were free range, that's it as far animal products go. I hate my drunk brother to, he's a terrible brother, but the sober one knows drunk is veagn and still didn't get him any vegen options but chips. \n\nWe after they were officially married, my father made a dumb speech knowing that me and my mom were in pain and wanted to get our as soon as possible. Then we left, I hated my father that day, he was pushing every button and seeing how far he could get with it. My mom clearly wanted to go back to the hotel as she stated it several times, but instead he took us for a drive around town for some site seeing while treating the situation like a joke. I was so angry with him all throughout the day, so much so that I didn't even hug him when he asked for it. I usually just bite my tongue and deal with his stupidity for my mom, but that day I just couldn't. He said I was being rude and my mom scolded him for saying it because he knew exactly why I ignored him, it was the same reason she was mad at him, only she's to nice to do what i did and bit her tounge and delt with it.\n\nIt was the worst day of my life and just wanted it to be over, we had to pick my drunk vegan brother up to get him something to eat since my other brother wouldn't. I didn't talk much to him because I hated it when he got drunk, and he knows that. He's very aggressive and easily angered when sober, when drunk or high, it was worse. That's why I hate alcohol and hate drugs, my mom says that at parties you have to drink the alcohol given to you, but when I turn of age for alcohol, I'm not doing that. My drunk brother asked my why I was so mad at him, it was because I was scared of him, one bad word and he'd start yelling at me, I can't take people speaking aggressively to me. So instead of answering him, I glared at him and scoffed before looking back at my food, which I barely touched, same with my mom. Then we finally got back to the hotel and I think the stress of everything finally caught up to me becuase i had panic attack. This was the first one my parents witnessed and so I was able to play it as as something bad I ate, and I went to hide in the bathroom to calm down before they got to suspicious. I calmed down, but I was still dizzy and couldn't walk straight, so my mom helped my to bed and I passed out not to long after. \n\nThat night I had the worst nightmare I ever had in a very long time. I get nightmares constantly, every night, for the past three years, so I've learned to deal with it. The usual pattern of the dreams are of someone or something chasing another person who's perspective I'm seeing from. Sometimes it's me, sometimes it's a character from one of my stories, sometimes it's just a random person. Each time I die a brutal death and sometimes, I feel a bit of the pain depending on the death. That nightmare, I was with my family, we were happy, we were actually on a family trip like we used to do all the time when I was in middle school. But then, the girl from the ring came and target me I tried to run and hit at her, but no luck, I felt her as she grabbed my arm and was about to bite down on it. Thats when the dream changed, my dreams usually go, creepy, nice, death. I delt with the creepy, then I got to spend time chilling in a tub as an otter with otter friends, now was the nightmare. \n\nI was back in school and they were giving away toys, candy and clothes for little kids, I'm a god mother so In my dream I picked out everything for my god child. Then, as I was leaving, the guy at the door grabbed my arm, the same place the ring girl did, and I felt the same pain. He told me something I can't remember and then let me go, I found it weird but my mom was waiting for me so I left and as I passed, everyone I passed said \"check your pockets\" they all also had red glowing eyes but dream me didn't notice at the time. That's when the death scene happend, I looked at someone who was a little taller then me and had shot spiky brown hair with the red glowing eyes with no mouth. I noticed his eyes and mentioned it, he then pulled a gun out of his pocket and shot me in the  throat and luckily i didn't feel that as i drowned in my own blood. I woke up immediately after and saw that same figure that shot me standing over me, i blinked and he was gone. I don't know if it was my mind playing tricks on me or if it was something else, but I didn't sleep for the rest of the night after that. \n\nThat whole day felt like a nightmare, and the actual nightmare I had that night did not make it better. I hate everything that's going on and I'd honestly prefer it if my parents just forgot about my brother, just stop mentioning him to me, I'm stable until he's brought up into conversation. I honestly want this real life nightmare to end, i don't know when that will be, but I hope it's soon... sorry for writting so much, it helps to type this all out, and I have a lot of pent rage to let put, so, sorry.",

    "postText": "I was at Target the other day and while standing in line waiting for one of the self checkouts I noticed a couple at one of the self registers.  They were both in their 20s and were standing there rigging up their orders.  As the woman rang up each item she put it into the basket of one of the store provided mobility scooters that the guy that she was with was sitting in.  \n\nI tried not to be judgmental.  I mean, maybe this guy has something going on, right?  Once they finished ringing up he drove the scooter to where they park them, picked up two bags out of the basket and one of those large bottles of detergent and the two of them began to walk outside, about 4 or 5 rows deep into the parking lot to where their car was.  \n\nLaziness like this is such a major pet peeve of mine.  Get off of your ass, you entitled prick.",

            "comment": "As someone with a legitimate handicap/mobility impairment this kind thing really pisses me off. Those scooters are often WAY too few at Target and Wal Mart. I can't tell you how many times I've gone in needing one and had none be available. So I have to sit at the front of the store and wait till someone using one is done, which is frustrating as hell. I try not to assume that someone doesn't need it based on them not having a visible disability, but in situations like you described where the person demonstrates being able bodied I get pretty pissed.",

    "postText": "hello I really wanted to get this off my chest and I dont rlly have anyone to talk to lmfao anyways I\u2019m a 15yr Native American girl, I live in a mostly white/Hispanic populated town and I hate it . So much . everytime I go out I get so many stares or some white old man starts looking at me like im a object I especially hate it when I\u2019m out with my dad, please don\u2019t get me wrong I love my dad but whenever I\u2019m out with him it\u2019s so much worse. One time I was out with my mom and while I was looking for food for my little brother a woman started yelling at me out of nowhere, I was just minding my own business.  Even one of my friends started calling me racist shit after i talked about what I\u2019ve gone through ngl that shit hurt so much I had finally felt like I had someone to talk too.\nP.S. : we havent lived in this town for long before me and my family moved we had lived in the rez.",

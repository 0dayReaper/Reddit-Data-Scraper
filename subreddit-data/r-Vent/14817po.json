I was going to move cities and study and then I changed my mind to continue my current studies in a place I hate but now I think I should move but I don\u2019t want to study the new thing. I cant form my own opinion anymore because everyone around me has very strong feelings about it. I don\u2019t really want to do any of it and I\u2019d like to live in the new place but not really have to make decisions to do anything. I don\u2019t know what 2 do.",

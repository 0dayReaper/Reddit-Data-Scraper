    "postText": "So this happened last summer, my uncle is a horrible person. Abusive, perverted, everything under the sun. One thing that sticks out to me is when I got my first real life boyfriend. I found out that he was asking my other family member if we were having s*x and told them to ask me and get details. It\u2019s just so creepy and fills me with a horrible feeling when I think about it. I used to love and trust this man and he was my father figure growing up. Now I see he is a perv and I just get in such a bad mood when I remember. Am I overreacting? I have no idea\u2026 anyone have any similar experiences? I\u2019m 16 but was 15 at the time.",

Wanna rent? Same. Oh just get your family to help, minus my parents and grandparents are all dead and I\u2019m the one everyone else looks to for help. Just save? Nope every single time my account starts going up either the car breaks down or I have another funeral to pay for cause no one thought ahead. So I\u2019m just just supposed to work myself for death forever for nothing? Some straight bullshit and I don\u2019t wanna play this game anymore. Where\u2019s my fucking break? Just goddamn once. Fucking pointless anymore.",

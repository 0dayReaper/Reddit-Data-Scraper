    "postText": "My dad is what the memes would call a typical suburban dad. He works his 9-5, goes on some business trips, and mows the lawn/watches TV when he's home. \n\nI've had my speculations that one of my parents is either actively cheating or has cheated in the past, but I won't get into that here. For me, it's my relationship with my dad and how it's affected me into my adult life. \n\nI was never good enough for my father, and I'm still not. I was the type of kid to never come out of my room simply because I couldn't deal with the constant disapproval from my parents. On the rare occasions I would be out of my room, I'd be met with criticism and aggressive complaining (mostly from my dad) that I simply wouldn't know what to respond with. When I did respond because I was often forced to, it didn't matter what I said. I'd be screamed at. Eventually I just became numb to it. \n\nAll of this branched into my schooling during the time. I was turned into a complete perfectionist. So much so that I'd procrastinate on things if I knew/felt I couldn't do them perfectly right away. This led to getting so far behind in school that I'm surprised I even got my diploma. (My grades were off the charts when I actually did my homework) \n\nAfter the age of 12, my parents offered little-to-no guidance unless I came to them myself. My dad especially. So here I was, lost and confused about life as an adolescent. I didn't know what I was supposed to do, so I'd get yelled at profusely for not doing what he never told me to do in the first place... If that makes sense. \n\nI don't talk to my dad much anymore. He'll call me from time-to-time, but other than that our relationship is dwindling. It pains me that I don't know how to approach him without already feeling some guilt for literally no reason. I always feel like I need to be on edge or that I need to be apologizing for existing. \n\nOh, and before you suggest trying to talk it out, I have already. Several times over the course of a decade. He either dismisses it, twists the blame onto me almost immediately, gets defensive, yells and screams, or turns it into a century-long lecture that must (of course) include every wrongdoing I've ever done and I don't have the right to complain blah blah blah\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading my rant.",

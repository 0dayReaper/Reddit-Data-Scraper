I could bore you with details,  but long story short,  I'm the product of the U.S. drug trade and the Cartels.  \n\nThe United States is doing nothing about the following drugs: cocheese,, meat, and fet.  I have brothers killing for this.  Not even military. The United States is poison ivy. Beware.",

But I don't know. \n\nI'm going to assume that you were a drug mule and they shoved drugs up your butt and smuggled you across the border.",

That's kind of the point of making a post.\n\nEven on here. If you really wanted to just vent you would write it down in a journal or tell a friend. Anytime you post online you are saying \"please interact!\"\n\nThat's the point of the internet.\n\nThe tone I was going for was a lot more jovial and fun than actual criticism so that's hard to put across online. So that part's definitely on me\n\nBut you'd think somebody who went through what you did would have pretty thick skin and be able to identify jokes but maybe I'm wrong.",

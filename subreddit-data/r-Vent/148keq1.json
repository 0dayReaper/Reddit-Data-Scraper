    "postText": "For context I am professionally diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Every single morning my boyfriend (LDR) sends me a good morning text the second he wakes up. Today I messaged him \u201cI miss you &gt;:[\u201c 2 hours after he didn\u2019t respond to my initial good morning message. He replied immediately \u201cOmg did I not say good morning?! Wtf I woke up like an hour ago\u201d and I said \u201cNope.. :(\u201c and he said \u201cbut brb hang on I need to get ready for an appointment\u201d\n\nHe has diagnosed ADHD. Sometimes he forgets a lot of things. Sometimes he forgets to text me back. Sometimes he gets distracted by things and forgets the rest of the world exists. I understand that. I get it. \n\nBut I\u2019m kind of here like\u2026. \u201cDoes he not think about me in the morning..?\u201d and it\u2019s really making me spiral very bad. Idk I can give some more context if anyone has quest\u00eeons to better understand the situation. But am I wrong for spiraling really bad over this???",

    "postText": "For context I struggle with several mental disorders. Anxiety, depression, PTSD, and DID being the most prevalent. I do find DID to be the absolute worst though, I would not wish this upon anyone. \n\nI absolutely hate how lonely I feel because of it, people either treat me like I\u2019m some kind of performance or like I\u2019m a ticking time bomb that they have to keep an eye on for their own safety. \n\nI just want to have normal friendships man, I want to be able to get a job and go out and have fun with people without worrying about losing hours of it to amnesia. I want someone who will listen to me and want to hang out with me without feeling like there\u2019s some kind of danger involved with it.\n\nMy girlfriend is wonderful, she\u2019s the only person I have to talk to anymore. She makes it a point not to be ashamed of me and my disorder, openly posting about our relationship with my permission. On one of her TikToks about us someone asked why someone like her was dating a \u201ccharity case\u201d and it\u2019s hard not to feel like she deserves better. Realistically I know it was just some asshole with nothing better to do but god damn does it hurt hearing your own negative thoughts echoed back by someone else. \n\nMy family refuses to believe me, my sister openly mocking me and my struggles to anyone who will listen saying I\u2019m faking everything. (I have been officially diagnosed with everything by a therapist) \n\nI just want someone to talk to, the loneliness is crushing",

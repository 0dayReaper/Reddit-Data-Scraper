    "postText": "So my BF was trying to help me with my credit so he added me to his Amex card with a pretty high limit. It helped a little bit and I was able to get another credit card for having that one and kept it in a good standing.\n\nRecently my bf had a few expenses (that I wasn't aware of) and he maxed out the card we are on which made my credit score drop 72 points. \n\nI was upset.\nHe however isn't taking any responsibility for my drop in score because he said I shouldn't of put myself on his account.\nObviously yes, I shouldn't have \"put myself\" on his card in the first place but I trusted him and he does for the most part have good credit and does at least make the min payments on time. \n\nHowever....does he REALLY not have any responsibility? He keeps just saying that it's MY fault it happened and he doesn't need to apologize for anything.\n\nKeep in mind I did have 2 other cc on my account at the time of the credit pull both of them were at 1% utilization. \nWhen I got my alert the ONLY change to my credit  score was the credit increase on the Amex. \n\nAm I being selfish for wanting an apology from him?",

I understand unexpected expenses can pop up but I would give her a heads up if I needed to max it out. It boosted her score a 100 points when I added her,which helps us both for our future. He can easily take you off the card and I think you should consider that.",

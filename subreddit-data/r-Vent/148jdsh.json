    "postText": "Hi, first of all, sorry if there are any mistakes here or if the text is too messy, english is not my first language and i'm really bad at wording.\r  \n\r  \nI'm male, soon to be 24y and gay.\r  \n\r  \nI've been feeling really lost lately, more than ever. I'm at uni now, for the second time, studying something i'm relatively passionate about, but I don't think thats enough. My problem is that i can't bring myself to work on the assingments, I feel this imense dread, I feel lazy, useless and dead weight at this point.\r  \n\r  \nMy parents are paying for my uni, they payed 2 and half years for the first time, until I had to drop out cuz I was really bad mentally due to a break up and I wasn't happy with the course i was studying. I took a gap year, i had therapy and got a job to fill my time and finally was able to get to uni again, now in a course i liked more although there were some problem and i only got admited almost 2 months late, which really demotivated me and was way hard for me to catch up.\r  \n\r  \nI feel like my mental health never really improved, therapy didn't help much more than just having someone to talk to about my problems. On the last 3 years, I had 2 therapists: the first that was really pushing me to have a relationship with my mother, something that i wasnt really happy about since she was really emocional and verbal abusive until to day; and the second one that I think that helped me more, but sometime i didn't feel heard.\r  \n\r  \nBoth of these therapists focused too much on my break up and how it affected me, and even tho i was really attached to him, the problems i had (always being sad, 0 motivation, anxiety, unalive thoughts etc) were not new, i had them for years, and the break up was only the last drop for me. I never got diagnosed with depression, and still to this day i don't understand why i feel so empty, sad and with no motivation for anything. I don't know if i didnt explain myself properly to the professionals, or if im just delusional and lazy.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI can't count with my parents for these emocional problems, since they are the origin of the majority of them. From my mom laughting cuz she thought I had left her an unalive letter when i wrote to her about me coming out, to when i actually wrote her about wanting to off myself, and she told me in the middle of a zoom class \"You know, all the artists worked best when they were bad mentally. Study.\".. Telling me she should have never had me, that she would run away, that when she and my father spent day arguing, she made sure to go to my room and tell me that \"this is all your fault.\". And my dad did basically nothing.\r  \n\r  \nI'm gratefull that they are paying for my things, and that they gave me a second oportunity. I moved to a different city 3h away from home to study, and once again I'm feeling terrible.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nRight now, I've a bunch os assignments that I should have started weeks ago, I don't have any money already cuz i spent it all on food and leisure (another problem, one of my coping is spending money), I barely have any food left for the rest of the month, I simply can't ask my parents for more money cuz I should have plenty, I don't want to ask my friends cuz they helped me enought already, since this happens almost every month, and reaching a point that i wish i would just disappear.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI'm all wrong, almost mid 20's and I still feel like a child, I can't do anything alone, I can't manage myself, I cant focus on anything, literally nothing in my life is going well. I feel like a waste of space and oportunity. Other people on my place would be thriving, while i'm just stuck. Therapy didn't help me, i feel ashamed to even talk about my mental health with my parents.. i'm hopeless.",

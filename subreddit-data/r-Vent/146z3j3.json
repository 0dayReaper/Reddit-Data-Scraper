To try and point out where mummy lived. \nHe basically broke in to my mums house dressed as BATMAN??? \nBoth to try get her back , since she broke up with him. \nHe got a tattoo of mine and my brothers initials, but not for us, to try win her back since she likes tattoos. \nHe started motorcycle lessons because my mum rode a bike. \nKeep in mind, me and my brother were less than both 10 at the time. \nI'm?

    "postText": "I hate the fact that I am missing my daughters 5th Birthday. I miss my girls so much. We had such a great bond.  \n\n\nMy wife and I are separated. She would not allow the kids to meet me. I have repeatedly asked my wife to spend time with my kids. It has been six months since I saw or spoke with them. She keeps blackmailing me which is forcing me to just maintain the status quo.   \n\n\nIt hurts so bad.\n\n.",

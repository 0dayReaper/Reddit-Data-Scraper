And if I don't try then I still feel bad because then I feel like I'm stuck or selfish. Like if I'm trying to go out of my way to do something nice for someone, can it please just go okay and be completely normal? Please, for once.\n\nBecause more and more I'm starting to feel like the only way to get ahead in life or be happy is to be completely selfish. Like I don't know everything about everyone's life, I get that everyone has problems, but it really seems like the people who are selfish are doing exceptionally well in life. But I guess I'm dumb that I feel bad about not doing more, because it's really nice when someone helps you or does something to show that they think of you.",

Be really selfish, nothing bad happens.  I'm an atheist, but this formula happens so often that I've actually begun to question if there actually is some sort of divine being intentionally punishing acts of kindness.  I get legitimately scared every time I help someone in need because I know that something really bad is going to happen soon afterwards.  I'm both disturbed and kind of relieved that I'm not the only person out there that has noticed this.",

She has terrible luck, not just with little things going wrong but with her health too. Meanwhile some of the people who she helps who are very selfish, have amazing luck. I'm sure it's not just that things fall into their lap, they go after what they want, but part of having that effort work out is luck, and selfishness too. So I'm trying to convince her to be more selfish as well, so that she can finally get what she wants.",

No one is going to appreciate your effort more than your future self and only the people who will admire your personal growth will be grateful for your kindness and all that you do. That has been my experience recently. I hope everything turns out well for you.",

And, it's also okay to be selfish sometimes, being good to other people doesn't mean you should accept them treating you badly. And, from experience, sometimes doing something out of the goodness of your heart doesn't pay off, it's okay to understand that you did the right thing but it still didn't pay off.",

I'm not doing it for a reward, I get that things don't always go how you plan, but to have things get worse every time is messed up. \n\nBut I've learned my lesson. I'm not going out of my way to make things worse for anyone, but I'm not going out of my way to help anyone either. I am accepting the limitations that life has seen fit to give me. Same with my health problems. I'm done. I'd rather feel the uniform frustration of feeling limited than to have ups and downs of anxiety and physical discomfort. If they get better on their own, great, if not at least I know things won't be getting way worse.",

I'm sorry someone made you feel like you owe strangers something, but not all people need to be activists or go out of their way to do good deeds every day. It sounds like you need serious YOU time, and to focus on solving the obstacles in your life and getting your life in a better place. Once you are comfortable and this is not an impediment, if it's within your possibilities you can do a good deed, and it doesn't even have to be by dealing directly with the people that need help. I hope your situation gets better.",

It wasn't even something big, just spending time with family that are getting older. That's what I don't get, it's a perfectly ordinary thing that people do all the damn time, and at the end I get to feel shittier than if I hadn't put forth the effort, not just because of my stupid anxiety but because of shitty luck. I don't want a lot out of life, I don't want to live in luxury and have constant fun and attention. I just want to make enough money to support myself, be somewhat healthy and occasionally have fun. That's it. But I won't get that because life just wants to fuck with me. \n\nLike I took the day off today a few months ago to enjoy some time outside. Nope, fuck me, it's 66 and raining today, even though it's June. Tomorrow when I'm back at work it'll be 77 and sunny of course. Or if I decide to get a lot if cleaning done then of course my neck pain needs to flare up, god forbid I get all the cleaning done in one day. I am tired of the bad luck and struggling with the basics of life. I feel like it is just getting worse year after year.",

    "postText": "I've dealt with anxiety and depression my whole life. From what I've been told, I got a PTSD diagnosis by the time I was 6 from my great grandma dying, but I don't think that was the only reason. \nMy mom is an addict who was constantly in and out of my life. My dad isn't emotionally invested in me and dealt with alcoholism throughout my life. \nThe rest of my family is just extremely traumatized themselves and uneducated on what's healthy and normal. \nLike, often times I'll be telling what I think is a funny story and by the end of it, people are asking if I'm okay but my entire family would have laughed with me... We're a messed up bunch. \n\nI know now as an adult that I'm autistic, ADHD,  cPTSD, chronic depression, and anxiety that's triggered by the symptoms of my other conditions. I can't afford the $3000+ to get a legal diagnosis, but I have spent over 3 years studying mental health, buying expensive college and doctors books just to make sure I had the correct info, spent hours talking to off the clock therapists and other people who are diagnosed. \n\nMy other huge issue is that I have chronic health issues like fatigue, upset stomach, dizziness and feinting, pain, headaches, etc.  \n\nI have tried the diets, the yoga, the meditation, the cardio, the being out in nature, the staying inside and being clean, sleeping excessively, scheduling sleep, medications, etc. There isn't a \"cure\" and they can't even find any actual cause of this stuff, so I'm not actually diagnosed with anything physical except scoliosis and it's not severe enough to be considered debilitating. \n\nI haven't held a job in over 3 years due to my health, but I don't qualify for disability. I make roughly $150 a month in cash from helping my family members with things, but that just barely covers my phone bill. My car has been unregistered and uninsured since last September. I have a service dog and a senior dog I don't know if I can keep for much longer, but they are my whole world. \n\nI've been homeless, and even then, I only got 30 dollars in donations in a year to help get a diagnosis and help with poverty. \n\nI'm currently living with my very toxic family. I'm caregiving for my Gramma as a work trade, but when she passes, I will be on the streets with nothing again. I'm really really scared and I just don't see much of a reason to wait around and suffer just to end up suffering more. \n\nI've been trying to do adult education on and off for several years to get my diploma and get into programs for job placement, but every job I've ever tried, the absolute longest I've lasted is one year. Most jobs don't even last through the first week though. I even go in crying, puking, and a mess because if I don't show up, I'll get fired, but then I'm a gross mess and they don't want me to work anyway and tell me maybe I should focus on my health before trying to work. I can't afford to stay home and get healthy without having income. Even showing up through my worst days isn't enough for people..\n\nEveryone knows I'm AuDHD because I can't shut up about the thing that finally made my whole existence make sense. No one understands me, so I had to understand myself and now that I do, it's a special interest because it's fulfilling to me. \n\nEven then, when I act AuDHD, I get in trouble or people get emotional and take it personally, even though I feel like I'm burnt out and having to mask 24/7, apparently it's not enough. I get freeze response really bad so I go mute and cannot move until I'm left completely alone for several minutes. I'm assuming that's due to trauma and being punished for anything I said or did, even if it was adjusting my body to be more comfortable. So I just don't move or speak when I'm in some kind of potentially hostile situation... That also gets me in \"trouble\". Removing myself from over stimulation without making a scene gets me in \"trouble\". Crying/sniffling gets me in \"trouble\". \n\nI've been getting lectured about not bringing in any money to the house, so I'm really scared about what that is going to mean for me. I caretake, do a lot of chores, and use my own food stamps to buy food for the house (which isn't even allowed technically). \n\nI just can't do anything right. I can't hold a job or find a way to make money (I've tried physical labor, desk jobs, food industry, animal industry, part time, full time, with a team, independent, making art, growing things, MLMs even...). The whole world revolves around how much money you can make. It takes time and energy to make money. All of my time and energy are currently spent taking care of others and resting in between that. Even if I got a job, I probably wouldn't be able to work more than 2-6 hours in a week, and that's if I was even able to not have a flare up or meltdown and show up in the first place. \n\nI can't afford proper healthcare. I can barely afford to eat more than one meal a day and I still end up out of food and scraping by at the end of the month. \n\nI'm just completely hopeless at this point. It's not getting better for anyone, it's getting worse. I keep hearing \"oh just keep going, it'll get better\" but like, did it really get better for all of the other poor abused people who lived and died trying their hardest in hopes of \"making it\" financially? No. No it didn't. And I am not different. I'm not special. I'm not the exception. I'm disabled without any of the accomodations or assistance. So by the government/societies standards, I'm just a lazy, worthless, incapable piece of trash who deserves to suffer or be imprisoned simply because I am incapable of providing for myself in this particular social system that was not made with disabled people's existence in mind. \n\nThe unemployment and unaliving rates in the Autistic community are HIGH. I try and share a lot of info on that because I don't want anyone to be surprised when I'm not here anymore. I've been sad and not wanting to be alive since I was probably 5 or so. I just keep sticking around cause I hear \"it'll get better when you grow up and have your own house and stuff\".. Well I'm grown up and have only lived on my own once, when I was homeless. It wasn't better. It doesn't get better, so I just don't know what I'm doing wasting my time. \n\nI don't see why it's such a bad thing to not want to suffer. I feel like it's more selfish to invalidate someone relieving their pain and suffering just because you'll \"miss them\", even though you don't even treat them well in their daily life. The only reason I'm still here is because I'm scared of what I don't know. \n\nBut damn, I pray every night that it will be my last and I just won't wake up tomorrow and every morning, I'm disappointed and scared that I have yet another day I have to face.",

Life has a purpose rather it\u2019s the smallest or the biggest effect on your life or another. There\u2019s a purpose. Just keep stronger and carry on. I feel for you very much. But life indeed is worth of staying.\n\nMuch love your way.",

But yeah, getting that money back is more headache for you, and you'll make that back eventually.\n\nI have an ex-friend that slashed my tires and broke my then boyfriend's (now husband) computer, and for that he owes me probably $1,800. But that was almost ten years ago and I'm much happier now that he's gone off to be a piece of shit far away from me. We definitely make a good amount now and are happy. Outta sight, outta mind.",

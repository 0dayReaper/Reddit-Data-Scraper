    "postText": "So she gave him away a couple months ago &amp; just a couple weeks ago I got a rabbit. She gave him away bc \"I wouldn't take care of him\". I was the only one who would take care of him. The real reason why she gave him away is because hes a male American bully that wasn't spayed or neutered even tho I told her too &amp; because he was a very playful dog so we would get a couple of scratches here and there but the main reason was because he would gave accidents in the house. So one day my brothers friend came to get Drace (My dog) and \"sell\" him to the friend. I didnt even get to properly say goodbye to Draco. Then I got a bunny a couple months later. There name is Jasper (idk the gender yet). So today I heard my brother talking about getting a female dog and that he cant wait. So what the fucking point of getting rid of Draco just to get another dog and I'm sure damn well your not going to fucking take care of it. Idk wtf to do I'm so fucking done living here. I just want to get away.",

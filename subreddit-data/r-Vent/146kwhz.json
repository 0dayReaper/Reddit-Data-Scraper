    "postText": "Yea I\u2019m basically my parents are guilt tripping me into giving them all of my birthday money (which is in the thousands) and listen, I\u2019m gonna sound like a spoiled kid, but sometimes I wish they wouldn\u2019t tell me stuff that I already know. All of our fucking money goes into softball which is a sport that I hate now, but I\u2019m still playing it for the small chance I go to college for it. Then they tell me (their child) their financial struggles which I already know and worry about, and this makes me feel like a douchebag for acting selfish. Idk man I just have a lot on my mind and this is really pushing it.",

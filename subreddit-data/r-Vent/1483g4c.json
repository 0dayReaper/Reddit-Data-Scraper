    "postText": "So yeah taking computer science in software engineering because I have no fucking clue why I don't even remember how I end up here. It's even more confusing now that I managed to be in 3rd year and doing my final phase of my final project which I have not even done and it's due in 2 days lmfao. I just don't give a damn about this anymore because I have 0 interest in this I am doing poorly in it anyway. Yeah people keep saying just push through but I have been pushing myself swallowing something I hate and don't care about since second year and I am sick and tired of it. My only hope is they'll give me pity grade so I can just be done with this with bare minimum as long as I passed. Yeah I fucked up and I know it, that's why I wanna be done with it so I can move on and learn other things I actually cared about and be good at it. I'm not planning to relax at all, lately my passion in aviation came back instead of doing all this computer science code or whatever I ended up distracted learning about flight procedure, instrument, and anything involving it. As you can see now yes I am considering to go to flight school hoping to pursue something I genuinely care and want to do. This is the reason why I want to be done with it and look for (hopefully) financial aid/scholarship or something to finance flight school.  \n\n\nOr maybe I'm just delusional, having an unrealistic expectation idk. My friend told me about tech industry salary reaching 6 figures, indoor workplace with air conditioning, and whatever tech industry related things but somehow none of it tempt me at all I just don't like it. I can't put my finger why I think I just don't give a shit about it. I might as well pursue something else I am passionate about than losing my sanity.  \n\n\nThat's it fellas have a nice day :)",

I would say just keep doing what your doing, and if you don't get through it, at least you have the satisfaction of knowing you tried, which is more than what other people can say. You got this, bro! Keep your head up.",

Last month I was so empty that when I talk to my parents they are scared and worried because \"This is not you we are talking with\" it scared me too. I am so empty too empty I don't even feel alive for a week. But then youtube recommend me a video of how plane cockpit works and it came back again, all the sudden I feel a purpose once more to pursue something I am genuinely interested in since I am 7 years old. Now all I need is to find a way to finance it and you bet your ass I will work hard on it.   \n\n\nOh also I hope you are doing well too, check on your friends and loved ones as well!",

I also don't care if you're eating junk food or smoking a cigarette  (and keeping the second hand smoke to yourself) or hurting yourself in some other way that brings you enjoyment and doesn't hurt others. But hurting *others* is different, I would criticise you for consuming animal products as that's no longer just a personal decision, sure it's unhealthy, but the problem is you're being highly unethical to animals by paying for their death and abuse, and also dooming us all by causing climate change.\n\nSo I want to make a distinction between people who care about what you're eating for a stupid reason, and people who have a very good reason for caring what you're eating. No, you will not be left in peace, until you leave the animals and the planet in peace. You do not have the right to do whatever you want at the expense of others.",

I put ranch in spaghetti like meals in school, its so bland and the ranch adds flavor but I can't do it without getting disgusted looks and talking about how disgusting I am and it's really annoying. I'd like to eat in peace without your comments. (I only sit with my friends, so.. it's even more annoying. Lately I've just given up and not enjoying food so it pleases the ppl at my table)",

    "postText": "First of all very unrelated, I\u2019m so sorry to hear about some of the things I\u2019m reading on here, I\u2019m new. Anyways, I\u2019m not completely alone and blessed with a lot of good supportive people but let me explain. I lost my friends due to one bad apple. This happened to me in highschool. I was \u201cpopular\u201d and had some good friends. One guy came along who was just known as kind of a bully, granted I take some things to heart, specifically if I feel like I\u2019m being targeted or picked on/not treated the same as others around me. It put me in such a bad place and confusion for so many years like why? I stick up for myself and it only gets worse. Fast forward I healed, found some lifetime friends, and a ton of confidence again. I then starting branching out to bigger friend groups again and ran into some problems but dealt with them. A new guy again came into the group, well new to me but other guys knew him longer than me. Physically, not aggressive at all, mentally, one of the most relentless weird two faced bullies I\u2019ve ever met. Again, stood up for myself and only got made fun of more. It\u2019s like the minute someone knows they\u2019ve gotten to me it opens up that I\u2019m just the easy one to bully. And I know that\u2019s how it works but like why is your goal in the first place to relentlessly pick at me until I get there? Well I had a huge falling out and basically it\u2019s gonna make it so I kinda just have to distance myself for my own good. So once again I\u2019ve lost almost all my friends cause one person had some weird desire to have it out for me.",

Who knows what it was.  Maybe something you said, or how you said it, or maybe you just look like someone that hurt them.  People with low empathy tend to inflict their pain on others rather than learn and become better people as a result of experiencing it.",

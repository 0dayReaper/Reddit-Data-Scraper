    "postText": "Hello everyone! I'm just ranting, so please just listen. \nFirst of all, I just wanna say I hate everything. I don't have any motivation to go further in life. I hate how other people lie, cheat, and manipulate. Even seeing pain everywhere doesn't help it's trigging to the point that I want to disappear. Everywhere I go people are full of bullshit and especially nowadays it's really hard for me to find decent people. Partially it's my fault because I have been living in abuse for a long long time. So, I'm sure that contributes to it. \nMy life keeps getting worse every year and I'm growing old. I don't want to get married or think about love. I don't find love or romance interesting. I just hate it. I have been single for most of my life and want to die single. I just don't think I was meant to be born. I'm sure people have struggles. I have been struggling for soo long. I just can't do this anymore. The world is so awful. I can't imagine living anymore. As I grow up, my mental health keeps getting worse. I can't even control it. I didn't want to spend my life in just my room but I was forced into it. Now I don't think it's a bad idea. Someone pls I know it gets better but then again it gets worse. I keep missing my old life and how carefree and happy I was. Now I'm sad, depressed, have mental health problems and so much more. \nEvery time I express my problems. I'm bombarded with comments like people have it worse and stuff like that. I 100% understand that. I do agree that I might be blessed in some ways. But I'm not so much blessed in other ways. Nobody listened or ever care for me except my dad. I miss my dad a lot and my life ended to some extent after he died. It almost feels like it is over but I'm just breathing and living like a ghost.",

I am sorry to hear you are stuck in the pit.\n\nMy life has not been the same since my father passed, and I struggle with avoiding depression every single day.\n\nI spent enough time in the pit to know that I do not want to live my life there, and I certainly do not wish that on anyone else.\n\nI know this is probably hard for you to believe, but the best way to get out of the pit is to think positively. I know that is hard when you feel run down, everything seems bad, and people make it worse.\n\nIf you need someone to talk to, I am here.",

That is okay sometimes, even if you have to be your own support system for a while. Don\u2019t minimize what you lived through. It sounds like you went through hell, and stepped out the other side (hopefully). It will always be part of you. Now, how can you use that to feel fulfilled?  How can you turn it into your super power?  It sounds cliche\u2019 but don\u2019t underestimate how strong the human will can be. There is so much life out there, so many different stories for you to live. Don\u2019t let your past fool you into thinking you only have one story. That just isn\u2019t true. You gotta fight for it though. \n\nI am thinking of you OP and I wish you well.",

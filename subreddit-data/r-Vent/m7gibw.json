What I failed to realize is that this was apparently just tinder....for kids...\n\nThe things I saw were horrifying. 15 year olds posting videos of themselves twerking. 14 year olds calling themselves \"bottoms\". 13 years olds putting shit in their bios like \"ill send if you send \ud83d\ude09\"\n\nLike seriously, wtf? Why is this app even allowed to exist? I reported the worst of it, but honestly almost all of the profiles are extremely sexual. These are literal. Children. I honestly feel that authorities need to get on this, because this app is just blatantly allowing kids to post things that are going to get them taken advantage of, both by people their age and adult catfishers. \n\nI dont even know what else to say but im appaled.",

I'm not against the idea of apps that let kids make friends if it was a safe platform it could prove really cool for introvert kids or antisocial kids or even kids that have traumas and can't trust other kids face to face. But that would be nearly impossible they could make it necessary for kids to verify their identify, this way cutting off potential adult predators, this would also mean that kids would most certainly have to ask their parents for permission to which is great but there's no way to guarantee that will work 100% correctly. On the other hand they'd have to deal with all the kids promoting their bodies and things like that, it's normal to explore in those ages I agree but promoting it is a whole 'nother level. They could certainly filter their profiles if that's what they are, I honestly don't know how these apps work as I haven't used any not even for adults but from what I read on the post these kids have profiles so it's ultimately a social network for kids, they can filter their profiles but what guarantee do we have they won't expose themselves on chats? The only way would be to literally invade their privacy, either in an internal process where the company makes the analysis of the content shared by the kids or on an external process where the profiles and chats are available for parents to see, but both situations are, again, an invasion of privacy not to mention the security issue because if parents can access these contents, so can hackers. Given the circumstances I believe it's just unviable, which makes me wonder, how are these even allowed?",

I allow her to have freedom and she knows I can see her search history and such from my phone. I'll let her talk to her friends privately. As long as I know who she's talking to, i don't check it all the time. When she begins to act strangely that's the first thing I'll check. I'll ask her if anything happened between her friends or if someone said something inappropriate. The only time that happened was when she had an argument with her friend and they were cussing at each other. \n\nAll her added contacts have to be approved by me or my husband. Messenger kids is really helpful because she can add her friends but we get a message so we can review. I have a parental lock on her google play store. She was frustrated when she couldn't update spotify because she didn't know that it was rated t in the app store. I didn't either, but after I told her she was like \"oh okay. I'll just ask you when it needs to be updated.\" And now she'll come to me and ask to update it. \n\nWe have a rule in our house, every night she has to charge it downstairs. If it's not on the side table we'll ask her for it. Sometimes it's just her innocently forgetting. Rarely is she hiding things. Sometimes it's just because she wants to play a game for longer, or she's watching a new episode of a youtube show (she loves these animal channels). If we suspect anything we'll flat out ask her and if she wants she'll confide in us. If she doesn't we'll tell her \"Okay, we just want to make sure you're safe. I'm going to just look at your phone tonight. If I find anything that we specifically told you not to do on it we'll talk about it in the morning or you can come down and we can look together.\" Usually it'll be something minor like her youtube searching \"anime kissing videos\" and we'll talk about how some of those videos aren't very appropriate for her age but we understand that she is curious about such things. \n\nAs long as she's not going on sites that advertise hentai or porn I'm totally chill. Even then I'm like \"yo, this isn't something you should be looking at.\" I don't want to freak like my mom did and her go behind my back and stop talking to me. We have a very open relationship and she comes to me more often than I have to go to her.",

There was this online chat game called \u201cHabbo Hotel\u201d when I was 8 and my mom weren\u2019t too happy about me playing it knowing there were strangers talking on there. So eventually she forbade me to play it, and being 8 yrs old at the time I remember being crushed! Then having an 11 year old younger sister our experience with computer supervision is totally different. My parents placed the family computer in the living room to keep an eye on me. My 12yr old sister has has zero supervision on what she does online. She has her own iPad, phone and computer in her room. It\u2019s also so normalized to speak with strangers online compared to only a couple of years ago. Time has certainly changed. Glad knowing at least one parent tries to keep their children away from the bad sides of social media as long as possible.",

I told her about how she was still a bit too young to be looking at things like that. I understood she is becoming curious but I still talked to her about it. As long as she's not seeking out hentai I'll be chill about it. She hasn't since and I think her knowing that I'll know but won't get mad kinda killed it for her.

So it makes young people brave, and opens things up much faster in a much more inappropriate way. You say it\u2019s nice because you can have long talks and get to know someone. Well, we used to do that before social media too, but we would do it in person. Or over the phone where you could hear their voice. And have a real conversation where there wasn\u2019t time between each response to careful plot out what you were going to say next. It was natural. And in those natural responses, you begin to fall in love with the person. Now it feels like you have a couple conversations online, you THINK you know the person, and by the time you get to meet up with them, they expect sex. And then half the time it turns out that person wasn\u2019t really who you thought they were... just who they wanted you to think they were.  \n\nRomance 100% exists.

I'm a confident woman, and IDGAF what people think of me or what they do and I don't care to be like them. I've paved my own way. I don't need to fit in and I don't want to. I know lots of young people are susceptible to fall for lots of shit as they're young, inexperienced and somewhat ignorant, but I still think it's entirely possible to avoid falling down the rabbit hole of social media addiction. It requires some conscious effort, and I know teens aren't exactly very  conscious or aware of how things affect them, but if I managed to question this shit as a teen and didn't become a victim of social media, then other teens are able to too imo!",

    "postText": "Tw - Pet disease, health anxiety, health issues, pet loss mention\n\nHi all, \n\nI have been hesitant whether to reach out to people outside of my partner, because I typically keep things which are really bothering me to myself. \n\nAlthough, I am really struggling (not in any risk or anything like that of harm) and I just really think it may be beneficial to vent to people other than my partner. \n\nIf you read this all, thank you and I would love to hear any input. \n\nI have suffered from mental illness my whole life. When things go wrong, they make me mentally very unwell. \n\nNow, I have a beautiful cat who is four years old. She has helped me through so much. I have had other pets before, but she is different. \n\nRecently, she has had health issues and is suspected to have a heart condition called HCM - progressive disease which more often leads to heart failure. I don't find out how much it's progressed or if it is confirmed that she has it until early August. \n\nVet info: the vet said she -may- not have it, but will need ultrasounds every year. Seems like she is at risk of it and one of her heart measurements were a bit off, so they're reassessing in Aug. \n\nI have also had my own health issues - which I have frightening symptoms of the C word, in which I am on the wait list for a sigmoidoscopy which will fall around August, too. \n\nHonestly, I am not coping. All of the stress from my high stress, customer service job (call centre) as well doesn't help. I am constantly thinking about these two issues, but mainly my cat.\n\nI can't even imagine life without her, and I have read so much online you wouldn't believe about HCM. There are so many mixed responses, from cats randomly passing from it with no warning, to cats living normal lives. The uncertainty is very hard on my anxiety.\n\nI don't know what to do or how to cope. I see a counsellor, i just started DBT group sessions, i try really hard to work on myself, i express myself to my partner. I just don't know what to do. This is out of my control and i can't deal with it.\n\nMy whole life revolves around her. I know some people may roll their eyes, but the bond I have with her is unlike anything. She has glued to my side for the past 4 years. \n\n\nThank you for reading. I really needed to get this out. As i said, I'm not at risk of harm, even if i sound like i am. I just really need somebody.",

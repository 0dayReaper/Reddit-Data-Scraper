    "postText": "[[Dear god I hope my friends dont see this because if they do I'm about to be completely fucked.]]\n\n\u25cfI [15yo] feel like I messed up my friendship with multiple people. \nI'm in my last year of school [year 9,European] and next year I'm moving to highschool. Thats veen nerve-wracking enough if it wasn't for this.\n\u25cfBasically today we had an entire day of practicing for our \"junior prom\". I was supposed to bring some USB with the music my class is going to dance to but I didn't bring it. \n--&gt;The reason was because I didn't know I had to bring it [apparently it was written in the class Teams group but I don't really check that,mistake on my part. My teacher also didn't say anything about it when I asked a couple days prior]. \n--&gt;My friend texted me [she was out sick today] and she asked me why I didn't bring the USB [I explained to her that I didn't know. She got a little irritated [I think] and said that that should've been obvious[I'm really bad at reading between the lines and I feel a little stupid about it because it was pretty obvious]. --&gt;She then said that multiple people from our class said that I told the teacher that my friend was supposed to bring the USB [thats not how I remember it,I don't even remember being asked about it but I might've misheard what was being asked or something.]\n\u25cfI feel really stupid about it because it seems kinda pointless to argue when we literally only have like 3 days of school left. Also since the majority says that I told the teacher that my friend was supposed to bring the USB I can't even argue back. I'm skipping tomorrow [that was preplanned] and am kinda hoping that the dust would settle by Wednesday [day of Junior prom]\n\n[Sorry for bad formatting, I'm on mobile|| sorry for weird/bad grammar, English is my 3rd language]",

    "postText": "I like to think that I\u2019m a hardworking person. I go to school (Im going to be a senior now in highschool) and then in the summers I start up my annual job. On top of that i take after school classes, sports, and music stuff. I\u2019m a very busy person now. But, my parents dont find that as an excuse to need rest. I\u2019m expected to come home and spend time with them for the rest of the night. I work all week as a dog washer (a more physically demanding job that one might not expect it to be, especially for a petite high school girl) and I spend my weekends doing extracurriculars for myself and for college. I dont really have time to rest and during the time i do have my parents want me downstairs and watching a movie with them every. single. night. I\u2019m often tired at work cause even sometimes they keep me up too late. And it\u2019s not like they guilt trip me either no, they will take stuff away from me. Ground me like im 12. And, even blame me for not being greatful. I\u2019m not allowed in my room anymore. only for when i have to sleep and i sleep at the time they want me to now. I dont know what to do.",

When they say no, tell them you will remember this when you move out, and also when they want to you to take care of them when they are elderly. You can let them know there are consequences, not just for you, but also for them. For the record, they\u2019re morons.",

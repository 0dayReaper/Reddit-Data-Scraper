    "postText": "So for a few months, I've been wearing only black. It looks elegant af. I don't have to overthink before I go out anymore, literally any 2 pieces work together and look amazing. I got quite a few high quality black pieces and I didn't need to get anything else since.\n\nI thought it was because maybe me being depressed a bit? But even after that, this is a thing that refuses to leave me. It's been a few months now but I guess it's too early to say.\n\nI also used to have beautiful long hair, that is until yesterday. I decided to go super short out of nowhere. I've been growing it out for 5 years, it was super worth it and I absolutely loved it.\n\nYet, yesterday I kinda felt like I don't identify with it anymore. Now it's all sleek and brushed back. Kinda looks like Tamino's hair. And I'm a girl. It's so easy to maintain and looks dazzling, nothing to think about, just finger brush it back and I'm done. \n\nPeople don't seem to like it as much as my long hair, but surprisingly, I don't give a shit. I love it, it suits me.\n\nFor some reason, this feels like a new beginning. I don't know why. I finally feel like myself. Simple and untethered.",

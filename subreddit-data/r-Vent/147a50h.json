    "postText": "My mother tried to orchestrate a meeting between my brothers and I with her. It was about a situation between one of my brothers and I. I had already communicated to my brother that I needed to talk to him. I wanted it to be just him and I because I know how outside influencers can trigger his defense mechanism. However, plans got ruined by my other brother who told our mother about our brother and I situation. The brother whom I wanted to reconcile with got defensive as I knew he would and things took a turn for the worse. We began to argue with foul language in front of our mother and began to tussle. My third brother who told our mother was the only person who could separate us because he\u2019s the largest in stature. All in all I feel terrible about how things transpired. I tussled with my brother whom I love dearly and I\u2019ve disappointed and embarrassed my mother. I\u2019ve since called and apologized deeply to my mother but the hurt I can never take back. My brother has reached out to me to talk, but I sent him the longest text message explaining my feelings on this issue and how much I cared for him but he never cared about recognizing the help. I\u2019m laying here in bed, can\u2019t sleep because this is weighing on me very heavily. This is the only place where I can post anonymously to get my thoughts off. Thank you for reading.",

So I ask for help, I say I\u2019m not ok, but no one helps or even stops to actually listen and honestly they do not seem to care. I know everyone has their lives and they cannot always give me attention or have the emotional energy to deal with me, but family wise I have no emotional support, actually most of my emotional problems come from there. \nS/O works and is not the listens and is empathetic about it kind of guy (don\u2019t get me wrong, he is caring, but in his own way). Plus, I\u2019ve been feeling this - I\u2019m tired of your bullshit - kind of vibes from him, so I wanna give him space to breathe for a bit. (Not sure if it\u2019s paranoia or not)\n\nI\u2019ve even talked with chatGPT about how I was feeling and to tell me bedtime story\u2019s so I can fall asleep without thinking about everything.\n\nI feel like I run, but I go nowhere. I scream for help and everyone is here but they can\u2019t hear me, I want to move but I just don\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019ve been having nightmares almost everyday for i think 3/4 weeks. I usually remember all of them (parts only) and I can even visualize it.\nMy memory is very short and I keep getting confused with what actually happened and feeling the anxiety from what happened awake, bc for a short period of time I have to think and understand if what I\u2019m feeling is about a real thing or did I dream about it.\n\nI just really wish I could talk to someone. \n\nBtw: i do have a therapist but I\u2019ve been trying to meet and she never can.",

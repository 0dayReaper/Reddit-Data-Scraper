    "postText": "Who would\u2019ve thought I\u2019d share this here lmao since it\u2019s anonymous I feel better about getting this off my chest and posting for anyone that relates. I was under the influence of ouid will typing this in my notes earlier so it\u2019s just pure word dump. Enjoy \n\n\nEveryday I think about the future. Not necessarily the future itself but the events that will happen when I get older. Being a mother, and being able to grow my own family and raising children is always on my mind. I think about the people I\u2019m gonna meet along the way who will understand my authentic self. I believe that people are meant for each other and sense a deep connection with those who get them. I honestly don\u2019t think anyone knows the real me. The raw person that I am when I\u2019m in a comfortable setting with a person. I sense vibes and sometimes keep my wall up when meeting new people. I constantly analyze body language and actions to determine a persons thoughts. I\u2019m not sure if thats classified as overthinking or being overly critical but it\u2019s something that I naturally do when connecting with humans. Everyday I think about the person that I will share my feelings and thoughts and life with. My soulmate. I believe they\u2019re out there and will eventually find me. Everything happens for a reason and is set out to complete its purpose when the time comes in that timeline. When I see children in public,  I cant help but think about my own. The bond between a child and parent is something so special to me. I do have conflicts when viewing the parenting world in this day and age due to climate change and globalization around the world, it truly worries me. I wouldn\u2019t want to bring my children into this horror of life if it\u2019s not needed. I have no problem with adopting but deep down I know that I am meant to be a mother and creating a little me is so surreal. I\u2019m nurturing, empathetic, and caring, I do things for people without being asked. I love to cook and I think that has to do with my love language being acts of service. I currently have two best friends but even them, I don\u2019t feel they know the real me. I\u2019ve know each of them since 5 years old. I keep certain things to myself to protect my peace. I don\u2019t like being lectured about my own hardships in life by other people who just don\u2019t get it. Maybe the day I meet someone who has experienced similar things like I have, will be the day I open up. I know that sounds selfish but it\u2019s hard for me to tell people what I go through. I rather comfort them and ask how they\u2019re doing, rather than focus on what\u2019s in my head. I\u2019m not sure why I do that, but I just pick up a vibe when I feel the need to lift a wall up. It sucks that I don\u2019t talk about my family life.. But it\u2019s because I feel that it\u2019s no one\u2019s business, it\u2019s not something I enjoy discussing. I love my family. My mom, my dad, my brother, I really do appreciate them, they did nothing wrong I just would rather not talk about the \u201cbad\u201d things. I would focus on the positives. I might say things in spite that I end up regretting later. If I\u2019m mad in the moment, I may shit talk them to other people but what\u2019s the point? I don\u2019t like hearing other people\u2019s opinions on my relationship and communication skills with MY family. It feels like an invasion of privacy. It\u2019s makes me feel sweaty thinking about it. I truly love them so even if they do me dirty, despite their actions I\u2019ll always respect them, my parents are special to me. I know they\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for me in the end. You know sometimes I feel really bad over the fact that I never invite my friends to my house. At first it was always because of having two dogs, it was always a hassle to handle the chaos between the guests and the dogs , so we just avoided it. Anyway fast forward to my dogs passing away, 10 years later, this meant people could come over! The thing is, how exciting that seems, I absolutely hate it. Not everyone views things like me, I see the best in the things. I try to find the good in everything. Whether it be a person, a place, or someone\u2019s living situation, I never judge. If I do, It\u2019s just my inner monologue pointing things out but never harmful. I don\u2019t say those things out loud ever because I am respectful and don\u2019t like being rude for no reason. Anyways, with that being said, like I just said, not everyone thinks like me, so it\u2019s hard for me to allow people into my space because i\u2019ve never really had people over in general. Just my family. It\u2019s always felt crowded, cluttered, and unorganized. I feel insecure about my home. It is my home so I personally don\u2019t hate it, and I\u2019ve been here for the majority of my life, so a new environment feels needed one day. It will obvious be when I\u2019m ready to leave the nest, but, having 4 family members in a decently small 2 bedroom apartment with only 1 bathroom can be quite a hassle. I\u2019m 18, my brother is 21 and my parents have basically outgrown their bedroom as well. Change is good and I believe the day we move out of this apartment, into a nice house, will be the day that my family will come together. When we have a kitchen that we can all help with cooking and not saying excuse me, and sorry for bumping into each other every 2 secs will be the day I cry of happy tears. I plan on making one of my famous pizzas with tons of basil for our first dinner in the new house. The day I\u2019ll have my own bathroom, or a shared one would be okay too. My brother isn\u2019t as bad as I perceived him. We used to bicker a lot as tweens, but I guess people change lol. \n\n12:46AM June 14th",

Self confidence is good but you must acknowledge at some point it\u2019s how others look at you. I workout and still I am ugly been doing it for 6 years now. I get comments like \u201cyour body looks good just not your face\u201d \u201cyour body a 10 but your face is a 2.\u201d I hate it. In fact it fills me with anger and pain. Why am I this way? It\u2019s not the fact I\u2019m choosing wrong people either I talk to everyone yet everyone has the same opinion I\u2019m ugly. I wish reincarnation was real because if I *blank* myself I would hopefully wake up in a better body. I didn\u2019t choose to be like this. Honestly thinking about *blanking* myself I can\u2019t take it. Everyone tells you not to care but it affects aspects of my life. I sometimes even wish I was a tall white boy with blond hair blue eyes nope I was born as a ugly mixed kid. I hate myself and I\u2019ve already accepted I\u2019m dying alone",

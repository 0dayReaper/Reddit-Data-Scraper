    "postText": "Just spent \u00a327 on Amazon for 2 journals... Started a new job a month ago and already thinking of leaving... It started off good and then got bad and now things are okay... Just want some stability... I'm failing my University course... My room's a mess... Want another craniosacral therapy session soon... Might get extensions, after I get paid, for the first time... Still borderline obsessed with I guy I slept with over 2 years ago who's blocked me... Missing my old counselling sessions and want to get more... Want to babysit the babes at the nursery I work at whom I love most but I'm not qualified yet (it's not favouritism, I just connect with some better than others which is natural/normal)... My social life isn't great by any means... The extensions are gonna cost around \u00a3350!... I can't get over that guy and just want my \"friend\" who isn't blocked by him to call him and get him to hang out but she won't and I feel like a desperate loser... Constantly in limbo.",

    "postText": "Maybe a little over a year ago when I was a freshman I began straightening and growing out my hair. At its longest it got to the length where the top would touch the tip of my nose on its own without me pulling it down.\n\nI really miss it man, it felt so cool and natural, that\u2019s the way straight hair has always looked to me. My naturally curly hair just looked so weird and kind of dirty. No matter how much product or stuff I do to it it has a lot of frizz and it goes out in every direction. My dad is a Spanish guy who had an Afro when he was my age, I take a lot from him and that probably has to do with it. Doesn\u2019t make it hurt any less tho. It feels like the real me, the confident me, the cool me has that straight hair. I feel attractive and good looking with that hair. I looked like Bruce from the Batman if he was healthy lol. \n\nIf I had the choice I would go with straight hair. Maybe a perm for that or something, since straightening doesn\u2019t really work anymore. I\u2019m very physically active so I sweat quite a bit, whenever I sweat my hair starts to curl again and it looks terrible. I didn\u2019t have much of choice since maintaining it was way too hard. For about a year I\u2019ve been going with my natural hair, getting different haircuts and ways to style it. It\u2019s cool and all but I still miss my straight hair y\u2019know? That\u2019s what I want to look like.",

    "postText": "I'm 14M btw. I feel like this world is so stale, everyone sucks, nobody is good enough to be my friend. Nobody lives up to my expectations, I don't feel like people give me enough attention. I also find myself wishing for like a perfect twin sibling, or anyone that is just like me. I realized this has been taking a toll on me, leading me to have intensive obsessions with fictional characters, feeling frustrated knowing nobody in the world will ever be like them, then become depressed. Help.",

It probably won't be as amazing as you expect it to be. But getting sucked into a fictional fantasy will do nothing to help that problem.\nAlso you seem horribly self absorbed. Nobody wants to \"give attention\" to someone who claims that people aren't good enough to be a friend. It's good to have standards but that is just egotistical. \nId recommend speaking to a therapist about what's going on in your head because none of what you said here is going to lead you to a happy life.",

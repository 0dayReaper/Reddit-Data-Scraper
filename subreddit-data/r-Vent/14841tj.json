    "postText": "I haven't posted in a while even though I've had a lot to vent about. There's so much shit going on in my life and I feel like I still have no time to process it fully.\n\nI know it's a little redundant to talk about having no privacy when posting about my private life on a public forum, but it doesn't bother me as much as the people that won't get off my ass.\n\nFor context, I was part of a big friend group like three years back. Long story short, things didn't end well and the group disbanded. I ended up dating one of the guys from the friend group and that didn't go well either. He's a narcissist and has some online stalker-like behavior. The girl he's dating now is practically a perfect fit for him.\n\nI did everything in my power to get as far away from the both of them as possible. I blocked them on everything and blocked anyone that tried sending messages to me that had anything to do with them. Yet after all I've been through, they're still finding ways to fuck with me and stress me out. As bad as my bio-grandfather who's also a huge narcissist.\n\nThese fucks messaged a friend of a friend and their message made its way to me. They essentially said that they know what they did wrong and they wanna try to be friends again with the people that supposedly \"hurt\" them. Those people are the ones that did the hurting. Nobody wants them back. I don't want them back. I don't understand why they can't leave me the fuck alone and let me be. I don't know what to do or how to get away from them.",

    "postText": "I'm F[23] diagnosed with schizophrenia and asd, meaning alot of stuff is hard for me. And I've been neglected and lest down alot in my life and I've seen my own parents die so you can see how much that can hurt someone. But yeah. Something I suffer alot with is my body image, because of my birthmarks, scars and chub. Having a job is also really hard for me because shit always happens in my life and its really hard to deal with it especially when I've only been diagnosed last year and haven't really learnt how to control anything about myself. I usually try put my body on sale for like some cash and that really breaks a person. But I have to be ready for the comments like \"ur birthmark just turns ppl away\" or \"I don't wanna buy from a fatass\". I have to be ready for those and it's on me for letting them get to me.",

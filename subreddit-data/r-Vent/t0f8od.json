I live in a safe country but I care about those innocent people. \n\nAnd maybe I am naive and some of you feel offended when I say this, but I hope you get me\u2026\n\nFUCK PUTIN, YOU BIG PIECE OF SHIT! AND FUCK EVERYONE WHO DOES WHAT HE SAYS!! KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE! WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU?!! I DON\u2019T GET SOLDIERS. JUST BLINDLY FOLLOWING CRUEL RULES! WOULD YOU KILL YOUR OWN FAMILY, IF THEY TOLD YOU TO??!\n\nI can\u2019t stop thinking about this innocent little 14 years old girl, who got murdered. Poor little baby \ud83d\ude25 Makes me so incredibly sad. Her parents were waiting for her to come home safely. But she will never arrive back home. I can\u2019t imagine the pain and suffering her parents are going through. And all those other innocent civilians. \nIt breaks my heart. No one deserves this shitty war. \nI have so much more to say about it, but I won\u2019t. \n\nRest in peace, little angel \ud83d\udc94\ud83e\udd40",

I don't want anyone to get hurt, I don't want any bigger war happening I love my life, my family I'm just 19 years old, and I'm so scared and nothing I can think of gives me at least a bit of peace. I want to sleep, I can't, I'm nervous and shaking, and I have no idea what's coming. I hope so bad something happens and nothing escalates into something really bad",

Russia basically got canceled, and that is going to cripple their country, which leaves the massive possibility that they'll go trigger happy.",

I agree, my country, or just the US shouldn\u2019t interfere too much. We may not be allies with Russia, but I would rather stay on Putin\u2019s good side rather than risk our lives for one country. Maybe China would interfere eventually, than North Korea, South Korea, Japan, Germany, Mexico, Canada, Italy, England, and maybe other countries which would soon cause a World War III if we actually sent troops down there. I\u2019m not religious, neither am I christian or any of that stuff, but if I were you, I\u2019d just hope and pray that Ukraine gets out of this situation with less blood on the ground than there already is. I don\u2019t want to see innocent people die. I don\u2019t really like humanity, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care for it. The safety of humanity is something that I wish would stay unbroken, but with all this bullshit, it\u2019s almost impossible to live in safe, secure, and peaceful society. Although, this is just a small fragment in Earth\u2019s history, and maybe it will die down sometime and Ukraine and Russia can learn to accept their differences. I\u2019m sure Russia wants something better than this. The last thing we need is another Hitler or Joseph Stalin. If you read this, I hope you understand what I am trying to say.",

Their economy is roughly the size of Spain's.  And the Russian people are not interested in further personal suffering just so Putin can swing his dick around the world stage.      \n\n\nAnd this is where my worry comes in... Putin was stupid to attack...  There is a reasonable chance he could lose without the US or NATO putting a single boot on the ground.   Then what does he do?

But there are so many other things that do this but don\u2019t require war and death. No matter what job you do in the military and how far from the front lines, you are a part of it.\n\nYour still in elementary school, and have yet to discover so much. Im not being condescending, i grew up in a military family and have been where you are.  But as you see more of what our military has done but wont tell you, it might change how highly you regard it. \n\nIf your really into research, I really recommend the book \u2018a people\u2019s history of the united states\u2019 by howard zinn. It goes in depth on the history of America our government and military would prefer we forget.\n\nIm not tryin to get you to hate America. I don\u2019t myself, just always want us to do better. But its good to know the real history  of anything you stand for.\n\nI wish you a good and safe life, far from any real conflict.",

Came back got married has two kids\u2026 currently has at best 5 years left thanks to the effects of the burn pits he was exposed to. A painfull and inglorious way to go. And these lives lost or ruined all for a cause that, upon looking back, was a lie.\n\nIts all great when there is no war. But war is hell for everyone involved.  The only ones that don\u2019t experience some kind of hell are the politicians and businesses that profit from war.  The military industrial complex is the only winner, and it has a lot invested in encouraging kids to sign away their lives.\n\nYou may have done your research.

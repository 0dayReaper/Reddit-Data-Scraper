    "postText": "just wanted to see if anyone had gone through something like this before or if there is anything i can do to make it better? so my girlfriend and i (both 21) started dating a little less than a year ago, but we've been very close friends for a few years. when we first became friends her parents never liked me for whatever reason (it's changed many times- like the first time it was because i talked too much at a family/friends halloween party to her extended family, then they didn't like how much \"time\" i spent with her little brother (took him to play basketball like twice), then it was because i was bisexual (even though they have always been lgbt supportive, then they didn't like that i introduced her to some of -our now- mutual friends, etc). they also think that i somehow \"tricked\" or \"seduced\" her into dating me (no clue how i would do that??)and that it was my plan to do that since we met. now they think that i am isolating her, she is dependent on me, and all her \"issues\" are now coming up because i keep talking to her about them. she has been diagnosed with ocd since she was nine but was never treated or went to therapy for it. her parents don't like that i am \"acting\" like her therapist (i am a third year student studying psychology). and all this other little stuff too. its been more than two years and sometimes i feel like its getting better, like when we go to dinner at their house or other family functions or events and we have nice, enjoyable conversations, then a few days later they're yelling at my girlfriend about all the things she's doing wrong (usually its my fault). recently, she brought up seeing a new therapist because we have been talking about her ocd and how she has always wished it would go away or get better and how much she feels it really has been affecting her life and she is just now realizing that. i mentioned going to see someone for it- her parents deny that her ocd is \"bad enough\" to even go see someone and her dad keeps saying she is making it up for drama and just to have something to talk about. i feel like i have done everything in my power to achieve her parents approval but it doesn't seem to stick. her mom and i get along fairly well and i think she is starting to like me more, but her dad always pulls it back. i feel i have been a great a partner, supportive and caring and i have always tried my best to interact with her family and connect with them. i just feel so defeated. this is the girl that i want to marry and its something that her and i have been talking about for a while but i dont know how to win her parents over or if i even can. i understand where they're coming from, they are very, very protective, but i just dont know what else to do.",

            "comment": "idk it kinda sounds like you\u2019re doing what they should\u2019ve done when she was a child and they feel some type of way about that. guilt maybe? it also sounds like they deny the existence of her problems which is something i\u2019ve seen fairly commonly with a lot of parents because they don\u2019t want to accept the fact that their child isn\u2019t \u2018normal\u2019 so they are getting upset that you\u2019re bringing it to the forefront as opposed to keeping it hidden away. how does your girlfriend feel about them not liking you? does it affect the relationship between you two? \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing anything wrong, at least based off this post. In my experience, parents are fickle a lot of the time, they\u2019re not always going to like you whether that reasoning is subjective or objective. Subjective being what I mentioned earlier with you bringing awareness to your girlfriends issues, objective just generally being a bad partner. If you\u2019re treating her well and they still don\u2019t like you you\u2019re just gonna have to accept that fact. If you continue making their daughter happy, they\u2019ll see that and if you\u2019re not doing anything to actively bring harm to their daughter then eventually they\u2019ll come around. For now, it really depends on how close her relationship is with her parents, if their approval means everything to her and you two can\u2019t get past this barrier together you may have to consider calling it quits, as shitty as that is. I hope that isn\u2019t the case, but i\u2019m rooting for you regardless. Best of luck.",

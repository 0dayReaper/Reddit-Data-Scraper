    "postText": "I hate how I\u2019ve changed as a person. I used to love meeting new people\u2026now I don\u2019t really even care. Before I would be able to have and hold conversations with people I just meant, usually because I would have an interest in meeting and getting to know the person. \n\nNow\u2026now I don\u2019t really care to. I remember how even though I was shy and usually kept to myself I wanted to try to make friends. So I did. I tried, as scary as it was for me I tried and even when I failed I still tried and enjoyed it. \n\nThe love I had to meet people is gone now. I used to be the friend that would check up on and maintain friends. One of my older friends even told me, \u201cYou really keep in touch with people\u201d. Now I don\u2019t even do that anymore. Haven\u2019t heard from those friends since. This is don\u2019t really care about much of anything, even the things I used to enjoy. It sucks. \n\nIm still me in other ways, but this\u2026this bothers me.",

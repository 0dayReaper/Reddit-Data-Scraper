    "postText": "She was shot in the head by a jilted ex. My sister is gone forever, because some guy didn\u2019t know how to hear \u201cno\u201d and had a gun in his possession. My nephew is now motherless, because a guy with a known history of drug use was able to buy a 45. My mom is having to bury her 19 year old daughter. \n\nNow my family is just another statistic.\n\nEditing to add: I am reading every comment and I do appreciate all of the kindness and compassion from everyone. I\u2019m getting overwhelmed trying to reply to everyone, but please know that I see your comments and I am grateful.",

The ones that occasionally turn up in gun shops only fire flares or 12 gauge, which are unregulated by the ATF.",

If you think it is, you have never actually tried to buy a gun, or when you did, you got an OK in a couple of minutes, because you didnt have any flags.\n\nCongrats if the second scenario is the case, you are one of the 10% of gun owners without a criminal history, who havent run into some kind of moronic foul up caused by the shoddy ATF system known as NICS. The one that was supposed to be updated in 2012, and again in 2014, but Obama said 'nah we dont need to update the 20 year old systems to make the process actually work'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthere is no gun show loophole. Does. Not. Exist. You buy a gun from a legal firearms dealer, and you have to do a back ground check.\n\nPrivate/personal sales, are largely between family, and they have the risk of you know, having a murder weapon come back on you, if you sell it to the wrong person. Most people who sell a firearm privately, either sell to family, or pay the 45-60$ for an FFL to run a back ground. Some FFLs do it for free.\n\nOf the 1% of firearms used in non-gang related shooting deaths, less than 2% were purchased legally. Around 12 legally purchased firearms a year, are used in a crime by the person who bought it. And of those, 90% will be a case of self defense that was wrongfully charged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Contrast, 750k women a year, use a firearm to defend themselves from an abusive spouse or ex spouse.\n\n750k women, who survive another year, because they could have access to a firearm.\n\nGiven that 92% of domestic violence victims receive a diagnosis or PTSD or Depression because of the DV, and the suggestion you make of 'being cleared by a doctor', your idea would disarm DV victims, while doing jack to disarm the criminals who would kill them.",

The realization of not being able to do things with her anymore is so painful, like something is suddenly ripped from deep inside you. I'm so sorry you have to go through this.\n\nEven if it feels so distant now, I can promise you that in the future it will get better. Instead of feeling broken whenever you think of her, you will create an incredibly strong positive, loving and proud feeling instead. It will take long to get there, as you don't want any of this because you want her back, but you can do this!\n\nHugs to you and your family!\n\nStay strong",

Many people claim that it's their right to own fire arms to defend themselves and while they're not wrong because the laws allow it, those laws should be revised imo. Most occurrences involving guns are from people killing their spouses, their neighbors or anyone else they have a heated disagreement with...not to mention school shootings. Matters that could be settled with dialog, are many times done so with bullets. Very few are the cases where a gun is effectively used to defend one's home from a burglar, for instance.

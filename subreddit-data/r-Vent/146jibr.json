    "postText": "We just got done watching a movie on Peacock and my mom was browsing the different categories and she came across \"Amplifying LGBTQIA Voices\" and immediately flew off the rails, saying things like \"I don't wanna see this shit!\" and \"why do they have to shove all this shit down my throat!\". \n\nI then brought up the fact that that content is completely optional to watch and that no one is prying her eyes open and making her watch it like it's A Clockwork Orange. Then she got on a rant about how school teachers are telling kids they can choose their gender or whatever and how puberty blockers are being forced on children. \n\nI told her \"none of that's true. It's bullshit made up Fox News, and the only people that can give puberty blockers are pediatric endocrinologists and theyd be fired for forcing the wrong medicine on someone. Also that puberty blockers are not dangerous and that puberty resumes when taken off of them.\"\n\nI told her how I know all this, but she didn't care. She just wants to stay in her safe conservative little bubble and it infuriates me.",

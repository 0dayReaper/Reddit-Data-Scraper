    "postText": "My boyfriend and I are different races, I never thought much about it until I met his family. His mother is an immigrant from a country with significantly different beauty standards than the US, and she made it clear that in her country I would not be considered beautiful. His grandmother said that people in her home country would assume I'm pregnant if they saw me. They've said that I'm too tall and not slender enough, just stuff like that. It's always sort of bothered me, especially when his family brings up how they would've liked him to be with someone of their race. Today, out of nowhere, he said \"I wonder what you would look like if you were *his race*\", and I'm pretty sure he did mean it in a negative way, but idk, I'm still a little upset about it",

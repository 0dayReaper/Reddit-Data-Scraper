I want to be there for them and help them get better bc a lot of their mistakes are caused by mental health issues, but like, I also feel like I have to be real with them and tell them my honest opinion, which is that they need to face the consequences of their actions if they come, or if they keep tryna justify their behaviour that is both self-destructive and harmful to others (regardless of those other people may not be great themselves), I'm going to need to distance myself from them at least, and honestly just be open about their behaviour with other people. \n\nWhat confuses me most of all is that a lot of the shit has been happening between different people in our friend group, and my friends always have different versions of each story and whose to blame and what actually happened. Both parties seem to be in the wrong each time, but based on what I'm told, each story portrays each person as varying degrees of bad. \n\nI'm not sure what to do, or how to feel as a friend, and I don't understand why it's constantly me who they tell instead if confronting each other. \n\nI'm sorry this is so vague and confusing, but there's so many things bothering me and I don't know where to start, but I've needed to say something to someone for a long time",

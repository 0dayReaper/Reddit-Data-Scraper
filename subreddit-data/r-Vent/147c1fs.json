    "postText": "I should be happy, everything is going good. I got meds for my MDD, I'm in treatment for my PTSD and anxiety, my OCD is under control, and I'm gonna go on testosterone soon. Everything is good, I should be happy. But I'm not, I feel so empty, i feel like everything is going wrong. I'm just waiting for my mom to relapse or for me to relapse or for somthing else horrible to happen. I should be happy, but I just want to sleep all day. I'm so tired and I'm so angry and nothing is helping. The meds arent working, the therapy isnt working, the dumbass \"coping skills\" arent working. The only thing that makes me feel remotely happy is weed, or cigarettes, or SH. And those things dont even make me actually happy, they just make me forget everything for a moment. But that's not enough, I cant keep doing this, I just want to die. I should be able to suck this up.  Theres other people who have it worse than me and they arent crying about it on fucking reddit like a loser. I should be ok but I'm not, and I dont understand why im not. Anyways that was fucking emo as shit and I'm so sorry for anyone who had to hear a dumb teenager vent about jackshit.",

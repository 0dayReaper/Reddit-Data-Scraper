    "postText": "After my last friendship break up it feels like I\u2019m stuck, it\u2019s like I don\u2019t have a best friend anymore. \nI still have friends and they\u2019re amazing, but I don\u2019t have one friend that is very close to me, it feels like they\u2019re all are close to me equally, and they\u2019re not even that close. It feels like my friendship with everyone is on a surface level. \n\nI\u2019m not complaining, I like it this way. Tbh, I felt a lot of pressure when my friends were my best friends. If I told one best friend about something, the other best friend would get mad because I didn\u2019t tell her. \nI\u2019m a person who doesn\u2019t tell anyone about somethings, only certain ppl. And sometimes I felt obligated to tell someone about something that I don\u2019t feel comfortable telling them about but I had to because they were my best friend, how could not tell them? But now I feel kind of free. I\u2019m trying to not get attached to anyone and not rely on someone for my happiness. \nGetting attached to someone is the worst, because when you\u2019re not with them anymore it would hurt a lot and it\u2019ll take u a long time to get over them and stop thinking about them, so in order for this to not happen again, I decided to make all my friendships on a surface level. \n\nI realized that the ppl that I should be close to are my family. My sisters and cousins are the best friends that I could ever have. I grew up with them, we did everything together, we have a lot of happy memories together. And no matter how many times we argue, we always get back together. I decided to focus on my family rather than tire myself trying to please ppl who probably aren\u2019t gonna be with me for the rest of my life.\n\nPS: I might have made it sound like my friends are bad friends, they\u2019re actually really good friends lol.",

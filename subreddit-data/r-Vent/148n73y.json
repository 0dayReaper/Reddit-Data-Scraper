    "postText": "I started making stained glass art even before this my whole life I've been a creative person drawing crafting sewing etc etc, but recently stained glass has consumed my creative space and I am so happy finally being able to do this. But out of every single friend person or mutual only 1 person actively supports me reposting my stuff and saying nice things and telling me they're proud of me which I am over the moon about and I love all of my friends obviously. Besides the 1 friend nobody else has done much of anything to support me besides the occasional \"oh thats cool\", but they're so quick to repost and comment on OTHER people's art and it really sucks because I'm an artist too and your friend so why not show support? A few of my friends have graduated from art school and they repost all their art friends stuff and say nice thing and beam with support, but when I comes to my glass all I get is a half hearted comment or \"you need to make this\" or \"are you sure those are going to sell?\" They really don't get how much it hurts my feelings because I don't get it, is it because I didn't go to art school and so my art compared to graduates isn't worthy of being appreciated? I get much more heartfelt genuine compliments from random people I've never met before more than my friends and I don't get why, I'm not asking to be showered in praise I just want some support for my art from the people I love, my aunt and uncle don't seem to care either. This doesn't change how I feel about my friends because I love them to death but I just want their support and I'd feel stupid and like I'm fishing for compliments if I ask, I think the worst thing was when I was talking about a new collection I'm planning on making and my friend said \"are you sure those are gonna sell?\" Like I don't give a shit if they sell or not I want to make them and have fun why can't you just say something nice and this friends has done and keeps doing this shit where I'll talk about what I'm making or planning and they'll say \"make this\" or \"you should make this\" or \"that isn't going to sell\" like can you please just say something nice I just needed to vent this somewhere because thinking about it just makes me sad. I do have support from the 1 friend and a few other art friends I've made along the way and I appreciate it to no end but I want the people closest to me in my life to also be supportive and it just makes me feel upset.",

Wherever I go, any new circles I build or try to fit in, everyone is so addicted to these mindless vibrations of auto tune music. Am I the only one that feels this way? Some modern pop/trap music have good lyrics once in a while in them, but the auto tuned vocals completely ruin the appeal of it. I'm not against auto-tune/pitch correction tech, I feel it's an amazing tool to polish your vocals, but to use it completely in order to add tune to your vocals, which \"were never there\", sounds so irritating and cringe. I love how Post Malone uses auto tune to further enhance his sound (which at a very base without auto tune is also melodic). But every other modern artist in the pop scene uses auto tune to add melody to something that never had it in the beginning. The end result just sounds so fake and bland, with 0 emotional value. We make music for emotional value isn't it?  By modern pop artists I mean folks like Swae Lee, Lil Uzi Vertz, basically every song on the new \"Into the new spider verse\" movie. That's my reference point. The music tracks on the first movie were comparatively better. I'm just sick of the auto tune vocal effect.",

Are you THREATENING A WOMAN?\" trying to get all loud, so I'm like I'm not getting involved I do not wanna end up in jail after knocking some heffer out. \n\nI stay inside call cops, the two white female officers show up as stated before, talking to the lady outside first, then come to my door knock on my door \n\n\"What seems to be the problem here, I hear you're threatening people?\" \n\nI explain I called them, why I called them due to the thief woman they just spoke to before me, and show them my mail parcel in the mud. \n\nTo which they respond \"its not an issue that we spoke to her first sir, were getting the full story\" \n\nTo which I respond \"so the full story starts off with accusing me of threatening people?\" \n\nThe two female officers lol they then start going full rambo:\n\n\"just keep your hands by your side sir, is anyone else in the house sir? You been drinking? any drugs today, no weapons anything we gotta worry about?\" \n\nMe: \"yeah I called you guys and have a loaded RPG on the coffee table\" \n\n(this was the moment I knew I fucked up, like unless you're Chris rock, fucking Dave chappelle, like unless u have a white guy first name and make people laugh, you can't be joking like that) \n\n\"how about you step outside and talk to us sir\"\n\nAfter asking why, and being told \"it's for everyone's safety and to \"talk\" \n\nI step outside to a SUV pulling up with 2 additional male cops, who get out full like swat like anything you could purchase to look \"cooler\" as a cop these guys purchased, and just stand with hand near holsters to show I suppose just in case \"this escalates\" \n\nAt this point I'm looking around at all these clowns, the person who stole from me, and officers slowly approaching telling me to calm down. \n\nI couldn't help it, I just blurted out: \"Do you want me to lay down with my neck exposed so you can kneel on it? Is that what you fucks want? If I'm not under arrest I'm going back inside, as I don't want someone accidentally murdering me today.\"\n\nThey continued talking some bs about just wanting to talk, and I just went inside and locked the door. \n\nand that Reddit, is why black people, don't call the cops. \n\nReason #6748836372.",

To operate a heavy-duty truck in Florida, you have to display a roughly 2\u201d x 3\u201d tax sticker on the side of the truck. It expires at midnight of the new year, but IFTA never ever mails out the new ones until late January. The IFTA agreement requires member jurisdictions to observe a 2-month grace period before writing tickets to drivers in trucks with expired stickers. The grace period is also noted on the fuel tax permit that goes in the truck\u2019s permit book. I think you can see where this is going.\n\nFeb 4 one of my drivers was ticketed by FHP for an expired IFTA sticker. We had to pay the fine to contest it, which we did and won. I just got the refund check in the mail last week.",

The thing that they all have in common is police doing a shitty job. The biases that the officers go in to a situation with may not be the same in every situation but a lot of times people are just treated poorly because that's the way things are done. On the other hand those same people that I know also have 'not bad' interactions with the police as well.\n\nAs a black person I can tell you I personally have had more good interactions than bad. \n\nIt also depends on where you live but ain't nobody happy when you see those lights go up behind you.\n\nEdit: Here's an example of a good interaction I had with a county sheriff. The car in front of me was driving slower than I would have liked, so I moved into the opposing traffic lane while it was a dotted line meaning that I'm allowed to pass. As I was passing him it turned to double solid meaning it is illegal to pass but I committed and finished the job cutting him off in the process. Obviously I didn't realize he was a cop at the time but that became clear when he pulled me over. In the end he let me off and told me to be more careful next time.",

If you saw a woman running away from a guy chasing her, your instinct is likely to defend the woman. Only to later find out that she just stole from the guy.\n\nIts okay to be mad, thats your right and this situation justifies it. However, it also seems like theres a confirmation bias here.\n\nyou already expected a negative interaction and your reactions/responses escalated the situation, which you admit happened.\n\nWhen I caught a guy stealing from me, I saw him, yelled at him, and he stopped and walked away. I didnt threaten him and at the time I also made the decision not to chase him down or call the police, since the act stopped already. thats just me though.",

The last time I did was over a meth dump in the woods by my best friend\u2019s house. She has a 7 year old daughter who plays over there, she was about 5 at the time. They would hike on the trails and stuff. We go over there one day and find that someone dumped a huge pile of meth refuse smack dab on the trail. I know that shit is toxic, I go home and call the police. They ask me for my number in case they have trouble finding it. About an hour later my phone rings, I pick it up \u201csir, the officer on scene is having trouble finding what you were talking about, could you please go back and show them.\u201d I thought, absolutely! I get back to the scene and start walking towards the cop when him and his female partner start acting aggressive as hell. I immediately started thinking something was up.\n\nI get about 10 feet from them when he demands my ID, of course I hand it to him. Then he proceeds to call my information in like he had just caught me breaking the law. Asks me to show him where this meth refuse pile is. He never even looked for it. We start walking towards the woods and he starts questioning me about it. It\u2019s then I catch on and realize he\u2019s accusing me of dumping this shit and then calling the police on myself and then driving all the way back across town to show him where it\u2019s at. \n\nHere are just a few of the ignorant things he said to me during that conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you would be in the woods.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you even saw the pile of trash.\u201d \u201cHow do you know what this stuff even is.\u201d \n\nIt was a 10x10 mountain of trash in the dead center of the trail. I explained to him that not only did I take a class on meth because I worked in a pharmacy, the shit is all over the TV and news on my area because it\u2019s so bad.\n\nKeep in mind I have no criminal record, I\u2019ve had 1 speeding ticket in almost 40 years. But he STILL accused me of planning all this and calling the police on myself.\n\nSo I am honestly curious, when does one decide that the police are doing something because of their skin color? How do you differentiate between racism and sexism? Because both cops I dealt with were white, a man and a woman. I\u2019m a white male and they treated me like some kind of psycho meth dealer for calling them.",

They called in extra officers to harm him or make sure he didn't retaliate.  They also didn't even listen to his side of the story.

I'm not for violence but if I catch someone doing shit like she did I'd sure as hell be dropping a comment or two as I call the cops too. \n\nHe threw a racially motivated comment at a cop? Not sure where you're from but cop on black violence has been a highly publicized issue for a long time. Yeah, he maybe shouldn't have joked about the RPG but he never made a threatening statement toward the cops. That one has nothing to do with race. In this day and age, I'd be looked at and talked to if I made a comment like that as well. \n\nHe's saying that, even though he was the victim in this circumstance, he was solely treated as the aggressor. What was he supposed to do? Let the Karen do as she wished, with no repercussions? That's what led her to feel like she can do whatever she wants, because nobody called her out before. \n\nThink before you speak - as a wise man once said, 'tis better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to open ones mouth and remove all doubt.",

Although probably not the best way to look like you're innocent. \n\nThen I looked at the law and found the laws are fucked. Being a snide to the cops aside, the assault threat being illegal for people commiting a federal crime on your property and stealing your own stuff is illegal? I get maybe actually doing it maybe but jeez. Under normal circumstances that law makes sense I guess. I mean op was overreacting a little bit with it but I digress. Considering the cops were already pissed, and he technically threatened violence, I'm sure they took care of what was their responsibility (assault threats and figuring out what was we wrong) and leaving the mail to the USPS. \n\nThere were definitely flaws in both sides to the situation. Being a smartass is a one way trip to the cops' bad side. But at the same time, they could've put 2 and 2 together and sort this out properly. I doubt it had anything to do with race, just the aggression and not taking the situation seriously. And the cops were likely already pissed that he was being a smartass and decided to stick to the good ol rules are rules, because according to the law, he technically was in the wrong in terms police as far as the police encounterment goes.

However, the minute you yelled and said you\u2019d \u201cknock\u201d her head off you created yet another problem. It\u2019s fine to be angry and pissed with her, but the moment that statement was made and she felt you were serious she had an \u201cout.\u201d You may have called the police about her stealing mail, but when they showed up they saw a woman crying and when they spoke to her it was mentioned you threatened her. \n\nAt that point they have two situations they need to solve and bring resolution to. Even if you wouldn\u2019t have really done it, the fact that you again said you\u2019d knock her oof was a threat. They needed to first calm that situation down, they can focus on the mail issues next it\u2019s not an immediate threat. (They could have even had her sit in the car until they finished speaking to you). Responding to them about the gun sitting on the table was unnecessary, that just brought more attention on you and made the mail situation irrelevant because in their mind you threatened to attack someone and then you said (even if you didn\u2019t have one) that you had a gun. \n\nAfter the gun statement I can see them asking you to step outside, the extra cops were probably a bit much if you didn\u2019t put an actual fight. I wouldn\u2019t have used the knee on neck issue, I get you were frustrated but it wasn\u2019t needed. \n\nAll in all the cops could have done a better job, one could have spoken to you and one could have spoken to her. However, telling someone you\u2019d attack them and then replying yes I have a gun out on the table doesn\u2019t help the situation. Like I said all parties fucked up to a degree, and all of this was easily avoidable.",

But let me ask you something, who is more threatening in this scenario? 4 strapped cops with hands near their holsters, a woman who is committing a crime, or the single, unarmed, \u201cbig tall scary\u201d black guy? \n\nYour skewed perception on who is the \u201creal\u201d threat is mind-boggling. The woman, who HAS ACTUALLY COMMITTED A CRIME, is more threatening than the man who called the cops. That is the type of dangerous stereotype that leads people to distrust. I\u2019m a touch over 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. Why the fuck should I be scared to call the cops because I might be a bigger threat than the perpetrator? Fuck that. \n\nProve to me that there have been more dangerous encounters between cops and tall dudes versus women. Show me the receipts.",

That alone proves that men have a tendency to act more violent. So when you arrive as a cop on a scene like this and have a woman that is accused of stealing a letter or a parcel and have on the other side a tall man that has already threaten to use force who would you be more aware of? Remember many more violent crimes committed by men and a situation that seems to escalate. Btw the dude himself put in some effort to make that situation escalate by the jokes. Also he mentioned the knee and there was no sign of the cops trying to arrest him. No guns were drawn he was not forced to lay down. There was no sign at all the cops are snapping any moment to use force. So in that situation it is just dumb to provoke the cops. What is more likely to make the situation go bad? Keep your cool and act according to the situation by staying calm talk what happened and NOT pull any jokes like 'i got an RPG on my table'? Or accusing them of being trigger happy and violent murderers like OP did? If you really want to say that his behaviour was not escalating the whole situation and you would act the same way when you have an encounter with the police i can only wish you good luck to have cops with a clear and good understanding about police ethics in what is okay and what not.",

Try to see the dangers cops are facing in their job. Cops tend to meet the scum of mankind in their job hours. Drug dealers, gang bangers, rapists, robbers and so on. Often there will be situations where a gun is involved even in situations that seem to appear harmless. Now when coming to a call you always have to be aware of that danger and hence you do not have the luxury of just seeing a joke, no matter what tone, as you can never say if you have a mentally ill person in front of you. \n\n3. so you want to say that all cops join the police force to someday have the chance to shoot somebody? Thatis the same mindset racist have by saying all blacks or all mexicans are 'xyz'. Most cops join the force as they feel the need to make their respective communities safer and not more dangerous. Also if you want to shoot people it is far more easy to join the military and go abroad. There you can shoot as many peiple you want and will not face any problems for doing that.",

            "comment": "Omg this gets me HEATED. \nI remember this one time my mom, uncle, brother and I (he was about 10 and I was 11) were driving around in our Nissan mini van. My mom was learning how to drive and being instructed by my uncle. She didn't have a license. My uncle's dumbass tells my mom to go over a boulder and enter a McDonald's parking lot. She at first refused but then went ahead. A cop sees that and stops us in the middle of the crowded parking lot, like his car and ours are over 8 parking spots. \n\nThe Hispanic cop (we're Hispanic too) comes out and gets all aggressive with my mom. She's 4'1\", 50 years old. The cop is about 30 probably. He spots my uncle and immediately assumes our car is a threat? Bc he calls back up which is odd bc he clearly saw my brother and I sitting in the back too. He then proceeds to make my mom step out, then shoves her onto his hood, like she's bending over his car, while he fucking handcuffs her hands to her back. \n\nAt this point back up arrived and the backup dude looked at the first cop like ??? At some point I'm so sure the back up cop told him to relax. My brother is crying now and I'm worried and kind of in shock. The first cop then puts my mom in his car and takes her to the station. \n\nYesterday I saw a cop car behind a white car. The white car went over the boulder (like my mom did), and guess what? The police car just kept driving. Literally everyday since they arrested my mom I've seen countless people drive over and not one has been even reprimanded. \n\nOh yeah, after paying her bail we had to go to court due to the cop arresting her. He was supposed to show up to trial too. Guess what? He didn't. Shocker.\n\nI wish I could slash his tires along with those asshole \"cops\" you mentioned. I don't even want to call them cops bc an associates degree and they immediately think they're God or something",

    "postText": "I realized recently that almost every single one of my friends only has a full conversation with me if it\u2019s about them. It\u2019s been weeks since I\u2019ve told someone about my day, or talked to someone about Somethjng cool that\u2019s happened and gotten more than a one word reply from it. I tried telling them about something cool that happened today and I got three responses. One of them was \u201coooo\u201d the other was \u201chuh,\u201d And another was just me being called \u201ccringe.\u201d Other than that, I was ignored with no response until they needed Something, or had something cool in THEIR life that they wanted to tell me.\nAnd it\u2019s been like that for weeks. All I want to do is talk to someone about my day, or even talk about something cool that happened. Is that too much to ask? I\u2019m about to fall asleep, because I\u2019m so over and done with this. I\u2019m so tired physically, mentally, and the only thing I can do anymore is sleep.",

Thankfully he\u2019s not friends with them anymore lmao but THATS cringy.",

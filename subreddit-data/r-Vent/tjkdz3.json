    "postText": "I know Im going to get jumped on down voted for this but I am upset/pissed/insert word of choice here and I need to vent.\n\nIm a human trafficing survivor. I have survived things as a child that made grown adults vomit when they heard my story. Im not here to tell my story though Im here to bitch.\n\nRape is not a kink. Rape is not a fantasy. People that support this specific kink, write these kind of stories or perform these horrendous things for ENTERTAINMENT should be subjected to a psychological exam. There is something SERIOUSLY wrong with you if violating another human in the most brutal way gets you off. \n\nNow Im not talking about CNC or \"consensual nonconsent\" where its clearly been negotiated that its just pretend, just a play acting and the person having things done still has dominion over their body but has temporarily given it up.\n\nIm talking things like \"Rape\" audios, where the writer gives an explicit step by step and the victim is clearly a crime victim. Im talking movies and tv shows that use this horrendous form of abuse as a plot point. \n\nWhat makes it worse is I cant complain or say anything to combat the hundred plus reactions of \"this was amazing\" or \"soooo hot\" or Im kink shaming. But thats my whole point...it shouldnt BE a kink! Why as a society has this become acceptable, even \ud83e\udd22 encouraged?? I have to carefully screen reviews on things I watch or read or ask friends to avoid the dunked in ice water panic that I get when confronted of reminders of my trauma. Why is it so damn mainstream and accepted?? We teach consent, use the #yesallmen #metoo but then turn a blind eye or cheer it on when its in entertainment form. The cognitive dissonance is maddening. \n\n\nI dislike humanity severely some days. In my not so humble opinion all of that sort of \"entertainment\" should be behind locks and age verification and not just out in general media. If you want that deviance you should have to jump through hoops and search for it, not me and other survivors forced to walk like its a field of landmines just to avoid it.\n\nAnyways.. let the down votes begin.",

Rape isn't a kink. \n\nThere's a difference in writing a book or making a movie about surviving rape and the trauma and problems that come with it to show the seriousness of the issue and actually encouraging the rape and making it seem sexy and hot and like it's nothing more than a kink.\n\nAwareness is important. Romanticising and making a horriffic crime something sexual and kinky is downright monstrous.\n\nIt is insensitive and quite honestly, disgusting and horrifying that people do that sort of shit; both commit the crimes and romanticise rape.\n\nI'm sorry you had to go through all of that just to find people romanticising your living nightmares. It's terrible for you and other survivors. \n\nI hope you're doing better now btw. If you ever need to talk, my DMs are open. :D",

One of those isn\u2019t a rapekink thankfully. Whenever someone even breaches my consent at least a tiny bit, it sends me into a panic attack.\n\nI want to add that people should also be careful to not romanticise rape since it\u2019s still a dreadful crime to experience. I feel like some people somewhat romanticise the experience when it\u2019s honestly the thing that tore me apart.",

She told a group of mutual friends who all decided it was ok to think it was hot because they found a way to incorporate my pain into their rape/CNC/DDLG/CGL kinks (it was ***not*** my father who did it, btw.)

Found out later she wanted to rape roleplay. And I had to ask her where her kink stemmed from, found out it she was raped by her uncle when she was 10 huge red flag! But I couldn\u2019t walk away b/c it could\u2019ve been a child on the other line that needed help but they just stopped replying when I inquired if she could confirm her age for me. \n\nThat would be completely different from someone willingly giving up control, and we designing a scenario for her that she was comfortable with that would fulfill her fantasies. \n\nBeing actually taken against your will is not the same thing and extremely scary. Sex in general is a mental thing for women, it\u2019s a fine line between pleasure and unwanted prodding and pain. That\u2019s why rape cases are so hard to discern in the first place especially when both parties are drunk. It\u2019s unfortunate that we can\u2019t figure out a way to better deal with them, idk the solution. But I feel for every woman that has been raped or been in a sexual encounter they don\u2019t want to be in. I don\u2019t understand the ones where they change their minds mid way, as a guy I\u2019m either hard or I\u2019m not and if I get turned off I just pull out. As a girl it\u2019s not that simple since the mind is fickle and focus and letting go are abstract ideas. \n\nBut I digress, I don\u2019t think most ppl who watch csi or movies with rape scenes in them think they are hot tbh, I think they are intrigued by the rest of the character development and the only way to empathize or sympathize is write and talk about it in society or else you will get ppl who simply can\u2019t begin to understand and you will never have support until it happens to them.

And I don\u2019t want to work with someone covered in poop, or pee, or anything like that. \n\nAnd yes, I definitely would look at someone who had rape fantasies differently. They are somewhat normal, according to some psychological journals, many if not most of us have had them at some point in our lives, guess what? It\u2019s ok to be ashamed of that, especially if it\u2019s something they are fixated on. Shame is a good indicator that something you did was wrong and you should be ashamed about it.\n\nNot everything is ok. We shouldn\u2019t be continuously pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable behavior, and what isn\u2019t. \n\nImagine yourself discovering that a coworker is addicted to child pornography, you confront that person and threaten with legal action, then he scoffs at you, and calls you a \u201ckink shamer\u201d .

Those should be in a dedicated place that is all that is there. Easier to avoid for yhose that dont suppot it.\nThe 2nd is the audio that triggered my panic attack is NOT cnc. In the slightest. And the author knew that too because he wrote a loooong disclaimer about how he doesnt condone it, its fantasy etc etc. The audio is a make-believe fantasy about how to kidnap and rape someone at a presentation. The victim is clearly a victim. Its cruel, its brutal and it romanticizes one of the most heinous acts, my nightmares. So yes Im shaming. Im shaming the author, Im shaming the supporters, esp the ones that haaaad to confess how they got off to it. To RAPE. That is 100% not okay. \n\nIm not sorry if I hurt feelings. Im not sorry if people feel shame. Stop eroticizing my and thousands of other females...girls, women, even men and boys trauma and then there is nothing to be ashamed about. \n\nI even concede on CNC, because its clearly 100% negotiated that some words lose their power but others gain it. Even CNC has safe words. Ways to stop it if it gets \"too much\". So the \"victim\" still has their power.\n\nReal rape is powerless. Utterly total complete ripping away of power. Because thats what THEY get off on. Taking that power. So while CNC stops if safewords are uttered there is NOTHING you can do to stop it for real. The only power I had to survive was to turn inwards, shut off and shut out the outside world. So excuse me if Im more than a little upset that my experience\nHas\nBeen\nEROTICIZED. FANTASIZED. TURNED INTO A ROMANTIC TROPE. \n\nIm not sorry.",

I don't think there's anything wrong with OP wanting no part of CNC but to call/agree that anyone who does it is a creep or some kind of predator is ignoring a plethora of evidence that says the contrary. \n\nI am a survivor of rape. I was raped for almost 6 years in an extremely violent situation that I barely made it out of alive. CNC has helped me heal in ways I never thought possible. \n\nI'm not saying OP is missing out or that they should try it. But don't talk about things you don't understand just because you have a commonality with it. I have autism but that doesn't mean I know everything about autism. There are plenty of professionals that could explain my disability better than I could. That doesn't mean I'm not autistic nor does it mean my voice doesn't have a place. It does. Just not everywhere and in everything. I would be an asshole if I was acting as an arbiter to anything autistic.\n\nThat's what OP is doing. Just because it's not their thing doesn't mean those who are into it are some depraved people. There's actually a lot information and even Bessel van Der Kolk speaks to how CNC has helped healed millions of rape survivors. \n\nAll in all, don't go telling people they're bad for liking something and then not expect people to call you out. This isn't a vent -- this is OP using this sub as a way to be a judgment twat. Being a rape survivor doesn't give you some pass to be an ass to people and judge them harshly like this. You can not be into something, that's fine. Degrading and putting down others isn't an opinion - it's a prejudice. OP *is* an asshole 100% for this.",

You can't just change what a word means and ignore all the facts that say it's not what you're calling it. I mean, seriously, it seems very obvious that you haven't taken the time to read the definition. So no, it's not a slur and how the fuck can it be ableist? OP isn't disabled. I'm fucking disabled and I don't see how in any concept that the comment was meant to be ableist.\n\n\nJust, fucking hell. You can't just insult people like that when you don't have one iota of evidence to stand on. You not liking a comment doesn't make it ableist or a slur and it's incredibly narcissistic and short-sighted to act like you have any authority to do so. \n\nI even took a few minutes to look at OP's profile. I already don't entirely believe what I read on Reddit. I mean, it is an anon platform so you can essentially say and claim whatever you want and people would be hard pressed to prove otherwise - unless you're particularly bad at acting. I honestly question the entire account and they seem very angry and a shit ton of angst. \n\nAnd you know what? It doesn't matter ultimately. It's still not okay to be a judgmental twat and use rape as some token to get out of being a condescending and insufferable asshole to people just because they don't like something. Well, it's a good thing no one's making them look. They can simply say \"not for me\" and walk away. Why the need to shit on other people when there's a plethora of research that has shown many successes with CNC play. Another thing, re-visiting trauma helps. It's been proven ad nauseum, so yes, it was necessary because if OP had taken any time before opening that hole in their face, they'd know they sound ignorant as hell. So if OP can't even be bothered to actually know what the fuck they're talking about, they should be embarrassed or shamed for saying what they did. That's how voicing opinions work.",

How many times have you heard a friend tell a rape joke, or watched them catcall or otherwise harass someone and said nothing? That is rape culture and what the #yesallmen means. Not that we mean literally every man is a rapist.\n\nIm sorry my example hurt your feelings. But its exceptionally telling that you made this a gender issue when I did not except by using a hashtag example.",

I was raped for almost 6 years in an extremely violent situation that I barely made it out of alive. CNC has helped me heal in ways I never thought possible. \n\nI'm not saying OP is missing out or that they should try it. But don't talk about things you don't understand just because you have a commonality with it. I have autism but that doesn't mean I know everything about autism. There are plenty of professionals that could explain my disability better than I could. That doesn't mean I'm not autistic nor does it mean my voice doesn't have a place. It does. Just not everywhere and in everything. I would be an asshole if I was acting as an arbiter to anything autistic.\n\nThat's what OP is doing. Just because it's not their thing doesn't mean those who are into it are some depraved people. There's actually a lot information and even Bessel van Der Kolk (if you don't even know who he is or read his books then you're just proving my point) speaks to how CNC has helped healed millions of rape survivors. Not every rape survivor heals the same way. Who the fuck are you to tell me how I heal? Fuck off and quit being a condescending twat.\n\nAll in all, don't go telling people they're bad for liking something and then not expect people to call you out. This isn't a vent -- this is OP using this sub as a way to be a judgment twat. Being a rape survivor doesn't give you some pass to be an ass to people and judge them harshly like this. You can not be into something, that's fine. Degrading and putting down others isn't an opinion - it's a prejudice. OP is a judgmental asshole and I find it disgusting that they would use their past as a way to justify their ignorance and clear misandry.",

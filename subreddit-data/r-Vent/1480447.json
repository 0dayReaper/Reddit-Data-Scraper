    "postText": "Some things that I can't understand have been happening recently. I'm going to try to explain this as well as I can, sorry for the long ass text.\n\nSo I'll start from the beginning. \n\n  \nAlmost 2 months ago I was playing a game with my friend (let's call him P). I was showing him a game he had never played before and was guiding him through the game. I sent a random chat message in the game chat (chat where the 100+ people that were playing in the server could talk in), the message I sent was something like \"I need some bitches\" idk something like that was just joking around.   \n\n\nSomeone replied, I don't remember what but it eventually led to them sending me their discord. It was a girl and she quickly stabilished that she was just joking in the game about the \"bitches\" stuff and I told her it was the same for me (Let's call her C). We kept playing for a few more hours and my friend P  was being pretty rude and toxic to her. She was telling me how she didn't enjoy the things that he was saying and I was telling that I didn't really know why he was saying that.\n\nAfter we stopped playing she told me that she'd be ok with playing with me again but not with him since she was really offended by the things he said. I told her that I was fine with that and that he wasn't even that interested in that game anyway.\n\nSo after that first day me and her talked every day and played almost every day too, it was going well I was happy about it and I was enjoying the fact that I was making a new friend.\n\nFast forward around 1 week and I was streaming, P and C showed up in the chat and eventually they added each other on discord cuz P wanted to talk about business (he really likes to talk about business and making money and all that even tho he hasn't really made any significant amount at all but anyway). And ever since that moment since they added each other and started talking that was when things started becoming weird between me and her.\n\nShe slowly started messaging me less often and I started to notice that only I would start conversations now. I eventually felt the need to tell her about how I've been feeling about P.\n\nA little side story about P so you guys get more context on how this guy is:\n\nP is a toxic, narcissistic, playboy guy who pretends to be all \"nice\" when talking to girls but only cares about f\\*\\*\\*ing them. A bit more than a year ago I stopped talking to him due to just getting tired of dealing with him. But in march I was feeling desperate after I broke up with my ex-gf in December and I couldn't find any new friends so I decided to start talking to him again. He didn't even ask why I stopped or anything and it was like nothing ever happened. I found it very strange but tried not to think too much about it and just move on.\n\nSo coming back to me wanting talking to C about P, I was telling her how I was regretting the fact that I decided to start talking to P again because of how he is and that I thought he'd be a bit better by now but he's even worse than before. She asked me why I thought badly of him and I told her some examples as well as the fact that he has cheated on his ex-gf multiple times, constantly talks about wanting to have 3 wives and has told me multiple times that he wouldn't mind f\\*\\*\\*\\*ing his friend's GFs and that he finds it hotter to try to f\\*\\*\\* a girl that's already taken because \"I only have to compete with 1 guy instead of everyone else\"... This guy is just fucked in the head and I already have so much I deal with myself that I just have no patience to deal with him.\n\nAlso after I talked with her about him she found out that he was actually the same guy as the one from the first time we talked that basically bullied her. She seemed shocked with that fact and that \"he's so nice when I talk to him tho\" and I told her that that's normal because he fakes his personality, I know that well because I've known him ever since we were 6 years old so basically my whole life. She seemed a bit skeptical but looked like she believed me.\n\nSo after that I was hoping there would've been some change but... nope.\n\nThey actually started talking more after that, I was finding this whole thing so confusing and still am.\n\nIt's been 4 days now since I decided to not message her and wait for her to be the one to start a conversation instead but guess what? Nothing. Not even 1 message.\n\nAnd it the past 4 days she's been playing with my friend every day.\n\nI just can't wrap my head around what is going on and I just desperatly need someone to fu\\*\\*\\*ing tell me what is going on because I sure don't. Here I was thinking I had finally found a good friend since me and her even vented to each other and she provided a good ear for me to vent and showed that she was understanding and told me that I could talk to her about stuff anytime and now she just completely ignores me?? Like wtf did I do? What happened? Did my friend say bad stuff about me? Seriously why is this happening to me.\n\nIf any of you want to know more context feel free to let me know and I'll do my best to explain further because I just feel like I'm going absolutely insane with this whole thing.\n\nAgain sorry for the big wall of text.",

I can bet that your friend P was probably saying some mean stuff about you. The fact that you said that you left him for a while and came back to him and he acted like nothing happened just shows that he couldn\u2019t care less about you (sorry that sounds aggressive) \nYou need to leave this dude and make new friends, he\u2019s only dragging you down. And if this girl doesn\u2019t reply to you, then leave her too and make new friends.",

But I guess I'm just scared about the possibility of not being able to find people, I know that sounds unrealistic, there's so many people out there right? But I can't help but think about that and also the constant fear that whoever I meet will just leave me too.   \nWhen I made the hard decision to stop talking to him a year ago I was able to do that since I was dating someone that really cared about me and made me feel loved. But now that I don't have that anymore it feels almost impossible to let go of his \"friendship\" even tho I dislike it.   \nIt's not that he's completely bad but he definitely has more bad than good, me and him do have our fun times and laugh and all but overall I do dislike him. Recently I did start finally working out (after not doing it for years) and it has definitely helped me distract myself a little bit from the whole thing.",

I know how hard it is to be attached to a toxic person, but you have to realize in the end he\u2019ll only end up hurting you. And don\u2019t worry about not finding any new friend, if you managed to make that girl talk to you then you can do that again with anyone else. You probably won\u2019t find someone right away but maybe try interacting with the people in your server and making jokes with them, then adding them after you\u2019ve had some conversations.",

I have been distancing myself a little bit from him as he has from me since he started playing with her so maybe I can eventually stop talking to him or at least rarely interact with him. As to her I just don't know, but I've been imagining if she does regret spending time with him I'll be so damn happy to tell her \"I told you so\" lol but oh well, just gotta keep dealing with this for now I guess and do my best to distract myself from it.",

He was definitely talking about you behind your back and manipulating the situation. Also stay away from him. Or at least don't just passively stand by when he degrades other people. \n\nHonestly just cut them both off. Completely disappear without saying a word.",

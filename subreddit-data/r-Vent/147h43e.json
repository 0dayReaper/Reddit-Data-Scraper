    "postText": "Perhaps I\u2019m too far broken to be put back together. Maybe I\u2019ve gotten to a point where I\u2019ve been dropped so many times and lost too many pieces to be seen as who I am. I figured it will get better and life will get easier cause that\u2019s what everyone says to me, but where is this better? Have any of you seen it? How can one believe in better when better is saying others have it worse or you can get through this by faking it. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m so tired and probably psychologically broken to a degree of needing to be committed. I want to move on and I\u2019ve let go of a lot. how does one keep letting go without letting the important pieces go as well.",

    "postText": "As the title says, I\u2019m trying to swallow the fact that I\u2019ll have surface level friends for all of my life. I feel hollow and maybe even a little bit jealous whenever I see people who have friends that they have a deep connection with, because /I/ want my friendships to be like that. \n\nI\u2019m currently in one big friend group, and in that group it has its own subunits, so to say. I always see the other subunit being open about their feelings to each other and wanting advice from them and them only. They seem like they could stay friends for a life time. While the subunit I\u2019m in feels so surface level; sure, one of them sees my thoughts and feelings but that\u2019s just because I usually rant on social media about it and that\u2019s how they can see it.\n\nBut whenever I ask them about what\u2019s wrong, they would never want to say it or just say that it\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s nothing bad about not being comfortable with sharing your emotions with your friends because I believe it takes a lot of time and reassurance for shit like that. I just want to be there for someone and here all their thoughts, emotions, what\u2019s going on in their life, how I can help them with what they\u2019re feeling.\n\nUltimately, I think I just want someone who I can be close with platonically. Close in a sense that they can tell me whatever they\u2019re thinking and not get judged for it, and they can do the same for me. \n\nTLDR : im ranting about my want to have deeper connections with my friends on my birthday.\n\n\n\nedit 1 : wow ISBAJS i didnt expect my word dump of a rant to be seen as something worth relating by strangers on the internet, but it /does/ make me feel better. i hope we can all find people who give back as much platonic (and romantic) love that we give to them. just some clarifications as well :\n\n- my friends (and friend group as a whole) arent assholes !! theyre funny and we listen to each other, it\u2019s just that the other subunit that i mentioned has a bond deeper than what i described for the friend group as a whole. \n\n- sometimes it feels like im intruding whenever i talk to someone from the other subunit (its just one specific person) although, i /am/ comfortable to make jokes with the other people in the subunit (just not to that one specific person)",

I hung around with some people, not friends. \n\nI'm 40, still no friends, just colleagues. \n\nFor ages I was super jealous of those who had friends and someone to talk to. I split with my ex a few months back and was the best thing I did. I had to learn to do things on my own such as going to gigs, movies, having a meal and going on a wee holiday alone. \n\nIt really made me see how I can do things without anyone. Makes you stronger. \n\nI also still have that need to connect with others and I'm sure it'll still happen when I'm ready. \n\nGet yourself out there. Enjoy life.",

I see the way you all trust each other and communicate about the things that matter. It\u2019s so refreshing, sometimes I crave deep, meaningful connections like the ones you have with each other.\u201d And then you could share something about yourself to open the doorway for connection \u201cI feel lonely sometimes. I\u2019ve been going through xyz and sometimes I fear that I won\u2019t have the meaningful connections to share these experiences with others\u201d and then see how they respond\u2026. Maybe even ask \u201chow did you guys build these deep bonds?\u201d \n\nI say plan a hangout with that other subgroup, just you and them, if there\u2019s too many of them then pick like 2 of them that you feel you can connect with and then find some type of long thing like a hike or a picnic or whatever else &amp; find a way to have long meaningful conversations with them\n\nI think getting close with a couple of them at a time would be better than with the whole group because if everyone is all together then they might focus more on their bond then making active attempts to uphold meaningful conversations. It gets harder with more people. 3 is a magic number so you and two others should be perfect. But maybe not two others who are so close that they\u2019ll talk to each other the whole time and exclude you",

    "postText": "All my mom does is put me down and she doesn\u2019t celebrate my wins and she doesn\u2019t celebrate my success, but she is extremely harsh on anytime I fail or otherwise screw up. \u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing except make my life hard\u201d is one of the last things she said to me before I moved out, and she is only saying this because she doesn\u2019t know how to communicate that me leaving is upsetting. She has admitted this. She goes on rant after rant about how awful I am, how excited she is that I\u2019m leaving, and all I say is that I\u2019m sorry she feels that way. Then, a few days go by or sometimes just hours, and she texts me that it\u2019s hard to see me grow up and leave. \n\nI\u2019m at a point in my life where I finally have a stable job, a stable and loving relationship, I\u2019m doing well in college and am on track to graduate when I planned to. She constantly tells me that I will fail, I won\u2019t be able to afford my rent and I will not succeed in life and when that happens, I shouldn\u2019t come crying to her. \n\nShe intentionally plants seeds of doubt in my mind. About my home, college, my relationship, how I am going to be reliant on her, it\u2019s like she wants me to be afraid of life and wants to sabotage my happiness and anytime I speak to her, I feel a wave of fear of my future that I otherwise don\u2019t feel. She has given me anxiety attacks while I am at work, because all I think is how I will not succeed and it makes me physically ill.\n\nIt hurts me. It emotionally and physically destroys me and it makes me sick to my stomach that she is my mother. When she\u2019s nice, she\u2019s really really sweet and so helpful, and when she\u2019s mean I wish I never knew her. She wants me to be reliant on her, and when I\u2019m not, I am an enemy. \n\nIt especially hurts because I celebrate her wins like I am benefiting from them. I celebrate her wins like they are my own. I go out of my way to celebrate her, and I never get that in return.",

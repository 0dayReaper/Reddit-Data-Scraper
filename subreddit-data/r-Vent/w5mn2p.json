    "postText": "He was robbed and then stabbed. His lungs collapsed so now hes in another surgery. Please. Just pray for him. Even if you are athiest please do it. Hes my reason to live. I've been crying for the past 2 days.I cant lose him. Please redditors come together and whatever positive energy you have channel it and send it his way. Please Im begging.\n\nUPDATE AS OF JUL 23 7:53 PM EST: I haven't heard anything from him yet sadly. Im sure it was a very intensive lung surgery and its probably been around a day and a half since the surgery was performed and an hour from being 2 days since he last texted me. Thank you to all who have given their love, good wishes, and prayers towards the love of my life and I. Have an amazing day or night!\n\nHES ALIVE HES ALIVE HE MADE IT HE TEXTED ME. OUR PRAYERS WERE ANSWERED",

I gashed my thigh once with a balisong and thought I was gonna die because it took 20 minutes for me to stop the bleeding and honestly looking back it wasn't even a lot. I couldn't even imagine a knife IN my gut. I'm not saying its cool you got stabbed because it's definitely not. But I hope you heal from this smoothly and can look back on it as a testament to how fucking strong you actually are rather than getting PTSD from the experience. All the same good luck and stay safe out there homie.\n\nBalls.",

I know it can be hard to eat especially under such stress so removing the chewing part and just blending some fruits does me wonders, it sounds small but more calories and sugar can make a world of a difference.\n\nDo you have any update?",

    "postText": "It was announced that Elliot Page and his wife are divorcing and a lot of comments say they aren't surprised and I feel the same. I even saw a comment that said \"my now wife is transitioning and it's taking a toll on our marriage but I'm trying.\" No shit it's taking a toll on your marriage!\n\nLook, I love my boyfriend for everything *he* is. Inside but especially out. He's the perfect *man* for me and there's nothing like a *man's* arms around me and having great sex with him and his *penis*. If he wanted to transition to a female, it would break my heart and I would be by her side but break it off romantically. You can say all you want that that ain't right and makes me a shitty person and I would be but I'm a straight woman who likes *men* and need dick to fuck with a *real* man.\n\n**Edit: I'd like to clarify that I'm not at all calling FTMs not \"real\" men and vice versa. Some seemed to have understood that while others took it the wrong way. I'd like to say I'm sorry about that and didn't meant to offend anyone.",

While some will stay to support them while still romantically involved with them you're not obligated to stay with a person if they change themselves in any way. People can't really change their sexuality, usually though some people will make exceptions. \n\nJust your support should be enough.

Some people aren't bi, and that's fine, we don't truly expect your sexuality to change for us, even if we had a great romance. Because that romance was built on the fact that you were attracted to a man. In that case, if she reveals that she is a woman, well, its your business on whether or not to continue that relationship.\n\n(If it's purely about the genitals though, not all trans people get bottom surgery or feel dysphoric about their parts, so if that's what you're worried about rather than the actual gender or being in a wlw relationship, talk to her about it).",

When somone you've known for a long time changes important parts of their identity to better suit them, it can be hard. If you are bi, and you were attracted to your partner prior to transition, one would think you would be attracted afterwards, but sometimes it just doesn't work that way. Sometimes we aren't as attractive as before. I wouldn't worry about it too much, though. Unless you need the genitals to be cis genitals (ie, \"I only date Real Men with Real Dicks\") , you're probably doing fine. Above all else, don't lead your partner on.

I was presenting female from when we met up until less than a year ago when I finally came to terms with myself. It was a rough few months in the beginning of coming out. He wasn't sure he could stay with me because he isn't as attracted to men as he is women. After a lot of confusion and heart-wrenching conversation we realized that his problem was primarily the physical stuff, which I'm not really interested in anyways. There were a few other issues he had that we were able to iron out as well and some we're still working on, but things seem to be going well for both of us now. I think a lot of the issues people have with partners transitioning come from the misunderstanding that to be trans you have to go \"all in\" which isn't realistic or desirable for many of us.",

I like a woman who wraps gifts really nicely in flowery paper and will bake me brownies, I just like femininity A LOT so that if that woman all the sudden wanted to go on hunting trips and getting dudely growing facial hair, the attraction would not be there.\n\nI can relate to this, it goes beyond looks too as a lot of transitioning people's personality changes.\n\nBasically: I am not attracted to masculinity or people that veer too far from the very feminine side of the spectrum. Those are my tastes and people are allowed their preferences especially since I do not care what other people do, are into etc etc\n\nAlso I would probably date a trasitioned mtf if they really were very feminine in terms of personality and looks (not all mtf trans people are into femme stuff) since at that point they are offering everything I'm into so essentially to me, they are women.",

I asked him what he wanted out of us. I wanted him to be with someone who could be what he liked and was attracted to. There was much uncertainty, but it was very very obvious he didn\u2019t care about my gender and was willing to make an exception for me. Unfortunately, I fucked up on accident and found someone when I apparently told him I\u2019d wait for him. (I have a shitty memory, anyone in my family will tell you that) Anyways, long story short, you\u2019re attracted to whoever. Sometimes you care more about the memories than the gender and sometimes gender is very important.",

I'm not saying that OP has to [want to] fuck a man with a vag in order not to be transphobic. She likes men with dicks. That's fine. I was just saying that the sentence (and the whole paragraph tbh) sounds an awful lot like saying real men have dicks (which is transphobic). Even if that's not what she was (consciously or unconsciously) implying, I think it's important to call her out because:\n\n* 1: \"I'm a straight woman who likes men and need dick to fuck with a real man\" seems to mean that BECAUSE she's a straight woman she needs dick to fuck with a man. Your straightness makes you attracted to men, not exclusively dick (that is the difference between preference and sexual orientation, which is also important to make sure to understand).\n\n* 2: This is a common transphobic dogwhistle that people should know about (when reading them or using them unknowingly).\n\n* 3: While everyone is allowed to have preferences, they should be careful about the contexts they voice them in. This context is \"if I'm straight and my partner transitions I'd leave them because I'm straight\". No need to mention (so profusely) her preferred sexual partner's dick or lack thereof. It's kinda like saying \"yeah I fully support [insert minority] but it's my preference not to date/fuck them\" in a context discussing something about that minority. Just weird and inappropriate.\n\n\nAlso as another commenter said the idea of a \"real man\" is super toxic and harms men in general (straight, gay, cis and trans alike), and imo its use should be avoided.",

Suppression and denial can be so deep rooted that you truly don't believe that you are trans. I doubt any trans person would willingly want to deceive their partner and the sake of their own relationship by purposefully hiding their identity lol.\n\nYour post assumes that when two people get in a relationship together that at the beginning they both understand how they feel in their own skin and that it will never change, even when presented with new information and experiences. That is just not how every person operates nor is it how all relationships operate. \n\nI do agree that you shouldn't get into a relationship with someone if you have been hiding your gender identity because it does affect areas like trust in a relationship, and it can definitely be seen as deceitful, but it really isn't that  black and white.

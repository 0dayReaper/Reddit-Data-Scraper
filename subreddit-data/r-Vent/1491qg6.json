There\u2019s no reason why a grown person has to be putting their misplaced anger on to me and throwing a fucking tantrum! Ugh I also hate having to be left with the long lines due to it being short staff due to people leaving for the bullshit like at least pay us more money! I don\u2019t even wanna give them notice I just don\u2019t wanna show up! Stupid dumb ass jerk ass bitch ass people.",

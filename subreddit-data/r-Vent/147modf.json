    "postText": "The title explains everything.\nI like to have a few friends as I don't see a point in lots of friends. Usually I'm the one texting them, I am always the one initiating the conversation, they barely are the one to start it. I feel like no one at my school likes me or wants to be friends. I am trying real hard to get to know them but they don't do the same.\nI just want to completely give up making friends, like idk what I'm doing wrong for them to not want to talk to me, just even once. Idc about them texting me daily, just once In a while is fine with me.",

Honestly the simplest thing is enough. I don't want to bring it up with them cause it might make things awkward with them when we go to college since all my friends are in the same class as me.",

    "postText": "I've always known this was coming. I've been working in the film industry for 10 years now. I love my job. It's so fast paced and fun. I get so into what I do and there's a lot of comradery every day. Being on set and being apart of big movies and shows gives me such a rush. My job is very physical though and the days are 12 hour days. I have always wanted to be a mom. It's a bigger dream to me than getting into the Industry was. In my career, I've only met one other woman who has had a kid and she had to leave the industry after he was born. It also doesn't help that most of the people I work with openly talk about how much they hate children and think pregnancy is disgusting. My husband also works in the industry and we discussed how he would work a show then I would work a show so we could switch off and share the home life responsibilities. We are talking about starting a family soon and losing my career is really hitting me. I know technically I can go back whenever, but it's not going to be full time like it is now. This post is just me feeling a little sad over the changes. I know I will love my kids, but going to a single income and not having the film industry consume my life anymore is going to be a huge change. I will welcome the changes, but they also scare me.",

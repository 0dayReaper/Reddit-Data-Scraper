It\u2019s been like 3 years too. \u201cSays the girl\u201d SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP! \u201cIt would be better if we went to the woman\u2019s section \u201c IT WOULD NOT! I\u2019m so tired of it. I\u2019d rather they never referred to me at all. They get worse as the years progresses as if I\u2019m in some sort of phase I\u2019m sick of it. ITS NOT THAT HARD I swear to God ARGGGGGGGGHG I going to strangle the next person that does it because THEY KNOW. THEYVE KNOWN FOR YEARSSS",

It ESPECIALLY hurts when your out and they ignore that or are straight up transphobic. \n\nIf it's safe enough, don't take their bullshit. Correct them and be rude. Fucks sake, maybe even misgender them back. \n\nI hope those assholes stop misgendering you.",

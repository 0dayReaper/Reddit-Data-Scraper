    "postText": "\nPersonally I think I can be quite talkative and social. Sometimes I\u2019m not, it depends how I feel and who they are.\n\nBut when people call me shy I hate it. I get anxious, frustrated and give up on interacting with them.\n\nMy partners brother and his wife came over from another state. I was intimidated meeting everyone the first few times, spoke, but not my usual self. But was eager to be more outspoken this time. I invited my sister as I like our families meeting. But my sister dominated the conversations, she was friendly but talked so much about her wedding planning 70% of the time with my partners sister in law (they got married recently). Other 20% was based off my sister joking about her past drinking history. They had banter and interacted which was great but I was left not talking much.\n\nToday my partners brother told him I\u2019m soft spoken and shy. He\u2019s nice but I absolutely hate it when people think I\u2019m shy. I want to give up and not show them my talkative side.\n\nI am always mindful - making sure everyone is not left out and they are included in conversations. Ive made sure my sister or anyone feels included in previous events, so the fact my sister kept talking and over taking the conversation frustrates me too.\n\nAh sorry rambling, just annoyed and deflated.",

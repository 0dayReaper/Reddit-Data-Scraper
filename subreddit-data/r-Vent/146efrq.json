    "postText": "Hello, I'm 18 and my friend group reaches from 17-19 just to give a picture of the people. Most of my friends including that one friend let's call him h are in the same class as me and we also spend quite some time together on Discord after school.\nThe problem started occuring to me a couple of days ago when h changed his profile to a crossed out LGBTQ-flagg and his name to something against it. Now to my problem these feeinds tend to make weird jokes. It's the kind of jokes where outsiders be like wtf, because it seems racist or problematic in a way. We just know each other for quite some time and we are an interracial friendgroup therefore it's fun as long as it stays between us all. But the anti LGBTQ doesn't sit right with me, because it seems to be genuinely his opinion idk if I can't read the room correctly but it makes me Hella uncomfortable. Should I ask him to change it and probably be ridiculed or just leave it. By the way I muted and unfriended him cause i felt better afterwards.\n\nSorry for the typos English is not my first language",

Just leave it, especialy if he is a homophobic person. You did the right thing muting him just in case. \n\n( also your english is amazing :))",

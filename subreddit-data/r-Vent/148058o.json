It\u2019s been hard because how do I tell people, oh yeah I never dated him but I loved him and now my heart is shattered. He had his phone taken and he can\u2019t get it back until after HS. I really loved him and I see exactly where you are coming from. I hope you can find someone who treats you better, and you weren\u2019t stupid for what you did btw.",

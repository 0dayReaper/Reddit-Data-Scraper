I've been pushed around, told what to do, what to be, how to be me and I can't hold it in anymore man I just wanna be me and no one likes me for me so I put on a mask to at least have one friend and after 4 months I called him out for treating me like shit and he blocked me. I'm torn between balling my eyes out and punching a wall. I've been sexually assaulted, abused drugs, been to 3 schools this year, and much more in-between. I can't try keep trying anymore because it always comes back and bites me in the ass. I'm 14 years old guys when does this shit get good? I just want life to be good. Why can't I have what everyone else has?",

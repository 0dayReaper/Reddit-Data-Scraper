    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m 30, but people think I\u2019m younger. It\u2019s weird when older people treat me like a \u201cchild\u201d because they think I\u2019m a teen/in early 20s. Sometimes children think I\u2019m a teen. Guys around 22 seem interested in me, they think I\u2019m always a decade younger, around 21. But then they realize my age and are freaked out lol. (Side note: they\u2019re too young for me). Some guys my age/older also seem interested, but when they realize my age they loose interest because they are interested in younger women. I\u2019m not really petite. Average 5\u20194\u201d. Why would people think I look younger?",

There are countless sects that are far more at war with each other than they are with other religions or non-believers in general.\n\nRoman Catholicism was born when Latin-speaking Christians merged it with the dying Roman Empire. It was a foregone conclusion that the Church of Rome would become a mega-colonizer throughout the world, responsible for millions of deaths. Other Christian sects also merged with politics but to a lesser extent, Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Church of England, etc.\n\nSome Christian sects never gained political power, so they were unable to force their views on others. Chaldeans and Copts. Ironically enough, both Chaldeans and Copts are known for their honesty -- a must if you're surrounded by religious majorities that hate you and will use any excuse to do you harm.",

Muslim has a very rich history of this exact thing happening, as well as its values and beliefs changing according to whoever the leader's agenda. I believe it had an intent of treating men and women equally until the prophet Muhammad died. Hindu is also following this. A good question to ask is \"which came first, the caste system or the religion?\". Does religion justify the practice, or does is the practice justified by religion?\n\nIt's my understanding that all these things evolve as does the society, which is why we still see religion evolving to this very day.",

' If they turn away from this then know that Allah does not love those who refuse to obey Him and His Messenger.\"\n\n5:32, 33, and 34 are brutal verses, I agree. But they aren't referencing nonbelievers specifically, more like those who intentionally defame our God. Additionally, the \"mischievous\" people could refer to people who commit ungodly acts, such as rape or murder.\n\nI strongly believe those who do not believe in Allah (swt) as their God should not be punished or ostracized; personal beliefs are personal beliefs, as emphasises by the Prophet Muhammad. At the end of the day, it all boils down to interpretation.\n\nI'm a moderately liberal Muslim, so I take these interpretations as liberally as I can. Thanks for the comment!",

It\u2019s widely accepted in Christianity that Mary was 12-14 years of age when she married Joseph and had a virgin birth. There is no singular proof in the Quran of the age of the prophet and the woman he married. There\u2019s 0 proof in the text or talk of it in regular Islamic practice. There\u2019s been a lot of religious DISCUSSION, and depending on the scholar, it is believed that the age of the prophet\u2019s wife varies from 14-20. Obviously, in these times, 14 is still too young. But different time, different context. But still, 14 was the oldest age of Mary when she was married. There are also different sects of the religion that believe different things, different discussions. How is it true that many devout Muslims know that the prophet did NOT marry a 9 year old and believe this and practice with this knowledge. But some idiots online and on Reddit who do not practice Islam, didn\u2019t read the Quran, did not research credible sources are saying that it is true..? So now it is??? Like how does that make sense, Muslims don\u2019t even believe that LMAO",

And of course when you point out any of this stuff, people either get mad at you for \u201cdisrespecting their religion\u201d, or they wash away all of it with a vague notion that it\u2019s symbolic and didn\u2019t literally happen. Which seems like a terribly convenient, post-hoc rationalization.\n\nI know the Quran has some differences from biblical text, but to the extent it shares the contents I described, it is an evil book.

You really are desperately grasping at straws.   \nAnd again, the whole Mo marrying a child thing has been part of your relgioh for CENTURIES. You lot have only recently tried pretending this wasn't a thing, as you've slowly grasped that being a mamssive pedo is frowned upon. Again, since you're clear too dense to get it, your own book literally says this. All your records say this. It IS true. YOU are the one in denial here. The fact that you're trying to claim this now, after this has been edsstablished historical fact for agers, only highlights the sad retconning you lot will try, hoping everyone else forgets.

Unfortunately, they rarely do.\n\nReligion, at it\u2019s heart, is a culture.  Christianity is a bit different because instead of being a body of knowledge, culture, customs, and history (like many eastern religions), Christianity is a system of control.  It is a system of *keeping* knowledge *away* from the people who practice it and feeding back carefully selected pieces depending on the agenda of whoever\u2019s in charge.  \nExample: Getting the peasants to understand sustainable farming is hard, so instead I\u2019ll tell them, \u201cDon\u2019t eat meat on Fridays or God will be angry!\u201d  \nOr for a more modern example, \u201cAmerica is a white, Christian nation and we need to fight to keep it that way or else the devils on the Left will destroy us!\u201d  Nevermind that 90% of the history used to back that up has been cherry picked while the conflicting facts have been suppressed.\n\nThis is why there are hundreds of different \u201cChristian\u201d sects, (and multiple cults,) who all work from the same base.  \u201cStrong men\u201d show up and think, \u201cYep, I deserve loyal followers\u201d and spin up a Christianity-based organization to dodge taxes, brainwash desperate people, and gain power.  \n\nBecause Christianity is a system of control, and American Christianity has become the worst kind of culture that is slowly, sorry, very quickly destroying our country.  \n\nAnd if our democracy falls to a \u201cStrong Man\u201d leader, no one is coming to save us.  There will be no WWII-style \u201csovereign fight against the baddies\u201d.  \nNope.  Instead the rest of the world will fall, just like we did/are, and by the time the Millennials have grand-kids, democracy will be dead and no one will be able to start it up again.  \n\nAmerica was the world\u2019s last shot at getting it right.  Unfortunately, the same type of asshole, (and his wife), is at the heart of every single misstep we\u2019ve made along the way.  Including the time before America\u2019s founding.  Because we keep voting for him.\nAnd now that same breed of asshole is gaining power at an alarming rate (because we are still voting for him, and we have changed the rules so only that kind of asshole can have a real chance of winning).  Hell, the Supreme Court is making rulings at breakneck speed and each one is tearing MASSIVE holes in our system that will take generations to repair.  If they keep this up (ie if Republicans win the midterms this year and president in 2024) the damage caused by their combined decisions will be IMPOSSIBLE to repair.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the point.  They\u2019ve been waiting *at* *least* 40-50 years for this moment and if you think anyone on The Right is gonna preserve your freedoms, I\u2019m terribly sorry but you\u2019re delusional. \n\nThe Left isn\u2019t that much better, (they\u2019ve co-signed a lot of bullsh*t over the years and love signing checks to themselves with our money).  But at least there are a still few people who genuinely want to make the world a better place.  The Right can\u2019t say that.  \nAlso, I\u2019ve yet to see a single thing The Right accuses The Left of doing \u201cin secret\u201d that The Right isn\u2019t also doing out in the open, often on live TV. \n\nUnfortunately, the sad truth is, we\u2019re not living in a political duopoly, but a monopoly.  The good, smart people who should be taking these civil servant jobs don\u2019t even run anymore, and the ones that did have all quit.  \n\nWe, the Americans, are the only people on Planet Earth with the power to stop this bullet train to mutually assured destruction.  But instead too many of us enjoy being *fucking* *Christian!*\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk.\n\nPlease vote.",

Basically following another religion of the exact same name and with some of the same tenants save for the key changes. And there's even sects of supposed religion that outright state explicitly that the holders of it are allowed to be hateful.\n\nSo continuing example, there would be a Christianity that follows the teachings of Christ as they are meant to be, but also a Hateful Christianity, where the teachings have been perverted to suit the desires of the proponents of that mirror-world version of the faith.\n\nThe pastors that stand at the pulpit and call all gays evil are indeed preaching a religion, a hateful one.",

            "comment": "Well, to be honest Christians are no better but a joke now. Christianity in the West is about extreme tolerance, accepting everything and if you tolerate everything you don't stand for nothing anymore. You literally promoting degeneracy by saying that Jesus was \"gay\"? ( I know it's not all but some priests and pastors think that) and you talk about it like it was nothing, accept single moms like they were honorable women (I'm not saying they are bad but they can't be seen as an example), letting people go in the church dressed like they are going to the club, don't punish adultery ( not even shame them anymore) and many other F up things. However, Jews and muslims have been able to keep their religion like it always was without modifying it just because it hurts people feelings, which is ridiculous. Being a Christian now is just like being n atheist because if those Western Christians really believed in God and respected him, never the West would be so low on morals and values, with no discipline nor self control. And look at you now, families are broken and your kids are confused and depressed, men act like women and women like men, your marriage institutions are dying, you're killing yourselves at a higher rate than in any other religion (even women in Afghanistan don't kill themselves while I think have some of the he most disgusting lives in this planet and have more mental strength than the average American man or woman living in relative comfort with no wars and everything), birth rates are dropping super fast and so on. Your tolerance will lead to your collapse eventually, so enjoy while you still can as you think your religion is the best in the World.",

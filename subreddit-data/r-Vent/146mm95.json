    "postText": "I (16) made a post like this a while ago, referencing my friend liking the boy (17) who liked me.\nthis is a sort of long story, but I started talking to him to get him with my friend. Somehow it turned into me being a sort of support system. I was there for him. I offered him my kindness advice. I always supported him. I made him feel like he was worth something. At least that\u2019s what he was saying, and implying. I never saw anything flirtatious because he was a naturally flirtatious person and was until recently when he said some very flirtatious stuff like call me I\u2019m pretty and was making and insinuating really flirtatious jokes and that night he was like I want more from you I want you, and so he basically confessed that he wanted to date me and I rejected him because my friend wanted him I see now that all of his \u201cjokes \u201cwe\u2019re actually more flirtatious he could be a really rude person sometimes, and got on my nerves, but also i got pissed easy because he just can piss you off so easy. I say that with kindness lol. but I really did care for him platonically like I wanted to see him succeed and be happy because he had a lot of personal troubles. Anyway, after the confession, he was really dry when he said that nothing was wrong and I try to be as kind to him because I really did care of him and think of him as a close friend and he said that he was in the hospital and sick and \nSo I understand that, but I didn\u2019t know the time. So he was acting really cold and weird when I didn\u2019t know when he was sick or not so I felt really bad today. I followed him back on Instagram and I just started talking to him and it was sort of just messing with him like I was being really nonchalant and I forget how we got on this but he said I don\u2019t know why I painted you as a saint, blah blah blah I realize things now blah blah blah. I don\u2019t know why I took small human decency and act of kindness are so big, and I agreed with him like I agreed that he was in a bad place, and all those things are true and I said, I\u2019m happy that I made some sort of impact. I helped you emotionally and he went \u201cEh\u201d and that really pissed me off because he knew and knows that I care about him and I want to see him succeed and be happy and so I go off on him and he finally explains because he beat around the bush a lot when I asked him directly did you really not take anything from my support? Did it mean nothing? And he basically said after being rejected it didn\u2019t. Now any other dude i wouldn\u2019t go to the trouble of talking to but we\u2019re still \u201ccool\u201d and joke and whatnot and annoy each other but he was being an ass trying to be a badass going \u201cI dont care\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re neutral now\u201d (when i literally know we\u2019re neutral i was literally the one who rejected him) and keep saying all this stuff and beating around my question asking if he ever really truly took the heart anything I said, or if I actually helped him and he basically said no or did at the time and it doesn\u2019t anymore and that was the answer that I wanted I didn\u2019t want this beating around the bush because when he said it like I was asking, did he really not, he kept beating around the bush and that was really really annoying He was just being kind of rude and trying to act all cool and Billy badass which was unnecessary I genuinely don\u2019t care, but I forget how we got to this, but he whipped out that he has cancer and now I feel really really bad for rejecting him because he went on the edgelord rant about how his standards are high and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s good to have high standards, but he said I\u2019m going to reject people out of hate and if they\u2019re ugly, I\u2019m going to tell them blah and how he doesn\u2019t want to cure his cancer because nobody did anything worth him living for and it was kind of cringe he but I feel really bad that he has cancer in the throat and I just told him I\u2019m there for him. I might be missing some details so feel free to ask for an elaboration to get a better idea of what was going on.",

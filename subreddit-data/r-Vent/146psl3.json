    "postText": "the reason I love helping people is because I literally hate everyone and I just think people are the absolute worst but when people are having mental breakdowns or struggling or just like need help it forces me to see the good in them. I think the reason I \"hate everyone\" is because I got so scared of getting hurt from past trauma that I didn't want to risk being loved. I don't want to believe there is good in the world sometimes, because it's too comfortable staying alone and sad and afraid. but when I see people going through exactly what I had to go through, knowing how extreme and unimaginable emotional pain can be, I have to help them. I don't care who they are, nobody deserves that because it's the worst fucking pain in the world. I can't let another person let go, I can't let another person believe that they don't deserve living that badly. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't help someone struggling that wasn't able to make it through. because you never know when it's someone's breaking point, you never know what they would've done if you weren't there. but I was there. and it will always be worth it, I will always love it. I will always feel a little more complete knowing that I could've encouraged someone to maybe keep going for just one more day. until they enjoyed the days on their own again. but the second it's all over, the second they look up and realize that they weren't alone this time, it makes me think that there is good. because when i'm forced to defend people to themselves, i'm forced to understand them. I have to think about everything that could possibly make a person the way that they are, and in that moment when people realize they didn't have to give up, I see beauty. I see potential, and I see seeds just waiting to grow. it makes me feel fulfilled when I have to reach deep inside of someone's soul to truly see who they are. it erases my judgement, and allows me to see beauty without feeling terrified for once.",

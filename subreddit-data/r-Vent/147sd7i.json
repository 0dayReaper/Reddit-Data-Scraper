I finally got here and todays my last day and I\u2019m sick. I woke up with bad congestion and I haven\u2019t gotten better. There were a few more things I wanted to do before leaving tomorrow but idk if I\u2019ll have the energy to do them. So here I am laying in this dumb hotel room hoping I get well enough to see one last show this evening. I\u2019m so mad right now. Who the hell gets sick in the summer?",

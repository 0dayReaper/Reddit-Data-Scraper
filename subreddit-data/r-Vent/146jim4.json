    "postText": "Hello. \nI don\u2019t know where to start. For starters this isn\u2019t a s-note lol. I genuinely just have a hard time forming words to explain this.\n\nI guess for context there\u2019s three important things to know: autism, depression, and gay. These are all interconnected in my life story.\n\nTo begin, the autism I have makes processings a bit of a challenge, yet I\u2019m still able to retain my sense of explanation. This also effects relationships, friendships, etc.\n\nSecondly, I have depression. Not the aesthetic, teenage love story depression, but the one that shakes you to it\u2019s core in scattered episodes, and you find it hard to even wake up and leave your space. \n\nFinally, I\u2019m gay. This also kinda had an effect on how I saw friendships, relationships, and my own personal views. I am a more neutral, masculine and feminine guy, who acts on deliberations alone, as to maintain a neutrality.\n\n\nThe issue at hand, is how I perceive love. For a final bit of context, I only had my first crush at 16. I\u2019m 21. and following the crush, I became infatuated, in not the healthiest way. My second crush was last summer when I worked with many other lgbt people or ally\u2019s, as the community at the workplace was quite youthful. (18-22) \n\nWe have a problem though. You may call it cliche, or may laugh it off, but regardless of how you see love, you can imagine the classic gay shame of falling for your straight friend whom you feel most comfortable with, as they don\u2019t go out of their way to make it accepting/awkward, but one who\u2019s more tuned in and knows what\u2019s up. \n\nWhile the crush has subsided as seeing him was rare, (due to school), I do miss him. But I don\u2019t know if I could ever tell him, because I\u2019m literally kept awake at night with the fear of being responsible for the dissolution of my best male friend, with whom is only one of a few I am friends with, as there\u2019s the same level of understanding where you almost feel like \u201cone of the boys\u201d. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know what to do. I know the friendship is already hard to maintain due to distance, but I want to keep him around, since he\u2019s one of only a few who truly make me happy, whether it be his energy, or something else, I just don\u2019t know why I feel so much guilt and shame and anxiety, and this has sent me into a bit of a spiral.\n\nMy apologies if this isn\u2019t the best way to vent. First time using this space.\n\nI don\u2019t wanna put my rose coloured shades on, because I know that would get me nowhere but more into the trench of the already existing insanity that I find my self in. Lol\nSorry- anyways. Yeah that\u2019s the situation. If you do see this and have some advice, thoughts, or otherwise I welcome you to hear it. :) \n\nI hope you are doing well though, regardless.",

    "postText": "All my life, I always struggled with this thing called making friends. I don't know what makes me different, I have always moral and kind but I just seem to be different in some normal way. Although I'm lucky enough to have a handful of people I can confidently call my friends. But I always know that they will never always be by my side when I need them, even though I'm always one call away and will drive to where ever you are in the middle of the night at 1am as fast as I can drive if they ever needed someone by their side. Which for the record.... I've done... Maybe a couple of times for some of my friends... Does that make me any more or less of a friend? No. A good person? No as well. I think its just human instinct at that point to be always be their for someone when their struggling, suffering, having their worst day ever in their life and alone. Unless your me, then you just voluntarily choose to suffer by yourself, mentally draining your sanity, unable to tell anyone your drowning in your own pool of negative and self-deprecating thoughts cause you internally tell yourself that your life is nothing compared to what others deal with on their day to day life, that you should be grateful with what you have and be strong and move on, while driving home from work. But hit me up in the dm's anytime, and I'll be their in a flick of finger, as that is always the right thing to do. I guess that where I got my addiction of driving around the city, or where ever I want in the middle of the night just before I get home from work, listening to the best Lofi, chill, heartbreaking music, coffee in hand while driving casually at 50 miles per hour.  \n\n\nWow... That whole paragraph took me a total of 319 words, just to say that I struggled having friends and having healthy relationships in life, and have shitty mental health because of it. Damn, wished I was this good when writing 250-300 worded essays for school, I could've struck gold in English. Anyways Just wanted to say that I still fucking love my friends regardless of how they treat me and how I treat them, cause at the end of the day, They stuck with me, for almost 5 years, 10 for my closer friends. And I still have countless and endless core memories with them, and I will never replace them for anything more. Now to tell what I wanted to vent about  \n\n\n For the past 6 months, I have been working my first job at a local thriving restaurant as a baker/chef at a well known area at our city for good food. and honestly having been a blast at my work place. I extremely got lucky with my first job, as my bosses were nice and have this fiery passion with the restaurant. Most of my coworkers are nice and beyond amazing, emphasis on the most as their will always be that one or two coworkers that doesn't  like you and I accept that, I don't like them as well, but I still try to get along with them as they're all amazing in their own right. Despite me being there for 6 months, weirdly enough I don't have anyone that I can confidently say they're my close friend there. And that really hurts to say since, I spend 6 days per week, sometimes even 7 days a week at that place, and don't get me wrong, I really fucking love working there, I would still work there even if its the last thing I do, I'm really committed to the place, but it just hurts to think that I go there 6 days a week for 6 months, and have made no progress in getting close with anyone but that doesn't mean I'm a loner or like I don't talk with anyone at my work place... I have co-worker friends, and I talk to them a lot, banter with them, give them rides home, shared drinks with them, they've shared a lot of experiences and memories with me and each other But ahh, Its also hard and complicated to explain what I'm thinking and feeling in the same time. Like its hard to vent and put into words what I have been feeling in the restaurant and in my co working space. I guess the best way to explain it is with the lyrics of this song called \"that friend\" made by Mad Tsai, and It goes like \"I guess I'm that friend, The one that hangs with the group, That ain't close enough to anyone to have someone to talk to, I got friends but I'm still lonely, If we played the quiet game, I might win all the trophies\". I've literally have a handful of moments like this in my work space, and it hurts... It just hurts... Knowing that you'll always be that one friend, that's always there and is just there for no reason but to just exist. and Its weird for me since I'm an extroverted person, but somehow I'm easily shoved aside, or get casted beyond the shadows of my co workers even our new co workers. Which is even more depressing to see that my newer younger coworker are getting along so much better with everyone than me, even though they've only been there for 2 months... Knowing you're trying your best to get close with these amazing people, but the new coworkers were just able to snap a finger and bam, everyone gets a long with him. I don't understand, maybe I lack charisma? Also I just want to say, that acknowledge that I am jealous, and that I am experiencing envy of my new co worker whom did nothing wrong, I know its a me problem. Me and him are actually pretty cool with each other and get along pretty well, we've even had drinks with each other. But again I'm just jealous of what he has and what I lack. It pains my heart, whenever I see my coworkers just have so much more fun with him, than me. No one has ever laughed/talked that much or had that much fun with me compared to when they're with him. Like what happened last night, as always I was drinking coffee with my coworkers and him after a long really hard day at work. We just wanted to chill and relax, And as always it starts with just them talking with him, I'll get some words out or I'll be able to talk sometimes, but when I talk there's this awkward silence/pause. Then they continue talking. I noticed those moments, but I don't mind them since I'm still enjoying their company, and they seem to enjoy my company as well I guess, or maybe its convenient for them since I have a car and we can drive around where ever we want and get home as late as we want and safely as well, and they're just using me, but I don't really mind it, since I've been doing these sorts of things with my other friends so I don't really mind. The night continues as always and went it was time to go home as it was like 1am, we all jumped back to my car, and while I was driving, still they were all having such a nice time and talking, and honestly I'm happy still at that time since I was their experiencing it and hearing about it with them, and I get to drive them home safely. But as the night continues, I just noticed that they've completely forgot about me, as they were really having a lot of fun talking with each of themselves. And I was just driving them home, I guess my excuse was I was just really focused on driving, but I could hear everything they say, every word they said, and I couldn't say anything since I couldn't relate to them at all. I felt so out of place suddenly. My feeling of happiness quickly became loneliness, as I was suffering alone with a group of people in the car having the times of their lives, while I'm just their driving yet listening but not knowing what to say to them. Maybe I was tired as well, that's why I didn't know what to say. But that hurts again... You guys are in a car together, yet still you are that friend, \" The one that hangs with the group, That ain't close enough to anyone to have someone to talk to, I got friends but I'm still lonely, If we played the quiet game, I might win all the trophies\". I also like to add, that as soon as I dropped him home, the whole night was just an awkward quiet night, as everyone was in their own worlds and at their phones. And for me, I was still suffering alone. As I couldn't say anything. I just have to deal with it, and move from it, not think anything from it. Also couldn't talk anyone about this  in my life, neither my family nor my close friends as its a small little thing in life, and their are other things in life far bigger to think about it and deal with than my bullshit. So yea, I'm venting here, where no one else will and see this from my personal life except some wonderful people of the internet. Enjoy devouring this shit of a vent.",

I tried to do Better Help because it's always being pitched as a \"low cost\" option --- and I didn't have the $200.00 required up front.  Therapy isn't an affordable or accessible solution for everyone, and that's a serious problem.",

I wouldn't know about people *attacking*  certain disorders, I don't find myself associating with perpetually angry people who use their mental health issues as a personality trait. Also not sure why you would assume I see being bipolar in a negative light, some of my chemicals are imbalanced and a few synapses don't fire correctly, so I need to balance them manually. It's not crippling unless you let it be.",

After this interaction I will literally forget your existence, my opinion shouldn't matter, nor should anyone's whose name and number you don't know. It's incredibly weird that people need approval from literal strangers. Some self-actualization would do you a great deal of good.",

But its something that saved my life so i think we should a start for all insurenses to pay for therapy! \n\nRember therapy isnt a forever thing, my therepist said due to my age ill need like 2 more and ill never fully be cured from anything but rembering the techiques to get through that is something usefull that even without therapy you can try! Rember that somtimes talking to sombody can help a lot to and therapy isnt the whole therapy makes up 1% of the work the rest is you \n\nSo recomend but also understand that sometimes therapy is really expensive *also better help isnt bad and i used for it while but i came to find that i can lie to well on there than i can in person as i personally am extreamly blushy whene lieing even under a terrible deppression that makes dripping red lines down my arms* but dont go blidining recomending people it. My therapy is 5k a year not including phyc and meds. *thats totalls to 7k* becuase each session with her is 50$ becuase of insurence *she wont tell me what the base money thats just an estmeate* i see her once a week  my phyc and i meet once a month. \n\nBetter alternitives\nMental hospital no *they kinda suck where i am atleast*\nSchool counslars yeah they are okay but be very carefull\nBetterhelp be okay with who you live with possibly hearing your therapy calls and its great\nCheap therapy FUCK NO my last therepist was cover under insurense fully and she wasnt terrible but never gave me a toolbox and had CPS at my door",

The counselor spent most of the first session trying to get the software to work.  So far.. it's been useless.   \n\n\nThe thing is.. Therapy.. with the right therapist and a willingness to work.. is a fucking game changer.   \n\n\nMy first therapist would not keep his hands off me.  Nothing overtly sexual just always sitting too close on the couch.  Hugging me goodbye.   I managed because I was young didn't know any better.. but after a while I just couldn't force myself to go back.  I didn't really understand why.  Until a decade later I was sexually assaulted by a disgusting urgent care doctor with my husband sitting in the waiting room!  It brought back all the memories and I finally understood why those therapy sessions bothered me so much.     \n\n\nSo I tried therapy again.  And it was totally different with a new therapist.  Legit saved my life.  But also gave me tools I needed to cope with the fact that I have a mental illness.    \n\n\nBut no life runs smooth with chronic depression.. I've had therapists at various times over the years.  Some long term.  Some short.  Some absolutely fabulous.  One woman whose life story I knew in living color detail down to the name of the person her spouse was cheating on her with... but after two months she still couldn't remember my name or marital status.... while holding my file in her hand.  (NEXT!)  \n\n\nMy point is that if I had stopped at the first one I don't think I'd still be alive today.   And it could be that the ones I didn't like... just might not have been a good match for me.  Their style might work great for someone else.    \n\n\nThe right therapy is amazing.  And hard.  But worth it... and can take forever to find a good fit.    \n\n\nWhich is why the endless waiting lists are so discouraging.  Been trying to get a therapist now for over a year.  I'm on a half a dozen lists.   Not even a peep.    \n\n\nHow is a person in crisis supposed to deal with that?  As frustrated as I get.. I can only imagine how heartbreakingly difficult for someone in crisis to finally get up the ability to make that call.. and IF they are accepting new patients.. be told that they are \"booking out about 10 MONTHS\".    \n\n\nHealthcare in America is broken.",

I\u2019ve had a great experience with my therapist and with my not so great insurance each visit comes out to $75. \nI\u2019m able to afford it if I do a session every 2 weeks. I hope this info is helpful to someone!",

You just need to talk to people who have been thru what you been through and survived, and try to figure out what all their methods of surviving and apply it to your situation. No matter how bad you are at something, there are humans everywhere in life that were worse than you at it, and still beat it.",

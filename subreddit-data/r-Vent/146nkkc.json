No one has ever looked at me the way he has, like the world revolves around me and there's nothing more incredible. I've never felt so strongly about someone so quickly and it's so terrifying. I can't take anymore heartbreak, but I wouldn't mind if he does:) I can't wait for my family to meet him and do everything together and give him so many cute lil gifts. I haven't been so hopeful, happy, and just content ever. I was worried I was having a manic episode (I'm bipolar) but he just makes me feel good and my self esteem isn't in the gutter. Such a lovely person and I can't wait to see him next:) Delete if this doesn't qualify for this subreddit, but I really didn't know where else to post\n\nP.S. Gonna tell him I love him soon, not sure when. I just wanna feel completely safe saying it, but I already know:)",

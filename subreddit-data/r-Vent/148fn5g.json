    "postText": "Lately I\u2019ve been getting really weird bursts of energy, I\u2019m so happy for no reason. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m getting better or anything. I\u2019ve final exams and I\u2019m not prepared at all. My friends think it\u2019s so weird at how energetic and happy I am. I also think it\u2019s pretty weird. I feel like there\u2019s so much going on inside my head, but I don\u2019t seem to be affected by it. Maybe on the inside, yes I do feel hurt a little on the inside, but on the outside I look like the happiest person ever. I\u2019m not even forcing this happiness, it\u2019s here by itself, it\u2019s like I\u2019m tired of being sad and I got used to being hurt that now I just don\u2019t care about being sad anymore, I don\u2019t know if that made sense. Like there\u2019s sooo much going on, like today I decided to gather all of my ex best friends notes that she used to pass to me in class and her gifts and put them in a bag and threw them under my bed, that made me feel so bad. I know in my last post it seemed like I\u2019ve recovered from this whole friendship breakup but actually I\u2019m still recovering, I\u2019m definitely doing better but I\u2019m still recovering. Also I\u2019ve exams coming up, and in vacation I\u2019d be studying too for (GAT). So why am I so \u201c happy\u201d all of a sudden? I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m actually happy or this is some kind of way to cope. Like I\u2019m hurting inside but I couldn\u2019t bother to be sad, I just smile and be so optimistic, and jump around and just seem like I don\u2019t have anything bothering me. I really am not forcing this feeling, does anyone feel the same or does anyone know what even this feeling is?",

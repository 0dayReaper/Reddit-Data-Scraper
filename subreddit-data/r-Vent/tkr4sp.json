Even treating them like they're not a real person. \n\n\nBut just like you said, it's not all women.",

Thats good and yall should. \n\nBut that being said with the positive comes the negative. \n\nIve gotten a dm request asking if i meant what i said, or if i said it to get some \"reddit bitches\" and how its great i think this way but for women towards men its different. \n\nAnd ive had a comment asking if i was a gay man trying to prove im straight, if i was looking for medals, or just straight up people just being negative in the comments\n\nBut its the internet and you cant expect anything less. Espeically as you dont know who that person is or how they were raised or what theyve been through. But that doesnt excuse trying to make everything negative \n\n1.) No, im not trying to get \"bitches\" \n\nIm deadass just expressing my love for women. \n\nNo other reason besides that women are hot. And. Yes i meant every word i said. As long as you got a good heart thats all that matters. Your apperance doesnt matter to me personally, and i know this mindset isnt just me. Keep yalls head up high. Find someone who will love you for you.\n\n2.) Im sorry men feel like they have it hard when it comes to dating, im 100% sure there is someone out there for you. Just keep looking\n\nI really do not see where my post says men arent attractive. And i dont see where it says its not different for men.\n\nI understand that it can seem unfair, but different people are allowed to have different preferences and different boundaries.\n\n3.) I am a bisexual female. Women however was on my mind specifically and i like to express that side of myself as i havent been openly able to. \n\n4.) I dont know much about medals. I dont know the point of them and i dont actively seek one out\n\nWhile yes, some comments may be jokes. And yes its the internet so like i said its not surprising. Please keep in mind not everyone has ill intent behind words. \n\nThe world itself is already dark enough. If you look on the news, youll most likely find many events that are stressful. \n\nIf someone can feel even just a little better about their day, thats all that matters.\n\nEdit: stop projecting your insecurities in my inbox \"youre only including the pretty ones. Me and other girls are still ugly \ud83d\udc79\" \"men dont get the same treatment we have to prove ourselves \ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc79\" \"not all women sre hot \ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc79\" \"youre lying whats the truth \ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc79\" \n\nLIKE HUH??? Whats that gotta do with me \ud83d\ude2d i just said all women are hot and i meant it\n\nPlease work on yourself esteem. I am just a wlw expressing her love for women",

If we are fat we are taught how to loae weight and dress in ways that hade the \"gross\" bits and put the \"desirable\" bits on display.  From what ive seen and heard a lot of dudes just think that youre either born captain america or youre not and nothing can be done to help you. If your fat you can lose weight sure, and some effort is put into male fashion but a lot of that still feels like a male gaze, and anything further than \"wash\" is seen as a monumental thing that only women do.",

But the guys who try to improve their looks, ugly or not, take it to the extremes and become creepy about it (e.g.; lookism communities).\n\nI also don\u2019t think its society as a whole telling these things to women, but women telling other women how they should look. From my experience its much more common for women to have negative remarks about a lady\u2019s appearance than a man to have negative remarks about a lady. But I grew up in a house full of women so I might be skewed there",

So no, that guy seems really sweet, and despite not craving male attention or being wet each time I see a guy, like the other girls, I can't help but be worried that I am ugly boring abomination that no one will love, cause there is no other explanation as to how most girls started dating since 6th grade, while I am in college and never had any guy have any remote interest in me, most treated me horribly and the others were just neutral, which wasn't positive in my eyes, others usually got hugs and teasing while I got people eww-ing at me and throwing things at me, and I can't live that one down, I still remember these things from high school and find it hard to move on and struggle to trust men in general, this is why i called him sweet",

    "postText": "My ex and I broke up 3 years ago. She was everything to me. I loved her more than I have ever loved anyone in my life and losing her was like losing a part of me. I struggled with depression when we broke up and I'm only starting to heal now. We don't talk to each other anymore but I still see her every now and then because we live in the same city and all I know is that she has a new boyfriend because I always see them together.\r  \n\r  \nI'm still not over her, seeing her makes me sad and completly ruins my day but I can't imagine my life without her so I obsess over her and she's all I can think about, I think I have a really unhealthy obsession and it hurts because I don't know how to stop obsessing over her.\r  \n\r  \nI've tried dating other girls but I felt nothing. I am incapable of loving someone else and even if I find that person attractive I cannot feel enough attraction to have sex with them or even kiss them. Just the thought of doing that with someone other than her repulses me.",

            "comment": "I am really sorry for you. I can relate to your situation quite good, since my breakup was 3 years ago too and I too can't imagine being with any other person than her. \nOnly thing different for me, I got over my depression eventually and started to try live my own life. Maybe you can try and do the same, try to do stuff you like and find a way to be happy alone. It may not give you the ability to love anyone else, but I realized that I'm better off on my own and I am really happy with my life right now. It sounds a bit sad an lonely maybe, but I have my friends and that's all I need.\n\nI wish you all the best, keep holding on!",

    "postText": "2am thoughts got the worst of me so here I am making this. \n\n\nI was always considering taking the easy way out a few years ago. I don\u2019t know what or how I came out of that hole but I did. and now that i\u2019ve graduated and am finally realizing my whole life is about to change I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t.  \n\nI get the whole cliche thing of life will get better everyone has their bad days but man it sure doesn\u2019t seem like it. I do like to think I am mentally in a better space than before. but I feel i\u2019ve matured just a wee bit since those years have gone by but I still can\u2019t wrap around why I wanted to do it so bad and why I couldn\u2019t. I guess maybe it was the I have my whole life ahead of me or people will miss you. \n\nnow, since i\u2019ve last had serious thoughts about taking the easy way out, I haven\u2019t had a serious thought ab it since. and it\u2019s also been a while since i\u2019ve had these deep deep deep thoughts about all of this. so i\u2019m scrambling here realizing that what i\u2019ve done till this point in my life is completely pointless and would rather be dead. I\u2019m going to a college I do not want to go to and am going to have to do something I seriously do not want to do for another four years. \n\nif I could just get some input or just thoughts on why, it\u2019ll be fantastic",

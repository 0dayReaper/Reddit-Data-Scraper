    "postText": "\nI don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m going to write and post this on here but I just wanna get it off my chest. I\u2019m a pretty tall and muscular guy, I\u2019m also pretty social and have lots of friends. I\u2019m a student so naturally I live by myself. My mother has always been against that idea and she also hates when I talk to girls or show a little affection towards other people, she always wants to be in my life and decide everything . My father passed away when I was a kid so I don\u2019t know much about him and my mother hasn\u2019t dated anyone since. So of course I spend a lot of my holidays with her. But when I visited her during spring break she was acting really off but I didn\u2019t think much of it because she got pretty sad after my fathers death and she is still in mourning. I sat with her we talked about stuff, ate and watched movies. I went to to sleep early cause I had been driving a lot that day so I had gotten pretty tired naturally. Next thing I know is my mother sitting on top of me while I was completely naked and that\u2019s when things happened. I was so shocked that I didn\u2019t move a fucking finger or say a word it felt unreal. After her disgusting act she told me how much she loved me and that I was perfect and started praising me. After that I packed my stuff and drove crying the whole way home. I keep having nightmares about it every single day  and every time someone\u2019s touches me I remember everything, I also can\u2019t stop throwing up every time I remember something. I feel so ashamed of myself. Even my friends have noticed that I\u2019ve gotten weird lately but I haven\u2019t told anyone and I do not know what to do. I can\u2019t sleep eat or behave properly I just want this to end. I fucking hate myself for letting her do what she did. She tried calling me several times but I can\u2019t even talk to her anymore. She also sent me a message saying that it\u2019s my fault I resemble my father so much and that she wasn\u2019t in the right state of mind. I\u2019m fucking losing it.",

Many practices will work with people to make therapy affordable, you just have to ask. I was only paying a $35 copay on state insurance. You can also inquire with your local Health and Human Services office, and many walk-in clinics are able to refer you to mental health professionals in your budget \n\nBeing able to be truthful and open with someone entirely won't just \"help you get this off your chest\", it will allow you to process and make sense of what happened and what you need to move past it.\n\nI cannot say I've experienced what you have, but I do know that traumas don't go away, they fester. Anxiety can lead to largely negative habits forming, and may develop into panic disorders  Trying to fix this on one's own leads to compounding problems. Had I gone and gotten help when I was younger, I might have avoided a lot of destroyed relationships and trips to rehab from \"self-medication\".",

Being a victim can happen to anyone. Despite how much you might be telling yourself that you could have stopped or prevented this, know that it is a natural reaction to freeze or space out from the shock of the situation.\n\nAnd if people see this as a weakness, then again, it would perhaps be better such people leave your life.\n\nIf you don't want to go to therapy because you are ashamed of sharing this event with the therapist, then remember that a therapist listens to plenty of fucked up things quite often from their clients. It is, after all, their job to help people with issues, and many of those issues don't come from trifles.",

Detectives are where the work gets done in these instances. It may take time. But bring down the hammer on her. Also send the texts to EVERYONE in the family. Scorch her earth entirely.",

I believe that you should seek out a therapist so you can have someone to help you cope with what's happened. Once you're healed a little, you may also want to report her to the police (if you even want to take it that far). If not, I suggest you cut off communication with her entirely. I'm extremely sorry that you've had to go through this, and I hope that you're able to heal from this one day &lt;3",

I would recommend seeing a therapist and talk to them about it, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll trust and help you and if not, I suggest you find a better one because a therapist that doesn\u2019t believe on their own patient\u2019s words shouldn\u2019t be paid for being paid for it",

IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT! this sounds painfully hard and traumatic and I am proud of you for finding the strength to continue, YOU ARE STRONG ! your mom has something seriously messed up in her head for doing something like this, especially her own son. I am sorry you are facing this struggle especially with the passing of your father may he rest in peace. I would write her letter letting her know how you feel and after you can choose if you'd like to send it or not. that way you can truly process all that you feel and this disgusting act that happened to you. Please Remember God gives his strongest Angels the most heinous battles and keep this mind especially on your darkest nights. You will Recover, you will live, &amp; you will thrive again. After a while you can forgive her because that is true closure, forgiving another. you don't have to tell her you forgive her but in your heart you know you will or did. that too is strong, i am very proud of you King. keep your head up and keep swimming. remember progressing 1% everyday is better than degradation of 1% everyday. keep it up i am proud of you. and i know you are a stranger but i love you Dear &lt;333 remember find your strength with God and he will help free your soul, keep your faith please.",

It\u2019s not like when you were born, you chose which gene you wanted. It\u2019s her own fault for doing such a disgusting thing and not being able to control herself. Sure she wasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t in her right mind, but if she knows that then she needs to see a therapist. Not rape her kid. First thing you do is convince yourself that it\u2019s not your fault. Second, tell someone close to you that you trust, your best friend or someone you know can help you through it and you can rely on to not tell others. Next you call the police or someone like that. They might be able to get her fined or checked into a hospital because nobody in their right mind would do that to their child, she clearly needs some sort of help. This is a terrible thing and you can\u2019t keep it in. This is something that shouldn\u2019t happen to anyone. And yet again, *don\u2019t blame yourself*. This was something you didn\u2019t have any control of. It\u2019s a horrifying situation and I am so sorry. That\u2019s truly disgusting. Your mother, and you need to seek a therapist. For your mother it should be to get her in her right mind and help her fully properly grieve for her husband, for you it should be recovering from this trauma and also maybe fully going over your fathers death.",

You didn't consent. Silence doesn't mean yes.\n\nThis is your parent, parents should never see their kids this way and should especially never ever act that way toward or even around them. It doesnt matter whether you are man, if you are grown, if you are otherwise generally happy in your life... It counts no matter what. This is rape, and if your mother needs to be jailed to accept that, so be it. Go to the police if you havent already still. You deserve help and justice and validation. \n\nIm so sorry this happened to you, its not right. Consider therapy, its seems like you are pretty severely traumatized, coming from someone who has diagnosed PTSD mostly due to sexual abuse by a family member. Throwing up, nightmares, flashbacks when touched.. those are all PTSD symptoms.\n\nOfc youll figure out the legal end of it and everything in time, but my best advice is try your hardest not to forget to take extra care of your brain. Its so important. Even if youre not ready for therapy or cant afford it or whatever reason you might not go, make sure you have self care days. Days where you just be alone, maybe have a hot shower, eat your favorite food, watch your favorite shows. Its good for your brain and youll need that a lot in the healing process.\n\nAgain, I'm so sorry you experienced this. I hope your path to recovery is smooth and short, but even if its not, youll make it through, and everything will end up the way it's supposed to. Hope this helps in some way man. Stay strong, it gets better with time.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m so sorry for the loss of your father, and I\u2019m even more sorry your mother made the horrifying decision to violate you like this. \n\nYour mother, who is supposed to love and care for you, crossed one of the biggest boundaries there is.\nI would be very, VERY, angry. How could your own mother do this to you? And then try to somehow blame it on you? It\u2019s completely beyond comprehension. It\u2019s the worst form of betrayal there is. Your mother has destroyed, not only your relationship with your last remaining parent, but the way you will experience intimacy and sex going forward in life. \n\nI understand your feelings of shame, I too would be deeply ashamed of my mother and her behaviour if she violated me like this. I know it\u2019s hard - but try not to feel ashamed of yourself. You didn\u2019t do anything to cause this - and even if you somehow think you did (like by looking like your father, as your mother chose to blame it on ) - your mother would still be the one and only perpetrator. She\u2019s the one who should be carrying ALL of the shame and guilt, not you. \n\nI know some victims of rape carry shame in getting an erection or ejaculating from being abused - but that does not mean you wanted it, or that you enjoyed it. It\u2019s just the body\u2019s way of responing to that sort of touch. It\u2019s out of your control. \n\nYou say you feel like you could have stopped it. Sure. If the current you were placed into that situation again, maybe you could. But the sheer shock, and pure horror you must have experienced when waking up to what was happening to you, must have been completely debilitating. Your brain trying to compute what\u2019s going on, all of these feelings of disgust, embarrasment, violation, all at once - would put any of us into a fight/flight/freeze-mode, to escape/disassociate from the current trauma you\u2019re experiencing. Don\u2019t blame yourself for reacting this way. It\u2019s simply in our anatomy.\n\nThis is extremely traumatizing and you must feel completely exhausted. I would highly, strongly, extremely, definitely recommend you immediately seek counselling, if you haven\u2019t already, to help you through this. These feelings are too heavy to carry on your own. There\u2019s alot of great resources these days where you can talk to a therapist or psychologist remotely from home, if that would help. Most important is to try to take care of yourself as best as you can, try to eat something, sleep, exersize. Spend time with and seek support from those you trust. You don\u2019t have to tell them what\u2019s happened if you dont feel ready to, just that you\u2019re going through a tough time and need support. \n\nI understand if you don\u2019t want to report her right now, but she needs to be held accountable for what she did. Save any evidence you have of the event, like texts between the two of you, in case you want to press charges in the future.\n\nI want to end this by saying there is hope. I know you\u2019re hurting alot right now, but it can and it will get better. Be kind to yourself. Find a way to comfort yourself. Please dont blame yourself. You\u2019re the victim in this. \n\nTLDR:\n-Your mother is a despicable person who should feel very ashamed and guilty for what she has done to you.\n-You have 0 responsibility for what happened - none whatsoever. Your body went into fight/flight/freeze. How your body reacted to what your mother to you was out of your control.\n-Seek counselling/support asap. This is impossible to deal with on your own. \n-Report her when you\u2019re ready. She needs to be held accountable.",

That doesn't mean you \"let\" it happen or that it's your fault. Rape is always and only the rapist's fault. Period, dot, the end.\n\nAs others have said, if you can afford it, you should seriously consider seeing a therapist who has experience supporting men who have been raped. I understand that you feel you will not be believed, but therapists hear about this kind of thing more often than you'd think, and any decent therapist will understand that physical size and strength has nothing to do with trauma responses. You do not have to file a police report to get therapy; it is entirely your choice whether to go to the police or not. I would also recommend checking out the site [1in6.org](https://1in6.org), which is specifically dedicated to supporting men who have been raped or sexually abused. They have a 24/7 helpline chat if you are in crisis, as well as more regular online support groups.",

This shit adds trauma to trauma man, Im so fucking sorry this happened to you. Fuck her state of mind. She threw your state of mind, health, wellbeing, and your own shared GRIEF to the fucking wolves. You\u2019re not at fault in the slightest. \n\nDon\u2019t isolate yourself. This can happen to anyone. Men are taught not to hurt women even when they hurt them. Your silence and inaction WAS nonconsent. You being asleep was nonconsent. You didn\u2019t want this, and if it was entirely in your control, it would have NEVER happened. Anyone who shames you for this is toxic and you deserve people around you who understand how complicated this shit is and understands your feelings. Im sure that if you reach out to a loved one you really trust, it\u2019ll be okay. \n\nI suggest total emancipation from this woman.  No contact, for anything. She\u2019s your biological mother, but that\u2019s no mother. Mothers have a duty to protect their children, not hurt them for personal gain. Please talk to a professional. It\u2019s your choice to go to the police, but that text message could be a very key piece of evidence. Talk to someone you trust. \n\nYou\u2019re gonna be okay OP.

Block her on all social media, burn the photos you have of her, burn whatever crap she's giver you, take it out on any of her stuff that's at your flat/room rn. If you have the money and feel unsafe having her know where you live, move. Get rid of her entirely. Separate yourself from her entirely. I know it's hard. It's not easy. But tell someone. Even if it's just one person, tell them. Let them be there for you. Buy yourself your favourite food, treat yourself. If eating is hard rn, go out with your friends for lunch so they pester you into eating. If you're getting angry or upset, find a wasteyard somewhere nearby and punch and kick random stuff. If you don't want anyone touching you, say so. Tell your friends you're having a rough time and set your boundaries. Cut anyone who refuses to follow those boundaries out, because those people aren't your real friends. FOr the vomiting, get some anti nausea pills. Some pressure points keep your aga reflex in check too.\n\nIf you decide to go to court, collect all the evidence you can get. If there were security cameras, get them.\n\nMost of all, we care. And we're sorry that this happened. You can talk to any one of us about this and we'd be happy to listen to you. It's hard, but you'll get through it. Stay strong man, you're doing great :)",

If you need someone to talk to and don't want to reveal yourself, feel free to reach out here.\n\nUse the university health clinic and see if they offer mental health services. File a police report, you may not have been her first victim, but you could be her last.\n\nWe are here for you.",

Freezing up in shock during rape is a very common and understandable reaction.  Not one single thing was your fault. Please don\u2019t let this evil woman manipulate her way back into your life.  The fact that she was trying to blame it on you looking like your father is abhorrent.  Please seek therapy for your own well being, preferably one that specializes in sexual trauma. I know it doesn\u2019t seem like it, but you can be a whole person again. I am speaking from experience. I froze up as well.  Self blame is a bitch and will ruin you.  Talking about it here was the first step, you can take back your power.  My DMs are open if you need an ear. Nothing compares to good therapy with a professional though.  Sending you love",

Though I was abused mental,emotional and physically but not sexually and from personal experience your gonna wanna seek help NOW cause if not it only gets worse. I still have dark thoughts about the MF\u2019er that hurt me but I forgave him so I could move on. Now in no way am I saying forgive her or anything. Something like that takes time and even then it\u2019s best to do it for you than for their sake. \n\nSo please do it now don\u2019t let bottle it in or repress it face it and seek help at the barest of minimums otherwise it will eat away at you. It can change you and not in a good way\u2026",

This has to do with your mom and her issues surrounding your fathers death ect. She probably needs attention and affection and can\u2019t seek it out anywhere else with other men. It\u2019s sad but it\u2019s not an excuse to do this to your son. \n\nI\u2019m very very sorry again and please understand that this is not your fault at all. She is not wanting to take the blame so she gaslighted you and said it was your fault for resembling your own father. I understand what she might be going through but again, this is not acceptable at all and I feel for you. \n\nAnyways DM me if you ever need to. Seriously, I mean that. I\u2019m always here. I hope you can get help and heal form this. I also understand that you might not even want to press charges against your own mom (or you might) but that taking time to process it first might be best: And more importantly please know that anyone who would judge you for this isn\u2019t a good or cool person because it\u2019s 10000 percent not your fault. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f",

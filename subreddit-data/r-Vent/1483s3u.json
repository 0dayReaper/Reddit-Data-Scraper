If the job you want requires a college degree, you shouldn\u2019t give up and take the gap year to mentally prepare ! And for money, you can use the gap year to have a part time or full time job.",

People and my parents were always like you should have finished college etc. I felt bad for a long time, but i also started working and for just 8 months of the job which was really hard I had a team of 37 people which i looked after i was the boss of the shift. We made close to 500k a shift in products. The job was very demanding and problematic but i did that. Without education I was more than people who finished college will ever be.",

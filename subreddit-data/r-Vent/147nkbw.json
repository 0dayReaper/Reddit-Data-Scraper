    "postText": "We are still both children, she's 4 years younger.\nWe don't really like each other (it's most likely my fault, I have a really annoying sense of humor and she hates me). It has already been going on for months, she often tells me she hopes I'll die, I should kill myself and sometimes she even says she wants to kill me. She actually even took a kitchen knife on me many times. I'm afraid for my life. I don't think she will actually do it but I'm still afraid. Our parents don't care. My mom always tells me she'll stop doing it when she gets older. But it's been already months or maybe even years, I don't know but I feel like it's getting worse, I'm afraid for my life.",

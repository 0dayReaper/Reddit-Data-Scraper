    "postText": "I am a 16 year old looser. There is literally nothing special about me. Everyone around is good at something. My girlfriend is good at cooking, my friend is good at drawing, my other friend has awesome grades at school and my other friend is a starting programmer (I would say he is really good, but I am not that experienced). They all have something special about them and I am that guy without anything about me. I tried drawing, but it took me 10 hours to draw something what turned out to be ugly. I tried making some renders and they turned out very average and not worth the time I've spent on them. I tried making my own models for rendering, but I sucked at it (I know it takes time to learn modeling, but after countless tutorials and trying to make something, I still failed). I even tried making my own game, I made a pretty cool menu screen (this was the only thing I was proud about in a looong time), I downloaded some sound effects, I started planning how the game would work etc., but I quickly lost all motivation and now it sits on my computer untouched for the last year. \n\nThere are only three things that I feel like I can do:\n1. Playing video games. Yeah, games are cool, but I am not that good at them to be proud of myself (I can tell you what all items do in The Binding of Isaac and Enter The Gungeon, wow, so cool)\n2. Making others laugh. The one good thing about being so bad at everything is that I can make fun of it and make others laugh about it. However when I am not making others laugh, it's not so fun for me anymore\n3. Comforting others. Earlier I really liked helping others when they were stressed, sad etc., but after some time it gave me less and less happiness. I stopped helping my \"friends\" so much and magically my friends group got smaller. Don't get me wrong, I didn't tell them to fuck off or something like that, I just helped a little less and went from comforting them to helping them solve their problems and if they don't want to listen, then that's their problem. (After the magical and unexpected loss of my \"friends\", I went back to comforting people, because I know they are my real friends)\n\nLong story short, I just want to finally feel proud of something I can do or something I made. I would love to hear a honest \"wow, good job\" from someone, but I feel like I will never achieve that. I lack motivation to do anything. It doesn't help that my gf started going to the gym and I feel bad about my body. I even tried working out at home (I don't have any money to go to the gym), but I just can't and I don't know why. I am not fat, but I am weak and I don't like it. I just want to feel good about myself. I haven't felt like I achieved something since my first kiss with my gf and it was like a year ago. \n\nI just want to be proud of myself for once.\n\n(Just so you know, english is not my first language)",

    "postText": "I am not a \"latinx\" I am a LATINO. SAY IT RIGHT. No real latino likes to be called latinx. Latino is ALREADY GENDER NEUTRAL YOU FUCKHEADS. If you're talking specifically about a woman, then use latina. It's not disrespectful, it's not a slur. Spanish is a gendered language. Nouns have gender, adjectives have gender, using the \"male\" versions is gender neutral. When talking about a group of men and women, you use the male nouns, pronouns and adjectives. Trying to be inclusive you ended up being dumbasses. You're all about inclusion but fuck my entire language am I right?\n\nI am all about being inclusive but if you're gonna take a word from my language and culture, don't make it sound absolutely fucking ridiculous.\n\n\"Gender inclusive language\" is largely an American English thing. You'll never hear someone speak Spanish and say \"latinx\" or ANY OTHER fake gender neutral word.",

She preferred the term latinx because she believed the binary nature of gendered terms in Spanish disregarded the fact that, for many people in the queer community, gender is fluid and not as clearcut as male and female. She personally preferred to be addressed as a Latinx because, while biologically female, she identified as non-binary. Just one more perspective.\n\nEdit: words",

Likes yes technically we have words that are gendered in their suffix at the end but they don't *actually* have a gender. Take chair for example. In Spanish chairs have a female *gender* suffix, but that doesn't mean they're actually female, its just the word, we know its not *actually* gendered because of the context, that its a fucking chair. likewise context is what really places the meaning of a word, and contextually latino is a gender-neutral term. Anyone claiming otherwise is splitting hairs trying to find things to be upset about that no one, in particular, chose to upset anyone else.",

                    "comment": "Usually \"elle\". Warning though, in actual Latin American countries, most people just don't agree, at least not yet. Spanish as a language is VERY gendered and therefore it's very very hard to make up (key word: MAKE UP) \"true\" gender neutral terms. Every adjective, reference word, noun, and pronoun has gender. When talking about a male worker it's \"trabajador\", and for a female worker it's \"trabajadora\", adding a third gender neutral \"trabajadore\" is essentially taking the female (and when I say male and female I mean gramatically) word and changing the a to an e, which to a lot of us, honestly just sounds like gibberish. I commend the effort but Spanish is not a language that can easily be adjusted like english where a gender neutral pronoun already existed without needing to invent a new one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll give you an example conversation that someone might have:\n\nA: \"Lo que pasa con el es que por ser compa\u00f1ero de trabajo de Laura, siempre sabe lo que ella esta haciendo.\" (The thing with him is that by being Laura's coworker, he always knows what she's doing.)\n\nB: \"Si, escuche que ella es muy metida. Que piensas de su esposo?\" (Yeah, I heard she's kinda nosey. What do you think of her husband?)\n\nA: \"El si me cae bien. Supongo que es porque es abogado como yo\" (I like him. I guess it's because he's a lawyer like me.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let's exagerate and make everyone in this story gender neutral. The changed words will be in ALL CAPS for both languages.\n\nA: \"Lo que pasa con ELLE es que por ser COMPA\u00d1ERE de trabajo de Laura, siempre sabe lo que ELLE esta haciendo.\" (The thing with THEM is that by being Laura's COWORKER, THEY always knows what THEY'RE doing.)  \nB: \"Si, escuche que ELLE es muy METIDE. Que piensas de su (TERM DOESN'T EXIST)?\" (Yeah, I heard THEY'RE kinda NOSEY. What do you think of her PARTNER?)  \nA: \"Elle si me cae bien. Supongo que es porque es ABOGADE como yo\" (I like them. I guess it's because THEY'RE a LAWYER like me.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you might think \"oh but the English doesn't sound that bad\" and yeah, sure, it's just slightly confusing because I removed gender. However you have to keep in mind that unlike in English, all of these words are MADE UP. They're gibberish. They don't exist. It feels like making a new conjugation for something as regularly used as past tense and now having to use that. You have to make SUCH a conscious effort to actually sound gender neutral that a lot of people just don't bother. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long reply, I hope it clears it up. Also note that I'm not expressing my views on the topic, although I do think a lot of people who would identify an non-binary just don't think it's worth it because so much would change instead of just he/she-&gt;them.",

Latino is fine to be used as the gender-neutral term because that's how it is currently, but many non-binary Latin Americans prefer Latine because they don't like how the language is gendered and how masculine terms are gender-neutral rather than actual gender-neutral terms being gender-neutral. The word Latinx is kinda stupid and grammatically gross; I think we agree on that. I don't know if that made any sense, but I grew up spending a lot of time with my Puerto Rican half brother and I know a lot of queer Latines, many of whom prefer \"elle\" and \"Latine.\"",

I'll give you an example:\n\nMale: \"El esta con su amigo gracioso\"\n\nFemale: \"Ella esta con su amiga graciosa\"\n\n\"Neutral\": \"Elle esta con su amigue graciose\" &lt;- these sound as much gibberish to me and most people as \"xe / xer\" sounds in English, but then imagine that every other word.\n\nAt least in English you can go your entire day without using pronouns, in Spanish, conjugations for time and gender are so prevalent that you cannot go ONE sentence without them.",

            "comment": "Saying that \u201cLatinos\u201d is gender exclusive because the word is grammatically masculine is like saying that \u201clas personas\u201d (grammatically feminine) should become \u201clx personx\u201d. The word is grammatically feminine but it refers to a group of people of any gender. \n\nWhat\u2019s funny is that the people who use this term are mostly American-born latinos who don\u2019t speak Spanish fluently. \u201cLatinx\u201d is only used in English contexts. When speaking Spanish, the word is preceded by a gendered article \u201cla\u201d (fem) vs \u201cel\u201d (masc) depending on the form. How would you say \u201clx latinx\u201d in a sentence? What about \u201clatino people\u201d? Would it be \u201clxs personx latinx\u201d?",

Latino is inclusive to male and female, not really for the people in between the gray areas of gender. If you just fit into either male or female, the word Latinx isn\u2019t really towards you and you have every right to be mad at somebody basically misgendering you with it, because Latino would suffice as you don\u2019t fall into another gender spectrum. \n\nPersonally, as a Latino that doesn\u2019t identify as just male or female, I\u2019m not too hung up on anybody changing a language that was forced onto our people to forget our native language and culture. In a lot of cultures across the world before Spain or England took over there was more inclusive language that included not only male and female but those that weren\u2019t just male and female. All this current debate about changing the language to be more inclusive is really in a way just going back to really acknowledging EVERYBODY like how our native people did before we were all invaded by the Spanish or English.\n\nAlso out of curiosity, how the hell do they even pronounce Latinx? I\u2019ve always been confused at that lol",

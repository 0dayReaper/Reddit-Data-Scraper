    "postText": "I had a fallen out with my best friend, and I don't know what to do. I think I'm the problem. I caused this, I think. I don't know anymore. I'm a 15 year old girl in high school about to be a sophomore. My mother killed herself when I was 14 and now it been two years. During those days I lost my close aunt, my close grandpa, now my cousin got killed recently. Everything feels like it falling apart. I don't know what to do. Now my best friend even hates me. I know it was my fault all because I'm a jealous, ugly, toxic, dependent person. But this time it got worse. I send her a text because on her Instagram notes she said \"this and that person are the best\", and at that time I wasn't in the mood and said something back. That when the real argument happened. She said that she was never my best friend but she was only saying we were, because she felt bad. Then she said I was never around for her. I always helped her out on bad situation but she rather go to her \" real friends \" instead of me. So I gave her the same treatment she gave me. Then she gets mad, and then I regret. She said that her \" real friend\" was always there for her, because I wasn't and she doesn't want me around with \"her people\". I lashed off and said hurtful things like I was gonna harm myself anyways and that she wouldn't care. That when I got a realization, I think I'm toxic. Now I'm at this situation, taking \" Am I toxic\" quizzez, and now regretting my whole decision of texting her in the first place. I don't know what to do, and I need help. I don't know if I'm in the wrong, or we both are, I just need answers. To be fair last school semester I was jealous my best friend started getting closer to another person. I know that bad, but I can't help to feel that. I got over it once the second semester started, but then this new girl came in our group and started drama, this made our group fall apart, but my best friend got close with that girl. I know I'm a bad friend and I'm too sensitive (that what my best friend said), but I don't know anymore I wish I could show you the text.",

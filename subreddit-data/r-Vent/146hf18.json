    "postText": "A part of me feels bad for breaching his privacy but I feel like I deserve to know how abysmally fucked over I\u2019ve always been from the start by my parents. I don\u2019t think my mom has given a single shit about either of her two husbands and my dad is going to be pissed off and miserable over this for the rest of his life. I love being an involuntary product of a man so desperate to start a family that he married the wrong woman and a woman who thought it would be a fun activity to be a mother for a little bit before moving on. Nothing quite like being ripped back and forth by either side while both of them are acting with the thinnest veneer like their working relationship to parent me is fine and there aren\u2019t any bad feelings on either side. Very glad I can see both of their traits developing in myself and my future as their offspring is inescapable. The day I get my own independent insurance I\u2019m making an appointment for snipping myself to not have children and there\u2019s no way in hell either of them will know. I would love to adopt but sweet Christ above this gene combination can\u2019t go on. At least it gave me enough awareness to know it needs to stop. Neither of them are bad to me at all, my dad is probably the only person I can actually trust in the entire world, but he\u2019s been drinking his entire life and I\u2019m going to be his caretaker soon. It\u2019s that, leave him alone where he\u2019ll likely get into an accident and die, or put him in a god awful nursing home where he\u2019ll be miserable. An overwhelmingly large chunk of my life is going to be sacrificed taking care of his health issues or else I\u2019m a terrible person. Then when he\u2019s gone I\u2019ll walk out of all of that and find that there\u2019s nothing for me. Everyone else has been developing themselves and getting married and I\u2019ve dropped into the middle of it. Fat fucking chance I find a woman to love who will love me when I\u2019m anchored to a shithole small town and am forced to carry this shit in my mind. If I leave I can\u2019t ever forgive myself for leaving. I don\u2019t feel like I ever had a real chance from the beginning.",

While you might define the letters syntactically as \"masculine\" or \"feminine,\" you also acknowledge that the terms *are already* gender (as in, gender identity) neutral! A *monta\u00f1a* is no more a woman than a *taco* is a man! The split is completely random.\n\nNow, if I am from the Dominican Republic, and I attend a group for trans people in the US, I will probably want to be referred to as Latine. Why? Because we will be speaking English\u2014English doesn't use gendered terms outside of personal pronouns, and I don't want to be personally gendered *in English.* However, if I'm speaking Spanish, I know the O in *\"Latino\"* is not significant. The gendered ending has no weight.\n\nGood eg. If the DR wanted to enact a sexist law prohibiting women from doing something, they would not address the women as *\"dominicanas.\"* They would use the word *mujeres* (women), because THAT is the word with gendered weight.\n\nTL;DR: \"Gendered languages\" are already neutral. They are not dictating which objects or concepts have dicks or vaginas. I think \"Latine\" and \"Latinx\" are English words appropriate for establishing neutrality in English conversations, but no English speaker should force it into the Spanish language as a whole.",

Pretty sure folks without wombs would have a tough time getting pregnant \ud83d\ude02\n\nTo be honest, I don't know a ton about who decided the make gender and sexuality rules and when. All I know is folks have been lying about sleeping with the same sex for always (except in those places where it used to be normal, like Greece and Oaxaca, some parts of India, etc). This is reeeeally dull work, but there's a great free resource called Archive.com where you can access essays and primary sources (letters and proclamations and shit) that can tell you what the vibe was at a certain time in a certain place. For example, I did a history project in undergrad and found a document from a meeting between opposing sides of the American Civil War that **explicitly stated** the war was about slavery. My \"it was about states' rights\" friends were very upset \ud83d\ude05.\n\nAnyway, if you happen to be bored and wanna check it out, you might be able to find specific sources that point to who was really responsible for the rise of the binary. For what it's worth, I doubt it was all one culture's doing. \n\nI attribute most of the responsibility to Christianity, and to Dr John Money\u2014New Zealand psychologist who invented the idea of social gender.",

Second, *we have no idea if it is the XY and XX chromosomes that determine sex,* because recent discoveries indicate that every person has hundreds of other, unstudied chromosomes that also play a part!\n- The parts of the gestation process where we used to think facilitated gender is actually a mindfuck.

It's absolutely reasonable, and has parallels in many other avenues of science, like the whole \"alpha wolf\" thing has even been discredited by its own \"inventor\" (what would be the word? Anyway inventor works because it *was* invented but it's an invention of pseudoscience), and of course so many other examples, phrenology, mental health pseudoscience (not mental health science, we absolutely need that and need for it to be developed), and the whole gendering of scientific pursuit has likely set us back so much (especially since women have been developing science for who knows how long because their contributions get buried and stolen)\n\nSometimes I worry science has done more damage than anything else, and not *science* but *people* using it for their own gain, much like religion. (And of course some actual science has caused immense damage, eg the bomb. Nevertheless I know and believe science has also done more good than anything else, neither good nor bad is the point but if it doesn't do us good why should it be so important? As far as we know we're the only thing that matters and if we die or suffer then it's not in our interest.)\n\nGonna check out that series asap! \u270a",

As for the concept of transgender, that was only introduced to non-anglo cultures by the English, when they decided to colonize everyone and force a gender binary on them. Before the English arrived uninvited, most cultures had their own ideas of gender, and acknowledged many more than just \"man\" and \"woman.\" There was even one culture, recently extinct, in which one's gender role was defined by their job. People we would call men and women worked in rice fields together, and in their culture were understood to be the same thing (didn't matter what was between their pants). \n\nTL;DR, there's a big irony in our concern about inclusivity, because the reason many of these minority categories exist is because they were artificially defined and sectioned off by patriarchal imperialist cultures in order to more effectively discriminate against them.",

Yes, Spanish is a gendered language and yes, grammar gender is a totally different concept than (social) gender. Hell, it\u2019s stated on every RAE's book. It\u2019s not something hard to find. \n\nHowever, I do think it is important for us to have this discussion. It\u2019s impossible for humans to separate ourselves from languages, and is even more impossible to separate ourselves of our own native language. We are a product of our language. It\u2019s not only how we think, or how we interact, is literally what and who we are. \n\nLanguages are also always changing, and they are linked to the speaking communities of that specific language. We, Spanish speakers, are everywhere. We are in Europe, we are in South America and we are in North America too. There are a lot of Spanish native speakers communities everywhere. Why should we forget that? If the Spanish speakers in the USA wants to start talking about using \"Latinx\" instead of Latina or Latino, why should we attempt to stop it? \n\nIs \"Latine\u201d a better alternative? Yes, of course, at least in my opinion. The \"x\" makes it phonetically impossible to pronounce in Spanish. But we can\u2019t forget that at the beginning of the \"lenguaje inclusivo\", we all used \"x\" instead of \"e\". It was our first approach to the not so weird idea than the way we use the language is totally in correlation with how we are perceived and treated. Hello, linguistic discrimination, glad to see you again! \n\nAnyway, I think is nice for the Spanish speakers on North America to be participating on this specific discussion. They may even come up with interesting ideas. Let them talk, let them use whatever form they find fitting! Let\u2019s see how our language evolve! :)",

It is just how it works. - This is a problem.\n\nIf a trans person wants to be addressed as 'she/her' why would you call her as 'he/him'? So if a community wants to be represented in a particular way, why wouldn't we update these rules? Why are we just saying - 'default?' Who's checking? Languages, cultures keep updating.\n\nI don't have anything against you. I have a problem with this - 'computer says no' mindset. People should question things. Change redundant rules. And ask people - 'are you okay?' more than 'is it correct?' \n\nA lot of things are in place to help maintain order in the world. We get it. But a lot of them are stupid. Like auto-masculine words. Also, professional writing accepts 'they/them' now. Everywhere.",

How can \"gender\" be so irrelevant to who we are when it comes to our actions, but also something to be \"integral\" to our identity? IMHO people should be more proud of their accomplishments and growth as a person, instead of sex/race/etc. I'm proud of my heritage bc it got me here. But I don't think my culture is better, however I DO have a bias towards it. \n\nIt's the idea of despising labels, but then resorting to labels for yourself and those who disagree with you. \n\nPersonally, I think the idea that somebody doesn't belong in their body is a huge concern. Same way body dysmorphia is a mental illness, feeling like you don't belong in your skin, in some way removed from yourself is a mental condition. One that should be treated, some \"activists\" think \"treatment\" is hormone therapy or reassignment, but it stems from something much deeper than that. Ever wonder why people suffering from anorexia might not \"feel better\" from \"just eating,\"? It seems like a simple fix to the problem, but the issue here is merely the result of something else. Something that cannot be treated by any procedure or hormone therapy, but by actual cognitive therapy. Some legislators believe WE (as in everybody else, who does not suffer from said conditions) should pay for these treatments (gender re, hormonal th). I wonder why so little comes out of their [said lawmakers] wallet though.... \n\nThere was a study not too long ago, now since obscured regarding desistance to gender dysphoria over time. Meaning it was a temporary thing among 60-90% of those surveyed (in a separate study regarding desistance itself) would eventually get over their condition. \nThe now hard to find study was about desistance and regret. Specifically, how many of the people pushed to transition at a young age (because their mannerisms were thought of as rigidly \"feminine\") later regret the transition and identify as just gay men. \n\nMy point is: sexuality is more relevant and uncontrollable than \"gender,\" even then I don't think it's inherently impressive to identify as anything. It's impressive if you're happy with who you are after all you may have undergone \n\n\"Gender,\" is not how you feel. It's just what you are. If you feel like you don't belong in your own physical... that's going to be a toll on your mental, caused by your own brain. A mental condition. If anybody truly cares about trans people and the like, they would want actual (non invasive) treatments and therapies, as in cognitive behavioral therapy, not hormone. \n\nSide tangent, I know. Not trying to offend anybody or start any arguments just wanted to throw something out there",

To say that non-binary or other wise non- gender conforming people are ONLY yt or it\u2019s a yt thing.. is a colonized mindset.\n\nIndigenous people have had two spirit and other gender identities long before colonization.\n\nOnly since colonization has gender been so forced into 2 boxes, male or female\u2026 \n\nIt\u2019s not racist when it\u2019s made by Latine people.\n\nHopefully this is coming from a good place b almost everyone who complains about gender inclusivity in the Latine community is just transphobic/ homophobic, stuck in old ways and tries to act like anyone That\u2019s not \u201ctraditional\u201d is disrespecting the culture.\n\n\nThe thing is though, there is a huge amount of gay, trans, and other wise LGBTQIA latine folx and Cishet latine don\u2019t exclusively own the culture and aren\u2019t better than the rest of us at deciding what\u2019s ok for our community.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like it, you don\u2019t have to call yourself it.\n\nAlso a lot of these people voicing how much they hate the terms queer people use to identify within the Latine community, don\u2019t even know the difference between Latine/ Hispanic/ race/ ethnicity, or all the colonialism that is the basis for all of it.\n\nShowing up to the adult table with crayons to write their thesis.",

I know why some people feel that they should use it, but gender is an integral part of the language and tradition that doesn't demean or objectify anyone.  More than 20 countries on Earth speak Spanish as a first language.  I suspect that this expression would sound strange in almost all of them. No seas pendejx.",

So, why are we still making such an issue out of skin color?\n\nYou should not be feeling such hatred, especially from yourself. If those people are so unwilling to avoid the subject, especially if you ask them to not discuss it, then those people are not worth your time. They should respect you and your request to change the subject if it is of great sensitivity to you personally.\n\nHang in there!",

It actually baffles me that people like this still exists\u2026 like I thought we snuffed racism out in this generation already. You need to distance yourself from them, that\u2019s why you hate your skin. You shouldn\u2019t hate your skin but you\u2019re being influenced by them to. \n\nIm ngl I\u2019m white and I have used the n word. We all have. Don\u2019t let a white person tell you they\u2019ve never said it because we have said it at least once behind closed doors just to say it. So I don\u2019t think someone who isn\u2019t black is instantly racist when they say the n word (not talking abt ur friends), it depends on the context they use the n word in, but that still doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay for them to use it\u2026 it just means they\u2019re not an effed up person. Some people just don\u2019t get how offensive it is. I don\u2019t get it all myself, but I still respect y\u2019all to not say it.",

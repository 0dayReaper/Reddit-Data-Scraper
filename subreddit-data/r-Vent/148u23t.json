    "postText": "I have a lot of problems. I\u2019m always at the doctor trying to find answers and I only get treated for my symptoms and never find out the cause. I constantly see specialists and they either write me off, treat only my symptoms (against my protests) or refer me to someone else.\n\nIt\u2019s especially bad because I\u2019ve had lifelong depression. Anyone who has a mental illness knows, that doctors will pin EVERYTHING on your mental illness. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I don\u2019t even tell my providers that I have depression so they won\u2019t write me off as quickly. \n\nWorse than that is that I keep myself in decent shape. I have decent muscle, I keep up with hygiene and I keep my affairs in order. I try to tell my doctor\u2019s that I\u2019m trying REALLY hard to keep going but that the pain is very debilitating sometimes and really makes me sad. \n\nI have constant sinus pain (without pressure) I have severe GERD, I have Degenerative Disc Disease in my neck and back, I have insomnia and garbage sleep in general, I have pain in my hands, pain in my forearms, pain in my ankles, pain in my knees, pain in my jaw, pains in my chest, multiple bladder infections. I can\u2019t even list everything because I\u2019m so used to living this way.\n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t want to see doctor\u2019s. I don\u2019t want to pay them thousands of dollars, I don\u2019t want procedures, I don\u2019t want meds. I just want to be healthy. And whatever \u201cit\u201d is usually comes in waves. I\u2019ll feel good, sometimes almost normal for a few weeks and then I\u2019ll crash and be covered in ice packs and full of ibuprofen. My forearms, wrists, hands and ankles are getting so bad that they hurt whether I rest them or not.\n\nI saw my ortho the other day for my thumbs (which have progressively hurt worse over the course of a year to the point that I wear braces most of the time) and after a brief inspection he told me \u201csee your primary care, you may have Rheumatoid Arthritis.\u201d And sent me on my way. My primary care doctor checked my blood work and though my Sed rate was elevated, my ANA was negative so she thought I had Gout. Took a test and I don\u2019t. She never even called to give me my results.\n\nI\u2019m just so angry. I\u2019m not even that depressed about my condition any more I\u2019m just mad. I don\u2019t want to feel like shit and I don\u2019t want to keep paying money for these providers to brush me off. If they think I\u2019m just health obsessed, why even treat me? They\u2019re happy to take my money I guess.",

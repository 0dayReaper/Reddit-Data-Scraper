    "postText": "A few weeks ago, i was scrolling tiktok, I saw a backrooms video. There were all kinds of waterslides leading to a pool in a white room. Someone went down the spiral slide. There were tube floaties. It was just like a dream I had when I was a toddler. Except, my dream didn't involve hazmat suits. \n\nA few months ago, I had a dream that I can only recall a small bit of. A camp, the buildings. \nThis weekend, I went to a camp as staff, and it had the same layout of buildings. Same general age of buildings. \n\nNothing significant really happened. But it is kinda freaking me out. Considering Id never seen these places before, except in my dreams.",

    "postText": "Not actually recent. it was a while ago but i just got into therapy and i think i\u2019m finally processing. he\u2019s dead. i was so numb through the process, i had to deal with it all myself. three years ago i wasn\u2019t too far into adulthood, had siblings in their thirties and family galore but just me. i remember everyone flocking like birds for everyone else\u2019s death, and yeah my dad didn\u2019t want a funeral or a page in the newspaper but there\u2019s so much we could\u2019ve done, or someone could\u2019ve helped me. that\u2019s a lie, my brother came before, to much of my begging for months of me asking him to come home to see our father the months he was sick and i was alone taking care of him, and an hour after i fell to the floor screaming in a hospital, i was alone. i\u2019ve seen people who\u2019ve passed before but it was so different. in my family we usually stay still someone has passed but covid, so it wasn\u2019t an option. he was so cold and i remember waiting for him to sit up and tell me how stupid i was for crying but he didn\u2019t. my dads dead, and my family really doesn\u2019t care, and i have to walk alone. there\u2019s no one to teach me anymore.",

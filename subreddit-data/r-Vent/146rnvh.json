    "postText": "For the past two months now everytime I go out people seem to not be able to control their mouths. I'm a 21 y/o female and I know I shouldn't let this bother me, I know I should be the bigger person, but it's just so hard after years of bullying and comments that it's continued to my early adult life. I know I'm not pretty or thin but it hurts to hear. The most recent comments I've had made directly to my face plaguing my mind and robbing my happiness are; \"she looks like a man.\" followed directly by \"you look like a man.\" to my face, as well as \"wow, look how big that lady is \" said loudly in a crowded space while pointing directly at me, fully aware that I heard as I was all but three feet away from them if that. I've anxiety, so I react very strongly and quickly to everything even if I don't want to, and on top of an already low self esteem these comments really crushed my soul. It's hard for me to simply brush it off and move on. No one else seems to understand how badly these words are affecting me. I don't know why people can't just keep their mouths shut.",

I was always against this war, from day one, and now I might be called in to die for bullshit goal I never believed in.I guess this isn't really a vent, I just wanted some emotional support, I'm literally shaking and about to cry rn.  \n\n\nEdit: OMG!

Along with literally every European country today\u2026 The world and Europe today is far more diverse than back then. However Russia far less diverse than any other European countries in terms of who is in control. Besides, fascism and nationalism persist regardless of diversity. Look at the rise in nationalism in the United States that cuts through racial lines. Not to mention a bottle neck and centralization of power can still exist within a diverse state.",

I don\u2019t know what to do to help, only advice is to go along with the mobilisation, don\u2019t lead on that you are against the war, play it cool. If you have to fire a weapon, do so but purposely miss shooting a soldier so it isn\u2019t on your conscience. The other soldiers aren\u2019t going to be able to tell which direction bullets are flying. So they won\u2019t know if you are purposely avoiding Ukrainians or not. \n\nWhen you are in close range to a Ukrainian fort or front line defense area, you wait until your platoon is asleep at night, and make it like you\u2019re going for a bathroom break and don\u2019t come back. Check your compass and keep going west. You may have to be smart and hide or hike some miles into the woods and if anyone catches you, you just say you got lost and don\u2019t say a word else. Always carry a white cloth of some kind on you, in your pocket so that should you come across Ukrainian you wave it around to signify surrender and not a threat. \n\nI\u2019ll be praying for you!",

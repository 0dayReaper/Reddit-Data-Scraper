    "postText": "Put a TW just in case this is triggering. \n\nSo I talked before about quitting my job and not feeling bad about it, but now I'm stressed. No money, no job, and can't even register for classes until the fall. \n\nSo me and my friend jokingly signed up for a sug@r d@ddy website. \n\nThis guy contacts me and we'll call him Diego. Diego is almost 40, divorced with 2 kids, and live a couple hours away from me. \n\nHe seems nice, the arrangement is fine, but I'm a little weirded out that he only wants s\u20acx from me. Like seriously, that's all he wants. \n\nFrom what I've gathered from my research into Sug@r b@by/d@ddy relationships, there will almost always be s\u20acx. But there's also them just wanting to hang out like on dates or shopping trips or at their house. \n\nThis guy is adamant about the arrangement being ONLY s\u20acx.\n\nWhich leads to another problem. I'm a virgin. 100%. I only vaguely have an idea about what I do and don't like for s\u20acx. It's not a super important thing to me but it does feel weird just giving it up to some man for money. \n\nAnd wouldn't the s\u20acx only arrangement technically make me a pr0stitute? Is this illegal? \n\nI don't have any other way to make money to at least help out a little bit with my mom. And doing it with this guy would be the quickest way to make the money. But I'm a little scared. I'm overall just uncomfortable about this but I'm also willing to go through with it for a little helpful money. \n\nIt's not too late for me to back out though. Should I? Is there a better alternative? \n\nContext: I'm 19 and a lesbian",

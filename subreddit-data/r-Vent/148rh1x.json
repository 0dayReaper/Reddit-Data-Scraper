    "postText": "So I gave birth 9 days ago to a beautiful girl. Everything was going well, my c section scars are healing nicely and baby is growing fast. However, today my sister received a letter stating she needed to come in for a postpartum check up and congratulations on her new bundle of joy. She was obviously confused as her daughter is 18 months old. When she say the birthday she knew there was a mistake as it was my daughters. \nWe tried calling the job and family services for my state and got no answer. Now we have to go up there and get it figured out early in the morning. We did call the maternity ward at the hospital I gave birth at and they said there was nothing they could do because they only kept track of the mothers last name. How the hell do you only keep track of our last name??? Like they didn\u2019t even put her under my name. I have my name on the proof of birth and the birth certificate, yet they still messed up. I know eventually it\u2019ll get worked out but I can\u2019t even get my daughters insurance fixed because of this. Not to mention they didn\u2019t even put her name under her name. The put it under \u201cbaby girl (my last name).\u201d I feel defeated yet it\u2019s kinda funny. I just wanna laugh at how stupid this whole situation is but it upsets me so so much. Anyways thanks for reading and have a good day!",

    "postText": "Everything feels fucking incompetent and out of my control. My family's a crock of shit, been mentally abusing me ever since I was a kid and they encourage my mom's emotional codependency on me and tell me I'm a piece of shit for not feeling any love for her and she's got it in her head that I'm schizophrenic(I'm not, several doctors have confirmed it) and incapable of taking care of myself because I'm depressed and left my room a mess and I applied for disability benefits. I'm fucking 18 and she's deprived me of skills of how to take care of myself because she expected me to depend on her forever and be friends with her forever and sheltered me away from friends and of course I'm fucking autistic and ADHD and just say the most fucked up shit with no regard because I can't keep it inside and I lack tact and my social life is non existent. Fucking called me paranoid like my dead dad who was schizophrenic because she thinks she's never done a damn thing wrong to me. Oh I'm not an adult because I didn't wash my dishes because I always fucking felt like she was staring at me and I can't stand her being around me because I just want to yell at her to get away from me but I can't tell anyone that because then they'll tell me I'm a piece of shit for not submitting to her. It seems like no one understands what mental abuse is. I wasn't taught to drive, and she expects me to find someone we both know to teach me. Fuck her. I broke out of the house and she threw a fit and told family I'm manipulative and mentally ill and degraded my character and they agree with her I can't even reach out for help because literally all of them are against me and expect me to take care of her emotions. My entire fucking life has always been her emotions first, mine last. As long as I stay happy and complicit and watch her yell at other people and praise her I'm a good kid. I feel fucking invisible and like nothing matters. I'm goddamn homeless and only have one friend but she can't house me and I'm holed up in a motel until tomorrow because that's as much as I can afford with what petty money my mom left me from my savings. I'm so fucking fucked why is trying to be free such a fucking task? I just want to be a part of the world and I don't know how to talk to people without freaking them out with my thoughts. Fucking state can't shit, or if they can, they're not telling me. There's a million fucking services for disabled adults but all of them have waitlists and waivers and I can't even fucking get case management because that's also a fucking wait list. I fucking hate this life but I keep waking up everyday so I can't do shit but let it drag me around. Nothing feels definite. Nothing feels guaranteed. I just keep fucking ending up being fine by some miracle. I feel so fucking alone with only one friend. We don't even talk much because she's always busy. Fuck no one is going to see this anyway",

    "postText": "I was in my research class today where I've been crying and overthinking over my presentation because I didn't know if it was going to be enough or if I did it correctly. But then the presentations done after me were mediocre at best. I just realized I'm not that dumb. It's kind of sad and comforting at the same time. Sad for our education system and comforted by the fact that I can still catch up. \n\nI didn't graduate through the normal junior high school because of Financial problems, so instead I went through an alternative learning system. Unfortunately they never taught us how to do research papers or the regular teachings in Junior HS.\n\nNow that I'm studying in my senior highschool, I just realized I'm actually not that behind. If I just work harder, they wouldn't even notice that I didn't go through the same school system as my classmates..",

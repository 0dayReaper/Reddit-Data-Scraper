I get it and I told myself I wouldn\u2019t care about it after last year when I had an even worse birthday with my toxic ex screaming at me in front of everyone and refusing to meet me because I went out with my friends for my bd when he didn\u2019t plan anything for me anyway and also didn\u2019t give me any presents or even bought me a drink like thanks? \n\nAnyway so this year was an upgrade at least no one yelled at me and I\u2019m not in an unhappy relationship or any relationship to be exact idk if that\u2019s something to be grateful for. But tbh this year no one visited me, I haven\u2019t received any gifts not that I expected gifts but I always visit my family and friends, attend their extravagant celebrations at fancy restaurants at which you pay for yourself just to be there for them on their day and also get them presents, cake etc\u2026 \n\nSo I\u2019m just sad and disappointed because all I got was happy birthday texts and those didn\u2019t even come until like the evening ? Not even midnight or morning texts\u2026 like ok I get it I\u2019m not that important \ud83e\udd72",

I'll throw a big party for my husband's 30th this year and try not to be salty when my next birthday is the same.",

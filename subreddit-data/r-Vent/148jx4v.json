    "postText": "A year ago I had everything. A job that pays, a loving girlfriend that I wanted to marry, a best friend who I would die for and I even rekindled a relationship with my family. I quit my job and made plans to move back with my family to help them build a house. This means I would have to leave where my gf lived. Boom, lost her due to her not wanting to do long distance. A fall out happens between me and my best friend, lost her also. An argument spoils the relationship I have with my family. It's only been a year. I feel like I've lost every sentimental connection I had. I dont have any friends and I'm a prude I dont like a lot of people. I feel like I'm going crazy. I'm starting to hate everything I see on the internet also. Everything meme wise or political wise is all just seeming so tiresome. I dont know where to meet new people. I'm a shut in and I dont speak the language of the country I'm in, I dont like playing charades either. I cant do dating apps, neuron activates with a hair trigger, if not now definitely later. I still think about my ex, I obsess over her still, I'm shameless about it. There really was nobody like her and I miss you so much. What kills me is if she felt the same she would let me know, but it's been a year I am still romanticizing her like a loser. I am clearly at some sort of small crisis. I am sad and I am going crazy. But dont start thinking I going to ever resort to manually turning this off and expediting my funeral. Never. Craziness is what makes life exciting but I hate being alone.",

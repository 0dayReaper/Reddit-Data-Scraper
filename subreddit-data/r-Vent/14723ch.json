    "postText": "I feel awful saying this, but it\u2019s true. \n\nI don\u2019t have a good relationship with my dad. \n\nEarlier today, my mom was going through her closet and looking for stuff to donate. She saw a blouse that she thought I would like, so she gave it to me. I kept it on the back of my door, and my dad saw it. I explained that my mom had given it to me, and he told me \u201cjust don\u2019t show off too much\u201d. He was referring to the \u201cv neck\u201d, which wasn\u2019t a v neck at all. \n\nHe constantly wants my sister and I to clean up after him. If we have takeout or something and one of us gets up, he grabs his plate and holds it up so we\u2019ll take it from him. He constantly asks us to clean the kitchen or empty the dishwasher when he barely does it himself. \n\nHe almost constantly makes comments about how much I eat. Sometimes I\u2019ll get five chicken strips from a restaurant, and he\u2019ll say \u201ccan you really eat all that?\u201d One time during dinner, he called me fat as a \u201cjoke\u201d, and was confused when I started to cry.",

            "comment": "That is absolutely awful. Shame on him, he is a grown ass man. He shouldn\u2019t be commenting on your body. Also a v-neck is not showing too much it isn\u2019t like you are outside naked. Some people just need to open their eyes to their own stupidity. It is also weird ass hell to sexualize your child like that. I do not know him but that is giving me icky vibes. No one should make comments like that to their kid or anyone\u2019s kids. Like that is extremely icky. \nAnd eat the chicken strips. It is your body, listen to what it wants. I hate that you feel guilty for that. You are perfect the way you are even if you don\u2019t look like others. Even if you do look like others your body is perfect. I know you probably wont believe that but i hope one day you do.",

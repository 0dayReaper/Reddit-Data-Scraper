    "postText": "My dad died sometime between last Wednesday and yesterday. We're not sure when because nobody had heard from him in that time and he was found at his house yesterday. We don't even know how he died. It was sudden an unexpected. I feel like I'm falling apart and I just don't know how to handle all of this so I'm here. He's in Florida and I'm in California so I havent seen him in about a year and that is tearing me apart. Haven't even talked to him in about a week. All I want is to be able to call him but I can't. It just sucks.",

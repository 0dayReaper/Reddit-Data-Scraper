When the work gets to hard/I don't understand it I try to explain to people that I don't understand what it's saying to me and they say \"just read it\" and when I read it I still don't understand WHY DONT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT I DONT UNDERSTAND??? and when I start to have a meltdown and say things I can't control they blame me and get mad and disappointed LIKE I'M SORRY THAT YOURE DUMBASSES CANT UNDERSTAND! and people stare at me and look at me with disgust and embarrassment and I'm always so humiliated for something I can't control to the point I just start running out of the class room and try to hide they just follow me and make it worse one time it got so bad to the point I assaulted a teacher or one time I got sent home my dad doesn't understand that I'm scared and I just basically can't go to school I'm too scared and the worst thing is I'm in A LITERAL ED PROGRAM!! SO THESE SO CALLED \"PROFESSIONALS\" ARE GETTING MAD AT A CHILD WITH A DISABILITY FOR ACTING OUT OF FEAR!!! like fuck man.. I can't control what I say or do.. I hate school.",

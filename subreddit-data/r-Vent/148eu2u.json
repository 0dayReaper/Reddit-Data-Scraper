    "postText": "All I want so badly is to have a relationship and a family. I feel like I\u2019ve poured all my extra time and energy into dating since my last long term relationship ended and still I\u2019m single. I was seeing someone the past three months and when I brought up being an official couple it pretty much caused him to end things with me. I saw a lot of potential with this guy so it hurts. I don\u2019t understand, I\u2019m attractive and so loving. I told myself I\u2019d take a break from dating but I already feel tempted to go back on dating sites. As much as I want to take this time to work on myself I feel like having a partner would add so much to my life and is really the most important thing to me. I\u2019m almost 30 so I\u2019m beginning to panic and feel like I\u2019m running out of time.",

There's plenty of time to find your partner. Just stop trying so hard and let it happen. The only people you're likely to find on the dating sites are casual hookups and hookers. Nothing solid.",

    "postText": "I understand on what I did to deserve the suspension but not understanding why it is that long. For context I heard that one of my childhood friends was being bullied by 2 kids my age I got so angry when I heard the news I went to kid 1 who was at the canteen and told him \"you can either go with me and talk to my parents and victims parents about what you did or I'll bring you there by force\" he told me \"yeah I'll go with you\" but he was taking ALL the time in the world in the canteen I can see him standing still and not wanting to move hoping I would cool down but I got angry again and dragged him across the school to talk it out with my parents but one of kid 1's friends screamed at me \"you wanna fight!?\" And that just made me snap and I went to him tried to scream at him and shake him but he had me in a choke hold so I countered his choke hold and threw him on the floor and proceeded to run to the car and cry.. the school has diagnosed me with ADHD from my behavior and from what my parents told me they call me a demon (my school is a private Catholic school) they also covered up the bullying and put everything on me and mind you this is my 2nd incident now I go to therapy and I'm changing in hopes the school would let me join the prom.. as of now I'm wayy more insecure than I used to be and I tend to cry a bit more often than I usually would I lost my courage to stand up for myself and gave up I have a girlfriend who is joining the prom but is forced to be partnered with my class mayor making me even more paranoid I know I should trust my class mayor since he is one of my best buds and my girlfriend for over a few months but... I can't help the feeling of insecurity and paranoia hitting in the head...",

They will point you in the direction of a psychiatrist and the rest will be history. The problems you\u2019re having are VERY common. Many many people feel like you do right now and there are hundreds of medications that are non addictive and non intrusive to your life that will totally straighten you out so you can function again. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t think it will work, just give it a shot. You\u2019ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain",

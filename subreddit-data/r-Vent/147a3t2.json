    "postText": "Hi ,Im writing this bcs I need to pour somewhere and I don't have friends that I trust enough to do that .I don't think I will ever have them .Anyways the whole day when i was studiying I was also touching some long hair on my jaw beside my ears that was bothering me .I was seriously r\nThinking of removing them .In the evening ,my mother happened to notice them and proposed to help me remove them .I said that I would do it if its going to be painless and she answered that I didn't have to worry .She removed them hairs with a rasor and it was already ugly to me .She said that It was just bcs I wasn't used to it ,but I could see that it was also badly done but I thought hey lets trust the process .And then she took 100$ lazer machine put it on my face and I closed my eyes bcs I trusted her and then she pressed the button and I was surprised to feel some pain I smelled that something was burning .I got anxious .and I told her to stop everything it was hurting me to the point I wantec to cry and I actually wanted to cry evwn b4 cuz I didn't like how it looked.\nI know damn well ,I can even swear that I am able to hold those tears that I regret freeing so much at that moment .I thought for a moment \"I can cry ,she's my mother \"All that tough shit not crying in front of anybody cuz crying is for the weak was over.right? .So I let them tears flow.and then she talked to me  as if she knew me like the palm of her hand ...\nShe said \"I know you don't like this situation\" I assume she thought I had a problem with my feminity but cuz she always bring it uo  and then added \"You're braver than this ,you're crying bcs ur on ur period\" for some reason this sentence angered me .I don't know why but sexism is having such a major impact in my life .At times ,I feel worthless and since many of my hobbies are considered masculine .Often I question myself weither I really like them or am I so good at  acting that  even I can't realize that I am lying to myself .And that sentence ,I felt it unvalidated all of my feelings all of my pain and I told her ,that's what men usually say and she answered \"yeah but Im a woman\" and to my surprise she put the machine at its maximum which made me panic even more on the instructions it clearly said that you should start at the lowest level and then gradually use more power .THATS WHAT A PROFESSIONAL SAID and she ignored that as if she knows everything as if she created that thing .that red light scared me so bad they said wear glasses for a reason and I could see that light as if it was directly directed at my eyes and I was scared  it would cause internal damage .When it was over I headed far away at the other side of the bed when my mother was demonstrating and I was there with my eyes unprotected .I know damn well \"past me\" would have headed outside of that room immediately but I thought I would like to sort out my feelings ,to f*ck!ng communicate and I have a problem saying them loudly so maybe i didnt express myself correctly but I remember saying that it it hurted ,it scared me ,and that I didn't like the fact that she said I was crying bcs I was on my period ,oh look at me crying again but thinking about again its so cringe why does such a sentence upset me so much ...and the worst thing in  of all that is her saying \"I am already under enough pressure\" which clearly means don't burden me with your emotions and I was just shocked as in \"the woman was too stunned to speak\"and she walked away .\nThe best part in this situation is me regretting that I cried in front t of her and then saying \"what was done is done might as well do it correctly\" and I cried the way I wanted to cry everytime I cried silently in my room for whatever reason the way I cannot cry bcs I do not like crying in front of other people I do not like to show weakness .Human beings are weak ,so I allow myself this mercy of getting sadness out of my eyes but it was never as satisfying as crying in a way you can hear your voice,in a way  you can scream ,in a way you can cry with your whole body .Im looking forward to moving out just to do this ...Dramatic crying  .Mid crying I started laughing bcs why the hell was I being dramatic for something so ridiculous but it still hurted as much as I was being dramatic.\nMoral of this situation lets not cry in front of mother again and lets not tell her when Is my period again.",

    "postText": "I saw photos from 2 years ago of myself. And this stare. It feels so empty, yet heavy and so dedicated towards becoming a living perfection, or at least how I viewed perfection back then. \n\nI feel like total crap, I look like total crap. I just really hate the way I let myself become this. My brain just blocks all the negative thoughts, but I know that deep down, there's an immense hatred and anger towards myself. And if I'd let it go out, I would definitely do something to myself. \n\nI wish there was a time loop and I'd have stayed back in 2021, and not waste 2 years of my life on total bullshit and an illusion of doing something. Thanks for listening.",

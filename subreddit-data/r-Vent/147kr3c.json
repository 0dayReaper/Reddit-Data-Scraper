    "postText": "sorry for typos im sobbing. im fat woo-hoo what an accomplishment.  I can't leave my apartment without getting myself fun of it feels like, and I rarely leave anyways because I work from home\n\nI went to See Avatar 2 with a friend kn a weeknight really Kate, we were the only people I'm there..mthen a group of teens comes in and sits behind us and makes fun of me the entire movie. Avatar 2 is a very long movie. I was so afraid to move because I thought itbwould just make it worse. I should have gotten up and told an employee, but I didn't because what if they just gave the group a warning and then they acted even worse? Then when we left I had to walk past 2 members of the group and they burst into laughter as soon as I walked by.\n\ntoday I went to the grocery store and it was fine up until the very end when a hroup of kids where in the line next to us and is wear I heard one of them make a comment about my outfit nd they were snickering the whole fucking time. Then we leave and as om driving put of the parking lot, of course. of fucking COURSE, they're on their bikes and I drive past them and I hear one of them exclaim how fucking fat I am.\n\n\nYears ago I was driving in the city after visiting a friend, a car behind me started honking furiously and swearving thriugh traffic to get in the lane next to me and catch me at a light. I was really anxious and they all rolled down their windows (the car was  an suv full of men and women) and they all started pointing at me and laughing and saying damn she huge damn she big as hell.\n\nWow what a confidence booster awesome, very cool. I am punished every time I leave my home by being made fun of,I just never want to go outside because I can't fucking handle it man. my self esteem does not exist, I promise you that it's not low, it straight up does not exist at all. I must be a hideous disgusting repugnant monster for these people to think it's okay to talk to me this way and treat me this way.Im a worthless nothing, a disgusting fat freak. Being fat just automatically means you aren't a person, and people can treat you however they want. \n\nI hate that I always freeze up in these situations. I'm a fucking adult so why can't I act like it and stand up for myself. I want to ********* myself fucking honestly, these comments just remind me that I'm a fat stain on the planet and I don't deserve love kindness or respect.Im just a disgusting street rat to everybody and a large (literally) inconvenience. It doesn't matter how hard I try to dress nicely and how hard I try to act polite and nice and respectable in public. they can peel that facade away and see me for what I am. which is an insecure fat little insect that will let anybody do whatever they want to it.\n\n\nI hate that the only way I will ever be treated Even remotely like a human being is if I lose a shit ton of weight ,otherwise I'm just a blob that deserves to be put down, euthanized, removed from view as to not offend. I just want to *****.i want to fucjing die. Why couldn't I have gotten fucking anorexia id still be unhealthy but at least people would leave me alone. No I had to had to be a fat binge eater instead and I hate myself. I hate myself more than these strangers could ever hate me, everything they say to me isn't even on par with what I say about myself but it still hurts all the same.\n\nI'm just begging God to please ****** me and make this end. please fucking end my miserable life because clearly I'm too disgusting to be allowed around people. I don't deserve tk be in public and to live even half a normal life. It's a cruel joke to allow me to live and suffer. other than my small group of friends, nobody sees me as a person they just see a freak to ridicule and revile.  Jesus fuck I hate myself, I didn't think I could hate myself anymore but some stupid kids manage to whiddle me down even lower than I thought possible",

There is a reason you overeat, and you\u2019re going to have to deal with it before any attempt to lose weight long-term will work. Don\u2019t base your entire self-esteem on your weight, that\u2019s just one part of who you are. People who make fun of or humiliate strangers in public deserve to be caned Singapore style.",

I try to engage in my hobbies but I usually just end up eating while doing my hobby, self control is something I need to get better with.\n\n It's so hard to tie my value into anything but my weight, because that's how I was raised. I really hope I can move past that some day because I would love to be one of those people who isn't affected by outside perceptions and I wish I could praise myself for my accomplishments instead of brushing them aside and focusing on my gut.\n\nAlso, I  agree with the cane punishment!",

If I saw anybody else like me in public I wouldn't even bat an eye, but for me specifically my weight is just gross and shocking that I've let it get this bad. I remember in highschool my doctor gasping that I was 220lbs; but now I pine for those days.",

That was until I realized that Christianity and the Bible are far more oppressive and abusive than most other things in this country.

Liberty under law extends to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue, and it cannot be restricted except for a proper governmental objective.\n\nThis broad interpretation of the due process clause has been the basis for declaring not just anti abortion laws, but segregation laws, and laws restricting gay and interracial marriage to be unconstitutional. This was, in part, a direct result of the 1948 decision in Shelly v Kraemer\n\n&gt; The historical context in which the Fourteenth Amendment became a part of the Constitution should not be forgotten. Whatever else the framers sought to achieve, it is clear that the matter of primary concern was the establishment of equality in the enjoyment of basic civil and political rights and the preservation of those rights from discriminatory action on the part of the States\n\nWhat the supreme court did in Roe v Wade this week is not the over turning of a single decision, it is the reversal of the basis of *dozens* of decisions going back at least 100 years and spanning everything from racial discrimination to the right to medical privacy.",

Nor do they fight for their rights. They do nothing for children in foster care. They do nothing for single mothers. They do not help the mentally I\u2019ll and rape kits were backlogged. This isn\u2019t a solution. This is its own issue. They left a lot of people without options and because of this, some people will die and more children will be in danger. Why don\u2019t we help those around us? Why do we care so little for women and children? How can you do this and then say you care for lives? I\u2019m not going to lie, I am prolife, I would prefer people didn\u2019t get abortions, and I am a Christian (I know many people will hate this both Christian for my thoughts and non).  I am a woman and I do understand what it\u2019s like to be a single mother with no help, but I also know what it\u2019s like to be raped\u2026 or feel helpless. I also know that a lot of people turn their backs on people when they need help and do not seem to care for children when they claim to. If you claim to be a Christian, but do not have love for others and do not serve people, you are not truly what God wanted. You lack compassion. \nYou can argue all you want about people needing to be more responsible or rapes being a small portion of abortion and yes some people do have abortions like birth control\u2026 but if you do not want to fix the issues that go along with this, you\u2019re a hypocrite.

I\u2019ve had a long held belief that the solve for the issues in our political system is more power to the states (to introduce the same checks and balances that guide a corporation).   Whether it\u2019s abortion or anything else, the more power to the states the better.  I don\u2019t think this public reaction will last long.  Abortions are I\u2019d guess generally rare, and women will still be able to get an abortion.  People also seem to think this is a republican thing.  This is probably bad for the Republican Party.   You can see how the dems are using it to mobilize their base, and even though abortions have not been made illegal, the DNC has convinced their base it has, which although untrue will sway voters",

Secondly, some states will likely put verbiage into the laws making it a crime to travel to another state to get an abortion. I believe some states have already discussed this option.\n\nLastly, think about the repercussions of this decision re: states\u2019 rights. What happens when they go after gay marriage and return that to the states? I\u2019m forcibly divorced in my state unless I can afford to move? I\u2019m married in one state and single in another? How does that affect healthcare/insurance when traveling? How does that affect state vs. federal taxes? The list of problems goes on. And this isn\u2019t fair to people who can\u2019t afford to move to a different state.\n\nETA: Abortions will be illegal in many republican states within the month.",

There is also no issue regarding health care / insurance going out of state, and tax implications for out of state health care??  There is nothing.  There is also no law against banning interstate travel for an abortion.  And then going after gay marriage or contraception..  there is no connection to this current ruling and those things being taken away.   Whether you agree a fetus is a life or not, laws against abortion are to protect life, contraception or gay marriage doesn\u2019t harm a fetus.  Youre including speculative paranoia about unrelated freedoms being taken away, as an argument to the unfairness of this ruling.  I hear what you\u2019re saying, but it literally is not as bad as you think.  The dems are gassing you up in hopes of staying in control, that\u2019s it.  They are using this and filling you with nonsense to make sure you stay asleep, uninformed,  and vote for them.",

            "comment": "Hang on a second. I\u2019d like to try and explain this because I think it would help you feel less angry.\n\nThe US has a federalist government. The constitution is meant to outline the purpose of the federal government, and then everything not included in that falls to the discretion of the states.\n\nEvery state has democratically elected representatives, and they are the ones that determine the laws of the state.\n\nIf you go see a doctor, that doctor is licensed by the state you live in. If you kill someone, it\u2019s the state police that will come after you. If you want to open a business, you have to register with your state. These are all issues dealt with by the state, not the federal government. Like the issue of abortion, these topics are not mentioned in the federal constitution.\n\nIn the case of Roe v Wade, the federal government wrongly injected itself into state affairs and forced states to allow abortion everywhere, despite it not being in the constitution. It was a blatantly unconstitutional call, regardless of what the Supreme Court decreed.\n\nBecause of that, it has been repealed. That is a correct and good thing based on how our government is supposed to work.\n\nIt does not mean that \u201cwomen don\u2019t have rights\u201d. It does not mean that abortion is now illegal everywhere. It does not mean that we can\u2019t have a constitutional amendment that requires states to accept abortion.\n\nAll it means is that the federal government will no longer unconstitutionally impose its will over that of a state. It\u2019s democracy; the people of each state get to decide what\u2019s allowed or not.\n\nAbortion will continue if people want it to continue. If your state doesn\u2019t allow it, you still have the freedom to travel to a state that does.\n\nPlus, its a LOT easier to change laws at the state level than at the federal government.",

                    "comment": "Accidents can happen. Your comment just shows how incredibly dense you are. Sex workers can unwillingly get pregnant. Some people have sex and accidentally get pregnant it happens. \nAbortion is a human right and no one especially non women should comment on the choice of someone else\u2019s body. \nSome people have financial issues. A child is not cheap and not just a toy. If they are aware that they won\u2019t be a good parent and can\u2019t take care of the child then abortion is their best option. \nAlso you do realize that just using 'rubber' wouldn\u2019t do the job right?\nThe school system doesn\u2019t properly educate us especially when it comes to sex education. We learn some basics and that\u2019s it. That\u2019s where the issue already begins. \nYes of course using protection are one of the first steps to prevent pregnancy but as mentioned it might be a result from lack of education. \nProtection is also not free. This capitalistic society makes living the most difficult task when it could have been so simple. \nEspecially in America you have to pay for every little thing. So how do you expect people to buy condoms? \nMedical things as such should be free. So to answer your question: no it\u2019s not as simple as you think to just take a rubber, of course unless swines like you pay it right? \n\nAlso how come people desperately want to save an undeveloped unborn baby, which doesn\u2019t have any consciousness because it\u2019s merely just cells, instead of the birthgiver whose actual life depends on this pregnancy and unborn child?\n\nIf there are no legal options for abortion, it definitely won\u2019t prevent birthgivers from aborting and getting rid of the child. They will go for harmful and illegal options such as pushing themselves down the stairs or punching their stomach. \nThose illegal options HARM the ALIVE person WITH a consciousness.\nWhy not think about those who are alive instead of unborn clump of cells? \nYou guys do not care about the developing baby cells. You want control once again over womens bodies. \n\nOkay let\u2019s say you actually care for the unborns child life. The child was born even though their parents wanted to abort them. \nIn this case the parent was not prepared for a child, lives in poverty and is addicted to alcohol or drugs. \nNow looking at this situation how do you think is the child going to feel? \nThe parent clearly didn\u2019t want the child so do you actually think that they will take care of them and make their child feel loved? No. \nThey knew they weren\u2019t able to give up their life to such commitment so they wanted to go for an abortion. But since some brainless pro-lifers as you made it unavailable for them to access a legal abortion, they couldn\u2019t go for it. \nSo as we can see in this example this child is neglected and probably being abused since their parent is an alcoholic. Their parent already wanted to do them a favor by aborting them. \n\nIf the child ends up in the foster care system do you still think they will be happy? Still no. \nThe foster care system is messed up and would completely ruin the child. \n\nImagine the parent know that they will bear a disabled child. Would you still want the child to live a difficult life? Think about the consequences. \nIf the child would be born, they are in need of special medical needs. Their life will never be simple. Society will reject them for being 'different'. \nSo tell me you as a pro-lifer, do you still care about that child\u2019s life? \nI would rather abort the child so I can prevent it from suffering such a horrifying life. You wouldn\u2019t want your child to suffer everyday in pain either right?\n\nA fetus is neither legally nor scientifically a person or a human so abortion CANNOT be equalled to murder. That should be common sense though, excluding pro-lifers who lack brain cells to comprehend this. \n\nIllegalisation of Abortion also shows the classism in our society. \nThe rich could just go to many different locations to abort their child. But the poor? They have to rely on unsafe practices to get rid of the fetus.\n\nThe access on different abortion methods is a human right you\u2019re taking away from people.",

We can't just walk out of it when things get too hard, just take a break, unzip, walk right out. I don't think these people understand that even if they think it's wrong, it's not their choice to make!!! It's as if women were to enforce a law that vasectomies shouldn't be allowed. Then there would be an uproar, because it would be \"unfair and cruel and blah blah blah.\" But that would be important to them, because they're poor fragile men. I hate people who try to take rights away from women but would get their panties in a bunch if it was taking a right away from a man. \n\nAs for my opinion on pregnancy/sex/abortions, no, I don't think it's murder, or that women shouldn't be able to choose what to do. I just think that if women have full access to all of these things to PREVENT pregnancy, it's more or less inhumane to have unprotected intercourse and then get an abortion. Obviously, women who don't have access to such devices, can't afford them, or have been sexually assaulted are a different story. Please feel free to ask me questions, though.",

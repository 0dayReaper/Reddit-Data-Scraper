Calm out\n\nI can\u2019t fucking stop this, I\u2019ll be fine one moment then the next almost no matter what I look at I\u2019ll risk having a longing to go die. Throwaway account I don\u2019t want anyone knowing, sadly I can\u2019t because account ages, I\u2019ll just scrap this. Some days I\u2019ll be fine, some days I\u2019ll have few thoughts and wonder why I\u2019d ever do such, other days - I admit it, I\u2019ll straight up sit there and bawl my eyes out, it\u2019s always roaming in my head, the pros, cons, how, when, where on dying, lots of pros, the con of I just turned 15, how is by firearm or ulnar arterial slit, when ??, where is my room.\n\nI have the notes but not the balls. I just fucking can\u2019t anymore, it\u2019s getting to me more and more and I don\u2019t know what to fucking do.",

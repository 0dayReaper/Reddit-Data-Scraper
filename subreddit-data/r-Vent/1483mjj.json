I wonder if there's a word for this condition because it definitely isn't normal (I think)... maybe it's a trauma response?

(For me, smoking was a deal breaker this time around.  Dealt with it before.  Constant aggravation. Nope.) Consider doing that before going to the social worker/therapist.\n\nBest wishes.

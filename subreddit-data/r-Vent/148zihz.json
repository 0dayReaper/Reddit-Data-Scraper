He doesn't know where he is or what's expected.  And y'all acting confused that he's running back to me everytime you try to make him go out.\n\nI know you mean well;  but you're freaking him out.  And you're messing up his routine for when we go back home and he doesn't have 2 people desperately trying to make him play multiple times a day.\n\nNext time I'm drawing hard boundaries.",

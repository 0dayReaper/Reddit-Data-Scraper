I mean I have to but man shit is really looking bad.\n\nI\u2019m really tired of having to take care of my sister, yess I know she\u2019s sick and all but I kinda miss being the youngest sibling. I have to take care of everything: cooking, cleaning, chores and making sure she\u2019s feeling okay; like it\u2019s starting to take quite a bit of time away.\nAnd I do it regardless, because I love her and because mom can\u2019t take care of these things on top of her job, but I just wish my sister would collaborate a bit more.\n\nAlso dad just lost a bunch of money, I don\u2019t wanna get into detail, let\u2019s just say he was forced to pay for a lot of things very quickly.\nLike I know we can recover, but honestly luck isn\u2019t really on our side lately.\n\nAnd there is the whole \u201cfinding an internship\u201d thing that I have to do for college and ngl it\u2019s freaking me out. I honestly don\u2019t think I have what it takes to get into a good company.\n\nBut despite all of this, my biggest problem is that I feel very very lonely. I can\u2019t really vent to any of my family members, they have their own shit and I\u2019m kinda the \u201cemotional support\u201d to everyone else.\nAnd my friends, well, they don\u2019t really make me feel comfortable anymore.\n\nI feel like I don\u2019t really have anyone who has an interest in me anymore. Most people just want something out of me.\nAnd then there is the whole \u201cromance\u201d thing. I\u2019ve already recovered from my ex, but I honestly don\u2019t know where to start meeting new people. Tinder is absolutely bullshit (already tried) and none of my friends know any gay guys that I\u2019ll like (I\u2019m honestly tired of the childish flamboyant twink).\n\nIdk I guess I\u2019ll find a way foreward somehow, I always do. I\u2019ll survive.",

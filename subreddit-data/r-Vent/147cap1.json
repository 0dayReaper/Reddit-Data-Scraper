    "postText": "I get it. I\u2019m quiet and kind and go out of my way to make other people happy and comfortable, even if it\u2019s an inconvenience or even sometimes harmful to myself. And the more I give, the more people believe they\u2019re entitled to take. Maybe that\u2019s a part of why I\u2019ve been r***d and assaulted so much in the past, I dunno. I saw myself as less than human so maybe other people did too. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s also why other people took for granted when I wanted to do so much for them and love them so hard. Or maybe they didn\u2019t think they deserved that kind of love? I don\u2019t know, but the end result always left me in pain and feeling discarded. And left me thinking even less of myself than I started out with, which wasn\u2019t ever much.\n\nBut today I finally chose me. You kept asking and asking and ASKING me to come have sex with you even though I told you so many times no. I told you I was sick, I told you I felt bad more than just physically too and you didn\u2019t give a shit about me. I told you I was dealing with something. And still you didn\u2019t even care about me as a human being\u2014you just saw me as a toy for your own needs and wants that wasn\u2019t functioning when you wanted or how you wanted. You didn\u2019t care about how I felt, you didn\u2019t care about the human part of me at all. You just got mad at me when I tried to explain that part. That I\u2019m human and I\u2019m hurting and I can\u2019t be there the way you want without hurting myself for it. You tried to convince me it shouldn\u2019t even matter since it was supposed to be a casual thing\u2014casual or not I\u2019m still a fucking living person. I didn\u2019t expect to get married but SHIT I expected you to give me some basic human understanding and empathy.\n\nI don\u2019t like to fight. At first you made me cry. Again I felt worthless until I realized I finally fucking fought for MYSELF AS A HUMAN. And I won. \n\nFuck you.",

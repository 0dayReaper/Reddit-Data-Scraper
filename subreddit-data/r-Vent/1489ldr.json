    "postText": "Im really butt hurt. me 21 m my ex 20 f broke up about a month ago. she cheated on me twice in the span of two years, yet i cant stop getting in contact with her. the other day i texted her on discord (i have her blocked on everything else and she has discord to keep in touch) we ended up talking and i kind of got heated and told her how mad i am at her. i did nothing but treat her with respect, love and kindness yet she threw me away, fucked two other guys, then as soon as i broke up with her, she kept trying to get me back, telling me she's in love with me, yadda yadda yadda. anyways we ended up doing some e sex i guess, afterwards she was asking me if i still love her, i told her no, and she cried, she felt ashamed of the things we did that night over the phone, and i told her 3 times that i didn't want it but i thought it would make her feel better. she's always struggled with her body and looks so i do anything to make her feel happy with herself. i cant get her out of my head, i try and have some late night \"alone time\" to myself and \"videos\" but even when i watch them i get jealous, thinking about another guy entering her, pleasuring her, something i couldn't do with my own. now im sitting her, trying to distract myself with other girls, but i feel nothing towards them, does that mean im still stuck on her, or does that mean im broken? i just really need someone to genuinly care about me and my feelings, genuinly ask me if im okay, without me having to say im not okay abruptly. i struglling with a nictotine habit, and ive lost my entire bank balance to gambling addiction, im overweight but i have lost 80 pounds in about a year. i used to be scared of the dark, thinking something would kill me and now i hope it does. thank you for coming to my ted talk",

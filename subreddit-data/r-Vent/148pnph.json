    "postText": "they recently just got an 8 week old kitten. and i absolutely LOVE cats, i have one of my own. so i had no problem taking him in for a few hours, my friend's apartment complex doesnt know about their new kitten and maintenance said they would show up at their place today. they needed a place for him to go when they were at work. \n\nive taken care of 5 newborn kittens before, so i figured this wouldnt be too bad. but i think this kitten is sick or something. he CONSTANTLY wants to be held and cuddled. he cries every time i stop touching him. i was told he was litter trained but he's obviously fucking not. he was in my lap earlier and he shat liquid all over my shirt and sweatpants.\n\ni changed my clothes, accidents happen. but then he shit on me AGAIN. i just stopped holding him altogether and i laid a towel out for him to sleep on next to his litter box. he shit all over my towel too.\n\ni just couldn't imagine 1) not letting my apartment know that i have a new pet, 2) not bringing my cat to the vet when it's obviously sick, and 3) willingly let someone else babysit and lying to them, knowing damn well your cat isnt litter trained.",

    "postText": "No matter how much I try, I always feel like a burden to those I love. I always end up relying on others and don't feel i can ever replay them.\n\nMy family has never been rich but we have always made it work,   so I decided to join the military so I could save up for college and have back up skills as well as send money home. \nDuring basic training I rolled my ankle in a pot hole during a march, being basic they want to make sure that you will keep going when they ask so they put me in a tensor boot in the military boot. This caused my swelling to go in not out, the injury also affected the muscle so It kept giving out causing several cuncussions, this also caused my nerves to be damaged and resulted Complex Regional Pain syndrome (which showed up after feeling in my foot returned). Basically my nerves are always screaming like I have knives going in them or I am stepping on glass and presure makes it worse. \nAnyway by the time I got home my foot was grey, blue and orange (the doctor had never seen orange), for the first few months I couldn't put weight on it or feel anything. As the 2nd month hit being out of the military we found out 1st they didn't discharge me medically and 2nd I should be better by now and they weren't paying for any more therapy. My parents paid for years of therapy as we fought to be changed to a medical discharge, the feeling came back but it was a living hell. (I have been on crutches and canes since the injury at this point) I married my first husband we are just going to say that was an abusive relationship and I didn't realize until the birth of my daughter and once she was in the line of fire my parents took me in, I tried to do therapy etc with my ex so I could tell my daughter I tried everything it didn't work. I gave my parents the little savings I had trying to fix up the basement for us, the contactor died mid job no one told us people just stopped showing up. Thankfully anything not done we finished but we were out and I found out I was pregnant again. My son was born after a rough pregnancy with many many health issues, Skip the next paragraph if you don't want specifics on his health.\n\nhe was turning blue and the doctors couldn't figure out why his heart and lungs were good. Turns out he has a genetic malformation that he is the only known person so all the things they don't understand they blame on that. He has 3 kinds of seizures one that is specific to him, these were so constant before meds and knowing he was deaf till he was 3, he has autism, doesn't react to pain causing him to occasionally pick holes in his fingers to open wounds, he can't sweat and runs hot if he overheats that can cause a seizure, seizures can set off hallucinations, he has bowel issues we are still looking into and in diapers etc. \n\nBetween constant doctors visits for him and I was trying to get anyone to hire me. I had one job for a while but they had a bad year and i was fired from the marketing team. No one else wants to hire me with the doctors i need to balance for him and myself I still try to this day. So my parents help get us to the doctors, make sure we get out meds. I try to take care of the house and keep everyone happy but i fail alot.\nOntop of the military injuries above which have worsened i have other health issues that have cropped up. Again skip the next paragraph if you don't want specifics.\n\n My periods which had always been bad turned to constant clotting and blood loss episodes so after many doctors I got a hysterectomy.\nI get H1N1 and couldn't breath properly for 6 months when it started to go away I kept falling asleep. All this time my ankle still deteriorating we find out my body while fighting the swine flu attacked apart of my brain I now have narcolepsy with cataplexy. To top it off while checking my head as i started getting terrible headaches we found out I had chiari malformation, not bad enough for surgery but we have to keep an eye on it. Thats when a bit of brain tissue falls out the hole in the back of your head where your spine connects. So seeing that they check the spine and find degenerative disk disease. My saliva became constantly acidic, no one knows why eating my teeth out of my mouth,  leaving nerves exposed my parents help scrape together enough to have them pulled as i cannot keep getting fillings only to have them fall out a few months later it costs too much.\n\nBetween my doctors appointments and my sons appointment I am STILL trying to fins anything to help make a little money I used to get a little bit for art now and again but my computer battery died, i cant afford for the company to fix it so i need to try to do it myself without breaking it. \n\nI am fighting with both veterans affairs and trying to get odsp for me, my parents are still helping us with everything I am giving them the very little I make. The only good thing happening at this time i met a man who also left a bad relationship he is my soulmate and the kindest person I have ever met. He has a large debt from his relationship and with my health and my sons he moves into my family home. When he is done with his bills he helps as much as he can to cover diapers, meds etc.  You can imagine with all this going on between my son and I doctor's visits terrify me as I am afraid they will call me a munchausen mom or munchhausen by proxy even though i would give everything to be \"normal\" I am now a part time wheelchair user. I have been accepted those not seen yet by a specialist in complex regional pain syndrome and we hope to get it amputated. As it has gotten to the point that i cant have pants that grip my ankle are or wrinkles in my bedsheets at all without serious pain. My mother who is supposed to be able to retire is got part time job to help with the bills, I am trying to learn to crochet to sell it. While still looking for a job, and i cant be a driver as i am not legally allowed to drive because the narcolepsy is that bad. Things have gotten tight lately because of me and I feel I have caused and nothing helps. We even tried to do a go fund me but it has gone no where as of yet. My family has done so much for us and tells me that I am amazing and we will figure it out, I am worth it etc. All i see is no matter what I do i may cost my my family as they try to make sure I am ok. There is other things that have happened but this is long enough as is I am sure some peoplewill think this is fake and I don't blame you.... Why can't I just have something good happen so i can help my family after all they have done? I feel like such a leach sometimes. Especially since my sister also helps if my mom asks. She s 13 years younger than me, now in her 20s. I do whatever I can to at least help around the house since everyone does so much for me. But i still feel like its a drop of sand in the sea as far as any sort of compensation goes.\n\nAm I a leach? How can i fix this",

    "postText": "24M, I realized I prefer older girls at age 21. They're independent, can handle themselves, confident and especially the extroverted type is so irresistible. I'd failed courting two girls on separate years; they came into my life at the unexpected moments.\n\nOne ghosted me halfway through courtship, only to discover her 4 months pregnant working at a new cafe. She had a smoking habit and tendency to wear revealing clothes even at work, had tattoos, very outgoing and positive. But when she ghosted me and transferred to a new job, she changed to long baggy clothes n hid her tattoos, but even the apron couldn't hide her bulging belly. Cried my way home lol. \n\nSecond was going well, a senior from my school. She was an accountant, elegant, had a solid goal to have children and half retire at age 33. I was surprised to have her telling me she wanted to have kids on second date. I was like \ud83d\ude2e, but ok nvm I thought, I could readjust my life priorities and work together to reach her goal since I liked her. Then slowly as we talked, she revealed she had a sugar daddy who she'd slept with n been financially supporting her. Naturally that didn't quite align with me n I left, but I still wanted to stay as friends. Close to half a year later, she confided in me she got another stream of income from a successful married businessman. (No wonder I felt weird n off when she said if a man cheated it's usually the wife's issue, her value was a bit fked up, she didn't mind being a mistress at all if it meant there's money. I can pay for dates and provide but definitely not at a degree of a businessman; and she had multiple ones.",

    "postText": "Jfc. That was the most pain I\u2019ve experienced inserting something into my vagina since childhood. So gross too, having to use a finger to get it in. Not to mention how difficult it is to get an angle where that\u2019s even possible. It\u2019s SO uncomfortable even now, and yes it\u2019s up all the way, I promise you there is nowhere else to go. It\u2019s just made of fucking sandpaper or some shit. \n\nThis experience has convinced me even further to never get a menstrual cup either. I cannot possibly go through the discomfort of having to reach my whole fucking hand up there twice a day. Plastic applicators for LIFE.",

But yeah I\u2019ve always been very sensitive to pain from insertion, even the plastic applicator tampons sometimes are tough to get in, even when I focus on relaxing my muscles (which does help). Not to be weird, but past partners have told me I\u2019m quite small down there so I think there\u2019s just really not a lot of room so I can\u2019t handle much friction. \n\nI\u2019ve always managed to avoid the OB tampons, but today I had no other choice and holy hell it was torture.\n\nThank you for commenting and bringing that up, I\u2019ll keep it mind for sure!",

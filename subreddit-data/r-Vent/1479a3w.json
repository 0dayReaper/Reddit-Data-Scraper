    "postText": "Ive been in a long distance relationship for almost 3 years now, diferent countries, and its finally taking a toll on me and my life. We applied for fiancee visa a year ago and still nothing, I was getting done with college so I felt useful and like I was doing something, now im done with college but have to have my life on hold because im still waiting to move in with my fiancee, my friends are lame and rarely up for anything fun, my relationship is starting to go down a boring and indiferent zone, I just have to hang on a bit longer but its so damn hard now, ever since April it got unbearable, I still have to wait at least more 4 months like that. The waiting game is the worst because is one you don't play, you can't do almost nothing about it but watch, I can barely engage in other activities because it leaves my man uneasy thinking I will meet a guy and since we are distant I will fall in love or wtv he thinks.",

            "comment": "sounds like you're trying your best. one thing i noticed is you said you can barely engage in activities because of him; if he loves you and trusts you then he should get over his insecurities. you are loyal to him it seems but at what cost. is he really there for you? other than setting boundaries on what you can enjoy, what are you really waiting for? i dont want to speak against 'love', i dont know you or him; but maybe you deserve to meet someone who can be there and build with you, someone who trusts you equally that you can engage in your own activities and live life happily",

BUT i love this man and we are very close to no being long distance anymore, thats why im being patient, but at the finish line is seems that it gets harder?! I dont know, but i did set a limit for how long i will wait",

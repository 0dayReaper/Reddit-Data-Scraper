    "postText": "I am 35, will be 36 next month, and I've worked my ass off to just try and make some kind of life for my daughter. I try to be great to people, but it seems that the better I treat people around me, the more enjoyment they get out of breaking my heart and mind. I currently have a roommate who is an alcohol addict, as well as other substances I'm finding out. I have never lived with someone who had a drinking problem, and the description that was given to me beforehand was just that \"he drank\". I should have known that something was amiss when my roommate made me agree to never discuss anything that happens in the apt as I would no longer be welcome. Within the first week of being here, he got drunk and flipped out on me verbally, calling me random pos etc. I was freaked out and didn't understand what was going on, so breaking my roommates rule, I reached out to his brother n law. Someone I thought was my friend. Because I had reached out to my friend, he then freaked out more and demanding I leave. I spent that whole night terrified and crying. I'd just been in a situation before this where another person I considered a friend and who I'd paid full rent too had helped me to lose my then job and also sat back while a family member rooming with us pushed him to put me out. This is my fault as I had not yet been on paperwork for the place as we were literally all moving into the place together. The next morning, we talked and everything seemed OK, but it ended up being like an every other week event where he would get twisted and start arguments or just doing fucked up stuff in general. He has a homeless friend for example, he has constantly had this homeless friend over even though I have asked him not to and to respect my wishes as a roommate. Part of the reason I asked this was because on top of the guy stealing things like groceries from me whenever he would come over, which would be fine if they had only asked. My main thing is to ask because it's only right, and as we both get our own groceries, it helps me to keep track of what I need to replace. I also dislike this person because I've been homeless multiple time, and never have I had someone offer to help me and just sternly told them no. For instance, my roommate snuck him in once and asked him to take a shower so that he could help him to start working, apparently he knows a guy at a local sandwhich place. This guy just straight up told him no to the shower, and no to even putting in the effort to work. Because my roommate will still do whatever this guy wants even after this, I started not to like this guy even more. My roommate then tells me he won't be coming by anymore. He still brings the guy over when I'm in the room and he thinks I don't know, and will even go so far as to make him snacks and shut and personally deliver to him across the street at the corner store he sits in front of religiously. On top of all of this, I had a work from home customer service job that I had worked hard to get before moving in here. Of course the stress of having the drunk arguments almost daily combined with the stress from work because I had no safe place in between broke me. I recently left my job because it was too hard to take calls and have a drunk guy freaking out over something to the point where my customers could hear him through my calls. The worst part is that my so called friend that set all this up on the first place has completely abandoned me to this fate, even after reaching out and explaining to him that I was not able to reach out due to the commitment I had to make to be here that he was well aware of beforehand. This is just a tip of the iceberg, there's so much shit to this. I'm tired of being gaslit, tired of being lied to, and at this point tired of even existing. To treat a homeless guy who doesn't want to take any steps to better themselves like a king, yet treat the person living with you and busting ass to make some kind of life for themselves like trash is insane, and it really makes me think.",

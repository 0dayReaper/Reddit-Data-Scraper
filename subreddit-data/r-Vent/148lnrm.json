    "postText": "losing my shit rn. im so mentally unstable, and im having breakdowns almost every day. I feel like when people try to get close to me, i go from barely responding to giving every single bit of my energy, and its just too much for them, and they eventually leave coz for me? they're one of my closest friends now, but to them, I'm just one of the friends they casually talk to when they're bored. and every time i wanna tell people and talk to them about my emotions and vent it out, my mind turns blank, and i just can't say anything. I can only say things online to people i don't know at all, and the problem is they don't care, so i just constantly just cry and overthink to myself and do things to make me forget all about my feelings and thoughts in the short term",

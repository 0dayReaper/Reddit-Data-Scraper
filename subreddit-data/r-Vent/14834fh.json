    "postText": "I have the strong desire to serve my country an its people, I wish I could perform activism and sports without having the need to spend money in living utilities. Nobody forced me to work yet I have to do it to have money to live! Nobody is forcing me to study yet I need a title that represents I'm supposed to know something because my mommy and daddy don't have the contacts buy me a law o medicine title like most of my rivals or have had a granddady that stole land and gold from the people they enslaved like most of the youngsters with embassy nominations and hollow prices.\n\nI'm scolded because they do all of this because they've never worked for anything in their lives and they need a feel of accomplishment. After mommy and daddy die and leave them their millionaire inheritance they will forget the politics game they've been playing all long. I've seen so much human talent getting missed because they didn't have the luck to have money!\n\n I'm so salty.",

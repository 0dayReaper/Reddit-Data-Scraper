    "postText": "As I listened to my boyfriend explain why he loves his parents, a feeling of guilt and somber longing came over me. He described the fact that they raised him to be the great person he is, with manners, gentleness, and fervor. He told me his parents learned to respect him for dealing with the trauma he endured, and how they knew it made him all the more well rounded. As soon as he said that I started crying, not just because of what an amazing, wholesome, strong man he is, but also in regret for myself. Regret for the fact my mother blamed me for being groomed. Regret that I never had a close relationship with my father. Regret that my parents hate each other half the time. Regret I couldn\u2019t care better for my sister. So much regret came over me, it was unbelievable how I felt. I\u2019ve known my family and home life are dysfunctional since my early childhood. But it felt as though the final thread was pulled with what he told me. I shattered at that, loosing all feelings I had left invested in my family. Pain is so common when you must abandon those who taught you so much, but I must separate myself mentally, or else I fear for my own health.",

    "postText": "I missed my chance with a great guy and I\u2019m so frustrated with myself. When we first met I was fresh out of a 2 year relationship where my ex cheated on me the last 8 months of the relationship. I was devastated and undoubtedly not ready for a relationship. That\u2019s when I met C, he\u2019s been there for me and admitted his love for me several times, when he did I would try to gently shut him down because at the time I didn\u2019t feel the same which was okay to him because he didn\u2019t want to date in high school. I\u2019ve always found him attractive but not to date. As time has went on I started to have a change of heart and started to see him in a different light. When I started to get the courage to explore these new feelings he came out with a girlfriend (she asked him out, relevant). I was undoubtedly upset but I told myself it\u2019s on me and he\u2019s within all rights to date. That was until he told me he didn\u2019t really want to date, he tells me he\u2019s happy and she\u2019s happy but when I ask if he\u2019s really ready for a relationship he tells me no. This makes me feel like he said yes out of responsibility not because he likes her. And he will flirt with me and I him (I know I\u2019m horrible) and he always tells me I\u2019m closer to him than she is, I ask him why he doesn\u2019t leave her and he just changed subjects. Times going on and I\u2019m starting to see him in a totally different light and I\u2019m just disappointed I didn\u2019t give him a chance when he was there. Neither of us were ready but if I did try would I have to hold my feelings back now? Would I have to see him unhappy in this relationship? I wonder am I biased because it\u2019s not me he\u2019s with. Who knows but I wish I gave myself more of a chance to explore things with him. I\u2019m happy if he\u2019s happy and am totally okay with holding my thoughts to myself but when he\u2019s upset it makes me worry for him, I hate that it may be true that he\u2019s dating her out of obligation. That\u2019s all just disappointed in myself.",

            "comment": "As long as you accept it and keep the peace in both sides, you did great. Sure, you didn\u2019t know how to manage your feelings like that until you saw him in a different light, but at least you told him how you felt, that should really be all that matters. Many people lose chances like these. It may not change anything, but at least you told him.\n\nAs for him, you should sit down and talk with him to determine if he\u2019s really happy in that relationship with the other girl. It may help.",

                    "comment": "I never told him how I felt unfortunately, when I finally got the courage to he was already with her. A few days before we become really close to it he never likes to get personal and the vibe was right but he feel asleep and went MIA. I have asked him recently I\u2019d he ready for a relationship. He said \u201cwith you or in general\u201d I said both and he said no to both I feel as though if I were to spring my feelings on him while he\u2019s already having a hard time is unfair to him. Not to mention I\u2019m about to leave for college and him for the army. The timing is no longer there and I have to accept this reality unfortunately, which is undoubtedly hard. He\u2019s a great guy and he\u2019s really nice to me probably not the best boyfriend considering he\u2019s with her but flirts with me but regardless. I appreciate your comment! Again with his girlfriend I do ask but like I stated previously he doesn\u2019t like to venture into too much emotions or into their relationship, I assume the latter is because it\u2019s me. Thank you though for the upbeat comment I really appreciate it!",

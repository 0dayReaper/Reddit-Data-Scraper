    "postText": "He emailed us yesterday apologizing. Something about him being on vacation? He said that he would publish today. Well today rolls around and he still hasn\u2019t published it. He sends another email saying something about circumstances preventing him from publishing it? Pretty much how he phrased it. \n\nIt\u2019s a 6 week asynchronous online course. I paid over $2000 for it. 3 days is A LOT to miss, especially when I\u2019m already taking a 5 credit chemistry course at the same time. I don\u2019t have time for his fuck up, I\u2019m insanely busy as is and I want to at least see the schedule.",

    "postText": "I really do love you and so I really do want you to just be happy. I wish that I could just move on like I have in the past. But when every person you meet is boring, and every date you go on is boring, and you just can't connect to anyone... when you finally meet someone that you can really connect to after 25 years of trying and dating, how do you let go of that? That's like being color blind your whole life and then having your sight completely cured so you can see all the vibrancy of color and then having it taken away. How can you go back to just being okay with a muted life? I used to find comfort in just watching things that I enjoyed and reading things that I enjoyed in my room alone. Now it feels like my prison. But everything else feels like pain. Even the things I've been using as comfort over the last year without you have started to lose their flavor. I don't feel any desire to keep going. I've been doing this for too long with no love of my own and it doesn't seem worth it to keep going.\n\nSpending Saturday at that concert with you was the absolute most fun I've had in more than a year. The bond between us is just ridiculous. And I don't want you to be with me just cuz you're afraid I'm going to die. I want you to be with me for all the reasons you've been telling me recently. That you miss talking to me so much. That you miss that I'm fun and smart and our intimacy. You're the one that has been fanning the flames of my hope. I'm so used to men just leaving and fucking their way into moving on but you haven't been able to let go of me either. I don't understand why we can't just be together and have a simple happy life. I don't want to be in this nightmare anymore. It's too much. It's killing me. And I'm trying to keep these thoughts somewhere that you won't see them so that you can choose without feeling guilty. It's hard when you're in this much pain to not just dump it on the person who's causing it. I don't know if I still have it within me to hope for somebody else. Or to keep trying when it was killing me even before I met you. Trying to date and not finding anyone I could connect with was draining me and I was drowning in the despair. How can I go back to doing that when I'm so tired and I found you? I really don't fit in here. Please let me die and don't follow me.",

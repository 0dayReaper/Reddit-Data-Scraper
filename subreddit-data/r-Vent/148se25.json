    "postText": "So I have a lot of budgie birds she wasn't my only bird but she was the first bird that hatched and she was very special for me\n\nYesterday I was asleep and my mom might have forgotten the cage door open or something and that birb flew out while the ceiling fan was on but it wasn't going so fast, my mom assumed it's a meh injury and didn't bother. When I wake up I find her completely unable to move her right leg at all and it was basically skinned. \n\nMy mom didn't really bother do anything until HOURS later she decided to call a veterinarian but there's a problem, she didn't ask whether he will take in a bird or not and she wasn't willing to even leave the house to go there. She told me to go talk to my dad who didn't wanna take part in any of our shit and she said she's not gonna let me go on my own for some reason (I'm 16). So guess what she was gonna do now, she tried to do DIY shit from YouTube because she believed it was only a broken leg or something. The bird didn't eat drink and barley moved, she was half asleep all the time like all the red flags that something is horribly wrong, obviously the diy leg splint shit didn't do anything and fast forward this moment my bird is lying dead in my hands and she tried to take her very last breathes. From January 2022 to today.",

Birds are lovely little things who bring a lot of joy to the lives they touch.\n\nSecondly, this isn\u2019t just on your mother. You forgot to close the cage door. You cannot just expect others to care for your pets. You should hold the blame as much as your mother. For personal growth reasons.\n\nYes the blame is mostly your mothers being an adult and not taking the injury seriously, or taking responsibility for the injury.\n\nThe most important thing is you learn from this and prevent it from happening again.",

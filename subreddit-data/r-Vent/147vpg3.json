    "postText": "im sorry if the title offends anyone, i thought it was a funny way to explain my thoughts lol\n\nToday my friend uploaded an old photo on Instagram with her one of her friends saying happy birthday to them. One of them has a black hair, the other has a red hair and this red haired girl is really hot. My current friend has a black hair and she's like a sister to me, we are really close. So i told her that red haired girl is hot and i want to date them.\n\nBut her boyfriend also has access to her insta. And he said why do you want to date my gf, i totally forgot she used to have red hair.\nAnd he kinda got really mad until i explained the situation to him, i said i would never date her because she is like a sister to me. Plus shes not my type. And i said youre such a cute couple to even make him chill. But he still suspects that im on wait to make a move on her lmao\n\nMy story in a nutshell: she was the only person who made me think \"i wanna date this person\" and it turned out to be an old photo of my best friend.",

What i meant to say was i never had any romantic or sexual feelings on any other people until i saw the photo of my best friend. i mean the photo didnt made me think any sexual thoughts but i always thought how great it would be if she ever got drunk near me and if we make out while we are drunk. Then i realize its a terrible idea and feel disgusted by myself. Because she has been my friend since we were 7 and she always relied on me and i always relied on her. She's basically like my sister, i also have a sister but i don't feel anything like that towards my sister and being with someone i can call my sister disgusts me.",

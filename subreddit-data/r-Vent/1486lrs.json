    "postText": "I hate him, I hate him so much. I hate him because he keeps looking at me and hugging me and telling me he loves me, but I know he doesn\u2019t, and I wish I could stop loving him. I look at him and I feel a like someone is twisting a knife in my stomach, and my heart hurts so much. I pretend that I don\u2019t know anything. I have to keep pretending that I know nothing until I can get back on my feet. I hate that I moved two hours away from my family, i hate that he had me quit my job so we could move to another city for his job. And we haven\u2019t even moved yet, and it been about two months, I could of kept working till we had to move. I hate that he tell me he\u2019ll help me learn how to drive but he just keeps blowing off the days we planned. Yes maybe I could push harder but I was to afraid to. I hate that I feel this way. I don\u2019t even know anybody here in this town. Im just stuck living with him and pretending that I\u2019m happy. I want to get revenge, and I know I can, I know I could destroy his whole life, his career, I could turn his family and maybe his friends against him. I could do that but I don\u2019t want to I just want him to feel guilty and regret. I know the better plan is for me to work on myself and to get my license and to find a apartment somewhere close to home. I don\u2019t know if this was the first time he\u2019s tried to cheat on me or if he has actually cheated on me. I just wish he meant it when he told me that he would never do anything to hurt me. I guess there goes three years of my life. I hate him, and I hate myself for believing and loving him.",

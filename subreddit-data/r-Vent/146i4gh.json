If you love her I won\u2019t push it\u2026 but just know that I love you\u2026 I\u2019m the one that truly loves you and I\u2019d do anything to be with you. You\u2019re the only man I want to marry, you\u2019re the only man I can see myself with forever, you\u2019re the only one I ever truly wanted kids with even though I had them with other people as did you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for our past but I honestly cannot live without you. \nI\u2019ve been in a horrible relationship for the past 10 yrs and I\u2019m wanting to escape this. I wish you\u2019d just come and save us from this nightmare\u2026 but I know this will probably never happen\u2026 as it\u2019s all just a dream of mine. \n\nI just hope you\u2019re happy Ryan. If I never see you again until the afterlife if there is one, I love you and im sorry. \n\nI miss you every day and miss your touch, sparky. \n\nLove always\u2026 \n\nMe.",

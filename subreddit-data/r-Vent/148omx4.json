    "postText": "She isn't physically abusive, but she is fucking exhausting. I know part of what she does stems from care, but I am 100% convinced the rest is just because she's a control freak. I am 22 and she is up my ass about my personal appointments, who I'm talking to online, who I'm dating, everything. I'll be as polite, obedient and robotic as she wants me to be but it's never enough, because I'm just \"acting this way to get what I want.\" \n\nShe dragged me away from my dad and convinced me he didn't want me and then my extended family told me he talks about me all the time in a good light and reminisces which made it clear she was lying with her own bias. She convinced me to move with her away from everything I'd known throughout high school and the only people who ever accepted me. \n\nI wish she was gone and I wish I'd stayed with my dad.",

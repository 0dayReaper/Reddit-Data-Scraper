    "postText": "I am still shaking from a few minutes ago, rhis is what happened:\nI went to go do my normal jerk off routine this arvo and everything is going welll, not great, not good, but as expected . So when i jerk off i hsve some paper towel scraps that I geyser into, sometimes for multiple uses. I prefer paper towel because it is sort of a cross between a sock and toilet paper. Not too weak but not too strong and you can recycle it which i assume is good for the earth. So, i grab my used papertowel square and I infold it from the crusty clump it was, and I geyser straight into it without ever looking and guess what i guess a little jumping spider snuck into it and made a little cum cave house. I geysered right all over the poor bugger and Im sure it just ruined his whole day, i tried wiping the cum off it but it wouldnt stop jumping around so fuck you asshole i tried to save you and you wouldnt let me. Im so pissed and sad i feel like i want to vomit because I love spiders but i also love to cum and i guess I accidentslly collided those worlds together and the outcome is pretty lame",

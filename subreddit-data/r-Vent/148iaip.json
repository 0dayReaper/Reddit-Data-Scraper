    "postText": "I always had an on and off relationship with my mom, she is bipolar and an alcoholic, she was also on hard drugs when I was a child and neglectful and emotionally abusive.  As I got older she became more of a friend than a mom but it's the only relationship dynamic we can maintain.  I've been struggling with schizoaffective, C-PTSD and all the depression/anxiety that comes with it.\n\nFor background info, my mom had a traumatic experience last year.  She almost died (would have been murder) and was in the hospital for a while.\n\nI was on the phone with her and was kind of venting about how I'm a low point in mental health and she invited me over for dinner and to talk.  Now, usually in our family its a contest of who has the worst life, if I'm sick someone else  is dying, if I'm hungry someone else is starving, etc.  We actually had a really nice, deep and supportive conversation about our health.  She has been diagnosed with PTSD from the event and its like she suddenly deeply understands everything I've been dealing with.  There was a lot of hugging and for the first time in a long time she felt like a mom again.\n\nNow I'm just confused and sad.  It was a nice night but with her its always back and forth.  I'm stuck with anxiety waiting for the other shoe to drop.  A lot of the trauma in my life was from her and while our conversation was healing, I still have those thoughts that I will be punished for opening up to her.  Just a really weird situation and I can't talk to her about this specifically.",

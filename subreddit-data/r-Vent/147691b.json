It was cruel and wrong and I hope your attacker gets bitten hard by karma. \n\nI am transfem and was sexually assulted when I was 11yro. There was no-one I could trust to talk to about it. I know this isn't much of a statement, but your Queer community loves you and supports you.\n\nCan I offer you a digital hug? \ud83e\udec2",

They mean well but they mostly do not understand. It is a lot to take in all at once so just remember to take deep breathes. \nIf you want to talk i will most definitely listen. Sometimes it is nice to hear an outside perspective or just vent to someone who understands how you feel. I hope you feel better in whatever that means for you even if you never tell, that is completely up to you.",

    "postText": "I can't tell exactly but my moms been cheating for maybe 2 years at least and we only started putting the pieces together over the months. Last year my dad was kicked out and my parents are slowly working on a future divorce. Their marriage has been tortuous for everyone in the family and no one has been happy for over a decade. I was relieved it was finally happening but one thing I didn't realize is that she finally chose to dump my dad because she's been hooking up with her coworker and thinks she can replace him. I don't want my dad around but I don't want this scumbag either. My mom thinks I'm too harsh on him cause I don't know the guy but what I do know is that this fucker didn't give two shits about screwing a woman he knew was married and he himself has had countless failed marriages. I think that alone is telling of his nature. I don't believe any relationship built on an affair will ever end well but my mom has these disgusting rose tinted glasses about it. For weeks she's been disappearing at night to hang out with him and coming home late. Tonight she texted that she'll be staying the night and won't come back until morning. She's not even fucking divorced yet, she's committing adultery as we speak. I can't stand this disgusting display. I'm not exactly a religious person but I pray some damn sense will be knocked into her head. The whole \"he's different, he would never\" was the exact same shit she told her family when she married our shitty father and ruined her life along with our lives as well. I have no faith in her judgment. I hope she wakes the fuck up.",

    "postText": "For context my girlfriend and I have been dating a year and ever since the start of the relationship she's known that I'm a musician and my all time top teir love language is to actually do anything music with my s/o such as singing at the top of our lungs together dancing sharing songs with eachother  go to concerts and create Playlists together ect. Her best friend is coming to town in about a month or two and she's 100% fine with doing everything I just listed with her I did talk to her about it and mentioned that it actually kinda hurt that she'd tell me she'll do everything I'd wanna do with my s/o with her best friend but not with her boyfriend especially when I've tried my best to utilize her love language to be closer to her consistently all the time but not once have I felt like she's even tried to break out of her shell and do any of that with me she won't even let me know what type of music she listens to or anything I care about her and everything I'm just frustrated when I'm trying to conform to her love language to show I  care but she hasn't once tried to utilize mine but will do it with her bestie for the restive. I've talked to her about this multiple times too and she still tried to use my love language for me I don't wanna push her into doing things she doesn't wanna do but when I hear that she'll do it with other people but not me it hurts",

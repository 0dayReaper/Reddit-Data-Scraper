I live in a small town in the rural midwest of the US. I\u2019ve been told so many hurtful things by my family alone. \n\nI always have these feelings but the reason I\u2019m just blowing up and venting now is because I was just scrolling on tik tok and an ad for an AIDS prevention foundation came up (think it\u2019s the Elton John Foundation but not sure). I went to the comments to show support and got I regret it. A bunch of people commenting things like \u201cStop grooming our children!\u201d And \u201cNope.\u201d And just stupid shit like that. The ad had nothing to do with children. Didn\u2019t show anyone like that.\n\nQueer people aren\u2019t trying to fucking groom people idk how people just started think that but it isn\u2019t true. We\u2019re hates just cause we\u2019re queer. I\u2019m tired of being bullied, outcasted, etc. I think every queer person can back me up when I say LEAVE US THE FUCK ALONE!!!\n\nAny striaght allies out there, thank you for everything ya\u2019ll done. It does truly help.",

Because in their mind if they can defeat the transgender or queer menace then they won't be afraid anymore in the world will be perfect, when the reality is that they'll just move on to the next target of their ignorance and bigotry.\n\nThere's a reason all of the exact same people that were against women Getting the right to vote were also against the civil rights movement and were also against immigration and same sex marriage. It's all the exact same small people that are afraid of their own insignificance in the greater world and as a result they scream and cry and make a fuss because they don't know what to do. They don't want to lose the completely artificial place of power that has been provided to them simply by virtue of being cisgender or heterosexual or a man for that matter.\n\nThe good news is, A lot of this bullshit is starting to fade in younger generations. Yes, there is still ignorance in younger generations, but it is a different type of ignorance that is ironically more accepting of certain groups than past generations.\n\nSo yeah, there may be racists or misogynists in Gen Z, but they may be more welcoming of queer people. Or they may even be openly queer themselves. It's not perfect, kind of a step in the right ish direction in terms of a word that has a greater diversity of opinions?\n\nEDIT: as demonstrated in some of the comments here, there are even transphobic queer people.",

Im saying u cannot consider yourself trans if your \"non binary\" since u have no desire to actually transition or live the life of thw opposite gender, there is no middle ground your either boi or gurl unfortunately. I feel as if its just labels for thw sake of labels. How can one feel something youve never felt? You cannot. I wholeheartedly support trans people but non binary is a huge slap in the face, it take away from the debilitating struggle of body dysphoria and people who wake up in the wrong body everyday. Again i hope this better explains my point so it can get through that skull :)",

That experience alone has given me some sort of PTSD to the point that unless I\u2019ve known you for a long time and trust you, I don\u2019t want anything to do with you because of what\u2019s happened to me.",

It\u2019s as if our space and our safety doesn\u2019t matter anymore as long as trans people \u201cfeel comfortable\u201d. Meaning womens safety comes second to trans feelings. \n\nI\u2019m not saying all but In my own personal life and friends, there have been instances where someone talked about their sibling getting their ass beat by a trans woman in the bathroom. One of which was a  little 5 foot 14 year old biological girl got her ass beat by a 6 foot trans women and was put into the hospital. Guess who got suspended? The biological girl, even though she was hospitalized and the reasoning was emotional threat to the trans women\u2026 \n\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying all trans are like this nor am I saying it\u2019s common but, there is an entitlement running rampant within the community and it\u2019s scary to see how much they can get away with. \n\nI\u2019ve heard more trans people saying how \u201ccis\u201d people should die than cis people saying trans should die. \n\nI keep hearing Obi Wan Kenobi telling Anakin \u201cyou\u2019ve become the very thing you seek to destroy\u201d which pertains to the hatred of cis people from trans people and their movement. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m all for trans people living their life how they see fit and having the freedom to do so, but to ignore the normalization of hatred by trans people towards cisnpeople is getting out of hand and ruins what the movement was originally about. \n\nAlso the forced language. Changing definitions of things can lead to a very dark road into the future that ultimately doesn\u2019t benefit anyone and will cause resistance.",

Drugs based violence is a global problem regardless of gender.\n\nBiological women are not going to be erased. That is just stupid to be honest. By virtue of how reproduction works, cisgender women are not going anywhere anytime soon. Unless we as a society, all the sudden develop the technology where we can reproduce without sex, cisgender women are here to stay. Especially since your \"oppressors\" or whatever constitute a fraction of a percentage of the global population.\n\nYou are more likely to be oppressed and eliminated by heterosexual cisgendered men repeatedly trying to deny you basic rights and freedoms than you are to be oppressed by a transgendered person. And that's not just based off feelings, scientifically speaking the numbers say you are most likely to be assaulted, murdered, or just plain attacked by a white straight male then literally ANY other demographic in the world.",

The two will never be mutually exclusive, and you can in fact live together harmoniously. \n\n- Transgender people tend to be sweet. They can also be mean. This is because they are normal human beings, with a range of personalities. They are no more likely to beat your children than the average person. Listing ancedotes of supposed violence means nothing if you can't back it up with statistics. \n\n- No definitions are being changed. Gender and sex have always been different terms in the medical sphere. People who fall outside of the \"norm\" have always been here. See: unisex people. These terms are just coming to light more often as we modernize. The internet spreads information at light-speed. \n\nFor the record, I think your claim that there are more transgender people encouraging cis gender death is bullshit. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause transgender people are several times more likely to be beaten, molested, murdered, and extorted than cisgender people. I have also never met a transgender person who genuinely believed cisgender people should die, even in my years-long tenure in the community. Grow your perspective. &lt;3",

But that is not 100% tied biological sex. If it were, Then men of any level would consistently outperform females, when that is plainly not true in any capacity.\n\nAnd it is incredibly patronizing that people act like they need to protect the dignity of female athletes, when female athletes in their respective sports are consistently stating that they do not care if they compete against transgender women.\n\nIt is blatantly arbitrary bullshit to try and apply science to this particular thing, when on any other given issue, those same people are completely willing to ignore the science in favor of whatever their belief system tells them to believe.\n\nIf you have an issue with transgender people, That is fine. Be honest and own that. And either educate yourself so you no longer holds your bigoted views, or just be honest with the world and be a front that you don't like a certain demographic of people.

Ultimately, (and I\u2019m really sad and sorry to say this), I think much of this problem comes from WITHIN the percentage of gay or queer folks. Bear with me.\n\nThere has been research done into people who say they are \u201cvery homophobic\u201d, and the evidence shows that many of them are queer themselves. It seems there is a loop-a vicious circle-where some elements of society promote the idea that being gay is the *worst* thing they can be (and in order to maintain this very strange narrative, they have to invent widespread pedophilia). \n\nThis leads to fear and self-hatred amongst those in the community who are gay (or in some way queer), which leads to a kind of \u201carms race\u201d of hatred, where people turn their darkest fears outward, whilst trying to maintain their \u201cstraitness\u201d by insisting on their homophobia.\n\nWe really should automatically look on the most severe homophobes as queer people-albeit very oppressed (by their communities-and by themselves) damaged and closeted. I can\u2019t help but feel that, if we emphasise this ALWAYS when dealing with severe homophobes, we may make SOME progress towards making some of them think again and step back.",

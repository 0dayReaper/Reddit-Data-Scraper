We have a toddler and another on the way that we just found out about. Might not even be mine if I\u2019m being honest. She\u2019s cheated in the past and I confronted her. We split up for a bit but tried to work things out since we had a baby and decided it\u2019s better for my kid to have both parents. Now I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s at it again. If we got divorced, she would move across the country, where she\u2019s originally from and I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll take our kid and I\u2019ll never see my kid again. We\u2019re not in the greatest financial place either so lawyers isn\u2019t really an option. My kid literally told me this morning to never leave, broke my heart knowing what might untenably happen. Help?",

            "comment": "Get a dna test as soon as that kid is born. If it isn\u2019t yours, you might have grounds for getting custody of your kid. The lawyer can spin it that she\u2019s bringing strange men around her kids, and that\u2019s not safe. In any case, you\u2019re going to need to talk to her about it. Let her know that she crossed that line before and you forgave her, but she\u2019s obviously made it her choice to continue to lie and cheat, and you deserve better than that, and are no longer invested in your marriage. Let her know you will be pursuing a divorce as soon as it\u2019s feasible. Sleep in a separate bedroom, but don\u2019t move out. If you leave the house, the lawyers will say you abandoned the house and your family and will use that as proof that she should get custody of the kids. If you really think she\u2019ll snatch the kid away, start taking notes of the shitty things (if any) that she does involving the kids. No matter how small it may seem. Does she go off to cheat while she\u2019s supposed to be home with the kids? Does she drink in front of the kids? Have there been any injuries while they were in her care? You better try to save up, cuz when kids are involved, it starts getting expensive. \n\nAll I can say is, it\u2019s better to be divorced and separated than fighting with your wife in front of the kid(s) constantly. It\u2019s up to you, though. She obviously didn\u2019t keep up her end of the deal in the marriage, and you have to decide if you want to fight to keep her, or if you\u2019ve had enough. Because, if she\u2019s cheated on you twice, it\u2019s not going to stop. Maybe you can have an open marriage. I don\u2019t know you. Maybe you both need to go to couple\u2019s therapy. Again, that\u2019s if you feel there\u2019s something worth saving. Good luck to you. That is a rough one.",

First of all, stop having sex with her, you don't want to catch any STDs or use condoms. \n\nTry and reason with her to end the current pregnancy, because you guys can't afford it. In truth, you will be responsible for the new kid regardless if it's yours or not, just because it was conceived while you two were married. Even though it may not be yours, the courts will choose the best for the child and the path of least resistance, could be a while to get the DNA and child management payments straightened out. If she insists on keeping it, make it a requirement that she get a DNA test while pregnant and make her pay for it since she's cheated in the past, you want to be 100% sure it's yours. It's expensive, but peace of mind whether it's yours or not will finally be addressed, and you'll be ahead in the process. I think DNA is a reasonable request, even if she isn't cheating again, so you can collect the facts. It only takes a blood draw from the mother and cheek swap from you, and it costs about $400-$1900 depending on the company near you, results in a week. I'd probably get your daughter one of those ancestry tests too, they are relatively cheap, and if she matches with your other family, you know she's yours too. They can test as early as 7 weeks preg. If the bills are all on you, I'd require her to get a job ASAP. Split the living costs 50/50, she lost the privilege of being supported when she cheated on you, that will keep her busy and creating further relationships. Don't tell wife how much you make or save, just tell her you need her to work, period. I suggest working alternating shifts to eliminate the daycare costs. \n\nShe won't know this for sure, but you will just be roommates and parents until the kid is old enough to have a say on who they want to be with, and you have had prepped yourself for having a better financial situation than her and built a stronger relationship with your daughter. I urge you to keep your kid oblivious to the marital issues, it's not her fault and kids don't need that in their headspace. Save your money, but don't keep it in a bank under your name, save it in cash. During the divorce you'll be broke, but if there's a custody battle you're going to demonstrate your financial stability by demonstrating the ability to earn and save. I'd ask for shared custody, which means you won't need to pay child maintenance. Have your daughter on your health insurance, this will be another factor in your favor and goes towards credit for maintenance. \n\nWhile you're buying time keeping it together, do some research and get yourself legal representation ahead of the divorce &amp; custody, they can tell you best how to prepare for it, as a father, given the situation. She will be parading men through your child's life, better to keep her close so you can keep your child's life less traumatic. Bide your time, make her get a job, save your money. I highly recommend you work on improving yourself in the meantime. The courts favor the parent with the highest education and ability to provide higher living standards.\n\nIf you KNOW she's cheating, and that's not acceptable for you, then divorce is the only choice, but The only question is custody of your child. If you keep her close until you're able to file, she can't leave the state during an active custody case. \n\nI wish I could say you should talk to her about it, but there's no point, she obviously doesn't care about marriage and her child. Just be patient and keep your  emotions under control. I hope the best for you and yours.",

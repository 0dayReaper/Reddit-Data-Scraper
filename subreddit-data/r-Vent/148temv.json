    "postText": "I just don't know. I know it's weird to vent to strangers online about this, but I don't have anyone else to talk to. A couple months ago I made another post basically venting about how to handle a coworker who was flirting with me when I really didn't want him to, but couldn't tell my husband because he was out of the country on work. I did follow some of the tips given on the post, mainly that I talked to my coworker first before going to HR. He said that he was sorry and that he must've been confused about my tone in our previous interactions, so he was sorry and he would stop, so I ended up not going to HR about it. I had this conversation in front of my interpreter and in the office breakroom, so it wasn't just him admitting to the flirting to me and me alone and then if it continued, nobody would believe me.\r  \n\r  \nHe stopped for a while and then a week ago, we had to go on a work trip together. We work at a larger newspaper in the city, and we were covering one of the little summer festivals that some of the more rural areas do. Technically it was his first writing assignment as an employee (he'd previously been doing secretarial work, but my boss has a policy to let any prospective journalist at least write a small piece for him, to test them out) and I was just there to keep an eye on everything and make sure he was representing the paper well. Usually it would be just one of us who goes but because it was his first time he needed supervision, and our coworkers (who previously hadn't taken my discomfort seriously) told our boss that the two of us get along well and that I wouldn't mind going. I did mind, first off because I still didn't fully trust the guy, and because I didn't feel comfortable leaving my kid alone for the weekend (he's sixteen, so technically old enough to be fine, but my husband, his other dad, is out of the country still and I get paranoid about stuff), but my boss promised that if I went, he'd publish an opinion piece I'd written a while back (we have a non-formal rule that opinion pieces written by employees are pretty much bottom priority in terms of publishing them compared to ones written by other citizens). So I went.\r  \n\r  \nI don't even clearly remember a lot of what happened before it all - apparently that's common - but I remember the actual action. I remember trying to tell him to stop, but I can't speak, and even in this moment I couldn't get the word out. I want to go to the police but I'm worried they won't take me seriously. I know a lot of male victims get pushed aside and ignored, and I don't know what to do. I've been to a doctor, and my injuries are minor, just bruises. I don't want to tell my husband, I don't want to know how he's going to look at me. I don't know what to do. I know what I SHOULD do, but I don't know if I can.\r  \n\r  \nI think I'm going to quit my job, when my husband gets back. Tell him I'm just not thriving in the creative environment or make up some other bullshit. We're both journalists, he'll understand whatever nonsense I make up about being a creative and needing a better environment, I don't know. I don't know what to do. I just needed to throw this out to the void, I guess, so I don't feel like my heart is being strangled in my chest every second of every day.\r  \n\r  \nMy son threw a party while I was away and it wasn't fully cleaned up when I got home. I almost wanted to laugh, because of course having to help my sixteen year old son clean up a bunch of soda cans and other miscellaneous trash is the perfect way to end it all. At least the kid had a good weekend with his friends, I guess.",

As a man raped by a man, and as a person with a disability, they likely will take your case VERY seriously. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve gotten all those ducks in a row, have taken your evidence and complaint to the police and filed the report, contact your husband. He needs to know what\u2019s going on. If you don\u2019t, if you wait til he gets back, he\u2019s never going to forgive himself. \n\nBut most importantly, go to the police and then tell your HR department.",

Talking it person will likely be better for both of you.\n\nIf your husband is a good person - if he doesn't blame you, judge you, or ask you to handle the situation in any way that you're truly uncomfortable with - then you're gonna be glad to have him your corner.\n\nYou said you know what you SHOULD do, and I believe that.  \nBut this situation... it's difficult.  \nIt's difficult because you'll have to make a choice between doing the right thing, and doing the right thing for YOU.  \nAnd I wouldn't judge you (nor should anyone) in the least if those two things aren't necessarily the same.\n\nUltimately, if your husband, while out of the country for work, were, hypothetically, raped or assaulted or otherwise taken advantage of in any way, would you rather he told you or just... never told you?\n\n And if he didn't tell you right away, but told you later... months, or even years later, wouldn't you still feel hurt or betrayed or confused?  It's scary, but if they are a good person, they won't make you regret telling them...",

This may help to have a group to bring up concerns with behavior towards the other employees and how that behavior escalated with you. Otherwise, you may be able to warn them with hints. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t, don\u2019t wash the clothes you wore. Don\u2019t wash anything with blood. Take immediate pictures of injuries. Get evidence of your doctor visits and the extent of the injuries, even minor. Do anything you can to save dna. Make a report if you feel up to it. It\u2019s the right thing to do, but it\u2019s terrifying and expensive and can take forever. Don\u2019t beat yourself up if you can\u2019t. It\u2019s humiliating. That being said, you made it through that, and I believe you can find strength to report. Even if nothing much comes of it, it\u2019ll be one more bit for if he ever harms someone else who reports it.\n\nAs for telling your husband, by no means do you have to. You can be vague and say things went very south at work and you\u2019d like privacy. You can inform him there may be rumors, and if he hears any to come to you for the truth, but otherwise you\u2019d like to keep the events private. It will be hard to hide depending on how reports go, so I\u2019d recommend telling him. He\u2019d want to support you, and if he doesn\u2019t? He\u2019s shit and you\u2019re better off.\n\nDon\u2019t make yourself think about what happened. Don\u2019t guilt yourself for being numb or emotionless. Don\u2019t run from it with alcohol or drugs, you\u2019ll have to sober up and face it eventually. It took me 6+ months after someone informing me I got raped for it to sink in and I didn\u2019t tell anyone until a therapist YEARS later, where o started laughing uncontrollably for what felt like forever until I was sobbing. Brains handle things weird and I don\u2019t want you to let ANYONE, not even yourself, tell you how to feel or process it. Do see a therapist though\u2026 edmr was life changing for me. \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m sending you all the love in the world. Sorry for the word jumble, but it\u2019s such a lonely void for a long time when this happens. I promise that while it may hurt forever\u2026 it\u2019ll be reduced to forgettable background noise majority of the time eventually. You will feel warmth again. \n\nAnd don\u2019t pressure yourself to have sex until you\u2019re ready (another good reason to be open with your husband)",

Go to your normal family doctor &amp; talk to them about what happened &amp; go on immediate sick/stress leave (if you have it) so you don't have to be in the workplace with this disgusting person. Write down every detail you can remember, even if it's fuzzy, and sign &amp; date it. Keep a copy of that for your own records and take a copy with you to the police station &amp; file a police report. \n\nOnce you've done that, notify your workplace (HR/boss) that you were sexually assaulted by the coworker who had previously been harassing you &amp; that you've filed a police report about it. You should also consider speaking to a lawyer about whether your workplace breached their duty of care to you (their employee) by putting you in a position to have to be with this person one on one after they knew he had sexually harassed you. Obviously that will be highly dependent on where in the world you live &amp; other employment factors which is why you should consult a lawyer. \n\nThe police will look into criminal charges against the individual who assaulted you, but a lawyer can advise on whether you have a civil liability case against your employer. I 100% get you wanting to leave the job - totally understandable - but if you can get some money out of your employer for their terrible handling of things that will help you accomplish that.\n\nIn terms of telling your husband, I can't imagine how difficult that must feel. Perhaps consider trying to book an emergency appointment with a therapist/counsellor to talk it through. I.e. you could speak to the therapist first by yourself &amp; then bring your husband in &amp; tell him with the therapist there. That way you'll have a professional available to help both of you process this huge trauma/shock and to give you advice on things that you can do individually &amp; together to help process it and support you. That's what I would do I think.",

So I don't actually know what to recommend that you do except to go to the police with this. If you are able to take pictures, get a R kit, everything, even calling a hotline for this type of thing to ask questions on what you should do is definitely recommended if you don't know what actions you should take.\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you OP.",

Some people behave poorly in shock, but it is so important to be able to speak about it ESPECIALLY to someone who cares about you, so you can continue to talk about it. Bottling up and marinating on that pain will cause it to fester. I\u2019m sorry that happened but the most important thing is being able to talk about it and get your form of closure, support and comfort",

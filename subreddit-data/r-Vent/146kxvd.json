    "postText": "Went to an all girl sex party. Yes, exactly what it sounds like. \n\nI was excited, dressed up, and I\u2019ve had some experience, so I wasn\u2019t super scared. My biggest fear was people pairing off and leaving me out, which was exactly what happened. The equivalent of being picked last for team sport. After a good 3-4 hrs, I left with blue balls and feeling very unwanted. Had a full on menty-b on the drive home too. \n\nLike am I ugly? Smelly? Weird? Creepy? Bitchy? Wtf is it? Everyone says nothings wrong with me but obviously there must be. I just can\u2019t continue going through life like this. \n\nThat is all.",

I wish there were more realistic experiences talked about when it comes to these parties. It\u2019s a wild scene and difficult to navigate through. I\u2019ll give it another try in the future. In a different country though lol",

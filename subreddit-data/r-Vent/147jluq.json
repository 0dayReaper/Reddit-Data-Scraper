And even then, more than 3/4 is just hers but she is so hellbent on saying somehow all of it is mine? I only have:\n-8 pairs of pants\n-5 shirts\nMy excuse for a mother who very lovingly doesn't abuse me as she loves to remind me:\n- 10+ tops\n-4-6 basket ball shorts (refuses to wear pants, and.gets mad at me when she has nothing to wear)\n-6 pajama bottoms\n- 5-6 pajama tops\n-10 leggings or \"stretchy pants\"\n\nAnd apparently all of those are mine? Until I try to dare wear something?\n\nAnyways, she tore a shirt she had over me trying to get rid of clothes that don't fit of or we just need to fucking get rid of them because we don't.have ANY room at all. And her response is just throw a tantrum and try to keep everything then gets mad at me when she makes a fucking mess I don't want.to clean.\n\nI can't handle this shit I'm so fucking done. I regret getting her help at all. I regret so fucking much. I should have left her when I had a chance.",

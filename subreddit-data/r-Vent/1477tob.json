    "postText": "Whenever something good happens to me, or something makes me happy, I want to share it with someone. I don't know why. It just makes me feel good to be able to talk about it and express my happiness. It makes me feel sad when I have to keep it to myself. Unfortunately, I often need to keep things to myself. I don't have any sort of support system, and my mother, who is probably one of my better relationships, is not someone I can share things with. \n\nNothing I do is good enough for her. \n\nI came home from the hospital and basically did nothing for a month because I was still so depressed. Then she told me if I didn't sign up for school or get back to work, she would kick me out. So, I applied for college. I got accepted. When I told my mother, she told me I couldn't do nothing until the semester starts and I needed a job again. \n\nI started searching for jobs and applied. My mother didn't care and didn't want me sitting around waiting for responses. Then I got an interview. The interview went well and I was just waiting on an email. My mother didn't care about the interview and got frustrated with me when a week passed with nothing. Then the company called me and, after some back and forth, they realized they typed my email wrong. I got a list of requirements I needed to complete (ex. police clearance, TB test) before starting, but I was basically hired. When I told my mother, she just asked me why I hadn't started working on the requirements yet (even though I had only gotten the call and email a few hours earlier). \n\nDue to some issues, like the doctor's office hours being different than what was posted online, and having many technical issues online while trying to complete a certification, it took roughly a month to complete all the requirements. While I was working on the requirements, I also went back to my old job at a bakery and picked up several shifts, so I wasn't doing nothing. But when I wanted to tell my mother about some friends I made online, and how happy I was, she only had a focus for whether my requirements were finished, when was I going to start my new job, maybe I should take more hours at my old job, etc. Every time I completed a requirement and shared it with my mother, she didn't care and would just ask about the next one. \n\nToday, I got home after an 8 hour shift at work, and I was exhausted, so I made myself some food. My mother came in the kitchen, and as I was cleaning up, I started to tell my mother about a writing exchange that I signed up for with my online friends, and how excited I was for it. As I was cleaning, I paused to face her while talking, and she interrupted me and told me I missed a spot on the counter and needed to clean it. I wasn't done yet and was going to get to it, but I held my tongue, grabbed some paper towels and cleaner, and did what she asked. I tried to continue telling her about the activity, but she then told me I shouldn't even think about writing anything until I signed up for the school grant she had told me about. \n\nI lost it. She had literally told me to sign up for the grant less than five minutes prior (she told me twice) and I had confirmed that I would do it (twice), and I was just trying to share about an event that was exciting for me but she couldn't even pretend to care. I am capable of both planning and participating in recreational events, and scheduling time for school and work and other responsibilities. Why the fuck does it matter if I decide to write tonight and work on the grant tomorrow? It all gets done eventually. Why does it need to be done right now? Why can't I just have a few hours to myself after three days of eight hour work shifts? Why do I always need to be productive? Could she just pretend to be happy for me and give me some kind of positive interaction? If she really couldn't, I would rather her just outright tell me she doesn't want to talk than to continually ignore what I'm trying to say. I actually started to tear up when yelling at her. \n\nMy mother said she did care about what I was talking about, but that she wanted to remind me about the grant. I told her she already reminded me (twice, may I repeat for the third time), and I had confirmed I would do so, and all I wanted was a few minutes to talk about myself, and she couldn't even do that! My mother only ever focuses on what she cares about. She denied this, and I finished cleaning the kitchen and went to my room. \n\nWhat I find interesting, fun, or worthwhile, doesn't matter to her. I can't waste my time lazing around and doing what I want when I could be working on school, or work, or taking care of the dogs (that aren't mine), or I could be checking the chickens (that also aren't mine), or I could be going for a walk instead of writing, or I should be doing literally anything other than enjoying my day off. \n\nI've literally never had a healthy work-school-life balance. I went from overworking and never having personal time, to swinging the complete opposite way when my mental health plummeted, and now that I feel like I'm finding a balance, it isn't good enough for her. Nothing I do will ever be good enough for my mother, and she will never be happy for me unless what I'm doing is productive to her. \n\nI know that the things she harps on me about are important, I know they need to get done, but none of them have deadlines or are required to be done immediately. I don't understand why I can't just take a day for myself without feeling guilty or being reminded of what I'm not getting done. \n\nAll of it makes me want to cry or throw something.",

    "postText": "Why does the idea of truly loving someone feel so foreign to me? I don\u2019t think I can ever love someone. I have crush on people but I have never asked someone out. Not because I am scared but it just doesn\u2019t sit right with me somehow. I fact that I can have feelings for someone deeper that just a silly little crush feels impossible. \n\nA couple of weeks back my friend asked me what I would do if my crush asked me out for prom. And I was like uhhhh\u2026ummm\u2026..idk. I would prolly say no. Because I have this feeling that no one can ever fall in love with me. Like I have genuine good friends who I know care for me. But just the idea that someone can fall in love with me just sounds wrong and unnatural. \n\nI don\u2019t know if my post makes any sense. And I didn\u2019t know where to post it so I posted it here. I just want answers as to why I feel like this. Any answer would be appropriate. Thanks in advance!",

I haven\u2019t voiced how much of a problem it is cuz I don\u2019t want her to feel bad, so she doesn\u2019t know that it\u2019s affecting me like that. I\u2019ve just been trying to find solutions on my own before taking it up with her. Also some people are nasal snorers (such as my gf) so mouth taping would be ineffective",

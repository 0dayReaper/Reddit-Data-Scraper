    "postText": "I'm a college student and I feel like I waisted this past school year. I just finished my finals, and I'm sure I failed all my classes. I feel like an embarrassment amongst my peers. I don't want to tell my friends or my family.\n\nI know I can do the work. I understand the material, but I can bring myself to sit down and focus. It feels that I'm shooting thoughts in every which way, but I can't get any of them to be the ones that I need them to for my assignments. It's frustrating because I feel like I have the tools that I need to succeed, but none of the will power to do so, even though I'm passionate about the material.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I know I want to continue with college, but I'm afraid of the next quarter. If I fail again, I don't know what consequences I'll face.",

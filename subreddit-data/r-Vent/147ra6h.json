    "postText": "Hello, the harsh reality hit today, I\u2019m 10kg over the weight I should be at.. I\u2019m not overweight via bmi rather the opposite fortunately. \n\nI\u2019ve been binging and heavily overeating for many months now and today when I tried on my bikini I really realised how much weight I had gained, barely any of my clothes fit and I don\u2019t have money to buy new clothes. \nI have sensitive intestines so I\u2019m severely constipated followed by diarrhea once every two weeks.. bad diet also means terrible sleep schedule \n\nI had a full blown breakdown and I\u2019m so angry at myself, why did I let it get so bad?? \nI feel like shit and I miss myself back in August 2022. \n\nBut I\u2019ve seemingly hit rock bottom so it can\u2019t get any worse right",

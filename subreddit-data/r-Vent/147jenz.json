Just screaming into the void here to be honest, and maybe the void will scream back.\n\nI just finished my first year at college, and it\u2019s made me realize what kind of hell being alone really is for me. For the first time in my life, I\u2019m at the core of my friend group. I get invited to events. They want to be around me and actively include me in their plans. I\u2019m in the group chats. I feel like these friendships are real, which isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve ever been able to say before. Throughout high school, feeling alone was normal for me. I didn\u2019t talk to people outside of school, and even then I masked so damn hard none of those interactions I had even felt real. But now, I\u2018ve gotten a taste of what real human connection feels like, and the notion of losing that again someday is terrifying for me.\n\nWe\u2019re all going to graduate in less than 4 years now (hopefully). We\u2019re all going to be scattered across the country like we are for the summer now, but instead of getting to go back and see them all again in a few months, we will rarely, if ever get to see each other again. Someday, I will be a story about their \u201cfriend from college\u201c they tell to their kids at the dinner table, but someone they will see maybe twice after their kids are born. We will never be this close again. I might never be this close to someone else again.\n\nI\u2019ve described my ideal future like this: I don\u2019t want a romantic or sexual relationship. I just want a best friend who I can be roommates with, but long-term and without the expectation that it will someday end. This kind of arrangement really isn\u2019t feasible in my tiny little nothing Missouri town. If I did find a cool roommate after I graduate, eventually the assumption is that they will find a partner and they\u2019ll find a place together instead, and I will be alone. I want a roommate that will still be here when we\u2019re 50, and unless I can hit the roommate jackpot somehow, that probably won\u2019t happen.\n\nThe idea of being alone for the rest of my life makes me want to vomit, but the idea of forcing myself into a relationship I don\u2019t want just to avoid having nobody when I\u2019m older makes me want to vomit too. Eventually, my friends will get married. Eventually, my friends will have kids. Eventually, my friends won\u2019t have time for me anymore, at least, not as much time as I need. I so desperately crave human connection and community, but I refuse to become a regretful spouse or god forbid, parent. Having relationships or children you don\u2019t want will destroy any semblance of a connection you had, and I know this from experience as one of those children my mom felt pressured to have. I also know from experience that trying to fit what you\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201c to be in order to feel connected to other people will be just as lonely as if you didn\u2019t have any of those fake relationships to begin with. I can never have a real, genuine romantic/sexual relationship, and yet that seems like the only way in this world I can get the long-term human connection I want so badly.\n\nI feel so alone thinking about my future and it hasn\u2019t even started yet.",

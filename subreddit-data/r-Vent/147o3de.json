    "postText": "I'll probably get roasted til the end of time for this but at this point I honestly dgaf, I just need to vent. I think I'm a pretty ok looking girl but a lot of people including my friends beg to differ and tell me that I'm hot and can get whoever I want (it's a nice compliment so that I don't mind). Thing is, yesterday alone I had six different guys texting me and asking me out on a date. Six. All six of them were random guys I legit never even met before and who made no effort to get to know me. It's always the same, they text me something random or a funny meme, I laugh and then it immediately switches to \u201cI think you're really good looking would you like to go out for a drink sometime?\u201d even tho they don't know my name, they don't know my age, they don't even know what country I'm from. It would be flattering if it wasn't followed by random selfies and them inevitably making the conversation sexual at some point. Now I feel like I can't even laugh at the memes or jokes they send me because it makes them think I'm into them.\n\nI know this makes me sound conceited and ungrateful as fuck but when you have to turn down not one, not two, not three, not four, not five but SIX guys in the span of 24 hours, it becomes really annoying. It gets to a point where a guy texts me nothing but \u201cHey\u201d and I already know where the conversation is gonna go. I'm sure these guys are all cool dudes who mean no harm but I feel like turning guys down is a regular part of my day now. Of course the irony is that the guys I'm actually into don't give even half a shit about me, but every other dude in a 2km radius does. Me venting right now isn't a reflection of their value, as I said I'm sure they're all cool guys, but when I get asked out constantly by people who barely engaged in a conversation with me beforehand I just feel like they idealize me and don't even bother to try to know me just because they think I'm hot or whatever. Now you'll say this is how dating works but I wish it wasn't tbh. I feel like a jerk for constantly rejecting people. Ironically, I'm extremely single and alone but getting hit up by random guys just doesn't do it for me.\n\nRoast ahead if you must, I know how I probably sound, I just needed to vent. I'm tired of feeling like an asshole every time I turn someone down especially when it happens several times a day. I go to NA meetings for my addiction and mental health and even get hit on while I'm there! It's therapy jfc, leave me alone. Anyway that's all I had to say.",

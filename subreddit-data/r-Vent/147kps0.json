    "postText": "i dont quite know for sure if this is the right place to vent about this but i dont know where else to go. i just needed to unload somewhere. things have been horrible lately. my relationship with my family is strained due to both parties at fault, my academic life is a mess, my skin is irritated, the electricity is out. i thought i could handle it, thought id push through and i wad doing good until an hour ago. i had a plan to sort all the things out, had an appointment with a doctor, my landlord was fixing the issue but my new earphones arent working anymore\n\nmusic has been a way for me to escape during the toughest moments of my life, i know i sound like a corward but ive never been a fighter, ive always given up and music helped me through it. i know i can listen to music without earphones but i just like it better when i have them plugged. before anyone says anything, i do have bluetooth headphones and airpods. i just like wired earphones better. but for some stupid godforsaken reason, no pair i buy seems to work for more than 3 days. the ones im uncontrollably crying over right now were my 4th pair this month. i dont know whats wrong, i dont know why the simplest thing in my life cant work correctly. i dont know why they all stop working, i feel so stupid for cryin over them but theyre my 4th pair. if my earphones cant work, if the smallest thing cant function like its supposed to for more than 3 days then how am i supposed to make anything else work. how am i supposed to fix anything. i can deal with my parents hating me, my grades flunking and the insane hot weather but why cant i deal with earphones malfunctioning. they look fine too, nothings torn, no outer damage but my phone wont connect to them for more than 10 seconds. i just wanted to listen to some music. i just want one pair to work. i dont want to keep buying more, im so tired of this. im tired of nothing going right. why wont they just work. why do i have to be so sensitive about everything. \n\nthis isnt a shitpost nor am i asking for anything. i just needed to tell someone, anyone about it. if you read it, thank you for your time and sorry you had to sit through my emotional wreck of a vent",

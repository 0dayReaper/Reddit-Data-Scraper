Don't let them have the satisfaction. Try anything you can to improve and show them they were idiots for treating you like dirt. Find someone who really cares for and use these feelings as motivation to become awesome. That or get payback, anyone who said that getting even doesn't bring you satisfaction clearly hasn't gotten proper satisfaction from revenge. These are currently my two plans as of this moment. Let me know what you choose",

Be the better man, and from how you're telling the story, the guy doesn't seem that interested in her, so in the best case scenario, he dumps her. Stay strong, and tell me how it ends",

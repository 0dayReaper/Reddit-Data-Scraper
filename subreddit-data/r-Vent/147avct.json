    "postText": "I don't know how to start this. To begin with I've never had anyone that I could tell my feelings but I took a leap of faith and it brought me here.\n\nI (17M) am a pathetic child who is disrespectful to my parents. At least thats what they tell me. I know for a fact that I am not the best child, amongst my siblings amongst my cousins or anyone at all.\n\nLast night, they sat me in their bedroom to have a \"conversation\". They found out that I complained to my grandmother and aunt that tending the family business was tiring and suffocating, and they took this the bad way. Somehow, it led to me complaining that the allowance I get was insufficient, which I never did at all. They then gaslighted me telling me that they gave me more than I account for. Sure, the one who recently has been remembering the most important things tells me this.\n\nHow did this one sided conversation begin? Well, I answered back. Rude, I know, but stuff shouldn't be packed in too much plus I answered that I was already doing that thing they were telling me to do. Which is ridiculous. \"Clean the table\" \"But I'm already doing it?\" \"Why the hell are you answering back?!\" WAPACK\n\nWell the conversation ended with me not having to go to the store anymore nor do I get that much money anymore. Well, that's fine ig? I'll just stay at home and probably clean cuz my mom can't do it that much, practice piano cuz I want to learn it or just probably fix the novel I was writing.\n\nBut then the day after, I woke up late because I didn't have to go to store anymore which is a win but it sort of felt empty but at least I could sleep a lot now and I don't have interact with people. I got on my phone to see if there was anything going on at the school GC. My mom saw this and took it. Well fine, this ain't new at all. Then she told me...\n\n\"Do you know why I took your phone? Because you don't know where you did wrong.\"\n\nI replied with \" I know, I just don't have anything to be sorry about.\"\n\nWhich led to her flipping out. And she asked why I became like this? They didn't raise me to be like this. She also asked if she did anything wrong to make me like this. I couldn't tell her anything because one, she's being too emotional, she won't ever listen to me. And two, I'm not good at talking and they'll probably take the wrong way as I was already becoming emotional too. \n\nSo I opted for a better solution, I texted it to the family GC.  She isn't at home rn, so while she was away, I wrote my true feelings. The things I hate, the things that made me who I am and sent it. \n\nI was absolutely terrified to send it because this shit can decide everything, do get to stay at the house or no, live or die. But I sent it because I wanted to be a better person  and I wanted a step forward.\n\nThey didn't take it all too well.\n\nMy mother read it first and she preached me. No empathy or whatever, she just told me that I was the problem. I know that that's why I'm telling you that I made mistakes but you made me as to who I am, such is why I'm taking a step forward to be better in the future but she probably never read it all in it's entirety. Crazy how people see only what they want to see\n\nIm giving up. Words can't get through them and I'm probably gonna get kicked out of the house. I just want to know if I took the right step on learning how to become better.",

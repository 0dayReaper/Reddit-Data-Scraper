    "postText": "I\u2019ve always thought I was annoying and have always been told I was. The past month or so I have truly felt like the most annoying person to ever exist. The last almost two weeks I have felt extremely more annoying and I tried to distance myself from those closest to me that I feel like I annoy. My best friend noticed and we talked about it which did help so much but I feel annoying again with things I say and do. I\u2019m not sure if I should bring it up or not because it\u2019s not her fault and not her responsibility to make me feel good about myself. I havnt really talk to my two closest cousins lately either, the vibes are off and it just seriously makes me nauseous at the thought they could be upset with me. It\u2019s hard for me to ask them about it because I don\u2019t like to tell people how I feel especially when it comes to things that are mainly caused by my mental health, like the most extreme overthinking, because it scares people away. I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore it is so hard to go each day feeling this way. I just wish I could not say or text 90% of the things I do. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m mean I\u2019m just annoying\u2026 with things I send, post, text, just dang near anything I do and anyway I operate around people. Has anyone ever felt the same way and overcome it and if you did what are some things that worked for you? I\u2019m making an appt with an old therapist. The latest ones I have went to were not good for me. Other than therapy what are things that help?",

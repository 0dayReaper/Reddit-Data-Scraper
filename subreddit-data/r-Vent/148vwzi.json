    "postText": "I got my drivers license today and I was so excited because I finally passed at the age of 20, and I spent a lot of time doing my makeup, I am goth so I shave my eyebrows off and I draw them on, but before I draw them on I moisturise my brows with lotion or a moisturizer, anyways I take my picture but I didn't look at my picture till I was already in the car and omfg it looked like someone smeared cum across my forehead and I'm not even joking. I rubbed it in and everything, off camera it looks like I have nothing there, it's all rubbed into my skin. Their cameras are just good enough to pick up the lotion/moisturizer I put on before. Someone end me please. Also no you can't see the picture lmao.",

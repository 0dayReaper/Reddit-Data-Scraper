    "postText": "The last 2 weeks have been mad stressful. Miscommunication with my partner that made me think we broke up, got dismissed from my old job and couldn\u2019t find a new one due to them not having the time to train me.\n\nThis is in the process of being resolved. My bf communicated with me again. Apparently he thought I was breaking up with him over misinterpreting something I said, I misinterpreted something he said. I think we are on the same page now. We are still together. I also found a new job although it\u2019s not as good as the old one but it\u2019s money I suppose. But while that whole shitshow went on I relapsed. Bought a pack of cigarettes and I\u2019ve been smoking like 3 a day. I was clean for an entire year.\n\nI\u2019ve been a smoker on and off since 2019. Happened when I was under a shitload of stress from college finals. I\u2019ll admit, I wasn\u2019t a massive smoker. A pack usually lasted me like a week, but when things were really shitty with my ex (the psycho who defamed me and turned all my friends against me by hacking my social media, posing as me and harassing a bunch of people after I broke up with them years ago), I smoked as many as a pack a day and I don\u2019t want to go back there. The worse shit gets, the more I have. When I\u2019m not stressed I don\u2019t even want em. But when shit is bad it\u2019s bad.\n\nI\u2019m disgusted with myself.",

            "comment": "this response might sound generic but its really true: you might just need to exercise more. hear me out, because this really helps me n im just learning it. our bodies are meant to be utilized, we have energy that is expected to be spent everyday- like for survival thats how we evolved. so you need to force yourself to exercise, burn that energy through your muscles, or all that energy will get you anxious, your mind will start having to burn it off if your body doesnt. and its not really normal. our ancestors didnt evolve with our modern routines. force yourself to exercise and youll notice the bad thoughts are easier to defeat",

My pain management team told me to push through and just do little bits where I could, like even 5 minutes was better than nothing! I met a disabled PT who had a similar issue to me and showed me adapted exercises and which machines in the gym absorbed shock to minimise my pain. Life changing!\n\nIf I'm feeling low or having a tough day with my pain I run for 10 minutes on the treadmill, I feel loads better mentally and because of that my pains less bothersome too.",

Often when I have low spots with my depression I feel like I have no energy, no desire to do anything, just generally drained. The best advice I could give you is get outside and get some exercise. I\u2019m not saying hit the gym 5 days a week, I\u2019m saying find an activity you like doing outside and do that. It can be walking, bird watching, biking, swimming, rollerblading, or even just reading outside. Getting out of the same walls and routine helped a crazy amount with breaking out of mental ruts. Also, don\u2019t beat yourself up or feel guilt for feeling sad \u201cwithout a reason\u201d. Mental illness is a bitch, and sometimes we have bad days without provocation and it\u2019s on these days where you gotta be gentle and kind with yourself. Good luck OP",

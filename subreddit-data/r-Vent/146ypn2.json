    "postText": "I\u2019m sorry I just found this out and it\u2019s probably going to be aall over the place, like I\u2019m shaking and I feel like I\u2019m gonna throw up.\r  \n\r  \nYesterday he when out with his friends for a cook out and to go bar hopping, he told me befor he left that he would come back home. But he didn\u2019t come back home till like 7 this morning. I know he when to his friends because he posted some stories on his snap. So I saw that he was with them. Well once it turns to midnight I call and ask if he\u2019s coming home and he says he is but he\u2019ll need to get an Uber, he went to the town over and he\u2019s the only one of his friends that lives in this town so he couldn\u2019t get a ride. I tell him ok and that I\u2019ll wait for him it\u2019s only like a 30 minute drive so it that far. Well at 1230ish I call him and get no answer. I keep calling him, he doesn\u2019t respond until like almost 2 am. He told me he fell asleep in the car before he could call an Uber and that hell come home soon. I said ok I was upset because he told me that he for sure would be home tonight. Well he come home at 7am and I kinda cold to him so he lays down on the couch after like an hour is I come and lay with him be I felt bad for being mad at him. We cuddled and I fall asleep for 20ish minutes. I get up and go to the bathroom and when I come back I see that he\u2019s still asleep. Something tells me to look at his phone I know it\u2019s bad but I just wanted a put my mind at ease. I see nothing at first and when I\u2019m about to put it back I decide to look at his recent look up on snap. I see two girls. I click on one of them and he asked her if she was in town but she didn\u2019t respond so he said never mind. My heart dropped because at the past text show that she was an ex. I don\u2019t want to but I click on the other girl and they talked, he told her he misses her and thinks about her body all the time, how he wished he could go to her date and fuck her the whole thing she saying stuff but not responding to his other text instead she tell him how he\u2019s doing so good and he\u2019s making it so far and how everyone is probd of him. He tell her how he wishes he was single and and wants her. She keeps telling hime not to do anything that not to ruin the good things he has now. I took pictures of it all, if I don\u2019t check his recent I wouldn\u2019t have known he talked to them because he deleted them of the main page.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m sorry I just needed to get his off my chest, but I guess my question is what do I do we\u2019ve been together for three years. I quit my job because he told me we were going to move and that I should find a better jobs in the town we would move to. This was like two months ago, and we have t moved yet, I\u2019m not sure when we are. Like I have no one, I can\u2019t go back to my moms because of family problems, and I don\u2019t have any friends to go to. I love him so much I just blindly followed him and did what he wanted, I don\u2019t have my drivers license either so like I\u2019m just stuck, he looks and me and cuddled me like he loved me and he told me he loved me before we took a nap. I\u2019m so lost i I need help what do I do.",

And I went through his phone and all that. And I was mad at the girl first but when I saw that she just kept dodging those comments I felt relieved because she was trying to set him straight a bit",

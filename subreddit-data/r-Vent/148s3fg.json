    "postText": "I hate social media. The internet used to be fun but now it\u2019s just a cesspool of hate and entitlement. I can\u2019t post anything anywhere without someone randomly harassing for no reason. People have sucked the fun out of social media and turned it into something so fucking awful. I miss when I could make friends online. I wish people would just use the block button instead of sending you bunch of death threats just because they didn\u2019t like something you posted. Even on here I just know someone is going to comment some stupid shit. And unfortunately I have no outlet in my real life to express myself and my thoughts, and now social media can\u2019t be used as an outlet for people anymore because all people want to do all day is bully you for no fucking reason.",

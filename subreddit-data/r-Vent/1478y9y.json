    "postText": "Slight TW\n\nI was just 12 and you were 16. We met on a platform for children. This might not look like a big gap, but it was a child with daddy issues and a teenager desperate of finding an outlet. It was inhumane, but neither of us thought of that.\nGiving me all these secrets, all these problems and all these thoughts to hold onto. \nYou and I both thought I was strong enough, perhaps even 'an old soul' as they call it.\nMaybe I was just under water making it look like it was much lighter. Keeping everything so close to me, thinking I'm so strong when in reality I slowly lost the ability to breath.\nSecrets and thoughts became threats and long, long messages. \nMost of the days I begged you to keep your place here on this earth. I was a keeper. A protector. Or maybe I was just a little girl wanting some attention.\nWe both started to realize it wasn't working, the frustration, the anger, the fights, the threats. I couldn't keep it under water for much longer friend, but you kept pushing because nothing was enough for your 16 year old ego.\n\nThank you for reading. \n\nI have left this person for about a year now, after getting trough a online \"romantic\" relationship of 8 months. I feel like it ended partly because I was starting to be a person, getting my own identity, which was diffrent from his. Most days were not worth getting up for. \nThere was a lot of stuff going on next to this story, which I don't feel comfortable sharing, but feel free to ask questions anyways if you want.\nThe most important thing is that I have recovered mostly from everything that happend with him and am feeling better.\n\nRae :)",

    "postText": "I\u2019m venting.\n\nI texted him that I didn\u2019t sleep well last night, I think because I ate like half a pizza and ice cream.\n\nSince like March I have been trying to lower my carb intake but still eat high protein and just generally make better choices. It\u2019s been relatively easy and I\u2019m not hungry on a fad diet or anything but I would eat pasta for every meal if it was healthy for me. If I eat too high carb I\u2019m never full so this is just what works for me.\n\nI\u2019ve been eating this entire time mainly lean protein and veggies. And what does he reply to my text? \u201cHaha I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that, you eat something indulgent every time you leave your house!\u201d\n\nHe was just playing around but what the fuck. I\u2019ve been busting my ass over here. His comment is referring to how if I do a strenuous ride on the bike trail, sometimes I\u2019ll get pizza. Not half a pizza like last night lol, but like 1 slice and I\u2019ll have that in addition to my high protein veggie dinner.\n\nHe has never said anything like this before and usually he encourages me to eat more or have dessert or whatever. I replied \u201cyou think I eat unhealthy?\u201d And he basically backpedaled and said no, and I always make healthy meals.\n\nI\u2019m just irritated about it. Like I\u2019m about to cry.\n\nI know I look awesome. I don\u2019t have body dysmorphia or anything, I undeniably look great and am healthy. It\u2019s more that I feel unappreciated and all my work to eat healthy is unnoticed.",

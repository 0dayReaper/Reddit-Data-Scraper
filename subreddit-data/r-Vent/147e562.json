    "postText": "8 months ago I lost my oldest friend we'll call her Joy, Joy was the nicest person I've ever know she would never hesitate to give everything for someone else, laughing at pain, fear, and death.\n\nThis kind and gentle soul had to deal with a manipulative and aggressive father figure and after her parents divorce still did everything in her power to stay happy and put on a smile for whoever needed it.\n\nShe was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and for 11 months held on when she was only given 2 to live. While she could still move she would be cracking jokes, worried about others, and living life like no one else. I visited her when she could no longer walk or even stay awake, fighting with everything she had to get one more day. \n\nThe funeral was beautiful and if I could swap places with I would so it without a second thought. This beautiful, kind, and loving soul could do more good for this world then I ever could. \n\nAs a man I was forced to stand tall and be the shoulder for someone else to cry on. In the past 8 months I've talked to no one about how I was effected as I try to stand for a little longer for those who need someone to talk to. Due to past experiences prior to this chapter of my life I have grown emotionally distant, idk if I could cry if i tried... that doesn't mean I don't want to though, she was like a sister to me. I called her parents my aunt and uncle because we were that close.\n\nI miss her. She won't come back. I wish I could have done more. \n\nI hear a question I'd like to pass to you. If you were put in a room of everyone you've every met and you can only talk to one, who would you talk to?\n\nI would talk to Joy, and all of my family and friends would understand and agree with my decision because she was the kindest person in the world and she didn't deserve the brutal life she was given.",

If you think you are unable to talk to those around you; you could call a crisis support/counselling hotline, if there are any in your area. Cheaper and (hopefully) more accessible than face to face. \n\nI wish you health, happiness and longevity.",

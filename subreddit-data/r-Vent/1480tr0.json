    "postText": "I was in the bathroom at work today, getting changed to go home. I do it every day with no problem. \n\nToday, two of my co-workers tried to open the door (they didn\u2019t even knock) three times. They then proceeded to yell \u201cwho\u2019s in the bathroom?!\u201d every time they tried to open the door. As if I can\u2019t be in there. \n\nThe third time they did it, I wanted to yell at them to give me a damn minute (they had come to the door three times in a span of two minutes) but instead I very politely said \u201cSorry! Just a minute!\u201d \n\nI was only in there for about 10 minutes. \n\nCan people please have some patience?",

    "postText": "What are those dreams every night where things happen that you can't explain in words?\n\nLast night, my old friend who is no longer on this earth was there but elusive. He told me to call him, but I couldn't. In all my dreams of him there's this underlying feeling of unfinished business, but it's just in the dream.\n\nIn real life, when N was here, he was a supportive friend, gave good advice, and was good looking too if you take away the hair dye and tongue piercing. I loved what he stood for and his innocent vibe. But I couldn't love him like that because he was too unstable. He was like a big kid who was always doing stupid things. Sure, it was funny and made us all laugh, but there was a time to be serious, and even though he was when it came to his faith, he just couldn't get it together - what, with the DUI and smoking. This all from a 30-something year old virgin who wanted to wait until marriage, which is admirable, but so far from all the other things he did.\n\nHe had this dream of being a knight in shining armor. His dream girl was pure and innocent with good morals, and before he died it came out that maybe that person was me. It's just so hard to reconcile because yes, I was attracted to him, and the image was, admittingly, nice.\n\nBut it's just an ideal, not reality. I can see the potential in people and that's what I fall in love with.\n\nIf N would have been that person, maybe it would have been different, maybe not. He regretted not telling me his feelings way back years ago, but I don't think it would have made a difference. I mean, I would have been flattered, but we could have never been together.\n\nStill, when I have dreams of him, I really want to tell him I love him. Part of me wishes I were more expressive towards him when he was alive, but what good what that have done? I was married anyway, by the time his feelings came out. It's better that nothing was said. This is the one relationship where I actually kept my mouth shut for years. I know he was digging for answers from me and part of me wanted to talk about it, but it was for the best that we didn't go into it too deeply.\n\nI don't even think he thought I was pretty. He loved my personality and told me often, but he only said I was decent looking. That hurts. It's nice that he wasn't shallow and didn't even care too much about looks, but I want to be beautiful to the one who loves me. Sue me.\n\nI don't know what I'm going on about. It's just that the essence of my dreams are so other-worldly. I yearn for something I can't express. I wish I could experience great love like Noah and Allie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "postText": "Ever since I was a teen I\u2019ve been super self conscious about what I read because I was afraid people would judge me based on what I was reading. Yes I was your weird teen with vampires/fairy/immortal teen romance books so at the time they were appropriate but still felt embarrassed that I wasn\u2019t reading the \u201cnormal\u201d English class books. I\u2019d pretty much live in the library and would keep my books hidden when I wasn\u2019t there at at home.\n\nAs I grew older though my genre of books didn\u2019t change and my embarrassment of being an adult reading teen books grew. I didn\u2019t even want to go buy them at the book store cus I\u2019d always get the same judgy eyes of a 20y/o reading Percy Jackson so id order books online but eventually got too pricey and stopped reading all together. \n\nAnywho fast forward to now I finally got around to reading again! I finished my first book in almost 10 years and I was so excited to get my hands on another one. I found a recommendation through tiktok so I went to my local discount books shop and when I went to check out the cashier looks at me and frowns \u201coh and friend and I have read it and it\u2019s not good. I don\u2019t trust BookTok anymore. All the books I\u2019ve read from their recommendations suck.\u201d \n\nMy stomach dropped! I know she wasn\u2019t trying to be mean just give her opinion on the book, but I felt so embarrassed and my excitement for reading disappeared. I just felt like I did something wrong and me wanting to read this book that \u201cobviously sucks\u201d was the worst thing I could have done that day. All my teen insecurities came rushing over me and I felt lost. I didn\u2019t know what to do. Still buy it and read it? Go put it back and look for something else? Ask for her opinion? Why couldn\u2019t she just have been an average employee who rang up the book told me the price and took cash? Why did she have to be nice and try to save me from a possibly bad read? Why can I just not care what people think?! \n\nI bought the book, but I haven\u2019t been able to bring myself to pick it up and read it.",

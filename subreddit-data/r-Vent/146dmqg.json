    "postText": "Hi. I'm a 14 year old girl who lives in a small community in New York City. Just as the title suggests, I would change everything about myself if I could go back in time. See, I hate my life, I hate my body and I hate alot of people around me. I was bullied in elementary school, jumped and bullied in middle school and now that I'm in highschool, my grades are slowly slipping and I can't remember all of my classwork and I'm afraid I'm probably gonna go to summer school. I feel as though I'm an annoying person that no one wants to hangout with even though I have lots of friends. Everyday even if just one little thing goes wrong I'll blame myself and I won't get to do everything that I had put my mind too. I never told my mother about anything I had going on ever since middle school and she just thinks I'm being lazy and play to many videogames. Everyone around me thinks I'm some happy, friendly, sweet and kind girl who respects everything and I feel like I'm never gonna really live up to their expectations. My friends are the ones that truly make me happy but I feel like I'm always annoying them and that I don't belong. Sometimes when I get into arguments with my mother, she'll bring up how people my age think I'm not smart or how I'm ordinary and that will put me in a bad mode and we won't speak. To someone else all of this might seem a little much but ever since middle school, I've gotten more emotional, depressed more often, I can't take rejection and I'm a pushover. I don't know what to do and my anger is getting worse but I don't want to tell my mother about anything because then she'll get worried for me and make me worry. I just need some advice because right now I'm just telling an ai my problems.",

            "comment": "it's tough wanting to live by your parents' expectations, but it's normal. kids want approval from their parents. as someone who has been chronically depressed with an anxiety disorder, i would also never really go to my mom about things because of how overprotective she was, so i mainly grew up keeping a lot of emotions to myself to not worry her and make things a bigger deal than it is\n\nif you ever feel you could talk to her, maybe you don't have to mention what happened in school. you could mention how it's a puberty thing? which, btw, considering your age, you're starting to go through that puberty and puberty can cause emotions to be frantic\n\ni'm sorry your friends don't seem to make you feel welcome at times. they could also be going through all those emotions too due to puberty\n\nhowever, none of this excuses the bullying you have gone through, it's tough to deal with something like that, especially at your age going through puberty and all that. just know that this is a tough time to handle your emotions, but it's not impossible. recognize the emotion, where it's coming from, and a possible way to deal with that negative emotion in a healthy way. even if your mom or friends aren't available, there are many ways to help with these negative emotions\n\nhowever, again, if you do have a support group or found a support person or group eventually, definitely go to them if you can. it's always good to find other perspectives on the situation, or simply someone being there to support you\n\ndealing with bullying is very tough, but it's not the end. you got this!",

            "comment": "life is complicated for everyone.\n\nI think the biggest problem is your insecurity about everything, you probably suffer from self-sabotaging. You don't have to judge yourself so much for what you are, you simply are what you are. I imagine that another big problem for you is social approval, like many teenagers, but you don't have to worry about that because regardless of what you do, there will be people who will like it and others who will hate it. Just do what you like and live with a lighter mind\n\nI don't know to what extent this would help, but have you thought about acquiring a hobby other than your standard one? like, play the guitar, or go for a walk? You said you don't like your body (maybe that's an exaggerated opinion), have you thought about going to the gym?",

    "postText": "As the title says, I\u2019ve liked a guy for almost 6 months now. It has taken a toll on the way I feel about myself because he\u2019s never given me a definite answer. I\u2019m always left overthinking or feeling like a stupid teenager who only looks for love or relationships. I constantly started looking at the way I see myself and criticizing everything I do thinking oh this must be why he doesn\u2019t like you. Or I\u2019d think to myself, why would he even like me? I\u2019m simply out of his league. It just makes me feel really sad because I care about him a lot and I don\u2019t know how to get that across properly without pushing my feelings onto him, but I\u2019ve reached a point where I simply don\u2019t care. I\u2019m pushing him to either reject or accept my feelings because I can\u2019t keep living like this.",

    "postText": "I (22F) have been an issue for my parents since the pandemic. I wasn\u2019t doing great in school and it took a lot of doing but I finished all of my credits to graduate college this past May. The biggest problem is that some of my credits were through exam services and have not been transferred yet. I have been waiting for the exam service to fix an issue before they send the credits for evaluation. The thing that makes this worse is that my parents don\u2019t believe that I actually finished the work or that I want to graduate. I do, desperately. I can\u2019t use my car until I graduate. I can\u2019t see my friends until I graduate. I can\u2019t have a life until I graduate. But I can\u2019t until the issue is fixed. And any time I try to talk to my parents, about anything at all, I get a lecture about the fact that I\u2019m not doing enough. I might be an idiot for not being able to see this kind of issue ahead of time. I might be an idiot for not being able to find other solutions or options. All I know how to do to fix this is to call the service, which I do almost daily. I also work full time and only get a half an hour break between 9 and 5:30. I either call in the morning or during my break, but I\u2019m on hold for 20 of those 30 minutes. I am trying so hard in almost every other part of my life. I am a good daughter. I help with my grandparents. I clean. I cook. I stay out of the way. I don\u2019t make messes. But every time this gets brought up, I feel like I\u2019m nothing. I\u2019m just so freaking tired.",

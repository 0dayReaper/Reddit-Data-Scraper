    "postText": "I like to number things don\u2019t mind me. I\u2019m just so flustered with life. Today I was having such a good morning/afternoon and then it all came down. I\u2019m frustrated at so many things all of sudden. My professor is saying we can make up missed work but isn\u2019t telling us if we\u2019ll still get a penalty for it. I\u2019m having such a hard time with a class that I knew should be easy for me since I\u2019ve done something similar to already. Obviously it\u2019s my own fault that I didn\u2019t finish some assignments and I\u2019m totally fine with that but I wish he would communicate with us more. He doesn\u2019t really address specific issues unless we email him but he\u2019s been taking longer to email us back. \n\nAnd on top of that, My sister in law comes to me saying we need to take our dog to the vet when she literally has let her dog have two swollen eyes and didn\u2019t take her to the vet AT ALL. Didn\u2019t even check on her. She didn\u2019t take her to the vet after 3 days. It annoys the hell out of me when she tries to helicopter parent us because she thinks she\u2019s a dog expert. We can\u2019t take her to the vet until Saturday if we can find one that\u2019s open which she knows. And I just have a feeling that she\u2019s gonna nag my husband about it despite her barely taking care of her own dog. It\u2019s not the fact that\u2019s she\u2019s telling me, it\u2019s the fact that I myself haven\u2019t heard my dog cough or anything and she wasn\u2019t there with my dog all morning like she claims. It frustrates me. \n\nI\u2019ve been having headaches again as well. I\u2019ve been trying to sleep and I can\u2019t. My mood has been so horrific due to being pregnant and suffering with mental health issues and of course I take meds for it but I\u2019ve just been begging for therapy and haven\u2019t been able to get one. I have to wait again to see someone. I just feel like so much is happening at once.",

    "postText": "Alright. Yesterday was Sunday, and I completely forgot I had a thing to do today, so I started my evening at around 9PM where I get drunk and go on a rage-filled rampage on Apex Legends and just allow the spirt of gamer rage into my body, but at around 12PM, I suddenly remembered I had a meeting with one of my teachers today at 10AM, so I got off, calmed myself down out of panic, and just studied and studied until 3AM. \n\nI woke up slightly hungover, I still feel like throwing up right now, did my hair, got presentable, and sat down at my computer.\n\nThen 10AM came around. Then 10:15. Then 10:30. And now its 10:45.\n\nI got the email and the link to the goddamn Zoom meeting, and my teacher is nowhere to be found. The zoom link doesn't even work, and the timeslot for the meeting ends in about 10 minutes.\n\nWtf, my teacher was a no-show!!!! And this was NOT an unimportant meeting like \"Hey anon, what did you do this week?\", No! This meeting was for me to take a live test in front of him so that I can get an approval to take the real test, the deadline of which is approaching very fast, and now I have to wait until Wednesday at the very least for another meeting!!!\n\nSir, please. You're playing with my life here!!!!!! I ruined a perfectly good Sunday night and Monday morning for you to not show up!!!!!!",

    "postText": "I'm gonna start off by stating this \nMy efforts have always been a 1 way \nI do the effort no one else seems to want to do in relationships especially friendships.\n\nIt was my birthday a week ago and usually I don't get upset about people not saying or doing anything for me \n16th nothing \n18th nothing\n20th lockdown and nothing \n\nI was never upset about these particularly because I dint have friends let alone any one who actually cared in that time because my entire life revolved around studying.\nWorking harder than almost anyone  just to stay afloat.\nTrying not to have peers leave me in the dust of their own development.\n\nBut since then I've slowed down and taken some time to even out my personal life, I've gained several amazing people and lost just as many since I began working on myself rather than always trying to strive for the best because I know now I will never reach what I want it's an unhealthy and unreachable goal.\n\n3 of these friends that I've gained over the last 3 years have been the best people I've ever met and I wont trade them for anything in the world. They put effort into our friendship and actually want to have one but so so so many people that I thought cared about me didn't even wish me a happy birthday \nI could not care less about presents or parties I just want to be told that they know I'm alive and hope I'm alright and having one good day but not a single person outside of those initial 3 have wished me a happy birthday over the last 3 years \n\n21st did nothing \n22nd nothing \n23rd nothing \n\nPeople have shown me who they really are \nI am constantly told by these same people they love me and care for me but when I call they never answer when I message I get left on read for days if not weeks when I go over they never seem interested so why do they even invite me over\nOnly to be told we didn't notice or forgot entirely abd then we start it again.\n\n\"Friends\" they call themselves but can't even bother to tell me happy birthday after i have gotten them everything drove them to important events counciled them when they were struggling \nComforted them when they were heart broken but I'm barely a thought to thse people and I'm just done with them. If they can't put in effort for me after i canceled dates and missed out on events for them bit u can't even get a fucking \"happy birthday you  cunt\"",

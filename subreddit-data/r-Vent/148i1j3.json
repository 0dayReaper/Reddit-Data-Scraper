    "postText": "\n\nHi im(f) 16 and I've hated my uncle ever since i witnessed him abusing my cousins, all three of them. No one, not even one of the adults in my family would do anything!! they always think it's his way of discipline. Well I think it's bullshit, and I may have a biased opinion 'cus I'm still a kid. But I still think there's a fine line with strict discipline and just straight up abuse \n\nI've witnessed my cousins being beat up multiple times because of little things like:\nIf their grades slipped 1% they'd either get hit by a golf club at the legs or the wooden end of a broom because they weren't focusing on their studies. Which isn't even true 'cus they're always nose deep in their books, and even if their grades would slip that's only because the have to do every house chore! They cook, clean, do the laundry, feed the dogs, clean them and what does their dad do.. NOTHING!! He doesn't do shit, he just lays in his bed, in his underwear doing god knows what and if he doesn't lay around all day, he's out with his friends for the WHOLE DAYY!! Leaving his 3 daughters ALONE. AT. HOME. \n \nBut the abuse stopped when the oldest when to high school. Only because all of his daughters were honor students. I actually look up to them even the youngest one Cece she's 2yrs younger than me but she's so achieved so much more than what me and her sisters achieved at her age combined she's like the perfect child every parent dreams of. Actually all three of them, but still their father still think it's not enough. Like WTF!!!\nwhat do you mean not enough, when you we're their age you barely graduated highschool.\n\nI always thought he was a hypocrite in one way or another but what happend this year just made me hate my uncle more that i think my cousin's would be better off without him.\n \nIt was about a rumor floating around school that a 10th grade was courting Cece. And my uncle caught wind of it until eventually  everyone in our family new .\n\nI think we were 2-3 months into the school year, and our face to face classes just started when the 10th grader began courting Cece. From what I heard he would always stop by her classroom during lunch period asking where she was and if they could eat lunch together. He was doing this so often that rumors started floating. So when our family knew they started questioning me. Who was guy? Do you know him? Why didn't you tell us? They all bombarded me. and my uncle was even mad that he had to hear it from a friend and not me, the niece who goes to the same school as his daughter. \n\nAfter months i think, we all forgot about it until 3 months ago when someone at school snitched on my cousin. they saw cece with the 10th grader hugging and they took a pic, told a teacher (insinuating that they were in a relationship) who told cece's father. I don't  know what came over him but my grandma said that he went to her house told her to come with him bc they were going to the 10th graders house. After that he went back home yelled for cece who was in the kitchen with the oldest(lea 18). He barged inside and proceeded to choke Cece in the air while yelling at her . It only lasted for minutes because lea was also yelling telling him to stop or else. I guess it caught his attention 'cus he did stop, while lea proceeded to threaten him saying I was here and that my mom(uncle's oldest sister) wss coming. My mom's the only one he listens?respects? I dont know but i think he's somewhat afraid of my mom. He left after he heard my mom was coming but not before slapping cece once. My mom came she immediately went to cece and just hugged her, cece just stood there until she began crying saying \"im sorry im so sorry tita\" she didnt stop until she passed out. My mom was mad but she couldn't do anything but just be there for cece.\n\nI was mad but I was even more mad the next day cus I heard my uncle took cece to mcdonalds for her birthday gift. I was like WHAT. THE ACTUAL. FUCK!! was he really going to pretend nothing happend? I told my mom this and she just told me that maybe it's his way of apologising... WHAAATT!!!\nI wanted to argue but it was clear my mom didn't also believe the bs she just said.\n\nI'm at the edge of my sanity. Im thiss\ud83e\udd0f close to just reporting my uncle. The only reason no one is doing anything is my uncle is the reason we see my cousins and i hate it id just rather he dropdead so that my aunt can take them away atleast then he won't be able to follow them",

Then said aunt was ostracized by my family she rarely keeps contact now",

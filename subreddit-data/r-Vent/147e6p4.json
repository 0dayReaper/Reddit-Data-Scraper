    "postText": "I always try to give compliments to other girls whether they are my best friend or we only talk occasionally or sometimes have never talked at all. Sometimes girls will ignore me or others their reply will seem weird to me. I\u2019m a really sensitive person so this hurts me because I feel like I annoyed them or weirded them out. I don\u2019t really get a lot of compliments about my outwards appearance and it hurts sometimes so I try to make every other girl feel beautiful because I don\u2019t want them to go through that hurt. Whether I\u2019m close with them or not if I tell them I think they are beautiful I truly mean it. I hate how I look so much so I see so much beauty in others and I just want them to see it to. If you read this far lol do you think I should stop complimenting people to not be annoying?",

Sometimes, heck, most times, people just aren\u2019t prepared for compliments and don\u2019t know how to express gratitude (I know I do that too). Unless someone tells you to stop, or that makes them uncomfortable, etc. then just continue. One day they\u2019ll notice and give you one back, because they\u2019ll notice you and realize how good you look too.",

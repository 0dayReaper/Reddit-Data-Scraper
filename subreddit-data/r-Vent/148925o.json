    "postText": "I've never really felt happy or sad. Just completely neutral. I don't really know how to describe it. Other people seem to notice it as well. I'm never productive because I don't feel like I have a reason to be and I don't get that sense of satisfaction that others do. I just repeat the same process every day with no real purpose. It's turned me from a social person because I was raised that way to a quiet antisocial person who rarely does anything outside of what I need to do. I just keep thinking about how other people have it worse than me and how I have no reason to complain but I just needed to say something about it.",

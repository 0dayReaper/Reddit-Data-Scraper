    "postText": "I was always optimistic I kept going even when things got hard I kept going I thought I was doing this for the \"American Dream\" \n\nHonestly I have lots to be grateful for a roof, running water, and an occasionally comfortable temperatures house. I'm going for a masters degree. I'm a very lucky woman.\n\nBut I'm starting to wonder why I'm doing all this. I work, go to school, raise my kids to value education and positivity but I haven't gotten any of the things I hoped for and I feel like a failure. There's no pretty, quiet, friendly neighborhood with a white picket fence, no sweet kids for my kids to grow up with, and there never was. My son is 8, inching toward the end of his childhood every day and I have not given him the life I wanted to. The life he deserved, if I can achieve these things in the next few years my daughters childhood might be saved...at least the tail end. \n\nI wanted to give my kids better. And in some ways I do, but I'm starting to feel like its in the things that don't matter.. what good is an education when you have to claw through and still can't afford new shoes? \n\nI know, I know I'm being too hard on myself but I have never had a dream crushed. I always kept going and achieved my goals. And now I'm just feeling like I've run out of juice, there's no more push.",

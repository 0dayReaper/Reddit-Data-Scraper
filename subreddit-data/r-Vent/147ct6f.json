By then, you\u2019ve discovered more things about yourself, and realize that you\u2019d rather be a person of substance than just a pretty face. Looks fade. Eventually we all become potatoes.

If he has a major stroke, he might not be himself anymore. That happened to my mom. Talk to your dad. Ask him questions about his life. Record his voice, or take a video if he doesn\u2019t mind. Look through old pictures and remember good times. I wish it had done that with my mom before her stroke made her a different person.\n\nI wish you all the good things.",

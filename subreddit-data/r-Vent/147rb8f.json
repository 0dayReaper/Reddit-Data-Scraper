    "postText": "I don't understand what's wrong with me. Some days I feel like I can do anything and everything. I take on multiple new tasks and projects, highly motivated and excited. I go outside and get in light exercise. I happily socialise and participate in my hobbies. All this lasts for a short period of time, like a a few days to two weeks. I can only think to describe it as a sugar rush. \n\nThen comes the crash. I have no motivation, I don't want to get out of bed. I don't want to be around my own family. I don't want to do work. I consider falling back into old bad habits. My life feels like a mess and I feel completely and utterly defeated. This also lasts a few days to two weeks, a month at most, before it gets better and I feel great again.\n\nIt feels like hell and I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know how to fix it.",

            "comment": "I'd advise you to visit a therapist. Because, when it is always like this and you can see episodes, maybe it's [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder). I've got bipolar disorder myself and my life is always this cycle, i'm down in depression and can't do anything at all, then i'm getting better only to get mania.\n\nThere are different subtypes and it's individual, for some people the episodes are longer than for others, some people are rapid- and ultra-rapid-cycling with change in the mood in short times.\n\nDon't get me wrong, i hope you don't have this and you find a solution to your problems, but keep it in mind. When you can't deal with the problems, then seriously, contact a therapist and analyze it together with him.",

I recommend time limiting or straight up deleting the apps that you spend the most time on even if you don\u2019t use technology often. I definitely felt like some kind of burden was taken off my back when I deleted TikTok and other apps , and although not everyone is the same, this might help!",

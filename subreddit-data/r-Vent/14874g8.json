    "postText": "I\u2019m so sick of people pretending to like me or to want me around. I\u2019m deleting all of my social media where people I\u2019ve met through school, work, etc. follow me or I follow them (or even family members) because I\u2019m so fucking sick of seeing people hanging out and having fun without me, not even inviting me to spend time with them. I\u2019m sick of hearing \u201cwe went and did this and we had so much fun\u201d on social media and even in person. I don\u2019t even want to be friends with people or talk to anyone because people act like they like me and ignore me the rest of the time. It just reinforces my feelings of being unwanted and unimportant. It makes me not trust anyone because I wonder if they genuinely like me or if they\u2019re just tolerating me, and it makes me feel like the fucking black sheep of the family. As if being mentally ill wasn\u2019t fucking bad enough. I just want to curl up into a ball and cry myself to sleep. I don\u2019t want to see or speak to anyone. I don\u2019t want to go outside or go to work or school and pretend that I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m never okay. I feel like screaming and crying every day because I hate everything about me. I hate my broke ass brain and I hate being this fucking lonely. I hate having to go to work in an ER and constantly think about checking myself in for a psych eval. I really just wish I were never born.",

I am sorry to hear someone else is going through the same thing.\n\nBeing lonely does suck, and having to ask if you can hang out rather than being asked is such a little thing, but it means a lot. It says a lot about people when they actively want you around as opposed to only occasionally thinking of you.\n\nAnd there is nothing worse than that feeling of being left out. I do not recommend doing what I do; I self isolate. I don't go anywhere or do anything, and it makes me miserable.\n\nWhat concerns me is the self hate. It's ok to be upset at other people, but being upset with who you are is only going to make matters worse. Even though I have a lot of problems I deal with daily, I am comfortable with who I am.\n\nTry to see yourself more positively. It can make a world of difference. You may not be able to control what other people think of you, but you can control how you see yourself.\n\nI hope that helps, and if you decide to check in for an evaluation, I hope you are able to find what you need.\n\nHang in there!",

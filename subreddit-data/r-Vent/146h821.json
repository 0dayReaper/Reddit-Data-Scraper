    "postText": "This started happening in 2021 - present year.\n\nBefore, my mom used to record windows and walls, she used to say that the walls were moving, shadows in the windows, and that the door locks were unlocking by their self. My stepmom and brother said that they see nothing paranormal or something weird. Sometimes I will be watching TV with her in the living room and she sees me zoned out (note that I have ADHD)  then she'll ask \"What's going on?\" Or \"Do you see something weird?\" I'll always say no. Fast forward to August 2021 my mom and my stepmom broke up it was just me my brother and my mom. My mom would go to my brothers room and scold him about how his friends are spying on her.\n\nMy brother moved in April 2022 out because he had enough of her bullshit, so it was just me and her. Then fast forward to May 2022, we were supposed to move in with her new girlfriend but they started arguing then they broke up I guess. A day after that, I came home from school and she was saying that her ex drove me back home but she doesn't even live near us she lives in Akron. Then randomly started saying that I was doing meth with her, she showed me a random video of our pantry and there's literally nothing there. Then fast forward to June-July she would start to destruction the house, using a hammer to break the walls, she started saying she wanted to kill her other ex (the one she broke up with in August)\n\nI used to go to my room and cry while this happened because I didn't know why or what was happening. She broke my phone back in May so I had no one to text, I was only 14. August ex tried to take custody of me but that didn't work at all. It all went on and on until she got money to take me to my grandma's.\n\nShe is on testosterone right now but I don't even know what to call her anymore, I didn't know if I even love her anymore. But it's still going on right now and I don't know what to do anymore.\n\nSome other things she used to say while this was going on \"You're smoking meth in the walls\" or her ex sexually assaulted me. Honestly I don't know if she's mentally ill or on drugs or something but that was ridiculous the worst year of my life is definitely 2022. At this point I don't know if I can love her anymore",

            "comment": "You are right; something is going on. If you have never seen your mom do drugs, or even suspected, I would guess mental illness. Is there a relative you can call to help you? Do you have insurance or know where she goes to the doctor?\n\nOther than testosterone, is she taking anything? Is she taking testosterone to transition or another reason?\n\nCan you ask someone at school  to intervene like a counselor?",

DISGUSTING PERVERTS\n\nEdit: I probably won\u2019t be reacting to any more comments but before you go off, I was specifically venting about people sexualising the act of a child being breastfed - and I have seen people compare breastfeeding to e.g. public masturbation, because they think it\u2019s \u201cequally as inappropriate\u201d. You don\u2019t have to look particularly hard to find people with these opinions, this is fucking Reddit. This post wasn\u2019t intended to shame anyone with a lactation or adult breastfeeding kink. \n\nIf you see a person breastfeeding in public, just fucking ignore it. They\u2019re not doing it for you, for society or the male gaze - they\u2019re doing it for their child.",

Due to movies, tv shows, video games and other forms of media have made it so that when there are boobs exposed on screen, more than likely it\u2019ll be used for a sex scene, so it can make some people uncomfortable, thus leading to seeing a real breast in public, even though it\u2019s to feed a baby, they freak out.",

You'd have to be a depraved, gross lunatic to see a woman breastfeeding a baby and find it hot. But, I've never even heard of anyone that fetishizes that. I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but I've never heard of it or seen anyone express it. \n\nEspecially the creepy, specific detail they mentioned where people they specifically fantasize about the baby doing an act on them instead of the tit, which is hideously specific and horrifying to imagine. But, again, I've never heard of that being a thing, so where OP discovered multiple people with this wildly disgusting fetish is beyond me. \n\nI think you took the post as them saying that fantasizing about sucking a woman's breasts at all is gross, which it is not. It is a strange duality where it's a way to feed a baby as well as a foreplay for adults, but I think you were mistaken and OP randomly raged at a heinous, depraved fetish that I didn't even know was a thing and wish I didn't hear.\n\nYou thought that OP meant that sucking tits",

                                    "comment": "Idk what information you're basing that statement on, but I'm going off the countless accounts of anthropologists that have found evidence of general human horniness &amp; sexual shenanigans that match or even exceed modern proclivities, from cultures &amp; civilizations across the globe, stretching back thousands of years. I say exceed in some ways, due to the  modern day ubiquity of purity culture, sexual taboo &amp; shaming, primarily in the west, but also in  many other parts of the world, that MAYBE have put a small dent for a hit minute in the numbers of human getting it on. \n\nHuman sexuality has always been a part of our nature, and while certainly modern technology seems to highlight that &amp; offer data on it on an unprecedented &amp; massive scale, to look at this new wealth of information about sex &amp; desire and assume that the sheer quantity of data represents some kind of sexual deviancy epidemic is just fallacious reasoning &amp; bad science. That and the current size of the human population is also at astronomical levels, which in turn also contributes to this illusion that human horniness &amp; \"depravity\" is at an all-time high. \n\nThat's like the inverse of seeing that the statistics of hunger (for example) of a population are at an all time low at 10%, and compared to last century's data showing 20% of the population is starving and so that must mean that fewer humans than ever are going hungry, so that must be good news! But that neglects to take into account that 10% of hungry people represent a potion of a population that's increased 10 fold over the last 100 years, as compared to the size of the same population numbers 100 years ago. \n\nIE if 20% of 1000 people were starving 100 years ago, then that means 200 people were starving back then. Compare that to 10% of a modern population of 10,00 that is considered to be starving, that 10% actually comes out to 1000 starving people, way more than the mere 200 put of 1000 that were hungry 4 generations ago. Statistically, the numbers have gone down, but quantitatively the opposite is true.\n\nSo that same kind of cognitive incongruity occurs if you try to compare human sexual behavior from today to the very different circumstances of humans being sexual even 100 years ago. Just because there are a lot more humans around, doesn't mean that for some reason humans have gotten more randy than ever. In fact, the two data points really have little correlation or relevance to each other. \n\nAnother example is assuming that there are less virgins today than 100 or 500 years ago because premarital sex has seemingly been on the rise. That's a false assumption on two points: one, because like I've referenced earlier, humans have always been enthusiastically knocking boots for far, far longer than the very modern concepts of \"marriage\" &amp; premarital sex have been around, and two, that assumption also fails to take into account the huge boom in human population.\n\nVirgins were far rarer back in the day ,not because more people were still having sex, but because there were just a lot less people alive back then. If only 1% of humans today are \"virgins\", then that comes out to 80 MILLION virgins today. 100 years ago that same percentage would've been a mere 20 million. \n\nGiven all the historical &amp; anthropological evidence that people have been consistently having sex 24/7 for all of human existence, the only thing that's changed, is again, the sheer scale, that creates this illusion that humans have somehow becomes mindless sex addicts across the board.\n\nIf anything, the opposite yet equally false assumption could be made about humans if you were to look at the hypothetical virginity numbers I already gave you, Sam's context &amp; nuance\n\nIE If there are 4 times the number of virgins today than there were 100 years ago, then that can only mean humans are having less sex than ever! It's a crisis!\n\nYeah, no, that's not what's actually happening.",

Say a type of incapacitating illness (mental or otherwise) develops out of a mutation; if left to natural selection, individuals bearing that mutation would most likely fail to pass their genes on, and thus the disease would die down. It's the very fact that we can care for our sick, treat their illness, and provide them with a chance to live relatively normal lives, that allows genetic diseases to live on. 'Cause, you know, the alternative at this point would be killing (or sterilizing) them all.\n\nBesides that, I wonder why you even think *this specific trait* would have been naturally selected. What exact advantage would our ancestors have in picking large-breasted mates? There's no connection (as far as I'm aware) between breast size and, say, resilience, fertility, or even lactation. \n\nAnd again, as OP already stated, it stands to reason that, if big breasts had been naturally selected as advantageous back in prehistory, all women would be well endowed today. The core of your argument makes no sense.",

When I think about breastfeeding my future child in public,it's a clear no.I could use baby formula on that day,or pump my own milk  in bottles and damn,the child won't die if it doesn't get my breast all the time lol.Imo,it should be allowed to breastfeed in public but the mom should cover up her boobs with a blanket or this special breastfeeding clothing at least.I don't think this is so much to ask for and it's a compromis.The one side gets to feed their child and the another one won't be flashed,forced to see something they don't want to. It's a public space and I think it is deeply inappropriate to put your boobies out without covering them.Why must it be in the middle of a coffee shop?!?Like,as if it would be so hard to go to the restroom for that for a few minutes.",

I am one of those people. That type of \u201cculture\u201d makes it shameful to be a woman, literally saying you need to cover up because your body is a temptation/wrong/dirty/inappropriate/only here to be objectified. Why don\u2019t men have to \u201ccover up?\u201d That hypocrisy is demeaning and that line of thinking shouldn\u2019t be around in this day and age. \n\nIf YOU are uncomfortable breastfeeding without running to a restroom or smothering your baby with a blanket, that is perfectly fine. Literally no one is saying that\u2019s wrong. \n\nThe point is women  should have a choice to not do it (like you) or do it without people being stupid and gross about it. As in, literally look away and mind your business like you were just a few seconds ago before you\u2019re eyes briefly landed on the mom and her kid.\n\nNo one is being flashed anything. All they\u2019ll probably see, if they\u2019re looking THAT hard (which they shouldn\u2019t be), is boob skin that you\u2019d typically see in regular women\u2019s clothes that show cleavage.",

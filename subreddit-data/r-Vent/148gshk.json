    "postText": "When I was really young in daycare, (around 4-6yrs old) i was sexually assaulted in a public bathroom, I told staff at the daycare what happened to me immediately after but they did nothing, not even inform my parents. That daycare shut down a long time ago now and i\u2019ve never been more glad. I then grew up with the idea that sexual attention was better than no attention so i joined various online servers at around age 8-13, in which i talked to people much older than me with bad intentions. \n\nAt age 14 i then got into a relationship in which i experienced what i felt was love for the first time ever. I trusted him with my virginity and after about two months, he coerced me into doing things i didn\u2019t want to and sexually assaulted me. I reported it to the police and got a restraining order out of fear of what he would do to me. \n\nI suffer with PTSD from all i experienced and i\u2019m heavily medicated with antidepressants and anti-psychosis medication. It\u2019s completely destroyed my relationship with sex, i\u2019m terrified of it and feel horrible about my lack of sex drive. I think I might be asexual but i\u2019m not sure.",

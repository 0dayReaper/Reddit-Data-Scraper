    "postText": "I got my cat a few months ago and he REFUSES to keep my door closed. It doesn\u2019t lock so when I close it he just pushes it alllll the way open. I wouldn\u2019t mind him staying in my room but he gets mad the second I close the door and pisses all over my things. I\u2019m cat piss phobic so I avoid that at all costs. My sisters room is directly across the hall so if she were to get up at any point, I\u2019m caught. My sister can be a real judgmental prude (I love her but it\u2019s true) and even though we are both grown ass women, she would never let me live it down if I got caught in the act. I hate to be graphic but I can\u2019t even get wet enough to do it anymore bc I\u2019m so paranoid that either she\u2019s going to walk in or my cat is going to piss on my stuff. I think this might be the most infuriating shit that has ever happened to me. My pussy and I are fully depressed at this point.",

Pissing everywhere too. With a bit of training you can usually break them of the habit by making them feel comfortable. Its probably because shes in a new place and shes scared and stressed. Or because she's a kitten, they're little shits in general. \n\nFor a short term solution try masterbaiting in the bath. Cat won't mess with you when you're in the bath.

Depending on what you use, and how much one can hear outside the bathroom, that already could be a solution, but if you only have one bathroom, and you have to keep it short and can't, then this isn't really it.\n\nNumber two: Well, find a way, so you can pretty much come by thought. You don't have to touch your self, don't need porn, but just your imagination. I'd be honest tho, it's not that easy, when you don't know how to do that, what you like, what gets you horny the fastest and so on.\n\nNumber three: Use the method with the cat door",

Maybe a full laundry basket or a box from your closet. Something like that so he can\u2019t push the door. Then move it away when your done with your business. If your sister just busts in your room with the door shut you have bigger issues lol but if she notices it\u2019s shut and barricaded just tell her your cat pissed on the floor so he lost privileges to your room lol. Since you said your cat *pushes* the door I\u2019m assuming it opens to the inside.",

The idea of getting rid of the cat altogether popped in my head but without knowing more I suppose that sounds a bit extreme, maybe have someone babysit it for some time. As someone who has to, well, rub one out now and then and is mostly living with family and sharing room with my brother, I would say either use the bathroom or when your sister is out or better yet at night when your sister is asleep. A blanket over you, if you can, helps just in case someone comes in. And someone pointed out a different door so I guess that's a good idea too but that's about it.",

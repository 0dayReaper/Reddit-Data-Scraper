I was born with a medical condition. Severe hormonal and physical malformations does not make me transgender. I live in the great yeehaw hate state of Texas, and I get harassed on a daily basis. I\u2019ve had glass bottles thrown at me, my car keyed, and food thrown at me because they hate transgender people, and then when I very angrily tell them it\u2019s a medical issue, they tell me to fix myself. There is literally nothing wrong with me???? I was just born differently??????? I fucking hate people.",

You\u2019re close enough so they feel just as comfortable harassing and attacking you as they would anyone else cause they\u2019ve already convinced themselves it\u2019s \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d or \u201cgod\u2019s will\u201d or whatever. Hate doesn\u2019t discriminate by technicalities, it\u2019s a wide net, and they don\u2019t care who gets caught so long as it\u2019s not them. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re caught in it tho. It\u2019s unfair and extremely difficult to find a solution to.",

People that find time during their day to be consumed with hate about something that in no way impacts their lives have other issues. Insecurity and self-loathing are a couple of causes. They\u2019re unhappy with themselves and their lives, and they feel the need to blame someone or something else for their own perceived shortcomings. What better target than a marginalized group of people? \u201cEasy targets\u201d in their simple minds.\n\nDedicating your free time to congregate with like-minded angry people, trying to intimidate participants at a Pride Parade, is quite pathetic. Especially given the fact that they cover their faces while doing so. Half the reason they probably cover their faces is because they don\u2019t like looking at themselves in the mirror. Sad!",

If you\u2019re a person of color the areas you travel to are important to consider. Even 30 minutes inland from where I live it\u2019s more outwardly racist. City by city and state by state, like anywhere, it really depends on where you\u2019re going. Things are very bad here, even though many of us don\u2019t witness violence frequently. It\u2019s kind of a creeping, hidden danger, you know it\u2019s there and you\u2019re always aware if it, but it is unusual to actually witness a violent crime (depending on where you live). \n\nAs a woman I don\u2019t feel safe at night and am sexually harassed in my small town depending on what I wear. When I go to the grocery store there\u2019s always the fear that there could be a shooter, even thought I\u2019ve never been in a shooting. America is beautiful. We have incredible natural ecosystems. If you\u2019re a white foreigner traveling with a friend or two, you are at much, much lower risk. America is most dangerous for people of color, marginalized religions, and LGBTQ.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to travel here, but be cautious, it\u2019s not irrational. I think foreigners sometimes underestimate how massive and culturally diverse the USA is. Make some online friends now so when you travel in the future you have people who are comfortable with the culture :)",

I think what made me completely abandon the idea of binary was when a friend explained that if someone is born intersex, or with some \u2018defect\u2019, or just something not \u201cnormal\u201d the immediate response is to \u201cfix it\u201d. She explained that\u2026 wasn\u2019t it natural if you were born that way? And I just sat back and thought for a minute that she was right. That\u2019s like to say people born with autism need to be \u201cfixed\u201d rather than learn to accommodate their needs. Obviously if you have health issues related to your condition\u2026 get those checked out. But if you\u2019re overall healthy\u2026 who cares?\nI\u2019m so sorry though however that people treat you like that.

Intersex folks come under their own umbrella (it's the I in LGBTQIA+)\nEssentially Intersex folk are born with genetic differences that give varying levels of attributes of both chromosomal sexes. Trans folk are *generally* born with a single chromosomal sex that is different from their gender identity.\n\nMy brother has Klienfelders, born with XXY chromosomes. He presents as male and identifies as male. He is still genetically intersex. His physical appearance matches his gender identity. He would never identify as Trans. From a discrimination perspective, he's lucky that no one would ever know. He didn't even know until he was in his 30s and had some genetic testing done.\n\nBut there are lots genetic variations that mean someone who is Intersex can present in many different ways. Unlike Trans folk, who may use make up, hormones etc to change their appearance to match their indentity, Intersex folk might get (as an example) breasts and facial hair naturally. \n\nOP,  I'm sorry you're going through this. No one should have to put up with this nonsense. Nothing makes me madder than idiots spouting nonsense around \"there are only 2 genders\". They obviously didn't listen in biology \ud83d\ude44",

I'm sorry this happens to you but just think of what it means for real trans people and the dangers they face every day. Some intersex individuals do identify as trans, that's up to the individual. I understand why you are upset but please try not to let this impact how you feel about transgender people. \n\nI will reiterate: There is nothing wrong with transgender people, either.",

You just assume I dislike the community because you read the title and couldn\u2019t be bothered to read the first sentence. My problem is not with the transgender community, my problem is with the people who assume I\u2019m in it and treat me like I am transgender, when I personally only see my condition as it is. A medical condition. Many intersex people also turn to the trans/lgbtqia+ community for support and guidance on how to navigate life being hated by a big portion of society, but intersex people also face their own challenges outside of the community. People get labeled as hermaphrodites and ridiculed especially by medical professionals, people who are just desperately searching for medical aid being taken advantage of, and being so overly sexualized that there\u2019s mass groups of people who actively search out intersex people to assault. I know trans community faces the same problems, but it\u2019s different when we never had a choice to transition, most people are forcefully \u201cfixed\u201d at birth and without consent of the individual. Some intersex people live their childhood never knowing what atrocities the medical professionals who wrongfully changed them until puberty, and suddenly the hormonal differences start tearing their body apart. And that\u2019s only one situation, there are so many different variations and sub variants that it\u2019s so incredibly difficult to get basic information on your own body. \n\nI understand the trans community has horrific struggles, but so does the separate intersex community.",

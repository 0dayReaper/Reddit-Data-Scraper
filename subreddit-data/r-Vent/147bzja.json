    "postText": "A few years back, I was living a dream for myself. I had my own place had a solid job (hated it but pay was great). I was living a single man\u2019s dream. Had a new car that I really liked. I was motivated, I was working out, had a good group of friends. Then I had met this girl, I fell very hard for her. I did everything I possibly do to help her. She was trying to leave her baby daddy; he was a douche. Constantly cheated on her, abused her (both mentally and physically), he even tried to baby trap her. Well we were talking for a few months and hanging out all that stuff. So I gave her the option to move in with me, with her son. She took me up on that offer and when her baby daddy (BD from now on) went to work I helped her gather her stuff and she lived with me. She was working and it wouldn\u2019t have been that long so it was only so she could save money and get a better job since her BD hated her having a job. I thought things were going well, she stayed with me for about two weeks come find out she was sleeping with her BD and she essentially did the same thing to me as to BD. At first I didn\u2019t really care she left. I tried my best, that\u2019s all I could really do. She left me on a Friday she married him that Monday at the courthouse. I was upset and heartbroken but it wasn\u2019t all that bad. But it did create some major trust issues for me and made it to where I can\u2019t trust nearly anyone, but that\u2019s not what this is about. My cousin (I say cousin but I\u2019m 100% closer to him than my brother) had said he was worried about me since I had basically stopped doing anything with our friends and just kinda turned into a robot. He was having problems at his house with his mom and dad. So he asked if he could move in with me. I cleared it with my landlord and he didn\u2019t mind since my cousin had a really good job and was trustworthy. We had a good time for awhile and then we had a big fight (I don\u2019t remember what it was about but I\u2019m sure it was stupid, it\u2019s been awhile) some hurtful things were said on both sides. An once he left it\u2019s like whatever magical dam I had built in my head just collapsed. I turning into a raging alcoholic, stopped working out, lost my job, started doing drugs was doing my damndest to keep a gun out of my mouth. An I\u2019ve been bullied all my life from anyone willing to throw an insult at me. But I think hearing it from someone I cared about that much just destroyed me. On top of losing the girl I was in love with along with her son that I loved too. Plus a job I truly hated and was barely holding the motivation to keep in the first place. Just made me stop caring. I couldn\u2019t keep up my happy facade. My landlord was a nice guy and let me stay wayyy longer than he should have and I do appreciate that compassion. But I had to leave eventually, so I had lost my home too. Then, I had started gaining weight when my grandma let me move in since I was to depressed to keep my mouth hole shut around snack. I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201dm and I had got up to 320. Then my aunt whom I was very close to passed away from OD which admittedly made me never wanna go near drugs again. But on the flip side I had started getting my life together, good job lost about 150 pounds, started working out again, stopped smoking, and drinking. My trust issues never got better, and neither did my social anxiety from being isolated for so long. But it didn\u2019t last cause I messed it up, I found a new job I thought I\u2019d like (plot twist hated it) got demotivated started drinking again. But I thought I could push through it and come on top, then one of my childhood friends killed himself which admittedly we weren\u2019t as close as we were when we were kids but it still hurt ya know? Which basically sent me back to square one, I\u2019ve at least managed to keep the weight off and stay away from the drugs. But it just seems like every time something goes wrong in my life, my head brings me back to when I was curled up in a ball with a bottle in my hand in my trailer alone. I genuinely don\u2019t know how to get over that and it\u2019s been about 4 years since then. But I just can\u2019t keep myself motivated cause I\u2019m just back in my living room every time something goes wrong. Sorry this is such a mess, I\u2019m terrible with storytelling and grammar. Thanks for reading!\n\nEDIT: there\u2019s far more things, that had happened during this time, but I felt like this post was getting a bit to long and my phone was lagging really bad O I tried to hit all the high points.",

It\u2019s no big deal for them and could be a night and day difference for your daily outlook. There are literally thousands of different meds for depression out there, give it a shot you don\u2019t have anything to lose and everything to gain. \n\nYou absolutely should not put up with feeling that the world is caving in on you.",

Hydroxoxine (can't spell it as well) didn't do anything either. \nMy zoloft dose is way to low as well. They got me on 25mg for a week then up to 50mg. \nMy gf is on it as well and she's on like 250 so 50 just seems weak. Not yryna compare but we both suffer long term depression but my anxiety is far higher so I don't see 50 cutting it.",

    "postText": "I know it sounds bad but it's not what it looks like. My boyfriend and I have been long distance for about four years. We've visited one another and I can say he treats me far better than anyone ever has. (Even if the bar wasn't exceedingly low, by normal standards he is a saint)\n\nHe loves me in spite of my faults, tells me how beautiful and smart he thinks I am constantly, and is always trying to spoil me. But I just don't feel the same. I don't know if something is broken in me, but I feel like I don't have enough to give in return. He adores me but the thought of living with someone and relying on them for anything makes me want to run away screaming.\n\nHe is my best friend, and I want the world for him. But I'm just not that attracted to him. Hell some days I wonder if I even want to be with a man. But I also know myself and know that if this doesn't work out I won't put the effort in to get into a relationship. I dragged my heels the whole way into this one. I never wanted to be more than just friends, but he wore me down and I do love him more than anyone else.\n\nI'm just genuinely unhappy. I hate my job, I live alone and have no friends locally. My family has been emotionally and mentally abusive my entire life and I hold them at arms length as much as I can to protect myself. \n\nThey say to love someone you have to love yourself, but I absolutely despise me. Every part of myself repulses me and I don't see that changing any time soon. Therapy and medications never changed that, and just made the poor treatment I lived under for years blurry enough to ignore until I could strike out on my own.\n\nI don't have any redeeming qualities and it drives me up the wall that he won't even accept it whenever I try to break it off. I just wish he would let me go so he can have something better, instead of waiting for me to be capable of something I'm not. I'm empty. I have nothing to offer anyone else. I just want him to move on.",

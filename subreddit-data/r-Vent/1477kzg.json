    "postText": "i\u2019ve always struggled with my weight, i was a chubby kid, regularly called fat, mostly every single person i\u2019ve dated or been in a talking phase has \u201cjokingly\u201d called me fat, my current boyfriend comments on my weight a lot as a joke, he says he wouldn\u2019t say it if i actually was fat, i don\u2019t believe that and when i say stuff about me feeling big or \u201cfat\u201d he\u2019ll shout at me as if he doesn\u2019t call me fat so often. i don\u2019t know what to even believe. i know i\u2019m bigger ish but i do fluctuate a lot between stone every couple months, i get jealous when my boyfriend comments on other women just calling them hot or even when i look on his twitter likes and see a girl with a perfect body and i can\u2019t help but feel so upset and jealous of these people, it makes me feel undesirable. \n\ni went through extreme body dysmorphia last year and i couldn\u2019t even bring myself dragging myself to my one and only prom because i couldn\u2019t stand the thought of people looking at my body even if they were just looking at my dress, i regret not going and that i let my brain have that power over me. when i lost quite a bit of weight not long later, people would comment on how skinny i had gotten and i looked good, i had been restricting my eating, it fed into my bad eating habits, reinforced it as good behaviour when it was making me sick and months later i was constantly getting ill because it was making my body and immune system weaker, over the 7-8 months since then i\u2019ve gained all the weight back on from predominantly steroids (i had to take from falling ill)\n\neven when i was \u201cskinny\u201d i hated how i looked and i didn\u2019t even notice how small i\u2019d gotten until i gained the weight back, i would still cry at the sight of my body. i just want to feel skinny again but even when i am \u201cskinny\u201d my brain even process i am. i just want to be happy within my skin but doesn\u2019t matter if i\u2019m \u201cskinny\u201d or back to \u201cfat\u201d someone always makes a comment on my weight. my mum, my friends, my boyfriend whether it\u2019s negative, positive or \u201ca joke\u201d it all hurts. it\u2019s exhausting feeling like this. i\u2019ve started hating other women, i\u2019m being fucking misogynistic to other women like how pathetic can i get?? i\u2019m bisexual why am i beginning to HATE other peoples bodies for looking amazing, it\u2019s disgusting and i\u2019m disgusted at my behaviour. i just wish i could stop crying over my weight. i hate going on tiktok and seeing these people with perfect bodies, it frustrates me, i feel sick at my own mindset but i just feel so insecure and upset. \n\nIf you read this and can relate to how i feel, i know how exhausting this feels and you\u2019re not alone, i bet you\u2019re beautiful and i hope we can feel content with our bodies one day, it\u2019s just an outer shell, it shouldn\u2019t mean anything &lt;3",

I use to feel this way around age 13 but my confidence grew to were I wasn\u2019t comparing myself to others as much around the age of 17, now that I\u2019m in my early 20s It\u2019s sprung up again all of a sudden. It\u2019s so hard to escape this feeling of she looks better or I wish I looked like her. I wish people like your boyfriend for example would be more mindful of what they say. I wish my family members would realize that comments on my body hurt me no matter if they are intended to be positive. I can relate to taking some of my feeling out on how other women look, it\u2019s a vicious cycle.",

You don't have to love yourself. I was in the exact same position as you. I lost a ton of weight from a cancer scare, but I received so many compliments I started to think maybe cancer wouldn't be the worst thing. CANCER! \n\nSofies book was the beginning for me, I only bought it because she's my favourite comedian but then it all started to make sense and really help. You don't have to love yourself but you don't have to hate yourself either. It's taken me 4 years, I've had a baby, I was fat before, little bit fatter now and that's fine! Your body being fat is the least important thing about you.\n\nI'm sure you're a kind, funny, considerate wonderful human being! Please check out some fat positive/body positive Instagram's, books, anything! You got this x",

Whether it was positive or negative I told them that my body isn't up for discussion, thank you next.",

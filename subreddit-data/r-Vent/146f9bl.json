    "postText": "I work a very boring job that consists of basically standing in 1 spot for 8 hours but I've been doing it the last 3 years and I've become very comfortable with the job itself and my coworkers. That being said I feel very comfortable being myself around them but sometimes I feel like I'm annoying everybody. Nobody has ever made off hand comments or passive aggressive comments toward me or anything but when I say something or act a little weird I can't help but to think about what my coworkers were thinking in that moment and how annoyed they probably were with me. I've become fairly paranoid, I feel like people get tired of me and ignore me or tune me out because I'm annoying but  when I keep quiet or act more reserved it also doesn't make me feel well about myself either. It's not just my job either. In elementary school I was convinced that I was mentally disabled because at my school nobody really hung out with the mentally disabled kids and I thought that was why nobody ever talked to me or wanted to hangout with me.",

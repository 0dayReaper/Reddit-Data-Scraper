I've started recovering from severe malnutrition due to anorexia, and now I'm starting to actually feel emotions (positive and negative). \nMy ex keeps popping up in my mind, and even though she literally made me want to &gt;!slit open my throat!&lt; , I'm realising that I'll always really fucking love her and never will love anyone else like I do her..\n\nIs this just my emotions coming back or do I just hate myself and need to find a new way to harm myself since I have to stop restricting my food intake?? \nWeird. Very weird.",

The right answer is to not go back and instead pursue those positive emotions in other ways. Speed date, do things you love, really spend time for yourself and keep a journal of the things you love, hate, and want to explore. Don\u2019t tie yourself down, you\u2019ll never get out if you do.",

This is why having the right support helps out a lot. Whether it be a therapist or your family, as long as someone can remind you of what\u2019s good. But I don\u2019t blame you, and I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s like that.",

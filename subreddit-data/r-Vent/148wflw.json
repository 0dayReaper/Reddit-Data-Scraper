    "postText": "Bruh I\u2019m literally 18 now and my mom still has tech restrictions on me like a child. I can\u2019t do anything about cuz she genuinely backs up her punishments when I disobey her and it\u2019s fucking annoying. \n\nI have a job, my own car, my own responsibilities, but she she thinks k can\u2019t handle my own technology, wtf?! How does that make sense? Why can\u2019t we just move past the childish stuff and let me be my own person. \n\nIt\u2019s sounds fucking stupid but I just wanna have the time to spend time with my friends on games and shit, and have that time to myself with my electronics (that I lauded for myself) when I need it. But no, all my shit has to visible in her vision at all times, why?! I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I reached the point where all my friends are going to start leaving me again cuz we\u2019re all starting life, we can stay connected through games and shit, but I won\u2019t be able to cuz of these fucking rules. I\u2019m not asking for the world, if I am I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m just annoyed anxious that I\u2019m gonna loose all the friends I enjoy spending my life with cuz I can\u2019t have the same technology privileges as other people my age. I\u2019m sick of loosing people cuz I can\u2019t participate in what there doing, I try my best to be a part of what they want so I don\u2019t get left out and forgotten about, I don\u2019t want that cycle to keep repeating, I just want to be apart of my friends lives and technology and games is the way I can do that, I don\u2019t wanna be lonely again after everything I\u2019ve done to get away from it.",

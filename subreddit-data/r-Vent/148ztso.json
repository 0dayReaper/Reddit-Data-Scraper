    "postText": " Recently I was contacted by someone that I used to speak to when I was 13-16. I have a lot of trauma I blocked out from that time and I barely remembered him. He said something that triggered me and brought it all back. I feel like I'm drowning and I have to let it out. I feel I cant speak about this to anyone. Not being able to vent it to the ones I love though is tearing me apart inside. So here goes.\n\nI was a very timid and shy girl back then. I was extremely introverted and always shut myself in playing game or browsing the internet. I had made an online profile on an old social media site to connect with other teens. For the most part I was conversing with other teens but then I started talking to older guys in their late teens and from there it turned sexual. I was always open to talking to and being sexual with older guys but with discretion. I just thought I was so desired and beautiful. I didnt realize I was being preyed upon by monsters. I was very lonely and unable to form any meaningful friendships with my peers and I realize now how easily I was manipulated. It wasnt just 1 guy who groomed me it was multiple but hes one I distinctly remember.\n \n From what i vaguely remember this guy was 17 when we started talking and he would flirt with me and call me beautiful. He had a gf but he would always call me his secret gf. He'd always say nice things to me and I was very attracted to him. He would send me explicit pictures and I never reciprocated but he would always do stuff like that and exposed me to a bdsm dynamic. He would slowly over the time get me to do things like masturbating for the first time which progressed to going  school without underwear and other nasty stuff like that. He would always say that when I was older he would make me his gf and I'd go live with him. There was a point where I was really considering going to live with him and be his slave or whatever. I thought I was in love with him. I would do whatever he asked without sending pics but letting him know.\n\n When I was 16 I got sick of him and all the other creeps I was talking to. I finally came to my senses and decided to block all these guys and threaten to tell my parents and tell them everything if they wouldnt leave me alone. I was sick of being a play thing and being valued for being young and a virgin. I broke up with him and the other creeps who only valued my virginity. I lost my virginity when I was 17 just so that he and the other ones would stop desiring me and I thought that was over. Until he contacted me recently and opened up these old wounds. I immediately blocked him after calling him a slew of curse names and unleashing years of rage I had for those creeps.\n\n I've been screaming and crying when I'm alone remembering my young naive self doing things for these men preying on me before I came to my senses and deleted everything and blocked all of them. I began isolating from my friends and family with all this pain that has come back trying to deal with. To have this jerk reach out to me and say things just triggered a wound that i never healed only blocked out. I never wanted to remember those things. I'm just trying to rebuild myself and go forward with the knowledge of how I was groomed and how when I came to my senses it was too late. The damage was done and I never dealt with it but heres hoping that by finally letting it out so that I can heal my inner child. My inner rage and sadness needs to be released but with venting about it I hope I can work my way into moving on and healing from this at last. \n\n Thank you for reading you have. I'm going to be okay but I just need to not be okay right now.",

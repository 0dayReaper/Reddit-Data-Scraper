    "postText": "So I\u2019m not going to share too much about my personal life cause I don\u2019t feel comfortable doing so, but for reference me and my brother are in late high school and in an extra curricular. I\u2019ve tried to make friends with people there before, but it just doesn\u2019t work. And it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want more friends cause the freshman are friends with all of them. They will schedule events and I will be the only person not invited. I can walk into a room and say something and people ignore like I\u2019m not even there. I\u2019m just sick of it",

The friends I had left never invited me out to anything and would always have an excuse to not come if I invited them out. Maybe try with other people or find a hobby that includes a group of people",

This may or may not be something you can control, but if it is, then you'll at least have a way to try and fix the situation, if you're willing to.  Unfortunately sometimes people are simply annoying by their nature without intending to be, and it's not their fault, and I can only imagine how isolating that would be.  I would want to know the truth even if it were hurtful to me.",

    "postText": "Hey guys so, I just had an exam a couple of days ago. I feel really neglected within my family unit. I live in a different city and nobody really seems to ask about me...I get it though, because apparently I'm supposed to be the 'strong one', or 'the normal one', or so my mom would want me to believe. I feel like my struggles aren't validated at all, unless I visibly look like I'm in danger.\n\nI came to stay for a few days, where my mom lives. I don't feel like I'm really asked about how I'm doing, or at least focused on, and given attention to in that way. It hurts all the more because when I was struggling with depressive episodes I was really hurt to be yelled at for it.\n\nToday I was fixing up a real butterfly and my little sister walked in the room. I was extremely excited to tell her about it, and, with her back faced towards me, just said 'yes' twice &amp; left. I expressed my frustration on the matter clearly but I'm still hurt, because she didn't make any effort to hang out after that.",

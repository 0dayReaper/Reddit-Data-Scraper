    "postText": "I 21 F have been working at a grocery store for about 2 months now since April 11th of 2023. Working here isn\u2019t fun anymore, i liked my job at first but now I\u2019m getting b*tched at and it\u2019s killing me. I asked for the phone to do a floor sweep (we have to scan a QR codes around the store) and G got mad and said there\u2019s no cares outside. I said I would do them after I swept and I did. I went to go on my break and G looked outside and said there\u2019s only 6 or 7 carts they won\u2019t last. There was more then that. So I got more carts and went on my break. I would also like to mention floor sweeps are important, if we don\u2019t someone can fall and we get sued, my manger told me to do them every hour and I been trying. But I missed a few cause they get mad there\u2019s no carts when I\u2019m one person trying my best to do what I can.\n\n\nEdit: I make minimum wage and it\u2019s not that much. I asked for the cart key that unlocks the carts and she asked if I need the phone and she looked at the carts and said there\u2019s none and I need to do some. I asked for the cart key for a reason but I guess she didn\u2019t listen.",

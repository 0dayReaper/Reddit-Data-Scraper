    "postText": "I was really annoyed and upset yesterday after my first day at a new school. I don\u2019t have any reasoning for it but I was stressed.\n\nNormally I only ever see shadows or people walking and when I\u2019m in a silent room I regularly hear tons of people chatting or my name called. It\u2019s never enough to scare me and it\u2019s never enough for my parents to let me see a doctor.\n\nI\u2019m home alone, for context. I don\u2019t have school on Tuesday.\n\nToday I\u2019ve been hearing people in my house, hearing intruders, cars coming into our drive, when I was in the shower I turned around and saw someone just standing there at the end of my bath.\nI\u2019ve been scared the whole day, during my shower I heard someone come into the house and go through it. I\u2019ve been too scared to go through or upstairs, I need to dry my hair but I don\u2019t have the guts to go that far into the house. I can tell when I\u2019m hearing things since the dogs don\u2019t bark, but it still sounds very real. I hear every step, I can hear when they cross certain parts of the floor that creek, doors swinging and handles turning. I can hear their clothes moving as they walk, it\u2019s so terrible. \nI\u2019ve gone from seeing a shadow walking in my peripheral to being scared of moving in my own house.\n\nIdk what to do, as I\u2019m writing this I still hear the door opening and closing as if someone is there, I check the cctv as it happens and nothing is there, thankfully.",

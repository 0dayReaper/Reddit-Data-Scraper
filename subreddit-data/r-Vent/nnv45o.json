    "postText": "I was at the grocery store earlier. This guy sneezes, so I say 'Bless you', just to be polite. Y'know what a good response to that is? It's 'thank you'. I don't believe in a higher power, but I still say 'thank you', because I'm not a jag. Shit, I'd take a minor nod, or even fucking silence while you wholesale ignore my entire existence. I'm not particularly socially outgoing, so I'd ***loooooove*** to just be ignored.\n\nYou know what the wrong answer is? It's 'No thank you', and then launching into a 3 minute diatribe about how you don't believe in one or many gods, or how it's not the stone age, or how much more 'evolved' and 'enlightened' you are because you don't believe in religion.\n\nWhy don't you 'evolve' into someone who takes a shower, or be 'enlightened' enough to shave your shitty patchy neckbeard.\n\nI could maybe understand if it was some angsty teenager, but this was a guy who looked like he was in his 30s, *at least.*\n\nYou're not cool, and I'm pretty sure that everyone that saw you turn beet red while ranting at a stranger at a Safeway thought that you are a fuckwhistle. Grow up, and eat a fucking salad every once in a while.",

It's no longer a really religious term, it's like Christmas that is celebrated by anyone who likes to, regardless of beliefs. I think, no mater from whom the kindness is and what ever beliefs were once behind it, if someone cares enough to be kind to me, I will be thankful and be kind to them.",

The manager asked him if his meal was to his liking and if his ordered items showed up on time, everything was satisfactory apparently. His argument was that she didn't take anything over to them and that the bartender (me) brought our drinks and a different person dropped off our food. \n    My boss went on to explain (while this greasy Beachball with red frizzy hair literally shook on account of him being confrontational) that right as his server had put in their order, a Uber eats order had just been put in the window and the driver was already there to pick it up. Being that it was a catering order she took an extra few minutes to load the bags, inventory the order and help the driver out by taking it out with him so he didn't have to make a bunch of trips. Since that was a load off the hostess duties as well as the bartenders this was why we, as a team, pitched in to make sure the guests were taken care of while she tended to the other orders. Ginger Highlander was clearly speechless and when my boss told him if he still felt the need to stiff the server it was his choice. Just then I made eye contact with his companion and she looked like she'd watched her boyfriend slap a baby. He put a fiver on the table and slinked out the door with his girlfriend getting ready to give him a serious tongue lashing.",

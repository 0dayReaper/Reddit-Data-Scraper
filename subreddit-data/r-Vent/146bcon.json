    "postText": "Yesterday on call she asked if I was having kids. I told her no, I don't plan on it. \n\nShe asked why? I gave her my reasons (avoiding generational trauma, fear of fucking up, my mentality is shit. And I want to have my full focus on my dream)\n\nShe told me\"you'll change your mind\" I shook my head and told her \"I made a vow to never have kids\" and I still have that vow. I avoided sex because of the fear of getting pregnant.\n\nThe bloodline ends with me, I don't want the child to suffer like how I did. Nor do I want to fuck up my dreams.\n\nShe told me she was disappointed in me, that I would be lonely with no one to take care of me when I grow old. \n\nToo bad. If I die alone. I die alone....",

I've also been attacked and targeted by people online for my choice in not having kids. \nThey should mind their own business, unfortunately they can't seem to do it.\n\n\nAlso, I know about the health complications of Child birth and how the pregnancy experience is not all what it seems like.\n\nWhen I've gotten enough money, I'm having my entire uterus removed so I really won't have children.",

    "postText": "I feel like I'm falling behind. Everyone around me has what they want. They seem to know what to do and how to achieve what they want. My friend has been able to move out and has a job. Another has been able to achieve a big goal that they had been working to for a long time. I however am doing nothing good. I haven't achieved anything. I don't have a job yet, I still love with my mum and family. I may not even be able to do my second level course due to not being able to afford it. I'm trying to get a job and am working on contacting someone who might hire me. Even with that I feel that nothing I do will stop me from falling behind everyone else. I used to know what was happening and what to do to get my goals but now I no longer know what to do, where to go or anything anymore. I've lost my sense of self feeling like no matter what I'm just wearing a mask that makes me appear that I know what's going on. This mask has become something I can no longer tell from myself. They feel too interwoven. I don't want to be that mask, I want to be myself but I don't know what myself is anymore. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry for this mess of text",

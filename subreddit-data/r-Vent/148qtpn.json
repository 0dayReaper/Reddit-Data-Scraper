    "postText": "you know how everyone talks about \"you're your own main character\" or \"when you realize your side characters are main characters in their own stories\", it made me realize i'm not the main character in my story. i know it sounds weird but it doesn't feel like that. does anybody else feel the same way? \n\nlike i'm so boring. and unimportant to everyone. and it really hurts to see it when you really care about a person. people only talk to me when they need something. i'm just really irrelevant to everyone. i'm like the really useless side character who does their own thing in a corner. \ni know it sounds really childish but i realized i am so unimportant to my best friend of so many years she literally ignored getting a present for my bday. i was like okay maybe she was busy, hadn't time but it's been over a month and i doubt i'll get something. it's just that it's the second time i got her a really meaningful thing and i also wrote her something, but when i don't get anything back i feel like i'm unimportant to her. that if i mattered she would have done something. i wasn't expecting much. she could've just wrote me something. \nsorry for the random rant.",

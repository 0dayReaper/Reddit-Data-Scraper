Work to escape or escape to escape, the choice is yours\n\n2a. Ignorance is bliss- Work. You sit in your Tesla, realize bills are paid, life is good. You barely sit above the poverty line.\n\n2b. Work. Get home, take a hit, take a drag, take a drink. Work. Repeat. You barely sit above the poverty line, but the euphoria is nice. You rolled doubles, go again.\n\n3. Time passes, people pass. You lie awake and realize shits fucked. Beep beep. Beep beep. Time to clock in again.\n\n4. Retirement. \n\nRetirement 1. You now have exchanged enough of your time to enjoy a dream you cannot. You lie down after fastening the batteries in the remote, slowly settle in. You fall asleep.\n\n [ Times up! Game Over. ]\n\n\nRetirement 2. You take a few more shots as the smell of smoldering ash permeates the room. You slowly drift off into the euphoria. You fall asleep.\n\n[ Times up! Game Over. ]\n\n\n( Secret ending...? ) A balance. Either way you die lol.",

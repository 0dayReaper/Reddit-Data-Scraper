    "postText": "I stayed up which means I am constantly thinking about everything and it is depressing me to my core at the same time I try to never think about it to much because I end up in a continuous thought pattern for weeks about several things that I can\u2019t change the things that impact me as whole I hate being the eldest daughter to a single mother sometimes I hate being unfortunate looking luckily being slim and curvy makes up for it but not my chest so I fixate on that a lot I hate my acne but at least they\u2019re mostly marks I can cover with makeup but I rarely ever feel the wind of outside with a bare face I hate having ugly Afro curly hair that never fucking grows and not knowing how to properly take care for it and having it in one ugly hairstyle all the time I hate not being able to ever be in my own room ever again until I move out because we are so fckinf poor and I can\u2019t even find a stupid job in the first place I don\u2019t have any close friends I could have but that probably faded away by now college is shit i hate being a girl because I never felt feminine in the first place because I don\u2019t look feminine I hate my hairy body so much again it makes me look like a fucking man and yeah I could get laser when I\u2019m older but that would to be too much money spent on my body also I hate my stupid crooked teeth my mum can\u2019t even bother to help me get braces I hate every ficking thing right now and it\u2019s funny how I felt like this last year I thought it could change but it\u2019s just been another stagnant year I can\u2019t wait to just move out and have my own space for my thoughts my stuff for me only at least I\u2019ll have a place to belong to w while everything else went to shit",

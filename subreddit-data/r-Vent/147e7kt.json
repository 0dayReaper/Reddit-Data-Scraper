    "postText": "I thought that the stupid red pill alpha male podcast crap was for loser young men who have never known what love is and never will. But now I have noticed my fifty something year old dad has been influenced by them? He has started referring to women as females and keeps trying to construct the most ridiculous gender dichotomies. He sounds like his understanding of feminism came from tiktok. \n\nThis very much feels like a betrayal considering that I'm his daughter. I obviously wasn't under the impression my dad was perfect but until recently I had felt that at most he had like, the standard unexamined biases general society gives you about men vs women. He was the type of man who could be called a man. He was taught chivalry by his father from a young age, and our family mostly consists of an incredibly diverse and successful group of women who have taken traditional and non traditional paths in life, and he is a family man who has always been supportive of his sisters and daughters and nieces. \n\nSo wtf is all of this about?! Does he not respect me anymore? Does he view the majority of his loved ones as subhuman? Does he not think *civil rights* are important? He called Andrew Tate \"the man\"! Self proclaimed human trafficker Andrew Tate?! Has he lost his mind? When was the last time he touched grass?\n\nIt makes me feel violent.\n\nAnyway he cried and apologized and deleted youtube off his phone and said he would get therapy but I'm still pissed. Because how am I supposed to respect him after this? It's absolutely pathetic.",

I thought that whole alpha thing meant guys can't/shouldn't cry or show emotion. Thought it would've been more difficult to change his mind if he really believed what he was hearing/saying??",

We were having dinner a couple nights ago and him and my mom started arguing and he said that me my mom and my sister were annoying to live with and women are difficult to deal with. The next day he called a family meeting where he expressed remorse and apologized. He cried because he's human and he loves us. So I hugged him and told him I love him. Like I said he's historically a stand up guy so he's not a total alpha beyond help. I'm just offput by the idea that if someone I looked up to began to lean on bigotry just because they might have been going through something personally",

He\u2019s got a crafty way of influencing young men with fragile egos by stating points about how horribly some of us get treated by women in todays society, then using that to justify anti feminist propaganda. Men, especially those who are outcast, ignored, or even rejected by women, hear this talk and sometimes start to develop a negative view about them. Other times, they think that acting like this makes them more masculine. \n\nThe good part is that he understands it\u2019s wrong.\nIf he made up to you and your family, ditched the whole alpha male tough guy persona, and realized it was an unhealthy mindset, I think in you\u2018re in the clear. For me it took my normally calm best friend brutally insulting me to realize how crazy I sounded.",

You bringing it up the way you did made it sound like you were making excuses. Like \"Well, who can blame him when that's all he sees?\". I can! He's a grown adult man who should possess critical thinking skills. I'm glad you know what feminism is, but this post is about my dad and *he* didn't. Don't try to make excuses for him.\n\nThis post has always said that he called Andrew Tate \"the man\". This implies that he has watched Andrew Tate.\n\nAlso this is literally a vent post on a vent subreddit. Obviously I haven't said any of this to my father and will be having calm and constructive conversations with him about the situation in the near future, as mentioned in other replies.",

Without a doubt the main values were Loyalty, honor, and valor.  When I say it is subjective, I mean to say that opposing deeds could be considered chivalrous depending on the circumstances.  It may be chivalrous to show mercy to a foe fighting for the neighboring lord, but it may also be considered chivalrous to show no mercy for the heathen.  In the extreme, it could even be chivalrous to raze a village should your liege command it.  \n\nMany mistakenly use chivalry as some sort of gentlemanly code of conduct with regards to treating women, but that\u2019s not really the case at all.  Of the written ideals of chivalry (which are not representative of what chivalry was for everyone everywhere, not even close) only one written source has a single sentence dedicated towards showing respect to ladies. \n\nI hope someone was able to learn something from this comment!",

I feel so bad she just snapped me from his phone. I thought that he at least liked me a little. I can\u2019t stop shaking and i\u2019m even more scared i\u2019m pregnant or something since he didn\u2019t use a condom. I don\u2019t know what to do he just used me for sex.",

This is why when you tell a guy you want to wait, you filter out the pigs. If a dude has no issues waiting then you can tell he\u2019s genuinely interested in you, if he doesn\u2019t want to wait then you know he\u2019s only in it for sex.  Just learn from your mistakes.",

A man will sleep with a woman cuz he can without even so much as liking them, and you cannot buy love with sex from a man... Ever.. I don't care what anyone says . I'm sorry you had to learn this instead of someone telling you... You seem like Avery nice young lady",

    "postText": "I just graduated university and have worked double jobs for years. I didnt celebrate my birthday this year nor my graduation. I couldnt afford it. I live paycheck to paycheck and although I love my job, it has been draining me recently. I work in homelessness and addictions and manage a team of therapists. Over the past two months, one staff member died and a second was admitted to the hospital due to a relapse\n\nMy team is broken with grief, and many were friends outside work. We were also short staffed in management, with only 2 working managers instead of 4. \n\nIve done so much overtime and feel like i have nothing left to give. I pulled out all my clinical skills. There were many bereavement requests, vacations, accommodatios, and grief counseling sessions organized for staff and our clients (many of whom are already high risk). Im now unusually stressed by our usual violent clients + psychotic clients- and these portfolios are an intrinsic part of my profession.\n\nI know ill be fine with a break, a vacation.\n\nBut how to afford it? A car skid into me (yay black ice) in march, and i had to put 10k down as a downpayment on a new car. The car payments and insurance are destroying me. And i just had to file taxes. I owed the govt 6k. Then there are home bills, groceries and regular things i cant avoid. I feel alone and helpless to bills that i can't foresee or control. And lawyer bills because I'm involved in a case (ex charged with insurance fraud, and he used my name without consent)\n\nI have nothing left for a break. And although i know ill be fine by October or November, i feel so...resentful and broken. I dont want to put myself last, but how can i not when money is so tight?\n\nAnd the worst part is that i feel alone. A friend of 13 years has recently ghosted me. I dont know why and despite reaching out, she has not given me any clarity. I have replayed so many conversations in my mind. She knows of all the recent events in my life, and i feel distraught by the loss of a close friendship with no closure.",

    "postText": "Just felt like I needed to get this off my chest. I'm awful at pvp shooting games. My friend got me hooked on Fortnite like a year ago now, and it's the first (and only) shooting pvp game I've really played. My poor friend, I feel terrible, he's trying SO hard to teach me to be better... But I just can't do it. I can't handle the stress and frustration that comes with dying over and over again, never seeing ANY type of improvement. He doesn't understand why it makes me so upset, but I just feel so stupid and useless when I play with him because of just how good he is. I'm contemplating dropping the game entirely at this point, because it's just making both of us upset. But he's gifted me so many things, I don't want his time and money to go to waste. I'm at a loss as to what to do.",

I only say that because I don't think a battle royal game for a newbie offers enough opportunities within a match to get good. Like a team deathmatch in COD gives you a lot of time to practice and you can play it against bots so you can practice as much as you want and raise the difficulty as you get better.",

I really didn't like Apex because it didn't offer many solo options. I do own bioshock and borderlands, but those have aim assist, so I don't usually count those. All the other games I play are similar to Skyrim and Little Nightmares.",

If you can get another game to play then Doom Eternal is a FPS you could try. \n\nIt could be that shooting games aren't your thing but I think it might be and correct me if I'm wrong that you're putting too much pressure on yourself when you are playing Fortnite to play at a level you're not at yet. You'll eventually get better but it takes time and everyone gets there at their own pace, I'm sure your friend would rather you enjoy your game time rather than get upset. \n\nAlso I don't play Fortnite but I assume it's crossplay as well and if thats the case then you're at a disadvantage anyways against PC players as well as anyone who's played shooting games for a long time.",

It takes a lot of time to get better. I found that playing similar games (third person shooters in general) helped me with my aim very greatly! You shouldnt take ur losses so seriously. Unless its competitive. Games are meant to be fun and loss is expected to happen along the way. If you\u2019re still not having fun after trying more, its okay! Play other games and avoid shooters! No shame in that",

I know it sounds super childish and if you look it up you\u2019ll think \u201cman this game is so colourful, it\u2019s definitely for babies\u201d but I can assure you that\u2019s NOT the case. It\u2019s a very colourful game that also requires strength and has ranked modes. I really suggest giving it a shot, it can help your aim in other shooter games! Maybe watch a gameplay on it. I would suggest buying Splatoon 3 since it\u2019s the latest release. Hope you get better at shooter games",

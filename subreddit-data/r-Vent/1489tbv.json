    "postText": "I have a 1 hour commute 1 way. New teams at work where formed for a new site 20 minutes from home, the dream. I wasn't chosen. I also wasn't chosen to get a highly desirable license even though I should of been.(I'm on a team of people who all have the license so I have tons of experience around the equipment).  I'm getting a degree at the moment to move up in the company, a highly desirable degree that they said they want but at the moment I am on the lowest rung of the ladder just getting screwed. I'm considering making a stink about not getting on the team. It makes me feel terrible getting my hopes up then getting them dashed. 1 hour commute just sucks",
